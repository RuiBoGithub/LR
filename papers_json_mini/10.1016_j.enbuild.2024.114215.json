The HVACs in super high-rise buildings commonly consists of variable air volume (VAV) systems, multistage chilled and cooling water systems, primary-secondary chilled water system in chiller plant, and the chillers combination is much more complex, leading to the significantly higher energy consumption than that of normal buildings. This paper contains field tests and comparative studies on the operation performance of HVACs in two super high-rise buildings and summarized representative issues accounting for the high energy consumption. Field test results showed that the annual energy efficiency of the whole HVAC system, before being commissioned, was only 1.79 and 2.15 in two projects. The HVACs, typically VAV systems, chilled and cooling water systems, all suffered from over-supplying and energy wasting. Besides, the chillers commonly operated with a low partial load ratio (PLR), whose energy performance was much lower than expected. Aiming to dig out the typical issues, analyses were carried out from external, internal factors, and their interconnection. Furthermore, optimization methods were put forward with corrected vital indexes. Results showed that proper control strategies should maintain the VAV system, multistage chilled and cooling water system operating with significant distribution temperature differences, tiny distribution pressure drops, and high energy efficiency, thus achieving energy saving and ensuring space cooling effects. Besides, the control strategies, especially the number control of chillers, were influential during the whole cooling season to ensure the chillers operate with optimal PLR and thus achieve better energy performance.

The carbon emissions generated by building operations reached 2.2 billion tons in 2020 and are still increasing [1]. Moreover, as the available land area decreases, high-rise buildings become more and more common in large-scale cities. In 2022, 2071 buildings with a height of over 200 m and 211 super high-rise buildings (above 300 m) have been built worldwide[2]. Research [3] showed that the 50-year life cycle energy consumption of ten high-rise office buildings reaches 51.78\u201373.64 GJ/m2, with a mean value of 61.81 GJ/m2. The CO2 emissions per unit area of super high-rise buildings are 1.5 times that of conventional buildings; thus, the super high-rise buildings should be the critical object of energy conservation and emission reduction. For the characteristics of high-rise buildings, the energy consumption intensity of HVACs appears significantly higher than that of conventional buildings [4\u20137]. On the way to achieving zero carbon goals of high-rise buildings, it is critical to improve the energy efficiency of HVAC systems [8,9]. To create a high-quality indoor environment, the variable air volume systems (VAV) are commonly applied in super high-rise buildings. For pressure bearing considerations, it is mainstream to set multistage heat exchangers in the chilled and cooling water systems. Meanwhile, the cooling source of super high-rise buildings is equipped with a primary-secondary pump system, which aims to provide chilled water to different building zones. The VAV systems often operate out of the actual building loads [10]. Wang preliminarily implemented a VAV system adaptive control model based on a genetic algorithm, and it could be easily applied to different forms of systems [11]. López developed adaptive control technology based on the model predictive control (MPC) method to improve the operating energy efficiency of VAV systems, achieving an average energy saving rate of 56 % [12]. Shi et al. proposed a partition control strategy for VAV systems based on a multi-objective optimization framework to reduce energy waste caused by oversupplying [13]. Studies have pointed out that almost all large chilled water systems suffer from low-temperature difference syndrome, which responds to poor operating performance [14]. Rishel proposed a variable speed control strategy for chilled water pumps [15], which marked the optimal frequency and number of multiple-pumps installations. Moore [16] set the valve openings as the control index for the chilled water system so that the operating conditions of water pumps could be regulated according to the cooling demand. Zhao [17] further pointed out that the variable flow control method, with pressure difference as an indicator, has better stability than others. Wang [18,19] studied the control strategy of chilled water pumps and developed an online adaptive optimization control strategy for chilled water systems containing intermediate heat exchangers. Through these strategies, the chilled water system achieved energy savings of 50.59 %. Gao [20] further proposed a coupling control strategy for the primary-secondary pump system, which significantly improved the distribution efficiency of chilled water system. Deng [21] proposed an optimization method for chilled water systems in high-rise office buildings, where the energy consumption of the entire chilled water system was reduced by 29.2 %. With the advancement of artificial intelligence technology, the MPCs based on artificial neural networks have been applied in recent researches [22]. A. A. Fram reviewed MPC methods applied in different scenarios and pointed out its excellent robust performance and transient response capabilities [23]. Some researchers began using data mining methods to study the operation optimization method of HVAC systems [24\u201327], and significantly improved the energy efficiency of VAV systems, chillers, and other equipment. Meanwhile, other scholars combine data-driven models with control methods and optimize the traditional PID control idea. Kusiak [28] developed a control model based on a data-driven approach that reduced air handling unit (AHU) energy consumption by 23 %. Deng [29] developed an MPC method based on physical models and data-driven models to improve the energy performance of chillers under different operation conditions, bringing an energy saving rate of 19.21 %. However, previous researches mainly focus on some specific devices of HVACs, and lacks an overall analysis of the whole system from terminal VAV systems to chiller plants in super high-rise buildings. As the structure of the HVACs in super high-rise buildings is more complex, various influencing factors are coupled with each other, which will cause the local optimization effect to be far lower than expected. In addition, previous researches were mainly carried out through simulation analysis, and absent of validation cases. Through case studies conducted in two typical high-rise buildings, this paper summarizes the inherent problems of HVAC systems of this type of building. This study has covered the terminals VAV systems to chiller plants of super-high buildings, aiming to reveal and settle these issues. 2 Analysis on the energy consumption and performance of HVACs 2.1 System description The studied projects are all located in the hot summer and warm winter zone of China, where the building cooling demand lasts for almost the whole year. Table 1 shows the basic information. Project A comprises a tower and a podium, with an overall floorage of 458,000 m2. The tower has the primary function of an office building, with 118 floors, 597 m in height, and a floorage of 320,000 m2. The podium has the main function of a shopping mall, with ten floors and a floorage of 53,000 m2. Besides, the underground B5-B1 floors are logistic areas with garage and equipment rooms, and the floorage reaches 85,000 m2. Project B is an office building with four floors underground and 67 floors above ground, and the total building floorage reaches 142800 m2. As for the HVACs in terminals of studied projects, the variable air volume (VAV) system is applied in the office building. In the shopping mall and logistics area, there is a constant air volume (CAV) system in landlord area and a fan-coil unit (FCU) system in tenant area. Fig.1 then shows the water system of HVACs in Project A. The ice-storage system is applied for space cooling and includes four direct-supply chillers and five ice-storage chillers. The designed cooling power of the project is 45400 kW, and the designed ice-storage capacity reaches 140,680 kWh. Besides, the chilled water system in cooling station is divided into primary side and secondary side with a bypass pipe to satisfy the cooling demand with different building functions. Furthermore, the chilled water systems in the tower terminals are divided into seven zones, as the tower has a height of 597 m. As shown in Fig.1, only Zone 1 is directly connected to the chilled water system in cooling station. Zones 2,3 and the podium are connected with cooling station through one-stage heat exchangers. Besides, Zones 4\u20137 are connected to the cooling station through two-stage heat exchangers. Fig.2 then shows the water system of HVACs in Project B, which uses a conventional chiller system. The designed cooling power of the project is 32670 kW. The chilled water system is divided into upper-floor and lower-floor areas, with the heat exchangers on the 35th floor. The CHWP-L serves the lower-floor area from the 2nd floor underground to the 34th floor, and CHWP-H serves the upper-floor area from the 37th floor to the 67th floor. For each floor, the chilled water system is divided into branch N to satisfy regular space cooling demand and branch E to satisfy the cooling demand of the data center. Besides, the cooling water system is specially designed, and the CTs are installed at the rooftop of 68F. Project B is located in an island city where freshwater resources are precious; thus, seawater is used for circulation in open CTs. Besides, considering the pressure-bearing demand, the two-stage heat exchange systems are installed between CTs and CHs, and the freshwater serves as cooling water in the secondary cooling water system and condensers. Tables 2 and 3 then list the basic information of main devices in cooling station of projects A and B. 2.2 Field tests and analysis methodology As part of analyzing the energy performance of HVAC systems in two projects, field tests were conducted to identify common issues in HVAC systems for super high-rise buildings. As shown in Fig. 1 ∼ 2, during the field tests, the water temperature, flow rate, and pressure of the chilled water system and cooling water system were monitored with time intervals of 10 min. Besides, the electric consumption of chillers, water pumps and cooling towers was obtained from local monitoring systems. After obtaining the operation parameters, some indexes were raised to evaluate the energy performance of the whole system: 1) The energy efficiency (COP) is a crucial parameter revealing the energy performance of chillers, which could be calculated using Eq. (1): (1) COP = Q e W ch where COP is the operating energy efficiency of the chiller; Q e represents the cooling power provided by chillers, with unit kW; and W ch is the electric power of the chiller, with unit kW. The practical operation of chillers follows an ideal reverse Carnot cycle. However, there is also a certain deviation from the ideal cycle. Therefore, the practical COP can be decomposed into the product of the ideal coefficient of performance (ICOP) and the thermal perfection (DCOP). The ICOP is the refrigeration energy-efficiency coefficient of the ideal refrigeration cycle (reverse Carnot cycle) under a certain operating condition, which is the upper limit of the chiller energy efficiency. And the ICOP is directly determined by the evaporating and condensing temperatures of the refrigeration cycle, as shown in Eq. (2). A higher Te with a lower Tc contributes to a higher ICOP. The DCOP is the ratio of the COP to ICOP, as shown in Eq. (3), which reflects the difference between the practical and ideal energy efficiencies of the chillers, as well as the internal efficiency of the chillers. (2) ICOP = T e + 273.15 T c - T e (3) DCOP = COP ICOP = f ( T ce , P L R ) where T c and T e are the condensing and evaporating temperatures respectively, with unit ℃; T ce is the condensing and evaporating temperature difference with unit ℃, which could be applied to represent the compression ratio of chillers. PLR is the partial load rate of a chiller, which is calculated with Eq.(4), (4) PLR = Q e Q e , r where Q e , r is the rated cooling power of chillers, with unit kW. The DCOP reflects the internal efficiency of the chillers, which is equal to the compressor efficiency under conditions with a specific Tce and PLR. For a constant-speed centrifugal compressor, the cooling power of the chiller is adjusted by opening the inlet guide valve (IGV) to adjust the flow rate of the refrigerant. With a decrease in the PLR and compressor ratio, the IGV opening decreases, leading to a decrease in the compressor efficiency. Therefore, for constant-speed centrifugal chillers, control strategies should be adopted to keep the chillers operating at a high PLR and rated compressor ratio to realize high DCOP values [30]. 2) The water transport factor was raised to evaluate the energy performance of chilled water systems (WTFch ), cooling water systems (WTFc ), and cooling towers (WTFct ), as described in Eqs (5)-(7), (5) WTF ch = Q e W ch (6) WTF c = Q e W c (7) WTF ct = Q e W ct where W ch , W c , and W ct represent the electric power of chilled water pumps, cooling water pumps and cooling towers, with unit kW. Then taking a chilled water system for example, the water transport factor could be further analyzed with Eq. (8), (8) WTF ch = Q e W ch = C ∙ G ch ∙ dT ch G ch ∙ g ∙ H ch η ch = K ch ∙ dT ch ∙ η ch H ch where C is the water heat capacity in kJ/(kg·℃), G ch is the chilled water flow rate in kg/s, dT ch is the temperature difference between supply and return chilled water in ℃, g is the gravity coefficient in m/s2, H ch is the head of chilled water pumps and also the pressure drop of the chilled water systems in kPa, η ch is the energy efficiency of chilled water pumps, and K ch is the constant coefficient calculated by C and g . It can be observed that the WTF ch is directly determined by Δ t ch , η ch , H ch , and the higher value of Δ T ch , η ch , and the lower value of H ch contributes to the higher value of WTF ch , which means the better energy performance of chilled water system. 3) The air distribution factor was raised to evaluate the energy performance of air systems (ATFa ), as described in Eq. (9), (9) ATF a = Q e W a where W a represents the electric power of fan in air handling unit (AHU), with unit kW. Then the ATFa could also be analyzed with Eq. (10), (10) ATF a = Q e W a = G a ∙ d h G a ∙ g ∙ H a η a = dh ∙ η a g ∙ H a where G a is the air flow rate in kg/s; dh is the supply and return air enthalpy difference in kJ/kg; Ha is air distribution resistance in Pa; η a is the energy efficiency of fan. It can be observed that the ATF a is directly determined by dh , η a , H a , and the higher value of dh , η a , and the lower value of H a contributes to the higher value of ATF a , which means the better energy performance of air system. During the field test, as there are too many AHUs in buildings, the dry-bulb temperature and humidity of supply and return air for each AHU are difficult to measure, and the dh is difficult to calculate. Therefore, the monitored supply and return air temperatures were collected from the local building monitoring system, and the air dry-bulb temperature difference (dTa ) was used to reflect the relative magnitudes of dh . Furthermore, for transient values of COP, WTF ch , WTF c , WTF ct , and ATF a , the transient cooling power and electric power of chillers, chilled water pumps, cooling water pumps, cooling towers and fans were used to calculate the relevant values. For average values of energy performance indexes within a specific time period, the accumulated cooling capacity and accumulated energy consumption of relevant devices were used to calculate the relevant values. 4) Considering the pressure-bearing demand of water systems, heat exchangers are commonly applied in super high-rise buildings. To ensure the space cooling effect, the approaching temperature ( Δ T he ) of heat exchangers should be lower enough to decrease the secondary supply water temperature. As shown in Eq. (11), the Δ T he represents the temperature difference between secondary supply water temperature ( t s , s ) and primary supply water temperature ( T p , s ), (11) Δ T he = T s , s - T p , s Then the heat transfer process of heat exchangers could be further analyzed with Eq.(12), (12) Q e = K he ∙ T s , s - T p , s - T s , r - T p , r ln T s , s - T p , s T s , r - T p , r = K he ∙ Q e G p C - Q e G s C ln Δ T he Δ T he - ( Q e G p C - Q e G s C ) Where K he is the equivalent heat transfer coefficient of heat exchangers in kW/℃; T s , s and T s , r represent the secondary supply and return water temperature in ℃; T p , s and T p , r represent the primary supply and return water temperature in ℃; G p and G s represent the primary and secondary chilled water flow rate, in kg/s. When G p and G s have the different values, set G = Q e G p C - Q e G s C , the Eq. (12) could be further calculated as Eq. (13), (13) Δ T he = G e K he ∙ G Q e - 1 + G Then when G p equals to G s , the Eq. (12) could be further calculated as Eq. (14), (14) Δ T he = Q e K he Obviously, increasing the K he , matching the G p and G s can decrease the Δ T he of heat exchangers, thus leading to the better space cooling effect of the whole system. Therefore, as shown in Fig. 3 , the analysis and optimization methods for water and air systems in HVACs could be classified into external factors, internal factors, and synergy control. 1) As for chillers [29], the external factors refer to the cooling demand of the buildings and the specific operating conditions of the chilled-water and cooling-water sides. When the Qe is fixed, the higher Te and lower Tc both contribute to the better energy performance of chillers. Then, the internal factors mainly refer to technical parameters or performance characteristics. For chillers, the internal factors include the adjustment performance of the compressor at different PLR and Tce . As mentioned above, the constant-speed compressor only adjusts the IGV opening to fit the variation in the PLR and compressor ratio; thus, with a decrease in the PLR and Tce , the IGV opening decreases and leads to a decrease in the compressor efficiency. So, the synergy control for chillers refers to the fact that under operation conditions with a specific Qe , the control of chillers, especially the number in operation, should be adjusted to obtain the optimal operation PLR to ensure that each chiller operates with a high DCOP. 2) As for the chilled water system, cooling water system, and air system [21], the external factors refer to the distribution flow rate (Gch , Gc or Ga ) and resistance (Hch , Hc or Ha ) of the system. When the cooling power and heat exhaust are confirmed, the distribution flow rate (Gch , Gc or Ga ) should be regulated to ensure that the distribution temperature differences (dTch , dTc or dTa ) meet the set value, avoiding the excessive water flow rate. Then the unreasonable resistance should be eliminated to decrease the Hch , Hc or Ha as much as possible. Additionally, the internal factors refer to the energy efficiency of water pumps and air fans. So, the synergy control for water and air systems refers to the fact that under operation conditions with a specific distribution flow rate and resistance, the operation numbers and frequency of water pumps and air fans should be adjusted to reach the relatively highest energy efficiency. 3) As for the heat exchangers, to ensure the space cooling effect, the approaching temperature ( Δ T he ) of heat exchangers should be lower enough to decrease the secondary supply water temperature. The external factors refer to the primary and secondary water flow rate ( G p and G s ), and the internal factor refers to the equivalent heat transfer coefficient ( K he ) under different G p and G s . So, the synergy control for heat exchangers refers to that during operation, the heat exchangers should be all opened to increase the heat transfer area, which contributes to the increasing of K he . Then the G p should be adjusted to ensure the lower value of Δ T he . 2.3 Analysis on the annual energy performance of HVACs Based on the building management system (BMS), the annual accumulated cooling capacity and electricity consumption of HVACs for Project A (2021) and Project B (2019) were obtained and analyzed. Fig. 4 then illustrates the accumulated cooling capacity per day. The space cooling period lasts for the whole year, and the accumulated cooling capacity of Project A reached 56.15 GWh in 2021, where the accumulated cooling capacity of the ice-storage system and direct-supply chillers reached 29.75 GWh and 26.41 GWh, accounting for 53.0 % and 47.0 % respectively. Besides, the accumulated cooling capacity of Project B reached 33.57 GWh in 2019. Using space cooling areas as a comparison, which are 373000 m2 in Project A and 142800 m2 in Project B, the accumulated cooling capacity per area reached 150.5 kWh/m2 in Project A and 235.1 kWh/m2 in Project B. Fig. 5 then shows projects A and B's annual accumulated electricity consumption. The accumulated electricity consumption of HVACs in Project A reached 31.44 GWh in 2021, and the value per area reached 84.30 kWh/m2. Where the energy consumption of ICHs, air system and DCHs were top three, which reached 9.34 GWh, 9.25 GWh and 5.07 GWh, and accounted for 30 %, 29 %, 16 % of the total values. Besides, the energy consumption of multistage chilled water system, including ICHGPs and IGPs, reached 3.91 GWh and also accounted for a considerable portion (13 %). In addition, the accumulated electricity consumption of HVACs in Project B reached 15.62 GWh in 2019, and the value per area reached 109.4 kWh/m2. Where the energy consumption of CHs, air system and multistage cooling water system were top three, which reached 6.77 GWh, 5.43 GWh and 2.28 GWh, and accounted for 43 %, 35 %, and 15 % of the total values. It can be seen that the chillers and air system consume more than 70 % electricity of total values and are the fundamental objects of energy conservation. Besides, as the cooling and chilled water systems are designed multistage in super high-rise public buildings, they should also be paid more attention to energy conservation. With detailed accumulated cooling capacity and electricity consumption of HVACs, the annual energy performance of critical devices and sub-systems could be calculated and analyzed, results are shown in Table 4 . As for Project A, the yearly average COP of ICHs and DCHs reached 3.19 and 5.21, which were lower than the rated values. Besides, as the chilled water system was designed multistage, the average WTF of chilled water systems was only 26.22, which showed poor energy efficiency. In comparison, the annual average COP of CHs in Project B reached 4.96. As the cooling water system was designed multistage, the average WTF of cooling water systems was only 14.57. In addition, the average ATF of air systems in projects A and B were 6.07 and 6.18, which also need improvement. It can be seen that the high-class office rooms in super high-rise buildings need higher indoor environment quality, and the closed windows make it hard to utilize fresh air for free cooling in transition seasons. Thus, the space cooling capacity of high-rise buildings is much larger than that of conventional office buildings. Then, due to the super high-rise building structure, the cooling and chilled water systems are specially designed to be multistage, and the energy consumption of water pumps is bound to be higher. As analyzed in Table 4, the energy performance of HVACs was not as good as expected. Then, this paper will explore the typical issues leading to higher energy consumption with methodology and indexes raised in section 2.2, to guide the optimal design and efficient operation of HVACs in super high-rise buildings. 3 Analysis on the typical issues leading to poor energy efficiency of air system As mentioned above, for the studied 2 projects and other super high-rise office buildings, the VAV systems were applied for a better indoor environment. Fig.6 illustrates the schematic diagram and control logic of the VAV system. For each VAV box, the supply air volume (Ga ), the air damper opening (D), and the indoor air temperature of control area (Ti ) are monitored. The control system of VAV boxes will calculate the air supply volume required (Ga,r ) by comparing the actual Ti with the setting value (Ti,s ). Then, the D of VAV box is regulated to ensure the actual Ga reaches the Ga,r . Besides, there are often setting values of maximum and minimum Ga for each VAV box; thus the actual Ga is adjusted between Ga, max and Ga, min. With the D of each VAV box regulated, the static pressure (Pa ) of the air flue is changed, then the operational frequency of fan (Fa ) in AHU is regulated to ensure the actual Pa to reach setting value, thus the total supply air volume of AHU (Ga,t ) is regulated. In addition, the opening of water valve is regulated to ensure the supply air temperature (Tsa ) to reach the setting value. Therefore, the setting values of supply air temperature (Tsa,s ), static pressure (Pa,s ), and Ga, min would directly influence the energy performance of the VAV system, and the chilled water system. Taking Project B for example, the hourly supply and return air temperature difference (dTa ), Fa , and actual static pressure of 124 AHUs were monitored by BMS, and Fig.7 shows the distribution of those 3 parameters monthly in 2019. Comparison between Fig. 7(a) and Fig. 4(b) indicates that the dTa varied obviously with the variation of cooling power, where the dTa could reach 6\u20138 ℃ at June to September with large cooling power, but the dTa decreased to only 3\u20135 ℃ at December to March with small cooling power. This means that all AHUs in Project B operated with a large Ga and small dTa , thus leading to poor energy performance and large energy consumption. To analyze the causes further, Fig. 7(b) shows the distribution of Fa of all AHUs throughout the whole year. Compared with Fig. 4(b), the accumulated cooling power reached 120\u2013180 MWh per day from June to September, then decreased sharply to 40\u201380 MWh per day from December to March. However, with about a 2\u20133 times difference in cooling power, the percentage of Fa varied from about 60 %∼80 % from June to September but only decreased to about 50 %∼75 % from December to March. That is to say, the Fa of AHUs hasn\u2019t been regulated in time with the wide range variation of cooling power. Then, Fig. 7(c) shows the distribution of static pressure of all AHUs. As the set values of static pressure were reset manually, they hardly changed over the whole year and remained at the initial values at the design stage. Therefore, with constant set values of static pressure, the Fa of AHUs changed slightly when cooling power varied obviously. Furthermore, the practical operation status of AHU-16 W with 36 VAV boxes on 8th Aug. 2019 was monitored and analyzed. Fig. 8 shows the variation of electric power and static pressure of AHU-16 W. Without reasonable control of VAV system, the static pressure remained at 240\u2013250 Pa along the working time, even at 12:00\u201314:00 when there are few people in the office. Hence, the Wa of AHU only decreased from 18.7 kW at 7:30 to 15.1 kW at 13:30. Fig. 9 then depicts the transient operation status of 36 VAV boxes at 11:00. As shown in Fig. 9(a), among the 36 VAV boxes, the actual Ti of 15 VAV boxes was within the set value of ± 1℃, while the actual Ti of 16 VAV boxes was more than 1℃ lower than the set value, which accounts for 42 % and 44 % respectively. Besides, there are another 5 VAV boxes with actual Ti more than 1℃ higher than the set value. However, the actual Ti of those 5 VAV boxes was between 20 ℃ and 23 ℃, which was in a state of overcooling. But as the set values were all lower than 21℃, their environment was still considered uncomfortable by the control system. As shown in Fig. 9(b), for 16 VAV boxes with actual Ti more than 1℃ lower than the set value, 12 VAV boxes had Ga operating at minimum value, accounting for 75 %. This means that the Ga, min was set too high, and the VAV boxes couldn\u2019t decrease the actual Ga even when the environment was overcooling. For 15 VAV boxes with suitable Ti , there were also 8 VAV boxes with Ga operating at minimum value. Therefore, the Ga, min could be decreased to avoid excessive cooling supply and save the energy consumption of AHU as well. In addition, Fig. 9(c) shows the damper opening per VAV box at 11:00. At this time, the set value of static pressure (Pa,s ) was 250 Pa and the Fa of AHU reached 35.1 Hz. Then, only 2 VAV boxes had damper fully opened, where the Ti,s was 20℃ and the actual Ti was 21℃, which were overcooling. The average damper opening was only 26.1 %; the small damper opening would lead to considerable resistance and hence cause the higher energy consumption of fans. The Pa,s could be decreased so that the damper of all VAV boxes could be opened to reduce the resistance. That is to say, the inappropriate manual control led to the VAV system operating with small dTa , large Ga , and large Ha , which then caused poor energy performance of the VAV system, as analyzed with Eq. (10). Thus the Pa,s and Ga, min should be adjusted based on the actual cooling demand. Based on the analysis, the optimization commissioning was carried out in Project B. Taking AHU-10E for example, Fig. 10 shows the commissioning process: 1) Before commissioning, the Pa,s was 250 Pa, and the Ga, min was 80L/s. In fact, 9 VAV boxes operated at the Ga, min, and the average damper opening was only 35.2 %. 2) For the 9 VAV boxes operating at Ga, min, the Ga, min was gradually reduced from the initial 80L/s to 15 L/s, and the actual Ga was gradually reduced. Then the supply air flow rate (Gsa,t ) of AHU was reduced from 26798 m3/h to 25175 m3/h, and the Wa was reduced from the initial 5.9 kW to 5.2 kW. The average damper opening of the VAV Boxes was further reduced to 32.6 %. 3) After that, the Pa,s was gradually reduced from the initial 250 Pa to 120 Pa. At this time, the Gsa,t decreased to 21769 m3/h, and the Wa further decreased to 3.2 kW. And the average damper opening increased from 32.6 % to 51.8 %. It can be seen that by reducing the Ga, min, the fan electric power could be reduced from 5.9 kW to 5.2 kW, and the energy saving rate reached 11.9 %. On this basis, as the Pa,s decreased from 250 Pa to 120 Pa, the energy saving rate increased from 11.9 % to 43.0 %. During the optimization process, the indoor return air temperature was unchanged and maintained at about 23 °C. The CO2 concentration in the return air increased slightly but was below 520 ppm. Hence, the optimization commissioning could achieve a considerable energy-saving effect while ensuring indoor thermal comfort. Similar issues were found in project A, and optimization commissioning was conducted for VAV systems; results are shown in Table 5 . Therefore, the Ti,s , Ga, min, and Pa,s significantly affect the operation performance of VAV systems: 1) The Ti,s should be set reasonably to avoid the over-cooling of indoor environment, and also avoid the fully damper opening of VAV boxes, which might mislead the control system to increase the Pa,s of VAV system; 2) The Ga, min should be set reasonably to increase the adjustment range of actual Ga to avoid excessive cooling supply; 3) The Pa,s should be set and reset reasonably and in time according to the space cooling demand. It is suggested that the damper opening of VAV boxes could serve as an adjustment basis. Once the damper opening of all VAV boxes was lower than 90 %, the Pa,s could decrease gradually to decrease the energy consumption. Once there are more than 3 or some VAV boxes with damper fully opened, the Pa,s could increase gradually to ensure the space cooling effect. With this control methods, the damper of VAV boxes could open as large as possible to decrease the Ha of the system, and the Ga was adjusted in time to keep a larger and appropriate dTa . Thus the ATF of VAV systems could be increased for better energy performance. 4 Analysis on the typical issues leading to poor energy efficiency of water system 4.1 Analysis on the operation performance of multistage chilled water systems Due to the limitation of water pressure, the multistage chilled water systems with heat exchangers are commonly installed in super high-rise office buildings. Taking Project A for example, three-stage chilled water systems were applied with a supply water temperature of primary, secondary, and tertiary sides designed to 5.7 °C, 7.0 °C, and 8.2 °C, respectively. And the designed water temperature differences are all 7.0 °C. The stability of multistage chilled water systems and the assurance supply water temperature have always been challenging targets to achieve and control. Fig. 11 shows the actual supply and return water temperatures of multistage chilled water system in Project A on 14:00 19th Aug. 2021. The data monitored on-site revealed that the supply water temperature from the primary side of chiller plant was 4.4 °C, which increased by 1.2 K to 5.6 °C after mixing through the bypass pipe with high-temperature return water from secondary side. After the heat transfer in the first stage heat exchangers, the secondary-side supply water temperature increased by 1.2 °C, reaching 6.8 °C. Then the tertiary-side supply water temperature increased by 1.9 °C, reaching 8.7 °C. Except for the slightly higher temperature on the tertiary side, the primary and secondary side supply water temperature met the designed values. The multistage chilled water system operated stably, ensuring a comfortable end-user environment. However, as mentioned in section 2.3, the WTF of chilled water systems was only 26.22, which showed poor energy efficiency. Thus, the practical operation performance and typical issues of multistage chilled water system will be analyzed with Eq. (8) in this section from aspects of dTch and Hch . 4.1.1 The operation performance of direct-connected chilled water system The direct-connected chilled water systems supply chilled water to AHUs directly. Taking Project A for example, Fig. 12 shows the supply and return water temperature (dTch ) of direct-connected chilled water systems of Zone 1 ∼ 7 and shopping mall from 13:00 to 18:30, 19th Aug. 2021. The curve graph on left side shows the variation trend of water temperature difference, and the box plots on right side show the distribution of water temperature difference. Then, Table 6 lists the operation parameters. The occupancy rates of Project A were very high, while those of Zone 4 and 7 were lower than 90 %, and Zone 1 ∼ 2 were fully occupied. To analyze the influence of setting values of differential pressure (dPs ) on the operation performance of a direct-connected chilled water system, the dPs of Zone 1 and 2 were set to 80 and 70 kPa, while the dPs of Zone 3 ∼ 7 and the shopping mall were set to the designed value of 120 kPa. With lower dPs , only one water pump operates in Zone 1 and 2 with frequencies of 31.1 Hz and 30.2 Hz. In this condition, the average water valve opening of AHUs reached 62 % and 71 %, with the average dTch reaching 7.2 °C and 7.4 °C, respectively. In comparison, with higher dPs , two water pumps were operating for each system of in Zone 3 ∼ 7 and the shopping mall, and with a frequency higher than 41 Hz. Besides, the average water valve opening of AHUs varied from 24 % to 51 %. At this condition, the average values of dTch were much lower than that of Zone 1 and 2, which were only 1 °C ∼ 4 °C. Especially for Zone 6 and the shopping mall, the dTch was lower than 2.5 °C, which was significantly less than the designed value. It indicated that the dPs significantly influence on the operation performance of direct-connected chilled water systems. However, in Zone 3 ∼ 7 and the shopping mall, the dPs were still set at designed values without adjusting with the actual cooling demand. This led to generally small water valve openings of AHUs while the water pumps operated at high frequencies. Then, the chilled water systems all operated in conditions of large flow rate and small dTch , increasing the energy consumption. Based on the analysis, the optimization commissioning was carried out in directly connected chilled water system in Zone 5, and Fig. 13 shows the commissioning process: 1) Before commissioning, the dPs was 120 kPa, and 2 water pumps operated with Fch of 43.1 Hz, total Wch of 14.3 kW, and average valve opening of all AHUs reaching only 39 %. 2) Then, with the dPs gradually decreased to 60 kPa, the Fch of 2 water pumps decreased to 35.9 Hz, with the average valve opening of all AHUs increasing to 64 %. Besides, the total Wch decreased to 4.0 kW, reaching energy saving rate of 72.0 %. It can be seen that, for direct-connected chilled water systems, it is necessary to readjust the setting values of dPs according to the space cooling demand to avoid unnecessary energy waste due to improper control parameters under partial load conditions. With similar control and optimization methods of VAV systems and fresh air systems, when there are some water valves of AHUs fully opened, the setting value of dPs should be increased; thus, the water pumps would regulate the frequency to increase the total chilled water flow rate. Besides, once there is no water valve of AHUs fully opened, the setting value of dPs should be decreased; thus, the water pumps would regulate the frequency to lower the water flow rate. With this control method, the water valve of AHUs could open as large as possible to decrease the Hch of the system, and the Fch was adjusted in time to keep a larger and appropriate dTch . Thus, the WTFch of direct-connected chilled water systems could be increased for better energy performance. 4.1.2 The heat transfer performance of heat exchangers influences operation performance of multistage chilled water system significantly For a multistage chilled water system, the heat transfer performance of heat exchangers has significant influence on the secondary-side supply water temperature, and also on the primary-side supply and return water temperature difference of. Theoretically, the water valve opening in the primary side is regulated to adjust the water flow rate and make the supply water temperature in the secondary side reach the set vale. Besides, the operation frequency of primary-side water pumps is adjusted to keep the pressure difference in the primary side of heat exchangers (dPp ) to reach the set value. However, during practical operation, the water valve opening in the primary side, the frequency of primary side water pumps were regulated manually, thus causing the poor performance of heat exchangers. As shown in Table 7 , the dTch in the direct-connected (tertiary side) system in Zone 4 ∼ 7 was only 4.3 °C, 4.0 °C, 2.1 °C and 3.9 °C, thus the secondary side chilled water systems could only increase the supply water flow rate to ensure that the tertiary-side supply water temperature reaching the set value. Consequently, the dTch of the secondary side in Zone 4 ∼ 7 reached only 5.1 °C, 4.1 °C, 2.4 °C and 4.8 °C. Then for the heat exchangers between the primary and secondary side, as the dTch of secondary side in Zone 4 ∼ 7 was only 3.3 °C, thus the dTch of primary side was only 2.6 °C, which also operated in conditions with a large flow rate and small dTch . That is to say, once the secondary-side dTch of heat exchangers is less than the design value due to the limited heat transfer capacity of the heat exchangers, the primary-side water flow rate should be increased to ensure that the secondary-side supply water temperature reaches the set value. In this case, the dTch of the primary side will also be less than the design value. Then for the Zone 2, where the dTch of secondary chilled water system reached 7.6 °C. But the insufficient heat transfer performance of heat exchangers led to an excessively large flow rate on the primary side, with a dTch of only 4.6 °C. On the other hand, the secondary-side supply water temperature was set to 7.0 °C, but the actual temperature reached 6.6 °C, already lower than the set value. This further indicates improper control of the primary-side chilled water system of heat exchangers, resulting in an excessive supply. Therefore, for the heat exchangers in the multistage chilled water system, the heat transfer performance should be enhanced, and all the Heat exchangers should be turned on to increase the heat transfer area, thus reducing the Δ T he between the primary side and the secondary side. In the meantime, the primary-side water valve should be regulated to adjust the primary side water flow rate, ensuring that the Ts,s reaches the set value. At the same time, the primary side water pumps would adjust the frequency to maintain the dPp at the set value. Hence, the heat transfer performance of the heat exchangers not only determines the operating conditions of the secondary side water system, but also affects the energy performance of the primary side water system. Poor heat transfer performance often leads to higher secondary side supply water temperatures, which then results in a larger flow rate and a smaller temperature difference of secondary side, increasing the energy consumption of water pumps. Therefore, the high heat transfer performance of heat exchangers is crucial for ensuring the stable and efficient operation of multistage chilled water systems. 4.1.3 The reverse water mixing in bypass should be avoided in primary-secondary chilled water systems Taking Project A for example, as shown in Fig. 14 , the secondary side of the central plant in this project consists of branches of the shopping mall, Zone 1, and High Zones, each of which is driven by respective secondary pumps. During the transitional seasons, when the cooling power is low, improper control of the secondary water pumps in each zone often leads to reverse water mixing in the bypass pipe between the primary and secondary chilled water systems. This results in the secondary supply water temperature being higher than the primary-side supply water temperature. As shown in Fig.14(a), at the moment of 11:00 on 18th Nov. 2021, the reverse water flow rate reached 94 kg/s, accounting for 20.5 % of the total flow rate on the secondary side. This resulted in an evident increase in the supply water temperature on the secondary side. Particularly for Zone 1, as shown in Fig. 15 , the supply chilled water pipe is located adjacent to the bypass pipe, when the high-temperature return water from the secondary side flows into the bypass pipe, it has not mixed uniformly with the primary side supply water and is drawn into the Zone 1 supply pipelines, leading to a high supply water temperature of 8.7 °C for Zone 1. In contrast, the supply pipes for the shopping mall and High Zones are located more than 20 m away from the bypass pipe, allowing for thorough mixing between the secondary side return water and the primary side supply water. Thus, the supply water temperature of the shopping mall and high zones reached 6.3 °C, which was 2.4 °C lower than that for Zone 1. On the other hand, the actual supply and return chilled water temperature differences (dTch ) of Zone 1, High Zone and Shopping mall branches were only 4.0 °C, 3.0 °C and 1.7 °C, which were all significantly lower than the designed value (7 °C). However, at this time, there were still one water pump operating with the frequency of 36.0 Hz in Zone 1, 3 water pumps operating with the frequency of 30.0 Hz in High Zone, and two water pumps operating with the frequency of 25.0 Hz in shopping mall. Therefore, the water flow rate of 3 branches could be decreased to increase the dTch , and also to reduce the energy consumption of water pumps. To address the issues, the operation state of secondary chilled water pumps was adjusted, and adjustment results are depicted in Fig. 16 . Firstly, the 3 chilled water pumps with the frequency of 30.0 Hz were adjusted to 2 chilled water pumps with the frequency of 30.0 Hz in High Zones. Then the 2 water pumps with frequency of 25.0 Hz in shopping mall were adjusted to 1 water pump with frequency of 25.0 Hz. Subsequently, the pressure differential setting value in Zone 1 was reduced from 150 kPa to 130 kPa. While the water pump frequency decreased from 36.0 Hz to 33.0 Hz. After the adjustment, the return water temperature of High-zones increased from 9.3 °C to 9.8 °C. The primary-side water valve opening of heat exchangers increased from 24 % to 78 % in Zone 2, increased from 22 % to 47 % in Zone 3, and increased from 19 % to 81 % in Zone 4 ∼ 7. Then the return water temperature of shopping mall increased from 9.1 °C to 10.2 °C. Besides, the average water valve opening of AHUs in Zone 1 increased from 46 % to 51 %. As a result, the reverse water flow rate in bypass pipe decreased from the previous 94 kg/s to 10 kg/s. At this point, even the primary-side supply water temperature increased from 5.6 °C to 6.4 °C, the supply water temperature in Zone 1decreased from 8.7 °C to 6.9 °C. Simultaneously, the total power consumption of the secondary water pumps decreased from 68.6 kW to 47.6 kW, resulting in energy savings of 30.6 %. Therefore, during practical operation, it is necessary to avoid large flow rate and low water temperature differences of secondary side caused by proper control strategy. Thus, the primary-side water flow rate should also be adjusted to avoid the reverse water mixing in bypass. This not only ensures or optimizes the cooling effect of terminals, but also reduces the energy consumption of the secondary-side water pumps. On the other hand, after eliminating the temperature rise caused by reverse mixing, the primary-side supply water temperature could be effectively increased, which could directly improve the energy performance of chillers. 4.2 Analysis on the operation performance of multistage cooling water system As the cooling towers are installed on the rooftop, the multistage cooling water systems are applied in Project B. As shown in Fig. 17 , the practical cooling water temperatures of multistage cooling water systems on 10:00, 17th Sept. 2021 were measured and presented. Under actual operating conditions, the wet bulb temperature of the atmosphere was 26.2 °C. At this point, the cooling tower\u2019s outlet water temperature reached 28.8 °C, resulting in an approach temperature of 2.6 °C. After the first-stage heat exchangers, the secondary-side supply water temperature reached 30.0 °C, with an approach temperature ( Δ T he ) of 1.2 °C. Following the second-stage heat exchangers, the supply water temperature on the condensing side, which was the inlet temperature of chiller's condenser, reached 30.8 °C, with Δ T he of 0.8 °C for the second-stage heat exchangers. It can be seen that the cooling water temperature rose 4.6 °C from the outdoor wet bulb temperature to the condensers\u2019 inlet water temperature. Then, the cooling tower achieved a heat transfer efficiency of 63.4 %, while the two-stage heat exchangers achieved heat transfer efficiencies of 79.3 % and 86.9 %, respectively. Thus, the overall heat transfer efficiency on the cooling water side reached 53.5 %, which was significantly lower than the conventional cooling water systems. The multistage cooling water systems also have larger energy consumption of water pumps. As shown in Table 2, the energy consumption of cooling water system, including all CWPs, PCWPs, SCWPs and CTs, reached 276.92 GWh in 2019, thus the energy efficiency of cooling water system was only 14.57, which was also lower than conventional cooling water system. Consequently, the performance of key equipment in the cooling water system not only affects the energy consumption of the cooling water system but also has a significant impact on the cooling water temperature, which in turn affects the operational performance of the chillers. Therefore, in actual operation, it is necessary to improve the heat transfer performance of cooling towers and heat exchangers, as well as the energy efficiency of water pumps, which ensures efficient heat transfer and reduces the energy consumption of the cooling water system. 4.3 Analysis on the operation performance of chillers Taking Project B for example, the energy performance of chillers is analyzed in this section. As mentioned above, the transient cooling power and electric power of chillers were used to calculate the relevant values for the transient value of COP. For average values of COP within a specific time period, the accumulated cooling capacity and accumulated energy consumption of chillers were used to calculate the relevant values. Based on the measured data, the average COP of the chillers per month was calculated, as illustrated in Fig.18 . The orange line shows the variation of average wet bulb temperature per month. The center of the blue circle shows the average COP of the chillers per month, while the area of the blue circle shows the accumulated cooling capacity per month. It can be observed that the average COP differs for different months. In the cooling season from May to October, which is characterized by high building cooling demands and high ambient temperatures, the chillers operated with low chilled-water temperatures and high cooling-water temperatures; thus, the average COP of the chillers remained relatively low (approximately 4.20 to 5.30). In the transition season from November to April of the following year, owing to the lower cooling demand and ambient temperatures, the chillers operated with higher chilled-water temperatures and lower cooling-water temperatures; thus, the average COP of the chillers rose to about 5.30 to 6.10. Fig.19 then compares the annual average COP distributions of each chiller in 2019. Among the 4 constant-speed centrifugal chillers with rated cooling power of 6331 kW, the 2# chiller had the poorest performance with an average COP of 4.60, while1# and 4# chillers had better performance with an average COP of 5.70. Then for 5# chiller with rated cooling power of 3623 kW, the annual average COP reached only 4.70. And for 6#, 7# chillers with rated cooling power of 1864 kW, the annual average COP reached 5.50 and 5.80 respectively. Then for 2#, 3#, 5# chillers with poor energy performance, and 6# chiller, Fig. 20 shows the distribution of transient COP across the entire cooling in 2019 with time intervals of 10 min. The abscissa shows the transient value of PLR, and the ordinate shows the transient value of Tce of chillers. As T ce represents the condensing and evaporating temperature difference, then T ce decreases with the decreasing of cooling water temperature and increasing of chilled water temperature. The scatter points in the diagram represent operational data of transient COP for the duration of the cooling season, taken in 10-minutes intervals. Besides, the blue histogram shows the frequency distribution of PLR and Tce . It can be seen that the COP of 4 chillers has the same variation tendency, that the COP increases with the increase of PLR and the decrease of Tce . The influencing rules could be explained with Eqs. (1)∼(4). With the decreasing of Tce , which means the increasing of chilled water temperatures and decreasing of cooling water temperatures, the values of ICOP increases obviously. But the DCOP is also influenced by PLR and Tce . Fig. 21 then shows the transient DCOP distribution of 2#, 3#, 5# and 6# chillers across the entire cooling in 2019. As the constant-speed compressor only adjusts the IGV opening to fit the variation in the PLR and compressor ratio. Thus, with a decrease in the PLR and Tce , the IGV opening decreases, which leads to a reduction in the compressor efficiency. Thus, the DCOP decreases with the decreasing of PLR and Tce . Comparing 2# and 3# chillers with the same rated performance. They both operated with relatively high PLR from 0.65 to 0.9, but the 3# chiller had higher Tce , thus contributing to that 3# chiller had higher DCOP, which then contributed to the higher value of COP. Besides, as 5# and 6# chillers have smaller rated cooling power, they often operate at night or at transition season. When the cooling water temperature was significantly lower than designed values, thus 5# and 6# chillers have much lower operated Tce than those of 2# and 3# chillers. At the same time, with lower cooling demand and improper control strategies, the 5# and 6# chillers operated with smaller PLR, which concentrated lower than 0.60. Then with smaller PLR and Tce , the DCOP of 5# and 6# chillers was lower than those of 2# and 3# chillers. Fig.22 further shows the difference in operation performance among different chillers. The abscissa shows the total cooling power, and the ordinate displays the PLR of the chillers. The scatter points represent operational data recorded at 10-minute intervals. The color scale represents the different chiller combinations, where \u201cmB + nM + oS\u201d indicates that m big-capacity chillers, n medium-capacity chillers, and o small-capacity chillers operate simultaneously. The vertical bars represent the rated cooling power of corresponding chiller combinations. Theoretically, a particular chiller combination will correspond to a specific cooling power range. However, it can be observed that the current chiller operation strategy is chaotic in that different chiller combinations supply the same cooling capacity. For example, to achieve a cooling power of 6000 kW, there are 5 possible chiller combinations. However, only one of these combinations operates with the most suitable PLR and highest COP, whereas the other five chiller combinations operate with lower COP and result in wasted energy. Table 8 presents the rated cooling powers of different chiller combinations and the lower limits of the PLR. Once the current chiller combination operates with PLR below the lower limit, a chiller combination with lower rated cooling power should be selected and adjusted. However, as shown in Fig. 26, numerous chiller combinations operated with PLR below the lower limit. Fig.23 shows the transient COP of chillers in different combinations. The abscissa shows the total cooling power, and the ordinate displays the transient COP of the chillers. The scatter points represent operational data recorded at 10 min intervals, and the color scale represents the different chiller combinations. The results show that for the same operational cooling power, the chiller combinations with higher rated cooling power operated with a lower PLR and a reasonably lower COP. This indicates that the control strategy of the chiller combinations is not suitable for adjusting the chiller combinations over time, thus leading to a low PLR and low COP. In particular, for constant-speed centrifugal chillers, a higher PLR could lead to a higher COP. Therefore, control strategies should be further optimized to improve the energy performance of the chillers. 5 Conclusions This paper conducted field tests and a comparative study on the HVACs from the air system to chiller plant of two super high-rise office buildings. Where typical problems were summarized and studied. Through the research and analysis, the following recommendations are made for optimizing the energy performance of HVACs in super high-rise public buildings: 1) The larger supply and return air temperature difference (dTa ), smaller air distribution resistance (Ha ), and higher energy efficiency of fans could contribute to the better energy performance of VAV systems. Thus, during practical operation, the static pressure (Pa ) of AHUs should be adjusted in time according to the space cooling demand. So as to avoid the operation conditions of large air flow rate, smaller dTa and larger Ha , which will cause the energy waste of VAV system and overcooling environment. hen optimization was conducted on the control strategies of 15 VAV systems, and the average energy-saving rate reached 53.8 %. 2) Due to the limitation of water pressure, multistage chilled water systems are commonly installed in super high-rise office buildings. This would not only affect the energy consumption of the water pumps, but also significantly impact on the operation temperature. The larger supply and return water temperature difference (dTch ), smaller water distribution resistance (Hch ), and higher energy efficiency of water pumps could contribute to the better energy performance of multistage chilled water systems. Therefore, it is necessary to apply suitable control strategy for the terminal direct-connected system to avoid over-supplying. Then, the heat transfer performance of heat exchangers should be enhanced to ensure the secondary supply water temperature reaches setting values and also to prevent the larger water flow rate of the primary side. The optimization was conducted on the control strategies of the direct-connected chilled water system, and the energy saving rate reached 72.0 %. 3) As for the primary-secondary chilled water system in chiller plant, it is necessary to avoid large flow rate and low water temperature differences of secondary side caused by proper control strategy. And the primary-side water flow rate should also be adjusted to avoid the reverse water mixing in bypass. This not only ensures or optimizes the cooling effect of terminals, but also reduces the energy consumption of the secondary-side water pumps. Then optimization was conducted on the control strategies of primary-secondary chilled water system, and the energy saving rate reached 30.6 %. 4) Due to the imitation of water pressure, multistage cooling water systems are commonly installed in super high-rise office buildings. To ensure the heat removal effect, the heat transfer performance of cooling towers and heat exchangers should be enhanced to ensure the lower cooling water temperature for chillers. 5) The energy performance of chillers is significantly influenced by the PLR and Tce . For different types of chillers, the optimal operation values of PLR and Tce are different. Thus the control of chillers, especially the number in operation, should be adjusted to obtain the optimal operation PLR to ensure that each chiller operates with a high energy performance.

        "dc:description": "The HVACs in super high-rise buildings commonly consists of variable air volume (VAV) systems, multistage chilled and cooling water systems, primary-secondary chilled water system in chiller plant, and the chillers combination is much more complex, leading to the significantly higher energy consumption than that of normal buildings. This paper contains field tests and comparative studies on the operation performance of HVACs in two super high-rise buildings and summarized representative issues accounting for the high energy consumption. Field test results showed that the annual energy efficiency of the whole HVAC system, before being commissioned, was only 1.79 and 2.15 in two projects. The HVACs, typically VAV systems, chilled and cooling water systems, all suffered from over-supplying and energy wasting. Besides, the chillers commonly operated with a low partial load ratio (PLR), whose energy performance was much lower than expected. Aiming to dig out the typical issues, analyses were carried out from external, internal factors, and their interconnection. Furthermore, optimization methods were put forward with corrected vital indexes. Results showed that proper control strategies should maintain the VAV system, multistage chilled and cooling water system operating with significant distribution temperature differences, tiny distribution pressure drops, and high energy efficiency, thus achieving energy saving and ensuring space cooling effects. Besides, the control strategies, especially the number control of chillers, were influential during the whole cooling season to ensure the chillers operate with optimal PLR and thus achieve better energy performance.",
