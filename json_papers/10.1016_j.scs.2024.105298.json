School of Mechanical Engineering University of Shanghai for Science and Technology Shanghai 200093 China Buildings are rapidly getting on top of the agendas of various initiatives aimed at enhancing the operational flexibility and resource utilization. Accurately and comprehensively assessing the flexibility potential of buildings is pivotal for unlocking and efficiently harnessing demand-side flexibility, thereby bolstering the overall development of the energy system. In this study, a novel transfer learning strategy based building flexibility potential assessment methodology is proposed. Firstly, the consumption profiles of buildings from heterogeneous industries (e.g., residential, commercial, and industrial) are physically simulated through building energy simulation tool. To overcome the performance degradation occurred in single-source transfer learning, a hybrid convolutional neural network-gated recurrent unit (CNN-GRU) framework integrated contrastive adversarial learning for multi-source time-series domain adaptation (CALDA), termed as CNN-GRU-CALDA is proposed. In this way, the source and target feature representations can be better aligned and thereby improving the prediction performance of target building energy consumption by leveraging multi-source building data (domain). Furthermore, an HVAC load response model based on consumer psychology is introduced in the assessment process to realize the comprehensive consideration of consumers with different preferences. Finally, experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed methodology. Results demonstrate that the proposed CNN-GRU-CALDA model performs better than other models with respect to extracting domain-invariant features and prediction accuracy. Besides, considering consumer psychology is more reliable and suitable to optimally exploit the building energy flexibility in practice.

The public building sector constitutes a significant portion of the total energy consumption in China (including operational energy and embodied energy arising from construction), where office buildings represent 30 % of the sub-industry's energy usage. In this context, energy-flexible buildings, including grid-interactive buildings or grid-responsive buildings, are developing rapidly to reduce global energy consumption without unacceptable compromise in services quality and therefore with little impact on customers (Tang & Wang, 2021). The continuous advancement of technologies for smart, energy-efficient and energy-flexible buildings has paved the way for coordinated building energy system management and the increment of demand-side flexibility. The introduction of carbon peaks and carbon-neutral targets ignites a profound transformation in energy development, accelerating the shift towards renewable sources like wind, solar, and biomass energy. While current research integrates wind and solar energy's temporal complementarity with the consistent production of biomass energy to enhance energy system flexibility (Ceglia et al., 2023), the unpredictability of these resources challenges maintaining flexibility balance, necessitating further exploration of demand-side flexibility. The energy flexibility of demand-side resources plays an integral role in building energy system management, and is of great significance for online control and optimization of building energy system (Balakumar et al., 2023). In order to alleviate the imbalance between the electricity production and consumption and maintain stable power grid operations, some studies have highlighted energy flexibility measures on the demand side to strategically modulate and optimize electricity usage (Kaspar et al., 2022; McKenna et al., 2021). Besides, the electrification of buildings comprises an additional incentive to generate further interest in the notion of energy flexibility due to the wider adoption of heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) system, on-site renewable energy generation technologies and electric vehicles (EVs) (Liu et al., 2023; Panão et al., 2019). In recent research, the energy flexibility of buildings utilized to reconcile differences between supply and demand has garnered increasing attention. A comprehensive four-stage framework designed for effective management of a competitive electricity market that encompasses both microgrids and smart buildings was proposed to exploit the flexibility potential of end-users, thereby enhancing technical capabilities and economic efficiencies (Fatemi & Ketabi, 2023). To provide demand-side flexibility, the potential role of heat pumps and smart charging of EVs in residential buildings was fully investigated (Pastore, 2023). As outlined in Annex 67 \"Energy Flexible Buildings\" of the International Energy Agency (IEA), building energy flexibility can be defined as the building's ability to manage its demand and power generation, and to fulfill demand-side control tasks in consideration of local climate conditions, user needs and grid requirements (Jensen et al., 2017). The general method to achieve energy flexibility of buildings encompasses three main strategies: demand response (DR), demand-side management (DSM) or flexible control of flexible resources (Houben et al., 2023). DR refers to the voluntary and temporary adjustment of electricity consumption by end-users from their normal consumption patterns in response to grid conditions, market prices, or control signals. DSM enables efficient user-side load management in the form of DR by means of rapid load tracking, spinning reserve, and other auxiliary services. It considers multiple factors such as the load requirements of participating DR users, environmental conditions, and user preferences, which can increase user participation and responsiveness. Hence, under the DR or DSM control, buildings are able to elastically adjust their energy demand, allowing for greater flexibility in achieving various control objectives, such as peak shaving, valley filling, load shifting, and energy cost optimization (Ebrahimi & Abedini, 2022). To explicitly quantify the DR potential of buildings and harness unlocking building energy flexibility, the energy flexibility assessment of heterogeneous buildings has received extensive attention and research. Under flexible control, the installation of distributed generation units enables buildings to participate in DR, which can transfer buildings from passive control into active dispatchable demand resources (Salpakari & Lund, 2016). In parallel, various distributed energy flexibility resources at the buildings\u2019 premises, such as thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs), lighting system and other electrical load, can be leveraged to facilitate grid integration. The flexibility potential of the HVAC system was evaluated and analyzed to provide ancillary services and prolonged load sheds without sacrificing the comfort of the occupants (Rotger-Griful et al., 2016). A novel approach was proposed to characterize the residential energy flexibility of shiftable appliances and EVs on single building level and aggregated level (Azizi et al., 2022). As an inherent property of buildings, building thermal mass (BTM) can be exploited to store or release energy by suitably modulating the room thermostat setpoint (Bampoulas et al., 2021). The essence of building energy flexibility potential assessment is to establish the relationship between building user characteristic information (such as electricity price, energy consumption, etc.) and response information. Unfortunately, during the initial stage of implementing DR programs, the absence of data on load response characteristics raises a rigorous challenge to evaluating the potential of building energy flexibility. When the information of the analyzed samples is insufficient, the existing information needs to be used to appropriately expand the analysis samples. Transfer learning known as domain adaptation is an effective method that addresses the scenario where users lack labeled information by leveraging existing labeled data to learn features for users (Gao & Ruan, 2020). The most prominent approaches in leveraging efficient learning across clusters of buildings are rooted in transfer learning, encompassing directly transferring control policies, or by transferring plant models between buildings (Weinberg et al., 2023). In transfer learning, two crucial concepts are involved: the source domain, which represents a different domain from the target domain (with different sample features and probability distribution spaces), but possesses abundant supervision information, and the target domain, which represents the domain where the samples of interest reside, either unlabeled or with only a limited amount of labeled data. A novel hybrid transfer learning strategy was proposed to enhance the building energy prediction performance with limited historical data (Fang et al., 2021). Transfer learning in this respect is widely recognized as a promising approach to improve building energy prediction accuracy by employing the knowledge learned from source domain (Mocanu et al., 2016). Based on single-source transfer learning, a general multi-source ensemble transfer learning framework was proposed to enhance the prediction performance of the target building by using multi-source building data (Fang et al., 2021). However, this approach relies on labels and therefore requires pseudo-labeling of target domain data, which poses a challenging problem and can potentially lead to classification errors. If the pseudo-labeling is incorrect, it may negatively impact the effectiveness of the model (Zhong et al., 2020). In this regard, multi-source unsupervised domain adaptation (MUDA) emerges as an appealing solution, which reduces the cumbersome labeling of unlabeled target domains by transferring knowledge from well labeled source domains. Domain adaptation can be viewed as a special case of transfer learning (Wilson & Cook, 2020). The existing researches on MUDA predominantly focus on image classification and rely heavily on data expansion or pseudo-labeling. Considering that the building energy flexibility potential assessment needs time-series data, how to effectively use the meta domain information of multiple time-series domains (in this paper, multiple buildings) and targets is a research focus of MUDA technology for building energy flexibility potential assessment. To improve the battery capacity estimation performance, an unsupervised adversarial domain adaptation method was proposed to tackle the problem of data dispersion and fully exploit the time-series characteristics of data (He & Wu, 2023). However, there are few studies on the application and development of unsupervised domain adaptation for building energy flexibility potential assessment. To fill these gaps, we improve the existing efforts by integrating CALDA to optimize the performance of building energy flexibility potential assessment. CALDA synergistically combines the principles of contrastive learning and adversarial learning to robustly support MUDA for time-series data (Azuma et al., 2023). Many energy performance analysis models (such as eQuest, TRNSYS, EnergyPlus and OpenStudio) has been extensively utilized in various design processes, including building energy consumption analysis, air conditioning system performance analysis and optimization (Kamal et al., 2019). Energyplus is used in this study to simulate the physical realities for residential, commercial and industrial buildings. As customers are the core of the buildings and corresponding DR programs, it becomes natural to study their psychology and behaviors which can directly determine DR quantity, DR duration and DR time (Qi et al., 2020). Currently, research on DR strategies between the power supply and demand sides has reached a relatively mature stage, elucidating the flexibility response mechanism from economic principles and consumer psychology perspectives (Lu & Zhang, 2022). Efforts in (Choi et al., 2023) shed light on the consumer's heterogeneous preference structure towards residential buildings to explore the marketing and policy implications for promoting demand. The study revealed that cost-related factors played a crucial role in influencing public acceptance of zero-energy buildings in Korea. Therefore, it is necessary to apply insights from consumer psychology and economics to enhance consumer uptake and optimal usage, thereby facilitating DR technology (Hobman et al., 2016). However, there are few studies to apply the psychological preferences of consumers to the building energy flexibility assessment field. Motivated by the aforementioned research gaps, the following research objectives are established for this study. Firstly, the EnergyPlus simulation tool is used to physically calculate the energy consumption of buildings from heterogeneous industries as multi-source domain datasets. Then, based on the principle of transfer learning, a novel CNN-GRU-CALDA framework is proposed to better predict the power consumption of target building. Finally, we highlight the integral role of consumer psychology in advancing the development of building energy flexibility assessment. To elaborate, the originality and main contributions of this paper are as follows: \u2022 The chief contribution of this paper is an innovative methodology to assess building flexibility potential based on multi-source transfer learning. The dynamic simulation models of buildings from different industries are developed for building energy consumption estimation. We procure the required fine-grained data at a high time resolution, and jointly consider the influence of meteorological, calendar and building thermal dynamics. \u2022 A novel CNN-GRU-CALDA framework is proposed to employ multi-source domain datasets to optimize the prediction performance of target building energy consumption without labeled target domain data. The proposed framework demonstrates significant improvements in terms of extracting domain-invariant features and prediction accuracy compared with common benchmarks. \u2022 Based on the principle of consumer psychology, an HVAC load response model is constructed to thoroughly investigate the DR characteristics of multi-type consumers. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we analyse the building flexibility events, and present mathematical modelling for building energy flexibility potential quantification and HVAC load response model based on consumer psychology. The building dynamic simulation models are constructed in Section 3. In Section 4, we dedicate to the detailed analysis of the proposed CNN-GRU-CALDA framework. Sections 5 and 6 revolve around case description and analytical discussion. Ultimately, the overall conclusions are drawn in Section 7. 2 Modelling methodologies 2.1 Building flexibility events Building flexibility events encompass situations where buildings possess the ability to adjust their energy usage, power demand, and other relevant factors in a flexible manner based on varying requirements and environmental conditions (Li et al., 2021). These events can include the responses of building energy management systems, such as load adjustment and energy storage/release based on the prevailing power supply conditions. The primary objective of building flexibility events is to attain optimal energy utilization, minimize energy consumption, and contribute to the energy system's flexibility and stability. Foteinaki et al. (2018) distinguish two types of modulations for building flexibility events, which can be categorized into upward flexibility events and downward flexibility events as shown in Fig. 1 . For instance, the indoor air temperature setpoints can be suitably modulated to exploit the inherent property of structural BTM during building flexibility events. Under the primes of satisfying thermal comfort requirement for occupants, the recommended values to maintain indoor temperature should be in the range of 24\u201328 °C (Lu et al., 2022). A common practice under reference control is to set the indoor temperature at 26 °C during occupied hours (8:00\u201318:00). In a downward flexibility event depicted in Fig. 1(a) and (c), the indoor temperature setpoint is increased by 2 °C for a certain time duration Δt Down, which can be used for building load peak-shaving and provides the downward flexibility for the utility grid. This strategy can discharge the BTM to compensate for a fraction of reduced energy supply. Conversely, in an upward flexibility event illustrated in Fig. 1(b) and (d), the indoor temperature setpoint is decreased by approximately 2 °C to charge the BTM for a certain time duration Δt Up. In this case, valley-filling of building electric load can be achieved and therefore upward flexibility can be provided. The reasonable deployment of building flexibility events can yield substantial economic and environmental benefits. To assess the potential for building flexibility events, corresponding flexibility quantification methodology should be applied for widespread deployment. 2.2 Building energy flexibility potential quantification method System flexibility requirements can be correspondingly divided into upward flexibility and downward flexibility according to the building flexibility events. This section quantitatively analyzes the energy flexibility of buildings, specifically their ability to increase or decrease energy demand during short-term building flexibility events. Using established quantitative indicators, the quantification method assesses the energy flexibility of various building electrical components, namely HVAC loads and uncontrollable loads (ULs), which provides insight into how much energy flexibility potential can be harnessed during flexibility events. The building energy flexibility of an HVAC load can be mathematically expressed as: (1) { F H V A C , t + = P H V A C , t + − P t b a s e F H V A C , t − = P H V A C , t b a s e − P U L , t b a s e (2) P t base = P HVAC , t base + P UL , t base where F HVAC , t + and F HVAC , t − are schedulable upward flexibility and downward flexibility provided to the system by the HVAC load at time period t. P HVAC , t + and P HVAC , t − denote the operational power of the HVAC load during the upward and downward response periods, respectively. P t base , P HVAC , t base and P UL , t base represent the baseline, HVAC and ULs power consumption under default control. The activation of an HVAC load leads to a different power demand after the end of the DR action. If the HVAC load is enlisted to provide upward flexibility F HVAC , t + or downward flexibility F HVAC , t − , the active power of the HVAC after response is calculated as follows: (3) P HVAC , t + 1 = P HVAC , base t + o S t a t e , t · F HVAC , t + − [ 1 − o S t a t e , t ] · F HVAC , t − where o S t a t e , t denotes the flexibility state variables of the HVAC load, which takes 1 for upward response and 0 for downward response. To reflect the response characteristics of the HVAC load during flexibility events, it is necessary to adopt a load response performance indicator that expresses the capability of a building to adapt its operation in response to signals from the grid. 2.3 HVAC load response model based on consumer psychology Under the DR incentive mechanism, HVAC can be favorably exploited to offer energy flexibility by adjusting power demand over a specific period of time. Due to the existence of the BTM, continuous variations of HVAC power with temporary and moderate curtailments do not have a drastic impact on customer comfort. Usually, the time scale of flexibility scheduling is 15 min to 1 h level. Within this time scale, the power grid needs to be scheduled and controlled according to real-time load to maintain a continuous balance between energy supply and demand. Regarding the operational flexibility potential of DR events, the 3-D operational DR potential distribution of customers in various operation conditions was demonstrated and concluded in (Qi et al., 2020). It is clearly shown that under the same incentive intensity, when the duration of DR is less than the time scale of 15 min, the amount of flexibility response of air conditioning loads does not differ significantly. In view of the above analysis, the time scale of 15 min level is selected to analyze the building energy flexibility potential. It should be highlighted that the end-users in different industries vary in their electricity consumption behavior due to the variability of the manager's control over the changes in electricity prices and the sensitivity of incentives, and therefore the response rate of end-users is also different. According to the principle of consumer psychology, there are three distinct types of consumer response to changes in electricity prices (David Glen, 2017). As shown in Fig. 2 , the consumer response behavior will undergo changes from the dead zone to the linear zone and then to the saturated zone with the increment of the incentive intensity δ . When the incentive intensity is in the dead zone and saturation zone, the randomness of the consumer response is minimal; when the incentive intensity is in the linear zone, the randomness of the consumer response exhibits a pattern of first increasing and then decreasing. Considering that the obvious randomness of consumer response only occurs in the linear zone, therefore the relevant parameters of the dead zone and saturation zone can be regarded as deterministic parameters, including the dead zone inflection point A ( r 1 , 0 ) and saturation zone inflection point B ( r 2 , r 3 ) . Conversely, HVAC is impacted by uncertainty factors that make it difficult to model with linear functions in the linear zone. To accurately depict the uncertain set of the load response of HVAC in the linear zone, the load response rate η HVAC is expressed as a quadratic function: (4) η HVAC = r 4 ( δ − a ) ( δ − b ) where r 4 is a stochastic parameter that considers the uncertainty of HVAC, and the randomness of r 4 can portray the stochastic characteristics of HVAC participating in DR in the linear zone; a and b are parameters of the quadratic function. By substituting the deterministic parameters of the HVAC response model into the above formula, the HVAC load response rate η HVAC is obtained as follows: (5) η HVAC = r 4 ( δ − r 1 ) [ δ + r 3 r 4 ( r 2 − r 1 ) − r 2 ] The deterministic parameters of the HVAC response model have differences among industries, while the stochastic parameter depicts the random characteristics of HVAC participating in DR in the linear zone and have similarities in their impact on the response potential of HVAC in the same industry. Therefore, the deterministic parameters can be used to depict the response differences of HVAC in different industries, and the stochastic parameter can be used to depict the response differences of HVAC in the linear zone within the same industry. 3 Building dynamic simulation model 3.1 Scenario description As aforementioned, EnergyPlus is utilized to construct dynamic simulation models for residential, commercial, and industrial buildings based on respective actual physical properties. By simulating the operation of building cooling, heating, and electrical loads under the influence of various external meteorological and calendar information (e.g., hour of the day, day of the week), the HVAC load demand for different types of buildings is obtained to jointly meet energy quality and occupant comfort requirements. The schematic diagram of building flexibility assessment scenario description is illustrated in Fig. 3 . MUDA, as previously stated, aims to transfer knowledge from multiple source domains to an unlabeled target domain. By rendering structured information from source buildings into the target building, discriminative feature extraction can be facilitated, resulting in improved generalization on the target building. 3.2 Dynamic simulation model for flexibility assessment scenario 3.2.1 Flexibility assessment for renewable integration The exploration of power system flexibility requirement and provision has undergone remarkable advancements in response to the pressing need for effectively incorporating renewable energy sources into traditional power grids. Flexibility requirements serve as vital resources to evaluate disparities between power supply and demand. These needs are assessed by analyzing repetitive patterns in system variables such as net load, load ramps, energy storage, and stability (González-Dumar et al., 2024). Given the substantial impact of weather on renewable energy output, integrating large quantities of renewables demands extra flexibility to ensure consistent energy system operation. The ongoing energy transition not only alters the flexibility requirements but also redefines flexibility provisions. Flexibility provision assessment is pivotal not only in delineating the range of adjustability, but also in ensuring the resilience and adaptability of the energy system amidst growing fluctuations. To build a more robust energy system, the assessment of both supply-side and demand-side flexibility provisions are broadly investigated, which significantly influences the system operators\u2019 decision-making process for more effective responses to dynamic energy demands and the variability of renewable energy supply (Srinivasan et al., 2023). 3.2.2 Dynamic simulation models for buildings As one of the largest components on the demand side of power systems, building electricity consumption has great potential for flexibility provision. To establish the dynamic simulation models for buildings, the physical models should be firstly constructed in 3D by SketchUp, in which the physical parameters of the buildings, such as geometric shape and envelope structure, are determined. Subsequently, regions within the building that possess similar thermal characteristics are divided into the same thermal zone. Then, building energy system, including diverse electrical equipment (HVAC systems, lightings, industrial loads, etc.) and energy usage behavior (zone occupancy rate, equipment usage rate, consumer psychology, etc.) should be tailored according to different types of buildings. Finally, the external meteorological parameters of the buildings, such as temperature, humidity, radiation, wind speed, etc., are set as input data. The building lighting system is controlled based on the surface illuminance data from meteorological sources. The research framework of building dynamic simulation model is displayed in Fig. 4 . In conjunction with the demand signals depicted in Fig. 4, the building users first determine the willingness to respond by considering electricity price incentives and flexibility event duration. Subsequently, the energy management system collects the building users\u2019 response willingness and regulates the HVAC load to provide upward and downward flexibility to the power system by adjusting the demand for power within the specified time slot. In this way, the established model could precisely simulate HVAC load demand of various building types under different influencing factors and deliver crucial insights into building energy flexibility assessment. 4 Flexibility assessment based on CNN-GRU-CALDA framework The building energy flexibility potential assessment based on CNN-GRU-CALDA framework is shown in Fig. 5 . The whole framework can be divided into four steps: multi-source time-series data generation, data feature extraction, model training and building energy flexibility potential assessment. Firstly, we utilize EnergyPlus dynamic simulations to quantify building flexibility and determine the energy flexibility potential for typical community building types. Secondly, we design a multi-source domain adaptation model for multi-source time-series data. To elaborate, we employ a CNN-GRU-based feature extractor (Gf ) to capture temporal features from input time-series data. Subsequently, the adversarial domain adaptation, facilitated by the feature extractor and a domain classifier with softmax outputs, helps identify domain-invariant features between the source and target domains and realize the precise alignment to overcome the data distribution discrepancy among multi-source domains. Finally, by reshaping the space through contrastive learning and utilizing contrastive loss across source domains, we enhance the performance of the multi-source domain adaptation model. We will dedicate to the detailed analysis of the two intermediate steps in this section. 4.1 CNN-GRU feature extractor The proposed method takes historical load data as input, builds a CNN architecture consisting of one-dimensional convolution layer and pooling layer, and extracts high-dimensional features reflecting complex dynamic changes of building loads. The extracted feature vector is then constructed into a time-series as the input of GRU network, and the internal dynamic changes of features are modeled and learnt. The feature extractor is designed to minimize source domain errors. By feeding the output of feature extractor F ( · ; θ f ) to task classifier C ( · ; θ c ) with softmax output, classification errors in the source domain can be minimized. Then, we update the parameter θ f and θ c to minimize the categorical cross-entropy loss using one-hot encoded true label y and softmax probability p . In order to process multiple sources L y ( y , p ) , we calculate the loss by extracting small batch of samples from each source domain distributions D S i ( i = 1 , 2 , \u2026 , n ) : (6) arg min θ f , θ c ∑ i = 1 n E ( x , y ) ∼ D S i [ L y ( y , C ( F ( x ) ) ) ] The categorical cross-entropy loss is adopted and defined as follows, where y i and p i denote the i th component of y\u2019s one-hot encoding and the softmax probability output vector, respectively. (7) L y ( y , p ) = − ∑ i = 1 L y i log p i To elaborate, the load data is leveraged as the input of the model, and the feature extraction is performed by using convolution operation to mine the correlation between the data. Then, the number of parameters is compressed through pooling operation to further reduce the data dimensions. Simultaneously, the dropout layer is included to randomly select neurons in the network according to a certain probability to prevent over fitting. The GRU layer is then used to handle the reduced-dimensional data and learn their temporal dependencies. Finally, a fully connected layer is used to transform the data into a one-dimensional structure, and the final output result is obtained. 4.2 Contrastive learning The CALDA architecture organically blends adversarial learning through a domain classifier with contrastive learning via a contrastive loss on an additional contrastive head in the network. Contrastive learning has two paramount functions: (1) group same-label examples together; (2) separate different-label examples apart. This process operates on the paired representations z of examples ( z 1 , z 2 ) . By utilizing a supervised contrastive loss based on a multiple-positive InfoNCE loss (Oord et al., 2018), we can obtain a result by processing the paired representations z of examples ( z 1 , z 2 ) using the provided projection representation z of a query, together with the corresponding positive and negative sets P and N , a temperature hyperparameter τ , and cosine similarity sim ( z 1 , z 2 ) . (8) sim ( z 1 , z 2 ) = z 1 T z 2 ∥ z 1 ∥ ∥ z 2 ∥ (9) L c ( z , P , N ) = 1 | p | ∑ z p ∈ P [ − log ( exp ( sim ( z , z p ) τ ) ∑ z k ∈ N ∪ { Z p } exp ( sim ( z , z k ) τ ) ) ] Ultimately, the weights are updated by aggregating the queries for each source domain and normalizing based on the total number of queries. Specifically, we use the source domain query Q S i , the pseudo-labeled target domain query Q T , the positive and negative sets P d , y and N d , y along with the indicator function 1 to update the model parameters θ f and θ z : (10) arg min θ f , θ z ∑ i = 1 n [ 1 | Q S i | ∑ ( z q , y q ) ∈ Q S i L c ( z q , P d S i , y q , N d S i , y q ) ] + 1 P L = True 1 | Q T | ∑ ( z q , y ^ q ) ∈ Q T L c ( z q , P d T , y ^ q , N d T , y ^ q ) The utilization of multiple domains in CNN-GRU-CALDA eliminates the need for contrastive learning between the source and target domains. Instead, contrastive learning can be conducted among the source domains to enhance the model's performance. 4.3 Adversarial learning Relying exclusively on the feature representation selected by the feature extractor may result in significant domain dissimilarities between the source and target domains. Hence, solely minimizing the source domain error may not lead to a satisfactory transfer to the target domain. Nevertheless, introducing the adversarial learning module can effectively remedy this issue by training a domain classifier (the \u201cadversary\u201d) to correctly predict the domain labels for each example and simultaneously training the feature extractor to make the domain classifier predict that the example comes from distinct domains. Accordingly, this approach can facilitate the precise alignment of source and target domains. A multi-class domain classifier is defined where the softmax output acts as an adversary. The domain classifier, denoted by D ( · ; θ d ) , follows the feature extractor F within the network. A gradient reversal layer (GRL) R ( · ) is placed between F and D to facilitate adversarial training. This layer scales the gradient by a negative constant − λ d during backpropagation. The classifier assigns labels to target examples as d T = 0 and to source i examples as d S i ( i ∈ { 1 , 2 , \u2026 , n } ) with given domain labels d ∈ { 0 , 1 , \u2026 , n } , and we subsequently update the model parameters θ f and θ d : (11) arg min θ f , θ d ∑ i = 1 n E ( x , y ) ∼ D S i [ L d ( d S i , D ( R ( F ( x ) ) ) ) ] + E x ∼ D T X [ L d ( d T , D ( R ( F ( x ) ) ) ) ] The above objective employs a categorical cross-entropy loss L d similar to L y , which takes domain labels rather than class labels. Specifically, it requires the one-hot encoded representation of the true domain label d and the domain classifier's softmax probability output vector p to calculate the loss: (12) L d ( d , p ) = − ∑ i = 1 n d i log p i 4.4 The hybrid CNN-GRU-CALDA neural network Zhou et al. provided an error bound for multi-source domain adaptation [Zhou et al., 2021]. (13) O ^ T ( h ) ≤ Σ i = 1 n α i ( O ^ s i ( h ) ︷ ( 1 ) Source errors + 1 2 d H Δ H ( D T ; D s ) ︸ ( 2 ) d i v e r g e n c e s ) + λ α ︷ ( 3 ) o p t . J o i n t h y p . + O ( 1 n m ( log 1 δ + v log n m v ) ) ︸ ( 4 ) d u e t o f i n i t e s a m p l e s The formula presented above consists of four terms. Term (1) represents the summation of errors from the source domain, term (2) indicates the divergence between each source domain and the target domain, term (3) denotes the optimal joint hypothesis of the mixed source and target domains, and term (4) deals with the problem of finite sample sizes. It should be noted that the first two terms have great relevance for informing multi-source domain adaptation methods, as they can be optimized. Conversely, when working within a predetermined hypothesis space, such as a neural network of a specific size and architecture, term (3) remains fixed. Likewise, term (4) pertains to the finite samples from both the source and target domains, which is determined by the sample size and cannot be increased for a given dataset. Initially, we train a task classifier to accurately predict labeled data from the source domain to minimize term (1). Then, we leverage adversarial and contrastive learning to better align the domains for reducing term (2). Specifically, we adopt feature-level domain invariance through domain adversarial training to align sources and unlabeled data from the target domain, as previously proposed. Furthermore, we incorporate a weighting parameter λ c to the contrastive loss and observe that the λ c multiplier used in the GRL R ( · ) can function as a weighting parameter for the adversarial loss. Consequently, we minimize the total loss during training by summing each loss. (14) L = L y + L d + λ c L c Table 1 provides the pseudo code of the hybrid CNN-GRU-CALDA neural network training process. In general, an overview of the proposed CNN-GRU-CALDA framework is concluded in Fig. 6 . The hybrid CNN-GRU-CALDA neural network consists of four main parts, including the feature extractor, contrastive head, regression predictor and domain classifier. 5 Case description 5.1 Research approaches Fig. 7 diagrams the research approaches for building energy flexibility potential assessment. In order to assess the potential of building energy flexibility, the study implements the method described in Section 3 to simulate and model each building using EnergyPlus. The simulation time step is set to 5 min to prevent transient oscillations and ensure the stability and convergence of the simulation models. It runs for one year (8760 h) and provides the annual heating, cooling, and electricity load requirements for the building. Of the 8760 h of derived data, 168 h (7 days) are extracted and displayed. The generated building datasets can be used to quantify the building energy flexibility potential at any given time. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed model in assessing the building energy flexibility potential data when the historical data of the target building is insufficient, we take different number of source domain buildings and target buildings with only a small amount of historical response data for experiment. We employ the CNN-GRU network to extract the time-series characteristics of the datasets, and use the CALDA model training to fulfill the assessment of the target building energy flexibility. As a result, we successfully overcome the limitation of insufficient historical response data for target buildings. 5.2 Experiment setup 5.2.1 Building model parameters Buildings can be divided into three categories based on their intended use: residential buildings, commercial buildings and industrial buildings. Each type of building exhibits distinct power consumption curves and characteristics owing to variations in energy-consuming equipment, calendar (working days, rest days), and building envelope attributes. For existing buildings, the physical parameters of the building remain fixed. Once a building is commissioned, its dynamic operational load primarily relies on the occupants\u2019 comfort requirements for indoor environmental quality and the optimal scheduling of building equipment. Table 2 presents the building area and thermal zone division for three categories of buildings. Among them, the residential building is a four-story structure with a total area of 6840 m2. It is designated for residential use and comprises a total of 30 rooms. The commercial building, on the other hand, spans five floors with a total area of 3792 m2. It serves as a shopping mall and office building and houses a total of 35 rooms. Lastly, the industrial building consists of four floors and has a total area of 3712 m2. It is primarily utilized as a factory workshop and encompasses a total of 20 rooms. To better reflect the diverse usage scenarios in real-life buildings, additional room types including office room, conference room, and equipment room are included. The thermal properties of the building envelope are listed in Table 3 . It is noteworthy that the thermal mass of the building components is determined by comprehensive consideration of the specific heat capacity, thickness, and density of each constituent layer. Occupants exert a substantial influence on the utilization and functioning of buildings, including indoor air quality, lighting and daylight requirements, as well as energy consumption. In this work, the residential building has a density of 2 persons per room, and the average per-person usage area for factory premises is 5m². The occupant density for commercial spaces is detailed in Table 4 . Besides, the hourly occupancy rates for typical buildings in the specified area are presented in Table 5 , with the top of each type of building showing the timetable for workdays and the bottom for holidays (weekends). The internal thermal gains of occupants, lighting system, and other electrical equipment are summarized in Table 6 . Other parameters related to the simulated buildings are given in Table 7 , including the window to wall ratio and operational parameters associated with the ground source heat pump (GSHP) and fresh air system in the HVAC systems. Specifically, B1-B4 are designated for residential, commercial, industrial, and office buildings, while B5 shares similarities with B2. 5.2.2 Sample setup We use Python 3.6 and deep learning framework PyTorch 1.7 to implement all experiments. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed CNN-GRU-CALDA framework in building energy flexibility potential assessment, we perform experiments on different number of source domains. Herein, multiple source domains for transfer learning are studied in the experiments, including single-source (S1.1, S1.2, S1.3, S1.4), two-source (S2.1, S2.2, S2.3), and four-source (S4) transfer learning models (8 in total). The results of each model are averaged 10 times to mitigate the influence of random effects in the experiment. 5.2.3 Hyperparameter tunings It is empirically proved that the model hyperparameters should be selected after data preprocessing to achieve optimal prediction performance. Table 8 summarizes the candidate hyperparameter tunings for model selection in the proposed transfer learning model. The feature extractor employs a CNN-GRU neural network, while the domain classifier, regression predictor, and contrastive head consist of three fully-connected layers. Dropout is commonly applied to prevent overfitting in deep learning and is set to 0.5 in this study. Simultaneously, the hyperparameter tunings of different transfer learning models are optimally selected based on highest accuracy on the validation set, including the L2 regularization weight, the base learning rate and the batch size of source domain and target domain. Each model is trained for 100 iterations with the Adam optimizer. 5.2.4 Evaluation metrics In this study, mean absolute error (MAE), mean square error (MSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and R-squared (R 2) are adopted to quantitatively evaluate the prediction performance of the target building energy consumption. The performance evaluation metrics are calculated by the following equations respectively. (15) M S E = 1 n ∑ i = 1 n ( y i − y ^ i ) 2 (16) M A E = 1 n ∑ i = 1 n | y i − y ^ i | (17) M A P E = 1 n ∑ i = 1 n | y i − y ^ i | y i (18) R 2 = 1 − ∑ i = 1 n ( f i − y ^ i ) 2 ∑ i = 1 n ( y i − y ^ i ) 2 6 Results and discussions 6.1 Verification of the building dynamic simulation models Fig. 8 displays the electricity load profiles of four types of community buildings during heating season, cooling season, and transition season. Intuitively, HVAC systems hold a significant share in the overall building load. Besides, we can observe distinct load profiles in residential buildings during heating and cooling seasons, driven by variations in individual occupant behaviors and preferences. Conversely, commercial and office buildings exhibit specific load patterns linked to operating hours and occupancy density. Industrial buildings typically showcase unique load patterns due to continuous heating or cooling requirements for specific industrial processes, leading to prolonged HVAC system operations. During transition periods, where buildings transition between heating and cooling in response to changing weather conditions, a distinctive load profile is evident. HVAC systems may operate intermittently during these transition periods, adapting to the evolving climate and building demands. Fully exploiting the flexibility potential of building HVAC systems is of pivotal importance in unlocking demand-side peak shaving and load shifting capabilities, ensuring power supply-demand balance, and enabling greater integration of variable renewable energy. It can be observed from Fig. 8(a) that HVAC operational data varies significantly among different types of buildings. Thus, when assessing the building flexibility potential, it is important to consider the variations in HVAC characteristics among different types of community buildings to obtain a reasonable and accurate building energy flexibility assessment. As expected, different types of buildings exhibit different flexibility characteristics in reducing energy consumption at durations when the total load is at peak values due to the existence of BTM. Besides, building HVAC systems exhibit substantial seasonal characteristics. To provide a comprehensive representation of the distribution of HVAC operational data, violin plots are used to illustrate the monthly distribution of HVAC loads in community buildings, as shown in Fig. 9 . It is evident that the HVAC data for various building types predominantly fall within a specific range, with some load data deviating from the central values. Furthermore, the HVAC loads exhibit distinct patterns, with higher demands during the heating and cooling season compared to the transition season. Based on the building dynamic simulation models, extensive data corresponding to various types of building HVAC systems and related influencing factors are obtained, which provides data support and comparative models for subsequent analysis of HVAC flexibility response characteristics based on CNN-GRU-CALDA method and flexibility potential assessment. 6.2 Performance evaluation of CNN-GRU-CALDA method 6.2.1 Distribution discrepancy of time-series data features t-SNE (t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding) is widely used to map raw data into two-dimensional space to visualize high-dimensional data distribution. Fig. 10 depicts the scatter distribution of time-series data features using t-SNE. Different colours in the figure represent the domain-invariant features distribution between various source domains and the target domain. There exist evident data distribution discrepancy between the four source building datasets and the target building dataset arising from variations in energy-consuming equipment, energy usage behavior, and building envelope characteristics. Consequently, it is not advisable to directly input different source building datasets into the same prediction model, instead, data adjustment should be performed as a prerequisite. The building energy flexibility potential assessment, reliant on time-series electricity consumption data, poses a challenge for conventional CNN methods as they struggle to adequately handle data distribution discrepancy and thoroughly uncover time-series data features. Fig. 10 reveals that the utilization of the proposed CNN-GRU-CALDA method extracts more concentrated domain-invariant features compared to using only the CNN method, effectively addressing the data distribution discrepancy of multiple source domains. 6.2.2 Prediction performance comparisons In this part, experiments are performed with different number of source domains to validate the effectiveness of the proposed CNN-GRU-CALDA framework. The prediction performance results of different transfer learning models for the target building power consumption are analysed and compared under short-term flexibility events. Fig. 11 shows the actual and prediction values of the target building power consumption using the transfer learning models with different number of source domains under flexibility events with starting time at midday (12:00\u201313:00). Fig. 12 illustrates the actual quantification value and model evaluation value of target building flexibility potential under downward and upward flexibility events in a day. It is evident that during the operating hours of the target building (7:00\u201318:00), the upward flexibility provided by target building is lower compared to non-operating hours. The provided downward flexibility is predominantly concentrated during the noon period (12:00\u201315:00), because the downward energy flexibility of the BTM (building thermal mass) is achieved. In these diagrams we observe the expected prediction data curves almost perfectly reproduce the characteristics of the actual data curves while maintaining its diversity, and thereby fully representing the practical operating conditions of the proposed CNN-GRU-CALDA framework. Besides, it can be seen that compared with single-source transfer and two-source domain data adaptation, the evaluation result based on the four-source transfer learning models is closer to the actual data, which proves the superiority of four-source transfer learning models. 6.2.3 Average performance evaluation Fig. 13 presents the average performance evaluation metrics for various group transfer learning models, considering different combinations of source domains (single-source, two-source, and four-source). The results indicate a gradual improvement in performance evaluation metrics as the number of source domains increases from one to four. 6.2.4 Model accuracy comparison To validate the scientific and stable nature of the model, the prediction results from the data in this study are used to compare the fitting degree (R2) between the results obtained by different prediction methods and the simulation model results. Analysis of Table 9 reveals that when historical response data for the target building is limited, conventional models such as multilayer perceptron (MLP) and long short term memory (LSTM), which do not undergo multi-source domain adaptation, exhibit inferior performance in the evaluation. In contrast, the proposed method in this paper, compared to other multi-source domain adaptation models, such as contrastive adaptation network (CAN) and CALDA, demonstrates a higher fitting degree between the prediction values and the actual values, thereby proving its remarkable prediction accuracy. In order to make a comprehensive comparison, several key performance evaluation metrics, including MSE, MAE, MAPE, and R², as outlined before, are employed to gauge the efficacy of each model. It can be seen from Fig. 14 that the performance evaluation metrics of each multi-source domain adaptation models all show great improvements compared to the conventional models. This is because multi-source domain adaptation models can more effectively utilize information from multiple sources to achieve more comprehensive feature learning. 6.3 Flexibility assessment results 6.3.1 Target building load analysis The weekly power profile of the target building (commercial type) during the heating, transition, and cooling season is shown in Fig. 15 . The target building consists of a total of 35 thermal zones, and corresponding HVAC parameters are set based on the type of each thermal zone. It can be observed that the target building load exhibits distinct temporal variations and seasonal fluctuations. The daily load peak-to-valley difference is significant, and the load peaks align closely with the operating hours of the target building. However, the ULs do not exhibit significant seasonal variations, while the HVAC load is noticeably higher during the heating and cooling season compared to the transition season, reflecting the seasonal characteristics of HVAC load data. Therefore, to accurately capture the load response rate distribution of HVAC at different time points within a day in the target building, it is necessary to consider the seasonal characteristics of HVAC. Subsequently, this study examines the flexibility response of the target building's HVAC system at a 15-min time scale, considering the dual impact of electricity price incentives and occupants' comfort. The HVAC system has temperature drift and ramping limitations during adjustments, while each thermal zone's air conditioning has an adjustable temperature range with upper and lower limits. Meeting the occupants' comfort requirements is achieved when the thermal zone temperature falls within the HVAC's minimum and maximum temperature settings. Fig. 16 illustrates the flexibility response of the target building's HVAC system considering real-time electricity price and occupants' comfort constraints. Using a typical day as an example, during peak periods (mainly from 7:00 to 12:00 and 15:00 to 21:00), which typically coincide with high electricity prices (purple area) and occupancy rates, HVAC systems respond to incentives by reducing their load demand to offer downward flexibility. Instead, during valley hours (mainly from 0:00 to 6:00, 13:00 to 14:00 and 22:00 to 24:00) with lower electricity prices (cyan area), building HVAC systems respond to price incentives by increasing their load demand, thus providing upward flexibility. It underscores the adaptability of HVAC systems to varying price signals, facilitating grid stability and optimizing energy consumption by responding differentially to peak and valley periods. To analyze the impact of building flexibility event duration, the peak period at 11:00 and the valley period at 14:00 are taken as examples. By adjusting the duration of real-time electricity price, the impact of flexibility event duration on HVAC load response rate at different time scales during cooling season is examined in Table 10 . Table 10 reveals a notable impact of varying flexibility event durations on the HVAC load response rate in the target building. When the flexibility event duration is less than 15-min, the HVAC load response rate shows minimal variation under the same electricity price incentive. However, beyond the 15-min threshold, increasing the flexibility event duration leads to a sharp decrease in the HVAC load response rate. This is because consumers cannot tolerate the loss of comfort caused by a long flexibility event duration. 6.3.2 Load response rate distribution The analysis results in Fig. 17 illustrate the HVAC response potential at different time points during various meteorological seasons in the target building. It can be seen that the HVAC load response rate is closely related to meteorological factors, target building operating hours, and DR incentives. During the operating hours, the HVAC load response rate η HVAC is relatively low due to factors such as its own electricity consumption. Despite increasing DR incentives, the maximum load response rate η HVAC , max ( = r 3 ) remains limited. However, during non-operating hours when the HVAC's necessary electricity demand decreases, raising DR incentives significantly enhances the HVAC's response willingness. By utilizing the load response rate η HVAC at a 90 % confidence level as the probability interval for the HVAC load response in the target building, we can derive the distribution of η HVAC at different time points throughout the day during various meteorological seasons. Fig. 18 presents the HVAC load response rates at 8:00, 12:00, and 23:00 during the cooling season in the target building. The yellow shaded area represents the potential values of the HVAC load response rate η HVAC under uncertain factors. The HVAC system begins to response when the DR incentives reach the initial level. As the DR incentives increase, η HVAC gradually rises. However, when the incentive price reaches the saturation point, further increasing the DR incentives does not result in additional improvements. 6.3.3 Flexibility potential calculation Fig. 19 presents the peak flexibility potential of the target building's HVAC system under flexibility event duration of 15-min, considering the maximum incentive value δ = r 2 for each time point. In Fig. 19, the gray area represents the unresponsive load of the target building, which includes the necessary electricity load from ULs and internal HVAC components. The yellow area represents the upward flexibility of the target building's HVAC system under maximum incentives, while the blue area represents the downward flexibility under the same conditions. It is evident that the target building's HVAC system exhibits considerable flexibility potential during the heating and cooling season, while the transition season shows comparatively lower flexibility potential due to reduced HVAC usage. 7 Conclusion The current power system is confronted with a high proportion of intermittent renewable energy integration and a trend towards diversified load development, which exerts additional pressure on the share of dispatchable flexibility resources on the demand side. This study addresses the issue of analyzing the building energy flexibility potential in the absence of historical operational data. To fully utilize the simulation datasets from source buildings, a novel assessment method based on multi-source unsupervised domain adaptation is proposed. In order to further invoke the flexibility potential of target building, the temporal response characteristics of HVAC under uncertain conditions are considered, and an HVAC load response model is introduced based on consumer psychology. Through theoretical analysis and simulation verification, the following conclusions can be drawn: 1) HVAC systems possess tremendous flexibility, which is closely tied to their application scenarios, and can be influenced by different industries and seasons. Based on the dynamic simulation models of buildings, considerable number of datasets corresponding to HVAC systems and their relevant influencing factors in different industries are obtained, thereby providing data support and comparative models for subsequent analysis. 2) Compared with other structures, the proposed CNN-GRU-CALDA framework is more suitable for extracting time-series data features and adapting multiple time-series domains, which can significantly improve the building energy prediction performance and effectively solve the problem of building energy flexibility potential assessment in the case of data shortage. 3) By comparing the evaluation results of only relying on the target building data and combining the target building data with multiple source domain building data, it is verified that four-source transfer learning models show an optimal prediction performance in this study. 4) Consumer psychological preferences may shape their decision making and behavior in participating DR programs. In flexibility assessment, real-time dynamic electricity price is implemented to achieve a more reasonable HVAC load distribution compared to the reference control. When flexibility event duration exceeds 15-min level, consumers' response psychology is greatly influenced due to the compromise of comfort. Therefore, it is critically important to jointly consider incentive price and flexibility event duration to maximize building energy flexibility potential.

        "dc:description": "Buildings are rapidly getting on top of the agendas of various initiatives aimed at enhancing the operational flexibility and resource utilization. Accurately and comprehensively assessing the flexibility potential of buildings is pivotal for unlocking and efficiently harnessing demand-side flexibility, thereby bolstering the overall development of the energy system. In this study, a novel transfer learning strategy based building flexibility potential assessment methodology is proposed. Firstly, the consumption profiles of buildings from heterogeneous industries (e.g., residential, commercial, and industrial) are physically simulated through building energy simulation tool. To overcome the performance degradation occurred in single-source transfer learning, a hybrid convolutional neural network-gated recurrent unit (CNN-GRU) framework integrated contrastive adversarial learning for multi-source time-series domain adaptation (CALDA), termed as CNN-GRU-CALDA is proposed. In this way, the source and target feature representations can be better aligned and thereby improving the prediction performance of target building energy consumption by leveraging multi-source building data (domain). Furthermore, an HVAC load response model based on consumer psychology is introduced in the assessment process to realize the comprehensive consideration of consumers with different preferences. Finally, experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed methodology. Results demonstrate that the proposed CNN-GRU-CALDA model performs better than other models with respect to extracting domain-invariant features and prediction accuracy. Besides, considering consumer psychology is more reliable and suitable to optimally exploit the building energy flexibility in practice.",
