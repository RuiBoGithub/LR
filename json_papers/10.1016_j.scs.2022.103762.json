Roraima nº 1000, Camobi, Santa Maria \u2013 RS, CEP: 97105-900, Brazil. Av. Roraima nº 1000, Camobi, Santa Maria \u2013 RS, CEP 97105-900, Brazil Energy Cloud (EC) is the future proposal for energy management but the point is that there is no regulatory framework for EC. Therefore, knowing how the energy regulatory environment works and the relationship between actors and processes in this environment will contribute to the proposition of a new, well-structured regulatory system. The objective of this article is to identify the processes and actors which compose the regulation level of energy systems, to establish the basic relationships between these actors and processes, outlining the guidelines for the establishment and/or modification of policies, laws, and regulations related to the transition of energy management systems to the EC. The method used to achieve the objective was a systematic literature review (SLR) and the Apriori algorithm. SLR identified 7 main processes and 21 secondary processes, totaling 28 regulatory processes (outlined and presented through a mental map), being established through Apriori a network of dependencies between these processes with 37 direct links. 23 actors were identified that are structured in a network with 28 direct and dependent connections. The connections between processes and actors can serve as a starting point for creating a roadmap for the development of new regulations considering the implementation of EC. Graphical abstract Image, graphical abstract Keywords Energy management Energy cloud regulation Energy regulation process Apriori algorithm 1 Introduction The increased use of energy has led to the development of new technologies (de Carvalho et al., 2020) and the traditional power grids available are too primitive to handle the task of efficiently handling high energy demands (Mathew, Jolly, & Mathew, 2021). Another point to be considered is that in the US the electricity generation sector is the main contributor to GHG emissions and this indirectly causes the use of water resources, mainly for cooling purposes in coal-fired power plants. Therefore, although there is some water consumption during the production of renewable energy (RE) equipment, many RE technologies require significantly less water and this would be enough to drastically reduce water footprints compared to those of conventional power plants (Kelly, Onat, & Tatari, 2019). In addition, Wolfram, Wiedmann, and Diesendorf (2016) investigated the effectiveness of large-scale implementation of RE in Australia, assessing the total emissions over the entire lifecycle of different technologies. The results indicated that the use of different RE technologies can save a considerable fraction of Australia's GHG, which makes RE an essential option for climate change mitigation (Wolfram et al., 2016). Thus, with technological advances, the sector is going through a transition process (Rafindadi & Mika'Ilu, 2019). This technological evolution and the favorable regulatory context form a favorable scenario for the massive insertion of distributed generation, electric vehicles (Carmichael, Gross, Hanna, Rhodes, & Green, 2021). In this sense, the best configuration for energy systems is the one with the greatest management flexibility possible (Leithon, Werner, & Koivunen, 2020). This flexibility must be combined with the competitiveness of the energy market, regardless of who owns or controls the grid (Siddiqui, Macadam, & Barrett, 2020). This way, promoting changes in demand patterns through direct interaction and user responsiveness brings technical and economic benefits to the energy system (Melgar-Dominguez, Pourakbari-Kasmaei, Lehtonen, & Sanches Mantovani, 2020). The evolution of energy management technologies and algorithms will provide a reduction in energy waste through the possibility of changing consumer energy demand (Hashmi, Ali, & Zafar, 2021). In this context, traditional energy systems are supported by computational cloud environments so that energy management can be carried out more efficiently and effectively. Thus, the Energy Cloud (EC) appears. EC is defined as a platform for energy management structured following technical and economic aspects that make it possible to integrate RE sources into the network through technologies such as micro-networks, smart meters, storage facilities, IoT, cloud, big data, among others (Giordano, Mastroianni, Sorrentino, Menniti, & Pinnarelli, 2019). The main drivers for this transition from energy systems to EC are the massive insertion of RE sources, electric vehicles (Mohamed et al., 2021), and energy storage systems. A EC necessitaeá do uso de suporte computacional como uso de data centers. Cloud data centers have attractive features, but consume a lot of energy that has become a big problem. In this sense, Xu and Buyya (2020) proposed an approach to manage the carbon footprint and RE for data centers, by shifting workloads across multiple clouds located in different time zones, which can reduce around 40% carbon emission and being an option to that problem. Thus, the rapid evolution of energy systems through the integration of computational technologies brings a need for greater agility in the establishment and adaptation of policies, regulatory aspects, and legislation regarding these energy systems and markets (Schaefer et al., 2020) to attract investors and investments from public and private agents (Schaefer & Siluk, 2021). In this way, updates and modifications in the regulatory aspects are seen as necessary. Therefore, governments and policymakers are encouraged to take a leading role in implementing policies, laws, and recommendations that help to overcome challenges related to the insertion of renewable energies in more flexible and dynamic markets (Bishoge, Kombe, & Mvile, 2020). In this sense, it would be important to establish a system of triggers so that regulatory policies can evolve automatically over time (Arias Barragán, Rivas Trujillo, & Santamaria, 2017), and considering that energy policies are different in each country (Yun, Lee, & Lee, 2019) it becomes to be relevant research that seeks to outline the basic guidelines for the adoption and/or modification of regulatory aspects by the most different countries. Thus, this research is motivated by this evolution and technological transition of energy systems to the EC and by the need for research that addresses the regulatory bias, mapping and discussing all the processes and actors that integrate the establishment or the modifications of policies, laws, and regulations related to energy. Actors are represented by all the people who make up the energy system, such as energy suppliers and users, and public or private investors (Fischer & Toffolo, 2022). In this article, actors are understood as government energy regulators, independent regulatory agencies, electrical safety agencies, consumers, business actors, among others. Thus, the actors are all those involved in the energy regulation process or who interfere in decision-making during this process. By bringing this scenario to the context of cloud computing used in EC, it is necessary to establish the network of actors and processes of energy regulation to then verify the role of those involved and outline future guidelines. Thus, it is possible to establish the regulatory aspects on how to integrate new equipment and infrastructure to energy systems, in addition to the integration of users' energy management systems with the market, and how cloud providers can adapt to the use of energy efficiency metrics (Carvalho et al., 2021), and other tools that make up EC and cloud computing. Therefore, the objective of this article is to identify the processes and actors in the regulation of energy systems, to establish the basic relationships between these actors and processes, outlining the basic guidelines for establishing and/or modifying policies, laws, and regulations regarding the transition of energy systems to the EC. To enable the achievement of the objective, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was carried out with the extraction of theoretical subsidies that allowed the elaboration of a mental map with all aspects that make up the establishment and/or modifications of regulatory aspects for EC. In addition, the rules of the Apriori algorithm were used to establish the basic networks of processes and actors, to corroborate the previously established mental map. Among the contributions expected from this article, we can highlight the understanding and conceptualization of regulatory processes and actors, and thus, analyze how they can influence the development of EC and help to promote sustainable and resilient cities. In this sense, when mapping the relationships between the processes, it will be sought to facilitate the establishment of these regulatory flows, indicating similar activities, which can sometimes be condensed facilitating the process. Another important contribution of this article is the mapping and contextualization of each actor in this process, making it possible to establish rules and business models by positioning each actor properly in this process. The novelty of this study is the establishment of the relationships between the processes and between the actors of energy regulation through the Apriori algorithm, contextualizing these issues for the EC development scenario. In addition, there is still no regulatory body responsible for regulating EC (Carvalho et al., 2021), and knowing the processes and actors involved in this function is the beginning for the dissemination of this model of energy management in the cloud. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Sections 2 and 3 bring a literature review, Section 4 details the methodological procedures, Section 5 presents the results, Section 6 brings a wide discussion about the findings, and Section 7 presents the conclusions. 2 Energy cloud and regulation of the energy sector In the EC model, energy follows a bidirectional, flexible, distributed, and cleaner energy flow, connecting users to manage their energy through digital platforms (Carvalho et al., 2021). The EC allows the dynamic integration of different technologies in a smart grid environment and this scenario depends on cloud computing (Schaefer et al., 2020). Besides, it offers technical and economic conditions to support distributed energy generation contributing to meet energy demand (Giordano et al., 2019). This cloud computing offers resources that allow ubiquitous access to the network through configurable computational resources (Mell & Grance, 2011). In this context, the transition from the traditional energy grid to the EC provides great potential for energy savings. The smart technologies used in the EC are what contribute to energy savings, where IoT is essential for energy efficiency. Therefore, IoT devices are integrated with cloud computing to improve the management of information related to smart grids (Sami et al., 2019) and contribute to energy savings. The concept of energy sharing brought by EC, can contribute to the optimization of resources by redistributing idle energy (Li, Zhu, Chen, & Luo, 2021). IoT technologies provide minute-by-minute monitoring of data, resulting in effective energy savings and improved power quality (Reka & Dragicevic, 2018). Thus, in addition to effectively improving energy savings and user satisfaction, it also promotes RE sharing and storage (Li et al., 2021). Therefore, it becomes possible to carry out analyzes of the energy-saving potential and predict the usage profile, where users will be aware of their consumption and be able to progress in the behavioral change of conserving electricity (Carvalho et al., 2021). The EC does not yet have an implemented regulatory structure, implying that research and the establishment of minimum standards and requirements for this are still necessary. In the Schaefer et al. (2020) survey, the basic elements and requirements for EC and its management were presented. Carvalho et al. (2021), presented a series of technical, economic, and environmental regulations standards for EC management. In this sense, there is a need to modify regulatory frameworks around the world to adapt to the insertion of energy generated by distributed renewable sources (Giordano et al., 2019). This rapid insertion of distributed generation has generated concerns for policymakers about the resilience of the electricity grid (Zitelman, 2020), and the challenge here is how these policies can be adopted and implemented more widely among a greater number and diversity of governments (Armstrong, 2019). In that regard, energy systems have been undergoing a structural transformation that inevitably implies adapting energy regulation and adopting new regulatory policies (Vasconcelos, 2009). These energy policies must be formulated and implemented in a way that guarantees energy security and minimizes negative effects on the environment (Dahal, Juhola, & Niemelä, 2018). Lawrence et al., 2018 emphasize that what will contribute to the evolution of energy systems to the EC model will be the reduction of carbon rates, change of regulatory models, flexibility, promotion of renewable energies, and adoption of distributed energy resources. Thus, the contribution of regulation in the transition to new technologies related to the generation, distribution, storage and consumption of energy is noticeable (Carvalho et al., 2021). In this transition, the importance of knowledge about the regulatory process of the energy sector is evident, in addition to knowing the actors that are part of this process. Only in this way it is possible to propose modifications and improvements that contribute to a more decentralized scenario, which is EC. In this article, the processes and actors involved in the structures that carry out energy regulations are presented, contextualized, and discussed, evolving towards the establishment of a basic framework for regulations aimed at EC. 3 Materials and methods This research was done out in two steps. For the first step, an SLR was carried out to gather the necessary information and to structure the mental map which helps in the development of the research. The second step sought to develop a network to establish the relationship between the data collected in step one. 3.1 Step 1 - Systematic literature review The information gathered here consists of a survey of processes and actors that make up the energy sector regulation. This search in the literature followed what was recommended by Dresch et al. (2015), through a protocol that provides methodical research and results on the studied topic. Having a well-defined structure of research, an SLR can contribute to the advancement of the theory and, thus of knowledge in a given area (Lacerda, Dresch, Proença, & Antunes Jr, 2013). Table 1 shows the search time and summarizes the search filters used to retrieve articles from the Scopus, Web of Science and IEEE databases for the period 2010 to date. This period was chosen due to the fact that energy regulation is constantly changing, and in addition the concept of Energy Cloud is very recent. Fig. 1 addresses the systematic review protocol used to search for research data. The SLR comprises three main stages and eight secondary stages. The first stage arises from a research problem, being: \u201cHow to map the regulatory process of the energy sector?\u201d After that, the keywords for the search were defined, being: \u201cenergy regulation\u201d, \u201cregulatory agency\u201d, \u201cregulatory environment\u201d, \u201cpolicymakers\u201d and \u201cenergy\u201d, and that resulted in the following string that was responsible for the return of the articles: ((\u201cenergy regulation\u201d OR \u201cregulatory agency*\u201d OR \u201cregulatory environment\u201d OR policymakers) AND energy). This string was submitted to different scientific articles databases to analyze which are the bases that cover studies in the area. With that, it was defined that Scopus, Web of Science, and IEEE are the most adequate databases to retrieve research on the subject. These stages from the SLR comprise stage 1. Stage 2 comprises the search in the databases. The returned articles were cataloged in the bibliographic reference manager Mendeley, and after deleting the duplicated articles, the search resulted in 3770 articles. The next step was the application of the first filter, which consists of the inclusion and exclusion criteria, applied when reading the title, abstract, and keywords. The inclusion criterion was to select the articles that contained the keywords searched for in the title, abstract, or keywords, and the exclusion criterion was to exclude those articles that did not cover the searched terms. This step resulted in 114 articles extracted. The next step was the application of the second filter, which consisted of a complete reading of the articles extracted from the previous step. Here, only the articles that deal with information about the processes or actors of energy regulation were identified and selected, resulting in 45 articles. Stage 3 of the SLR consists of extracting the research data. Initially, the processes that make up the regulation of the energy sector were mapped and presented in the form of a mental map. Along with this, the actors in these processes were also identified. 3.2 Step 2 - Building the relationships network The objective of this step was to establish the relationship between the actors and between the regulatory processes in the energy sector regarding EC, through data mining techniques. Data mining meets sequential patterns with a display frequency that exceeds the minimum degree specified by the user (C. Wang & Zheng, 2019). Data mining comprises the tasks of association, classification, clustering, and estimation of data and information. To obtain the networks of processes and actors, this research made use of the task of data association, through the Apriori algorithm, effective to perform association analyzes (Zeng & Xiao, 2020). This algorithm was the first to extract patterns from data sets to determine Boolean association rules (Agrawal & Srikant, 1994). Apriori results serve to help direct efforts by bringing relevant insights in support of an SLR (Da Costa, Dos Santos, Schaefer, Baierle, & Nara, 2019). Thus, the use of Apriori contributes to highlighting the dependency relationships between actors and processes, indicating those that should be analyzed and discussed widely with support from the scientific literature. In this research, the WEKA data mining software was used to run the algorithm Apriori. Here, a matrix was used with the data (processes or actors) to be analyzed, and for this analysis, \"1\" meant a citation of an actor or process, and \"?\" it meant a non-citation. The file with the data matrix was converted to a *.arffk file to be compatible with WEKA and can be read. The application of the Apriori rules algorithm followed the following steps (Cheng, Xu, & Gong, 2016; Turčínek & Turčínková, 2015): I is considered a set of items: (I1, I2, \u2026, In). D is considered the database with transactions T as a binary vector with T [k] = 1 if T bought the item Ik , and T[k] = 0 otherwise. Each transaction T → I has an identifier k and for each transaction, there is a tuple in database D. A is a set of some items in I. Transaction T contains A only if A □ T. An association rule is an implication of the form A → B, where A □ I, B □ I and A ∩ B = Φ. Here, s is the percentage of the transaction in D that contains A ∪ B, so rule A → B holds in the set D with Support s. The probability is P (A ∪ B). The rule A → B has Confidence c in set D, where c is the percentage of transactions containing A that also contains B, then there is the conditional probability P (B | A). Another measure used in the Apriori rules is the Lift. This measure is related to the occurrence of A and B. Lift is a measure of the correlation between the occurrences of items. The Support, Confidence and Lift equations are those used by Schaefer and Siluk (2021) and are presented below as Eqs. (1), (2) and (3), respectively. (1) S u p p o r t ( A → B ) = P ( A ∪ B ) (2) C o n f i d e n c e ( A → B ) = P ( B | A ) (3) L i f t ( A , B ) = [ P ( A ∪ B ) / ( P ( A ) * P ( B ) ) ] This metric is evaluated as follows: if the resulting value is less than 1, it means that the occurrence of A is negatively correlated with the occurrence of B, if the resulting value is greater than 1, then A and B are positively correlated, and if the resulting value is equal to 1, A and B are independent (Da Costa et al., 2019). Thus, to build the actors\u2019 network and the processes\u2019 network for the regulatory process in the regulation of the energy sector, it was established that the Confidence should be equal to or greater than 0.8 and that the Lift should be equal to or greater than 1.0, and that the actor or process has been cited in 25% of the articles from SLR. Therefore, it is established that relationships that do not meet these criteria are excluded, thus structuring a network with the most relevant and dependent connections. Section 5 comprises the results, where the mental map of the processes is presented, followed by the processes\u2019 network and the actors\u2019 network. The discussion section is divided into seven subsections that comprise the main energy regulation processes (according to the mental map), and from the networks established with Apriori, the relationships between processes and actors were situated and discussed within the context of these 7 basic processes as a way to validate the results obtained. 4 Results This article sought to identify the processes and actors involved in the regulatory processes from the energy sector and to map out the relationships between these processes and actors. Thus, through an SLR, this information was cataloged. Table 2 represents the number of articles used to extract data related to the actors and processes. Therefore, from a total of 45 articles, 24 actors and 28 processes were listed. 4.1 Mental map of energy regulation processes The presentation of the energy regulation processes was systematized using a mental map (Fig. 2 ). Here, the processes do not have an exact order of execution, and therefore they were associated according to affinity. The central idea \"Regulatory process of the energy sector\" is at the center of the mental map, where seven main processes are derived. These seven main processes that makeup energy regulation are: Regulatory policy research, Energy codes and standards, Market-oriented phase, Standard development process, Government support, Administrative process, Credit financing/incentives. Each of these processes will be detailed and discussed in Section 6. 4.2 Presentation of the processes\u2019 network Table 3 represents the list of processes involved in energy regulation, the number of times that each process was cited, and the percentage that these citations represent considering the 41 articles. These data were coded as P1 to P28 to facilitate identification. Table 4 represents the Apriori rules that the processes relationships need to have to enter the network. Thus, the Confidence must be greater than 0.8 and the Lift greater than 1.0. In addition, to enter the network, the process must have been cited in at least 25% of the articles. Considering the rules presented, 18 of the 28 processes identified in the SLR are presented in the network. These relationship rules apply to the antecedent and the successor. To exemplify, according to Table 4, the association between processes P27 - Policy change and P2 - Government support can be used. Here, P27 is the antecedent (A) and P2 is the successor (B). Support is the proportion of times that each process is cited in the total number of articles, and it is necessary to establish this relationship. In this case, P27 and P2 appear together at least 17 times according to Table 4 in the column \u201cApparitions as successor\u201d and the total number of articles (41, according to Table 2). Support (A → B) = P (A ∪ B) = 17/41 = 0.4146 = 41.46% The Confidence association rule is obtained through the relationship between transactions containing A (18 times according to the column in Table 4 \u201cAppearances as antecedent\u201d) that also contains B (17 times according to the column in Table 4 \u201cAppearances as successor\"). Confidence (A → B) = P (B | A) = 17/18 = 0.94 = 94% Then, the Lift association rule, obtained through the relation between the Support (A → B) (previously calculated as 0.4146) and the multiplication of the probabilities of occurrence in the hole itemset of A (it occurs 18 times according to Table 3) and B (it occurs 30 times according to Table 3) is calculated. Thus: P (A) = 18 / 41 = 0.439 P (B) = 30 / 41 = 0.7317 Lift (A, B) = [P (A ∪ B) / (P (A) * P (B))] = [0. 4146)/(0.439 * 0.7317)] = 0. 4146 / 0.321 = 1.29 Fig. 3 represents the processes\u2019 network built following the rules presented in Table 4. The numbers displayed within the arrows are the Confidence values between the two processes. The relations are separated by colors, with the red color being the relations with Confidence 1.0, the yellow color being between 0.9 and 1.0, and the blue color between 0.8 and 0.9. Analyzing Fig. 3, according to the Confidence rule from the Apriori algorithm, the arrow points from the antecedent to the successor, indicating the Confidence level that the latter appears in the same article. Thus, for example, in the relationship between P19- Licensing and P2- Government Confidence is 1.0, which means that in 100% of the articles in which the process Licensing is cited, the Government process is also cited. In this network, three from the main stages in the mental map appear as successors to other stages: E7 - Energy codes and standards, connected to nine other stages and being cited in 68.3% of the articles; E2 - Government support, connected to another 15 stages, cited in 73.2% of the articles; and, E10 - Implementation and compliance, connected to 9 stages, cited in 63.4% of the articles. 4.3 Presentation of the actors\u2019 network Table 5 represents the list of actors that make up the regulatory process for the energy sector, in addition to the number of times each was mentioned and the percentage that these citations represent considering 44 articles (Table 2). The actors were coded as A1 to A24. Therefore, Fig. 4 comprises the actors\u2019 network elaborated following the best rules established between the Apriori algorithm described in Table 6 . In the same way as in the previous section, here, relations are established between antecedents and successors using Support, Confidence, and Lift rules. Thus, the interpretation of the actors\u2019 network follows the same reasoning from processes\u2019 network. 5 Discussion Following the mental map, the regulation of the energy sector is composed of seven main processes. These main processes will be presented and discussed in the following subsections. 5.1 Regulatory policy research The first main process from the mental map is \"Regulatory policy research\" and consists of research and development of studies that contribute to policy formulation. This was considered the first process of the mental map once the research is the first step in the development of new policies. Energy saving research and development activities are used to reflect technological progress in energy (Huang, Lai, Wang, & Hao, 2020). Existing regulatory mechanisms are inadequate to promote the development of renewable energies and therefore it is necessary to study the regulation of the electricity market. Research and development is the field that needs the most support for government policy, as with policy advancement and the maturity of the renewable energy market, research is turning to the links between renewable energy, low carbon development, security of energy supply and carbon tax (He, Xu, Pang, Tian, & Wu, 2016). To contemplate a regulatory scenario for EC, research about a cloud-based RE management environment must be carried out. Four other processes derive from this main one: Demand planning, Transition strategies in the use of energy from traditional to energies renováveis (RE), Savings by reducing emissions, and Data on how populations can participate in the development and use of RE. The \"Demand planning\" process, cited in 29.3% of the articles, addresses the issues pertinent to the balance between energy supply and demand and the research and efforts to meet this technical requirement through regulations. The challenge of this process is to encourage the local use of energy generation through load adequacy (Azzopardi & Gabriel-Buenaventura, 2014). Researchers must agree on whether a combination of continuous-based energy (coal or nuclear power plants) and renewable energies are adequate to meet demand, taking into account economic factors, safety and reliability factors, and convince industries and consumers to recognize the advantages (Vincent, Lee, Cha, & Kim, 2021). \"Transition strategies in the use of traditional energy for RE\" process, was abbreviated as S6 and includes studies on the best way to make the transition to a scenario with full use of renewable energies. The energy transition from conventional sources to renewable energy sources is one of the main advances to offset climate change. Therefore, renewable energy policies must become more systematic and nuanced to support the transformative changes triggered by this transition in the energy, social and economic sectors (Mohd Chachuli, Ahmad Ludin, Md Jedi, & Hamid, 2021). Renewable energy boosts growth in high-growth sectors such as the service sector in high-income economies and the manufacturing sector in middle-income economies, so policies are required to drive this transition (Doytch & Narayan, 2021). Furthermore, the transition of RE policies contributed up to seven times to the creation of jobs in the solar photovoltaic industry between 2012 and 2019 and with up to 0.16% in the reduction of carbon emissions from 2012 to 2018 (Mohd Chachuli et al., 2021). The process \"Savings by reducing emissions\" was mentioned in 51.2% of the articles and comprises the efforts to reduce greenhouse gasses and the savings generated from that. For a more effective formulation of energy production policies in reducing greenhouse gasses emissions, governments and researchers need new and more effective approaches, characterized by changes and goals (Armstrong, 2019). The process \"Data on how populations can participate in the development and use of RE\", cited in 31.7% of the articles, details, research, and compilates data on community participation in the development and use of RE, which is necessary for the implementation of effective policies (Okwanya, Alhassan, Migap, & Adeka Sunday, 2020). Considering the two cutoff points for entering the relationship network, percentage of citations and Confidence, both processes did not enter the relationship network because they had a Confidence lower than 0.8. Analyzing the processes\u2019 network, there is a strong relationship between P22 - Demand planning and P1 - Regulatory policy research (Confidence 0.83). This reinforces the idea that for demand planning to take place, regulatory research with this focus must be carried out. In this sense, according to the actor relations network, A19 - Demand Planning precedes (Confidence 0.92) A9 - Consumers/communities together with A6 - Electricity concessionaires (Confidence 0.8). This can be substantiated by the fact that the implementation of demand sharing programs among consumers occurs through the supply of reduced loads, and the concessionaire determines where and when this load should be reduced. This implies that the planning and balance between supply and demand do not work without having a relationship with consumers and concessionaires. P6 - Transition strategies process is linked to P2 - Government support, with Confidence 0.82. During this transition, regulatory tasks are likely to increase to respond to new technologies and demand conditions (Nepal, Menezes, & Jamasb, 2014). Research and development activities provide energy policies to reduce energy intensity, so understanding the drivers of this reduction is of great importance for governments to design targeted energy policies (Huang et al., 2020). Effective policies for incentive schemes should be designed to encourage the population's sense of responsibility to support research and development on the use of renewable energy (Han, Biying, Cudjoe, & Yuan, 2020). Therefore, it is necessary to increase efforts in the formulation of policies that encourage a transition to low carbon energy consumption. This will be extremely useful in contributing to the development of the EC scenario. 5.2 Energy codes and standards The second main process is \"Energy codes and standards\". This process deals with the development of standards that address energy efficiency requirements. For this reason, the \"Planning for civil construction\" process originates here, which aims to consider such requirements. Building energy codes are legal requirements demanded by the government as the minimum acceptable performance level, and standards are recommendations that are not legally binding (Bartlett, Halverson, & Shankle, 2003). Building energy codes are used to enforce a minimum set of building energy efficiency requirements, such as lower environmental impact, lower energy bills, occupant health and comfort, energy resilience, safety, building longevity, among others (O'Brien et al., 2020). Energy efficiency and system optimization are fundamental in the EC scenario (Schaefer et al., 2020), and these standards will describe how the construction of buildings should be done so that energy savings are met. Most developed nations have a section on energy efficiency in their energy planning policies (Pérez-Lombard, Ortiz, Coronel, & Maestre, 2011). For this reason, energy-efficient construction projects are an issue that is increasingly on the agenda (Chan, 2019). To encourage this energy efficiency, carbon taxes can be cited (Zhao, Zuo, Fan, & Zillante, 2011), in addition, a standard that can be used as an example is the lamps with greater energy efficiency (Brown, 2015). Analyzing the network of relationships between processes, there is a strong link between E11 - Planning of civil construction as the antecedent of E7 - Energy codes and standards, with Confidence 1.0, that is, in 100% of the articles in which one was mentioned, the other was also mentioned. Energy codes and standards play an important role in defining the minimum requirements for energy-efficient design and construction, as they describe requirements for new buildings, in addition to renovations (Iwaro & Mwasha, 2010). Energy efficiency associated with the deployment of clean energy technologies can reduce energy generation costs and increase access to safe, affordable and sustainable energy (Al-Homoud & Krarti, 2021). Besides, in the processes\u2019 network, P7 - Energy codes and standards is one of the regulatory processes with the most relationships on the network, with 9 links. The one link with P8 - Monitoring and evaluation as a predecessor has confidence 1.0. This implies that the process of monitoring and evaluating regulations will only be properly carried out if energy standards and codes are well defined and structured. Building energy codes and standards should be developed through energy consumption databases to support assessment policies and improve compliance rates and review existing standards (X. Wang et al., 2019). In the actors\u2019 network, the relation A10 - Energy codes and standards and A7 - Government agency has Confidence 0.88. Therefore, to leverage behavioral changes towards energy efficiency, the government must initiate programs and initiatives, through ambitious goals to increase the capacity of generating clean energy (Al-Homoud & Krarti, 2021). These goals can be translated into codes and standards to contribute to the spread of alternative energy and generation and control technologies. Government has a clear role to play in CE development and regulation, so government involvement in this regulatory process can be beneficial to further the public interest. 5.3 Market-oriented phase Another main regulatory process is the \"Market-oriented phase\". This process encompasses the business environment between sellers and buyers who negotiate energy. This process comprises Bidding, Benchmarking, Network access, and Pricing/rates. The bidding process comprises energy market bidding processes (Cappers, MacDonald, Goldman, & Ma, 2013), transmission and generation bids (He et al., 2016), bids in electricity supply auctions (Frate & Brannstrom, 2017), bidding for the sale of financial incentives to renewable energy producers (Bellantuono, 2017), among others. Benchmarking is the market performance analysis and simulations, for example, the incentives offered by a competitive market in a monopoly environment (Nepal et al., 2014). Benchmarking can be applied to verify the energy consumption of homes and buildings to reduce information asymmetries in the market, increasing the market demand for these buildings (Brown, 2015). These benchmarks in buildings serve to generate reference values that serve to analyze performance indicators. Thus, inefficiency occurs when an entity is unable to achieve the same level of efficiency concerning a benchmark (Boente & Lustosa, 2019). The \"Network access\" process comprises the phase closest to the customer, the moment when the customer receives electricity being connected to the network. Here are the procedures for accessing the distribution network and technical challenges (Martins, Fernandes, & Heldwein, 2020). Improvements in the regulation concerning access to the grid can assist in the spread of renewable energies. This process comprises aspects such as the network's capacity to deal with the quantity and quality of electricity, availability and proximity to access points, and guaranteeing access and cost-sharing between network operators and developers (Lüthi & Prässler, 2011). Considering the bias of the EC, it is necessary to standardize what and how much energy data can be sent to the cloud (Carvalho et al., 2021). Furthermore, in EC, the access to the network contains sensors and actuators connected to the Internet through IoT technologies that allow the collection and transmission of data in real time (Schaefer et al., 2020). To maintain equality among users, it would be important to regulate and standardize the way sensors and IoT devices are used to collect and send data from physical devices to fog servers (Carvalho et al., 2021) The \"Pricing/rates\" process comprises the energy pricing and taxation process and has extensive regulation above that. Well-established regulations at this stage are capable of creating competition between energy utilities. There is an unregulated energy market that needs specific laws (Martins et al., 2020), there are wholesale energy prices (Bilich, Spiller, & Fine, 2019), usage time charges, peak prices, real-time prices, and discounts during peak hours (Annala et al., 2018). For example, requiring a certain percentage of electricity from utilities to come from renewable sources creates competitive prices among technologies that can promote innovation and reduce the cost of renewable energy (Bento, Borello, & Gianfrate, 2020), and this would further contribute to the change to a more conscious and cleaner energy consumption behavior, one of the focuses of EC. In addition, in the EC environment, pricing for cloud services still takes place. Here, there are public or private cloud services for storing energy-related data, where users pay for the system as they use it (Aldossary et al., 2019). The consumer can be presented as the center of the market process, once he dictates the rules of this trade. In this sense, according to the network in Fig. 4, there is a strong relationship of citations is between A9 - Consumers/communities and other actors. This actor has a strong relationship with wholesale and retail. There is no minimum limit to become a free consumer and choose the energy supplier (Martins et al., 2020). The relationship between A9 - Consumers/communities and A14 - Independent regulatory bodies is the only link in the actors\u2019 network that has a Confidence level of 1.0. The independent regulators are highly correlated with the per capita installation capacity (Nagayama, 2010), therefore, this has to do with the purchasing power on the part of consumers and communities regarding the acquisition of sources of renewable energy generation. In addition, an effective regulatory framework involves consumer priorities and interests in the economic regulation of networks (Nepal et al., 2014). The actors A5 - Energy market, A19 \u2013 Retail, and A20 \u2013 Wholesale are antecedents of A7 - Government agency. In this sense, the evaluation of the wholesale market mechanisms and their regulatory structure must be considered to ensure the efficient operation of the network (Nepal et al., 2014). In addition, the authors comment that improving the transparency of the retail market is an important issue, as this would eliminate any abuse of the energy market by dominant companies. In the process network, P3 - Market-oriented phase process did not enter the relationship network because it has no relationship with Confidence greater than 0.8. Understanding the market-oriented phase process, its sub-processes and relationships is essential to contribute to the development of EC, as one of the layers of EC, the Broker, consists of understanding the elements and activities necessary for the commercialization of energy. Broker includes all elements and activities necessary for energy trading and must be connected to users' energy management applications (Schaefer et al., 2020). 5.4 Standard development process Another main process is the \"Standard development process\". This process consists of the development of a standard structure for the creation, monitoring, diffusion, and implementation of energy systems. The EC management model, unlike traditional energy systems, does not have a maintenance standard for regulation. Therefore, understanding this process and the actors involved in this process is the beginning of the concretization of EC. This process comprises Publication of resolutions, Certification, Regular monitoring and evaluation of programs, Licenses: Environmental, location and network connection, and Implementation and compliance (licensing, equipment, and facility approvals). Standards provide a foundation for global commerce, management processes, equipment and systems interoperability, safety, environmental practices and professional qualifications, and provide structure and guidance in rapidly evolving energy efficiency and ER markets (McKane, Daya, & Richards, 2017). The \u201cPublication of resolutions\u201d is the process carried out after regulatory decisions, where the rules are published (Pereira Bastos & de Macedo-Soares, 2011). The \u201cCertification\u201d process can be related to devices and equipment aimed at energy, (Marafao et al., 2018), renewable energy certificates (Armstrong, 2019; Bento et al., 2020), energy efficiency certification (Annala et al., 2018), among others. The \"Regular monitoring and evaluation of programs\" stage comprises the monitoring of the correct functioning of the programs already consolidated. This phase of the regulatory process is important to adapt existing programs if necessary. This includes market monitoring (Maher & Stefan, 2019), capable of assessing market trends and costs (Strupeit, 2017), and the assessment of regular policies (Armstrong, 2019). Conventional regulatory monitoring systems operated by civic bodies are considered reliable but are expensive, complex to use and limited in number (Kaginalkar, Kumar, Gargava, & Niyogi, 2021). In this sense, IoT is emerging as a key component of smart cities and will contribute to regulatory monitoring stations (Kaginalkar et al., 2021) The environmental licensing processes for the generation, transmission, and distribution of energy equipment are part of the \"Environmental, location, and network connection licenses\" process, as well as licenses for the location of such equipment. The environmental performance licenses for buildings can also be mentioned here (Chan, 2019). Here is also inserted the process \"Implementation and compliance (licensing, equipment and facility approvals)\", this includes the process of implementing the regulations and the effort to remain in compliance. Considering these surveys, it is concluded that the standard development process is responsible for maintaining energy security. In this sense, the actor A13 - Electrical Security Agency is related to A16 - Financial, A9 - Consumers/communities, and A7 - Government agency actors, with Confidence of 0.88, 0.94, and 0.88, respectively. This is because the estimate of operating costs determines the electricity tariff, a change in this model can generate an excessive burden for consumers if costs are overestimated, or an excessive burden for regulatory agencies if costs are underestimated, affecting energy efficiency (Boente & Lustosa, 2019). Therefore, it is important to understand the relationship between these three actors to guarantee such efficiency. Thus, electrical security has a strong effect on the financial sector, the government agency, and especially the consumer. Analyzing the processes\u2019 network in Fig. 3, the certification (P28) precedes the processes P2 - Government support and P10 - Implementation and compliance. This is totally in line with the reality considering that the government itself is often the one who certifies the equipment, techniques, and procedures. In addition, when certified, they go into the implementation and monitoring phase to verify compliance. This certification is applied for installers and equipment, network quality certification, or technical requirements (Inderberg, Sæle, Westskog, & Winther, 2020). There is a disconnect between policy makers and standards developers, from the technical level to senior management, and this presents barriers to developing effective and relevant standards (McKane et al., 2017). For the development of EC, it is still necessary to consolidate a regulatory body for this model, so that only later, the standard development process becomes effective and fulfills its function. 5.5 Government support Another main process is \"Government support\", once it deals with regulatory processes related to the government, such as the provision of support funds for the development of renewable energies. This main process is composed of other three processes: \"Legal Sector\", \"Legislative Sector\", and \"Executive Sector\", responsible for defending citizens' rights, drafting and reviewing laws, and enforcement of laws, respectively. Government legislation and regulatory policy have been the main factors driving innovations (O. Smirnova, Strumsky, & Qualls, 2021), and most of these policies emerged as a result of representative democracy, with state legislators enacting policy (Pritchard & Mills, 2021). Here also come the \"State, territorial and national regulators\", considered a process once the regulatory processes go through these three areas, and the use of alternative energy sources is an integral part of the improvement of the national, regional and global economy(E. Smirnova, Kot, Kolpak, & Shestak, 2021). This government support will play an important role in the dissemination of the EC. This is because government support and organizational innovation are the main drivers of any project, and there is a need for greater government support and innovation in the field of renewable energy (Hussain, Xuetong, Maqbool, Hussain, & Shahnawaz, 2022). Analyzing the network of relationships between processes (Fig. 3), Government Support (P2) is the process most linked to other processes (it has 15 links). In this sense, according to the processes\u2019 network, P19 - Licensing and P13 - Administrative process are antecedents of P2 - Government support with Confidence 1.0, that is, they are together in 100% of the articles that cite the three processes. This is justified by the fact that these licenses, whether environmental, location, or network connection depend on administrative processes for their completion. Furthermore, the licensing process is important for issues such as the weight of differences in interests in the process, the influence of stakeholders and the rate of implementation (Gulbrandsen, Inderberg, & Jevnaker, 2021) and obtaining all necessary licenses is the key to an energy developer's business (Lüthi & Prässler, 2011). This licensing process depends on approvals made by an administrative and government support process involved. According to the actors\u2019 network, the A7 - Government agency is one of the main ones in the network and maintains strong links with the other actors mentioned. Downie (2017) comments on government agencies and the energy market, explaining the relationship with the actor A5 - Energy market. The author comments that governments must intervene in the markets because these alone have failed to bring about a fundamental change in the energy system. Still, with a Confidence of 0.83 with the actor A7 - Government agency, researchers (A4) exercise an important role in the energy regulation network. Research in the energy sector makes a major contribution to policymakers (Cox, Royston, & Selby, 2019). The actors A2 - Investors and A5 - Energy market precede A3 - Public regulators with a Confidence of 0.81 and 0.8, respectively. Based on this, the market needs to be designed with new mechanisms, based on capturing the entire structure of renewable costs and which more accurately compensates for conventional technologies (Blazquez, Fuentes-Bracamontes, Bollino, & Nezamuddin, 2018). The authors comment that this is crucial to transmitting the correct market signal to new investors in both technologies. Thus, the government has a clear role to play in this process, such as reducing bureaucratic burdens and regulating rights and obligations (Inderberg et al., 2020). In this scenario, public regulators, who are often responsible for boosting the energy market to investors, are responsible for the midfield. In 90% of the articles that address the actor A7 - Government agency, electricity concessionaires (A6) were also mentioned. In line with the downward trend in the cost of renewable resources with microgrids and other technologies, these concessionaires will face increased competition on several fronts (Martins et al., 2020). Concessionaires must adapt to an era in which new technologies will affect their businesses, as consumers are becoming generators who expect lower electricity bills with less dependence on utility companies (Tolmasquim et al., 2020). Another issue is that energy utilities are moving towards privatization and liberalization (Cox et al., 2019). EC encompasses the concept of independent energy consumers. However, storage, real-time analysis and optimization of a large amount of data are non-trivial tasks for traditional utilities (MA et al., 2018). Therefore, concessionaires may not have sufficient capacity to meet internet-based changes that present greater possibility of control and monitoring across the entire energy system (Dileep, 2020). As a result, concessionaires have been disconnected from government agencies. 5.6 Administrative process \"Administrative process\" is the bureaucratic processes involved in regulation, although these administrative issues are also present in other processes of the regulatory process (Maher & Stefan, 2019). These administrative processes are often time-consuming and this ends up affecting the usefulness of designs and standards (Lüthi & Prässler, 2011). The EC encompasses administrative issues related to energy, given a constantly changing scenario. Therefore, the \"Inspection\" and \"Policy change\" processes enter here. The inspection includes the verification of the conformity of the other processes (Pérez-Lombard et al., 2011). Even if all the necessary information is available, regulations will only be complied with if they are subject to inspections and supervision by competent authorities, and in complex sectors such as energy markets, inspections consume a lot of resources in terms of personnel, funds, technical equipment and time(Bohne, 2011). \"Policy change\" is the policy update process in place. Research on changes in the field of energy efficiency, for example, is scarce. Due to dependence on fossil fuels, opposition to and resistance to major changes in energy policy has been substantial (Bang, 2010), but ensuring access to energy and avoiding high consumer prices are issues that involve all policymakers. A21 - Business actors play a larger role in the competitive segments (generation, retail, and monopoly) (Nepal et al., 2014). This actor is formed by the companies and business associations that represent business interests, and are increasingly prevalent in the network, reaching an almost hegemonic position and having more and more access to decision-making processes within the network (Maggetti, 2019). Policy makers need to consider the importance of the influence of interested companies in the energy regulatory process, as this interferes with the spread of renewable energies and, consequently, with the interconnection of users (Strupeit, 2017). The development of the EC scenario will have a strong influence from other sectors and not only from actors in the energy sector, as is the case with business actors who will influence regulatory decisions, as they will have their financial interests. For this reason, in the actor relations network, A21 appears as the antecedent of A16 - Financial with Confidence 0.95. The financial is what represents the performance of an organization through monetary values, being a consequence of the company's actions and, consequently, of the business actors. The question here will be how to integrate all these actors in order to talk to each other to support the EC model. P27 - Policy change, according to the process network, is the successor of five other processes. Because of this change in current policies, this is a process that depends on several others. The strongest relationship is with E2 - Government support, with Confidence 0.94, which explains the strong dependence of the government in the elaboration and changes of current policies. The speed and ease with which this change will occur will depend on regulatory frameworks, business strategies, and energy practices (Inderberg et al., 2020). The political commitment to radically change energy policy with a focus on less fossil fuels is limited because the concern with energy security alone will not be enough for this change (Bang, 2010). However, there is a technological evolution that clearly points to an energy management in a cloud environment and, therefore, the discussion involving the regulatory evolution of energy is the beginning of the journey towards this scenario of political changes. 5.7 Credit financing/incentives The \"Credit financing/incentives\" process considers tax incentives for the purchase of equipment and installation of energy generation systems. It can be cited the tax reduction incentives offered by the government to promote some new regulations (Chan, 2019) and incentives for energy storage for peak times (Martins et al., 2020). These fiscal and financial incentives are used for the implantation and development of renewable energies (Bento et al., 2020) since in general, investment in renewable energy projects is governed by incentive and limitation policies (Al-Sumaiti, Salama, Konda, & Kavousi-Fard, 2019). In addition, this process also includes \"Investment grants\", which are subsidies or payments for the energy generated, such as policies for feed-in tariffs and carbon taxes (Bento et al., 2020). For the EC environment to be properly implemented, one of the main points to be addressed is the increase of investments in infrastructure (Schaefer et al., 2020), which include the high initial capital requirement, long asset life, inelastic demand by services and prevalence of fixed costs (Bento et al., 2020). These incentive mechanisms encourage investment in renewable energy and the acquisition of cloud-based energy management technologies, and consequently a mindset about conscientious consumption is created, contributing to the spread of EC. The P2 - Government Support process has a relationship with P16 - Investment subsidies with a Confidence level of 0.91. Based on this, a reform of current government policy concerning project financing and implementation is recommended, as this will encourage investors to invest or expand their renewable energy projects (Al-Sumaiti et al., 2019). Countries offer this subsidy to support investments in renewable energy, facilitating the spread of these technologies. This is the case in Oslo, a municipality in Norway, which covered 40% of the investment costs in PV (Inderberg et al., 2020). These government subsidies are important to facilitate the introduction of new technologies and allow the poorest households to be involved in energy regulation and efficiency (Iwaro & Mwasha, 2010). In this sense, according to the actors\u2019 network, A14 - Independent regulatory agencies and A16 - Financial has a relationship with Confidence 0.81. One of the reasons for this relationship may be the fact that independent regulatory agencies minimize the perceived risks of expropriation, and thus play an important role in the decision-making process for private investments (Nagayama, 2010). It can also be cited the example that autonomous regulators have their principles for the implementation of policies, without depending on the preferences of elected politicians who control budgets (Holburn, 2012). In addition, autonomous regulators can hire more qualified personnel, as they are not restricted to already established public salaries. Another strong relationship of actors is between A2 - Investors and A3 - Public regulators with Confidence 0.81. Considering that investments for the propagation of renewable energies are high, in this scenario, support from public regulators is necessary. Therefore, regulating the government's financing strategy for local investment in renewable energy projects is of great importance (Al-Sumaiti et al., 2019). Thus, the incentive on the part of investors contributes to the expansion of energy projects to meet the growing demand for electricity from the population through the reform of the current government policy (Al-Sumaiti et al., 2019). Therefore, considering that EC will be an energy management model that will involve a large amount of information and computing technology, regulations focused on credit financing/incentives are extremely important for the propagation of this innovative environment. 6 Conclusion Understanding how the regulatory environment works by understanding the processes and actors involved in this environment is the beginning of the spread of EC. Therefore, the objective of this article was to identify the processes and actors in the regulation of energy systems, to establish the basic relationships between these actors and processes, outlining the basic guidelines for establishing and/or modifying policies, laws, and regulations regarding the transition of energy systems to the EC. Considering this objective, an SLR made it possible to survey these processes and the actors, and through the application of the Apriori algorithm, it was possible to establish the main relationships between these processes and actors. The contribution of this article is highlighted regarding the approach used based on the association rules of Apriori. When considering the networks of processes and actors only relations with lift greater than 1.0, the results were networks where only direct dependency relations between processes and actors appear and, added to the value of confidence, to make an assessment of their relations intensity is possible. Therefore, the results obtained with the application of Apriori support the SLR and indicate which relationships should really be considered and studied and which occur by mere coincidence in the SLR articles. This research identified that the regulatory processes of energy systems can be classified into 7 basic processes: Regulatory policy research, Energy codes and standards, Market-oriented phase, Standard development process, Government support, Administrative process, Credit financing/incentives. In addition, 21 more processes, totaling 28 regulatory processes were identified (outlined and presented using a mental map), being established a network of dependencies between these processes with 37 direct connections. In the processes relations network, three were established as the main ones in the network: P7 - Energy codes and standards, P2 - Government support, and P10 - Implementation and compliance processes with the highest number of relationships. Regarding the actors, 24 involved in these regulatory processes were identified, and a network with 28 direct and dependent connections between these actors was structured. In the actors\u2019 network, the actors A3 - Public regulators, A16 - Financial, A9 - Consumers/communities, and A7 - Government agency were listed as the main actors. This article has some practical implications for researchers, companies, and energy regulatory bodies: \u2022 The article contributes to the elaboration of a regulatory structure that considers the development and implementation of EC through the adaptation of the regulatory processes scheme presented here. \u2022 The mental map complemented by the process network indicating dependency connections between them can serve as a starting point for the creation of a roadmap that establishes a chronological ordering between the processes, facilitating the development of new legislation and regulations in the sector considering the implementation of the EC. \u2022 The actors network indicates which are the connecting links between the main stakeholders in regulatory processes, enabling a comprehensive view of who has influence in regulatory processes, being able to play a leading role in the roadmap mentioned in the previous item. This article was limited to studying the associations obtained through Apriori between two actors or processes at a time, with associations with 3 or more actors or processes not being mapped and inserted in the networks. This article was also limited to study the regulatory processes considering the evolution of energy systems to EC, since for this it would be necessary to conduct research with specialists to validate this new model. Finally, for future research, it is suggested to develop a framework that considers, in addition to processes and actors, the limiting and hindering aspects related to the scope of EC and that influence regulatory processes. It is also suggested the study and development of diagnostic tools that can assess the development and implementation of the EC regulatory system, considering the entire framework of the regulatory process. In addition, a research tool with experts for validating a new regulatory system is also suggested.

        "dc:description": "Energy Cloud (EC) is the future proposal for energy management but the point is that there is no regulatory framework for EC. Therefore, knowing how the energy regulatory environment works and the relationship between actors and processes in this environment will contribute to the proposition of a new, well-structured regulatory system. The objective of this article is to identify the processes and actors which compose the regulation level of energy systems, to establish the basic relationships between these actors and processes, outlining the guidelines for the establishment and/or modification of policies, laws, and regulations related to the transition of energy management systems to the EC. The method used to achieve the objective was a systematic literature review (SLR) and the Apriori algorithm. SLR identified 7 main processes and 21 secondary processes, totaling 28 regulatory processes (outlined and presented through a mental map), being established through Apriori a network of dependencies between these processes with 37 direct links. 23 actors were identified that are structured in a network with 28 direct and dependent connections. The connections between processes and actors can serve as a starting point for creating a roadmap for the development of new regulations considering the implementation of EC.",
