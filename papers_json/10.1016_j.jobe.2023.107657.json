Demand response (DR) is an effective method for achieving energy flexibility. Preheating can store a certain amount of energy in the building while simultaneously reducing the heat load. The energy flexibility of a building during the heating season mainly depends on the types of DR events, the thermal performance of the building envelope, and weather conditions. Analyzing the impact of these factors on the preheating performance and exploring their interactions can reveal the potential for energy flexibility. This study proposes a simulation-based method to evaluate the energy flexibility of a residential building in Kitakyushu, Japan from the perspectives of energy efficiency, load and energy reduction. Rule-based control strategies are applied to heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems. The results show that compared to preheating temperature of 24 °C, high insulation building at 25 °C achieves energy efficiency improvement of 3.5%\u201314.8% and load reduction increase of 1.6%\u201322.2%. Compared to low insulation building, preheating at 25 °C for 1 h increases energy efficiency in high insulation building by 6.2%\u201310.3%, with corresponding load reduction increase of 1.0%\u201319.1%. Extending the preheating duration improves load reduction but leads to heat loss. Preheating during heating system startup should be avoided as it produces the worst energy flexibility. Moreover, statistical analysis identifies key indicators for energy reduction: the inside surface temperature of the exterior wall (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.820, standard regression coefficient = 0.924), followed by global horizontal radiation and building insulation performance.

The highest energy consumer countries, including China, the United States, Russia and Japan, account for the majority of the global energy consumption [2]. With the ongoing urbanization in developing countries, the global energy consumption of buildings will continue to increase. Therefore, to achieve the goal of net-zero emissions, the building sector needs to move more quickly towards an energy-efficient transformation. To achieve energy transformation, supply\u2013demand balance in the power grid is required [3]. The traditional method of achieving this balance is mainly via the supply side, where the power grid limits the generation rate or integrates backup equipment into the network\u2014a method known as \u201csupply follows demand\u201d [4]. However, as the proportion of renewable energy sources continues to increase, the energy supply from the supply side often comes to depend on uncertain factors such as weather, which require flexibly adjusting energy usage at the demand side [5]. The building equipment adjusts power demand flexibly according to power grid supply or price signals, and this adjustment approach on the demand side is known as demand response (DR) [6,7], which can achieve energy flexibility. The concept of energy-flexible buildings in accordance with IEA EBC Annex 67 [8] has been proposed, which involves adjusting building energy use flexibly to meet building energy demands based on local climate conditions, user needs, and energy network constraints. Energy flexible buildings allow for DR management. DR in buildings can decrease energy demand and enable the buildings to serve as a grid resource for peak shaving and valley filling. DR control strategies include power regulation of building electrical equipment as well as using batteries, thermal storage devices, and building envelope structures for direct or passive energy storage [9\u201311]. The building envelope is an important element that separates indoor and outdoor heat exchange, and its good insulation properties enable energy storage, thus temporarily reducing building load. Therefore, building energy demand can be shifted over time [12]. Currently, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems are commonly used as control devices to store energy in buildings by utilizing the insulation properties of the building envelope, which allows preheating or precooling during nonpeak periods while maintaining indoor thermal comfort [13,14]. This energy storage method is also known as passive thermal storage [15]. It helps not only shift peak power [10,12], but also alleviate the pressure on physical energy storage [16]. 1.2 Quantification of building energy flexibility The potential for building energy flexibility is typically evaluated by quantifying building energy consumption, electricity cost, thermal energy storage efficiency, flexibility duration, and comfort [17,18]. In addition, it is affected by the thermal performance of building envelope structures [19]; local weather conditions, including diurnal and seasonal variations and climatic zone differences [20,21]; and DR events by building occupants, such as HVAC system control, household appliance operation control, and lighting system control [22]. To quantify and compare the potential of using a building envelope to achieve energy flexibility, previous studies have proposed indicators based on the objectives. Energy flexibility indicators makes DR management technologies more specific. However, some studies have only considered a single perspective. For example, Bandera et al. [23] and Bashir et al. [24] quantified the DR ability to consume photovoltaic power but ignored load shifting. Johra et al. [19] and Finck et al. [25] defined real-time electricity prices on the user side and quantified the ability to transfer electricity consumption from peak to off-peak periods by DR. Multiple indicators are needed to measure building energy flexibility comprehensively. Zhang et al. [26] quantified the energy flexibility of heating systems based on indicators such as flexible energy, flexible energy efficiency, and maximum flexible power to minimize energy costs without violating thermal comfort conditions. Zhou et al. [27] quantified the energy flexibility of buildings using renewable energy based on indicators such as renewable electricity surplus period, renewable electricity shortage period, and flexible power. Reynders et al. [28] quantified the energy flexibility of buildings with passive thermal storage according to storage capacity, storage efficiency, and power shifting capability. In summary, multiple quantification indicators allow for a holistic assessment of building energy flexibility from different perspectives. In addition, analyzing the factors affecting energy flexibility is important, which will clarify the energy flexibility potential. The building envelope contributes to energy flexibility, as the energy required by the building can be shifted and shed without jeopardizing indoor comfort. Previous research has focused on the impact of typical buildings on energy flexibility, including the age of the building [29], building type [28], and insulation performance [13,22]. Overall, these studies focused on the thermal performance of the building envelope, such as building thermal mass and building insulation performance. Lu et al. [30] studied the influence of the thermal mass of the envelope structure on building energy flexibility during the cooling season. They found that a larger thermal mass was more helpful for reducing peak loads and improving the energy efficiency of passive energy storage. Wei et al. [31] introduced dynamic electricity prices to evaluate the ability of the exterior wall to shift energy consumption from high-price periods to low-price periods. They found that the lower the thermal conductivity of the exterior wall is, the larger the reduction in electricity costs and the shorter the preheating duration during low-price periods. The outdoor environment affects the indoor load, so buildings require an appropriate DR event for different weather conditions to achieve energy flexibility [32]. In the construction industry, the design of passive houses not only consider good thermal insulation performance, but also make use of heat gain from solar energy. Foteinaki et al. [22] studied detached houses and apartment buildings to regulate the setting temperature of HVAC within the range of human comfort and quantified the increase or decrease in building load during the regulation period. The study demonstrated that energy flexibility is highly correlated with solar radiation and illustrates the importance of the insulation performance of the building envelope. Vivian et al. [29] studied the effect of weather conditions on building energy flexibility and analyzed the relationship among thermal discomfort, passive thermal storage, and energy efficiency during winter and summer. The study demonstrated that a different diurnal distribution of solar radiation in different months of summer leads to a change in energy flexibility, resulting in changes in optimal HVAC control strategy. The control strategies of DR events can be classified into rule-based control (RBC) and model predictive control (MPC). RBC methods commonly involve controlling the HVAC system within the comfort range of occupants, and the control duration can vary from a few seconds to 6 h [29,30,33]. MPC is frequently employed for optimizing control problems, where the optimal control strategy relies on the optimization objective. A common example is the optimal control of indoor appliances to minimize power consumption [34]. Although MPC can achieve optimal energy flexibility, it requires precise and complex predictive models [25,35]. RBC can satisfy certain optimization objectives and offer strong interpretability for quickly determining energy flexibility [36], thus providing a comprehensive comparison of the factors influencing energy flexibility. Although progress in evaluating energy flexibility has been made, some areas require further investigation, particularly in determining the factors influencing energy flexibility. Specifically, the inverse relationship between the U-value and thermal mass, impact of outdoor weather conditions, and the need for a quantitative ranking of influential factors warrants further examination. First, scholars have investigated the impact of the U-value and thermal mass on energy flexibility. However, an inverse relationship exists between the U-value and thermal mass, as variations in the thermal mass may lead to changes in the U-value. Therefore, it is crucial to convert them into singular variables for analysis. Second, outdoor weather conditions crucially affect energy flexibility. Most current studies have analyzed several specific typical days to quickly determine the impact of outdoor weather conditions, but the analysis is not conducive for drawing general conclusions. Finally, a quantitative ranking of the factors that affect energy flexibility is lacking in the literature, making it impossible to identify the key factors affecting energy flexibility. Therefore, to elucidate the potential of building energy flexibility, it is necessary to comprehensively consider the impact of the building envelope, outdoor weather conditions, and DR events and explore their interactions. 1.3 Contributions of this research This work aims to study the application of preheating control strategies in residential buildings to achieve energy flexibility. The energy flexibility indicators are proposed to evaluate the potential of energy flexibility. Meanwhile, the impact of DR events, the thermal performance of the building envelope, and weather conditions on energy flexibility is analyzed, and their interactions are explored. Residential buildings are classified based on the thermal performance of their envelopes. Rule-based control strategies are adopted for DR events, considering the impact of preheating start time and outdoor weather on energy flexibility. Finally, the factors affecting energy reduction are ranked by statistical analysis. The paper makes the following contributions: (1) A simulation-based method is established to evaluate building energy flexibility. Energy flexibility indicators are proposed to quantify energy flexibility from the perspectives of energy efficiency, load and energy reduction. (2) The impact of DR events, thermal performance of building envelopes, and weather conditions on energy flexibility is analyzed. Their interactions are explored to determine the key impact. (3) Statistical analysis is utilized to determine the ranking of the factors affecting energy reduction. A correlation analysis is performed, and the ranking of the factors is then assessed using standard regression coefficients (Beta). The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the methodology of the preheating control strategy and energy flexibility indicators. Section 3 introduces the building information, weather conditions, and simulation model validation. Section 4 presents the case setting that introduces the classification of building cases and the control strategies of DR events. The simulation results and discussion are presented in Section 5. Finally, the conclusions are presented in Section 6. 2 Methodology This section aims to introduce the principle of control strategies and the method for quantification. Fig. 1 illustrates the process of quantifying and analyzing building energy flexibility in this study. Subsection 2.1 introduces preheating control strategies, and subsection 2.2 discusses the indicators for quantifying energy flexibility. 2.1 Control strategy of preheating Energy flexibility refers to the capacity of a building to deviate from its original control strategy after DR is implemented on the user side [37]. HVAC systems are instrumental in achieving energy flexibility in buildings. In winter, good insulation properties of the building envelope are necessary for HVAC systems to be preheated within the comfort range. Maintaining indoor temperatures within the range of 23 ± 2 °C can cover 80% of the thermal comfort zone [38]. Therefore, the indoor setting temperature will be maintained within this range for thermal comfort. In this study, a simulation method based on two types of control strategy cases was used to quantify the energy flexibility of a residential building, as depicted in Fig. 2 . The reference case and the flexibility case were compared, with the HVAC system operating from 08:00 to 00:00 the following day. In the reference case, the setting temperature ( T r e f e r e n c e , t ) of the building was 23 °C, as shown by the black dashed line in Fig. 2. In the flexibility case, a preheating strategy is implemented. Compared to the reference case, the preheating period is from t 0 to t 1 . The setting temperature ( T f l e x i b i l i t y , t ) was 24 °C during the preheating duration ( Δ t 0 ) and 23 °C for the rest of the period. The red solid line denotes the heat load curve of the building under the flexibility case. During the preheating period, the building heat load significantly increased, and the building stored a certain amount of heat. After preheating, the building heat load decreased significantly, and energy shifting was achieved. 2.2 Energy flexibility indicators This study quantifies building energy flexibility from the perspectives of energy efficiency, load and energy reduction. The quantification indicators are based on existing indicators, and new metrics will be developed. Energy efficiency ( η ), average load reduction ratio ( γ \u203e L ), and heat energy reduction ratio ( γ E ) are proposed as indicators to measure the energy flexibility potential. (1) Energy efficiency Δ Q f l e x i b i l i t y denotes the heat added by the heating system to guarantee that the preheating setting temperature is reached during the preheating duration ( Δ t 0 ). The equation is as follows. (1) Δ Q f l e x i b i l i t y = ∫ t 0 t 0 + Δ t 0 ( Q f l e x i b i l i t y , t − Q r e f e r e n c e , t ) d t where Q f l e x i b i l i t y , t indicates the heat load of the building under the flexibility case, Q r e f e r e n c e , t indicates the heat load of the building under the reference case, t 0 is the start time to implement the preheating control strategy, and Δ t 0 is the duration to implement the preheating control strategy. A similar quantitative method can be found in Refs. [13,28]. The heat added during preheating is highly influenced by the type of preheating control strategies [39]. Therefore, this paper sets a variety of Δ t 0 in subsection 4.2 for quantification. The building provides more heat by preheating, then when the setting temperature is adjusted to the same setting temperature as the reference case, the heat provided by preheating will effectively reduce the heat load after the preheating period. Δ Q d e s c e n d compares the heat reduction under the flexibility case to that under the reference case after implementing the preheating control strategy. The equation is as follows. (2) Δ Q d e s c e n d = ∫ 0 ∞ ( Q r e f e r e n c e , t − Q f l e x i b i l i t y , t ) d t + Δ Q f l e x i b i l i t y Some buildings possess good insulation properties that allow the heating system to provide heat by preheating, effectively decreasing the required heat load in the following period. Energy efficiency ( η ) is defined as the contribution of the heat provided by the heating system through preheating to the heat load reduction in the subsequent period. The equation for η is presented below. (3) η = ∑ i N Δ Q d e s c e n d , i ∑ i N Δ Q f l e x i b i l i t y , i where Δ Q f l e x i b i l i t y , i and Δ Q d e s c e n d , i , respectively, represent the heat added and reduced by preheating on a certain day in January, and N is the total number of DR events adopted during the simulation period. This paper evaluates the η of buildings adopting preheating control strategy in January. Because only one DR event is adopted per day, N is set to 31. In some studies, this efficiency is defined as the utilization rate of the heat stored in the building structure by DR, also known as the virtual storage efficiency [28,29]. However, considering that the heat applied to the building does not all come from the heating system, external radiation is also present, so a more accurate description is needed. The indicators in the equation are all from the heating system, so the η proposed in this study aims to quantify the energy flexibility of the heating system, which is defined as the contribution rate of the additional heat provided by preheating to the load reduction, and is not only defined from the perspective of energy loss. (2) Average heat load reduction ratio The heat load reduction ratio ( γ L ) is the ratio of the difference between the heat load of the reference case and the flexibility case at a certain period after preheating to the heat load of the reference case. A similar quantitative method can be found in Ref. [40]. γ L represents the proportion of the heat load reduction at a certain time after preheating and measures the potential load reduction for the HVAC system after flexible control. The equation is as follows. (4) γ L = Q r e f e r e n c e , t − Q f l e x i b i l i t y , t Q r e f e r e n c e , t The simulation period in this study is one month, and the average heat load reduction rate ( γ \u203e L ) is defined to study the comprehensive effect of heat load reduction after applying the preheating control strategy in January. The equation is as follows. (5) γ \u203e L = ∑ i N γ L i N where γ L i represents the heat load reduction after preheating on a particular day. Because one type of preheating control strategy is adopted on a particular day, N is set to 31. To satisfy the grid requirements, preheating is applied for short-term emergency events with a focus on real-time load reduction [41]. γ \u203e L helps in determining the potential for load reduction by observing the change in heat load after preheating. (3) Heat energy reduction ratio Preheating can provide short-term heat load reduction, as discussed in subsection 5.2.1. To quantify the potential for short-term energy flexibility, the heat energy reduction ratio ( γ E ) is developed based on γ L . γ E is defined as the ratio of the energy reduced during a period after preheating to the energy in the reference case. The equation is as follows. (6) γ E = ∫ t 1 t 1 + Δ t 1 Q r e f e r e n c e , t − Q f l e x i b i l i t y , t d t ∫ t 1 t 1 + Δ t 1 Q r e f e r e n c e , t d t where t 1 is the time when preheating ends, and Δ t 1 is the period after preheating. The results in subsection 5.2 reveal that preheating can effectively reduce the heat load within 1 h. To study the impact of DR events at different times on energy flexibility, this study sets Δ t 1 to 1 h. Unlike quantifying the energy reduction capability of peak periods [30]. γ E can be at different times of the day. It will be helpful to quantify the short-term energy flexibility potential under dynamic conditions and analyze the factors influencing energy flexibility. 3 Description of the building model 3.1 Building information A residential building in Kitakyushu was selected as the research object. A physical model of the building was created based on the actual size of the building, and its floor plan is presented in Fig. 3 . The building comprises two floors and has a total area of 129.5 m 2 (excluding the area of the balcony). The first and second floors account for 51.3% and 49.7% of the total area, respectively. Table 1 presents a summary of the building dimensions. Notably, the residential building has good insulation properties. Table 2 lists the detailed thermal performance of the building. 3.2 Weather conditions To assess the influence of weather conditions on energy flexibility, outdoor weather data from Kitakyushu, Japan in January 2020 were analyzed. Fig. 4 illustrates the changes in outdoor air temperature and global horizontal radiation in January, whereas Fig. 5 depicts the variations in relative humidity and wind speed. In January 2020, the average outdoor air temperature was 9.2 °C, with a minimum of 2.8 °C and a maximum of 16.1 °C. During the day, the outdoor air temperature did not vary significantly. The average daily temperature difference from 08:00 to 17:00 was 2.7 °C. The global horizontal radiation, representing the total solar radiation received on a horizontal surface, exhibited a distinct daily pattern of variation. Peaks in radiation intensity were observed around noon, whereas radiation intensity levels were relatively lower in the morning and evening. However, due to predominantly cloudy and rainy weather conditions, the overall global horizontal radiation was relatively weak. Most days witnessed limited solar radiation, resulting in lower energy input from the sun. The average relative humidity was 70%, indicating high air humidity, and the average wind speed was relatively mild at 4.1 m/s. 3.3 Simulation model and validation The simulation was conducted using EnergyPlus, a widely recognized and validated software tool in the field [42]. The physical model of the residential building was created in SketchUp based on the building information presented in subsection 3.1, and simulations were performed using EnergyPlus. The HVAC system for heating was developed in EnergyPlus, which corresponds to the split-type air conditioning used in the residential building. The heated spaces have a total area of 100.5 m 2 and a volume of 284.5 m 3 . The parameters in the system were set according to the Japanese industrial standards JIS B 8615\u20131:2013 [43] and JIS C 9612:2013 [44]. The maximum heating supply air temperature was 40 °C, and the maximum heating supply air humidity ratio was 0.0156. To validate the reliability of the simulation model, simulated and measured data were compared. The indoor temperature and electricity consumption of the building were simulated for January with a time step of 30 min, and the simulated results were compared with the measured results. Fig. 6 shows the comparison results for seven consecutive days. In addition, the coefficient of variation of the root mean square error ( C V ( R M S E ) ) provided by ASHRAE was used to evaluate the accuracy of the model. The equation for C V ( R M S E ) is presented below. (7) C V ( R M S E ) = 1 N ∑ i = 1 N ( X m , i − X s , i ) 2 1 N ∑ i = 1 N X m , i where X m , i and X s , i represent the measured and simulated results, respectively. C V ( R M S E ) of the indoor temperature and electricity consumption during the simulation time (January) were 4.6% and 10.2%, respectively. ASHRAE Guideline 14 states that a model is considered effective when C V ( R M S E ) is less than 15% [45]. Therefore, this model is acceptable for predicting the energy performance and thermal behavior of residential buildings in Kitakyushu. 4 Description of the case setting 4.1 Building cases To study the impact of building envelope thermal performance on energy flexibility, nine distinct buildings were created by modifying the building envelope based on the original model. This research focuses on investigating the impact of two key parameters: the U-value and thermal mass. To systematically analyze the thermal performance, the buildings were initially categorized into three groups based on the thermal mass of their envelope: light, medium, and heavy structures. Within each thermal mass category, further classification was conducted based on the U-value of the exterior wall. This resulted in the classification of buildings into three insulation performance levels: low, medium, and high. The U-value was calculated by setting the heat transfer resistance of the inner surface in contact with indoor air to 0.11 ( k ∙ m 2 ) / w and that of the outer surface in contact with outdoor air to 0.04 ( k ∙ m 2 ) / w . Each of the nine buildings was assigned a unique name to facilitate differentiation and subsequent comparative analysis. The classification approach ensures that buildings within the same thermal mass category share similar thermal mass characteristics. Similarly, buildings with the same insulation performance demonstrate a close resemblance in U-values. Moreover, the absorption and reflection coefficients of the building envelope could affect the building energy flexibility. To achieve control variates, the absorption and reflection coefficients of the building envelopes in all nine buildings are the same. This standardized categorization facilitates a structured and effective comparison among the buildings. A comprehensive overview of the thermal performance of the nine buildings is presented in Table 3 . 4.2 Types of control strategies To investigate the impact of different DR events on energy flexibility, two simulation cases based on RBC were set in this study: a reference case and a flexibility case. In the reference case, the HVAC system was turned on from 08:00 to 00:00 the following day, and the setting temperature was maintained at 23 °C, as listed in Table 4 . The flexibility case was adjusted based on the reference case and divided into two categories. The first flexibility case was designed to study the impact of preheating temperature and preheating duration on energy flexibility. During preheating, the HVAC system setting temperature was 24 °C and 25 °C respectively. The preheating duration ranged from 20 min to 180 min in 20 min intervals. Outside of the preheating period, the HVAC system utilized the setting temperature of the reference case. Table 5 summarizes the control strategies. The second flexibility case was designed to study the impact of the same preheating strategy at different start times within a day on energy flexibility. During the preheating period, the HVAC system setting temperature was 25 °C, and the preheating duration was 60 min. The preheating start time ranges from 08:00 to 16:00 in 60 min intervals. Outside of the preheating period, the HVAC system adopted the setting temperature of the reference case. Table 6 summarizes the control strategies. 5 Results and discussion This section utilizes the energy flexibility indicators proposed in subsection 2.2 for quantification and analysis. Subsections 5.1 and 5.2 analyze the impacts of different types of buildings under DR events from the perspective of energy efficiency and load/energy reduction, respectively. 5.1 Impact of building cases on energy efficiency under DR events According to the control strategy in Table 5, nine buildings were preheated in January at setting temperatures of 24 °C/25 °C and preheating intervals ranging from 20 to 180 min every 20 min; the analysis results of η are shown in Fig. 7 . Further, the preheating control strategy in Table 6 was utilized to analyze energy flexibility by applying preheating for 1 h at 25 °C at different start times. The η value of different building cases was compared, and the results are shown in Fig. 8 . 5.1.1 Impact of control strategies on η For all buildings, η gradually decreased with increasing duration at different preheating setting temperatures, and the rate of this decrease fell as the preheating duration increased. As shown in Fig. 7, compared with the case of preheating for 20 min, a significant decrease in η occurs when preheating is applied for 40 min, after which the rate of this decrease gradually falls, and the difference in η between preheating for 160 min and preheating for 180 min is minimal. This is attributable to the heat loss of the building envelope increasing when the preheating duration is extended. A shorter preheating duration results in lower heat loss, and the energy stored in the building following preheating can effectively reduce the heat load provided by the heating system during the subsequent period. Moreover, as preheat time increases, although the heat loss gradually increases, it tends to stabilize, resulting in a lower rate of decrease in η . The results demonstrate that a preheating setting temperature of 25 °C leads to higher η for the same building, indicating that increasing the setting temperature to the upper comfort limit can improve η . For example, House 3.0 shows a 3.5%\u201314.8% increase in η when preheated to 25 °C compared to 24 °C. In addition, when the setting temperature was 25 °C and the preheating duration was 20 min, the buildings with high insulation performance (House 1.0, House 2.0, and House 3.0) exhibited an η value near 1. Therefore, a higher preheating temperature and shorter preheating duration will contribute to higher η . 5.1.2 Impact of thermal performance of the buildings on η Under the same control strategy, the U-value of the building envelope has a more significant impact on η compared to thermal mass. For buildings under the same category of thermal mass, such as House 3.0, House 3.1, and House 3.2 shown in Fig. 7(c), at the same preheating setting temperature (25 °C), the η of House 3.0 is improved by 6.2%\u201310.3% compared to House 3.2. Meanwhile, buildings with the same insulation performance and different categories of thermal mass exhibit similar η values under the same preheating setting temperature. For example, at 24 °C preheating, the η values for buildings with high insulation performance, namely House 1.0, House 2.0, and House 3.0 were 0.63, 0.64, and 0.63, respectively, when the preheating duration was 180 min. Furthermore, the results were similar for buildings with medium insulation performance (House 1.1, House 2.1, and House 3.1) as well as buildings with low insulation performance (House 1.2, House 2.2, and House 3.2). Therefore, to improve η , the insulation performance of the building should be improved. 5.1.3 Comparison of the impact of control strategies and building thermal performance on η For the same building, preheating at 25 °C can increase the η value. In addition, for all buildings, when the preheating duration was 20 min, 40 min, and 60 min, η was higher when the preheating setting temperature was 25 °C than when it was 24 °C. However, as the preheating duration increased, the advantage of preheating at 25 °C gradually disappeared for buildings with low insulation performance (House 1.2, House 2.2, and House 3.2). Taking House 1.2 with a preheating setting temperature of 25 °C and House 1.0 with a preheating setting temperature of 24 °C as examples, it can be found that House 1.2 preheated at 25 °C produced a higher η when the preheating duration was less than or equal to 60 min. However, as the preheating duration continues to increased, η gradually dropped below that of House 1.0 preheated at 24 °C, and at a preheating duration of 180 min, η was significantly lower than that of House 1.0 preheated at 24 °C. Therefore, the preheating setting temperature has an important effect on η when the preheating duration is short. As the preheating duration increases, the impact of the preheating setting temperature on η gradually weakens; ultimately η becomes mainly dependent on the insulation performance of the building. 5.1.4 Impact of different start times on η for the same control strategy As shown in Fig. 8, preheating at 08:00 results in the worst η for all buildings. This is attributable to the HVAC system starting to operate at 08:00, whereas preheating is used for heating indoor air and building envelopes, resulting in less excess heat. In contrast, preheating at other times leads to a higher η . For buildings with high (House 1.0, House 2.0, and House 3.0) and medium insulation performance (House 1.1, House 2.1, and House 3.1), preheating at 09:00 can achieve the highest η . However, buildings with low insulation performance can achieve a higher η later. Therefore, preheating during HVAC system startup should be avoided to achieve better performance. Buildings with different insulation performances exhibit varying trends in η at different start times, as depicted in Fig. 8. Except for cases when preheating starts at 08:00, the better the insulation performance of the building envelope, the greater the change in η during the day. Taking House 3.2 as an example, when preheating began at 10:00, η was 0.732, whereas it was 0.715 when preheating began at 16:00, representing a decrease in η of 2.3%. η for House 3.1 was 0.768 when preheating started at 09:00, whereas it was 0.746 when preheating started at 16:00, representing a 2.9% decrease. η for House 3.0 was 0.806 when preheating started at 09:00, whereas it was 0.751 when preheating started at 14:00, representing a 6.8% decrease. Therefore, the better the insulation performance of the building, the more significant the effect of start time on η . In addition, buildings with high insulation performance should be selected for preheating at the appropriate time to achieve energy flexibility. 5.2 Impact of building cases on load/energy reduction under DR events Fig. 9 shows the effect of building cases on load reduction under different control strategies in January when the preheating control strategy in Table 5 is adopted. Fig. 9(a) and (b) show the impact of control strategies on γ \u203e L , whereas Fig. 9(c) and (d) illustrate the impact of building thermal performance on γ \u203e L . The energy reduction at different start times based on the control strategies in Table 6 is shown in Fig. 10 . Moreover, the effects of the inside surface temperature of the exterior wall and weather conditions on energy reduction and the ranking of the factors affecting energy reduction are discussed in detail in subsection 5.2.4.2 and subsection 5.2.4.3, respectively. 5.2.1 Impact of control strategies on γ \u203e L Fig. 9(a) indicates that the heat load can be effectively reduced within 1 h after preheating (i.e., before 18:00), and γ \u203e L then gradually levels off. This indicates that preheating operations can provide short-term energy flexibility. As the preheating duration increases, γ \u203e L at each moment also increases. When the preheating duration was 20 min, γ \u203e L at 00:00 the next day was close to 0, indicating that the stored heat in the building had been fully released. However, when the preheating duration was 180 min, γ \u203e L at 00:00 the next day was 0.087, indicating that the heat load can still be reduced when the HVAC is turned off, causing unnecessary energy loss. In addition, a setting temperature of 25 °C is more conducive than that of 24 °C for reducing the heat load. As shown in Fig. 9(b), House 3.0 shows a 1.6%\u201322.2% increase in γ \u203e L when preheated at 25 °C compared to 24 °C. 5.2.2 Impact of thermal performance of the buildings on γ \u203e L Fig. 9(c) shows that for buildings in the same thermal mass category, the better the insulation performance of the building, the better the short-term load reduction effect after preheating. However, as time passes, the difference between the three buildings gradually decreased. Compared with that of House 3.2, γ \u203e L for House 3.0 shows a 1.0%\u201319.1% increase. Fig. 9(d) shows that for buildings with the same insulation performance, such as House 1.0, House 2.0, and House 3.0, γ \u203e L values for the three buildings are almost the same, indicating that the thermal mass of buildings has no significant impact on γ \u203e L . 5.2.3 Comparison of the impact of control strategies and building thermal performance on γ \u203e L Comparing Fig. 9(b) and (c) reveals that the preheating setting temperature has a great impact on short-term energy flexibility. In Fig. 9(b), House 3.0, which has high insulation performance, has a lower γ \u203e L than the low insulation performance building House 3.2 in Fig. 9(c), especially in the initial period after preheating. At 17:10, γ \u203e L of House 3.2 preheated for 1 h at 25 °C and House 3.0 preheated for 1 h at 24 °C were 0.493 and 0.378, respectively, which decreased by 23.3%. Notably, if a building with high insulation performance is preheated at a lower setting temperature, the load reduction effect is not as good as that of a building with low insulation performance preheated at a higher setting temperature. Therefore, the role of the DR event be given more attention. 5.2.4 Impact of different start times on γ E for the same control strategy Subsection 5.2.1 reveals that preheating can provide short-term energy flexibility. Significant reductions in γ \u203e L can be observed within 1 h after preheating. Therefore, this section will focus on the period after preheating when the load is significantly reduced. The energy reduction potential of different buildings at different start times after preheating is shown in Fig. 10, which shows the distribution of γ E at different start times in January for buildings with a preheating duration of 1 h and a setting temperature of 25 °C. The blue dashed line in Fig. 10 represents the average trend. Further, the interior surface temperature of the exterior wall and weather conditions were considered to obtain additional insights into energy reduction, as shown in Figs. 11 and 12 . Finally, a statistical analysis was conducted to rank the factors affecting energy reduction. 5.2.4.1 Impact of the start times According to Fig. 10, the insulation performance, compared to building thermal mass, is a critical factor affecting energy reduction. The higher the thermal insulation performance of the building, the greater the fluctuation of γ E at various start times. Therefore, buildings with high thermal insulation performance are more likely to achieve a higher γ E . The blue dashed line in Fig. 10 reveals that the average γ E trends upward and then downward during the daytime. For buildings with high insulation performance, the highest average γ E occurs when the preheating starts at 12:00. As the insulation performance of the building decreases, the time at which the highest average γ E occurs gradually moves backward. This means that the time when low thermal insulation performance buildings achieve the highest γ E will be postponed. For all buildings, the average γ E is lowest when preheating starts at 08:00. Combined with the result in subsection 5.1.4, η is found to be lowest at this time. The building preheating is insufficient, so the heat added by preheating cannot effectively reduce the subsequent 1 h heat load of the building. Compared with Fig. 8, a higher η does not imply higher γ E . For buildings with high insulation performance (House 1.0, House 2.0, and House 3.0), the highest η can be achieved when preheating starts at 09:00, but the highest γ E can be achieved when preheating starts at 12:00. This is because γ E is strongly influenced by the outdoor weather conditions, as heat gain in the building comes not only from HVAC system but also from solar radiation. The more heat the building stores, the more advantageous is a higher γ E . 5.2.4.2 Impact of inside surface temperature of the exterior wall and weather conditions Inside surface temperature of exterior wall reflects is indicative of the amount of heat stored in the building [46]. Fig. 11(a) shows a strong positive correlation coefficient of 0.804 between the inside surface temperature of the exterior wall and γ E . Buildings with better insulation performance exhibit a greater increase in the inside surface temperature of the exterior wall when preheating, which stores more heat in the building and effectively reduces the heat load in subsequent periods. Furthermore, preheating starting at 12:00 and 13:00 generally results in a higher γ E . Fig. 11(b) illustrates the significant impact of global horizontal radiation, with a strong positive correlation coefficient of 0.666 between global horizontal radiation and γ E , which explains why preheating starting at noon can achieve a higher γ E . In addition, the high insulation building House 3.0 has a higher γ E in the same global horizontal radiation interval. High global horizontal radiation with high insulation performance building is favorable to achieve higher energy reduction. Fig. 12 and the meteorological data in subsection 3.2 reveal the importance of solar radiation. For buildings with heavy structures (House 3.0, House 3.1, and House 3.2), as demonstrated by the example of January 21, the global horizontal radiation changes considerably throughout the day. The impact of adopting the same preheating strategy with different start times on γ E is significant. However, on January 22, when the global horizontal radiation changes only slightly during the day, the effect of adopting the same preheating strategy at different start times on γ E is not noticeable. Even if preheating starts at noon, significantly improving γ E is difficult. In addition, as shown in the red circles in Fig. 12, these points correspond to situations where γ E is very low. All these points belong to House 3.2, in which the preheating time is close to the HVAC system start time. These points correspond to the red circle in Fig. 11(a), and the inside surface temperature of exterior wall corresponding to these points is lower than that for other points, indicating insufficient heat storage in the building. These points also correspond to the red circle area in Fig. 11(b), which implies that the global horizontal radiation is low at this time. To prevent γ E from being too low, the insulation performance of the building should be improved. 5.2.4.3 Statistical analysis Subsection 5.2.4.2 confirms that the impact of weather conditions on γ E is significant. To compare the impact of weather conditions and building thermal performance on energy reduction, a statistical analysis was conducted on the results of subsection 5.2.4.1. As shown in Fig. 13 , the correlation between γ E and weather conditions (global horizontal radiation, outdoor temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed), thermal performance (U-value and thermal mass) of the building envelope (exterior wall, internal wall, and floor), and inside surface temperature of exterior wall were analyzed. Table 7 lists parameters with Pearson correlation coefficient (Pearson's r) above 0.2, with irrelevant parameters removed. The results reveal that γ E is positively correlated with the inside surface temperature of exterior wall, solar radiation, and outdoor temperature but negatively correlated with the U-value of the exterior wall. The degree of influence of different parameters on γ E is determined by evaluating the standard regression coefficient (Beta) in the multiple linear regression model. Beta eliminates the influence of the units of the dependent and independent variables. The absolute value of Beta directly reflects the degree of influence of the independent variable on the dependent variable [47]. Table 8 lists the constructed multiple linear regression model, where Adj. R-Square is 0.879, indicating that the independent variables can explain 87.9% of the variation in the dependent variable. This indicates that 87.9% of the fluctuation in γ E is caused by the independent variables, which means the model has a high level of confidence. Table 9 summarizes the ranking of the degree of influence of the six independent variables. Evidently, the inside surface temperature of the exterior wall, global horizontal radiation, and U-value of the exterior wall play a major role, whereas the influence of the relative humidity is minor. Moreover, the outdoor temperature did not pass the significance test, indicating that it cannot significantly affect γ E . In summary, to achieve energy reduction, it is necessary to ensure that the building stores sufficient heat. This can be effectively achieved by adjusting the setting temperature higher within the range of human comfort and avoiding preheating when starting up the HVAC system. Additionally, solar radiation should be fully utilized. Preheating strategies should be applied when the radiation is high during winter. Finally, the insulation performance of the building should be improved. 6 Conclusions and future work 6.1 Conclusions In this study, a simulation-based method was used to quantify the energy flexibility of residential buildings in the heating month from the perspectives of energy efficiency, load reduction, and energy reduction. First, a residential building model was established, and the accuracy of the building model was validated. To investigate the impact of the thermal performance of the building envelope on energy flexibility, the building envelope was modified in the original model, resulting in nine different buildings. Thereafter, two flexibility strategies were defined based on RBC to explore the impact of different DR events on energy flexibility. Additionally, weather conditions play a significant role in energy reduction. To compare the factors that influence energy reduction, a multiple linear regression model was established. Beta was used to analyze the influence ranking. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) From the perspective of DR events, preheating can achieve short-term energy flexibility during the heating season. Raising the preheating setting temperature to the upper limit of human thermal comfort (25 °C) can provide more energy flexibility for the building. Although longer preheating duration is conducive to reducing heat load, it will reduce energy efficiency and cause heat loss. Further, avoiding preheating during HVAC system startup is recommended as it results in the worst energy flexibility. (2) From the perspective of building thermal performance, improving the insulation performance of the building is more beneficial for achieving a higher energy efficiency, load and energy reduction than the building thermal mass. Moreover, in comparing the impact of DR events and building thermal performance on energy flexibility, buildings with low thermal insulation performance can achieve better energy flexibility when preheated at a higher temperature. Therefore, choosing an appropriate control strategy is crucial. (3) The inside surface temperature of exterior wall can be used as a major indicator for energy reduction, followed by global horizontal radiation and building insulation performance. To achieve energy reduction, it is crucial to ensure that the building stores sufficient heat and fully exploits the weather conditions to preheat the building during periods of high solar radiation. Finally, the insulation performance of the building should be improved. 6.2 Future work Future work will focus on the following areas: First, this study only considered the winter heating season but ignored the cooling scenario, so future work will expand the simulation scenarios to analyze the year-round situation. Second, this study analyzed impact of building thermal performance; However, the impact of envelope absorptivity and reflectivity on energy flexibility is neglected. Consequently, future work will include a wider range of building thermal performance for analysis. Third, the impact of the outdoor environment on energy flexibility was only investigated in one specific region, limiting the generalizability of the results to other climates. To address this limitation, future research will consider multiple climatic regions to obtain more universal conclusions.

        "dc:description": "Demand response (DR) is an effective method for achieving energy flexibility. Preheating can store a certain amount of energy in the building while simultaneously reducing the heat load. The energy flexibility of a building during the heating season mainly depends on the types of DR events, the thermal performance of the building envelope, and weather conditions. Analyzing the impact of these factors on the preheating performance and exploring their interactions can reveal the potential for energy flexibility. This study proposes a simulation-based method to evaluate the energy flexibility of a residential building in Kitakyushu, Japan from the perspectives of energy efficiency, load and energy reduction. Rule-based control strategies are applied to heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems. The results show that compared to preheating temperature of 24 °C, high insulation building at 25 °C achieves energy efficiency improvement of 3.5%\u201314.8% and load reduction increase of 1.6%\u201322.2%. Compared to low insulation building, preheating at 25 °C for 1 h increases energy efficiency in high insulation building by 6.2%\u201310.3%, with corresponding load reduction increase of 1.0%\u201319.1%. Extending the preheating duration improves load reduction but leads to heat loss. Preheating during heating system startup should be avoided as it produces the worst energy flexibility. Moreover, statistical analysis identifies key indicators for energy reduction: the inside surface temperature of the exterior wall (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.820, standard regression coefficient = 0.924), followed by global horizontal radiation and building insulation performance.",
