(1) User management module: The basic module of the mobile app and data management system, it is mainly used for registration, login and the initialization. It is necessary to update the basic information of the user, including gender, height, weight and location information, as these are the determinants of the individual thermal sensation. Only after users log in and initialize their basic information can they use the other functions. (2) Bluetooth scanning and binding module: In the human body data collection link, the data collected by the smart bracelet needs to be received by Bluetooth technology, so this module is specifically subdivided into Bluetooth scanning and binding. The list of Bluetooth signals is updated within a scanning cycle, and the user selects which Bluetooth device to bind to for data transmission. (3) Minute data processing module: This module can realize the minute data transmitted by the Bluetooth module, display it on the application interface and synchronously upload it to the cloud server for unified management. The app interactive interface has the effect of a progress bar display, which makes it convenient and intuitive to feel the current synchronous progress. (4) Indoor temperature setting module: This module enables the user to set the air conditioning temperature directly, so that the thermostat can realize traditional temperature set value control. The user submits the corresponding temperature setting value through the drop-down list in the application interface and uploads it to the server database. (5) Comfort survey module: As a form of control based on thermal artificial feedback, this module investigates the user's current thermal/humidity sensation, and the feedback values divide dry to humid and cold to hot into seven levels. The feedback data contributes to calculate the optimal temperature set point and improve the indoor thermal environment. Users vote in the drop-down list in the app interface and upload the voting results to the server database. (6) Environmental satisfaction survey module: This module investigates user satisfaction with the current thermal environment and divides satisfaction ratings into seven levels from very dissatisfied to very satisfied. The user satisfaction survey can give us a basis for upgrading and optimizing the calculation method in the future. Users select the corresponding satisfaction level through the drop-down list in the app interface and upload the satisfaction evaluation results to the server database.

School of Energy and Power Engineering Changsha University of Science and Technology Changsha 410114 China In engineering practice, air conditioning systems are not regulated according to the accurate real-time thermal sensation of occupants, which not only hinders improving the thermal comfort of the indoor environment but also wastes the energy of air conditioning systems. To introduce human thermal comfort in real-time into the intelligent control of air conditioning systems, this paper develops a mobile app and data management system for the intelligent control of the indoor thermal environment with three key components: the phone app, server and database. Function tests of the six modules are carried out to verify the stability and usability of system. A comparative experiment between wearable sensing of thermal sensation control based on this system and traditional temperature set value control under summer conditions is then conducted to verify the feasibility of the system. Under wearable sensing of thermal sensation control, the average indoor temperature setting value is 27.5 °C with an average satisfaction score of 5.50, which is higher than the average indoor temperature setting values of 26.3 °C and average satisfaction score of 4.65 under traditional temperature set point-based control. It means that the subject's thermal preference is met while achieving energy savings. The system proposed herein offers a new way to solve the problem of the disconnection between the intelligent control of air conditioning and the actual thermal sensation of occupants.

The indoor thermal environment not only affects the thermal comfort and physical health of its occupants, but also directly influences building energy consumption [2]. As an important part of the building thermal environment, the air conditioning systems occupy 30%\u201355% energy consumption of a building [3]. In engineering practice, the indoor temperature is usually regulated at a predetermined set point by a thermostat mounted on the wall or near the door. Although this method is easy to implement, the accurate real-time thermal sensation of the occupants is not accounted for in the air conditioning automatic control system because the thermostat is located far from the working personnel. In other words, there is a disconnect between the air conditioning automatic control system and the actual thermal sensation of the occupants. This is not only detrimental to further improving the indoor thermal comfort of air conditioning, but also hinders the energy saving and emission reduction of buildings. Researchers have made many attempts to solve the above problems. HMI (Human Machine Interface) [4,5], cell phone apps [6\u20138] and online feedback tools on computers [9] were used to collect user thermal comfort and guide air conditioning system operation, and the results showed that these methods could obtain better environmental thermal comfort and air conditioning energy efficiency. Model-free control methods based on user thermal sensation feedback information have little impact on thermal comfort, but high energy-saving potential [10]. Some researchers introduced user thermal preferences into the control method of HVAC systems to achieve personalized intelligent control [11\u201314]. The thermal comfort model control method of infrared thermography can obtain higher thermal comfort without interfering with the normal work and life of the users [15,16]. However, infrared thermography becomes less accurate when it is away from people or under low light intensity. A wristband that simultaneously monitors skin temperature from the wrist and the fingertip was used to estimate subjective thermal sensation [17]. Lab-grade wearable devices were also used to develop personal thermal comfort models for normal daily activities [18]. Wearable devices represented by smart bracelets integrate high-precision sensors into a portable device that can sense, collect and upload physiological data in a 24/7 manner without interfering with normal life, and these real-time physiological data can be used to adjust indoor environments to enhance people's lives [19]. From 2013 to 2020, the smart bracelet transformed from being fresh on the market to almost all mainstream smartphone companies on the market offering their own smart bracelet products. Current mainstream smart bracelet products are shown in Table 1 . Most of these popular smart bracelets feature heart rate monitoring, motion recording, intelligent reminders and GPS positioning. Widely used in various fields, smart bracelet technology is maturing. Smart sports bracelets help to measure a driver's alertness level by monitoring their action of turning the steering wheel [20]. A wearable smart bracelet equipped with an ultra-low power camera and a microphone has been designed to achieve self-sustainability using solar cells that only require modest indoor light levels and a thermoelectric generator (TEGs) that only requires small temperature gradients from body heat [21]. The physiological data of students collected by the smart bracelet was analyzed and then modeled by machine to obtain a healthy system for assessing physical fitness and cardiopulmonary health [22]. The wearable bracelet could help patients track their physical data easily and promote a healthier and more positive lifestyle [23,24]. A danger alarm intelligent system model which combines monitoring and first aid through the smart bracelet can realize intelligent alarm and cloud medical first aid dispatch [25]. A wearable bracelet that can be used as a temperature monitoring and trajectory analysis system can also detect the direct and indirect contact of the wearer in any period of time, which is very helpful for the prevention and control of infectious diseases and the isolation of potentially infected persons [26]. A fitness management system based on the smart bracelet realizes the automation of functions such as fitness monitoring, data recording and analysis and training plan-making to provide references for athletes' fitness training [27]. The reliability and effectiveness of the smart bracelet in measuring heart rates in the laboratory and physical education have been verified [28]. The smart bracelet can even effectively identify human emotions by analyzing the heart rate signal [29]. As the basis for the further development of a novel regulation approach for heating/cooling systems in buildings, the smart bracelet has been applied to the monitoring of personal thermal comfort [30], but there are few reports on their use in air conditioning automatic control systems. The main reason why smart bracelets are not widely used in air conditioning intelligent control is because most of them can only upload the monitored data to their own mobile app database through Bluetooth. Furthermore, different kinds of Bluetooth communication protocols for smart bracelets are provided by brands, and most bracelet developers skip this step. This phenomenon leads to great limitations in the secondary development and application of smart bracelets in other fields. As such, it is difficult to achieve an automatic air conditioning control system based on the thermal sensing of physiological parameters such as human wrist skin temperature and heart rate, which uses the existing smart bracelet to directly communicate with the air conditioning thermostat. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a link between the intelligent control of air conditioning and the actual thermal sensation of the occupants. This paper attempts to develop a mobile app and data management system for room temperature control in order to solve the above problems. It is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the design and implementation process of the three key parts of the system, namely the app, server and database; Section 3 tests six modules of the system and shows the results of the test cases; Section 4 verifies the feasibility of a mobile app and data management system for the intelligent control of indoor thermal environments through experiments; Section 5 presents the discussion of the paper; and the final section draws the conclusion. 2 System design and development It was decided that the mobile app for room temperature control would be developed by Android technology, the back-end service would be built using the SpringBoot framework, and unified data management would be realized by integrating the MyBatis persistence layer framework and Jetty container. SpringBoot is a server application framework that uses JavaConfig annotations for configuration, which greatly reduces the complexity of integrating different components in the development process and makes it easier to build server applications [31,32]. MyBatis, a widely used persistence framework developed by Java, supports dynamic SQL queries and facilitates users to encapsulate persistence layers that meet their own needs [33]. Jetty is one of the most widely used webserver/servlet containers in the world. It has a simple software architecture in which components can be loaded on demand to reduce unnecessary component loading and server operating costs. Besides, the data obtained by the mobile app is transmitted in JSON format through the HTTP protocol. This data exchange format is not only readable, but also easily parsed and generated by the machine, which can greatly improve the transmission speed of the network [34]. 2.1 App construction The mobile app and data management system for the intelligent control of the indoor thermal environment determines the division of the main functional modules of the system in such as aspects as overall system function, input and output, technology, ease of use, operating environment and other conditions. Module function represents the realization effect of the whole application function and data management system. The mobile app, as the core part of connecting the functions of the whole system, should have clear boundaries, low correlation and clear hierarchical relationships between modules. As shown in Fig. 1 , the app can be divided into the user management module, Bluetooth scanning and binding module, minute data management module (including wrist skin temperature, heart rate and other data collected by the smart bracelet), indoor temperature setting module, comfort survey module and environmental satisfaction survey module. Together, these modules complete the overall structure and function of the system. 2.2 Server construction The main functions of the server include obtaining physiological data collected by the mobile app; providing a series of callable interfaces; and managing physiological parameters such as wrist skin temperature, heart rate, temperature set point and thermal feedback. The server also stores the data in the database which is called by the controller query. In this paper, the interface is designed according to the Representational State Transfer (REST) interface specification. The authority verification of the calling interface is also carried out to ensure the security of the exposed interface. (1) Interface design The REST specification is a design style and development method for network applications. Its specified interface is based on the HTTP protocol and it can use XML or JSON to define data formats. In the REST specification, everything on the network is abstracted as resources, all operations on resources are stateless, and the browser creates, retrieves, updates and deletes (CRUD) the specified resource through four requests including requesting a specific resource (POST), requesting to delete the identified resource (DELETE), uploading the latest content to the specified resource location (PUT) and submitting a data processing request to the specified resource (GET) [35,36]. Therefore, the unified interface of system resources is expressed in the four dimensions of resource name, path, request method and request parameter, as shown in Table 2 . The return value of the server interface is JSON format data, which is divided into response status (code), success flag (success), interface return data (ret) and error message (errmsg) [37]. The specific format is shown in Table 3 . (2) Interface development The interface of the server is divided into the user interface, location interface, data upload interface and data query interface. The main objects involved in interface implementation are Controller (handles requests sent by the front end), Service (defines the interface), ServiceImpl (implements the interface function) and Mapper (queries the database) (see Fig. 2). The functions of the user interface include registration (/user/register), login (/user/login), getting user information (/user/findUserInfo) and updating user information (/user/updateUserInfo). Fig. 3 shows the time sequence diagram of user registration and login. When registering, UserController calls UserServiceImpl to check whether there is a duplicate user ID, and returns an error directly if there is. Otherwise, user registration is carried out and the user ID and password are stored on the database through UserMapper. When logging in, UserServiceImpl calls UserMapper to query user information based on username and password. Login is successful if the information can be matched. Otherwise, the user ID or password error is returned. Similar to Fig. 3, the updateUserInfo and findUserInfo methods in UserServiceImpl are called by UserController to get and update user information respectively. Building location information (/getFirstLocation) and room location information (/getSecondLocation) are obtained through the location interface. The time sequence diagram of location setting is shown in Fig. 4 . The database building and room tables of the location information are both obtained by LocationController calling LocationServiceImpl. The data upload interface is mainly used to upload human skin temperature and heart rate data (/upload/minuteData), temperature setting data (/upload/Tempset) and comfort survey data (/upload/vote). The data upload timing is shown in Fig. 5 . The upload interface of human minute data is defined in the uploadMinute method of UploadController. This method calls uploadMinuteData of UploadServiceImpl to complete the conversion from MinuteData to MinuteDataEntity, and saves it to the database by calling insertMinuteData of UploadMapper. The comfort survey data upload interface is defined in the uploadVotes method, and the data is inserted into the corresponding database table by UploadMapper. The data query interface mainly includes the interface of human minute data query (/download/minuteData) and comfort survey data query (/download/vote). The time sequence diagram of data query is shown in Fig. 6 . The downloadMinuteData method of DownloadController, which is responsible for handling minute data query requests, calls the findMinuteDataByDate method of the service layer. The data is finally queried from the table by calling DownloadMapper, mapped by the MyBatis framework and stored as a solid class object of human minute data called MinuteDataEntity. The downloadVotes method of the DownloadController class, which handles query requests for comfort survey data, queries the data from the table by calling DownloadMapper with two time parameters simultaneously, and the result is mapped to a list of RespVote objects representing comfort survey data. The server interface can only be called by the internal users and air conditioning system controller. Uploading illegal data through maliciously tuned interfaces will cause the system to run abnormally. Therefore, requests that do not pass validation will prohibit getting information. The server intercepts verification using SpringMVC [38], the verification method of which is based on the JWT (JSON Web Token) internal interceptor [39]. SpringMVC (Interceptor) can realize log recording, permission verification, performance monitoring and several other common behaviors. 2.3 Database construction The function of the database is to unify the human physiological data and the data submitted by users through the mobile app for the thermostat to query and call. As shown in Fig. 7 , the entity-relationship (E-R) diagram of the database reflects the interrelationship between the entities including building, room, user minute data, indoor temperature setting, environmental satisfaction and comfort survey. This system uses the data table to achieve data saving. The data table includes the user information table, building name table, regional location table, minute data table, room temperature setting table, thermal/humidity sensory feedback table, and thermal environment satisfaction evaluation table. These data tables show the relationships between entities and together constitute the database structure of the mobile app and data management system for room temperature control. The user information table is used to record users' detailed information including number, account number, password, age, gender, height and weight, as shown in Table 4 . The building name table and regional location table document the building name and number (primary address), and regional location (secondary address) in the building of the users respectively, which constitutes the current location of users. Furthermore, a tally of skin temperature, heart rate, acquisition time and update time data is kept in the minute data table. User-completed data including the room temperature setting value, thermal/humidity sensation votes and thermal environment satisfaction survey are correspondingly logged in the tables of room temperature setting, thermal/humidity sensation feedback and thermal environment satisfaction evaluation respectively, as listed in Appendix A. 3 System performance test As a crucial part of the life cycle of software development, testing is an important means to ensure the quality and reliability of the system, and also to discover many hidden defects [40]. It keeps the system running smoothly with the functional modules determined by the requirements. 3.1 User management module The user management module includes user registration, login and basic information settings. When a new user registers, they need to enter their name and password twice, and the server will check the uniqueness of the user ID. In the login link, the system compares the entered user name and password with the database. After the user's login is successful, their basic information including age, height, weight, gender, building name (first-level location) and room number (second-level location) needs to be set. The Android front-end application will call the user/updateInfo interface for data upload and save the data to the database. The related test cases are shown in Table 5 . 3.2 Bluetooth scanning and binding module In the Bluetooth binding interface, the device ID and signal strength of the smart bracelet in its broadcast state can be displayed on the interface. The corresponding device ID can be clicked to connect and transmit data using the device. Users can also skip this step while still using the other features of the app. 3.3 Minute data processing module Minute data processing is mainly divided into data reception, display and synchronization. The mobile app synchronizes with the smart bracelet through the REST interface, transmits the data to the server in JSON format, and saves it to the database. At the same time, the app interface refreshes the current synchronization progress percentage and skin temperature and heart rate values in real-time to facilitate users in checking information. 3.4 Comfort survey and satisfaction survey modules In the app interactive interface, users can choose the corresponding indoor temperature setting value, thermal sensation level, humidity sensation level and thermal environment satisfaction. The testing of this module includes the display of voting drop-down list options, upload of voting feedback and test cases of voting data query. 3.5 Performance test The simultaneous synchronization of the physiological data of multiple users requires the system to have sufficient load capacity. The load performance test includes the interface response time test and interface pressure test. 3.6 Safety test As an important part of application design, the security testing of the system mainly includes user password ciphertext storage and interface permission verification. The physiological data belongs to the personal privacy of users, so the login password needs to be encrypted storage. In addition, the user's identity needs to be verified before the upload of data. If malicious illegal data were to flow into the database, it would seriously affect the normal operation of the air conditioning control system. The test cases and results for the last five modules are listed in Appendix B, and all of the test cases achieved the expected results. 4 System application results To verify the feasibility of the mobile app and data management system for intelligent control of indoor thermal environment, a comparative experiment between wearable sensing of thermal sensation control and temperature set-value control was carried out. Control performance and personnel satisfaction were then compared and analyzed. 4.1 Experimental objectives and test bench The experiment was conducted in late August 2020 for nine days in Office No. 1 of the Dalian University of Technology's multi-area dual-fan variable volume air conditioning system integrated control test bench. The building information model diagram of the test system is shown in Fig. 8 . Twelve healthy subjects (5 females and 7 males aged 24 ± 1.63 years with body mass index BMI 20.57 ± 1.52 kg/m2) were required to participate in the test for at least two days without knowing which control method was actually being used, thereby ensuring that the two different control methods would be compared objectively. Under temperature set-value control, the temperature setting value was submitted by the subject through the mobile app interface. The weighted average was used as the temperature setting value when more than one subject submitted their expected temperature. Under wearable sensing of thermal sensation control, the optimized indoor temperature setting value can be obtained by the following steps. (1) The individual thermal sensation: In our previous work [41], linear regression calculation of physiological parameters (skin temperature, heart rate) monitored by the smart bracelets allows for obtaining individual thermal sensation. The linear regression model can be expressed as (1) T S = a + b T wsk + c D wsk + d H R Wherein T S represents the predicted thermal sensation, T wsk indicates the wrist skin temperature, D wsk indicates the time differential of the wrist skin temperature, H R describes the heart rate, while the constants (a, b, c, d) denote the regression coefficients of the estimation model. (2) After we obtain the individual thermal sensation of the person, we can further calculate the group thermal sensation (GTS), which is a composite representation of the individual thermal sensation of all people in a control area and can characterize the feelings of the group in the area. The group thermal sensation fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method can be used to obtain the GTS [42]. (3) The optimized indoor temperature setting value can be determined by GTS. If the GTS ranged from −0.5 to 0.5, the room temperature setting value is not adjusted; otherwise, the room temperature setting value adjustment is calculated by using the fuzzy control method [43]. (2) t SO = { t S + Δ t G T S < − 0.5 or G T S > 0.5 t S − 0.5 ≤ G T S ≤ 0.5 (3) Δ t = fuzzy ( G T S e , G T S ec ) Where, t SO indicates the optimized temperature setting value, °C; t s represents the temperature setting value before optimization, °C; G T S is the calculated value of group thermal sensation; G T S e describes the deviation between the calculated value of group thermal sensation and the optimal value; and G T S e c represents the variation of the group thermal sensing deviation between the current and the previous moment. To eliminate the influence of other parameters on the test results, in addition to the same operation strategies, the initial room temperature was set at 25 °C, the indoor CO2 concentration was controlled below 800 ppm, the relative humidity was between 40% and 65%, and the airflow rate was controlled below 0.2 m/s. Furthermore, the variable air volume terminal adopted the Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control algorithm based on the room temperature set point and actual indoor temperature in order to maintain the indoor temperature within the robust region of ±0.3 °C. At the same time, the 30-min interval for changing the temperature set point ignored the system's room temperature lag characteristics and the thermal response characteristics of the building. Environmental parameters such as CO2 concentration and indoor/outdoor temperature and humidity were recorded every 1 min. And the measuring range and accuracy of the sensors are listed in Table 6 . 4.2 Experimental procedure As shown in Fig. 9 , the experiment lasted from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. every day, with a 2-h break at noon. During the experiment, all subjects wore short-sleeved jackets and pants as they worked and walked around the environment as though they were in a normal working office. Physiological parameters such as wrist skin temperature and heart rate were monitored in real-time by smart bracelets. Furthermore, the subjects were required to submit a satisfaction vote on the mobile app every 30 min to record their satisfaction with the thermal environment (see Fig. 10). 4.3 Experimental results Two sample days with similar outdoor weather conditions were selected to analyze the two control methods. The average values of outdoor air temperature and relative humidity were 30.5 °C and 78.5% respectively under temperature set-value control, and 30.6 °C and 77.2% under wearable sensing of thermal sensation control, but this difference in outdoor conditions was not significant, so the experimental results of these two days were used for comparison. Figs. 11 and 12 show the indoor air temperature, outdoor air temperature and set value of indoor temperature under the two control methods. As shown in Fig. 11, the upper and lower bounds of the setting value were changed several times, indicating that the thermostat adjusted the temperature setting value in a timely manner according to the thermal sensation of the subjects under wearable sensing of thermal sensation control. However, under temperature set point-based control, the temperature setting value was actively adjusted only when the subjects were uncomfortable, resulting in excessively cold indoor temperatures and excessive energy use of air conditioning system at certain times. Under wearable sensing of thermal sensation control, the range of indoor temperature setting values was 25.0\u201327.8 °C with a mean value of 27.5 °C, while under temperature set-value control, the range of indoor temperature setting values was 25.0\u201327.0 °C with an average value of 26.3 °C. Obviously, the higher indoor temperature under wearable sensing of thermal sensation control meant that it has a certain energy-saving potential. Fig. 13 demonstrates the average satisfaction scores of each subject for the day under the two control methods. There are seven levels of satisfaction: very unsatisfied (1), unsatisfied (2), slightly unsatisfied (3), neutral (4), slightly satisfied (5), satisfied (6) and very satisfied (7). The average satisfaction scores under wearable sensing of thermal sensation control for subjects were higher, which meant that all subjects felt more satisfied when the room temperature was adjusted to the occupants\u2019 thermal sensation. The average satisfaction score of the subjects under wearable sensing of thermal sensation control (5.50) was higher than that under temperature set-value control (4.65). These results also suggest that the wearable sensing of thermal sensation control method is superior to the temperature set point-based control method as far as occupant thermal comfort is concerned. 5 Discussion Extremely low indoor temperatures and excessive energy consumption can occur under temperature set-value control due to the difficulty of determining a comfortable indoor temperature setpoint. However, the mobile app and data management system for the intelligent control of the indoor thermal environment is capable of introducing the occupants' actual thermal sensation monitored by smart bracelets into the intelligent control of the air-conditioning system, resulting in a more reasonable indoor temperature setting value. Moreover, the average indoor temperature setting value and average satisfaction score were higher under wearable sensing of thermal sensation control compared to temperature setpoint-based control, suggesting significant energy-saving potential and a higher comfort level. In contrast to obtaining real-time physiological data from the occupants using smart bracelets in order to predict their thermal sensation, previous studies [4\u201310] implemented air conditioning control based on thermal sensation through active real-time recording upload by occupants, which meant disturbing their regular work. Deng et al. [44] improved the air conditioning system by using wristbands that monitored human physiological data including skin temperature, relative skin humidity and heart rate, thereby reducing heating and cooling loads by 90% and 30% respectively. However, the study only recorded the occupants' thermal perception without evaluating their satisfaction with the indoor environment, so this approach could not represent an improvement in the human thermal comfort level. The intelligent control of indoor environments can be also carried out in terms of lighting, air quality and other aspects. Furthermore, the intelligent control of the indoor thermal environment can aid in the modernization of human life. It can also help to achieve the peak carbon and carbon neutrality goals, and contribute to solving the problem of climate change. 6 Conclusion In response to the problem that air conditioning systems do not adjust the room temperature in a timely manner according to the exact thermal sensation of the occupants, this study developed and tested a mobile app and data management system for room temperature intelligent control. It then carried out a comparative experiment between wearable sensing of thermal sensation control and temperature set-value control to demonstrate the feasibility of the system. The conclusions are as follows: the air conditioning system cannot be adjusted according to the accurate real-time thermal sensation of the occupants. (1) The mobile app and data management system for room temperature intelligent control, realized by Android technology, SpringBoot framework, MyBatis persistence layer framework and Jetty container, passed all tests successfully and can provide technical support for human thermal sensation prediction and room temperature intelligent control based on wearable sensing devices. (2) With the mobile app and data management system receiving real-time personnel feedback and monitoring data from the smart bracelet, the average indoor temperature setting value is 27.5 °C with an average satisfaction score of 5.50 under wearable sensing of thermal sensation control, which is higher than the average indoor temperature setting values of 26.3 °C and average satisfaction score of 4.65 under traditional temperature set-value control. Therefore, the air conditioning system can realize intelligent control based on thermal sensation, enhancing indoor environmental satisfaction and raising the indoor temperature in the summer. However, there are also a few limitations. A large sample size could lead to the sufficient accuracy of experimental data [45]. Due to the limitations of laboratory size and experimental time, only twelve subjects were asked to participate in the experiment. Despite the small sample size and the small experimental data, the results of this study are statistically feasible and meaningful. In addition, air conditioning only operates in summer conditions, so this study cannot represent the results under winter conditions or throughout the whole year. A more specific and convincing energy consumption analysis could make the advantages of the mobile app and data management system for the intelligent control of the indoor thermal environment more prominent. Meanwhile, there are still many people who are not equipped with smart bracelets. We will attempt to use the wearable device and infrared thermography together to monitor human physiological data and improve the accuracy of monitoring individuals\u2019 parameters in our future work.

        "dc:description": "In engineering practice, air conditioning systems are not regulated according to the accurate real-time thermal sensation of occupants, which not only hinders improving the thermal comfort of the indoor environment but also wastes the energy of air conditioning systems. To introduce human thermal comfort in real-time into the intelligent control of air conditioning systems, this paper develops a mobile app and data management system for the intelligent control of the indoor thermal environment with three key components: the phone app, server and database. Function tests of the six modules are carried out to verify the stability and usability of system. A comparative experiment between wearable sensing of thermal sensation control based on this system and traditional temperature set value control under summer conditions is then conducted to verify the feasibility of the system. Under wearable sensing of thermal sensation control, the average indoor temperature setting value is 27.5 °C with an average satisfaction score of 5.50, which is higher than the average indoor temperature setting values of 26.3 °C and average satisfaction score of 4.65 under traditional temperature set point-based control. It means that the subject's thermal preference is met while achieving energy savings. The system proposed herein offers a new way to solve the problem of the disconnection between the intelligent control of air conditioning and the actual thermal sensation of occupants.",
