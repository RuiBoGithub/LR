The control strategies can be classified into five modes: (A) always-on mode that maintains the temperature setpoint at a comfortable level irrespective of the occupancy status; (B) programmable mode that follows a pre-defined weekly schedule based on the expected occupancy level without considering the real-time occupancy status; (C) occupancy mode that sets the temperature setpoint based on the real-time occupancy sensing data; (D) complex mode that incorporates features such as zone-independent control, occupancy learning, and smart start; and (E) the usage of the smart thermostat was left to the discretion of the residents. 2. There are two distinct categories of energy savings: direct and indirect. Direct energy savings rely on metering or sub-metering data to determine energy consumption. On the other hand, indirect energy savings rely on estimations based on the reduction in HVAC equipment runtime or valve openness ratio during operation.

Turner Department of Construction Management Louisiana State University Baton Rouge LA 70803 United States While many simulation-based studies have demonstrated the energy-saving potential of occupancy-driven smart thermostats in residential buildings, field testing of these devices remains relatively limited. The objective of this study is to propose a new field-testing approach to evaluate the heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) energy-saving potential of occupancy-driven thermostats and occupancy-centric controls (OCC) for HVAC in a residential apartment in Texas, U.S. A proprietary prototype occupancy sensing system was chosen for this study, coupled with a Raspberry Pi-based hardware framework to facilitate OCC implementation by linking occupancy sensors to the existing HVAC system. Energy consumption of the HVAC system during both non-OCC baseline and OCC modes was measured using various sensors installed at the test site. Furthermore, XGBoost models were developed, used onsite measurements, to consider the effects of various factors like occupancy and outdoor weather conditions on HVAC energy consumption to facilitate a fair comparison. The scope of the analysis was further expanded to cover the period from 2018 to 2022 and Typical Meteorological Year 3 (TMY3) by incorporating a statistical occupancy schedule generator. The results suggest that approximately 15.1% cooling energy consumption could be saved during the testing period, equivalent to around 109 kWh in electricity savings. Moreover, OCCs have the potential to achieve electricity savings ranging from 300 to 330 kWh in the months between April and September, depending on the weather in each year. This corresponds to a cooling energy saving ratio ranging from 19% to 24%. Despite energy savings, OCC had some minor adverse effects on their thermal comfort and perceptions of Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ). Moreover, residents' ratings for indoor thermal comfort dropped from neutral to slightly dissatisfied after the implementation of OCCs.

These products have transformed both our residential built environment and energy supply systems [2], enabling consumers to experience an unparalleled level of convenience [3]. Depending on the role they perform in a home energy management system (HEMS), smart living products are typically categorized into three main groups: user interface (UI), smart hardware, and software platform [4]. The primary role of smart hardware is to physically enable household energy efficiency and demand flexibility [4]. For instance, some smart plugs and thermostats are capable of coordinating the appliance operational schedules with occupant behavior (OB) and the utility's time-of-use (TOU) rate [5,6] to reduce energy consumption and shred peak load. The smart home hardware market has experienced a notable growth in terms of the number of manufacturers in recent years. It was reported that the number of smart home manufacturers had grown from approximately 50 in 2015 to over 250 in North America as of 2021 [7]. Among the HEMS products, the smart thermostat was expected to exhibit the highest growth rate, with its global market size projected to grow from USD 1.3 billion in 2020 to USD 6.8 billion in 2026, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 30 %. According to the 2020 Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) conducted by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) [8], approximately 11.7 % of the 109.35 million households in the U.S. that have a thermostat installed in their home, selected the smart thermostat for energy savings. This corresponds to 12.78 million households. The primary function of a thermostat is to regulate various residential heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) equipment to maintain a comfortable indoor environment for the health and productivity of occupants [9,10]. Recent technologies in environmental sensing [11], occupancy sensing [12], human\u2013machine interface [13], learning algorithms [14], and Internet of Things (IoT) [15] have transformed the form and function of thermostats. These advancements have enabled thermostats to offer a variety of advanced features, including remote access, adaptive scheduling based on learning algorithms, geo-fencing, and integration with other HEMS appliances [16,17], enabling a higher level of convenience for its users. It is widely acknowledged that occupancy sensing sits within the core functionality of a smart thermostat, despite its various advanced features [9,18]. According to recent statistics, only 50 % of households in the United States are occupied during the day, and merely 42 % of homeowners adjust their heating setpoint temperature to conserve energy and lower utility costs when they are away from home [10,19]. Consequently, the occupancy sensing feature of smart thermostats is an effective solution to this issue, as they enable an occupancy-centric temperature reset when no one is present at home, permitting a reduction in heating and cooling load. This feature is comparable to the occupied standby control utilized in commercial buildings [20], which also adjusts the zone temperature setpoint and minimum primary airflow rate based on the occupancy status following the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) standards and guidelines [21,22]. Passive infrared (PIR) sensors are commonly used for occupancy presence sensing in smart thermostats, which detect humans by measuring the infrared radiation emitted by objects in their field of view. Such sensors are widely used in many smart thermostat products on the market, including those produced by ecobee, Nest, and Honeywell [16,17,23,24]. Besides PIR, alternative and assistive technologies such as radar technology [25] and location sharing via mobile apps [26] are also applied to improve the accuracy of occupancy detection. Researchers have also developed enhanced PIR sensors integrating novel designs to improve detection accuracy under various scenarios. For example, researchers have tried adding a narrow semi-transparent optical chopper to the traditional PIR sensor for identifying the presence of stationary occupants with high-accuracy [27]. Other researchers have used sensor fusion technologies by integrating two types of sensors in one shell for enhanced accuracy performance, such as integrating PIR and ultrasonic sensors [28], and PIR and microwave sensors [29]. Detailed reviews about the various sensing technologies for occupancy inference can be found in references Yang et al. [30], Dong et al. [31], and Sun et al. [32]. 1.2 Literature review of case studies Multiple computer simulation studies have been conducted to explore the potential energy savings associated with smart home thermostats. For instance, Lu et al. [12] utilized EnergyPlus simulations to assess the energy-saving potential of smart thermostats with occupancy sensing in five U.S. cities, including Houston, TX, and Minneapolis, MN. Their findings indicated an average energy-saving ratio of 28 %. Wang et al. [33] employed a co-simulation framework that combined EnergyPlus and Universal CPS (i.e., Cyber-Physical System) Environment for Federation, a tool developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), to calculate the energy savings of occupancy-centric HVAC controls (OCC) in residential buildings. The simulation results revealed that the HVAC energy-saving ratio ranged from 11 % to 34 % depending on the climate. In another study, Pang et al. [6] conducted a nationwide EnergyPlus simulation to quantify the energy-saving opportunity of smart thermostats in 40 representative U.S. cities under various building energy code versions, fuel types for space heating, foundation types, and control strategies. The results revealed that nearly three-quarters of the cities had a saving ratio less than 15 % under a four °C occupied-standby temperature setback. Depending on the local climate, an eight °C setback temperature could result in an additional 5 % to 10 % savings compared to the 4 °C setback strategy. Although simulation-based studies offer advantages such as low cost, the ability to assess multiple locations, and relatively long-term analysis compared to field testing, they are also subject to inherent limitations that may compromise the credibility of their findings [34]. For example, energy savings resulting from OCC temperature setbacks in residential buildings are highly dependent on household profiles, which are influenced by factors such as the number, age, and employment status of household members [35]. Therefore, any change in occupancy assumptions can affect the potential for energy savings. Additionally, many simulation-based studies assume error-free sensor performance when calculating HVAC energy consumption [6], despite the inevitability of false positive (FP) and false negative (FN) errors in real-world operations [36]. This deviation from reality can further distort energy-saving outcomes. Hence, field testing cannot be overlooked in assessing the actual energy-saving potential of OCC in real buildings, due to the limitations of simulation-based approaches. Despite being relatively limited compared to simulation-based studies, notable examples of field-testing studies are reviewed and summarized in Table 1 . As presented, six case studies were identified through a literature review that utilized a tool developed by Zhang et al. [37]. These studies were conducted in test buildings located across two states in the U.S., Canada, UK, and France. Among the six case studies, four were conducted in one or more residential halls consisting of multiple apartment or condo units [38\u201341], while the remaining two [42,43] were conducted in multiple single-family homes. The publication year of the case studies ranged from 2011 to 2021. The reviewed case studies exhibit significant variation in the heating and cooling energy saving ratios (ESR). Notably, [41] reported the highest heating ESR, where the testing was conducted for two winter months in Lyon, France, and the ESR ranged between 30 % and 60 % for most scenarios. On the other hand, [39] reported a heating ESR between 5 % and 8 % in Davis, CA. Two factors have contributed to the significant savings variation on these reported case studies. Firstly, discrepancies in HVAC control strategies, system configurations, testing periods, and local climates have played a significant role. One instance is [42], where the control strategies were not specified and left at the discretion of the residents. Secondly, in some studies, ESR was calculated indirectly due to the lack of installed metering or sub-metering systems for collecting energy consumption data, which could potentially result in errors in energy savings estimations. For example, Woolley and Peffer [38] estimated the annual ESR based on HVAC equipment runtime reduction, while Yano and Imahara [41] approximated heating energy consumption using the openness ratio of radiator valves. It is noted that the occupancy sensors can also be used for ventilation controls in residential buildings. For instance, Laverge et al. [44] put forward a dynamic residential DCV (Demand-Controlled Ventilation) strategy that utilizes data on relative humidity, occupancy status, and indoor CO2 concentration to regulate the operation of the ventilation fan. Sherman and Walker [45] conducted simulations and field testing to demonstrate that implementing proper control of residential mechanical ventilation systems could result in energy cost savings of 20 % to 40 % associated with ventilation, while still meeting the ASHRAE Standard 62.2\u20132007 requirement [46]. 1.3 Research gaps and opportunities Occupancy-driven smart thermostats have shown potential for energy savings based on both simulation and field-testing studies. However, several research gaps remain. Firstly, while some commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) smart thermostats and compatible occupancy sensors are available on the market, new technologies for occupancy presence detection (e.g., motion sensors with less false negative) are emerging. Hence, field experience integrating general occupancy sensors not natively compatible with the smart thermostat product is valuable [47]. Secondly, while simulation-based studies have investigated the influential factors affecting the ESR and DR benefits of OCC in residential buildings (e.g., the climate [6] and occupant behavior [48]), the instances of field testing of occupancy sensors and/or occupancy-driven smart thermostats are limited. As noted by Pritoni et al. [39], energy savings obtained from simulations may deviate significantly from field testing, even if the models are well calibrated. Therefore, more field-testing studies involving real occupant perceptions are necessary to validate the energy savings of smart thermostats in real building operations. Thirdly, the existing case studies summarized in Table 1 suffer from various issues hindering quantifying the pattern of HVAC energy savings. For instance, multiple field-testing studies only lasted for a short period [40,43], failing to demonstrate energy savings in both heating and cooling seasons. Furthermore, the sub-metering system was missing in several case studies [40,41,43], making the calculation of energy savings less credible. Additionally, some studies did not consider the impact of weather on energy savings, while others did not clearly define the control strategies adopted by the smart thermostat [41,43], making the actual energy-saving potential incomparable. Lastly, the impact of OCC on the thermal comfort of occupants was seldomly investigated in existing field-testing studies. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate how smart thermostats influence the occupant\u2019s thermostat using field data (e.g., survey with occupants). 1.4 Objectives The objective of this study is to propose a new field-testing approach to evaluate the HVAC energy-saving potential of occupancy-driven thermostats in a residential apartment in College Station, Texas. This research stands out from existing studies in several ways. \u2022 A testing framework that links the residential thermostat relay with the non-compatible prototype occupancy sensor using a low-cost Raspberry Pi microcontroller is developed. \u2022 An extensive sensing plan comprising various environmental sensors, including lighting sensors and smart plugs, was implemented to separate the HVAC energy consumption from the overall electricity consumption of the apartment. This is crucial because some residential buildings may not allow for the submetering of HVAC systems. \u2022 This study employed an advanced machine learning algorithm, i.e., XGBoost, to eliminate the impact of weather and varying occupancy profiles on HVAC energy consumption. By implementing this model, the investigation into energy savings was extended beyond the testing phase to encompass multiple years, and effectively incorporating the influence of occupancy profile uncertainties on HVAC energy consumption. \u2022 This study investigated the effects of occupancy-centric temperature setbacks on household energy usage patterns and the occupants' thermal comfort levels. The remainder of this paper is outlined as follows. Section 2 introduces the methodology employed in this study such as control strategy, the development of the testing framework, and the disaggregation of HVAC energy consumption from the household utility. Section 3 introduces the apartment setup in this case study, such as the layout plan, household profile, and sensing plan. Section 4 presents the field testing results in terms of the HVAC energy savings pattern, and impacts on occupant\u2019s thermal comfort and HVAC load profiles. Section 5 concludes the study, provides a summary of the limitations, and suggests future research directions. 2 Methodology 2.1 Sensing and control strategy 2.1.1 Occupancy sensor As mentioned in Section 1.4, this study used the occupancy presence sensing system developed by Wu et al. [49] for the testing of occupancy-driven thermostats in a residential setup. The system is essentially a PIR sensor that has been modified with a liquid crystal (LC) optical shutter to actively and electrically chop the signal received by the PIR sensor in the long-wave infrared (LWIR) region. This modification enables the system to detect stationary occupants in the field of view (FOV) with relatively high accuracy. The system, known as SLEEPIR, has been reported to have a large FOV of 100° and high accuracy in detecting stationary occupants within a range of 4.0 m. To further improve its prediction accuracy, advanced learning-based algorithms [47] and temperature-sensitive adaptive algorithms [48] were added to the system. Additional details about the sensor's structure and algorithm can be found in the developers' publications [49\u201351]. It is important to note that the focus of this paper is on investigating the energy savings of an occupancy-driven thermostat in a residential setup rather than sensor performance testing and analysis, even though it was a prototype occupancy sensor [49] that was utilized in this study. The occupancy sensor should only be considered as one of the many hardware components facilitating the implementation of occupancy-driven temperature setback control in the testing site. Additionally, while we collected data on the sensor's accuracy performance, we will not discuss these results in this paper due to a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) with the sensor development team, as this information is proprietary. Please refer to the comprehensive insights in [49\u201354] for the accuracy of SLEEPIR sensors across various scenarios and iterations. Wu et al. [49] initially demonstrated that SLEEPIR sensors can reliably detect stationary occupants within a 3.0-meter range, achieving a remarkable 100 % accuracy. Further validations revealed accuracy rates of 98.96 % and 99.57 % in both activity-based and daily routine-based datasets [52]. Based on the first-generation sensor, Wu et al. [50] introduced an integrated SLEEPIR sensor module, combining the PIR technology and machine learning to achieve an impressive 99.12 % accuracy when utilizing a support vector machine classifier in real-world occupancy scenarios. It's worth noting that SLEEPIR's accuracy is significantly influenced by environmental conditions, as demonstrated by an accuracy level exceeding 92 % in distinct room surface temperature setups with a thermoelectric model [51]. Lastly, in a recent approach, Chen et al. [54] integrated SLEEPIR with the occupancy state switch detection (SSD) algorithm, multilayer perception featuring statistical feature inputs, and long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithms. These experiments yielded detection accuracy rates ranging from 82 % to 94 % for SSD, 80 % to 90 % for Stat.ML, and exceeding 95 % for LSTM, in both controlled and uncontrolled environments. In comparison, a review paper conducted by Sun et al. [32] summarized that the accuracy of typical PIR sensors varies from 86 % to 97.2 % in occupancy counting and occupancy detection applications. This occupancy sensing system will be referred to as the \u201coccupancy sensor\u201d in the following sections for brevity and clarity. In this study, multiple sensor nodes were incorporated into the system to detect the occupancy status of various zones. A typical networked system, which includes a sensor hub and multiple sensor nodes, is presented in Fig. 1 . The sensor hub is a Raspberry Pi microcontroller that synchronizes information from the single sensor nodes and generates an occupancy presence status for the entire home. In the field testing, the occupancy presence information was passed to the hardware platform via a wired connection. Details about the hardware platform will be discussed in Section 3.3. The occupancy sensing system evaluated in this study can detect the presence or absence of occupants on a sub-minute basis. However, to ensure the robustness of HVAC controls and the battery life of the sensors, the sampling frequency has been set to 1 min. 2.1.2 Raspberry Pi Thermostat The occupancy sensor adopted in this study is a prototyped system and was not readily compatible with any smart or non-smart thermostat product on the market by the time the testing was finished. Hence, a workaround was taken to custom-build a hardware platform that integrates the sensing system with the residential HVAC equipment through relays. A temperature regulator based on a Raspberry Pi micro-controller was established to replace the original programmable thermostat. The physical and wireless connections between the various components are depicted in Fig. 2 , where solid and dashed lines represent the two types of connections. The controller Pi retrieves information from two sources for the implementation of control. The first source is the real-time occupancy presence information which is passed to the controller Pi via a wired connection between the controller and the sensor hub. The second source is the indoor temperature which is obtained based on a digital temperature sensor compatible with the embedded system development. A continuously running Python script on the controller Pi updates the zone temperature and occupancy every minute and sends an electric signal to the relay to turn on or off the heating or cooling system based on the OCC algorithm (see Section 2.1.3). The wired connections are facilitated by the General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) feature of the Raspberry Pi [55]. A Virtual Network Computing (VNC) connection was established using the RealVNC software to enable a remote access to the Pi controller. This enabled the team to inspect the system's operation status and perform debugging work from a remote location, without disrupting the occupants. 2.1.3 OCC Strategy: Temperature Setback The application of occupancy presence sensors includes occupancy-centric temperature setback controls and DCV, as reviewed in Section 1.2. This study puts its focus on temperature setback control considering the HVAC system configuration of the testing site (see Section 3.1). The HVAC control strategy is presented in Fig. 3 . The solid blue and red lines in the graph represent the cooling and heating modes, respectively, for the baseline mode, while the dashed blue and red lines represent the cooling and heating modes, respectively, for OCC model. The heating and cooling temperature setpoints during the occupied period are 75.2 and 78.8 °F (24 and 26 °C), respectively. The temperature setpoint is set back by 14.4 °F (8 °C) during the unoccupied period to save HVAC energy consumption. The occupants of the test building determined the heating and cooling temperature setpoints during the occupied period. The significant difference between the temperature setpoints of the Baseline and OCC modes was chosen to achieve greater energy savings, with consent from the occupants. 2.2 Sensing and metering plan 2.2.1 Sensor type The testing site was equipped with two types of sensors serving different purposes. The first type was the HOBO U12 Temp/RH/Light External Data Logger. This is a four-channel logger with 12-bit resolution and can record up to 43,000 measurements for the indoor temperature, relative humidity, and lighting level. The second type was an Emporia Smart Plug that was connected to the electrical outlet and recorded the energy consumption of the plugged household appliance. The detailed configurations of these sensors are presented in Table 2 . 2.2.2 Metering plan The main electricity end-users in the testing site comprise the lighting, plugged equipment, and HVAC systems. To accurately measure the energy consumption of these three end-uses, it would be ideal to install a sub-metering system, which involves modifying the existing building electrical circuits. However, due to restrictions imposed by the management of the testing site (see Section 3.1), modifications to the electrical system were not permitted. Therefore, an alternative approach was adopted to estimate the energy consumption of the HVAC system, using the utility bill and sensors as described in Section 2.2.1. Following the definition provided in Eq. (1), the electricity consumption of the testing site can be expressed as the aggregate of the electricity consumption of three sub-systems. Specifically, E Total denotes the overall electricity consumption of the apartment, while E HVAC , E Light , and E Plug correspond to the electricity consumption of the HVAC system, lighting system, and plugged equipment, respectively. By deducting E Light and E Plug from E Total , the electricity consumption of the HVAC system (i.e., E HVAC ) can be obtained. (1) E Total = E HVAC + E Light + E Plug This study obtained the total electricity consumption, E Total , from the utility service company by submitting a request for tracking household electricity consumption at 15-minute intervals. The data was stored in an online account and can be accessed for a customized range of dates. The cumulative energy usage of household appliances connected to electrical outlets, denoted as E Plug , is monitored with the assistance of multiple Emporia Smart Plugs installed at the testing site. The smart plugs enable real-time tracking of the electricity consumption of all electric equipment at the testing site. Hence, E Plug can be computed using Eq. (2), where i denotes the number of the smart plug used for measurement. The recorded data is saved in an online database provided by the service provider and sent to the researchers every three weeks via emails, as set up by the testing team. (2) E Plug = ∑ i = 0 n E Plug , i In this study, the total electricity consumption of the lighting system, denoted as E Light , is calculated by summing the electricity consumption of each lighting fixture. The computation is expressed in Eq. (3), where P light , i denotes the capacity of the lighting fixture i , t Light , i represents the duration during which lighting fixture i is turned on, and n is the total number of lighting fixtures. The value of P light , i is determined by examining the model of the incandescent light bulb(s) present at the testing site. The operating time of the lighting fixture, t Light , i , is estimated by analyzing the local lighting intensity level recorded by the U12-012 sensors positioned at various locations throughout the testing site. (3) E Light = ∑ i = 0 n t Light , i ∗ P light , i An example of inferring the operating status of the lighting fixtures based on the light intensity data is illustrated in Fig. 4 . The blue line indicates the measured light intensity, while the red line represents the inferred ON and OFF status. It should be noted that, since the lighting fixtures in the testing site do not support dimming, the operating status is determined only in two stages. 2.3 Data analysis Fig. 5 provides an overview of the data collection and analysis process. Firstly, a range of sensors, as described in Section 2.2, were deployed at the testing site to gather electricity consumption data for the entire unit, as well as specific lighting fixtures and home appliances. Secondly, the HVAC electricity consumption was computed using the sensor data, following the approach outlined in Section 2.2. Additionally, weather data for the testing period is obtained from an online database, while occupancy schedules are captured using occupancy sensors (Section 2.1.1), both of which are essential for energy efficiency evaluation. Subsequently, various data analysis techniques, including feature engineering and the utilization of the XGBoost algorithm, are employed to train data-driven models for quantifying energy savings. Finally, the study investigates several scenarios to gain deeper insights into the potential energy savings under different weather conditions. 2.3.1 Prediction model Weather normalization is essential for energy efficiency evaluations [56] since it enables a fair comparison of energy consumption across different periods by mitigating the impact of weather variations. The commonly employed methods for weather normalization include the degree-day-based method [57], change-point-model-based method [58], and simulation-based method [59]. In this research, a data-driven approach utilizing XGBoost is employed to calculate HVAC energy consumption under both OCC and baseline modes, thus enabling accurate quantification of energy savings. XGBoost [60] is a scalable end-to-end tree boosting algorithm that is widely used in the data science competition and research domain. The core concept of boosting pertains to an ensemble methodology that integrates numerous models into a single entity so that this composite model tends to provide superior predictive accuracy compared to individual learners. The inclusion of new models within this ensemble continues iteratively until no further improvements can be made. While XGBoost has numerous strengths, it is not exempted from certain limitations and drawbacks. First, XGBoost can be prone to overfitting in certain circumstances. To overcome the issue of overfitting, the XGBoost model integrates a regularization approach. This regularization shares similarities with the strategy employed by regularized greedy forests, albeit simplified for scalability and parallel computations. Besides, the algorithm is notably resource-intensive, requiring significant computational power and time to train the model. In this research, a Dell Precision 3630 workstation equipped with a hexacore processor operating at 3 GHz and 16 GB of RAM was utilized for model training and energy savings calculations. 2.3.2 Feature engineering In this study, a feature engineering approach was taken to create and select the model's input parameters, a strategy aimed at augmenting predictive accuracy [61,62]. Potential input parameters include those directly sourced from field measurements and weather data, as well as engineered features derived through feature engineering. These features are presented in Table 3 for reference. It is worth mentioning that not every feature listed in Table 3 was included in the final model. The LOFO (leave one feature out) [64] method was utilized to select features. Specifically, the process of feature selection employed is rigorous and iterative, with each feature individually omitted from the set, followed by an evaluation of the model's performance. A feature is ultimately discarded from the final model if its exclusion leads to an enhancement in the model's predictive accuracy. 2.3.3 Model training The raw data was divided into two distinct datasets to facilitate the training process. The splitting was performed based on the HVAC control mode (i.e., the baseline mode and OCC mode). Each dataset was further split into training and testing datasets. The training dataset comprises 75 % of the data, allowing the model to learn from a substantial portion of the available information. The remaining 25 % of the data was allocated for testing and evaluating of the model's performance and generalization ability. 2.3.4 Model training Tuning the hyperparameters of an XGBoost model can be a challenging task for practitioners, as it involves optimizing the values of various parameters that could affect the model's performance and generalization ability. Hence, a Python library named ray [65] is adopted in this study to tune the hyperparameters of XGBoost. Ray provides a powerful and flexible framework for distributed computing and hyperparameter optimization. In this case, the integration of Ray with XGBoost significantly simplifies the process of tuning the hyperparameters and ensures that the model performs at its best and yields accurate results in prediction. It is important to highlight that we developed distinct prediction models for HVAc energy consumption for both the baseline and OCC (Occupancy) modes. This deliberate approach allows for a precise and meaningful comparison of energy savings while effectively quantifying the impact of occupancy. The model's performance is assessed using the Mean Bias Error (MBE) and Coefficient of Variation of Root Mean Square Error (CV-RMSE) metrics. As shown in Eq. (4) and Eq. (5), both MBE and CV-RMSE are computed by comparing the ground truth values (denoted as y ) with the corresponding predicted values (denoted as y ^ ), while taking into account the sample size (denoted as n ). (4) MBE = 1 n ∑ k = 1 n y k - y k ^ (5) CV - R M S E = ∑ k = 1 n ( y k - y k ^ ) 2 n / ∑ k = 1 n y k n 2.3.5 Evaluation scenarios 2.3.5.1 Weather scenarios By leveraging the power of data-driven models, we can expand the quantification of HVAC energy savings ratios of OCC beyond the field-testing period. This study explores various scenarios, outlined in Table 4 , to gain insights into the potential HVAC energy savings across different weather conditions. It is noted that since the testing site is situated in a predominantly cooling climate and the testing period was primarily scheduled during the cooling seasons, this study did not investigate the energy savings potential of OCC during the heating mode. 2.3.5.2 Occupancy schedule The energy efficiency of OCC is intrinsically linked to the occupancy schedule, as energy savings are typically realized during periods of non-occupancy when a temperature setback is implemented. Scenario #1, the field-testing scenario, uses measured occupancy schedules as input for predictive models to calculate HVAC energy consumption for both Baseline and OCC models. Conversely, the remaining six scenarios necessitate the creation of statistical occupancy schedules, which are derived from field measurements to formulate an annual occupancy schedule. This study adopts a similar approach to [68] by utilizing a combination of clustering and Markov Chain methods to generate statistical occupancy schedules for Scenarios #2 - #7. To provide a visual representation of the framework, a diagram is presented in Fig. 6 . The process begins by organizing the collected occupancy schedules from the testing period between January 31st and July 4th, 2022, into daily schedules for analysis. Next, a K-means clustering model is developed to identify the typical occupancy patterns within the field-testing data. Based on the results of the clustering analysis, the testing days are grouped into distinct categories. Subsequently, for each category, a dedicated Markov Chain model is trained to generate statistical occupancy schedules that capture the dynamic and stochastic nature of occupant behaviors within that specific group. Finally, in Scenarios #2\u20137, each of the 365 days is assigned a cluster number, and the corresponding Markov Chain model is utilized to generate random occupancy schedules. Considering the stochasticity in generating statistical occupancy schedules, 1,000 Monte Carlo iterations of occupancy schedules are conducted for each of Scenarios #2\u20137. This approach enables the modeling of dynamic occupant behaviors and provides valuable insights into the impact of statistical characteristics of occupancy patterns on HVAC energy consumption. 3 Case study 3.1 Testing site The testing site for OCC is an apartment unit located in College Station, TX. The apartment is situated on the second floor of a three-story complex consisting of a total of 12 units. The photo of the building is illustrated in Fig. 7 , wherein the specific apartment used for testing is highlighted by a red circle. The apartment unit itself has a total floor area of approximately 81.5 m2 (877 ft2). The layout plan of the apartment is illustrated in Fig. 8 . As shown, the apartment is a 2-bedroom and 2-bathroom unit, with a living room and a kitchen. A photo of the apartment building is displayed in Fig. 7, and the red box in the image encircles the location of the apartment unit used for testing. The household of the apartment selected for testing consists of two research staff members employed at a local university. They typically leave for work in the morning and return in the afternoon or at night, so the apartment was mostly vacant during the daytime on weekdays. This apartment unit is equipped with a dedicated direct expansion (DX) coil for space cooling and an electric furnace for space heating. The supply airflow rate is fixed and cannot be adjusted during operation, which means that the HVAC system has only three possible states: heating, cooling, and off. It is important to note that there is no mechanical ventilation system in this apartment unit. College Station, Texas falls under the International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) climate zone 2A, known for its hot and humid summers with high cooling requirements and mild winters with moderate heating demands. Meteorological measurements from the National Weather Service (NWS) [69] indicate that between 2000 and 2022, the mean dry-bulb temperature for January and August in College Station was recorded as 51.1 °F (10.6 °C) and 96.2 °F (35.7 °C), respectively. 3.2 Hardware installation The multiple hardware components for testing were installed at the testing site in December 2021. These components include occupancy sensors, HOBO U12-012 data loggers, smart plugs, and the Raspberry Pi microcontroller-based thermostat relay for temperature setback controls, as introduced in Sections 2.1 and 2.2, respectively. The locations of the hardware are indicated in Fig. 8 using different shapes corresponding to the different types of hardware. 3.2.1 Occupancy sensors Four occupancy sensor nodes were installed at the testing site to cover the primary living spaces of the occupants, including the living room/dining room, kitchen, and two bedrooms. The sensors were mounted on the walls to ensure that their FOV could capture occupant activities effectively while minimizing interference from non-human sources. The sensor developer team was counseled when determining the locations of installation. The sensor developer team was consulted to determine the best locations for installation. Photos of the sensor installation are presented in Fig. 9 , where the yellow and white components on the walls can be seen. 3.2.2 Other sensors A total of eight HOBO data loggers were placed at the testing site to monitor and record the indoor temperature, relative humidity, and light levels within the apartment. All areas with a luminaire were covered by one sensor, as illustrated in Fig. 8. Fig. 10 displays images of the sensors installed in the living room and kitchen areas. The sampling frequency of the HOBO data loggers was set as 5 min in this study. The testing site's household appliances, including but not limited to computers, monitors, stoves, electric kettles, and a fridge, were powered through smart plugs to enable electricity consumption monitoring and recording, except for the oven, which remained unused during the testing. A total of 11 smart plugs were finally placed in the household to cover all the appliances. Fig. 11 provides an example of the smart plugs used for this purpose. The sampling frequency of the smart plugs was set as 5 min in this study. 3.3 Raspberry Pi thermostat The installation process of the Raspberry Pi thermostat framework, which was explained in detail in Section 2.1.2, is depicted in Fig. 12 . The sensor hub and a temperature sensor were connected via cables to the Raspberry Pi controller, which in turn was wired to a 6-channel thermostat relay. The occupancy sensor hub received signals from the four sensor nodes and transmitted an apartment-wide occupancy signal to the thermostat Raspberry Pi. The Python script running on the thermostat Raspberry Pi analyzed the indoor temperature and occupancy status and sent out an electrical signal to the 6-channel thermostat relay. The relay was hardwired to the HVAC control board to control the HVAC system accordingly (see Fig. 13 ). In this study, the control frequency is set to 1 min, which is consistent with the sampling frequency of the occupancy sensor. The alignment of control frequency with occupancy sensor sampling frequency facilitates a more precise and prompt HVAC system response to variations in occupancy, resulting in enhanced occupant thermal comfort while reducing energy wastage. 3.4 Testing schedule The schedule of the field testing is illustrated in Fig. 12, where the blue and red boxes represent the baseline and OCC modes respectively. Hardware installation began in December 2021, and the system was completed and validated in January and February 2022. Formal testing occurred from February 28th to July 4th, 2022, lasting approximately 4 months. The control modes were switched between the baseline and OCC mode on a weekly basis to mitigate the influence of outdoor weather conditions on HVAC energy consumption. 3.5 Summary This study strictly adhered to the International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP) [70] guideline for measurement and validation (M&V) regarding installing the necessary hardware for energy collection, collecting energy consumption data over an extended period, monitoring energy consumption separately for baseline and control modes, and employing statistical methods to quantify the energy savings accurately. Table 5 summarizes the hardware components used in the testing process. It is important to note that the sampling frequency varies among different hardware devices. Additionally, the sampling frequency for electricity consumption data collected from the utility service provider is 15 min. Therefore, all the data collected in this study was resampled to 5 min for all analysis to ensure the consistency. 4 Results and discussions 4.1 Model training 4.1.1 Preliminary analysis A preliminary analysis was conducted to inspect the energy pattern of OCC and baseline modes. The hourly HVAC load data has been segmented into bins based on outdoor dry-bulb temperature, with a range of 0.5 °C for both OCC and Baseline weeks. The average HVAC load under specific dry-bulb temperature scenarios was determined by averaging points within the same bin. The results are presented in Fig. 14 , with blue and red dots representing the average hourly HVAC load under the OCC and Baseline modes, respectively. A smoothing process was applied using the Python tsmoothie package [71] to facilitate the comparison, and the smoothed results are presented in blue and red lines for the OCC and baseline modes. Additionally, the frequency distribution of different outdoor dry-bulb air temperatures during the testing period is visualized with the green line in the lower half of the figure. The results indicate that HVAC energy savings were generally achieved with the implementation of OCC in the cooling season. However, it is important to note that this preliminary comparison is not entirely fair since the energy consumption was normalized solely by outdoor weather conditions, without considering the influence of occupancy presence, which is also a significant driver of energy consumption. This discrepancy explains why, for certain temperature ranges, no energy savings were observed. For instance, the energy consumption above 38 °C was notably higher for OCC compared to the Baseline. This disparity can be attributed to the fact that high temperatures often occurred in the afternoon during the testing period when occupants returned home. In the OCC mode, the HVAC system operated for an extended duration to lower the indoor temperature, which was high during unoccupied hours, to a comfortable range, resulting in higher energy consumption. In contrast, the Baseline mode maintained a consistent temperature for an entire day and did not require additional cooling, thus leading to lower energy consumption in the afternoon. This clarifies why, in the high-temperature range, OCC's energy consumption exceeded that of the Baseline. A more accurate comparison and calculation of energy savings are presented in the following subsections. 4.1.2 XGBoost model Following the process of feature engineering analysis in Section 2.3.2, the selected features incorporated in the models are AirTemp, DewpointTemp, HeatIndex, DD, DH, GHI, Hour, Weekday, NotHoliday, and OccPresence (refer to Table 3 for details). The results of the finalized model training for the cooling mode are presented in Fig. 15 as an example, with the x-axis representing the measured daily HVAC power consumption and the y-axis illustrating the predicted outcomes. The data points have been resampled to show the daily average power consumption for the sake of clarity. The prediction models for both the baseline control mode and OCC mode demonstrate good accuracy, as evidenced in the figure. The complete CV-RMSE and MBE results are further detailed in Table 6 . Overall, all results comply with the recommendations set by ASHRAE's Guideline 14 [72] for building energy measurement and verification. 4.1.3 K-Means clustering As introduced in Section 2.3.5, random occupancy schedules that mirror the tested household's occupancy pattern is generated through the application of K-means clustering and Markov Chain methods. A portion of the clustering results are presented in Fig. 16 , where the x-axis denotes the time of day and the y-axis displays the clustering results. The occupied and unoccupied states of the apartment during the test period are represented by blue and grey colors, respectively. Each row illustrates the daily results. The clustering analysis identifies three distinct clusters. A detailed exploration of these patterns, expressed as the proportion of each cluster within each type of day, is presented in Fig. 17 . The three bars for each day type sum up to 1. The first cluster, constituting 74 % of the test days, mostly incorporates conventional workdays. This entails the occupants departing the apartment in the morning for work and returning in the afternoon. The second cluster, accounting for 18 % of the testing duration, primarily encompasses weekends where occupants spend the night out and return late at night or early in the morning. The third cluster represents instances when the occupants remain home throughout the day. These instances form 8 % of the data, with most of these days being holidays and weekends. 4.1.4 Sample occupancy schedules Fig. 18 displays twelve sample daily occupancy schedules generated by the Markov Chain model of Cluster 1. The y-axis is labeled with \u201cN\u201d and \u201cY\u201d to represent the unoccupied and occupied status, respectively. The figure demonstrates that the Markov Chain models effectively capture the dynamic patterns of occupant behaviors of the testing household. 4.2 HVAC energy savings 4.2.1 Scenario 1 To compare HVAC energy consumption under baseline and OCC modes, the measured occupancy schedules and actual weather data are utilized as inputs for the respective models. The results are presented in Fig. 19 . The x-axis represents the computed baseline HVAC load, while the y-axis represents the OCC HVAC load. It demonstrates that the HVAC energy consumption of the baseline mode is generally higher, suggesting HVAC energy-saving potential for the OCC mode. Table 7 presents the quantified energy-saving ratios obtained from the analysis. The implementation of OCC resulted in estimated electricity savings of 108.8 kWh for cooling mode during the period February 28th to July 4th, 2022. The energy-saving ratio for the cooling mode was noticeable at 15.1 %. 4.2.2 Scenarios 2\u20137 Fig. 20 shows the annual cooling energy savings for Scenarios #2\u20137. Each subplot exhibits a histogram representing the cooling season of a single year (i.e., April to September), spanning from 2018 to 2022, as well as the TMY (Typical Meteorological Year). Each histogram comprises 1000 data points, where each point corresponds to a stochastic occupancy schedule scenario (see Section 2.3.5.2). The x-axis represents the bins of HVAC energy savings, while the y-axis represents the density probability of the bins. To facilitate a comparative analysis, the mean and median values are annotated in the figures with a blue dashed line and red line, respectively. Furthermore, the arithmetic mean (μ) and 3σ (three times the standard deviation) are provided as textual annotations beneath the title to serve as additional points of reference, covering approximately 99.7 % of the data points. As shown in the figure, the absolute cooling energy savings for various scenarios exhibit consistent patterns, ranging from 257 kWh to 331 kWh. The standard deviation among the different scenarios was also comparable, showing an approximately normal distribution pattern. Notably, Years 2021 and 20,022 demonstrated the highest annual energy savings, both approximately 331 kWh in mean/median electricity savings, whereas Years TMY achieved approximately 257 kWh in savings. Overall, 99.7 % of the MC simulation cases analyzed fell within a range of approximately 16 % of the mean or median value of the simulation cases. The cooling energy saving ratio is presented in Fig. 21 . Similar to Fig. 20, each subplot presents a histogram depicting the cooling season of a single year spanning from 2018 to 2022, along with the TMY. Each histogram includes 1000 data points representing stochastic occupancy schedule scenarios. The x-axis displays the cooling energy-saving ratio bins, while the y-axis shows the density probability of these bins. To aid the interpretation, the figures include annotations of the mean and median values represented by a blue dashed line and red line, respectively. Additionally, μ ± 3σ is provided as textual annotations below the title, serving as additional reference points. What can be observed from this figure is that the energy savings ratios also exhibit an approximately normal distribution pattern. The mean/median value showed moderate variation across different years. The highest cooling energy-saving ratio was achieved in 2021, reaching 24 %, while 2022 had the lowest energy-saving ratio at approximately 18.7 %. Nevertheless, the standard deviation was very similar for different years. The majority of the MC simulation cases were within ± 3 % of the mean value. Such energy savings results are generally in agreement with the nationwide simulation results conducted for Houston, TX in [6], which is in the same climate zone as the test site. The results of Scenario #1 (i.e., the energy-saving ratio from field testing) were situated in the lower part of the histogram for Year 2022. This was due to the limited duration of the testing, which spanned approximately four months from March to early July 2022. Notably, the month of August, which typically experiences high outdoor temperatures and thus potentially yields more energy savings from OCC, was not considered in the energy savings calculation. As a result, the energy-saving ratio of Scenario #1 appeared smaller than the mean value of the annual cooling savings ratio. The reason for the similarity in absolute energy savings between 2021 and 2022, despite the moderate variation in the HVAC energy savings ratio, can be primarily attributed to the varying baseline HVAC energy consumption resulting from different outdoor weather conditions in those years. The baseline cooling energy consumption results for different scenarios are presented in Fig. 22 . Fig. 23 illustrates the distributions of the dry-bulb outdoor temperature during the typical cooling season (April to September). Notably, the Year of 2022 experienced the highest outdoor air temperature among all scenarios during the cooling season, resulting in a notably higher baseline cooling energy consumption. Conversely, the Year of TMY and 2021 had lower dry-bulb outdoor temperatures in the cooling season, leading to lower cooling energy consumption. The variations in outdoor weather conditions directly impacted the baseline energy consumption, which, influenced the observed differences in HVAC energy savings ratio between the two years in return. A more detailed parametric analysis was conducted to investigate the influence of outdoor weather conditions and occupancy profiles on the energy-saving ratio of OCC. The investigation involves systematically varying the outdoor weather temperature between 25 °C and 39 °C, with intervals of 2 °C. For demonstration purposes, each simulation scenario spans just one day with the outdoor temperature held constant. Additionally, as part of the parametric analysis, the occupancy profile was further varied within each temperature bin. This involved adjusting the occupancy hours to explore the impact of unoccupancy duration on energy savings. We evaluated a range of occupancy scenarios. Starting with Scenario 1, where residents remain at home throughout the day, we progressed to Scenario 15, where after departing at 10 AM, the home is left unoccupied for a full 14 h. The results of the parametric analysis are presented in Fig. 24 . The x-axis of the graph represents different scenarios of occupied hours. The y-axis illustrates the various outdoor temperature conditions. A lighter color in the graph indicates a higher cooling energy-saving ratio. As depicted, the energy-saving ratio exhibits a range between 0 % and 32 %. Notably, a prolonged duration of unoccupied hours in a day proves advantageous in realizing the energy-saving potential of OCC. Moreover, it is interesting to note that the energy-saving ratio is not inherently higher or lower with outdoor air temperature increasing. The temperature range yielding the highest cooling energy savings ratio lies between 27 and 35 °C. This outcome arises from the interplay of factors: an increase in outdoor air temperature results in higher baseline cooling energy consumption, thus leading to a lower cooling energy-saving ratio. It also explains the patterns as observed in Fig. 21. 4.3 Peak load An important and concerning issue linked to the implementation of OCC is the occurrence of surging peak loads when the home is reoccupied [6]. The application of temperature setbacks leads to extended periods for the HVAC system to restore the zone temperature to a comfortable level, consequently increasing peak loads. These challenges can potentially impact the reliability of grid operations and lead to higher utility bills, especially when the outdoor air temperature is high and time-of-use electric rates are in effect. Similar issues are observed in this field-testing study. An illustrative example of June 3rd, 2022 is presented in Fig. 25 . The red, green, and blue lines in the graph represent the HVAC load, outdoor air temperature, and indoor air temperature, respectively, with each line having its own y-axis from left to right. On this particular day, both occupants left home for work in the morning and then returned in the afternoon. As depicted in the figure, the occupants left the home at around 11 AM on that particular day, enabling the activation of the temperature setback. As the outdoor air temperature increased to around 32 °C, the indoor temperature also rose from 26 °C to over 28 °C. The apartment was re-occupied at 4 PM, leading to a peak load of approximately 1500 W to restore the indoor temperature to a comfortable range. This example highlights the surging peak load issue associated with the implementation of OCC during the re-occupancy phase. Fig. 26 presents a more comprehensive analysis for evaluating the influence of OCC implementation on the peak HVAC load during the cooling season using field measured data. The analysis focuses on the workdays between May 30th, 2022 (Monday) and July 1st, 2022 (Friday). The x-axis represents the average outdoor dry-bulb temperature between 1 PM and 7 PM, while the y-axis illustrates the peak hourly HVAC load within the same time frame. The red and blue colors represent baseline and OCC modes, respectively. As observed, the implementation of OCC had a negative impact on the peak demand of the testing apartment, as the HVAC load remained high (over 1000 W) even during periods of relatively mild outdoor air temperature. It is important to note that some data points of the OCC mode overlapped with those of the baseline mode due to the occupant mostly working from home during these days. As a result, the peak load issue was not as obvious during these instances. This highlights the complexity of the OCC impact on peak loads and underscores the significance of considering occupant behavior and occupancy patterns in such analyses. 4.4 Thermal comfort The indoor air dry-bulb temperature of the living room is visualized for both baseline and OCC modes to assess the impact of OCC implementation on occupants' thermal comfort. The investigation focused solely on the temperature during the hours when the setpoint was not met to mitigate the potential distortion of evaluation results considering the unbalanced proportion of occupied and unoccupied hours between the baseline and OCC modes in this case study, given that the testing was conducted in a real apartment, and the duration of occupied periods was entirely based on the actual behaviors of the occupants. The results are visualized in Fig. 27 , where the x-axis represents the 24 h in a day, and the four rows in the y-axis correspond to the occupied and unoccupied periods during the baseline and OCC modes. A darker color indicates a higher indoor temperature during the setpoint not met hours, which could potentially result in more occupant's thermal discomfort. As presented, during the occupied period, both baseline and OCC modes exhibited unmet hours in the afternoon, particularly around 4 PM. The most significant difference between the two modes was observed around 5 AM to 8 AM and 10 AM to 12 PM when the OCC mode showed a higher indoor temperature, approximately 1 °C higher than the baseline mode. This discrepancy might be attributed to FN errors of the occupancy sensors. Regarding the unoccupied periods, it is evident that the OCC mode consistently maintained a higher indoor temperature, approximately 0.5 °C higher than the baseline mode. This outcome can be attributed to the implementation of OCC during the unoccupied periods, indicating its impact on indoor temperature regulation during such periods. An examination of the relative humidity data revealed no discernible distinction between the relative humidity levels during OCC modes and baseline modes. Additionally, a questionnaire was created on Qualtrics to collect occupants' ratings for indoor environmental quality (IEQ) before and during the testing. The IEQ survey was primarily based on the Occupant Indoor Environmental Quality Survey developed by the University of California Berkeley's Center for the Built Environment [73]. However, to optimize the time required to complete the survey, a few irrelevant questions were eliminated. It is noted that the design, distribution, data processing, and storage of this questionnaire underwent thorough review and approval by the Texas A&M University Institutional Review Board (IRB) under IRB2021-1399 M. This approval ensures compliance with ethical considerations and safeguards for the participants involved in the survey. The responses from the residents' survey indicate that the implementation of OCC had some minor adverse effects on their thermal comfort and perceptions of IEQ. Specifically, residents' ratings for indoor thermal comfort shifted from neutral to slightly dissatisfied after the OCC was enabled. Additionally, they expressed concerns that the indoor air became slightly staler during the OCC week, resulting in a drop in their rating for air quality from satisfied to slightly dissatisfied. This was in agreements with the sensors\u2019 measurements, as presented in Fig. 27. 5 Conclusions, Limitations, and Future work 5.1 Conclusions This paper presents a field-testing study conducted in a residential apartment unit located in College Station, TX. The study explores an innovative prototype occupancy presence sensing system and occupancy-centric HVAC controls (OCC). To enable OCC implementation, a Raspberry Pi-based hardware framework was established, connecting the occupancy sensor with the existing HVAC system. Various sensors were deployed at the testing site to measure the energy consumption of the HVAC system during both baseline and OCC modes. To facilitate a fair comparison, data-driven XGBoost models were trained to account for the impact of factors such as occupancy and outdoor weather conditions on HVAC energy consumption. Furthermore, the analysis was extended beyond the testing period, encompassing the years from 2018 to 2022 and TMY3 (Typical Meteorological Year 3), leveraging a developed statistical occupancy schedule generator and corresponding meteorological data for various scenarios. The following conclusions are drawn from this study. Firstly, the occupancy presence sensing system demonstrates a significant energy-saving ratio for residential setups. Based on field-testing data and predictions from XGBoost Models, it is estimated that approximately 15.1 % cooling energy consumption could be saved during the testing period, equivalent to around 109 kWh in electricity savings. Moreover, when extending the models to years from 2018 to 2022 and TMY3, OCCs have the potential to achieve electricity savings ranging from 300 to 330 kWh, depending on the weather in each year. This corresponds to a cooling energy saving ratio ranging from 19 % to 24 %, depending on the baseline energy consumption in a given year. Secondly, occupancy profiles and outdoor weather significantly impact the energy savings and energy-saving ratio of OCCs. A prolonged duration of unoccupied hours in a day proves beneficial in realizing the energy-saving potential of OCC. Due to the randomness of occupant behaviors and occupancy schedules, there could be a 3 % variation in the actual energy-saving ratio of OCCs. The actual energy savings and savings ratio are strongly correlated with outdoor air temperature, with the highest cooling energy savings ratio observed within the temperature range of 27 to 35 °C. Thirdly, the implementation of OCCs introduces a surging peak load issue, particularly in the afternoon. The peak HVAC load on OCC days during the afternoon was equal to or even higher than the peak HVAC load on some baseline days, despite lower outdoor temperatures on OCC days. This indicates that the peak load issue may be more pronounced during higher outdoor temperatures. Lastly, a check-up of indoor temperature data and survey responses on Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) suggests that the implementation of OCCs might have adverse impacts on occupant's thermal comfort and indoor air quality. This impact was particularly obvious during the hours of 5 AM to 8 AM and 10 AM to 12 PM when the reported indoor temperature was approximately 1 °C higher than that of the baseline mode due to False Negative (FN) errors (during the periods when the setpoint was not met). Consequently, residents' ratings for indoor thermal comfort decreased from neutral to slightly dissatisfied. The satisfaction level regarding air quality also dropped from satisfied in the baseline mode to slightly dissatisfied in the OCC mode. 5.2 Limitations and Future work Despite the findings, this study has several limitations that present opportunities for improvement in future work. Firstly, restrictions imposed by the property management prevented the installation of a sub-metering system. As a workaround, HVAC energy consumption was inferred from the total electricity consumption, minus the lighting and household appliance usage. However, this approach wasn't as accurate as direct measurements from a sub-metering device. Future research should aim to include direct, accurate measurements of HVAC energy consumption to enhance the reliability of results. Secondly, due to a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) with the sensor developer team, the accuracy performance of the proprietary prototype occupancy sensor was not fully disclosed. Consequently, we were unable to investigate the quantified relationship between FN and False Positive (FP) errors and their impact on energy savings and thermal comfort. It's important to acknowledge that different sensors may exhibit varying accuracy performances, leading to diverse outcomes concerning energy savings and thermal comfort. Specifically, a higher FN error can potentially increase HVAC energy savings but at the expense of occupant thermal comfort. Conversely, a higher FP error may align better with thermal comfort requirements but could reduce the energy-saving potential. Future work should incorporate an analysis of sensor accuracy to establish a more precise understanding of these relationships. Lastly, the study was conducted in College Station, TX, a cooling-dominant region. As such, we did not explore energy savings during the heating season. Future studies should extend their investigations to other climates to provide a more comprehensive understanding of potential energy savings across different seasons.

        "dc:description": "While many simulation-based studies have demonstrated the energy-saving potential of occupancy-driven smart thermostats in residential buildings, field testing of these devices remains relatively limited. The objective of this study is to propose a new field-testing approach to evaluate the heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) energy-saving potential of occupancy-driven thermostats and occupancy-centric controls (OCC) for HVAC in a residential apartment in Texas, U.S. A proprietary prototype occupancy sensing system was chosen for this study, coupled with a Raspberry Pi-based hardware framework to facilitate OCC implementation by linking occupancy sensors to the existing HVAC system. Energy consumption of the HVAC system during both non-OCC baseline and OCC modes was measured using various sensors installed at the test site. Furthermore, XGBoost models were developed, used onsite measurements, to consider the effects of various factors like occupancy and outdoor weather conditions on HVAC energy consumption to facilitate a fair comparison. The scope of the analysis was further expanded to cover the period from 2018 to 2022 and Typical Meteorological Year 3 (TMY3) by incorporating a statistical occupancy schedule generator. The results suggest that approximately 15.1% cooling energy consumption could be saved during the testing period, equivalent to around 109 kWh in electricity savings. Moreover, OCCs have the potential to achieve electricity savings ranging from 300 to 330 kWh in the months between April and September, depending on the weather in each year. This corresponds to a cooling energy saving ratio ranging from 19% to 24%. Despite energy savings, OCC had some minor adverse effects on their thermal comfort and perceptions of Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ). Moreover, residents' ratings for indoor thermal comfort dropped from neutral to slightly dissatisfied after the implementation of OCCs.",
