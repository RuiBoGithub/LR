Heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system plays a significant role in demand response (DR) to reduce the peak load of the grid. Conventionally, only the sensible load is reduced by increasing the indoor temperature during DR periods and the latent load is rarely concerned. This study proposes a temperature & humidity (T&H) setback strategy for HVAC systems to reduce both the sensible and latent cooling loads by adjusting the supply air temperature and chilled water supply temperature simultaneously. The performance of the T&H setback strategy is analyzed from the perspectives of peak shedding, energy saving and indoor thermal comfort and compared with the common temperature setback strategy. The impact of weather conditions and occupant densities on the performance of T&H strategy is assessed. Results show that the energy saving of the HVAC system under the T&H setback strategy can be up to 39.0% and peak shedding can be increased to 37.1%, which are both higher compared with the temperature setback strategy. The peak shedding and energy saving of the T&H setback strategy is larger when the buildings have lower sensible or higher latent load. The T&H strategy can improve the flexibility of buildings during DR periods effectively. Keywords HVAC Demand response Peak shedding Energy saving Thermal comfort Temperature & humidity setback 1 Introduction Building energy consumption accounts for a major part of the total energy use in developed countries (Fathi et al. 2020) (Li, You, Zheng, Wang, & Wang, 2020) and shows obvious peak-valley differences due to the human activities. These factors bring challenges to the reliability of the power supply and are unfavorable for the sustainable development of the grid. Many studies are conducted for energy saving technologies in buildings, such as building envelope optimization (Huang et al. 2021; Buratti et al. 2015) and heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system optimization (Han et al. 2021; Coelho & Mariani 2013). Demand response (DR) is an effective way to reduce the building peak electricity demand. Demand response, defined by DOE (Energy 2006), is a tariff or program established to motivate changes in electric use by end-use customers in response to changes in the price of electricity over time, or to give incentive payments designed to induce lower electricity use at times of high market prices or when grid reliability is jeopardized. By participating in the DR programs, occupants adjust their behaviors to reduce the power use during the peak periods or shift the electricity load to another time. The HVAC system contributes to a large percentage of energy consumption in buildings (Kim, Kim, & Kim 2019; Li et al. 2020; Pérez-Lombard, Ortiz, & Pout 2008). Therefore, implementing appropriate DR strategy in HVAC systems is of great significance for the energy saving, peak load reduction, power supply reliability of important facilities and the economical, sustainable and robust operation of the grid (Winstead et al. 2020). Two types of demand response strategies are often used in HVAC systems including load shifting and load shedding (Tang, Wang, & Li 2021) as shown in Fig. 1 . Load shifting is a strategy to shift full or partial load during peak time to off-peak time by using energy storage or building thermal inertia(Niu et al. 2019; Robert, Sisodia, & Gopalan 2018). Load shedding means the direct load curtailment by increasing the indoor temperature (Romero Rodríguez et al. 2018) or shutting down chillers(Wang, Wang, & Tang 2019). Load shifting is often realized by thermal storage to improve the energy flexibility (Stinner, Huchtemann, & Müller 2016; Yuan et al. 2020; Brahman, Honarmand, & Jadid 2015). It shifts the building load from the peak time to the off-peak time with no or less impact on the occupants\u2019 thermal comfort (Arcuri, Spataru, & Barrett 2017). Four different flexibility and storage options in building energy systems (batteries, fuel switch, water tanks, and thermal building mass) are evaluated and compared to study the improvement in load shifting and energy efficiency (Klein et al. 2017). The results show that the water tank with a capacity of about two full operation hours of the cooling and heating system can offer enough flexibility for the building energy systems. The energy saving potential of a HVAC system with thermal storage tank in DR program is assessed by combining active cool energy storage with temperature adjustment strategy (Meng et al. 2021). The results indicate that the water tank can effectively reduce the number of starts and stops for the heat pump. Combining the cool energy storage and adjusting the cooling temperature can effectively reduce the peak load of the grid with limited impact on occupants\u2019 thermal comfort. Another important strategy is to utilize the thermal inertia of buildings as active storage to shift the cooling load during DR periods (Reynders, Diriken, & Saelens 2017; Rahimpour et al. 2017; Chen et al. 2020). After increasing the indoor temperature setpoint or turning off the air conditioning system, the thermal mass of buildings will release cool energy and postpone the temperature increase. A coupled thermal inertia model of a building and a HVAC system is constructed to study the DR contribution and the coupling effect (Li et al. 2019). The thermal inertia of chillers, pipes and coils in the air-conditioning system is considered. It shows that the thermal inertia of the air-conditioning systems can reduce additional 16.74% of the peak electricity consumption. The potential of buildings to modulate the heating is assessed from the perspective of energy and thermal comfort (Le Dréau & Heiselberg 2016). The results show that much heat can be modulated for short periods in poorly insulated buildings. Less heat can be modulated for a longer time for well insulated buildings. Load shedding is another popular way in DR which is convenient to use in existing HVAC systems. It can be realized in a fast way by using direct load control (DLC), which is to shut down one or more chillers during DR events (Wang, Wang, & Tang 2019; Ran et al. 2020; Tang, Wang, & Shan 2018). It can reduce the power demand of HVAC systems very quickly. However, the indoor thermal environment is usually hard to quantify or control (Tang, Wang, & Shan 2018). The load shedding can also be realized in a gentle way by changing the indoor temperature setpoint (Amin, Hossain, & Fernandez 2020; Erdinç et al. 2017). By increasing the indoor temperature temporarily during the peak time, the cooling load and the electricity consumption of the HVAC system can be reduced. A simulation is conducted to analyze the energy saving of increasing the thermostat setpoints. The energy saving is about 10% by changing the indoor temperature for each degree Celsius according to the simulation in four American cities (Hoyt et al. 2005). DR strategies for the HVAC systems are implemented in commercial buildings according to a whole-building energy simulation in Energy Plus (Christantoni et al. 2016). Three DR strategies are compared including increasing the chilled water temperature for chillers, on/off control for fans of air handling units (AHU) and increasing the zone air temperature setpoint. It shows that the chilled water supply temperature control provides the largest electrical power reduction (up to 14.2%). The temperature adjustment strategy is preferable for zones with higher heat gains. On/off control of fans is preferred in other zones as it provides larger load reduction. The influence of DR strategies on thermal conditions, indoor CO2 concentration and heating energy is examined in an educational office building (Vand et al. 2020). By controlling the space heating temperature, supply air temperature and ventilation airflow, the heating energy consumption can be reduced by up to 8%. To realize the optimal temperature setpoint control for energy savings and thermal comfort, a reinforcement learning architecture is proposed to control the whole-building HVAC systems (Azuatalam et al. 2020). Results show that a maximum weekly energy reduction of 22% can be achieved compared to a handcrafted controller. Temporarily increasing the setpoint temperature may deteriorate occupants\u2019 thermal comfort during DR events (Aghniaey & Lawrence 2018). The occupants\u2019 thermal sensation, acceptability and preference are investigated by increasing the cooling temperature setpoint in a campus building. It shows at least 2 °C can be increased across this campus without scarifying occupants\u2019 thermal comfort (Aghniaey et al. 2019). Many studies investigate the energy saving resulting from increasing the cooling temperature setpoint. However, increasing the indoor temperature will affect the indoor thermal environment so that the DR of the HVAC systems must be implemented with careful control by balancing the energy saving and occupants\u2019 thermal comfort (Aghniaey & Lawrence 2018). The above review shows that many studies have been conducted on the DR strategies in buildings and HVAC systems for load shifting and load shedding. There still exists the following gaps. 1 Using building thermal inertia for the load shifting or adjusting the indoor temperature for the load shedding can realize the load shedding by reducing the sensible cooling load. However, the latent cooling load that relates to the indoor humidity is not concerned. Actually, the latent cooling load accounts for a high percentage of the total building cooling load. Reducing the latent cooling load is supposed to improve the peak shedding potential of HVAC systems. In addition, the acceptable relative humidity for occupants is relatively larger, so increasing the humidity in an acceptable range would be more effective. 2 Shutting down part of the running chillers by direct load control can reduce the indoor sensible and latent cooling load. But the terminal equipment is easy to be out of control and the indoor thermal comfort is usually not concerned. Therefore, a demand response strategy for the HVAC systems that adjusting the indoor temperature & humidity and considering the thermal comfort simultaneously needs to be studied. To fill the above gaps, a temperature & humidity (T&H) setback strategy for HVAC systems that adjusting the indoor temperature & humidity simultaneously is proposed in this study to improve the peak shedding potential during DR periods. It is realized by adjusting the indoor air, supply air and chilled water temperatures simultaneously within given ranges. The performance of the T&H setback strategy under different supply air temperatures, chilled water supply temperatures and loads is analyzed and compared with the temperature (T) setback strategy. The contributions of this paper are as follows: \u2022 A T&H setback DR strategy for HVAC systems that adjusting the indoor temperature and humidity simultaneously is proposed to improve the energy saving and the peak shedding during DR periods. \u2022 The optimal supply air and chilled water supply temperatures are identified under different indoor air temperatures and scenarios to evaluate the performance of the strategy. \u2022 The performance of the T&H strategy is analyzed under different weather conditions and different densities of the occupants to investigate the impacts of load characteristics. The paper is organized as follows. Firstly, the T&H setback strategy is introduced in section 2. Then an office building and its HVAC system is simulated as a case study to verify the effectiveness of the T&H strategy in section 3. The performance of the T&H setback strategy is analyzed and compared with the T setback strategy from the aspects of energy saving, peak shedding and thermal comfort in section 4. The advantages and disadvantages of the T&H setback strategy are discussed in section 5. Conclusions are summarized in section 6. 2 The temperature & humidity setback strategy The T&H setback strategy is illustrated in Fig. 2 . The HVAC system consists of chillers, cooling water pumps, cooling towers, chilled water pumps, air handling unit (AHU) and other auxiliary equipment. The chillers provide chilled water for AHUs to produce cold supply air for buildings. The supply air is delivered into the rooms to remove the indoor heat and moisture. In the conventional temperature setback strategy, only the indoor temperature is increased so that the sensible cooling load is reduced. In the T&H setback strategy, the indoor air temperature and the relative humidity (RH) are increased to reduce both the sensible and latent cooling load. Three steps are used to realize the method: 1 Increasing the indoor air temperature during DR periods. By increasing the indoor temperature, the sensible cooling load of the building is reduced. This is realized by controlling the chilled water flowrate of the AHUs. 2 Increasing the supply air temperature of the air handling units. The supply air temperature would affect the indoor humidity. Therefore, increasing the air supply temperature of the AHU can decrease the dehumidification capacity of the supply air. It would lead to the increase of the indoor RH. The air flowrate of the supply fan in the AHU is adjusted to realize the supply air temperature control. 3 Increasing the supply temperature of chilled water. Since the air supply temperature in the previous step is increased, a higher chilled water supply temperature can be used so that the coefficient of performance (COP) of the chiller is increased. Therefore, the supply temperature of chilled water is increased to reduce the energy consumption of the chiller. Three factors are very important for the performance of the T&H setback strategy: the air supply temperature of AHUs, the chilled water supply temperature and the cooling load. Therefore, the load shedding and indoor thermal comfort of the T&H setback strategy is evaluated considering variations of these three factors. The impact of the latent and sensible load profiles is evaluated by selecting different weekdays and varying the occupant density. To quantify the system performance under the T&H setback strategy, energy saving, peak load shedding, PMV (predicted mean vote) and PPD (predicted percentage of dissatisfied) are used. (1) Energy saving The energy saving is the daily energy consumption reduction ratio of the demand response (DR) strategy, as shown in Eq. 1. (1) Energy saving = ( E before . DR − E after . DR ) / E before . DR Where, E before . DR and E after . DR is the daily energy consumption before and after the DR events. (2) Peak load shedding The peak load shedding is the peak electrical load reduction percentage after the DR events, which is shown in Eq. 2. (2) Peak shedding = ( P before . DR − P after . DR ) / P before . DR Where, P before . DR and P after . DR is the peak electrical load before and after the DR events. (3) PMV and PPD PMV is an index that aims to predict the mean value of votes of occupants on a seven-point thermal sensation scale, in which +3 means too hot and −3 means too cold (Zhao, Lian, & Lai, 2021). The PMV relates to the imbalance between actual heat flow from the body in a given environment and the heat flow required for optimum comfort at the specified activity (ASHRAE 2017), as shown in Eq. 3. PPD is an index to predict the percentage of the occupants that are dissatisfied with the thermal environment, as shown in Eq. 4 (ASHRAE 2017). An online thermal comfort tool published by the Center for the Built Environment in University of California Berkeley is used to calculate the PMV and PPD (Tartarini et al. 2020). (3) P M V = [ 0.303 × e x p ( − 0.036 × M ) + 0.028 ] × { M − W − 3.05 × [ 5.733 − 0.007 × ( M − W ) − p a ] − 0.42 × ( M − W − 58.2 ) − 0.0173 × M × ( 5.867 − p a ) − 0.0014 × M × ( 34 − t a ) − 3.96 × 10 − 8 × f c l × [ ( t c l + 273 ) 4 − ( t ¯ r + 273 ) 4 − f c l × h c ( t c l − t a ) } (4) P P D = 100 − 95 × e x p [ − ( 0.03353 × P M V 4 + 0.2179 × P M V 2 ) ] Where, M is the rate of metabolic heat production (W/m2), W is the rate of mechanical work (W/m2), p a is water vapor pressure in ambient air (kPa), ta is air temperature (°C), f cl is clothing area factor, t cl is clothing surface temperature (°C), t r ¯ is the mean radiant temperature (°C), h c is convective heat transfer coefficient (W/(m2\u2022K)). An office building and its HVAC system modelling To verify the T&H setback strategy, an office building with a gross floor area of 18680 m2 is selected in the case study and the HVAC system is designed and simulated. 2.1 Building information and cooling load calculation The building information including the envelope, the density of the occupants, lighting and devices is shown in Table 1 . The office building locates in Wuhan, which is hot and humid in summer. Since both the sensible cooling load and the latent cooling load are adjusted in the T&H setback strategy, different sensible and latent cooling loads could influence the performance of the strategy. Therefore, three scenarios with different weather conditions and occupant densities are selected. The cooling load of the building under three scenarios is calculated in TRNSYS. Fig. 3 shows the cooling load profiles and the proportion of the latent cooling load in three scenarios. Scenario 1: it is taken as the basic case. The maximum building cooling load is 2231.4 kW and the latent cooling load accounts for 29.8%. Scenario 2: another weekday with lower outdoor temperatures and solar radiation intensity is selected. The latent cooling load in Scenario 1 and Scenario 2 is close but the total cooling load is smaller in Scenario 2 (1947.1 kW). Therefore, the impact of the sensible cooling load on the system under the T&H setback strategy can be compared. Scenario 3: the weather condition is the same with that in Scenario 1 but the occupant density is doubled (4 m2/person). Occupants and fresh air are the main source of indoor latent cooling load. When the occupant density increases, the latent load proportion is higher (40.6%) in Scenario 3. Therefore, the impact of the latent cooling load on the T&H setback strategy can be obtained. The indoor temperature and humidity setpoints determine the building cooling load. To evaluated the cooling load variation, the cooling load under different indoor temperature and humidity setpoints in Scenario 1 are calculated as shown in Fig. 4 . With the increase of the indoor air temperature, the sensible load decreases continuously (from 19554.3 kWh to 16596.0 kWh). With the increase of the RH, the sensible cooling load at same air temperature remains the same but the latent load decreases. According to the load reduction line, both increasing the air temperature and the humidity would lead to a lower cooling load. When the air temperature is increased from 25 °C to 28 °C, the total cooling load is reduced by about 4%∼5% per degree Celsius. Additional 4%∼5% of cooling load would be reduced per 10% increase in indoor RH. It indicates that adjusting the indoor humidity can reduce the cooling load significantly so that it can be used to further enhance the load shedding effect of HVAC systems in the DR events based on the T&H setback strategy. The indoor thermal environment under different air temperature and RH setpoints is evaluated. Fig. 5 shows that PMV and PPD is more sensitive to the temperature compared with the RH. When the air temperature is changed from 25 °C to 26 °C under the same RH, the PPD changes within 2%, which means that only 2% more occupants are not satisfied with the indoor environment changes. When the temperature is high, changing the indoor air temperature has larger indoor thermal environment impact. The PPD increase is about 4%∼7% per degree Celsius when the air temperature is changed from 26 °C to 27 °C. The PPD increase is 9%∼12% when the air temperature is changed from 27 °C to 28 °C. By changing the indoor RH, the PPD increase is less than 1% when the air temperature is 25 °C and 26 °C. When the air temperature is 27 °C and 28 °C, the PPD would increase by 2%∼4% per 10% increase in RH. Therefore, adjusting the indoor RH has similar load reduction effect but leads to less impact on the thermal environment. Improving both the indoor temperature and the RH appropriately can improve the load shedding effect without deteriorating indoor thermal environment dramatically. 2.2 HVAC system modelling The HVAC system for the building is designed and modeled in the TRNSYS to evaluate the performance of the T&H setback strategy. The cooling system consists of chillers, air handling units, pumps and fans. The mathematical descriptions of the models are detailed in this section. Chiller The chiller provides the chilled water to meet the cooling load. Three chillers with capacity of 1049 kW are selected. The coefficient of performance (COP) of the chiller at nominal condition is 5.18. The chiller model is described in Eq. 5∼8 (Xia et al. 2017; Zhang et al. 2020). (5) P = P noc × CAPFT × EIRFT × EIRFPLR (6) CAPFT = CA P full / CA P noc = a + b × ( T chw , out / T chw , out , noc ) + c × ( T cw , in / T cw , in , noc ) EIRFT = ( P full / CA P full ) / ( P noc / CA P noc ) = a 1 + b 1 × ( T chw , out / T chw , out , noc ) (7) + c 1 × ( T cw , in / T cw , in , noc ) + d 1 × ( T chw , out / T chw , out , noc ) 2 + e 1 × ( T cw , in / T cw , in , noc ) 2 (8) EIRFPLR = P / P full = a 2 × pl r 2 + b 2 × plr + c 2 Where, P (kW) is the power consumption of the chiller, which is calculated by the rated power consumption P noc and the factors that rely on the operation conditions. CAPFT is the ratio of the chiller capacity under actual condition ( CA P full ) to the nominal capacity ( CA P noc ). T chw , out , noc and T cw , in , noc are the chilled water supply temperature and the cooling water inlet temperature at nominal condition, which is 7 °C and 30 °C. T chw , out and T cw , in are the chilled water supply temperature and the cooling water inlet temperature at actual conditions. a, b, c are coefficients which is 1.034, 0.2508 and −0.2848. EIRFT is the updated efficiency that relates to the power consumption ( P full , P noc ) and the capacity under the actual and nominal conditions ( CA P full , CA P noc ). Coefficients a 1 , b 1 , c 1 , d 1 and e 1 are 0.5817, 0.01914, 0.006588, −0.09575 and 0.4911, respectively. EIRFPLR is the ratio of the power consumption to the full power consumption under the actual condition, which is calculated by the part load ratio. Coefficients a 2 , b 2 and c 2 are 0.2661, 0.487 and 0.2457, respectively. Air handling unit The air handling unit (AHU) supplies air with low temperature and low humidity to remove the indoor heat and moisture. AHUs with rated total cooling capacity and air flowrate of 34.1 kW and 6000 m3/h are selected. The AHU model in TRNSYS Type 124 is used, which models the thermodynamic properties of cooling coil based on the ASHRAE Secondary Toolkit and modifications proposed by Chillar and Liesen (2004). The AHU model is shown in Eq. 9∼15. (9) Q AHU = U A h × ( h out − h in ) (10) U A h = UA / C p (11) UA = 1 / 1 / U A ext + 1 / ( U A int (12) U A ext = U A ext , rated × x a × ( m air / m air , rated ) 0 . 8 (13) x a = 1 + 0 . 004769 × ( T air , in − T air , in , rated ) (14) U A int = U A int , rated × x w × ( m liq / m liq , rated ) 0 . 85 (15) x w = 1 + ( 0 . 014 / ( 1 + 0 . 014 × T liq , in , rated ) ) × ( T liq , in − T liq , in , rated ) Where, the heat transfer rate Q AHU is expressed as the production of the enthalpy-based overall heat transfer coefficient U A h and the enthalpy difference in Eq. 9. The overall heat transfer coefficient UA and the specific heat across the enthalpy difference C p are used to calculate the U A h as shown in Eq. 10. In the simulation, the UA of the AHU is adjusted with the inlet conditions as shown in Eqs. 11∼15. UA is determined by the air-side overall heat transfer coefficient U A ext and the liquid-side overall heat transfer coefficient U A int , which is calculated by the flowrate and inlet temperature of the air and fluid m air , T air , in , m liq , T liq , in . By iterative calculation, the heat transfer and outlet temperature under the actual conditions are finally obtained. Fan Type 744 in TRNSYS is used to model the variable speed fan, in which the mass flowrate of the air is input to calculate the fan power. Fans with air flowrate and power of 6000 m3/h and 1.8 kW are selected for each AHU. The mathematical description of fans is shown in Eq.16∼18. (16) P fan = P fanrate × ( m air / m rated ) 3 (17) Q air = ( η motor + ( 1 − η motor ) × f motorloss ) × P fan (18) h airout = h airin + Q air / m air Where, the fan power P fan is calculated by the rated fan power P fanrate , the air flowrate m air and the rated air flowrate m rated . The energy transferred from the fan motor to the air Q air is calculated in Eq. 17. Where, the f motorloss is a value between 0 and 1 that determines the proportion of the fan motor inefficiencies that causes a temperature rise in the air stream. The status of the air exiting the fan can be calculated in Eq. 18. The h airout and h airin are the inlet and the outlet enthalpy of the air. Pump The variable speed pump model Type 742 in TRNSYS is used. The chilled water system is a primary constant & secondary variable flow system. The rated flowrate and the head of the chilled water pumps are 50.18 kg/s and 20 m. The rated flowrate and the head of the cooling water pumps are 59.88 kg/s and 30 m. The description of pumps is shown in Eq.19∼23. (19) P pump = P shaft / η motor (20) P shaft = W pump / η pump (21) W pump = Δ p × m fluid / ρ fluid (22) Q fluid = P pumprated × η motor × ( 1 − η pump ) + P pumprated × ( 1 − η motor ) × f motorloss (23) T fluidout = T fluidin + Q fluid / m fluid Where, the pump power P pump is calculated by the shaft power P shaft and the electric efficiency η motor , which is 0.9 in this study. The shaft power is calculated by the work done in pumping the fluid W pump and the pump efficiency η pump , which is set as 0.6. The work done by the pump is calculated by the pressure difference Δ p , fluid flowrate m fluid and the fluid density ρ fluid . Heat transferred from the pump motor to the fluid stream Q fluid is calculated as shown in Eq. 22. Where, P pumprated is the rated power of the pump. f motorloss is the proportion of the motor inefficiencies that causes a temperature rise in the fluid. The temperature of fluid exiting the pump T fluidout can be calculated in the Eq. 23. Energy performance and thermal environment analysis of the T&H setback strategy In this section, the performance of the T&H setback strategy is analyzed. The impact of the supply air and chilled water temperature is investigated and the optimal temperatures are found to explore the energy saving potential of the T&H setback strategy. In addition, the performance of the T&H setback strategy is studied under different weather conditions and occupant densities scenarios and compared with T setback strategy. 2.3 Performance of the T&H setback strategy under different supply air and chilled water supply temperatures Different supply air and chilled water supply temperatures affect the building cooling load and the operation of the fans and pumps significantly. Therefore, the energy performance of the HVAC system is evaluated under different indoor air temperatures and supply air temperatures in Scenario 1 to study the effectiveness of the T&H setback strategy. 2.3.1 Impact of the supply air temperature In the T&H setback strategy, besides the increase of the indoor air temperature, the supply air temperature is also increased to decrease both the sensible and latent cooling load of the HVAC system. The cooling load and indoor relative humidity are shown in Fig. 6 (a). When the supply air temperature is fixed at 14 °C, only the sensible cooling load decreases with the increase of the indoor air temperature from 25 °C to 28 °C. The indoor RH is between 47% to 54% and the latent cooling load changes slightly. In the T&H setback strategy, the supply air temperature is also increased and both the sensible load and the latent cooling load are reduced. The indoor RH is increased to 62% and the energy consumption of the HVAC system can be reduced. The reason is that the dehumidification capability of the supply air is reduced with the increase of the supply air temperature. The indoor thermal environment is shown in Fig. 6(b). With the increase of the indoor air temperature, the PPD and PPD is increased, which means the room is getting warm and increasing occupants feel uncomfortable. The PPD is acceptable when the air temperature is less than 26 °C and the supply air temperature is less than 17 °C. However, when the indoor air temperature is up to 28 °C, the PPD is increased to 20%. Compared with increasing the indoor air temperature, increasing the supply air temperature shows less thermal comfort impact. When the indoor air temperature is 25 °C and 26 °C, increasing the supply air temperature from 14 to 17 °C has little effect on indoor thermal comfort. Therefore, increasing the supply air temperature in a certain interval can reduce the cooling load with less indoor thermal comfort impact. The energy saving and peak shedding of the HVAC system under different indoor air and supply air temperature is shown in Fig. 7 (a). It can be seen that the energy consumption decreases first and then increases with the increase of the supply air temperature. The reduction of the energy consumption is because the cooling load is reduced with the increase of the supply air temperature so that the energy consumption of chillers decreases. However, the fan power is increased with the increase of the supply air temperature. When the increase of the fan power is higher than the chiller power reduction, the total energy consumption of the HVAC system increases. This is because when the temperature difference between the supply air and indoor air becomes smaller, higher air flowrate is needed and leads to higher fan power consumption of the supply air. Therefore, appropriate supply air temperature setpoint is essential for the effectiveness of the T&H setback strategy. From the inflection points of the energy saving line, the optimal supply air temperatures under different indoor air temperatures can be found, which are 15 °C, 15 °C, 16 °C and 17 °C under the indoor air temperature of 25 °C, 26 °C, 27 °C and 28 °C. The energy saving is 0.5%, 6.7%, 12.2% and 17.4%, which is 0.5%, 0.2%, 0.9% and 1.5% higher than the T setback strategy when the supply air temperature is fixed at 14 °C. The peak shedding is shown in Fig. 7(b). The peak shedding trend is similar to the energy saving. Under the optimal supply air temperature setpoint, the average daily peak electrical demand can be reduced by 6.0%, 11.0% and 15.1% under the T&H setback strategy in indoor temperature of 26 °C, 27 °C and 28 °C, which is higher than the T setback strategy. Therefore, increasing the supply air temperature appropriately can reduce the energy consumption and the peak electrical load of the HVAC system, which is better than the T setback strategy. 2.4 Impact of the chilled water supply temperature Increasing the chilled water supply temperature can increase the energy efficiency of chillers. In the T&H setback strategy, increasing the supply air temperature makes it possible for increasing the chilled water supply temperature. In this section, the impact of changing the chilled water supply temperature is analyzed. The energy consumption of HVAC system is shown in Fig. 8 (a). It can be seen that with the increase of the chilled water supply temperature, the energy consumption of the chiller decreases due to a higher coefficient of performance (COP), but the energy consumption of chilled water pumps increases due to the higher chilled water flowrate. Therefore, the energy saving increases first and then decreases. The optimal supply water temperature is selected, which is 9 °C, 9 °C, 10 °C and 12 °C under the indoor air temperature of 25 °C, 26 °C, 27 °C and 28 °C . The energy saving is between 1.8% and 22.3% which is 1.7%∼ 6.4% higher compared with the T setback strategy. Fig. 8(b) shows that the peak shedding increases first and then decreases, which shows the similar trend to the energy saving. The maximum peak electrical load shedding can be 18.32%, which is 4.0% higher than the T setback strategy. The daily peak shedding profiles of the T&H setback strategies under different indoor air temperatures are shown in Fig. 9. It shows that the T&H setback strategy can achieve better performance under different indoor air temperatures. With the increase of the indoor temperature, the peak shedding of the T&H setback strategy rises and the difference between the two strategies becomes larger. The results show that the T&H setback strategy can improve the energy saving and peak shedding effects compared with the T setback strategy. The higher the indoor temperature, the better performance can be achieved. 3 Performance of the T&H setback strategy in different weather conditions In the T&H setback strategy, the sensible and latent loads are adjusted simultaneously. Therefore, its performance would be different under different weather conditions. In this section, another weekday with lower sensible cooling load (Scenario 2) is selected to study the performance of the T&H strategy. In Scenario 2, the operation of HVAC systems is tested under different supply air and chilled water supply temperatures to find the optimal supply air and water temperatures, which uses the same method as used in 4.1. The optimal supply air and chilled water supply temperature in Scenario 2 is shown in Table 2 , which is higher than that in Scenario 1. The reason is that the sensible cooling load is lower in Scenario 2, so the supply air temperature can be increased higher to reduce the latent cooling load without excessive fan energy consumption. The higher supply air temperature means the lower dehumidification capacity, which leads to the higher latent cooling load reduction. In addition, the chilled water supply temperature can be increased to obtain the higher supply air temperature, which is favorable for the coefficient of performance (COP) of the chiller. Based on the selected temperatures, the performance of the T&H setback strategy is investigated in Scenario 1 and Scenario 2 and compared with the T setback strategy. The energy consumption of the HVAC system under the T&H setback strategy in two scenarios is shown in Fig. 10 (a). It should be noted that the results of the T&H setback strategy are based on the selected temperatures in Table 2. The energy saving of the HVAC system operated by the T&H setback strategy in Scenario 1 can reach 1.8%, 8.2%, 15.1% and 22.3%, which is 2.0%, 10.0%, 19.4% and 29.5% in Scenario 2 when the indoor air temperature is 25 °C, 26 °C, 27 °C and 28 °C. It shows that the energy saving is higher in Scenario 2 because of the lower sensible cooling load. The peak electrical load and peak shedding in two strategies under two scenarios are shown in Fig. 10(b). It can be seen that the T&H setback strategy can achieve higher peak shedding when the sensible load is lower (Scenario 2). That is because the supply air temperature can be increased higher to reduce more latent cooling load without excessive fan energy consumption when the sensible cooling load is lower. In addition, a higher chilled water supply temperature can be used so that the COP of the chillers is higher. It shows that the T&H setback strategy can obtain higher energy saving and peak shedding in both scenarios compared with the T setback strategy. The results shows that the T&H setback strategy can achieve energy saving and peak shedding when the sensible cooling load is lower. The indoor thermal environment in two scenarios under the T&H setback strategy is shown in Fig. 11 . Both the PMV and PPD are increased with the increases of the indoor air temperature. For the T&H setback strategy, the PMV and PPD are similar in Scenario 1 and Scenario 2 when the indoor temperature is less than 27 °C. The thermal comfort is a little worse in Scenario 2 when the indoor air temperature is higher than 27 °C. The higher PPD is caused by the higher RH. Compared with the T setback strategy, the PMV and PPD are higher in the T&H setback strategy in both scenarios. That is also because the indoor RH is higher when the HVAC system operates under the T&H setback strategy. 4 The performance in buildings with different occupant densities The density of occupants in different buildings varies greatly, which has significant impacts on the building cooling load. Occupants and fresh air are the main source of latent cooling load, so different occupant densities are considered to evaluate the influence of the indoor latent cooling load on the performance of the T&H setback strategy. The occupant is doubled in Scenario 3 and the system performance is compared with the Scenario 1. The optimal supply air temperature and chilled water supply temperature under different indoor temperatures are selected and shown in Table 3 . The optimal supply air temperature and chilled water supply temperature in T&H setback strategy is higher in Scenario 3. The higher supply air temperature leads to the higher RH and lower latent cooling load. In addition, based on the higher supply air temperature, the higher chilled water supply temperature can be set. Based on the selected temperatures, the performance of the T&H setback strategy is investigated in Scenario 1 and Scenario 3 and compared with the T setback strategy. The energy consumption of the HVAC system under different indoor air and supply air temperature is shown in Fig. 12 (a). In the T&H setback strategy, the indoor air temperature, supply air temperature and the chilled water supply temperature are selected based on Table 3. It can be seen that the energy saving in Scenario 3 is higher. The energy saving in Scenario 3 can be improved to 7.5%, 19.1%, 29.2% and 39.0% under the indoor air temperature of 25 °C, 26 °C, 27 °C and 28 °C, respectively, which is higher than that in Scenario 1. Therefore, the T&H setback strategy is much effective in Scenario 3 due to the higher latent cooling load. The peak electrical load and peak shedding in two strategies under two scenarios are shown in Fig. 12(b). The peak electrical load shedding of the T&H setback strategy in Scenario 3 increases to 7.4%, 17.8%, 28.8% and 37.1% under indoor air temperature of 25 °C, 26 °C, 27 °C and 28 °C, which is 8.9%, 12.2%, 16.7% and 19.6% higher than that in Scenario 1. That is because the latent cooling load reduction is more effective when the latent cooling load is higher. Compared with the T setback strategy, additional 7.4%, 11.9%, 17.6% and 21.3% of the peak shedding can be achieved, which is the highest in the three scenarios. Consequently, the T&H strategy is more suitable for the building with large occupant density or large latent cooling load. The PMV and PPD under the T&H setback strategy in two scenarios are shown in Fig. 13 . The PMV and PPD are higher in the T&H setback strategy in both scenarios. Compared with the Scenario 1, the T&H setback strategy shows larger indoor thermal impact in Scenario 3. When the indoor air temperature is 28 °C, the PMV and PPD can reach 1.04 and 28% in Scenario 3, which is higher than that in Scenario 1. The higher indoor thermal environment impact in Scenario 3 is caused by the higher supply air temperature and higher indoor RH. However, compared with T setback strategy, the increase of PPD is less than 7%, which is within an acceptable range of thermal comfort. Discussion This study proposes a temperature & humidity (T&H) setback strategy for HVAC systems that adjusts the indoor temperature & humidity simultaneously. Both the sensible cooling load and the latent cooling load can be reduced to improve the energy saving and the peak shedding potential during DR periods. In addition, increasing the humidity in an acceptable range would be more favorable due to less impact on the indoor thermal comfort of the occupants. In previous work, increasing the zone air temperature setpoint can reduce 3.9%∼7% of the energy consumption reduction (Christantoni et al. 2016; Vand et al. 2020). If the price incentive is high, the peak load reduction of increasing the indoor air temperature can be increased to 14.34∼26.84% (Amin, Hossain, & Fernandez 2020). A higher reduction (40.9%) can be obtained in the energy consumption of the HVAC system if optimization is conducted (Gao et al. 2020). The peak shedding would vary under different load profiles or building functions when one DR strategy is used. Therefore, it is hard to compare the quantitative results in this paper with existing studies. The effectiveness of the T&H setback method is verified by being compared with the T strategy in the same condition. The above results indicate that it can achieve better performance regarding the peak shedding, energy saving and indoor thermal environment. It should be note that the T&H strategy can achieve the best performance only at appropriate supply air temperatures and the supply water temperatures under each indoor temperature setpoint. The performance of the strategy is affected by the characteristics of the cooling load and the optimal setpoints for the supply air temperature and chilled water temperature would vary for different load profiles. If the objective is to achieve the lowest peak load or the maximum energy saving, it is necessary to develop intelligent optimization algorithms to obtain the optimal supply air and chilled water supply temperatures under different scenarios. The optimal setpoints can be identified at different load profiles. By mapping the relationship between the optimal supply air, chilled water temperature setpoints and the load characteristics, the two temperatures can be selected easily. This could be addressed in the future study. Conclusions In this study, a temperature & humidity (T&H) setback demand response strategy for HVAC systems is proposed by adjusting the supply air and chilled water supply temperatures. The performance of the T&H setback strategy is analyzed under different supply air and chilled water supply temperatures. The impact of weather conditions and occupant densities is investigated. The conclusions are summarized as follows. The proposed T&H setback strategy can realize load shedding and energy saving effectively under different conditions. It performs better under the higher indoor temperature. The energy saving of the HVAC system under the T&H setback strategy can be up to 22.3%, which is 6.4% higher compared with the T setback strategy. The maximum peak electrical load shedding can be up to 18.3%, which is 4.0% higher than the T setback strategy with less than 2% of the increase in thermal comfort dissatisfaction. The supply air and chilled water supply temperature is essential for the effectiveness of the strategy and varies under different conditions. With the increase of the indoor air temperature from 25 °C to 28 °C, higher optimal air supply temperatures (15 °C∼17 °C) and chilled water supply temperatures (9 °C∼12 °C) can be set, resulting in larger energy saving (up to 22.3%) and peak shedding (up to 17.6%) with acceptable thermal comfort. The T&H setback strategy for HVAC system performs better when the sensible cooling load is lower. That is because the higher supply air and chilled water supply temperature can be set so the energy consumption of chillers is reduced significantly. The priority of the T&H setback strategy is also higher compared with the T setback strategy when the sensible load is lower. The T&H setback strategy is more effective for buildings with larger occupant densities or larger latent cooling loads. When the occupant density is doubled, the energy saving of the T&H setback strategy can be increased to 39.0%. The peak electrical load shedding can reach 37.1% and the increase in PPD is less than 7%. The proposed T&H setback strategy can obtain more peak shedding and energy saving compared with the common T setback strategy. It can improve the flexibility of buildings during DR periods. To maximum its potential, optimization in the future work could be conducted to obtain optimal supply air and chilled water supply temperatures under different scenarios.

        "dc:description": "Heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system plays a significant role in demand response (DR) to reduce the peak load of the grid. Conventionally, only the sensible load is reduced by increasing the indoor temperature during DR periods and the latent load is rarely concerned. This study proposes a temperature & humidity (T&H) setback strategy for HVAC systems to reduce both the sensible and latent cooling loads by adjusting the supply air temperature and chilled water supply temperature simultaneously. The performance of the T&H setback strategy is analyzed from the perspectives of peak shedding, energy saving and indoor thermal comfort and compared with the common temperature setback strategy. The impact of weather conditions and occupant densities on the performance of T&H strategy is assessed. Results show that the energy saving of the HVAC system under the T&H setback strategy can be up to 39.0% and peak shedding can be increased to 37.1%, which are both higher compared with the temperature setback strategy. The peak shedding and energy saving of the T&H setback strategy is larger when the buildings have lower sensible or higher latent load. The T&H strategy can improve the flexibility of buildings during DR periods effectively.",
