Residential-level peak shaving is beneficial for the supply\u2013demand balance of buildings with a limited power capacity of renewable energy sources like building-integrated photovoltaics. Thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs) are recognized as flexible resources for peak shaving. In practice, most thermal appliances are controlled by local on\u2013off controllers without any communication and coordination. Multiple appliances may operate simultaneously and produce load peaks. Existing studies assume the existence of an electricity market and time-varying tariffs, which are not always available. This paper developed a model predictive control (MPC) based bottom-up proactive method to leverage the thermal inertia of residential thermal appliances for avoiding household peak load without relying on time-varying tariffs. First, we used a physics-based modeling approach to model the thermal dynamics of several residential thermal devices. Then, we designed a centralized MPC controller to minimize the appliance concurrent operations considering occupant comfort zones and appliance rate powers. Consequently, the house peak load is reduced by minimizing concurrent operations. Simulations over homogenous and heterogenous appliance set validated that the MPC-based proactive scheduling method can effectively reduce household peak load without compromising user comfort too much. Finally, we discussed the impact of control interval, appliance rated powers, and penalty factors on peak avoiding and the computational feasibility of the MPC controller. We concluded that the MPC-based proactive scheduling is feasible and effective for a limited number of thermal appliances with short horizons (i.e., six-step). Replacing a mixed-integer nonlinear program solver with a mixed-integer quadratic program solver could significantly reduce the computational burden. However, the application of the MPC controller to multiple households at the system level is still impractical. Further research efforts are emphasized, like mining and forecasting occupant demand and appliance usage patterns in households and designing scalable control strategies for system-level peak shaving. Keywords Proactive scheduling Thermal appliances Model predictive control Bottom-up Peak avoidance 1 Introduction With the penetration of distributed energy resources (DER) like building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV), the regulation of demand profiles in small-scale consumers like buildings, and households becomes significant for supply\u2013demand balancing. In particular, the peak demand may run out of the local generation capacities and induce unreliable energy supply or more electricity imported from the grid. Thus, peak load shaving becomes an important component of home energy management systems (HEMS). Generation capacity expansion, energy storage systems investment, demand-side management (DSM) are three main approaches to handling system peak load [1]. The first two approaches require high investment and maintenance costs and may induce environmental concerns. Flexible DSM is viewed as a cost-effective and sustainable way to handle peak shaving problems in the literature. 1.1 Related work Two main DSM measures are used for peak shaving in the literature: time-varying price-based control [2\u20134] and incentivization-based direct load control (DLC) [5]. The former assumes a positive correlation between retail prices and system load. During the system peak period, the retail prices are high, so that the appliances are discouraged from operating at that time. Oldewurtel et al. [2] indicated the strong correlation between spot market prices and grid load levels and incorporated a time-varying hourly electricity tariff into the control policy. Zhao et al. [4] mentioned that the real-time price (RTP) based demand response (DR) has the possibility to create new peaks. They modified the RTP signals by raising the prices when the real-time power level exceeds a fixed threshold. In contrast, DLC measure makes a contract with large consumers that some uncritical loads could be directly curtailed during system peak time. The DLC signal characterized by requested load curtailment magnitude and duration may be sent from utilities to consumers for peak shaving. Pipattanasomporn et al. [5] applied a rule-based DLC control for household peak shaving, considering comfort levels and load priorities of key appliances. Model predictive control (MPC) is an active research field in optimization and control theory, where it is studied to produce optimized control decisions by using a dynamic plant model to forecast system behavior and optimizing the forecast [6]. In past decades, MPC has growing applications for dispatching and scheduling energy assets in the HEMSs. Most MPC controllers minimized the buildings\u2019 operational cost for load shaping or peak shaving by taking advantage of the time-varying electricity prices [3,7\u201312]. Chen et al. [7] proposed an MPC-based method to reduce the house bill by using mixed-integer linear programming for scheduling thermal and non-thermal appliances. Rahmani-Andebili studied the scheduling problem of PV panels, diesel generator, plug-in electric vehicle (EV), and deferrable appliances in a smart home [9]. Oldewurtel et al. [10] developed a chance-constrained stochastic MPC to minimize the cost of building climate control, considering weather prediction errors. Ma et al. [11] experimentally validated the benefit of MPC approach for building cooling systems with active thermal energy storage. Zong et al. [3] designed an MPC controller for an office building to schedule space heaters\u2019 energy consumption to off-peak price periods. Mirakhorli et al. [12] developed a behavior-driven and price-driven MPC for cost-efficient control of heat pump, water heater, EV, and battery in individual buildings. The individual MPC controllers of 15,000 buildings were integrated with a residential distribution grid by nodal pricing. Though significant peak and cost reductions of the distribution grid were reported, the feedback of the individual controllers on the price signals must be taken account of when DR is widespread. Few MPC controllers incorporate flat tariff for peak shaving. Dongol et al. [1] designed an MPC controller to shave the peaks in PV feed-in power and load profiles for a household by optimizing the battery operations and minimizing the residual power. Though a flat tariff was used, the solutions are quite sensitive to the selected penalty parameters, and the battery investment is not yet profitable in residential levels. Different time steps of MPC controllers are observed in the literature. Some literature used a large scheduling interval like one hour to improve computational efficiency. Zhao et al. [8] proposed an MPC-based scheduling strategy using non-linear programming to optimize the operation of energy systems day ahead with an interval of one hour in a public building. In [13], a multi-objective MPC with a time step of one hour was designed to control residential heat pumps to optimize the energy cost, environmental impact, additional peak generation capacity, and occupant comfort. A few works used an intra-hour scheduling resolution for load regulation. A multi-time scale stochastic MPC with five-minute and hourly resolutions was proposed in [9] for scheduling hour-scale and day-scale deferrable appliances. In addition, the coordination of multiple TCLs must intelligently exploit the heterogenous occupancy patterns, respect the occupant comfort requirement and adapt to dynamic thermal characteristics of thermal appliances with time-varying external disturbance. Korkas et al. [14] proposed a simulation-based optimization approach to design intelligent energy and thermal comfort management strategies for grid-connected microgrids and buildings with heterogenous occupancy schedules. Results showed significant improvements over alternative rule-based and optimization-based energy management systems by taking advantage of the occupancy information and intelligently and automatically changing the energy demands of each building accordingly. Baldi et al. [15] developed a self-tuning load management program with automatic occupant-building interactions via smart zoning of thermostatic loads and intelligent exploiting of information from building and weather states. Simulation results also demonstrate high energy reductions and comfort improvements. Zheng et al. [16] proposed a general pyramid taxonomy for integrated designs and operations of smart home energy management systems, emphasizing the importance of incorporating user preferences into appliance scheduling problems. The above envisions that coordinating the TCLs for peak shaving should automatically learn and exploit the thermal dynamics of appliances, occupancy preferences, and schedules and incorporate variable weather conditions and other disturbances in optimization models. Model predictive control is a perfect tool to suit for these purposes by recedingly updating the model parameters and external disturbances and obtaining renewed control actions. Since the MPC is often criticized for intensive computation, scalable control strategies for large-scale TCLs have been proposed. Temperature priority-based control (PBC) is a common strategy for aggregated TCLs control [17\u201320]. In this strategy, the TCL units are turned on/off based on a priority list determined by the difference between the current temperature measurement and the temperature setpoints. The model-free nature renders a less computational burden than MPC. In [17], the authors used PBC to control TCLs for continuous regulation reserves. In [18], the PBC was applied to control a large population of HVAC loads for fast primary frequency regulation. Hu et al. [19] extended the PBC by incorporating a novel swapping algorithm to improve thermal comfort and by deriving a bound for the regulation signal within which tacking is guaranteed. The modified PBC was further used in [20] for peak load reduction and load shaping in HVAC and refrigeration systems in commercial buildings. Though avoiding intensive computation than MPC, these control strategies applied essentially a rule-based or logic-based control using only real-time information, which may underestimate the peak shaving potential of flexible assets. Ignoring the characteristic of controlled TCLs may lead to unfair DR participation, for example, a large shopping mall should be prioritized over a small house. Besides, they usually aim for system-level peak shaving and need a large population of TCLs for ensuring a good control performance. Other methods for aggregated TCLs control are also identified in the literature. Nghiem et al. [21] represented the dynamic of building heating systems by task models and developed a scalable and effective building climate control approach by combining optimization and rule-based control. To take account of the disturbance and interactions in the sub-systems, they extended their work in [22] by bounding the system dynamics within monotone affine dynamics. Their control approach needs to determine a number of time-zone parameters and satisfy the feasibility constraint, and the high-complexity scheme makes them not robust against uncertain building thermal demands. Zhou et al. [23] abstracted a large population of houses with heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system (HVAC) into a single virtual house by approximating the relationship between power consumption and average indoor temperature. Similarly, Hao et al. [24] modeled the aggregated flexibility of a collection of TCLs as a stochastic battery with dissipation. Korkas et al. [25] proposed a distributed and automated demand management strategy for a microgrid with 100 heterogenous buildings by quantifying the performance improvement of each building and having feedback-based \u2018personalized\u2019 corrections for each building in an iterative and distributed way. Some studies applied real-time scheduling algorithms in the computing field for peak shaving [26\u201328]. Facchinetti and Vedova [26] applied the periodic task model in real-time systems to represent periodically triggered electric loads and used the earliest deadline first (EDF) algorithm to schedule three periodical pumping loads. The real-time parameters over a period were derived from the physical parameters of electric loads representing their global behavior. Peak reductions were achieved without violating the state constraints. To compensate for the effect of uncertainties, they extended their work and provided a feedback control strategy by dynamically changing the value of timing parameters in [27]. Davide et al. [28] again proposed a real-time scheduling method based on EDF for household peak shaving considering common household appliances. However, these real-time scheduling methods need to determine a number of time parameters from physical characteristics and constraints of the electric load models, which is intensive and error-prone work. Besides, the time-varying effect induced by the external disturbance to household appliances cannot be well captured. 1.2 Main contributions of proposed work This study developed an MPC-based bottom-up intra-hour proactive scheduling method for a set of thermal appliances to reduce the household peak load. The house-level peak load is formulated by the concurrent operations of multiple high-rate-power appliances. The controllable appliances can be separated into thermal and non-thermal appliances. The shifting of non-thermal controllable appliances has to sacrifice the user comfort, while the non-urgent operations of thermal appliances can be delayed or advanced slightly to avoid concurrent operations without interrupting user comfort by leveraging their thermal inertias. Instead of using local on\u2013off control, a central MPC controller was developed to coordinate a set of thermal appliances and minimize their concurrent operations. Several common thermal appliances were modeled and simulated, including an electric chiller, water heater, refrigerator, and freezer. Short scheduling intervals of 2.5 min and five minutes were applied in this study to cater to low-duty-cycle appliances. Simulations over homogenous and heterogenous appliance sets validated that the proposed method could effectively avoid peak load without compromising user comfort too much. Compared with existing work, the major novelties and contributions of this paper include: (1) We focused on the peak avoiding problem at the household level by leveraging the thermal inertia of common thermal appliances. Conventional peak shaving strategies [2\u20135] are passive top-down means. The consumers receive price signals, load regulation signals, or DLC commands from utilities and react with uncertainties and time lag in case of an emergent peak period. Instead of shaving load in a top-down means after the peak happens, we advocate taking proactive bottom-up actions to avoid formulating peak load at the residential level. Instead of using price-based control, the developed method does not require a time-varying tariff but penalizes the concurrent appliance operations. We extended the \u2018pre-heating\u2019 and \u2018pre-cooling\u2019 concepts in office buildings to all thermal appliances and the whole day through predictive management strategies and allowed \u2018delay-heating\u2019 and \u2018delay-cooling\u2019 when necessary. (2) Complementary to price-based and DLC-driven peak shaving strategies, we developed an intra-hour MPC controller to proactively schedule thermal appliances for peak avoiding without relying on time-varying tariffs; According to the literature review above, most MPC controllers for peak shaving assume the existence of electricity markets, utility operators, or load aggregators [3,7\u201312]. However, an electricity market with time-varying tariffs and operators is not always available. The time-varying prices may also increase household bills as the shiftable loads cannot represent the overall energy consumption. The DLC commands are also challenging to determine, and new peaks may be generated due to the rebounding effect of suppressed demand. Other real-time computing methods relied on intensive and error-prone identification and selection of dynamic time-zone parameters [26\u201328]. In addition, the one-hour scheduling interval of MPC controllers is too large to schedule some thermal appliances with a small duty cycle like refrigerators [8,13]. (3) The requirement of occupant comfort, thermal dynamics of different appliances, and variable weather conditions and demands are incorporated into the optimization models. Instead of using complicated occupant comfort indices in objective functions [14,25], soft constraints are enforced to make a trade-off between peak load and occupant comfort degrees. The relaxation of temperature constraints allows the comfort zones to be violated slightly to avoid concurrent appliance operations, and the relaxation of concurrency constraints ensures the comfort zones without being violated too much and allows necessary appliance concurrent operations; Instead of using model-free control strategies (i.e., PBC methods [17\u201320]) relying on only real-time temperatures, the thermal characteristic of different appliances or buildings are taken account of by model-based feedback control strategies. Furthermore, few works investigated the relationships between appliance parameters and the selection of control parameters. We finally quantified the sensitivity of scheduling solutions to control intervals, appliance rated powers, and penalty factors and analyzed the computational feasibility by alternating the number of connected appliances and the length of receding time horizons. 2 Thermal appliance modeling The MPC-based scheduling method requires adequate modeling of the considered appliances to forecast system behavior and produce optimized control decisions. This section describes the simplified physical models of several common thermal appliances, including electric chiller, water heater, refrigerator, and freezer. We applied the equivalent thermal parameter (ETP) approach with lumped parameters to model these TCLs [29,30] and used the conventional on\u2013off control strategy as a benchmark control strategy. Given that these thermal appliances are physically connected in parallel through a local electricity grid and indirectly coupled by the indoor ambient temperatures and heat byproducts of thermal appliances, we made the following assumptions to separately model thermal appliances instead of building a whole circuit model: (1) the big infinite grid provides a constant voltage magnitude regardless of the on/off states of internal residential appliances; (2) the slight variations of indoor temperatures will not affect the operation of refrigerators and freezers, and the ambient temperature parameters of refrigerators and freezers are taken as constant indoor temperature setpoints; (3) the waste heat by refrigerators and freezers is included in the internal heat gains, and the actual internal heat gains are prior-known. For denotation convenience, the following abbreviations are used: EC, WH, RF, and FZ, representing the electric chiller, water heater, refrigerator, and freezer, respectively. 2.1 House thermal model with electric chiller Air conditioning loads are the major energy consumers in residential houses and provide people with necessary thermal comfort. It is crucial to understand the thermal dynamic within houses when developing strategies to shave peak load without sacrificing occupant thermal comfort. In this subsection, we consider the case of a residential house with an electric cooling system, but note that heating can be analyzed in the same way. The ETP model that approximating the building thermal dynamics by a resistance\u2013capacitance (RC) network has been tested and verified in the literature [10,29,31]. The network is comprised of nodes, resistances, capacitances, and excitations. Different network models have been developed for a single building room, such as the three-node thermodynamic model in [3], the fourteen-node model in [7], and the ten-node model in [2,10]. Indeed, a larger number of nodes abstraction can more accurately capture the room thermodynamics. From the control engineering perspective, more nodes mean higher computational burden, and an imperfect model with sufficient nodes could achieve good enough performance given limited computational resources. Thus, we apply a second-order (three-node) RC network model in this study. As shown in Fig. 1 , the second-order RC network model in [29,32] is applied for the considered house, where the outdoor air temperature T o , building mass temperature T m and indoor air temperature T a are considered uniformly distributed and can be abstracted into three nodes. The thermal conductivity between two adjacent nodes are approximated by two heat \u2018resistances\u2019 ( U a and U m ). The heat capacity of building mass and indoor air is approximated by two heat \u2018capacitances\u2019 ( C a and C m ). The excitations include the heat fluxes remove from or injected to the building mass Q m and the indoor air Q a . The RC approximation makes it possible to separate the generation of the thermal building model (describing the heat transfer between zones, walls) from external heat fluxes under different scenarios. The house structures determine the fixed lumped thermal parameters, as listed in Table 1 for the considered house. While the external heat fluxes or excitations are dependent on several time-varying input terms, including outdoor temperatures, operation of HVAC systems, solar radiation, occupancy, and indoor activities. The house thermal model considers the following major heat fluxes that contribute to the building heating/cooling load: (1) conduction through exterior walls, roof, and fenestration based on envelope UA; (2) solar gains Q s from sun radiation; (3) internal gains Q i from lighting, people, equipment and other end-uses; (4) heat removed Q EC by the electric chiller systems; To determine the contributions of heat fluxes to both air and mass temperature variations, three proportional factors ( f EC , f s , f i ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] ) are defined representing the proportions of electric chiller, solar gain and internal gain heat fluxes that go to the building mass, respectively. Overall, the dynamic equation is given as formula (1). The dynamic model needs time-varying input data (internal heat gains, solar heat gains, and outdoor temperature), as listed in Table 2 , and fixed ETP parameters, as listed in Table 1. Note that the control inputs for all considered appliances are binary values representing turning on (\u20181\u2019) or off (\u20180\u2019) actions. (1) T ̇ a t = 1 C a ( U a [ T o t - T a t ] + U m [ T m t - T a t ] + Q a t ) T ̇ m t = 1 C m ( U m [ T a t - T m t ] + Q m t ) Q a t = ( 1 - f E C ) Q E C t + ( 1 - f s ) Q s t + ( 1 - f i ) Q i t Q m t = f E C Q E C t + f s Q s t + f i Q i t Q E C t = - μ E C t P E C t u E C t , u E C t ∈ { 0 , 1 } 2.2 Water heater model Water heater is another type of high-power thermal appliances in households. To design the modeling of an electric water heater to be computationally fast, yet reasonably accurate, we make the following assumptions: (1) Thermal stratification in the tank is ingored. The injection of cold inlet water at the bottom of the tank results in complete mixing with the hot water in the tank. (2) Water is heated by only one heating element so that a binary (on/off) control is adopted. As shown in Fig. 2 , an RC circuit model is used to model an electric water heater, where a capacitance ( C w ) models the water heat capacity, two resistances R loss and R usage capture the heat loss to the ambient environment, and the heat transfer through the hot water usage, respectively. The heating element serves as a \u2018current source\u2019 excitation Q elec . The internal hot water temperature T w , the ambient temperature T a , and the injected cold-water temperature T cold are abstracted as three \u2018voltage\u2019 nodes. The heat transfer Q elec , Q loss , and Q usage can be viewed as \u2018currents\u2019 flowing in the branch circuits. The dynamic Eq. (2) can be derived by analyzing the RC circuit model. (2) T ̇ w = Q e l e c - Q l o s s - Q d e m a n d c w · V w Q e l e c = μ w · P w · u w Q l o s s = ( T w - T a mb ) R l o s s Q d e m a n d = ( T w - T c o l d ) R u s a g e R l o s s = R w A w , R u s a g e = 1 D u s e v d e m a n d c w where T ̇ w is the first differential of hot water temperature, c w is the specific heat capacity of water, V w is the volume of the water tank, Q elec is the heat transferred from the heating element to the hot water, P w is the rated power of the heating element, u w is the binary input for turning on/off the heating element, μ w is the efficiency of heating element, Q loss is the heat lost to the ambient environment due to the heat conduction, the heat resistance R loss is expressed as the ratio of the heat resistance of water heater shell R w to the surface area A w , Q demand is the heat demanded by the hot water usage, the hot water usage is modeled by a resistance R usage , which can be expressed as the inverse of the multiples of externally forecasted binary usage indicator D use , the constant hot water flow rate v demand during the usage, and the specific heat capacity of water c w . Table 3 gives the parameters for the considered electric water heater in this study. Except for the fixed parameters, the water heater also needs future time-varying hot water demand data D use . 2.3 Refrigerator and freezer model Several researchers have studied the modeling of household refrigerators [35\u201338]. In [36], a quasi-steady-state approach was used to model refrigerators considering refrigerated compartments and heat exchangers. A self-tuning method was put forward to identify the thermal parameters, such as conductances and capacities. For simplification, we make the following assumptions: (1) The effects of heat gains from food and heat loss from opening doors are not considered. The major heat gains that contributed to the refrigerator thermal load are the heat conducted through refrigerator or freezer walls. (2) The thermal parameters of the refrigerator and freezer are identical except for the temperature setpoints. Both refrigerator and freezer have only one compartment. (3) The compartment temperature is controlled by turning the compressor on and off, while the heat exchangers are not modeled. A coefficient of performance simplifies the energy transfer loop. (4) We assume a fixed ambient temperature and do not consider external disturbances caused by refrigerator/freezer door openings and food takings. In Fig. 3 , the RC circuit model is used to mimic the thermal dynamics of a refrigerator or freezer, where a capacitance ( C rf / f z ) models the internal air heat capacity, the conductance UA rf / f z captures the heat gain from the ambient environment through heat conduction. The heat transfer by the compressor is modeled by a \u2018negative current source\u2019 Q rf / f z , and the internal air temperature T rf / f z and the ambient temperature T a are modeled as two virtual \u2018voltage\u2019 nodes. Compared with the water heater, one difference is that there are no external-forced terms. The thermal dynamic is only dependent on the physic parameters and the user-specific parameters like temperature setpoint. The dynamic of the compartment temperature can be described by Eq. (3), which is derived by analyzing the energy balances and the RC circuit model. (3) T ̇ r f / f z = 1 C r f / f z ( U A r f / f z ( T a - T r f / f z ) - Q r f / f z ) Q r f / f z = μ r f / f z · P r f / f z · u r f / f z where Q rf / f z is the heat removed from the refrigerator or freezer by the refrigeration loop and compressor operations, μ rf / f z is the energy transformation efficiency in the refrigeration loop, P rf / f z is the rated power of the compressor, and u rf / f z is the on/off control input to the compressor. Table 4 lists all the parameter values used in this study and their definitions. 2.4 Forward difference approximation Below we illustrate a first-order forward difference approximation method that can be used to obtain a discrete-time approximation for the non-linear continuous-time state-space control model expressed above. Consider the continuous-time state-space control model as (4), the dynamic of states ( x ̇ t ) are function ( f ) of the current state ( x ( t ) ) and current control inputs ( u ( t ) ) at time t. (4) x ̇ ( t ) = f ( x ( t ) , u ( t ) ) Let the gradient x ̇ ( t ) of state vector x ( t ) at each time t be approximated by the following forward first-order finite-difference expression. (5) x ̇ ( t ) ≈ x ( t + Δ t ) - x ( t ) Δ t Substituting (5) in place of x ̇ ( t ) in (4), one obtains (6) x ( t + Δ t ) ≈ x ( t ) + f ( x ( t ) , u ( t ) ) · Δ t For i = 0 , 1 , ⋯ , let i denote the time interval [ t 0 + i Δ t , t 0 + ( i + 1 ) Δ t ] and one obtains (7) x ( i + 1 ) ≈ x ( i ) + f ( x ( i ) , u ( i ) ) · Δ t Therefore, we obtain the approximated discrete-time state-space control model of the above thermal appliances as below. (8) T a i + 1 = T a i + 1 C a ( U a [ T o i - T a i ] + U m [ T m i - T a i ] + Q a i ) · Δ t T m i + 1 = T m i + 1 C m ( U m [ T a i - T m i ] + Q m i ) · Δ t T w i + 1 = T w i + 1 c w V w ( μ w · P w · u w i - A w R w ( T w - T amb ) - D use v demand c w ( T w - T cold ) ) · Δ t T rf i + 1 = T rf i + 1 C rf ( U A rf ( T a - T rf i ) - μ rf · P rf · u rf i ) · Δ t T fz i + 1 = T fz i + 1 C fz ( U A fz ( T a - T fz i ) - μ fz · P fz · u fz i ) · Δ t The discretization or control interval Δ t is the minimum time resolution of each thermal appliances. It is closely related to the approximation accuracy and computational complexity. In this study, Δ t = 2.5 m i n s is taken as the base level, which would be adjusted later to investigate the impact of the control interval on peak avoiding. 2.5 Traditional on\u2013off control In practice, both on\u2013off and PID controllers are common local control strategies for residential thermal appliances that handle the deviations between actual temperatures and setpoints in different ways. Though the temperature control performance of PID control is more precise than on\u2013off control, the latter is used for local control in this study due to the straightforward design and implementation and its constant power consumption. In contrast, the PID controller constantly adjusts the magnitude of control input (i.e., compressor speed) according to the errors between temperature setpoints and feedbacks, resulting in unpredictable time-varying power profiles, which are not expected in our settings. Taking the on\u2013off controller of the electric cooling system as an example, the cooling system is switched on when the indoor air temperature exceeds the thermostat setpoint. The cooling system switches off when the temperature is below the thermostat setpoint. Practical on\u2013off controllers usually have a deadband or comfort zone around the setpoint to avoid high-frequency switching. The controllers remain unchanged when the measured temperatures lie within this comfort zone. When the temperatures move outside the comfort zone, the switching actions are taken. This control strategy for the electric cooling system is presented in equation (9). (9) u i + 1 = 0 , T i < T l o w e r - l i m i 1 , T i > T u p p e r - l i m i u i , T l o w e r - l i m i ⩽ T i ⩽ T u p p e r - l i m i where u i is the binary control input of the electric chiller at time step i, T i is the measured temperature, T lower - l i m i and T upper - l i m i are the lower and upper limits of the temperature comfort zone, respectively. After randomly specifying the initial temperatures and on/off states, the simulated thermal dynamics of the four appliances above using an on\u2013off control strategy are illustrated in Figs. 4\u20136 . Due to the large size of the hot water storage tank and the high heat capacity of water, the temperature time constant of water is much smaller than that of house air and the internal air of the refrigerator and freezer. The comfort zone of hot water temperature is also set larger than that of the indoor air temperature, considering occupant\u2019s higher tolerance to hot water temperature variations. As the disturbances to refrigerators and freezers are few, their duty cycles remain unchanged during the day. In contrast, the duty cycles of electric chiller and water heaters vary with daytime, due to the external-enforced changing hot water demand, time-varying solar gains, and internal gains. Note that all time-varying input data were extracted from the GridLAB-D simulation results, and the parameters for electric chiller were obtained from the GridLAB-D technical documents [30,33]. The adopted parameters for the water heater was sourced from the literature [34]. The adopted parameters for refrigerator and freezer were sourced from the literature [38]. In practice, these lumped parameters can be identified from the experimental tests using historical data and identification methods (e.g., Newton-Raphson method) [36]. 3 Proactive scheduling method This section presents the MPC-based proactive scheduling method for household peak avoiding. As shown in Fig. 7 , the proposed method consists of a central MPC controller and a group of local controllers. Each local controller is associated with a thermal appliance, serving as an actuator by executing the commands from the MPC controller. The central MPC controller includes three types of forecasters (weather forecaster, occupant demand forecaster, temperature forecaster) and an MPC scheduler. The occupant demand forecaster forecasts the future hot water usage data and internal heat gains in the prediction horizon. The weather forecaster provides future weather condition data in the prediction horizon, such as outdoor temperatures and solar radiations. At the same time, the temperature forecaster takes the constant thermal parameters, forecasted occupant demand, external disturbance data, and control actions to forecast future temperature variations. The thermal parameters of appliances can be inferred from historical measurement data using system identification methods [39]. The MPC scheduler is the core module where TCL's on/off commands are computed from solving online optimal control problems (OCPs) over the prediction horizon. The sequential control actions are thus generated through the MPC scheduler by recedingly solving the OCP online. Note that the transient dynamics of local controllers (i.e., response speed and overshoot) are not modeled due to the slow thermal dynamic of thermal appliances. Instead, the central MPC controller takes account of system steady dynamics by the model-based feedback control strategies, i.e., collecting the real-time thermal states of tanks or rooms, forecasting system dynamic responses, and optimizing the binary control inputs in the near-future horizon. The following firstly introduces the key aspects of the general MPC approach. Then, based on the thermal appliance models in Section 3, we design an MPC controller to schedule these thermal appliances proactively for household peak load avoiding, which is illustrated in both explicit and compact form. 3.1 Model predictive control (MPC) approach Consider a general discretized multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) system, the state-space control model in formula (10) is characterized by a state vector variable x k , control vector variable u k and system dynamic equations f . The state and control variables are constrained within feasible domains, X , and U , respectively, and the system dynamic f may be linear or non-linear depending on the studied system. (10) x k + 1 = f ( x k , u k ) Then, the MPC controller works following the four main steps below. (1) At time instant k, the MPC controller measures the system state x k ; (2) Based on x k , the optimal sequence of controls u k ∗ x k = ( u k ∗ , u k + 1 ∗ , ⋯ , u k + H - 1 ∗ ) over a prediction horizon H is obtained by solving an OCP online. The OCP can be formulated as (11) and solved by linear or non-linear programming methods. (11) min u J ( u , x ) = ∑ k = 0 H - 1 ( \u2016 x k - x k r \u2016 Q 2 + \u2016 u k - u k r \u2016 R 2 ) subject to : x k + 1 = f ( x k , u k ) u k ∈ U , ∀ k ∈ [ 0 , H - 1 ] x k ∈ X , ∀ k ∈ [ 0 , H ] where x 0 and u 0 are the current state and control vectors, J(u, x) is the objective function of the OCP over the prediction horizon, x k r and u k r are user-specified parameters representing the reference states, control inputs at time step k, respectively. Q and R are weighting matrices for punishing deviations from reference states and controls, H is the length of prediction horizon, X and U are the feasible domains for the state and control vector variables, respectively; (3) Apply the first optimal control action u k ∗ to the system; (4) Repeat the above steps at the next time step; From the formulation above, it is seen that the MPC approach is a centralized control strategy collecting information from all connected components with the aid of information and communication technology (ICT) and taking advantage of the forecasted future information and newly updated measurement information from each system component. The forecasted future system behavior within the receding window is formulated as an OCP and optimized for optimal control actions. By updating newly measured information as the window receding, the feedback control mechanism relieves the effect of uncertainties. 3.2 Problem formulation of MPC-based thermal appliance scheduling This subsection shows the developed MPC controller in its explicit form for household peak shaving, taken the four appliances (EC, WH, RF, and FZ) as an example. Same as literature [40], this study considered a centralized controller in an ideal situation, where one MPC controller is aware of all appliance models and disturbances, and is able to control all connected appliances. To design such a controller, the whole building, as well as the appliances inside, is modeled as one system. In this system, the control actions include the electric chiller on\u2013off, the water heater on\u2013off, the refrigerator on\u2013off, the freezer on\u2013off. The system model includes the house thermal model with electric chiller, water heater model, refrigerator model, and freezer model. Disturbances to such a system include internal gain, solar gain, outdoor temperature, and hot water demand profiles. These appliances affect each other during the operation. The ability of this centralized controller to affect all connected appliances gives this controller more control flexibility and brings total awareness to the problem. The OCP objective function includes the energy consumption cost, the cost for the deviations from temperature setpoints, the penalties to the violations of the temperature boundaries, and the penalties to the violations of appliance concurrent operation constraint. Two types of slack variables s a n d v are designed to relax temperature boundary constraints and concurrent operation constraints to avoid infeasibility. s is to allow the temperature comfort zone to be violated slightly when necessary, and v is to ensure the comfort zone without being compromised too much and allow operating multiple appliances simultaneously when necessary. In this approach, we assume that a central controller collects the states and future information of each appliance within the time horizon, i.e., electricity prices, weather data, internal gains, and hot water demand. That information can also be obtained using forecasting techniques, which is beyond the scope of this paper. In this paper, it is assumed that the scheduler always obtains perfect forecasts in the simulation. Eq. (12) shows the explicit formulation of such a problem.

T a , T m , T w , T rf , T fz are the state variables representing building indoor air temperature, building mass temperature, water tank temperature, the internal temperature of refrigerator and freezer, respectively. w EC , w w , w rf , w fz are penalty factors for temperature deviations to setpoints, s a , s m , s w , s rf , s fz are slack variables for temperature constraints relaxing. h EC , h w , h rf , h fz are penalty factors for the comfort zone violations. v is the slack variable for the constraint relaxing of concurrent appliance operations. g u - a g g is the penalty factor for the appliance concurrent operations. T i o , Q i s , Q i i , D i demand - W H are exogenous time-varying information representing outdoor temperature, solar gains, internal gains, and hot water usage demand at time step i. As stated before, a household peak load occurs mainly due to the simultaneous operations of multiple high-rate-power appliances. Therefore, the number of simultaneous appliance operations should be minimized to avoid the peak. Since different appliances have different power levels, their contributions to peak load are discounted by normalization and weighting, as shown in equation (13). (13) u agg - w e i g h t e d i = P EC rate P app max · u EC i + P w rate P app max · u w i + P rf rate P app max · u rf i + P fz rate P app max · u fz i u agg - w e i g h t e d i - τ - v i ⩽ 0 , P app max = max ( P EC rate , P w rate , P rf rate , P fz rate ) where the u agg - w e i g h t e d i is the discounted index that evaluates the degree of concurrent operations considering the significance of different appliances to peak forming, P app max is the maximum rated power among four appliances, the τ is the tolerance to concurrent appliance operations, which can be interpreted as the house demand limit by multiplying the maximum appliance power P app max . The discounted sum of appliance operation is constrained below the tolerance τ and gets relaxed by slack variable v . Note that all state variables, control variables, and slack variables are decision variables to be solved in the OCP. 3.3 A compact form for MPC-based thermal appliance scheduling Eq. (14) shows the compact and general form of such a problem. The cost objective function includes four components: cost of control efforts, cost of temperature deviations from user thermostatic setpoint, cost of user comfort zone violations, and cost of concurrent appliance operations. (14) min ∑ i = 1 H p i P T U i · Δ t + ( T i - T i r e f e r ) T w ( T i - T i r e f e r ) + ( ε i u p p e r ) T h u p p e r ε i u p p e r + ( ε i l o w e r ) T h l o w e r ε i l o w e r + g v i subject to: T i + 1 = f ( T i , U i , E i ) η T U i - τ - v i ⩽ 0 , v i ⩾ 0 T i - T i u p p e r - ε i u p p e r ⩽ 0 , ε i u p p e r ⩾ 0 T i l o w e r - T i - ε i l o w e r ⩽ 0 , ε i l o w e r ⩾ 0 where p i is the electricity tariff at the time i, P is the rate power vector of appliances, U i is the binary control vector of all thermal appliances, T i is the temperature vector of all connected thermal appliances at time i, T i refer is the temperature setpoint vector for all appliances at time step i, which is taken as a constant setpoint vector in this study. w is the diagonal weighting matrix punishing the temperature deviations from user setpoints. ε i upper and ε i lower are the relaxing variable vectors for allowing the comfort zone to be violated slightly when necessary. The penalty vectors h upper and h lower compensate these relaxing constraints and therefore prevent considerable violations. v i is the relaxing variable that allows the peak limit to be violated slightly when necessary. g is the weight for punishing the peak limit violations. In the constraints, f is the corresponding thermal dynamic equations, functioned by current temperature vector T i , the control input vector U i , and the external input vector E i . The external input E i may include weather data, occupant demand data, and occupant activities data. η is the weighting factor that characterizes the different significance of appliance operations to peak avoiding. In this study, η is constructed by normalizing the power levels of operating appliances η = P m a x ( P ) . τ is the tolerance to the degree of concurrent appliance operations, which can be interpreted as the peak limit. For example, τ is assumed to be one in this study, which means the house peak limit is set as the maximum appliance power level. T i upper is the upper bound of the user comfort zone, and T i lower is the lower bound of the user's comfort zone. 3.4 Solution approach The MPC controller obtains the ON/OFF control decisions by recedingly solving a set of OCPs. These OCPs can be modeled by different programming languages and solved by invoking mature optimization solvers. This study first modeled the OCPs in MATLAB by the CasADi toolbox, a symbolic framework for the easy and rapid prototype of numerical optimization problems [41]. Since the CasADi optimization tool doesn\u2019t have an interface to mixed-integer quadratic program (MIQP) solvers, the mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP) solver Bonmin [42] is invoked from CasADi for solving OCPs. Bonmin implements a simple branch-and-bound algorithm for MINLPs by solving a continuous nonlinear program (NLP) at each search tree node, branching on integer variables and pruning nodes based on infeasibility, bounds, and integer feasibility. Please refer to [43,44] for more details on the solving approach of general MINLPs. Nevertheless, the nonlinear dynamics of thermal appliances have been linearized by the first-order forward difference approximation method in Section 2.4. The formulations in (13) and (14) are convex MIQP problems with quadratic objective functions and linear constraints. Adopting the MINLP solver induces an unnecessary and intensive computational burden. To lift the computation speed, we again modeled the same OCP problems in Python by the Pyomo package and solved them by invoking the MIQP solver CPLEX. CPLEX implements a similar branch-and-bound algorithm to Bonmin. The main difference is that a quadratic program (QP) is solved at every node of the branch-and-bound tree instead of a general NLP, which is easier to solve. Please refer to [45] for more details on the solving approach of convex MIQPs by CPLEX. A laptop with the following configurations is used for all simulations: Intel(R) Core TM i7-7700HQ CPU @ 2.80 GHz 2.81 GHz, RAM (8 GB), Windows 10 Education. 4 Simulation setup A series of simulations were implemented for different purposes. First, the peak avoiding of the MPC controller was validated in both homogeneous and heterogeneous appliance sets. The on\u2013off controllers serve as the benchmark method. The homogeneous appliance set contains three groups of the same type of appliances (two ECs, five RFs, three WHs), and the heterogenous appliance set contains two appliance groups (four appliances, eight appliances) with all the four types of thermal appliances. For simplification, the identical parameters in Tables 1, 3, 4 were used for the same type of involved appliances, except for their initial temperatures. The base-level control interval is taken as Δ t = 2.5 m i n s , and the penalty factor for avoiding concurrent appliance operations is taken as g = 20 / 200 . Second, the impact of the appliance rated power, the control interval, and the penalty factors g on peak avoiding were investigated by resetting the thermal appliances\u2019 parameters, and the MPC controller parameters taking the electric chiller as an example. Finally, the computational complexity and feasibility of the MPC controller is analyzed by changing the number of connected appliances (n = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) and the length of receding horizons (H = 6, 9, 12 steps), taken refrigerator as an example. The one-iteration computing time of the MPC controller was recorded and compared with the control interval to judge whether the selected receding horizon length and the number of appliances are computationally feasible. Table 5 summarizes the key parameters settings of both the MPC controller and appliances for the series of simulations. 5 Results and discussion This section illustrates the results and relevant discussions for investigating: (1) the effectiveness of MPC-based proactive scheduling method for both homogeneous and heterogenous appliance scheduling in Sections 5.1 and 5.2, (2) the impact of key appliance and controller parameters, such as rated powers, control intervals, penalty factors, in Sections 5.3 and 5.4, (3) the computational complexity and feasibility of the MPC controller in Section 5.5. 5.1 Homogeneous appliance scheduling Different appliances may have different duty cycles and time constants of thermal dynamics. The preferred way is to group appliances into classes and develop MPC controllers for each group of appliances, so-called \u2018homogeneous appliance scheduling.\u2019 This subsection shows the homogeneous appliance scheduling results, including the temperature profiles and corresponding control inputs profiles. Three groups were simulated: (1) two electric chillers, (2) five refrigerators, and (3) three water heaters. Fig. 8 shows the MPC scheduling results for two electric chillers operating at two similar rooms (with initial temperatures of 23.9 ℃ and 21.1 ℃, respectively). Fig. 8(a) plots the indoor air and building mass temperatures of the two rooms in a day. Both indoor air temperatures of two rooms are well controlled within the boundaries. It is observed that building mass temperature (yellow curve) is more smooth than indoor air temperature (green curve) due to its larger heat capacity. The electric chiller is turned on and off when the deviation to temperature setpoint exceeds a certain degree. During the daytime, the electric chiller is switched on/off more frequently due to the higher heat transfer from outdoor temperature and solar radiation. Fig. 8(b) plots the control inputs (red) of two chillers and their aggregated and weighted control input profile (blue) during the day. It is seen that the electric chillers are well scheduled that no concurrent operations happen ( ∀ i , u agg - w e i g h t e d i ≤ 1 ). Due to the high-power level of the electric chiller, the non-concurrent operations of multiple electric chillers could avoid peak load greatly. Fig. 9 shows the MPC scheduling results for five refrigerators with identical parameters (as listed in Table 4) but different initial temperatures (1.85 ℃, 2.85 ℃, 3.85 ℃, 4.85 ℃, 5.85℃, respectively). Fig. 9(a) plots the internal temperatures of five refrigerators and their aggregated and weighted control profile during a day. It is shown that the temperatures are well-controlled near to the setpoint 4 ℃ and within the boundaries, and the aggregated control input states do not exceed one representing that no more than one refrigerator\u2019s compressor is in operation at any time. Compared with the result of the on\u2013off control in Fig. 6, the temperature control performance of the MPC controller is much better, with fewer deviations to setpoints than the on\u2013off controller. Fig. 9(b) shows the zoom-view of their control inputs (red) and aggregated and weighted control profile (blue) during the first two hours of a day. It is seen that a refrigerator\u2019s compressor operates for no more than five times in the first two hours, while in Fig. 6, a refrigerator\u2019s compressor operates only three times in the first two hours. The reason behind it is that the deviations to temperature setpoints are mainly affected by the switching frequency. Unlike electric chiller, the modeling for refrigerator or freezer does not consider external input disturbances. Therefore, the temperature profiles of refrigerators are piece-linear and periodic with equal duty cycles during the day. Fig. 10 shows the MPC scheduling results for three water heaters with identical parameters, different initial temperatures, and different hot water demands. In Fig. 10(a), the temperatures remain near to the setpoints and within the boundaries. Due to the forecasting-based control strategy, the water heaters always turn on before the hot water demand happens and increase the water temperatures in advance. Compared to the on\u2013off controller, the deviations to temperature setpoints of the MPC controller are also smaller with more frequent switching. In Fig. 10(b), the aggregated control input profile reveals that no concurrent appliance operations happen during the day. 5.2 Heterogeneous appliance scheduling Privacy concerns may arise when the MPC collects information from appliances that may be owned by different households. Thus, the coordination of heterogeneous thermal appliances in a central home controller is more practical. A centralized MPC controller can be deployed in a smart home using a wireless network to collect information from all connected appliances. For a household with several different types of thermal appliances (e.g., electric chiller, water heater, refrigerator, and freezer), we assume each of them is connected to the central home controller with bidirectional information links and is equipped with a control actuator. Those appliances send real-time temperature measurements to the central controller and receive control commands from the controller. Their dynamic equations are assumed to be known-prior and coded in the central controller. Fig. 11 shows the coordination results of four thermal appliances. All temperature curves stay within the user comfort zones, as shown in Fig. 11(a). Fig. 11(b) shows the control input profiles, with \u20180\u2019 and \u20181\u2019 representing the on and off states. Since these four thermal appliances have different rated powers, we weight their significance to load avoiding by normalization. As shown in the uagg-weighted curve in Fig. 11(b), the uagg-weighted values may be slightly larger than one. This means that slight appliance concurrent operations are allowed. For example, since the power levels of the refrigerator and freezer are relatively low (135 W) and the power levels of the electric chiller and water heater are relatively high (5 kW and 4.5 kW, respectively). The electric chiller and water heater are not allowed to operate simultaneously as they may generate a peak as high as 9.5 kW. In contrast, the refrigerator and freezer could operate simultaneously with the electric chiller or water heater when necessary. They have little impact on the formulation of peak loads. Fig. 11(c) shows the resultant aggregated power curves under on\u2013off control (blue) and MPC control (red) strategies for four thermal appliances. It is seen that a peak reduction of 4.5 kW is achieved by coordinating the operations of the electric chiller and water heater. It is inspired that the thermal inertia of buildings can be used for pre-cooling or pre-heating the buildings not only before the occupant comes in but also be used for pre-cooling or pre-heating before the other high load occurs. For example, the building indoor air can be pre-cooled before the hot water demand, and the other high loads come, or delay-cooled until the other high loads finish. Fig. 12 shows the coordination results of eight thermal appliances. Similarly, all temperatures are well controlled within the comfort zones, as shown in Fig. 12(a). It is interesting that the average air temperatures of both rooms go up gradually to the upper-temperature limit, and the average water temperatures of both heaters go down gradually to the lower temperature limit from 11:00 to 18:00. In contrast, the average temperatures of refrigerators and freezers remain stable around their setpoints. This is accountable since the solar gains and outdoor temperatures are relatively high from 11:00 to 18:00, and the comfort levels of room air and water temperature are compromised slightly to avoid concurrent operations of these high-rate-power appliances as much as possible. Since the rated powers of refrigerators and freezers are low, their concurrency with other appliances does not matter to the peak load. Fig. 12(c) shows the resultant aggregated power curves under on\u2013off control (blue) and MPC control (red) strategies for eight thermal appliances. A maximum peak reduction of 14 kW is achieved by replacing the local on\u2013off controller with the MPC controller. Though the electric chillers\u2019 concurrent operations are unavoidable during the 11:00\u201318:00, the peak load in the morning and evening period are avoided. Meantime, the electricity consumption from 11:00 to 18:00 is more regular, concentrated, and predictable, which can be used to balance the PV output power (if available). 5.3 Impact of control interval, appliance rate power on peak avoiding It is found that different control intervals and appliance specifications can lead to different peak avoiding performance. This subsection investigates the impact of appliance rate powers and control intervals on peak avoiding, taken two electric chillers as an example. The third row of Table 5 listed six simulation cases with different control intervals and power levels, and other parameters are held constant, e.g., g = 200. Figs. 13\u201315 plot the scheduling results of cases 1\u20133, whose control intervals are 2.5 min. Comparing their temperature profiles, electric chillers with higher rated powers have larger temperature variations as they remove more heat from houses to outside at one control interval. However, though their temperature profile is not that smooth, the electric chillers with high rated powers could always maintain the indoor temperature within the comfort zones. Instead, with the decrease of rated powers, their average temperature deviations to thermostat setpoints become significant, especially in the mid-afternoon. When the rated power decreases to five kilowatts, the temperatures drift outside the boundaries, as shown in Fig. 15(a). Comparing their control input profiles, the alternately switching of two electric chillers could effectively avoid their simultaneous operations when their rated powers are high enough, as shown in Fig. 13(b) and 14(b). As the power decreases to five kilowatts, there exist several time intervals when the two electric chillers need to operate simultaneously. However, the temperatures still drift outside the boundary even the two electric chillers operate simultaneously. The temperature drift and concurrent operations are mainly due to the high solar gains and outdoor temperatures during the mid-afternoon, as shown in Fig. 4(a). Figs. 16\u201318 plots the scheduling results of cases 4\u20136 when we increased the control interval from 2.5 min to five minutes. A larger control interval means a larger minimum operation time of electric chiller and a larger cooling supply at each control step. Compared with cases 1\u20133, cases 4\u20136 have more significant temperature variations during one operating interval. Similar to cases 1\u20133, the appliance rated powers have major impacts on the temperature and control input profiles. With the decreasing of rated powers, the temperatures tend to drift outside the comfort zones, and some concurrent operations of two electric chillers are emerging during the mid-afternoon when the solar gains and outdoor temperatures achieve their peaks. Compared case 6 with case 3, the larger control interval in case 6 brings smaller average temperature deviations but more concurrent operations from 13:00 to 17:00. In summary, increasing the appliance rated powers could help ensure the room temperatures stay within the occupant's comfort zones while avoiding two electric chillers operating simultaneously. However, increasing appliance rated powers could raise the overall power profile levels and offset the benefit of avoiding concurrent operations. Thus, the appliance specification should be properly selected before implementing such MPC controllers. For example, case 2 is preferred compared with case 1 and 3 due to its modest power level and smoother power curves. Besides, increasing the control intervals could increase the cooling supply of each electric chiller at one interval and relieve the real-time computing requirement. However, it also brings higher temperature deviations and side effects on the stability of the forward difference approximation method. In our experiments, the first-order forward difference approximation method became unstable as the control interval increases to 10 min, as shown in Fig. 19 . If a larger control interval is expected, the discretization method has to be changed, such as the more time-consuming implicit backward difference method. Besides, though some concurrent operations happen, the MPC-based scheduling is still meaningful as it avoids some unnecessary concurrency in the morning or evening and makes the peak load more predictable. By introducing the PV panel, these unavoidable concurrent operations could be compensated by the PV output power. Note that the control interval equals the minimum ON and OFF time of the EC unit. The applied control intervals (2.5 min and 5 min) are comparative to the existing studies. In [18], the HVAC unit is required to operate for at least 3 min after being turned on while wait for at least 5 min to be turned on again after being turned off. In [46], it is mentioned that the compressor time delay for residential houses typically ranges between 3 and 10 min. 5.4 Impact of weight factors on peak avoiding The MPC controller inherits the disadvantage of the MPC approach that the penalty parameters have to be determined through trial and error. In practice, users may have different comfort sensitivity to different thermal appliances. For example, an individual might feel more uncomfortable when the room air temperature exceeds the upper limit by 1 ° C than when water heater temperature exceeds the upper limit by 1 ° C . The compromise between user comfort and peak avoiding is also dependent on personal preference. Thus, the parameters may be tuned to accommodate the preferences difference. In our study, the determination of weight matrices is straightforward. w and h are identical matrices, and weight g is taken as a large enough value, for example, 20. The g value determines the user\u2019s willingness to sacrifice thermal comfort for peak load avoiding. Fig. 20 illustrates the temperature and control input profiles with different g values. It shows that the g values determine the trade-off between temperature comfort violations and the electric chillers\u2019 concurrent operations. When g equals ten, the indoor air temperature curve (green one in Fig. 20(a)) stayed within the comfort zone, but more concurrent operations were observed from 10:00 to 18:00 (green one in Fig. 20(b)). As the g value increases to 200, the average indoor air temperature drifts from 23 °C to 28 °C from 12:00 to 18:00 (purple one in Fig. 20(a)), but only a few concurrent operations were observed from 15:00 to 17:00 (purple one in Fig. 20(b)). Therefore, the g values are related to the trade-off control between peak avoiding and thermal comfort for different preferences. 5.5 Computational complexity In theory, the MPC controller is feasible only when the control interval is larger than the computing time of a single control step. The control interval is a trade-off between computing time and discretization accuracy. While the computing time of a single control step is dependent on the number of optimization variables, which is determined by the connected appliances and the length of receding horizons. This subsection discusses the feasibility (whether the computing time of a single step is less than the control interval) under different configurations. For simulations of homogenous appliance set in section 5.1, the control interval is set as 150 s, and the control horizons are set as six steps (15 min). The average MPC computing time for a single step is always less than the control interval of 150 s. For simulations of heterogenous appliance set in section 5.2, the control interval is 150 s, and the control horizons are set as six steps. The MPC controller with four appliances needs 146 s on average to compute the single-step control decision. However, this value increases to 1135 s when the MPC controller controls eight thermal appliances. Then, the feasibility with a different number of refrigerators (N = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) and horizon lengths (H = 6, 9, 12 steps) is tested. The control interval is five minutes, and the receding horizons are a half-hour, forty-five minutes, and one hour, respectively. Table 6 summarizes the average MPC computing time when adopting the general MINLP solver for a single step. The feasibility condition is satisfied for short horizons with a modest number of refrigerators, as shown in bold in Table 6. For a long horizon like one hour, the computing time is increased dramatically than that of a half-hour time horizon. It is expected that a longer horizon could increase the appliance's operational flexibility and improve peak-avoiding performance. Meanwhile, the longer horizon means more optimization variables and requires more computational power. In practice, a trade-off between computing efficiency and peak-avoiding performance needs to be made. Another method to lift the computational speed is to select proper optimization solvers. As stated in Section 3.5, the OCPs in (13) and (14) are MIQP problems that the specific MIQP solver CPLEX can solve. Table 7 shows the average MPC computing time for single steps when adopting the specific MIQP solver to the same simulations of Table 6. A significant reduction in computational time is observed, and the feasibility condition is satisfied for all configurations, as shown in bold in Table 7. This further validates the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed proactive scheduling method for peak avoiding. Then, we tested the computational performance of the MIQP solution approach for heterogeneous appliance sets (multiple houses). The computational time comparison between MINLP and MIQP solution approaches is given in Table 8 . A significant computational speedup is also observed by adopting the MIQP solver. However, the centralized MPC controller is still not scalable to multiple houses even though the efficient MIQP solver has been adopted. In summary, the time horizon of six-step is large enough for the scheduling of these periodic time-driven thermal appliances in a single household scenario for both MINLP and MIQP solution approaches. The computational time is significantly reduced by replacing the MINLP solver with a MIQP solver for the same OCPs. Thus the number of connected appliances and the length of receding horizons can be further increased. However, the deployment of such a centralized MPC controller is still impractical for multiple houses at the system level due to the high computational requirement. Increasing the control interval is a possible way to reduce the computational requirement. However, the accuracy of the difference approximation method would decrease. Besides, it is found that the forward difference approximation method would become unstable when the control interval increases to 10 min. Significant model reductions and ICT-enabled decentralized MPC formulation should be important research directions in the future. 6 Conclusion and future development This paper develops an MPC-based bottom-up intra-hour proactive scheduling method for house-level peak load avoiding, considering user comfort. First, a physics-based approach is applied to model the dynamics of four kinds of thermal appliances. Second, an ideal centralized MPC controller is designed to coordinate the on\u2013off states of these appliances to minimize concurrent operations without sacrificing user comfort. Online OCPs are formulated to determine the binary control decisions over the receding horizon by mixed-integer programming solvers. We take account of the contributions of different appliances to peak load by normalizing and weighting over their power levels. By minimizing the sum of the discounted appliance control decisions, the formulation of house peak load is avoided as much as possible. Third, the MPC controller is applied to homogenous and heterogenous appliance sets. Simulation results validated significant peak reductions and good performance in avoiding concurrent appliance operation. Finally, the impacts of control intervals, appliance rate powers, and penalty factors on peak avoiding performance are analyzed. The computational complexity issues are discussed and compared between two alternative solution approaches. We conclude that the developed MPC controller is feasible in a small-scale household scenario but not practical to deploy at the system level. The OCPs are convex mixed-integer quadratic program (MIQP) problems. Replacing a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP) solver with a MIQP solver could significantly reduce the computational burden. The followings are several valuable findings. (1) The forecasting-based control strategy could help exploit the thermal inertia of thermal appliances. The benefit of \u2018pre-cooling\u2019 or \u2018pre-heating\u2019 of the HVAC system in office buildings has been well-recognized. It predicts the arrival time of occupants and applies rule-based control to operate the system in the early morning before the first peak period comes the morning. We extend the \u2018pre-cooling\u2019 or \u2018pre-heating\u2019 strategies to all thermal appliances and the whole day. Every thermal appliance can take pre-cooling, delay-cooling, pre-heating, or delay-heating strategies to shift operations proactively to minimize concurrent operations without sacrificing user comfort. These thermal appliances interact with each other and operate with demand priorities. Their priorities are dependent on the rated power levels and the users\u2019 references. For example, the MPC controller could forecast the hot water demand and take pre-heating actions to avoid concurrency with other high loads and meantime satisfy the hot water usage. The controller may also delay the water heating when the temperature lies within comfort zones or the occupant is willing to violate the comfort zones slightly to reduce house peak load. (2) The bottom-up proactive scheduling method could avoid peak load at the residential level and bring assurance to demand profile shaping without using time-varying tariffs. Compared with top-down control strategies, the impact of time lag and uncertainties are relieved. And there is no need to reshape the electricity tariff or determine the DLC command with concerns of load bouncing effect. The proposed method could avoid some unnecessary concurrency in the morning or evening and make the peak load more predictable. Thus, it can increase the PV self-consumption rate and cost reductions when the house is equipped with a limited capacity of BIPV. Besides, compared with the uncoordinated on\u2013off control, the MPC-based controller could achieve better temperature controls (i.e., water heater) and avoid unnecessary appliance concurrent operations. The main concern is the computational scalability issue. Simulation results show that the feasibility is dependent on the control interval, the number of connected appliances, and the length of the receding horizon. The six-step receding horizon is proper for scheduling major thermal appliances in a small-scale household scenario. However, the system-level deployment of our MPC controller is impractical due to the high computational requirement. Besides, the increased switching actions have a side impact on physical systems, which should be thoroughly investigated before deploying it in practice. The transient phases between active and inactive states of thermal appliances may also make a difference. Further research efforts can emphasize three directions: (1) mining and forecasting the occupant demands or appliance usage habits in the buildings, (2) designing scalable control strategies for system-level peak shaving, and (3) decentralized MPC controller design with field tests.

        "dc:description": "Residential-level peak shaving is beneficial for the supply\u2013demand balance of buildings with a limited power capacity of renewable energy sources like building-integrated photovoltaics. Thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs) are recognized as flexible resources for peak shaving. In practice, most thermal appliances are controlled by local on\u2013off controllers without any communication and coordination. Multiple appliances may operate simultaneously and produce load peaks. Existing studies assume the existence of an electricity market and time-varying tariffs, which are not always available. This paper developed a model predictive control (MPC) based bottom-up proactive method to leverage the thermal inertia of residential thermal appliances for avoiding household peak load without relying on time-varying tariffs. First, we used a physics-based modeling approach to model the thermal dynamics of several residential thermal devices. Then, we designed a centralized MPC controller to minimize the appliance concurrent operations considering occupant comfort zones and appliance rate powers. Consequently, the house peak load is reduced by minimizing concurrent operations. Simulations over homogenous and heterogenous appliance set validated that the MPC-based proactive scheduling method can effectively reduce household peak load without compromising user comfort too much. Finally, we discussed the impact of control interval, appliance rated powers, and penalty factors on peak avoiding and the computational feasibility of the MPC controller. We concluded that the MPC-based proactive scheduling is feasible and effective for a limited number of thermal appliances with short horizons (i.e., six-step). Replacing a mixed-integer nonlinear program solver with a mixed-integer quadratic program solver could significantly reduce the computational burden. However, the application of the MPC controller to multiple households at the system level is still impractical. Further research efforts are emphasized, like mining and forecasting occupant demand and appliance usage patterns in households and designing scalable control strategies for system-level peak shaving.",
