Model-based predictive control (MPC) has been promoted as a software-based energy saving approach for buildings since the 2000s. However, there has not been significant industry adoption of MPC using current approaches. This paper proposes and tests an approach to MPC using rule extraction (RE) that can be easily implemented in building controllers to override sub-optimal control. The resulting decision trees could be implemented by building control programmers to save energy when ambient conditions are predicted to satisfy the thermal requirements of the spaces. A detailed MPC algorithm using inverse models was implemented in 27 rooms of an institutional building to provide data for a classification learning approach. Cooling and heating season decision trees were generated based on the inputs and outputs of the detailed MPC algorithm. An ensemble and sample randomization were used to generalize the trees across rooms and prevent overfitting to individual rooms. Cooling season MPC and RE energy savings were 42% and 27% respectively and heating season MPC and RE energy savings were 18% and 33% respectively. Both algorithms also reduced the difference between the temperature setpoint and measured indoor air temperature compared to the reactive controls. Keywords Model-based predictive control Energy use Classification learning Simplified control Field implementation 1 Introduction Model-based predictive control (MPC) has demonstrated the potential to save up to 50% of heating and cooling energy in commercial buildings by preventing overheating and overcooling through the use of thermal mass [1,2]. The goal of this paper is to provide a simplified and experimentally evaluated approach to MPC utilizing rule extraction (RE) from a detailed MPC algorithm to generate a Boolean logic-based simplified algorithm. The simplified algorithm can be mapped to thresholds of physical inputs and implemented by building automation system (BAS) contractors. Numerous studies have been conducted to evaluate the energy saving potential of MPC. Many of these were simulation-based studies rather than physical experiments, and therefore these did not examine the impact of disturbances and uncontrolled conditions [3-7]. At least 11 experimental and in-situ studies have been conducted with promising results reflecting the previous claim of up to 50% energy savings [8-18]. Despite this effort, there has still been minimal commercial adoption of predictive controls [19]. Applied, simplified approaches are sparse within the experimental subset of the literature on predictive controls. Gunay et al. adapted a detailed MPC algorithm for recursive parameter estimation within a BACnet BAS controller environment [20]. Noted limitations of most commercial BAS controllers in Gunay's work are the inability to perform matrix operations and low physical memory for program code storage and intermediate variable storage. It is also stated that the hardware limitations of BAS controllers significantly limit the algorithm complexity that can be programmed directly into controller databases. Remote reading and writing of controller commands to a computer that can perform detailed MPC calculations can also pose operational and safety risks due to the need for a constant network connection. Classification learning has been used to identify combinations of physical input thresholds for control outcomes in the form of RE from detailed MPC [21]. May-Ostendorp's approach was applied to a mixed-mode building simulation, and later extended to a test in a controlled and instrumented climate controlled chamber [22]. Bursill et al. adapted this approach for experimental application to the existing BAS of a single multi-occupant office, but cited the need for a larger set of offices to verify the effectiveness of simplified MPC at reducing energy use [23]. The importance of large quantities of data to validate classification approaches is further highlighted by Coffey et al. [5], where simulation was used to develop optimal control rules for a modelled building stock in the form of a lookup table. Ambiguity of the practical energy savings of both MPC and RE control in real buildings is a concern when advocating for predictive controls. Few mechanically ventilated facilities demonstrate the control and measurement capability to implement real-time MPC and validate the energy use of multiple thermal zones. Herrick Labs at Purdue University has extensive instrumentation to monitor occupants and the air supply system, with a focus on occupant and indoor environment quality studies [24]. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory's Research Support Facility is another commercial building with in-situ research applications, largely in occupant comfort and net-zero energy [25]. The Canadian National Research Council's Canadian Centre for Housing Technology research facility contains several highly instrumented residential buildings that can measure supplied energy from heating and cooling systems [26]. FLEXLAB at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory can evaluate the energy efficiency of major building systems as an integrated system under real-world conditions [27]. The Health Sciences Building at Carleton University contains 25 offices with the ability to measure supplied terminal hydronic heating, lighting, and plug loads at the room level [28]. A gap in the literature is addressed in this paper by combining advanced control algorithms (MPC), simplified predictive approaches (RE), in-situ application and testing, and room-level measurement into a comprehensive study. Prior to this study there has not been a documented application of RE control to multiple rooms within an actively occupied building. The novelty of this work is in both the field implementation approach and the scale of the field implementation itself. In contrast to previous studies which typically looked at entire buildings or single rooms [16,29-38], this study used a much larger sample of 27 offices, thus increasing confidence of the results. First, this paper describes the test facility and instrumentation uncertainty. Second, it develops a methodology for zone-level MPC and adapt it to zone-level RE control. Third, it quantifies the energy use savings of each algorithm when applied at the zone-level using in-situ approaches in an occupied building. Finally, it provides an evaluation of the relative effectiveness of RE compared to detailed MPC and the original reactive control of the building. 2 Methodology This methodology describes the experimental facility, measurement uncertainty, detailed MPC algorithm, workflow to generate simplified RE decision trees to emulate the detailed MPC, and the formulation of energy use to compare the performance of the respective algorithms. A high-level overview of the procedure for implementing the MPC and RE control is provided in Fig. 1 . 2.1 Description of Facility Control algorithms were compared using 27 rooms contained within 11 thermal zones distributed between two similar floors in an institutional building in Ottawa, Canada. The primary façade of the rooms is oriented 30 degrees North of East as shown in Fig. 2 . Twenty-five of the measured and controlled rooms are single occupant private offices and two are kitchenettes that are used as communal spaces. Each office is the same size and shape, and has the same sensors and variable air volume (VAV) diffuser location and orientation. VAV units are shared between 2-4 offices depending on the location and floor. The kitchenettes have different floor areas than the offices and each other, and each have dedicated VAV units. The VAV terminal units are equipped with hot water reheat coils and the rooms have floor mounted hot water radiant heating panels near the windows as shown in Fig. 3 . The corner rooms (two kitchenettes and two offices, one of each per floor) have larger window to wall ratios than the other rooms (0.8 compared to 0.4). The reactive control was implemented during construction by the controls contractor using the sequence of operation documents. When heating or cooling are required, the reactive control modulates the VAV damper to adjust the airflow to each zone to meet the air requirement of the room with the greatest thermal demand in the zone. In the heating season the radiant heater is modulated to a maximum temperature drop (inlet to outlet) of 5°C. The room air setpoint can be adjusted by the occupants of each room via the thermostat and can vary from 18°C to 24°C. All room setpoints were reset weekly at midnight on Monday morning by the original controls if they deviated by more than 2°C from the seasonal setpoints (21°C in the heating season and 23°C in the cooling season). The air side control has multiple rooms per zone, while the hydronic radiant heating has only one office per unit. The combination of grouped room air side zone control and individual room setpoint adjustability can yield situations where meeting the setpoint of all rooms is unlikely. The VAV box also provides the outdoor air supply requirement and is active on a schedule from 7:00AM to 7:00PM supplying an average of 1,700 L/s to the entire office group when active (and no airflow to the offices when inactive). The floor-level air handling unit (AHU) operates 24 hours per day every day of the week because it also supplies lab spaces. Due to the large amount of exhaust air from the lab spaces the outdoor air fraction was greater than 0.9 for most of the data acquisition period to maintain building pressurization for fume hoods. A complete list of the sensors used in this study and the corresponding instrumentation error is provided in Table 1 . A diagram of a typical room with sensor and heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) equipment locations is provided in Fig. 3. To represent a realistic case for the proposed algorithms the baseline control was not modified in the reactive offices. Existing control was only modified for MPC and RE testing by the insertion of a binary variable before the final output of the existing reactive control programming for overrides in the MPC and RE offices. While the baseline reactive control predated and was likely not compliant to ASHRAE Guideline 36 (High-Performance Sequences of Operation for HVAC Systems) [39], researchers were involved when the controls were defined and design effort was made to reduce energy use (e.g., automated blinds that open and close at night to conserve thermal energy, seasonal setpoint deadbands, nighttime setbacks). Ethics approval was obtained for the logging and usage of room-level data in the measured building. Continuous data (e.g., temperature) was sampled at 5-minute intervals and binary data (e.g., window opening) was sampled when events occurred. Binary values from passive infrared occupancy sensors were used to infer occupancy and accompanying loads (e.g., lighting and plug in equipment) as suggested in the literature [11]. 2.2 Uncertainty Analysis A separation of variables approach was used to quantify aggregate instrumentation uncertainty of energy use estimation in this study [40]. The thermistors had instrumentation uncertainty of 0.2°C. Bias due to thermistor positioning at the wall and not the center of the room was not quantified but is acknowledged to induce additional error. The differential pressure transducers had instrumentationerrors of 1% of full scale (2.5 Pa), corresponding to an average of 30 L/s per room. Room-level maximum airflow rates ranged from 61 L/s to 140 L/s. Air side sensible cooling and heating energy estimates were found to have errors of 32% of the average values using Eq. (1), where s is the aggregate uncertainty, Q is the energy quantity being assessed for uncertainty, x is the input variable, i is the index of the input variable, and n is the number of input variables required to derive the energy quantity. Precision error, Δsp , and instrumentation error, Δsb , are added vectorially in Eq. (2) to estimate the total measurement uncertainty. The aggregate precision error of the air side sensible cooling and heating energy estimates was found to be 7.0% of the average value of air side sensible cooling and heating energy. Hydronic aggregate instrumentation error of radiant heating energy estimates was found to be 13.7% of the average value. Precision error in the hydronic case was negligible (less than 0.1%). Analog to digital conversion values of 4096 were standard for all inputs on the BAS. The largest source of measurement uncertainty was from the air side pressure transducer, where instrumentation errors of 1% full scale were reported by the manufacturer. Despite the high instrumentation errors from manufacturer data, spot measurements found an average airflow error of 4.0% of the measured values corresponding to an aggregate heating energy estimate error of 9.0%. The previously introduced errors are summarized in Table 2 .

The predictive control objectives were accomplished by minimizing energy use and setpoint deviation using a cost function described in the Model Development section. The following sections describe the test plan, model development, and control strategy for the MPC algorithm. 2.3.1 Test plan One month of preliminary sensor data was collected from the BAS serving the offices to train and validate inverse models for predicting future office indoor air temperatures in the MPC algorithm. Following detailed MPC testing, classification learning was used to extract rules for RE control and testing. Floor-level algorithms were alternated on a weekly basis as shown in Table 3 . Under this testing plan effects from outdoor environment conditions and occupant behavioural effects on floor-level energy use are minimized. The fraction of time with at least one occupant is the portion of time when the ceiling motion detector senses movement, where 0.24 is the equivalent of a 40-hour work week. An average of 0.042 was found over the entire testing period for all rooms, corresponding to seven hours per week. These offices were primarily occupied by professors with significant lecture and meeting obligations, explaining the low occupancy ratios. Additionally, many of the rooms had weeks where they were only entered briefly by the cleaning staff, bringing down the average from more regularly occupied rooms. 2.3.2 Model development (3) J = ( S P − T ) T ( S P − T ) + Δ U T R Δ U Detailed MPC was executed using a control agent to determine the result of the cost function in Eq. (3), where J is the cost (an arbitrary and differentiable constant in this study), SP is the temperature setpoint provided by the occupant, T is the air temperature as observed by the BAS and predicted using modelling, ΔU is the energy input from the heating and cooling system, and R is a matrix of penalty weights for different time-steps within the prediction horizon adapted from Wang et al. [41]. The control agent collects system input and output data to determine what actions to take. A prediction horizon of two to three hours was found to be appropriate for buildings without large amounts of thermal mass, therefore a prediction horizon of three hours was chosen in this study [31,42]. The VAV damper positions and VAV reheat coil valves were controlled by the MPC in the cooling season, and the VAV damper positions, VAV reheat coil valve positions, and radiant heater valve positions were controlled in the heating season. In Eq. (3), the weight matrix R was set as the identity matrix and was intended to provide a compromise between maintaining the setpoint and minimizing energy use for all prediction steps. Weight matrices may need to be adjusted in cases where time of use rates are applicable or there is any other reason to explicitly shift cooling and heating from one time-step to another. Time of use energy price rates were not considered in this study because the energy provided to the building was not subject to them, thus reducing the importance of adjusting the weights of the R matrix and improving the simplicity of the detailed MPC in this study. The linear time-invariant (LTI) state-space thermal model form used for the spaces shown in Eq. (4), where t is the time-step index, u is the input array, and A and B are the constants for each respective space. State-space parameters were found using the MATLAB system identification toolbox which utilizes a subspace method [43]. States and inputs were constrained by the limits of the sensor readings and equipment capacities. The parameter values of A and B were unconstrained. Because LTI state space models were used, the models must be retrained when input ranges change significantly (e.g., seasonal transition, significant furniture addition or removal, envelope upgrade) to maintain prediction accuracy and account for differing environmental and occupant conditions. Unique LTI state-space models were used for each room and for the cooling and heating seasons to account for changing boundary conditions and to improve the accuracy of the linear models (which are modelling highly nonlinear physical processes). The input array for the model selected in this study consisted of five sensors from Table 1 adapted based on recommendations in the literature, where u 1 is the room ceiling illuminance in lux, u 2 is the VAV air side input, u 3 is the outdoor air temperature (OAT), u 4 is the occupancy state, and u 5 is the radiant panel valve position [11,23,42]. The VAV air side input (u 2) was calculated using Eq. (5) where VVAV is the air flow rate, T VAV1 is the VAV supply air temperature, and T VAV2 is the VAV return air temperature. Eq. (4) expands to Eq. (6) when considering the five model inputs in this study. The ceiling illuminance sensor was used as a proxy for the solar gains of the space because building envelope surface irradiation correlates with ceiling illuminance, and the rooms studied each had illuminance sensors available [23]. Solar gains were relatively low because of the orientation and size of the windows, and it is acknowledged this approach might not work for highly glazed spaces. The use of illuminance sensors as a solar proxy was also found convenient and practical by Gunay et al., and was confirmed by Bursill et al. [31,42]. The state-space model inputs were chosen based on the past success of other zone-level MPC studies with similar objectives [20,23,28,42]. (4) T ( t + 1 ) = A T ( t ) + B u ( t ) (5) u 2 ( t ) = V V A V ( t ) ( T V A V 1 ( t ) − T V A V 2 ( t ) ) (6) T ( t + 1 ) = AT ( t ) + B 1 u 1 ( t ) + B 2 u 2 ( t ) + B 3 u 3 ( t ) + B 4 u 4 ( t ) + B 5 u 5 ( t ) The predictive algorithm used the previously developed indoor air temperature (IAT) models and local weather station predictions. Hourly weather predictions were updated at six-hour intervals for illuminance (converted from solar radiation, used as a solar proxy) and outdoor air temperature prediction from data provided by the CanMETEO program developed by NRCan [44]. The predicted incident solar radiation on the wall from CanMETEO was adjusted to an equivalent illuminance (lux) value using a linear fit to two weeks of hourly data (validated with an additional two weeks of data). The R2 values comparing recorded predictions to estimated values from the linear fits ranged from 0.27 to 0.72 for the cooling season and 0.17 to 0.48 for the heating season for the measured rooms. Both the site observations and CanMETEO predictions use different sensors in different orientations to measure different quantities, thus significant error was anticipated. Despite the low R2 value between the solar irradiation and illuminance predictions, these fits are considered adequate for this application due to the cost and difficulty of installing surface irradiation sensors in most commercial buildings and the proxy usage of this inferred value. Using the MAE of the illuminance fits in the state-space models yielded an average sensitivity of 0.06°C. Degradation of the line fit can be attributed to differing shade positions, physical quantities, and local solar conditions between the airport weather station and building location (approximately 8km apart) among the previously described factors. The heating season fits were worse than the cooling season fits which could be attributed to solar geometry and dynamic reflective conditions from local snow properties introducing additional nonlinearity [45]. The timing of first occupant arrival and last occupant departure events were predicted recursively using logistic regression as described in Gunay et al. [46]. Arrival and departure events were assumed to be Gaussian for the applied model. The occupied schedule was predicted as the mean first arrival minus 1.5 standard deviations to the mean last departure plus 1.5 standard deviations. This accounts for roughly 90% of all arrivals and departures and is a conservative schedule estimate under the Gaussian assumption. A sample predicted schedule for a room is provided in Fig. 4 , where the standard deviations of the arrival and departure times are 0.42 and 2.64 hours respectively. The time between the estimated arrival and departure times on weekdays was assumed to be occupied without absences or breaks in the prediction algorithm as the input to future time-step iterations of u 4 in Eq. (6). Only a weekday schedule was generated for each room because the weekends were assumed to be unoccupied by both the building VAV schedule and this study (and were verified to have significantly lower occupancy ratios than the weekdays). 2.3.3 Control strategy Control decisions to override reactive control operation during MPC testing were sent to the BAS controllers based on the energy balance of Eq. (7), a differentiation and rearrangement of Eq. (3) [41]. Eq. (7) introduces φ, which is expanded in Eq. (8), and H, a grouping of terms that remain nearly constant [20]. The MPC algorithm is applied to each room with unique state-space parameters and illuminance fits for each room. The setpoint logic with a three-step (1.5 hours) control horizon is applied in Fig. 5 , where the zero or one output of the MPC algorithm is be used to determine whether cooling or heating should be provided to each individual room. The Δ U ( t + n ) term in Fig. 5 represents the energy required to reach the setpoint at time t plus time-step n, where a summation of three time-steps occurs over the control horizon to predict the heating or cooling needs of the space. A one in Fig. 5 indicates the HVAC equipment should operate normally, and a zero indicates it should stop operating to reduce setpoint overshoot. A control horizon of half of the prediction horizon was chosen as a compromise between receding horizon control (one time-step) and using all prediction steps in the control horizon. Multi-room zones were controlled such that if more than one room in the zone was predicted to have a controllable deviation from the setpoint when running the MPC algorithm (e.g., if the setpoint was 1°C below the setpoint in the heating season for two of three rooms in a zone and at the setpoint in the third room), the HVAC system outputs would be allowed to operate using the base reactive control loops in a \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d format. In cases where one room or less were predicted to require conditioning (e.g., if the setpoint was 1°C below the setpoint in the heating season for one of three rooms in a zone and at the setpoint in the other two rooms), the HVAC system outputs were overridden for the VAV unit to prevent predicted setpoint overshoot. The effect of this zone control adjustment when using the MPC and RE algorithms is discussed based on differences in actuator commands in the Control mode operational comparison section. During the heating season, room-level radiant heaters were controlled based on room-level MPC algorithm outputs that did not require a multi-room zoning approach. In this study the carbon dioxide levels were monitored (but not controlled) and verified to have not exceeded 1000 ppm for more than 30 minutes at a time. (7) Δ U = ( φ T φ + R ) − 1 φ T ( S P − T ) = H ( S P − T ) (8) φ nxn = [ 1 0 0 0 0 0 A 1 0 0 0 0 A 2 A 1 0 0 0 A 3 A 2 A 1 0 0 A 4 A 3 A 2 A 1 0 A 5 A 4 A 3 A 2 A 1 ] The previously described components of the control agent in the detailed MPC approach were interfaced with the BAS using the workflow in Fig. 6 . Data is read from the BAS inputs and outputs, and processed overrides are written back to the BAS for each room. BACnet data is converted to and from comma delimited files (csv) using Python scripts with BACnet stack commands. Weather prediction data is provided by CanMETEO in comma delimited format. All comma delimited data is read by the agnostic control engine (ACE) and processed for predictive control based on the previously described algorithm. For this study MATLAB was used as the ACE, but in the workflow of Fig. 6 any programming environment that can read and write from comma delimited files can be used. The equations of the Detailed model predictive control development section are applied to the BAS data, their results are processed by the logic in Fig. 5, and the equations and logic are embedded in the ACE and interface with the building controllers (and reactive control sequences) via the paths in Fig. 6. The resulting detailed MPC calculations and workflow are complicated and unreliable for large scale implementation by practitioners and are the motivation for developing a simpler rule extraction approach. 2.4 Rule extraction predictive control development The goal of simplified rule extraction is to find the minimum number of inputs, thresholds, and parameters required to maintain most of the MPC energy savings and similar levels of comfort for the occupant. This approach proposes and develops a commercially practical implementation by removing the optimization calculation from building automation controllers where matrix operations and computational power are limited. Matrix multiplication and inversion cannot be executed in database programs of most BACnet building controllers without manual addition of code, rendering commercial usage of database matrix operations virtually non-existent. Decision trees were generated in this study using the MATLAB Classification Toolbox [47]. In this study, the prototype rule extraction control was developed based on the control decisions of the detailed MPC algorithm (i.e., the detailed algorithm was required to extract rules for this building). However, a long-term goal of future work is to generalize this approach by developing rules based on detailed MPC for several building archetypes, and utilize reinforcement learning to tune to individual buildings. Simulation studies already exist in the literature applying a similar approach to archetype buildings to extract rules [5,48]. The approach in this study is intended as a methodology to apply detailed MPC in a format that can easily interface with rule extraction for real BASs. Data collection for each season of detailed MPC for the 27 rooms resulted in over 40,000 total time series samples (roughly 1,500 samples of each data point per room) containing all the physical input and outputs of the BAS controllers and the intermediary parameters and predictions from the detailed MPC algorithm. All 27 rooms had the same primary façade and similar construction; thus, a single decision tree was proposed for room control. This had two primary benefits: the aggregate sample size was larger, and the implementation of a single set of extracted rules per façade (with similar space type and use) is significantly simpler to implement within a BACnet BAS controller via the GCL+ programming object than unique rule for each room. One important challenge introduced by aggregating the room data is the potential for overfitting to certain rooms that may be more prevalent in the training data set (particularly the rooms with higher window to wall ratios than the majority). To mitigate this, the samples were shuffled randomly, and classification tree learning was executed 1,000 times to identify the different rulesets that would be extracted by the random forests. For training and validation, the shuffled data was divided into two equal sets. The 1,000 iterations were considered an ensemble, where multiple data-driven models are used to reduce the variation of selected model parameters. Junctions in the decision trees where classifications were made (nodes) were also recorded. The classification error progression and node counts are plotted with respect to ensemble iteration in Fig. 7 (sorted by classification tree node count). Classification error had a stochastic element due to the random shuffling of samples. The rule extraction process resulted in 49 unique rule sets for the cooling season, and 28 unique rule sets for the heating season. Most of the additional unique rule sets for the cooling season occurred with larger classification trees. A compromise between accuracy and complexity was considered when selecting the best rule set for the rooms where a distinct \u201cjump\u201d in classification accuracy or the median (if no distinct \u201cjump\u201d is present) were selected from the ensemble. As a result, the 13 node trees were selected for both the cooling and heating seasons. The selected decision trees correspond with the median iteration for the cooling season and where there was a distinct jump in accuracy in the heating season when the ensemble increased from 11 to 13 nodes. The selected 13 node cooling and heating season decision trees are shown in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9 . Incorrect classification of cooling and heating season MPC control decisions occurred in 0.5-0.7% and 1.3-1.4% of the samples respectively for the selected rules. The resulting decision trees from the extracted rules relied on significantly less data than the detailed MPC algorithm. In the cooling season room IAT, IAT setpoint, occupancy prediction for 30 minutes in the future (MD2), and OAT prediction for 2 hours in the future (OAT4) are required. In the heating season room IAT, IAT setpoint, VAV heating power (VAV1), center of room ceiling illuminance (LUX1), and center of room ceiling illuminance prediction for 30 minutes in the future (LUX2) are required. This approach only requires four and five control inputs to emulate the MPC algorithm in the measure rooms in the cooling and heating seasons respectively. Of the previously mentioned inputs, predictions are only required for occupancy, outdoor air temperature, and illuminance. Outdoor air temperature predictions can be acquired from weather station applications, and occupancy schedule predictions can be made either with an embedded model or linking to enterprise level schedule data (and possibly access card logs). Illuminance prediction is the most difficult prediction to acquire in the proposed decision trees and required an individual linear fit for each room to convert from weather station solar radiation predictions. Other forms of modelling could be used to predict proxy solar gains in the rooms (e.g., moving average, autoregressive moving average), but room-level linear models were selected here to provide higher granularity and reduce algorithm complexity. The cooling season decision tree notably does not include any kind of solar proxy. This can be attributed to the measured rooms not receiving significant solar gains during most of the operating period due to their North-East orientation. Rooms with facades that receive more solar gains may include solar terms in the decision tree due to prevalence of radiative effects. Likewise, the heating season decision tree does not include occupancy or outdoor air temperature. These omissions are likely due to the relatively low occupancy ratio of the offices (most were occupied by professors with erratic schedules) and the relatively constant and low ambient air temperatures of the local climate in the daytime of the heating season (Ottawa, Canada). In both decision trees, the selected inputs and threshold were the result of the random forest machine learning algorithm and were representative of the transient characteristics of the MPC data [49]. Due to the nature of the inverse modelling approach applied to the rooms in the building studied, it is not possible to consider the generated decision trees as universal control algorithms. The presented decisions trees are a result of the methodology applied, and a proof of concept for utilizing classification trees for predictive control. The energy and comfort performance of the reactive control, MPC, and RE approaches for the measured rooms are compared in the following section. 2.5 Energy use analysis Energy use had to be quantified at the room level to determine if energy savings were achieved by MPC and RE control relative to the baseline reactive control. Data from the hydronic system and AHU sensors were used to estimate the room-level energy use. Steady-state heat transfer was assumed over each 5-minute interval. The literature asserts that this is a valid assumption for 15-minute (or smaller) intervals [50]. The energy use at each sample is calculated as the average over the sample interval as shown in Eq. (9), where E is the energy use at each time-step, Q is the average power at each time-step, and t is the index of the time-step. The heating power of the radiant heaters and reheat coils was estimated with Eq. (10), where Vh is the water flow rate, ρw is the density of water at 40°C, cpw is the specific heat of water at 40°C, T 1w is the supply water temperature, and T 2w is the return water temperature. Thermo-physical properties were acquired from Incropera et al. [51]. Heating and cooling energy supplied by the AHU was calculated using Eq. (11), where QSA is the supply air energy, Vr is the estimated room-level air flow rate, and VAHU is the AHUs air flow rate. (9) E ( t ) = Q ( t ) Δ t (10) Q h ( t ) = V h ( t ) ρ w c p w ( T 1 w ( t ) − T 2 w ( t ) ) (11) Q S A ( t ) = V r ( t ) V A H U ( t ) ( V h ( t ) ρ w c p w ( T 1 w ( t ) − T 2 w ( t ) ) ) 3 Results and Discussion This section demonstrates the value of the proposed rule extraction approach by quantifying the energy savings from testing the three different control algorithms over two floors of similar offices of an institutional building over the cooling and heating seasons. Results are presented in one-day periods for one room and are followed by aggregated results for all offices. Highlighted results include control mode operational comparisons, energy use comparisons, and clear statements of the limitation of the approach presented in this paper. 3.1 Control mode operational comparison The reactive control schedule-based IAT, IAT setpoint, VAV operation state (0/1 for OFF and ON), and heat supplied by the radiant heating panels (Q_Rad), VAV reheat coil (Q_RHC), and AHU coil (Q_AHU) are shown for both the cooling and heating seasons in Fig. 10 for a sample room over one day (room 3, from within a three-office zone with one exterior wall on the primary façade). The cooling and heating seasons will have different HVAC equipment requirements and loads due to ambient conditions (e.g., there is no radiant heater operation in the cooling season). Reactive control maintains VAV operation over the entire day with a relatively high minimum airflow rate (an average of 25 L/s for the single occupant offices) which can lead to over-ventilation, (i.e., when more fresh air is supplied to a room than is required by code or for the occupants), a common problem in modern buildings [52]. Reactive control HVAC operation in the cooling and heating seasons are clearly distinguished from one another by the 24-hour availability of the radiant heater. The IAT unoccupied setback is most apparent in Fig. 10 and Fig. 11 (reactive control and MPC cases). There is no programmed coordination between the VAV heating and radiant panel heating units, which can also lead to additional overshoot of the setpoint in the heating season. Additionally, the deviation between cooling and heating requirements of the individual rooms within the zone can lead to sub-optimal setpoint control for at least one room within the zone. The MPC algorithm presented in this study used machine learning (state-space models), input predictions (illuminance, occupancy, OAT, and HVAC cooling/heating), and modified zone control (code to override reactive control) to reduce energy use while maintaining similar or better occupant comfort compared to the reactive control algorithm as defined by setpoint deviation. Typical MPC operation for one room over a sample day in the cooling and heating season are shown for room 3 in Fig. 11, where the MPC bit and RE bit values are the 0 or 1 values (corresponding with overrides and normal reactive control respectively) from the MPC algorithm or RE decision trees. Zone-level VAV turndown in anticipation of setpoint overshoot can be seen in the MPC sample days. Setpoint overshoot is maintained to be similar or less than with the original reactive control algorithm, but the energy savings can be interpreted visually from the turndown of the VAV unit supply of AHU cooling or heating (and the turn down of the reheat coil and radiant heaters during the heating season). Further details of the setpoint deviations are discussed in the Energy use section and weekly average setpoint deviations are presented in Table 4 . One day of operation for room 3 of the simplified RE algorithm is shown in Fig. 12 for the cooling and heating season. The IAT is maintained closer to the setpoint when the RE algorithms is active, and this graphical observation is verified in Table 4. However, this also produces some cycling that occurs at a maximum frequency of every five minutes (the loop delay of the decisions trees within the BAS controller program). Setpoint deviation is smaller in the RE case largely due to the precise thresholds within the decision tree. Reactive control and MPC have some inherent deadbands due to PI (proportional integrating) loops and real-time optimization computational delays respectively. The period of MPC and RE overrides were compared to see how well the RE control emulated the MPC decisions in Fig. 13 and Fig. 14 . MPC and RE overrides do not have priority simultaneously (i.e., the MPC override does not work during RE scheduled weeks and vice versa). Consider the following two examples: 1) when an override is equal to one, the radiant heaters and VAV units are commanded to operate using unmodified reactive control, and 2) when an override is equal to zero, the system is overridden to the minimum operating level (e.g., 0% valve position for radiant heaters and unoccupied mode for VAV units). Zone-level overrides were compared to room-level overrides in Fig. 13 and Fig. 14 to illustrate the impact of modifications to zone control in testing weeks (where the average of room-level overrides in the zone had to be ≥ 0.5) on operation decisions. The unmodified zone-level reactive control used scaling and averaging of embedded room-level control loops to achieve a similar multi-room zone control effect in the absence of MPC or RE control. The scaling and averaging of room-level control loops in the reactive control algorithm yielded many heuristic (and often poorly tuned) parameters and rendered it relatively opaque. The RE overrides were retroactively calculated using the MPC algorithm input data and the selected decision trees for both seasons. If the RE and MPC overrides from the previously introduced algorithms both override for all operating time-steps (i.e., when the VAV unit was scheduled to be active) they will have a period of condition for MPC override = RE override of 100%. Consequently, the sum of the remaining possible conditions (MPC override > RE override and MPC override < RE override) and MPC override = RE override must be one, or 100%. The same logic can be applied between the MPC and RE overrides and the zone state to determine the influence of each room on the zone. Low period of equal conditions (MPC override = RE override, zone override = MPC override, and zone override = RE override) can indicate excessive energy use or poor setpoint control due to zoning. The zoning of the 27 rooms is shown in Fig. 15 . Some rooms will inherently dominate zone control due to aggressive setpoints (e.g., 24°C in one room vs. 20°C in the other rooms in the heating season) or unique thermal conditions (e.g., an extra external wall). This is a condition that occurred in the reactive control algorithm and the MPC and RE algorithms. Agreement can be seen between MPC and RE overrides in most cases, demonstrating the effectiveness of using one decision tree for all measured offices. The agreement between the two values could be attributed to either good model fit or relatively constant room cooling or heating requirements (i.e., the room almost always required heating or cooling). Room 20 had a low period of MPC overrides equaling RE overrides due missing data from a database malfunction. The MPC overrides were equal to the RE overrides for 77% and 86% of active VAV time-steps of the cooling and heating seasons respectively. Notable rooms that did not have much influence on zone-level overrides from room-level MPC and RE overrides in Fig. 13 are rooms 11, 15, and 16 in the cooling season and rooms 9, 19, and 21 in the heating season. They had significantly different setpoints than the other rooms in the zone (e.g., 23°C vs. 22°C and 21.5°C in one zone in the cooling season) and were often not able to simultaneously satisfy all spaces in the zone. The floor-level setpoint deviation is shown in Table 4 and is discussed further in the following section. The effect of room-level overrides on zone-level overrides was similar for both the MPC and RE algorithms. However, some rooms had significant increases or decreases. These differences are a result of the aggregation of room MPC control decisions to generate one decision tree for all of the rooms. The difference between the MPC and RE control overrides from the supervisory algorithm is another source of energy waste, but based on the energy use and setpoint deviation in Table 4 the inefficiency from using RE control is not large. 3.2 Energy use and indoor air temperature Energy use and IAT deviation from setpoint for the measured rooms was estimated at a weekly resolution and the floor-level to compare the effectiveness of the reactive control, MPC, and RE algorithms at saving energy and maintaining thermal comfort. Aggregate energy use was only presented here for the 25 offices to maintain consistent space types and was normalized by office for each floor to account for the different number of offices (12 on one floor, 13 on the other). Aggregate office-averaged cooling MPC and RE energy savings were 42% and 27%, respectively. MPC outperformed RE in the cooling season, but the sample size was only one week for each control mode due to the AHU level cooling coil flow meters not being programmed by the contractor until the third week of testing. RE outperformed MPC in the heating season, where MPC and RE achieved aggregated office averaged MPC and RE energy savings of 18% and 33% respectively. Heating energy use for week 9 was added to Table 4 for context but was not used in total algorithm energy savings because it had a higher OAT than the other weeks. The energy savings of the RE algorithm may have been higher than the MPC algorithm due to the significant setpoint deviation (and underheating) of the reactive control rooms in the first week of heating season testing. The reactive control rooms were not augmented by the test algorithm and operated as programmed by the control contractor during construction. Additionally, Floor A also had a higher setpoint deviation than the other test weeks in week 1, suggesting there was an issue with the hot water system at the building level that week. Floor B had higher setpoint deviations than Floor A throughout the heating season (particularly in the MPC weeks where the OAT and solar gains were lower), but this effect should be averaged out through the four weeks of alternating MPC and RE testing. In the cooling season the average setpoint deviations for all offices over the entire testing period for the reactive control, MPC, and RE algorithms were 0.5°C, 0.6°C, and 0.2°C respectively. In the heating season the average setpoint deviations for all offices over the entire testing period for the reactive control, MPC, and RE algorithms were -0.6°C, -0.6°C, and -0.2°C respectively. Negative setpoint deviations indicate the IAT is below the setpoint. The setpoint deviation of the MPC algorithm may have been higher than the reactive control in the cooling season due to ambient conditions. The 0.1°C difference is still within the sensor instrumentation error. Some rooms had worse setpoint control than others due to setpoint differences between the rooms within the zone. Zones with three or four offices exhibited more setpoint deviation during active schedule hours, but the zones with two offices on the North-East corner of the building (and higher glazing ratios) exhibited the largest setpoint deviations due to a demand mis-match (one office had two external walls and the other had one). Weekly average setpoint deviations are provided for each room and algorithm in Table 4. The heating season for Floor B generally also had higher setpoint deviation than the other offices (and even the same offices in the cooling season). In a single room test this would have been a significant issue, but because the test and control algorithms were each used to operate the floors for two weeks the bias from the setpoint deviation in Floor B was assumed to mostly cancel out. However, differences in ambient conditions for different weeks of testing could cause some imbalance in the setpoint and energy use bias. The similarity of ambient conditions during testing weeks is demonstrated in Fig. 16 , where the weekly average OAT, outdoor air relative humidity (OAH), and illuminance near the window (as a proxy for solar gains that enter the rooms) are plotted with office-normalized test and reactive energy use. 3.3 Limitations of study This study has many limitations based on the scope, available hardware, and available information. These limitations include the following: \u2022 The cost of electrical and thermal energy was assumed to be equal. Equations would need to be adjusted to reflect the difference in value of energy used if electrical and thermal energy are assumed to have different costs \u2022 The measured building had a high outdoor air ratio (0.9). This may have increased the total energy savings due to the relatively high heating and cooling demands, but the percent savings should still be representative of the effectiveness of the algorithm. \u2022 Other algorithms with different cost functions and R matrices could yield lower energy use or better occupant comfort. The MPC algorithm itself was not a target of optimization in this study. Several studies and tools exist that address this problem directly [8,53-57]. \u2022 A single decision tree for similar offices with the same façade boundary conditions was assumed to be adequate. Using one aggregated decision tree can result in sub-optimal control decisions for some rooms within the zone, but significantly simplifies the programming and troubleshooting effort. \u2022 Energy was only quantified for two weeks of the four-week cooling season MPC period due to missing data in the BAS. Ideally, energy used at the cooling coils of the AHUs would be quantified over the entire testing period. This limited testing period could reduce generalizability of the results when comparing the MPC and reactive control algorithms in the cooling season. \u2022 Ambient conditions varying between the testing of MPC and RE algorithms could bias the results of the in-situ testing. The average outdoor air temperatures for the test weeks are provided in Table 3 and Fig. 16, and remained relatively consistent. Effort was made in this study to mitigate the effect of ambient conditions on the test results by conducting testing as close to the middle of the heating and cooling seasons as possible. \u2022 Occupancy fraction differences between the floors during testing weeks can also have an impact on the energy use results. These occupancy fractions are provided in Table 3. The impact of occupants on energy use is somewhat mitigated by the high outdoor air ratio of this building but could have a greater impact on other buildings. \u2022 Floor-level energy use was normalized by office count (Floor A had 12 offices and Floor B had 13). \u2022 Differing occupancy between test and control group floors was assumed to average out over four weeks of switching algorithms. \u2022 Some sensors could have unverified instrumentation or precision errors. This was mitigated via spot checks to verify reasonable values were returned during dynamic building operation. \u2022 The selected decision trees developed here may not be applicable to other spaces. The process in this paper is presented in conjunction with the building specific results to facilitate the fitting of decision trees to other buildings. \u2022 RE control is impossible currently without detailed MPC (and likely networked control from a remote computer) to train the decision tree. \u2022 Due to the networked control from a remote computer, detailed MPC operation using linear time-invariant state-space models was limited in speed by the ability to read input, output, and variable data from the BAS controllers. The BAS controllers used in this study were new product and had better processor hardware to handle database queries than equipment installed in most existing buildings. Slower hardware could limit zone-level detailed MPC to updating at half-hour or hour intervals, limiting the ability to adjust to changing input conditions or prediction inaccuracy. \u2022 The energy savings of the predictive control algorithm in the form proposed in this study are limited by the underlying reactive control algorithm installed by the control contractor. High performance sequences of operation could improve the reactive control and augment the energy savings of MPC and RE control. 4 Conclusions This study described a process for generating simplified RE decision tree to perform control overrides and evaluated the energy use of both detailed MPC and the abstracted RE algorithm. It was found that aggregate office-averaged cooling MPC and RE energy savings were 42% and 27% respectively when compared to the reactive control over the four-week testing period. RE outperformed MPC in the heating season, where MPC and RE achieved aggregated office averaged MPC and RE energy savings of 18% and 33% respectively. The unexpected increase in energy savings of RE compared to MPC in the heating season could have been due to underheating of the reactive control offices in the early (MPC) test weeks. The difference between the indoor air temperature and the setpoint was lower in the reactive control rooms in the later (RE) weeks of the heating season, increasing the baseline energy use. In the cooling season the average setpoint deviations (averaged over the entire test period of four weeks) for all offices over the entire testing period for the reactive control, MPC, and RE algorithms were 0.5°C, 0.6°C, and 0.2°C respectively. In the heating season the average setpoint deviations for all offices over the entire testing period for the reactive control, MPC, and RE algorithms were -0.6°C, -0.6°C, and -0.2°C respectively. Overall, the MPC and RE algorithms both reduced energy use when compared to reactive control and did not have a negative impact on temperature setpoint control. Energy savings fluctuated weekly, and in some cases MPC saw more energy savings than RE (and vice versa). In this study MPC had a 1.5-hour control horizon, 15-minute calculation time for all 27 rooms, and required external calculations to actuate a BACnet BAS. Meanwhile, RE control had a five-minute control horizon, parallel room-level calculation time of less than one second and could directly actuate within the BACnet BAS. Due to the simplicity, tangibility, and comparable energy savings of the RE algorithm compare to the MPC algorithm, it is suggested that RE approaches be evaluated in-situ in future work. This approach relies heavily on inverse modelling, and the repeatability and reliability will likely improve with a larger sample size. Future work should focus on the following topics to improve standardization of predictive control and the usability of the presented RE methodology: \u2022 ASHRAE Guideline 13 and Guideline 36 should be used for the baseline reactive control [39,58]. The measured building in this study did not adhere to these new guidelines, thus the baseline control is not necessarily standard due to the lack of a standard. Prior to the release of Guideline 36 in 2018, there was no consistently defined baseline control sequence for VAV systems, and sequences could vary significantly for every building. \u2022 Control scenarios should be expanded through simulation to develop base rules for different climates, building types, and MPC cost functions. Usage of the Open Building Control project from Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory could automatically generate the GCL+ code for archetypal decision trees [53]. \u2022 Once archetypal decision trees are developed, reinforcement learning should be tested to tune the threshold of the base models. To date, reinforcement learning has been evaluated in the literature for use with occupant-based control [59-61]. The same adaptive tuning principles could be applied to decision trees. \u2022 In the absence of RE decision trees for direct control, this approach could be applied to pare down the input requirements of existing MPC algorithms. Many inputs and parameters are not useful to the detailed algorithm and reducing the data acquisition and training effort could also improve the proliferation of detailed algorithms as well.

        "dc:description": "Model-based predictive control (MPC) has been promoted as a software-based energy saving approach for buildings since the 2000s. However, there has not been significant industry adoption of MPC using current approaches. This paper proposes and tests an approach to MPC using rule extraction (RE) that can be easily implemented in building controllers to override sub-optimal control. The resulting decision trees could be implemented by building control programmers to save energy when ambient conditions are predicted to satisfy the thermal requirements of the spaces. A detailed MPC algorithm using inverse models was implemented in 27 rooms of an institutional building to provide data for a classification learning approach. Cooling and heating season decision trees were generated based on the inputs and outputs of the detailed MPC algorithm. An ensemble and sample randomization were used to generalize the trees across rooms and prevent overfitting to individual rooms. Cooling season MPC and RE energy savings were 42% and 27% respectively and heating season MPC and RE energy savings were 18% and 33% respectively. Both algorithms also reduced the difference between the temperature setpoint and measured indoor air temperature compared to the reactive controls.",
