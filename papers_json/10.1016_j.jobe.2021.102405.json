This paper presents a comprehensive educational model considering share resources among several departments bounded to educational limitations for optimizing energy consumption. The thermal model calculates the load based on the ambient temperature to minimize the user's knowledge of the building's thermal model. It determines the percentage reduction of the building's heating load in case of a change in room temperature, a term's start date, and sharing classes compared to standard curricula. It employs linear Boolean optimization. Class planning is carried out concerning minimizing energy use, students' preferences, charts, educational constraints, professors' schedules, classes' numbers, and shared resources. Optimal timetabling influences on the heating load for Shiraz University's second engineering building complex are analyzed, used by Mechanical Engineering, Computer Engineering departments, and Auditorium. The effects of three scenarios and two situations on energy consumption are quantified. The results indicate the best curriculum is not affected by the scenarios. A two-week early beginning and a temperature of 23C of classes reduce energy consumption by over 50%. In deploying the optimal timetabling, the potential of diminishing the heating energy consumption is about 12% compared with conventional timetabling. Sharing resources do not always lead to a decrease in energy use, but this activity can slide it by 2.5%. These results are aligned with commercial software's outcomes. To tackle the obstacle of the computational load, reducing a matrix's dimensions is implemented. It cuts down the number of decision variables, unequal and equal constraints from 90.8%, 99.97%, and 57.81%, respectively.

The atmosphere's greenhouse gas concentrations will not decrease unless fossil fuel consumption dwindles [1]. With energy consumption as a significant factor in countries' development, energy use is soaring throughout all continents and pushing the economy's carriage further. In the light of extensive data analyses and predictive studies, it is now no mystery that not only doesn't the fashion in energy consumption decrease, but also it will keep on an increasing trend (International Energy Agency (IEA), [2\u20134]. To cope with this surging demand and keep the supply capacities in balance, most energy-intensive sectors should be detected. As the most energy devouring sector, the building is responsible for almost 40% of final energy use [5]. Educational facilities, such as university and school buildings, are associated with roughly 12% of the commercial sector's energy demand [6\u20138]. Ascribed to the limited responsibilities of the educational buildings' occupants, they are substantially marginalized in terms of energy consumption reduction and saving measures [9]. Energy-saving measures in this type of buildings could be broken down into two approaches; operational and technical improvements [10,11]. The first one deals with operational aspects of a building like ameliorated HVAC control schemes or modifying occupants\u2019 behavior, such as their presence schedule [12\u201315]. The second method is entwined in technical features, such as replacing energy-consuming air conditioning systems with more efficient surrogates. In the jargon of energy saving in buildings, the first approach mostly opts over the second because it is cheaper and more pragmatic to implement in real life [16]. One of the most practical methods to reform energy use in educational buildings is to optimize their presence schedule, which directly corresponds to an energy-friendly timetable in the context of academic buildings. Timetabling is to optimally allocate available resources, like time and space, from an energy setting point of view [17]. Timetabling of an educational building poses a certain number of courses to a certain number of time slots and classrooms [18,19]. One of the most challenging issues regarding timetabling is the NP-hard nature of the problem, causing the solution time to increase exponentially proportionate to the size of the constraints [20]. There are numerous studies that have addressed the complication of timetabling in an academic environment. Still, a few of them investigated the perplexing issue from energy efficiency perspective and shared resource allocation simultaneously. Despite the various extensive literature about timetabling, this study review those enhanced ones which considered energy-saving measures. Lindahl et al. [21] presented a metaheuristic method that would guide the MIP-solver to find the right feasible solutions more rapidly for the first time. The proposed technique made amends to the performance of the mixed-integer programming solvers in a pragmatic setting. The suggested metaheuristic in cases that the MIP is utilized to search for a part of the solution space in each iteration acted as a large neighborhood explorer. Their method availed of making smaller problems for the solver than the large one by fixing several variables given the problem-specific knowledge, which improved the solution iteratively. Taking advantage of such faculties, their proposed method could work well on large-scale problems promptly. In another study, Lindahl et al. [22] formulated three bi-objective mixed-integer models to formulate curriculum-based course timetabling and Second International Timetabling Competition (ITC 2007) dataset. The three incorporated objectives they considered were available rooms, teaching time slots, and quality. They devised an algorithm based on the ϵ-constraint method. The proposed algorithm could be deployed to assess the impression of various available resources on the timetabling problem. They also investigated how those three objectives affected each other. Lindahl et al. [23] studied the disruptions exerted on the timetabling problem in a dynamic environment and the methods to develop a new timetable resembling the old one, which has the least possible impact on the occupants. They defined this issue as a perturbation problem in which the objective was to find a solution with only a slight alternation. A drawback of this scheme was a low-quality timetable with adverse features that could affect the occupants' convenience. The method made the timetable to be easy to implement. The suggested plan was formulated as a bi-objective model solving through mixed-integer programming. They considered different disruptions and introduced multiple solutions. Finally, the user could choose among the solutions by plainly having a trade-off between the number of perturbations and the timetable's quality. Song et al. [24] presented a course timetable algorithm that could account for energy-saving measures. This study's methodology practically showed a promising saving potential of 4% in university buildings solely by implementing an optimized timetable. They further illustrated by avowing hard constraints in the timetabling problem that higher energy saving may also be achieved. Although the outcomes were quite considerable in energy saving, the method was mainly concerned with the spatial allocation of courses, and the time of holding them was not examined. Kim et al. [25] carried out a study in which the occupants' optimal behavior was addressed to gain energy saving while maintaining indoor thermal comfort in educational buildings. The proposed method was based on energy simulation and optimization tools. The only gap is that the methodology only refined the occupant's behavior and did not provide an energy-efficient timetable. Jafarinejad et al. [9] brought a bi-level energy-efficient timetable optimization strategy and then assessed its upshots on a university building model predictive controller. Their timetable optimization scheme first provided an optimal occupancy presence profile in the real number domain in the first level. Afterward, in the second level, it assigned all the available courses to the early levels occupancy profile with least possible divergence while adhering to a set of soft and hard constraints. The proposed timetable was able to reduce the educational building energy consumption by 1.3%, and after implementing it in a model predictive controller, the energy saving potential increased from 11.65% to 19%. Some of the reviewed studies addressed the course timetable in an energy-efficient manner, which were not in-depth. To conduct a thorough timetabling, a precise model should be incorporated into the methodology. A question, however, outstands here is how detailed the model should be. The previous research studies' deployment models were mostly nonlinear and complex, resulting in unnecessary computational load. Hence, a trade-off may seem crucial between the model accuracy and its implicated computational time intensity. Also, another issue that needs to be tackled in universities is the shared classrooms between different departments. This problem is likely to inflict challenging constraints on an already complex optimization problem. One such condition is to offer the same courses instructed by various professors in the same time slots for the student to choose their course based on the professor's merit and not on the grounds of schedule preference. The other exacting and challenging constraint is to take co-requisite/prerequisite courses into account while solving the timetable problem. Although there is a wide range of strategies accessible to reduce energy consumption in buildings, which could be implemented at universities, a few research in terms of timetabling in this matter has been carried out. This scarcity stems from the wrong perception of class planning's simplicity and the absence of investigations about the relationship between timetabling and energy consumption. It is worth mentioning that holding class when the difference between outside and inside temperature is low leads to minimized heating or cooling energy consumption. The circumstances bringing the excessive heating or cooling load are curricula limitations such as pre-requirements or class timing. Frequently, each department has its classes, which could be shared with others to alleviate initial and operating costs, despite the complication of managing the shared resources. Past studies' proposed structures could not practically attract departments to use the strategies for planning their curricula because of using specific building models of their own case studies, not considering other departments' resources, and some limitations on curricula. In this paper, a simplified model prioritizes various educational time slots, easy to implement in all departments. Although it could affect energy reduction precision, it still is the best option from the energy perspective. The other noticeable point of this study is diminishing the computational load. The method for doing it causes the dimensions of the technical coefficients\u2019 matrix to decrease considerably, making it feasible for ordinary computers to carry out the calculations. This study's main intention is to establish a model that considers standard curricula limitations and gives an exceptional opportunity for shared classes for more efficient planning. In this situation, every department has its proportion of classes at every hour of a day, introducing a possibility of sharing resources. The empty classes represent the curricula restrictions. The other goal of this model is to determine the exchange of resources between departments. The model can analyze the influence of set temperature on energy consumption, the number of classes, and the starting date of a semester. 2 Modeling The proposed model applies to plan the timetable of shared classes at a university campus. This planning is performed because both energy consumption is minimized and restrictions on educational facilities are fulfilled, dealing with different departments\u2019 relationships. Another merit is that it can obtain the best possible point of the planning operation and prioritize other topics from the energy consumption aspect. Furthermore, it calculates the effects of variations on the starting date of a semester, class timing, and class temperature. Challenges and limitations of the timetabling for a university are as follows: First constraint: meeting and activity times that professors have to participate. Since faculty members should engage in the university's weekly meetings and their educational and social activities, holding classes at every time slot is impossible. Second constraint: similar courses holding at the same time. It is observed in the School of mechanical engineering, Shiraz university, that if two or more professors run a course and it is held at the same time slot, the educational quality is increased. This growth happens because the students prefer to select the best teachers, not the best time. Third constraint: opportunity of taking a course. Organizing courses are regularly based on the standard chart of each department. Therefore, preventing the lack of courses for students who do not consult with the chart should be one of the model's constraints. Fourth constraint: not running two separate courses in a class. It is impossible to organize two courses in a class. Fifth constraint: considering not to present two classes for a professor at the same period. A professor cannot participate in two different classes in the same time slot. A department has a limited number of accessible classes, which could not be exceeded. Those mentioned restrictions of shared classes culminate in the fact that this system's optimum operation is not practical unless departments cooperate on this matter. This model calculates the cost coefficients for each class. In the next section, which is the first mathematical programming, the schedule of classes is determined. Repetition of the developed circle is necessary to get prioritizes right. The second mathematical programming introduces timetabling of classes copping with departments\u2019 relations. 2.1 First section: demand model Timetabling requires that the heating/cooling load should be calculated. Using complex models for carrying out this task is not practical because of the three blow reasons. 1. Planning classes for each semester has some uncertainties, such as the number of students, occupants' unpredictable behavior, temperature, and radiant intensity 2. This type of planning is complicated and time-consuming owing to the curricula constraints. 3. These models' main goal is not to investigate the heating/cooling demand but to arrange the classes' schedule. The desired model, therefore, not only should have an insignificant computational load but also does not need detailed input information. Such models are [26,27], PRISM, and Analyze GRAphique Mensuelle des consommations (ANAGRAM) [28]. Among them, ANAGRAM is selected because it needs fewer data and has a lower computational load. Even though complex models usually demand more input data, meaning added uncertainties, they do not increase precision. It means that considering more phenomena could increase accuracy in the first step. However, some events are presumed stochastic, which usual mathematical functions can not describe. This happens because their nature is not fully recognized, resulting in some inaccuracies. Alburg [29] and Hay et al. [30] about the electric arc furnace are the two examples. The ANAGRAM model is classified as reverse modeling methods. This model considers the heating energy consumption of a building regarding the weather condition. Simplicity and not requiring the building's data are this model's main merits [28]. But it can not quantify occupancy and thermal mass effects on energy use and divide different sections' energy consumption [31,32]. The ANAGRAM assumes a linear function between heating and ambient temperature if the outside temperature is lower than inside in cold seasons. Otherwise, the heating energy would be zero. Requirements for utilizing this model are justifiable with the case study since it is not practical to store energy in the building. Students use the outside space between classes, and doors and windows are mostly open in this period. In this section, the energy cost coefficient and supplying heating/cooling demand of classes for time slots are assessed. ANAGRAM is mostly utilized for analyzing monthly heating load [28]. Its assumptions are executed in this study for hourly demand. The presumptions of this calculation are as follows: 1. The load is dependent on a linear function of the temperature difference and the optimal point. To obtain maximum accuracy, the lesser time difference between those two variables has to be applied. This period, thus, is assumed to be half an hour. 2. The possibility of using cooling equipment in warm seasons or vice versa is not credible. Subsequently, if ambient temperature in heating seasons (cooling seasons) increases (lowers) over the comfort temperature, the energy is not consumed to adjust the indoor temperature. 3. The rate of energy consumption is a linear function of the heating/cooling load. The class position and number of students, impacting loads, are not involved in the heating/cooling demand calculations. 4. All the classes are well-equipped and have sufficient access for disabled people. 5. Regarding the complicated estimation of temperature at a specific hour and the underlying aim of dipping computational calculations, the cost of energy for holding a class at a particular hour is speculated to be distinct from the specific day. 6. Each course contains two-time slots on alternate days, and the same ones with different professors are run in the same hour. 7. These time slots of every single class are persistent on the educational days. The first to third assumptions are from the ANAGRAM model [28,31,32]. The fourth to seventh ones are about the classes' building and the departments' curricula. There is no obligation to apply these assumptions to the building. In Shiraz University, it is common to hold courses on two sets of days, which are Saturday-Monday and Sunday-Tuesday. Dimensions, equipment, and accessibility of the building's rooms are equal, leading to no priority for choosing classes over the others. The assumptions 4 to 7 influence the 3 and 5 equations of the developed optimization model, and the 1 to 3 ones affect the model's selection for estimating the heating/cooling load. The heating/cooling load relies on materials, plan, location, geography, usage, equipment, people, and other building factors. In the case study, the limited number of elective courses and holding the same courses on equal time slots, which change the time of classes, can not affect the number of participants. The classes are frequently run in the daytime, and electrical apparatuses, such as laptops, are not regular. The heating/cooling load, hence, heavily depends on the time slot in which the course is held. In fact, the proposed model quantifies the percentage of the load reduction for buildings compatible with the assumptions. But it is imaginable that many facilities do not support these assumptions. Although the energy reduction rate could not be that reliable in these circumstances, the suggested strategies of managing curricula are the best options to slash the load. Based on the assumptions, the energy cost's coefficient of running a course at a specific time is calculated as Equation (1). Assumptions 6 and 7 establish the number of the vector's elements are equal to different time slots of courses (K). The first half of it is similar to the second one; assumption 5 delineates it. Equation (2) shows the calculated cost is divided by infinity norm or maximum norm. (1) C i − j = ∑ D a y = S t e n ( ∑ K = 1 n ( C T − T ِ D a y ∗ j − i n ∗ 24 + i + j − i n ∗ K ) H e a v i s i d e ( C T − T ِ D a y ∗ j − i n ∗ 24 + i + j − i n ∗ K ) ) (2) C \u203e = C C ∞ Where, in Equation (1), C i-j is the energy cost of cooling/heating services for holding a class in the period between i and j, T t is the ambient temperature in t, CT is the comfort temperature, n is the number of temperatures measured during i to j, and, finally, st and en are the first and last day of a semester, respectively. If the average temperature of each half-hour is available and the duration of classes is 90-min, n will be 3. In Equation (2), C is a coefficient vector of the energy cost of providing cooling/heating load for running a course related to each professor on time slots. The classes are on Saturdays-Mondays or Sundays-Tuesdays at a similar time. The coefficient is a function of the time slots, independent of the days. Owing to these two last factors, the number of elements is even, and the first half of the vector is equivalent to the intervals of those two sets of days. \u2016 C \u2016 ∞ is infinity norm and C \u203e is the normalized vector of energy cost. The number of vector elements represents the number of time slots in which the class is taken part. In the case study, the vector length is 14. The cost coefficient of optimization for each department (d), which is a vector, is formed from the repetition of C \u203e , I d ∗ J d counts. 2.2 Second section: first mathematical programming The first step for evaluating the best timetabling's effects on energy consumption is to consider departments without ties between each other. This strategy can be applied since the resources of all departments are separated. The optimization problem is defined in the way to be binary integer linear programming. Decision variables ( x i d j d k d ) specify not-holding (value of zero) or holding (value of one) of a course ( i d ) by a professor ( j d ) at an exact time (k) and department (d). The number of decision variables of each department is calculated by multiplying the number of department's professors (I d ) the number of courses (J d ) with the number of intervals in a week (K). The arrangement of classes relies on energy cost minimization for a year. This energy cost depends only on an hour of a class. Equation (3) reveals the proposed optimization problem. (3) M i n Z d = ∑ k ∑ j d ∑ i d C \u203e k x i d j d k d Const1_1 S t . x i d j d λ d = 0 ∀ λ ∈ λ , λ ⊆ K Const1_2 x i d j d \u2032 k \u2032 d = 0 ∀ j d \u2032 ∈ j d \u2032 , j d \u2032 ⊆ J d ∀ k \u2032 ∈ k \u2032 , k \u2032 ⊆ K Const2 x α j d k d = x α j d \u2032 k d ∀ j d & j d \u2032 ∈ J d ∀ α ∈ I d ∀ k ∈ K Const3 x i d j d k d + x i d \u2032 j d \u2032 k d ≤ τ j j \u2032 τ ∈ { 1 , 2 } ∀ i d & i d \u2032 ∈ I d ∀ j d & j d \u2032 ∈ J d Const4 ∑ i d = 1 I d ∑ j d = 1 J d x i d j d k d ≤ N k d ∀ k ∈ K Const5 ∑ j d = 1 J d x i d j d k d ≤ 1 ∀ k ∈ K ∀ i d ∈ I d Lower and upper bands x i d j d k d : B o o l e a n The first part of the first set of constraints, Equation (3), implies the impossibility of holding classes at a particular time because of several factors, such as meetings, breaks, or low efficiency of the department's course. λ is a subset of the conventional intervals. The second part of this set marks time restrictions on the availability of professors. The second set of constraints is responsible for the notion of running a matching course in the same time slot. The third one guarantees the planning of classes in which every student can enroll in their required course, complying with the standard chart. Needless to say that this planning must consider another situation which is not possible for every pupil to stick to the chart; hence, courses have to be available for them. If two courses, for example, j and j \u2019 , are happening simultaneously, τ is 2. This measure means that students cannot take part in both of the courses; maybe one of them is a prerequisite of the other. Otherwise, τ will be 1, demonstrating they can participate in both. It is lucid that a class is assigned just to a course at the exact time slot. The fourth set of constraints carries out this task. N k d shows the number of classes assigned to a department (d) in a time slot (k). Lastly, the fifth one introduces the fact that a professor cannot hold two courses simultaneously. Equation (5) establishes the standard formation of the optimization relating to the sequence of decision variables. In Equation (5), x ( n ) is corresponding to x i d j d k d and n can be found by equation (4). (4) n = { ( j d − 1 ) ∗ ( K ∗ I d ) + ( i − 1 ) ∗ ( K ) + k d = 1 ( ∑ d \u2032 = 1 d − 1 ( J d \u2032 ∗ K ∗ I d \u2032 ) ) + ( ∑ d \u2032 = 1 d − 1 ( K ∗ I d \u2032 ) ) + ( j − 1 ) ∗ ( K ∗ I d ) + ( i − 1 ) ∗ ( K ) + k d > 1 There is a prospect that those limitations would lead to not existing any search space. Therefore, in these circumstances, the cost of holding a class is considered to be infinite. 2.3 Third section: second mathematical programing Timetabling of all departments, which contemplates relationships between them, is revised by a binary integer linear programming. This consideration's logic is that exchanging classes between departments is not meant to raise energy costs than the previous phase. Equation (3) is for a department. Accordingly, Equation (3) can be modified to Equation (5) for all departments with shared classes. (5) M i n Z = [ C \u203e 1 ⋯ C \u203e D ] [ X 1 ⋮ X D ] [ A 1 O ⋯ 0 0 A 2 ⋯ 0 ⋮ ⋮ 0 0 ⋯ A D ] [ X 1 X 2 ⋮ X D ] ≤ [ b 1 b 2 ⋮ b D ] [ A e q 1 O ⋯ 0 0 A e q 2 ⋯ 0 ⋮ ⋮ 0 0 ⋯ A e q D ] [ X 1 X 2 ⋮ X D ] = [ b e q 1 b e q 2 ⋮ b e q D ] [ C \u203e 1 O ⋯ 0 0 C \u203e 2 ⋯ 0 ⋮ ⋮ 0 0 ⋯ C \u203e D ] [ X 1 X 2 ⋮ X D ] ≤ [ Z 1 o p t Z 2 o p t ⋮ Z D o p t ] In Equation (5), the subscript shows the department, X d is the decision variables' vector of classes\u2019 professors, C \u203e d is the energy service cost coefficient of holding a course, A d is technical coefficients of unequal constraints, b d is resources of unequal constraints, A e q d is technical coefficients of equal constraints, b e q d is resources of equal constraints and Z d o p t is the energy service cost of the department (d) without shared classes. There are several methods to solve the presented optimization model, such as the branch and bound, cutting plane, genetic algorithm, and several others. Intlinprog function has been chosen for this study. 2.4 Approaches to reduce calculations One of the challenging issues of timetabling for academic purposes is the dimension of unequal and equal matrixes. The low ratio between the average number of courses a professor presents and the total number of courses of a department causes a significant portion of decision variables to be zero. As a result, the proposed approach to diminish the calculation load is to eliminate these decision variables with a given value. This elimination, which is related to not-presented courses of a professor, does not affect optimal timetabling due to their zero value on any particular hour and day. The ratio between courses of professors and total courses is negligible. For example, in Mechanical Engineering, Computer Engineering departments, and Auditorium of Shiraz University, this ratio is 0.047, 0.051, and 0.059, respectively. This indicates that because there are not many courses held by a professor, substantial decision variables are zero. Being zero means there is no course of a professor on a specific time slot. Due to this reasoning, the idea is implemented, and those zero decision variables are excluded from the optimization. The challenging issue is to lessen the problem and return it to primary conditions for reporting the results. 3 Results The developed model of this study is implemented in classes of Shiraz University's second engineering building complex. This complex is devoted just to hold specialized courses in Mechanical Engineering, Computer Engineering and general ones of other departments, called Auditorium. University's regulations suggest that all courses should be held on different days but at the exact time slots. To show that there are always not exchange between departments, two situations are defined. The first does not affect the timetabling based on modeling and the second, containing sharing classes, causes cost reduction for all departments. Since there can be a marked difference between the general optimal solution and subsequent ones in Integer Boolean programming, the amount of energy variation due to the next choices is assessed. Suggestion and priority demonstrate the position of solutions in programming. Table 1 shows the overall information of professors, courses, and classes dedicated to each department. Detailed information is provided in the research data. The number of course groups is more than courses because there can be several ones of them, run by different professors. In this section, optimal timetabling of the 2019 fall semester is calculated, and it adheres to the existing conditions of that moment. The effect of the classes\u2019 adjusted temperature, the date of the beginning of the term, and eliminating the current restrictions on classes are investigated in two situations in this study. In the first one, allocating classes is planned, that the exchange of the resources is not an option, and this exchange leads to a reduction in energy consumption in the second one. It is concluded that a change in the adjusted temperature and an early start of the academic term do not affect the curricula, shown in Fig. 1 . The figure shows the coefficients of the normalized cost for holding classes in different scenarios in each time slot. The priority of taking courses is determined on this figure, and it is equal in all scenarios based on the decreasing energy cost. These coefficients point out that reducing the adjusted temperature and the early beginning of the semester can diminish energy consumption in the building's heating sector. A more than two-week early start is not suggested since the cooling load should be satisfied. Because of the assumption of weekdays not having any influence on the cooling or heating energy cost in a specific period, the model can have multiple optimal answers. In every scenario, the total number of assigned classes to departments in the same time slot on either Saturdays-Mondays or Sundays-Tuesdays is equal. Fig. 2 presents this total number for four priorities for the first situation's minimum energy cost. For the mechanical engineering department, two curricula with an equal cost in the heating sector are projected. As shown by Fig. 3 , these two plans are for the optimal solution in the first and the second situation of allocating classes for the first to fourth priorities. Two curricula are validated for two defined situations since, in both ones, the number of the classes assigned to the School of Mechanical Engineering is equal. Figs. 4 and 5 show the effect of exchanging classes and choosing the first to fourth priorities on energy consumption, respectively. These two figures demonstrate that the prospect of exchanging classes between departments always does not reduce energy use. In Fig. 5, the reason behind why there are variations in the effect of the exchange on heating energy consumption is the way the model performs. Based on Equation (5), curricula planning relies on each department's aggregate energy costs and decreasing the heating energy cost. Since this research's presented problem has multiple optimal solutions, it may give different answers and energy consumptions of departments. However, the total number of classes allocated to departments in the two sets of weekdays will remain constant. This total number is specified in Table 2 . 3.1 Eliminating the restriction on classes If the limits on classes are removed, 22 courses will be run in the Auditorium between 14\u201315:30 owing to this department's no limitation on professors and curricula. The Computer Engineering department has restraints on professors who cannot teach a course simultaneously, and as a result, 35 and 8 classes are held in 14\u201315:30 and 10:30\u201312 periods, correspondingly. The curricula restriction is why there is no course in the second priority (12:30\u201314:00). The more limitations of the Mechanical Engineering department create three courses in the second priority (12:30\u201314), 30 ones in the third (10:30\u201312:00), 13 ones in the fourth (16:00\u201317:30), and five ones in the fifth (9:00\u201310:30). No course in the School of Mechanical Engineering is held in the first priority (14:00\u201315:30) period because it is reserved for the meetings. Still, the maximum of three classes in the second priority is considered in this scenario. 3.2 Influence of each scenario on energy consumption The conventional methods for reducing energy consumption are decreasing class temperature in heating seasons, early commencement of the term in heating seasons, rising the number of classes, and rational energy utilization. Fig. 6 sets out the influence of the first two strategies on the energy demand for every department's best scenario. As shown in Fig. 6, a two-week early start of the term is one of the most effective ways to alleviate high energy consumption. The temperature in the no limitation on the classes scenario is adjusted to 23 °C. This temperature and the early start of the term decrease energy use. This reduction is dependent on the curricula and the number of courses. While this scenario is the third one in the Auditorium, where there are the least courses and restrictions, it is the fourth one in the Computer Engineering department. The effects of optimum planning on energy consumption will be assessed. Fig. 7 illustrates that a higher percentage of energy reduction is rooted in either a decrease in classes\u2019 temperature or the early beginning. TRNSYS was used to validate the model's results for the case study. The heating load in standard and optimal curricula of room temperature 23 °C scenario was analyzed for several situations. These situations were the open and close portion and time of windows, the number of students, Hysteresis temperature control, and changing Saturday-Monday and Sunday-Tuesday sets. These factors can affect calculating the load by around 0.03 to 1.5%. The load reduction in optimal curricula than standard one would vary between five to 20%. If the rate of variations is considered as the case study, the model's accuracy is ±3%. This paper continues the former study, which was the optimal curricula's influence on the Department of Energy Engineering, Sharif University of Technology [9]. At first, the building's model was simulated on commercial software. It was then revealed that its results were considerably different from an online monitoring system installed at the moment. Irregular behavior of students about opening and closing the windows caused this divergence. These three scenarios bring out strategies to diminish energy consumption by how the curriculum is organized. They are as follow: 1. A change in temperature and the start date of the academic term cannot affect the curricula. 2. The early beginning of the fall semester has the most prominent influence on cutting down energy consumption in the heating sector among all defined scenarios. Consisting of a two-week early commencement and a temperature of 23 °C, this activity can reduce energy consumption even more than 50% compared with the conventional start and 26 °C. 3. At the conventional beginning of the fall semester, using the optimal timetabling will slash the heating energy consumption in classes by around 12%. 4. Shared recourses diminish this type of energy consumption, 2.5%, in comparison to no shared ones. 5. The greater number of available classes leads to energy consumption reduction due to running these classes at hours with the lowest energy costs. However, in reality, it is not possible because of the following reasons: a) No time interference among required courses of the standard chart: courses should be organized that all students, even those who do not take them based on the chart, can enroll in them. b) Curricula constraints: for example, if two or more professors hold a specific course, their time slot has to be the same. c) Not holding courses at particular hours: this limitation exists since there are some meetings and other responsibilities that individuals should attend and fulfill. 6. While shared resources sometimes cannot slide energy consumption, it is projected that this exercise in the case study will result in a 2.5% reduction. 7. This research's two problems, which are timetabling of classes with and without shared resources, usually have multiple optimal answers. In the shared situation, these solutions can have different effects on the departments' energy consumption decrease, but each department's total consumption will be equal. Moreover, tactics that significantly dropped computational burden culminate in fewer elements' of A (lower and upper bounds are not involved in) and A eq , from 13,392,260*33,516 (about 52.25 GB) and 3759*33,516 (approximately 15.02 MB) to 35,945*3094 (13.26 MB) and 1586*3094 (0.585 MB). This phenomenon stems from the limited ratio of a professor's courses to total courses. Overal, Not requiring extensive data and special knowledge to analyze the heating/cooling load, as well as the following features, lead to the proposed framework for diminishing the academic buildings\u2019 energy use. 1. Considering a wide range of educational constraints, like holding similar courses on equal time slots or prerequisites 2. Proper planning of the courses with the possibility of those students pick them either based on the standard chart or not 3. The limitation of professors' presence 4. The number of classes 5. Curricula of shared resources among departments 6. Prospect of sharing classes among departments 7. Very low computational load 4 Conclusion This study presents a novel model to reduce academic buildings' heating/cooling load through curricula planning. It not only considers educational limitations and facilities but also can observe sharing resources, which boosts beneficiaries' utility. This optimization model's challenging point for reaching the best planning is the sheer problem's computational load. It comes from academic restrictions, exclusive buildings' thermal model, and the technique of defining the relationship between departments. To tackle this issue, decision variables with known values are eliminated from the optimization. A thermal model dependent on the ambient temperature is used to calculate all buildings' load. Hence, ordinary users, who do not have apecial knowledge of this type of modeling, can operate it. Sharing classes happens when this action's expenses do not exceed compared to no sharing situation. This model was used to organize three departments' schedules, namely Mechanical Engineering, Computer Engineering, and Auditorium. These three departments run their classes in Shiraz University's second engineering building complex. This study demonstrates that changing the classes' temperature and starting a semester do not affect the optimal curricula. Among scenarios, the maximum influence on energy consumption reduction comes from the early start of the fall semester. Suppose the term starts two-week earlier and the temperature is 23oC. In that case, the heating energy use will decline even to more than half compared to the conventional start of the fall semester and indoor temperature 26 oC. Comparing the current condition with optimal one, the potential for reducing energy is 11%, 15%, and nine percent for Mechanical Engineering, Computer Engineering departments, and Auditorium, respectively. The overall potential is around 12%. These results are aligned with commercial software's outcomes. Sharing resources does not always have the anticipated outcomes, and the strategies of allocating classes will cause multiple optimal answers. In these circumstances, the optimal solutions may have various values for departments. The total heating energy consumption of them, on the other hand, will remain the same. The most noticeable obstacle of arranging classes using mathematical programming is its computational loads. The suggested method for dealing with this challenge considerably decreases the number of decision variables, the required space, matrix size for unequal and equal constraints by approximately 33,516, 13,392,260, 3759 to 3094, 35,945, and 1586, respectively. These alterations mean a reduction of around 90.8%, 99.97%, and 96.11% in each one, separately. The unequal constraints are without upper and lower bounds.

        "dc:description": "This paper presents a comprehensive educational model considering share resources among several departments bounded to educational limitations for optimizing energy consumption. The thermal model calculates the load based on the ambient temperature to minimize the user's knowledge of the building's thermal model. It determines the percentage reduction of the building's heating load in case of a change in room temperature, a term's start date, and sharing classes compared to standard curricula. It employs linear Boolean optimization. Class planning is carried out concerning minimizing energy use, students' preferences, charts, educational constraints, professors' schedules, classes' numbers, and shared resources. Optimal timetabling influences on the heating load for Shiraz University's second engineering building complex are analyzed, used by Mechanical Engineering, Computer Engineering departments, and Auditorium. The effects of three scenarios and two situations on energy consumption are quantified. The results indicate the best curriculum is not affected by the scenarios. A two-week early beginning and a temperature of 23C of classes reduce energy consumption by over 50%. In deploying the optimal timetabling, the potential of diminishing the heating energy consumption is about 12% compared with conventional timetabling. Sharing resources do not always lead to a decrease in energy use, but this activity can slide it by 2.5%. These results are aligned with commercial software's outcomes. To tackle the obstacle of the computational load, reducing a matrix's dimensions is implemented. It cuts down the number of decision variables, unequal and equal constraints from 90.8%, 99.97%, and 57.81%, respectively.",
