School of Environmental Science and Engineering Tianjin University Tianjin 300072 China Air conditioning systems are generally considered to have the greatest flexibility potential in buildings that can be flexibly regulated with thermal storage to reduce the interaction with the power grid and increase demand response benefits. In previous studies, the flexibility of air-conditioning systems was reflected through time-of-use tariffs. However, a strategy that only factors the tariffs incurs a greater operational energy consumption. In this study, a flexibility factor was established and incorporated into the multi-objective optimization process, together with the operational energy consumption, as two optimization objectives. After obtaining typical load patterns using a two-step clustering method, for multi-objective decision-making in the day-ahead operation, the entropy-grey technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution method is used. Considering an office building as a case study, we found that the optimized flexibility factor can reach 0.31 and 0.99 during a week of operation in winter and summer, on average, respectively, and achieved a cumulative energy-saving effect of 17.98% and 35.49%. In addition, the two-step clustering method can better demonstrate the flexibility factor than the single-step clustering. Keywords Two-step clustering Load pattern recognition Flexibility factor Operation strategy 1 Introduction Building energy consumption accounts for nearly 40% of global energy consumption [1]. In the United States, the building sector consumes more than 70% of the total electricity [2], while in Europe, public buildings account for 11% of the total energy consumption [3]. Buildings, which are major energy consumers, impose a tremendous strain on modern grids. The goal of the demand response is to improve the flexible energy use in buildings, reduce the load during the peak load time, and increase the load demand during the off-peak load time. Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems are deemed promising for promoting flexible electricity use in buildings, especially when integrated with thermal energy storage technology [4]. To rationally manage building energy equipment, it is necessary to first examine building energy demands. Based on the building load curves, the characteristics and regularity of the load variation can be clearly demonstrated [5]. The purpose of the load analysis is to determine the energy consumption characteristics of customers, comprehend changing patterns in the energy demand, and optimize energy services such as demand response or energy efficiency initiatives. The main methods of building load forecasting include (1) white-box, (2) grey-box, and (3) black-box methods. The white-box method [6] uses detailed physical data to compute the building energy consumption, such as using simulation software and numerical calculations. The grey-box method [7,8] is based on the coupling of statistical methods and physical models. The modelling process combines the advantages of black-box and white-box models, reducing the need for the amount of input data and decreasing the computation time. The black-box method uses historical building load data and factors affecting the load as input data. The relevant research methods for obtaining building loads and the characteristics of the methods are summarized in Table 1 . As shown in the table, data-driven methods are widely used to estimate building energy demand. In addition to the successful prediction of building energy consumption, data-driven methods are widely used for building load classification. Building energy analysis can positively impact the energy use of buildings by quantifying the total energy consumption and sub-energy consumption to obtain the characteristics of building energy use and to guide users and operators. Clustering is a popular method for implementing building heating and cooling load pattern extractions. As an unsupervised method, clustering works well in analyzing data from research and testing, without labeling information to categorize them. Do Carmo [20] used cluster and regression to analyze the daily heating load profiles of 139 Danish dwellings and recorded their hourly energy demand. Jesper [21] developed a data mining method to create normalized annual heat load profiles with a daily resolution for consumers from the commercial, industrial, public, and residential sectors. They discovered a link between the daily heating load curve patterns and socioeconomic characteristics of households. An [22] identified the air conditioner usage patterns in residential buildings through clustering analysis. Usage patterns considering the number of rooms and floor area of different households are useful for understanding the thermal comfort requirements of the inhabitants and reducing air conditioning expenses. Malik [23] used K-means clustering to characterize the cooling load profiles to estimate possible peak load reductions from the air conditioner demand response. They found significant demand response opportunity through peak saving New South Wales homes. The change in the curve shape accurately reflects the release of demand response potential. Calikus [24] used the k-shaped method to group similar heating load profiles and extract representative load patterns to identify building control strategies. Four typical heating modes were obtained by analyzing the heating load data of multi-dwelling buildings, commercial buildings, and industrial buildings. Wang et al. [25] investigated data-driven unsupervised learning techniques to classify district heating users into separate clusters. Users with a heating period similar to that of the industrial sectors are more likely to contribute more to the peak network load. Typical load modes can also improve the heating load forecasting model accuracy. According to data mining studies, the load curve pattern is a direct indication of the load demand characteristics [26], and demand response potentials can be demonstrated from various load curve patterns. YoungPark [27] analyzed energy consumption data for 1910 residential and 1919 non-residential buildings and found that the energy consumption is at its peak at night in most residential buildings and in the morning and midday in non-residential buildings. The fundamental load shape profiles identified can be used as building simulation inputs. The demand response operation of air-conditioning systems enables energy cost reduction, load shifting, and load shedding. Kontu [28] analyzed hourly heating load data from 109 district heating (DH) customers over four years and compared their heating load profiles to those without any demand-side management actions. The results showed that demand-side management actions reduce customers' energy consumption and costs but increase the frequency of short-term thermal load changes. Khoa XuanLe [29] conducted a schedule operation strategy for shifting space heating and hot water demand from peak to off-peak periods based on energy prices, to reduce peak demands and improve system energy efficiency with minimized running costs. Ramos [30] studied a control system of demand-management measures based on the shape of the building load curve and found that the use of the thermal mass of the buildings as thermal storage, such as night ventilation, can reduce the load peak occurrences and achieve better economic results. Swarm intelligence optimization algorithms have been frequently used in recent research because of their fast computational speed and their ability to solve nonlinear energy system optimization problems. The running time of the intelligence optimization algorithm is generally less than 60 s; thus these algorithms can quickly respond to the grid demand and improve grid flexibility with a large proportion of renewable energy [31]. Finck et al. [32] developed a model predictive control (MPC) controller, which performs dynamic optimal control of photo voltaic (PV) and building heating systems. The proposed approach can save energy costs based on the power and heating demands. Li [33] developed a simulation-based multi-objective optimization model for solar hybrid heat pumps with energy storage to perform energy, economic, and environmental analysis. A multi-objective optimization model was proposed, with operation costs and primary energy consumption simultaneously minimized by a genetic algorithm. Yan Du [34] proposed an air conditioning control strategy for a multizone residential HVAC system to minimize energy consumption and ensure users' thermal comfort. The proposed method can adapt to the different thermal needs of users and various pricing mechanisms. The energy storage can improve the performance of the regional cooling and heating systems. Guelpa et al. [35] explored the implementation of thermal energy storage in district heating and cooling systems; such storage facilities can reduce the inefficient operation of some equipment. HVAC equipment flexibility scheduling is based on the demand response signal from the grid. A common regulation signal for HVAC equipment is the time-of-use (TOU) tariff. Yang [36] investigated the optimal operation strategy for an integrated energy system under a TOU price, which can enhance the supply-demand match degree and improve the efficiency of energy utilization. Zhang [37] constructed a two-stage optimization model for an energy system with energy storage. Genetic algorithms and stochastic dynamic programming methods were combined and used in the optimization to meet the users\u2019 thermal demand by fully considering the influence of the TOU electricity price and obtaining the operating plan having the lowest operating cost. From the literature review, although the regularity of building load demand and demand response control has received widespread attention, the load curve pattern reflecting the flexibility potential must be further explored. Most of the previous studies analyze the system operation through typical daily load curves or predicted daily load curves, which is limited owing to the incomplete consideration of various load demands during the cooling and heating seasons [38]. Random changes in the load factors cause numerous load curves with different shapes, and it is impossible to construct similar optimization goals or a universal operation plan [39]. Therefore, it is necessary to summarize and distinguish the types of loads to realize typical scenarios. In addition, most of the research objectives on optimal demand-side scheduling have focused on the operation economy, with some objectives dedicated to maximizing energy storage or minimizing active power losses. For air conditioning systems, the simultaneous achievement of energy-efficient operation and grid demand response is a multi-objective problem, whereas flexibility is seldom considered an optimization objective in multi-objective optimization. To fill the gap, the main contributions of this study are as follows: 1. To address the limitations of single clustering methods for curve dimension identification, a two-step clustering approach based on dynamic time warping (DTW) and K-means was established. The two-step clustering approach performs load pattern recognition from the perspectives of both the magnitude and shape of the load curves and extracts the key load patterns that are closely related to the air conditioning system demand response strategies. Based on the new approach, the peak load reduction and shifting for flexible operation control of the building air-conditioning system can be better realized. 2. To develop flexibility strategies for buildings, the current objectives are mostly focused on economic benefits. However, the flexibility benefits are sometimes not focused on energy efficiency or are even opposed to it, rather than on grid friendliness. In this study, we define the concept of flexibility increment (FI) by converting the time-of-use tariff into building electricity consumption at peak and valley times and subsequently establish the optimization objective together with energy saving. The results obtained can better reflect the overall strategy value by removing the influence of the curve's own shape compared with the optimization that considers only the tariff. 2 Methodology Classifying building load profiles is the premise for an air conditioning operation strategy. In this study, the historical load was subdivided using a two-step clustering method, which enabled establishing the typical pattern of the building load curve. To generate the operation strategy, the air conditioning system was modeled using the grey box method, and the coupling constraints of each energy equipment operation were considered in the modeling process. The operating time and output of the air conditioning system can be easily matched to a certain default strategy by comparing the similarity of the predicted load curve with a typical one, to facilitate system control and maximize the demand response benefits. The non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) was applied to regulate the operation schedule of each piece of equipment, and the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) method was established to make the final decision from the solution set of multi-objective optimization. The logic sequence of the calculations for the different modules is shown in a flowchart in Fig. 1 . 2.1 Load pattern recognition (1) Two-step clustering method In clustering studies, Euclidean distance is often used to measure the similarity between two curves. However, the similarity in the load curve shape does not imply that the Euclidean distance between the two curves is minimal [40]. A two-step clustering method was proposed to simultaneously classify the time-varying trend and load value of the building load curve. The outlier standardization method was used to standardize the building load data. (1) x k → f ( x k ) x k − x min x max − x min where xk is the data to be normalized, xmax is the maximum value of all data, and xmin is the minimum value. After normalizing the data, the loadings are mapped between 0 and 1, making each data in the same order of magnitude and facilitating the comparative analysis of clusters. After standardizing the load curve, the first step is to use the dynamic time warping (DTW) clustering to distinguish the difference in the vector direction. The curve shape characteristics can be thus distinguished. In the second step, based on the load values, further clustering of different types of loads can be obtained. The daily average load of each category from the first clustering step is then calculated by Euclidean distance clustering, and the distribution of the daily average load can be obtained based on the distance difference. The relative calculation formula is as follows: DTW-minimized pairwise distances: (2) D T W ( C , T ) = min ( ∑ l = 1 L d ( c w c ( t ) , t w t ( t ) ) ) Euclidean distance: (3) E 2 = ( x − μ ) ( x − μ ) \u2032 The k-means algorithm was used to determine the number of clusters. The clustering performance can be improved by a reasonable selection of the number of clusters k in the calculation process. The optimal number of cluster centers was determined based on the Calinski-Harabasz (CH) index. The larger the CH value, the more appropriate the clustering result. (4) C H = t r B ( k ) / ( k − 1 ) t r W ( k ) / ( n − k ) where: n-the number of observations. k-the number of clusters trB(k)- the overall between-cluster variance trW(k)- the overall within-cluster variance. (2) K-nearest neighbor classifier The K-nearest neighbor (KNN) method based on supervised learning is one of the top ten algorithms for data mining [41] and in recent years, it has been frequently applied in the energy field to solve problems related to pattern recognition [42,43]. In this study, the KNN method was chosen to solve the nonparametric classification problem. After disassembling the load curve from the two dimensions of the amplitude and shape, a load pattern matrix was obtained. The classification model was trained based on historical load data, which considered four key indicators of the cooling/heating load and the overall shape of the load curve. The following indicators were applied as input data for the KNN classifier: Average daily load ( Q ¯ ): The average value of cooling/heating load. Maximum daily load ( Q max ): The maximum value of cooling/heating load during the day. Load change rate ( Δ Q ): The degree of drastic load change on the reaction study day. Daily load variations were obtained by calculating the average value of the hourly change rate of the load. (5) Δ Q = Q ¯ Q max where: Q max \u2014Maximum daily load, kW, Q ¯ \u2014Average daily load, kW. Peak Load Ratio: The total building cooling and heating load to be met when the electricity price is at its peak, 8:00\u201311:00 and 18:00\u201323:00 for the TOU price in Tianjin. [37]; (6) Q f = Q ¯ p e a k Q max where: Q ¯ p e a k \u2014Average peak load, kW. Variability can be better quantified by the feature recognition of the characteristic index of each load cluster. By training the classifier, the new load profiles can be categorized into existing classes of typical load profiles. Five cross-validations were selected to verify the classification accuracy of the calculated data. 2.2 Air conditioning system operation optimization modeling A cooling/heating supply energy consumption model was developed herein. The detailed modeling process is presented in the Appendix. The multi-objective genetic algorithm II [44] was applied for optimization under different load patterns based on the established model and the electricity price. As one of the most popular multi-objective genetic algorithms, NSGA-II uses a fast non-dominated sorting algorithm, which greatly reduces the computational complexity. After obtaining the Pareto frontier of the multi-objective optimization, the most satisfying solution must be selected from the Pareto frontier. The TOPSIS entropy weight-grey correlation analysis method was used to meet this multi-objective decision-making requirement [45], which comprises three steps. The first step is to select a positive (negative) ideal solution according to the TOPSIS. The second method uses the entropy weight method to ascertain the weight of each indicator. In the final step, by calculating the grey relation degree with the weights from the entropy weight method, the scheme with the highest grey relation degree is selected as the best scheme. 2.2.1 Optimization objectives The International Energy Agency's Energy in Buildings and Communities Program (IEA EBC) Annex67 project defines flexibility as follows: \u201cEnergy Flexibility of a building is the ability to manage its demand and generation according to local climate conditions, user needs, and grid requirements\u201d [46]. The capacity of peak load shifting and the change in the flexibility coefficient before and after optimization mainly reflect the flexibility of the operating strategy of the building air-conditioning system. In this study, flexibility increment (FI) was used to measure and optimize the degree of improvement in system flexibility based on different operating strategies. The flexibility factor (FF), which is used to calculate FI, evaluates the energy shifting ability from periods of high electricity prices to periods of low electricity prices [47].

An FF of 0 indicates that the energy usage is the same at the peak and valley prices. An FF of 1 implies that the device is not used at the peak price; when the FF is −1, the device is not used during the low-price period. The proper use of active storage can improve system efficiency and achieve peak load shifting. Owing to the limited available capacity, there is a conflict between fully utilizing the flexibility and minimizing the operational energy consumption. To find a compromise solution with the highest flexibility and lowest energy consumption during 24 h of operation, the corresponding optimization objectives can be expressed mathematically by equations (9) and (10), respectively.

J2 (Objective 2) is the minimal energy consumption throughout the day. FF is the building air conditioning flexibility factor, FFopt is the FF calculated using the optimized strategy, and FFbaseline is the FF value when only the heat pump is used to supply the building. Qhp1 and Qhp2 are the heating/cooling capacities of the heat pump (HP), and COPt is the COP of the heat pump when it is operating at time t. Ppump and PSTC are the powers of the pump and solar collector system, respectively, when they are operating. The optimization objective is calculated as shown in equation (9), and the constraints to be considered are given in equation (10). The calculation of equipment power is described in detail in Appendix A. 2.2.2 Optimization variables and parameter setting In the initial setting of the genetic algorithm corresponding to the optimization of the air conditioning system operation problem, the number of variables is 33. Specific definitions of these parameters are presented in Table 2 . The number of optimization objectives is set to 2, and the population is set to 1000. To ensure that the population can converge to the Pareto front as much as possible, the number of iterations of the algorithm is set to 10,000. Multi-core processors and GPUs are used to execute algorithms in batches. The programming work is implemented in Matlab (2021a), with an Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8700H CPU @3.20 GHZ 3.19 GHZ, 16.00 random access memory computer. All calculations are completed within 0.36\u20130.60 s. 3 Case study To verify the demand response benefits due to flexible operation strategy, an office building in Tianjin, China, was selected as the case building. The four-story building had an area of 4953.4 m2 and a height of 22.7 m. The building's air-conditioning system was turned on at 7:00 a.m. and off at 23:00 on the night. The structure of the energy system in the case building is shown in Fig. 2 . During operation, the solar thermal collector system (STC) can provide heat to the building in the winter through a direct supply, or in combination with a ground source heat pump. In summer, the thermal tank can be used for cooling through the heat pump or use the tank to store cold water at night. The model of the system equipment is presented in Table 3 . Data were recorded hourly using an energy consumption platform and manual testing. The heating and cooling load of the office building were measured on-site for two winters (2017.1.1\u20132017.2.20 and 2017.12.1\u20132018.1.31) and two summers (2017.6.15\u20132017.8.30 and 2018.7.1\u20132018.8.13). The solar radiation data were obtained from a weather station (TRM-ZS2) installed on the roof of the building for testing. The weather station could collect total solar plane radiation, direct solar radiation, solar scattering, and other related weather data. The water temperature and flow rate were collected by CRL-G ultrasonic heat meter. The temperature range was 4\u2013130 °C. The measurement accuracy was 0.01 m3/h for instantaneous flow rate and 0.0001 °C for water temperature. The power consumption of the equipment was obtained from the energy monitoring platform. Two commonly used operating strategies during the actual operation were found from the historical operating data of the system: in Strategy 1, only the HP unit was used to meet the heating and cooling load demand from 8:00 to 23:00. In Strategy 2, the water tank was used for heat storage at night from 23:00 to 7:00 the next day, releasing the stored heat to the building together with the HP unit during working hours. The rates of heat storage and release from the water tank were constant. The peak time of tariff in Tianjin is 23:00\u20137:00, the flat time is 7:00\u20138:00 ∖11:00\u201318:00, and the valley time is 8:00\u201311:00 ∖18:00\u201323:00 [48]. 4 Results and discussion 4.1 Classified building load patterns In the first clustering step, the historical load data were organized in a matrix after filling out the missing data and normalization. The K-means algorithm based on cosine similarity was used for clustering, and load curves with similar morphologies were grouped together. The optimal number of clusters was determined when the CH value was highest. Based on the CH value, the optimal results were three clusters for the building heating load and two for the building cooling load. The classified building load based on morphology in the first step of clustering is shown in Fig. 3 . In Fig. 3, the shape of the building load curve is assumed to be affected by variations in outdoor weather conditions and occupant activities [19]. With regard to the heating load clusters, cluster 1 often occurred on warm, sunny days. Except for the morning and evening peaks, valleys usually occurred during the day. The curve for cluster 2 was relatively smooth. Owing to the small temperature difference between the indoor and outdoor environments throughout the day, the heating load was small. The peaks of cluster 3 were likely to occur because of occupant activities in the morning and afternoon. For the cooling load curves in Fig. 3(b), the peak occurrence times of the two clusters were different, with the peak load of cluster 1 appearing later than that of cluster 2 and being smaller overall. The magnitude of the building load curve is focused on the K-means algorithm based on the Euclidean distance in second-step clustering. The results obtained after the second clustering step are shown in Fig. 4 . In the second step of clustering, each type of load can be divided into three subclasses. In the case building, nine types of standard load curves were obtained in winter and six in summer by combining the shape and amplitude of the curve. The clustering centers were used as representative curves of each cluster for the boundary condition setting of the operation strategy. To highlight the advantages of the proposed method, the two-step clustering method has been compared with the single-step Euclidean distance-based K-means method. The within-cluster sums of the point-to-centroid distances of the load curves obtained using the two methods are shown in Fig. 5 . In Fig. 5, the radius of the bubbles is the sum of the interclass distances of each cluster. The load cluster of one-step clustering is shown as blue bubbles, and the red bubbles obtained by two-step clustering represent the three clusters obtained in the first step. The inter-class distances of single-step clustering were relatively large, indicating that the operational strategy generated based on such cluster centers was inadequate to cover most of the load scenarios in the cluster. In two-step clustering, the mean values of the load were different, with the load clusters divided by shape. Hence, two-step clustering can describe a diversified load scenario with greater detail and accuracy than single-step clustering. The two-step clustering method aims to obtain a representative cooling and heating load profile to guide the demand response of an air-conditioning system. To implement the demand response, the peak load amplitude must be reduced, and it must be shifted to valley periods. Therefore, distinguishing load patterns of different sizes and peak-to-valley differences in detail facilitates the development of an instructive operational regulation strategy. 4.2 Optimal strategies under typical load patterns Based on the heating/cooling load demand, the energy supply strategy of each device was optimized, as shown in Figs. 6 and 7 , in which the blue line shows the stored heating and cooling capacities of the water tank, respectively. It can be observed from Figs. 6 and 7 that the recommended operating strategies under different load demands are quite different. In winter, HP2 unit with a larger capacity can be frequently used, particularly when the heating load is relatively high and stable. The small unit, HP1, is rarely used only when a valley occurs at noon in the heating load curve. Heat storage is applied only in the following three instances: 1) to meet the valley load demand when the peak\u2013valley load difference is significant, 2) to be combined with the smaller heat pump unit when the electricity price is at the peak or flat period, and 3) to supplement the larger heat pump unit's contribution when the heating load is beyond its capacity. During most of the summer time, the small HP unit was adequate to meet the cooling load demand of the building. Flexibility is a crucial factor affecting the mode of operation during summer. The stored heat at night was prioritized for release in the peak electricity price period, while the remaining heat was used as a supplement for the HP units in the flat and valley price periods. The influence of the heat storage tank on the flexibility of the heat pump air conditioning system is vital for handling the heating/cooling load, and the electricity consumption profile of the air conditioning system before and after strategy optimization is shown in Fig. 8 . The light background represents the peak electricity price, and the dark background represents the flat and valley prices. The portion between the two curves represents the amount of electricity shifted after optimization. The results in Fig. 8 indicate that using the optimized operating strategy, a substantial reduction in the daytime load is achieved. Load shedding occurred during the peak electricity price and valley load periods. The energy storage during the valley electricity price period in the nighttime reflects the flexibility of the air-conditioning system through load shifting. However, the heat storage function was reduced under a relatively low heating/cooling load during the daytime or an insignificant peak-valley difference in the load curve. The flexibility of the heat storage equipment in the air conditioning system is owing to two aspects: on the one hand, when the heating load is small, it reduces the use of HP units by satisfying the heating load demand independently; on the other hand, it shifts the excess load at the peak price period in the daytime to nighttime. Although the flexible operation of energy systems can be realized by the consideration of TOU tariffs, the operational efficiency of the energy system cannot be guaranteed. Therefore, flexibility and energy efficiency should be comprehensively considered in the operational strategy. 4.3 Operation benefit analysis The proposed operational strategy was validated using classified building load curves obtained from the two-step clustering model. The one-week building load was randomly selected from the test data for winter and summer. The pattern-recognition results are presented in Table 4 . Table 4 shows that all the daily load curves successfully matched the specific typical load pattern. According to the training data, the accuracy of the two-step clustering model was 94.2%, while the accuracy of the single-step clustering model was 90.4%. A comparison of the operating strategies corresponding to certain load patterns will enable the calculation of operating energy consumption and operating costs. In addition to classification accuracy, a more important advantage of two-step clustering than single-step clustering lies in the accurate identification of load demand targets. Using single-step clustering, some of the operating strategies for curve clusters with smaller or larger load demand may be missed (e.g., cluster1-1, cluster1-2, cluster3-3 in Fig. 6, or cluster2-3 in Fig. 7), and the curves with similar load magnitudes but different shapes may be incorrectly identified as belonging to the same category (e.g., cluster1-2 and cluster2-3 in Fig. 6, which differ in the application mode of the energy storage device at noon). The two-step clustering not only provides a more refined division of the load curve patterns but also improves the comprehensiveness and predictability of the operation strategies in response to the load demand variation. (1) Operation benefits of different strategies To compare the operational benefits of the previous operation strategy and the optimized strategy, the energy savings and load-shifting effects are shown in Fig. 9 . HPmode represents the operation mode using only the heat pump units, while ESmode represents the operation mode using both the energy storage system and the heat pump units. The heating/cooling energy was stored at a maximum capacity during the night and released in equal amounts every hour during the daytime. In Fig. 9, SS-Optmode depicts the operational strategy with single-step clustering, and TS-Optmode represents the operational strategy with two-step clustering. Overall, adopting the TS-Optmode strategy reduced both the operational cost and energy consumption compared with the previous strategies. Compared with HPmode, the TS-Optmode strategy could reduce the operation cost by 26.58% and 56.74% in winter and summer, respectively. Compared with ESmode, the TS-Optmode strategy achieved cost savings of 31.3% and 47.78%, respectively, in winter and summer. Additionally, TS-Optmode could also realize an energy-saving effect of 17.98% in winter and 35.49% in summer compared with HPmode, and 28.73% in winter and 40.82% in summer compared with ESmode. The heat loss of ESmode energy storage led to higher operating energy consumption and costs than those of HPmode. Furthermore, compared with SS-Optmode, the TS-Optmode strategy could reduce the operation cost by 165.2 RMB and 629.8 RMB per week in winter and summer, respectively. The TS-Optmode strategy could balance the deployment of heat pump units and energy storage units, thus yielding the maximum benefits. (2) Flexibility evaluation Fig. 10 shows the flexibility factors of each strategy. The optimized operation strategy could obtain a higher FFmode, regardless of winter or summer. The average flexibility of the optimized TS-Optmode increased by 0.25 compared with HPmode and 0.12 compared with ESmode in winter, while it increased by 0.82 compared with HPmode and 0.34, compared with ESmode in summer. Compared to SS-Optmode, the TS-Optmode strategy could increase the average flexibility by 0.01 and 0.12, respectively, in winter and summer. Although ESmode maximized the storage heat at night, owing to the absence of heat release management, neither the operation cost nor the peak electricity load could be reduced. Driven by the electricity price, a heat storage tank could be used to shift the peak cooling/heating load. Therefore, the operation strategy, after optimization, can improve operational flexibility. It was also found that FF could be close to 1 in summer but just 0.3 in winter, because FF is influenced by both the shape and amplitude of the load curve. As the total cooling load was relatively small in summer and heat storage accounted for a large proportion of the total cooling capacity, the bulk of the electricity consumption of the air conditioning system could be shifted at peak times. However, the total heating load at the peak electricity price was relatively large, resulting in higher electricity consumption at the peak price than at the valley price. Flexibility was affected by two factors. The first was the overlap ratio between the shape of the heating/cooling load curve and TOU price. If a higher load demand occurred at the peak price, the FF value was low. The second was energy-storage equipment. The more frequent use of energy storage for load shifting resulted in better flexibility. 5 Conclusion This study proposes a two-step clustering method for building load recognition and a multi-objective optimization method that considers flexibility to regulate the operation of an air conditioning system and achieve demand response benefits. Considering an office building as an example, the air-conditioning system of the building was modeled, and the optimal operational strategy was obtained according to the load curve patterns of the building. The following conclusions were drawn from this study: For the load patterns of buildings, the two-step clustering method, based on DTW-minimized pairwise distances and Euclidean distance, was used to obtain the typical load patterns of buildings with morphological distinction and size distinction simultaneously. Compared to single-step clustering alone by K-means based on Euclidean distance, two-step clustering has obvious advantages in terms of the operational benefits obtained through the planning operation strategy. Analyzing the impact of the shape of the curve on flexibility, if the energy storage can reduce both cooling and heating load and minimize the operation of equipment, the operating strategy will have better flexibility and operational benefits. Considering that energy storage cannot cover the entire cooling and heating load demand of a building, a better flexibility effect can be obtained when the valley of the cooling and heating loads coincides with the peak price of electricity. The potential for the flexibility of the operating strategy was found to be greater in summer than in winter. The results of the one-week validation show that the average flexibility factors were 0.31 in winter and 0.99 in summer. For air conditioning systems with energy storage, the rational application of active energy storage has a positive effect on the operation cost. Overall, the TS-optmode strategy can reduce the operational cost by 26.58% and 56.74% in winter and summer, and can achieve energy savings of 17.98% and 35.49% in winter and summer, respectively. The TS-optmode strategy considers the power grid and equipment efficiency, which is suitable for achieving a solution for the demand response of a building HVAC system with energy storage equipment. In future research, an exclusive description method for the building load shape characteristics will be discussed in depth. In addition, the impact of demand response measures on the building load profile and flexibility offered by different types of energy equipment will be investigated.

Coupling operation of devices The device groups with interrelated characteristics in the system are as follows: (1) When HP 1 is on, its power consumption and the power consumed by the associated ground source-side circulation pump and the user-side circulation pump must be considered. For calculation purposes, it was assumed that the corresponding circulating water pump operated at a fixed frequency. (2) When using a solar thermal collector, the power consumption of the solar circulating pump must be considered. For calculation purposes, it was assumed that the corresponding circulating pump operated at a fixed frequency. (3) When the water tank is used for direct supply or an auxiliary ground source heat pump for energy supply, the power consumption of the water tank must be considered. For calculation purposes, it was assumed that the corresponding circulating pump operated at a variable frequency. (2) Constraints Furthermore, the energy constraints of the model were considered. Owing to water tank, night and day were considered separately. a. Night constraints (1) In the process of heat storage at night, the total heat storage of the water tank must be less than the maximum heat capacity that the water tank can hold. (2) The heat stored in the water tank per hour must be less than or equal to the maximum heat production of the HP unit used for heat storage at that hour. (3) The hourly heat supply of the ground source-side heat pump unit must be less than the maximum heat supply of the HP unit. (4) The hourly maximum heat supply of the HP unit must be greater than the minimum heat supply of the HP unit under normal operation. Usually, the minimum load of the HP unit under normal operation is 0.3 times the maximum output [49]. b. Day constraints (1) During the day, the heat in the water tank must always be greater than zero during discharge. (2) The total heat supply to the system must be greater than or equal to the heating load of the building. Because the optimization problem needs to find the minimum energy consumption and minimum operating cost, the maximum energy consumption is not constrained in the optimization. This can increase the algorithm effeciency by reducing the constraints . (3) The heat supply of the HP unit is less than the maximum heat supply of the unit. (4) The heat supply of the HP unit is greater than the minimum heat supply during the normal operation of the HP unit. The operating model constraints of the air-conditioning system can be described as follows: Appendix B Optimization algorithm selection Because there is no real pareto front for energy system optimization problems, for algorithm selection, the following factors are considered: whether the algorithm can find a better solution to the problem and whether the solution is robust after multiple calculations, that is, whether the difference between the results obtained after performing multiple calculations is small. Five multi-objective optimization algorithms were selected: NSGA-II, MOPSO, ARMOEA, GrEA, and NSGAIISDR. Figs. 11 and 12 display the results of each algorithm after 30 runs in a real problem. Fig. 11 Distribution of solutions for objective 1 Fig. 11 Fig. 12 Distribution of solutions for objective 2 Fig. 12 From the results of Figs. 11 and 12, it was found that the NSGA-II algorithm demonstrated better generalization and performance in solving energy system optimization problems. The distribution of the solutions was stable and resulted in better operational strategies. Therefore, the NSGA-II algorithm was used in this study to solve the practical system optimization problems. References [1] A. Bampoulas M. Saffari F. Pallonetto E. Mangina D.P.

        "dc:description": "Air conditioning systems are generally considered to have the greatest flexibility potential in buildings that can be flexibly regulated with thermal storage to reduce the interaction with the power grid and increase demand response benefits. In previous studies, the flexibility of air-conditioning systems was reflected through time-of-use tariffs. However, a strategy that only factors the tariffs incurs a greater operational energy consumption. In this study, a flexibility factor was established and incorporated into the multi-objective optimization process, together with the operational energy consumption, as two optimization objectives. After obtaining typical load patterns using a two-step clustering method, for multi-objective decision-making in the day-ahead operation, the entropy-grey technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution method is used. Considering an office building as a case study, we found that the optimized flexibility factor can reach 0.31 and 0.99 during a week of operation in winter and summer, on average, respectively, and achieved a cumulative energy-saving effect of 17.98% and 35.49%. In addition, the two-step clustering method can better demonstrate the flexibility factor than the single-step clustering.",
