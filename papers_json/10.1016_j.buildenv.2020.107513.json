Indoor chemical reactions with human surfaces can meaningfully affect indoor pollutant dynamics and human exposure to reactants and products. Computational Fluid Dynamics models have been used to simulate ozone-human surface reactions in indoor environments. However, the model uncertainties due to near-human grid size and turbulence model are not well understood. The objective of this study is to assess performance of turbulence models and near-human surface grids in predicting local airflow and ozone transport near the human surface under a representative range of indoor airflow conditions. The results show that Large Eddy Simulation (LES) with a fine near-human grid size (e.g., y+ = 1) can yield reasonable results of airflow and mass transfer near the body. The SST k\u2013ω model performs well for the simulation of near-human airspeed, whereas the standard k\u2013ε model can predict lower airspeeds above the human head than the measurements. Both standard k\u2013ε and SST k\u2013ω models may underestimate the turbulent kinetic energy of the thermal plume and ozone deposition velocity at the human surface. The results also suggest that near-human grid sizes of y+ >10 can lead to unreasonable estimates of airflow and mass transfer rate near the human surface. Keywords Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) Large eddy simulation (LES) Grid sensitivity Ozone reaction Indoor chemistry Deposition velocity 1 Introduction The chemical reactions between indoor oxidants and human surfaces (skin, hair and clothing) influence pollutant distribution and chemistry in occupied spaces [1\u20137]. For example, ozone can react with human skin oil that contains unsaturated organic compounds such as squalene and unsaturated fatty acids [1,5]. Such reactions generate primary ozonolysis products including acetone, 6-MHO and geranyl acetone. Some of these primary products can react further with ozone to form secondary ozonolysis products such as 4-OPA [1]. Previous studies [3\u20136] measured ozone consumption and byproduct emissions at indoor surfaces and revealed that the human surface is a dominant contributor to ozone removal and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) generation. Another study [7] reported that the ozone concentration in the human breathing zone can be notably lower than the bulk room level due to the ozone reaction with human skin and clothing, which in turn results in relatively high concentrations of reaction products in the breathing zone than the bulk room air. Previous studies reported the impact of indoor airflow on the ozone-human surface reaction. The mass transport of ozone to the reactive human surface is sensitive to the air movement in the vicinity of the body [2,3,6\u20138]. Rai et al. [3] revealed that increased ventilation rate results in higher ozone removal and product emission rates. Won et al. [8] showed that enhanced indoor air mixing can facilitate the ozone reactions with human surfaces. In addition to the indoor airflow, human surface type is another key factor for the ozone reactions [2\u20134,9]. Coleman et al. [4] reported that the ozone deposition velocity on clothing ranges from 4.0 to 16.6 m/h with various clothing materials and soiling conditions (e.g., laundered vs. soiled). Given the implications of ozone-human surface reactions in human exposure to ozone and reaction products, researchers have used computer models to examine breathing zone concentrations [2,7,8,10\u201312]. The advantage of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) method is that it can provide detailed, non-uniform distributions of pollutants near the body without having human subject tests and perform the parametric analysis to examine a role of a specific parameter in the system [13]. On the other hand, CFD simulations present uncertainties associated with computational grids, boundary conditions and physical models. Since the ozone-human surface reactions are sensitive to the mass and heat transfers in the human surface boundary layer [6,7], it is crucial to apply adequately fine grids and appropriate near-wall treatment (e.g., wall function) at the human surfaces [2,11,12,14\u201320]. Rim et al. [2] conducted a grid sensitivity analysis to verify the CFD model of the ozone reaction with human surfaces. The study results showed that the simulation with an average dimensionless wall distance (y+ value) of 10 at the human surface underpredicts 24.3% of the ozone deposition velocity than the case with y+ = 5. However, few studies have explored the impact of the near-human grid size on the ozone-human surface reactions under a range of indoor airflow conditions. Besides, numerous CFD studies showed that the selection of the turbulence model can meaningfully affect the calculated indoor airflow and buoyancy-driven thermal plumes around the human body [14,19\u201326]; however, little information is available on how the turbulence model influences the mass and heat transfer of reactive gases near the human surfaces. Furthermore, although the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) has been attempted for the indoor airflow calculations [27\u201330], very few studies assessed its performance in predicting airflow and mass transfer in near-human microenvironments. Table 1 summarizes previous studies that employed various turbulence models and near-human grid sizes for the investigation of ozone-human surface reactions. However, the model uncertainties associated with the turbulence model and near-human grid are not well understood. Given this background, the objective of the present study is to evaluate the performance of near-human surface grids and turbulence models in simulating ozone reaction with human surface under a representative range of indoor airflow conditions. The study results will provide quality assurance criteria and guide modelers in selecting appropriate near-human grid size and turbulence model when simulating airflow and mass transport in near-human microenvironments. 2 Method We have established a three-dimensional CFD model that simulates ozone reaction with human surface in indoor environments to examine the effects of the computational grids and turbulence models on prediction of mass transfer rate near the human body as described below. 2.1 Description of the CFD model Fig. 1 shows the model geometry that simulates the transport of air and ozone near an occupant in a ventilated room with the room dimension of 4 × 4 × 3.63 m. The model represents a typical residential room or small office with a detailed geometry of a seated person (surface area = 1.58 m2) positioned at the center of the floor. The total heat flux from the occupant (53 W/m2) was divided into convective and radiative portions of 45% and 55% respectively based on previous studies [31,32]. The convective heat was applied to the human surface as Neumann thermal boundary condition, while the radiative portion was distributed to the surrounding wall surfaces [33]. The supply ozone concentration from the inlet was set to 100 ppb. As previous experiments reported a fairly high ozone reactivity and low ozone concentration at the human surface [4\u20136], this study treated zero ozone concentration at the human surface as a perfect sink [2,11] and examined the ozone concentration gradient near the human body. Note that this study focuses on the CFD model uncertainties in modeling the airflow and transport-limited ozone mass transfer near the human surface. Previous studies have measured or modeled ozonolysis product yields [2\u20136]; therefore, using the results of the present study and product yields provided in the previous studies, one can assess the model accuracy in predicting product emissions for different human surface types. To investigate the impact of the ventilation condition, we simulated two representative indoor ventilation strategies: displacement and mixing ventilation [34]. Fig. 1 presents the streamlines of air entering the ventilated room and age-of-air (air freshness) distribution. In the displacement ventilation case, conditioned air was supplied through a low momentum diffuser at the floor level with a relatively low air speed at 0.1 m/s (see Fig. 1a). For the mixing ventilation, the supply air was introduced through a large momentum diffuser at ceiling height with an average inlet velocity at 2 m/s (see Fig. 1b). The supply air temperature was set to 17 °C for both cases. To examine the effect of the ventilation rate, two air change rates of 0.5 and 5 h−1 (corresponding to supply air flow rates of 29 and 290 m3/h, respectively) were applied to both ventilation strategies, resulting in a total of four ventilation conditions. The air change rate of 0.5 h−1 is typical for residential buildings while the case with a ventilation rate of 5 h−1 represents offices conditioned with mechanical ventilation systems such as variable air volume (VAV) system or dedicated outdoor air system [35]. 2.2 Impact of near-human grid resolution Fig. 2 describes three computational grids to test how the near-human grid resolution affects the prediction of ozone transport near the human surface. The first cell sizes adjacent to the human surface are 0.5 mm (Grid 1), 10 mm (Grid 2), and 20 mm (Grid 3), with a cell growth rate of 1.1. Note that the corresponding average y+ values of the human surface are 1, 10, and 20, respectively. The first cell sizes of other wall surfaces were maintained as 10 mm with a cell growth rate of 1.2. The meshes were refined in the vicinity of the inlet and exhaust to enhance the calculation accuracy in the grid-sensitive regions. Polyhedral mesh was used due to its flexibility with the complex human geometry and potential to yield reasonable accuracy with a reduced computational load [36]. The total cell numbers are 530,000 for Grid 1, 270,000 for Grid 2 and 70,000 for Grid 3, respectively. Note that the surface mesh of human body for Grid 3 is coarser than Grid 1 and Grid 2 to maintain a reasonable aspect ratio of first cell layer adjacent to the human surface [37]. The minimum surface cell size is 5 mm for Grid 1 and Grid 2, and is 20 mm for Grid 3. However, as shown in Fig. 2, the human surface mesh of Grid 3 can still capture the general shape of the human body, although it is less detailed for some complex body parts such as hands and ears. The human surface areas are 1.54 m2 for Grid 3 and 1.58 m2 for other two cases, which leads to deviations in the calculated ozone deposition velocity <3%. Therefore, we adjusted the surface area when calculating the deposition velocity and confirmed that it marginally affects ozone mass transfer rate near the human body. The CFD models employed hybrid wall boundary condition that applies near-wall treatment depending on the first grid size of the surfaces [37]. For the surfaces with first grid size y+ < 1, the governing equations were directly resolved throughout the boundary layer without applying any wall functions. At the surfaces with first grid size y+ > 30, the standard log-law wall functions were applied to model the airflow and heat transfers near the wall [38]. If 1 < y+ < 30, the blended wall functions based on Reichardt's law [39] and Kader's law [40] were employed. 2.3 Evaluation of the turbulence model Considering computational resources and engineering applications these days, we investigated the performance of three turbulence models in simulating the ozone-human surface reactions: 1) Reynolds Averaged Navier\u2013Stokes (RANS) with standard k\u2013ε model, 2) RANS with Shear Stress Transport (SST) k\u2013ω model, and 3) Large Eddy Simulation (LES). The standard k\u2013ε turbulence model [41] is one of the most widely used models for indoor airflow simulations due to its wide applications and good computational economy [21]. This study applied two-layer approach to the standard k\u2013ε model to improve the calculation accuracy of near-wall airflow [42]. The SST k\u2013ω model [43] is another popular turbulence model for indoor environment simulations due to its good performance in predicting the stratified airflow associated with thermal plumes of heat sources [44\u201346]. Compared to the RANS approach, the LES model captures more dynamic turbulent flow features with a higher computational load, and it has the potential to yield more realistic flow fluctuations of turbulent indoor airflow [21,22,27,47]. For the application of LES, this study employed the Wall Adapting Local Eddy-Viscosity (WALE) subgrid scale model [48]. The WALE model accounts for both the local strain and rotation rates of turbulent eddies and can calculate a proper asymptotic behavior of eddy-viscosity for the wall-bounded flows without dynamic procedure; therefore, it is less sensitive to the non-universal model coefficient and is more suitable for models with complex geometries compared to other subgrid scale models [37,48,49]. The second-order bounded central differencing scheme was used for the momentum convection term. The simulations were run with time step of 0.5 s until mean flow stabilized and then averaged for 1200 s. We used a commercial CFD solver Star-CCM + to perform the simulations. The SIMPLE algorithm was applied for pressure-velocity coupling. The three-dimensional convection-diffusion mass transfer equation was used to compute the ozone transport and second-order discretization schemes were adopted for the convective terms [50]: (1) ∇ ⋅ ( ρ u C ) = ∇ ⋅ ( D e f f ∇ C ) + S c where ρ is the density of fluid, u is the fluid velocity vector, C is the ozone concentration, D e f f is the effective diffusion coefficient including molecular and turbulent diffusions and S c is the source or sink of ozone. To quantify the influence of the computational grid and turbulence model on the mass transfer rate at the human surface, we calculated the ozone deposition velocity for each case using the following equation [2]: (2) v d = Q ( C s − C e x ) C b × A h where, v d is the ozone deposition velocity (m/h), Q is the supply air flow rate (m3/h), C s is the supply ozone concentration (ppb), C e x is the exhaust ozone concentration (ppb), C b is the ozone concentration of the bulk air (ppb) and A h is the human surface area (m2). The bulk air ozone concentration ( C b ) was calculated based on the averaged concentration of the surface within a 1 m radius from the human. Note that this study does not model the respiratory airflow or the ozone reactions with chemicals from human breath. Instead, we assume that the inhaled air is derived primarily from the rising thermal plume. The breathing zone concentration was calculated as the volume-averaged concentration over a 500 cm3 air volume below the nose tip [7]. This is consistent with findings that (1) the thickness of the plume at nose level reaches up to 0.015 m in front of the body [32], and (2) the inhaled concentration can be measured with sufficient accuracy (<5%) without breathing simulation if the sampling location is < 0.01 m from the upper lip [51]. Furthermore, other studies [1,8] reported that the ozone reaction rates with exhaled chemicals are one order of magnitude lower than the rates of ozone-human surface reactions; therefore, the human breathing has marginal influence on the ozone distribution near the human surface. 3 Results and discussion The study results are organized into two sections. Section 3.1 presents the effects of near-human grid size and turbulence model on the airflow in the near-human microenvironments. Section 3.2 evaluates the performance of the turbulence model and near-human grid in predicting the mass transfer near the human surface. 3.1 Airflow fields near the human body Fig. 3 a\u2013e compare the airflow near the human body under displacement ventilation while varying computational grid and turbulence model. The buoyancy-driven thermal plume is generated near the human body due to the temperature gradient between human surface and ambient air. Under the effect of thermal plume, airspeed is the highest above the head and this phenomenon agrees with previous studies [31,52,53]. Fig. 3a\u2013c illustrate the influence of near-human grid size on the shape and intensity of the thermal plume. The peak airspeed above the human head is 0.32 m/s, 0.30 m/s and 0.23 m/s for cases with an average y+ of human surface as 1 (Grid 1), 10 (Grid 2) and 20 (Grid 3). These results reflect that coarser near-human grids tend to underestimate the intensity of thermal plume. It is likely caused by the use of wall functions at the surfaces where y+>1, as a previous study revealed that the application of wall functions may diminish the accuracy of heat transfer calculation in the near-wall region [54]. The results based on standard k\u2013ε and Large Eddy Simulation (LES) models also show a similar trend (see Fig. S1 in supporting information). Fig. 3a, d and e show the impact of turbulence model on the airflow prediction. Comparing to the SST k\u2013ω model (Fig. 3a), standard k\u2013ε model predicts a lower airspeed above the head with a maximum airspeed of 0.27 m/s (Fig. 3d). This is mainly because the two models use different formulations to estimate near-wall turbulent structures. The standard k\u2013ε model with two-layer approach simulates the turbulent dissipation rate and turbulent viscosity as a function of wall distance, while the SST k\u2013ω model solves two partial differential equations (for turbulence kinetic energy and specific rate of dissipation) throughout the wall boundary layer [42,43]. Similar comparison results between these two turbulence models were observed by others [45,46]. For the LES model (Fig. 3e), the peak airspeed above the head is 0.29 m/s and a higher ambient airspeed (0.05\u20130.10 m/s) is observed than that of RANS models (0.01\u20130.07 m/s). The possible reason is that LES can capture more flow transient fluctuations that result in a stronger redistribution of flow momentum [55]. Fig. 4 shows the vertical airspeed profiles above the head under displacement ventilation. The airspeed is calculated as the averaged value for a circular area with a diameter of 0.1 m at each height. The airspeed increases with height under the effects of thermal plume [2,53]. For Grid 1 (human surface grid size y+ = 1), the SST k\u2013ω and LES models yield similar airspeed profiles, whereas the standard k\u2013ε model predicts a lower airspeed. The cases with a larger human surface cell size (y+ = 10, Grid 2) simulate a notably smaller airspeed for all turbulence models. Previous experiments [7,56] reported an airspeed range of 0.20\u20130.25 m/s at 0.25 m above the head (see the green line in Fig. 4). In the present study, this airspeed of SST k\u2013ω and LES models with human surface gird size y+ = 1 (Grid 1) is 0.22 and 0.23 m/s, respectively, which agrees well with the measurements. However, the standard k\u2013ε model with y+ = 1 predicts a value of 0.18 m/s, which is about 10% lower than the experimental data. The simulations with y+ = 10 (Grid 2) estimate the airspeeds as about 0.15 m/s with a 25% deviation from the experiments. A previous study [2] also shows that the simulated airspeed above the human head notably deviates from the measurements with human surface cell size y+ = 13. These results suggest that with sufficiently fine near-human grid (e.g., y+ = 1), the SST k\u2013ω and LES models can provide reasonable calculations of near-human airspeed field. However, the standard k\u2013ε model predicts a lower airspeed than the experiments and the deviation can be bigger with a larger near-human cell size. Fig. 5 presents the contours of turbulent kinetic energy near the human body based on the SST k\u2013ω and LES models. Note that the turbulent kinetic energy with the LES is calculated as the combination of resolved and subgrid scale parts. This figure reveals that the selection of turbulence model has notable effects on the turbulent flow structure and kinetic energy distribution near the human body. The turbulent kinetic energy is the highest above the head due to the fully turbulent airflow developed by the thermal plume. The SST k\u2013ω model predicts the peak turbulent kinetic energy above the head as 3.7 J/g, which is 56% smaller than the LES result (8.5 J/g). This difference is attributed to that LES captures more transient large eddies than the RANS approach. These results agree with a previous study [22] that compared the performance of the SST k\u2013ω and LES models in predicting natural convection flow. They reported that the SST k\u2013ω model calculates a lower Reynolds stress than the experimental data due to an underprediction of turbulent kinetic energy, while the LES results are in better agreement with the measurements. Taken together, the comparisons between the simulated airflow and other experimental studies reveal that the LES model yields more accurate predictions of the airflow and turbulence in the near-human microenvironment than RANS approaches. The SST k\u2013ω model also shows good performance in the calculation of time-averaged airspeed near a human, whereas it cannot capture the detailed flow eddies of the thermal plume. The results of the standard k\u2013ε model have larger deviations from the measurements than the LES and SST k\u2013ω models. For the grid sensitivity analysis, an average y+ value for the human surface of 1 can yield reasonable results of near-human airflow. However, a larger near-human cell size (e.g., y+>10) can markedly underestimate airspeed compared to actual experiments. 3.2 Mass transfer near the human body Knowing how the turbulence model and grid resolution affect the airflow in the near-human microenvironment, Fig. 6 a\u2013e presents the spatial ozone distributions in the room depending on the near-human grid size and turbulence model. Under displacement ventilation, the ozone-laden supply air is transported upwards by the thermal plume while reacting with the human surface, resulting in a vertical gradient of ozone concentration in the room. Similar ozone distribution patterns have been observed in previous studies [2,8]. Fig. 6a\u2013c indicate that the near-human grid size influences the ozone distribution and coarser grids predict a lower ozone mass transfer to the human surface, thereby resulting in a higher ambient ozone concentration. The simulation with the SST k\u2013ω model and human surface grid size y+ = 1 (Fig. 6a) calculates an ozone concentration reduction from 100 ppb at supply air to 69 ppb at the room exhaust, while the case with y+ = 20 (Fig. 6c) estimates an exhaust ozone concentration as 77 ppb. This result is mainly because a larger near-human surface grid size yields a lower airspeed near the human body (see Figs. 3 and 4), and in turn underpredicts the convective mass transfer rate to the human surface. Fig. 6a, d and e illustrate the influence of turbulence model on the ozone transport. Compared to the RANS models (Fig. 6a and d), LES (Fig. 6e) predicts a larger ozone concentration gradient near the human body. For simulations with the standard k\u2013ε, SST k\u2013ω and LES models, the ozone concentration at the room exhaust is 70, 69 and 59 ppb, respectively. As LES simulates the near-human airflow with a higher airspeed and more flow eddies (see Figs. 3 and 5), it calculates a stronger convection and turbulent diffusion of ozone to the human surface, which leads to a higher ozone mass transfer rate at the surface. Given that LES has a better performance in predicting near-human airflow and turbulence than the RANS models as discussed in Section 3.1, LES likely also provides more accurate calculations of mass transfer rate near the human surface. Several studies [29,57,58] found that the simulated mass transfer rate based on LES agrees better with experiments than the RANS models. More quantitative evaluations of turbulence model performance are conducted by comparing the simulated ozone deposition velocity (i.e., mass transfer coefficient) against measurements as follows. Fig. 7 summaries the ozone deposition velocity under two ventilation strategies. In the case of mixing ventilation, a high-momentum supply jet facilitates the air mixing and results in a more uniform ozone distribution in the room (see Fig. S2 in supporting information) than displacement ventilation. Hence, the sampled ozone deposition velocities are more clustered under mixing ventilation (Fig. 7b) than displacement ventilation (Fig. 7a). For both ventilation strategies, the case with a larger near-human grid size tends to yield a lower ozone deposition velocity regardless of the turbulence model. However, the deviations are less than 1 m/h from results with human surface grid size y+ = 10 (Grid 2) to those with y+ = 1 (Grid 1), indicating the effect of the near-human grid size is relatively moderate as far as the y+ < 10. Two RANS models (standard k\u2013ε and SST k\u2013ω) predict fairly close ozone deposition velocities with differences within 0.67 m/h, whereas LES calculates a notably larger deposition velocity. With human surface grid size y+ = 1, LES predicts an ozone deposition velocity as 10.57 m/h under displacement ventilation and 11.73 m/h under mixing ventilation, and the SST k\u2013ω model yields 7.65 and 8.19 m/h, respectively. Table 2 summarizes the measured ozone deposition velocities that range from 9 to 22.3 m/h on human surfaces in indoor environments. The RANS models provide lower ozone deposition velocities than the measurements and the LES results exhibit a better agreement. Besides the simulation accuracy, the computational demand is another criterion for the model performance. Table S1 (in supporting information) compares the computing time of simulation cases with various turbulence models and near-human grids. As expected, the computing time is increased with denser grids and refinement of turbulent scales. Table S1 reveals that the case with LES and human surface grid size y+ = 1 (Grid 1) requires roughly three times longer computing time than the case with SST k-ω model and y+ = 10 (Grid 2), and also requires fourteen times longer than the case with SST k-ω model and y+ = 20 (Grid 3). Table 3 provides a summary of ozone deposition velocity and human breathing zone ozone concentration for all simulation cases. It is important to note that under mixing ventilation at a relatively high air change rate (5 h−1), the airflow distribution is nearly uniform (see Fig. S2) and the RANS models can simulate a comparable ozone deposition velocity with LES (differences<9%) for the same grid size. With human surface cell size y+ = 1, the standard k\u2013ε, SST k\u2013ω and LES models predict the deposition velocity as 9.54, 10.2 and 9.42 m/h, respectively. A previous study [62] measured the ozone deposition velocity as 9 m/h under a similar ventilation condition (mixing ventilation at an air change rate of 5 h−1). For this case, both the LES and RANS models can yield a satisfactory agreement with the experiments. This result suggests that the RANS models tend to perform better in predicting mass transfer in more well-mixed airflow fields. Our results also reveal that the breathing zone ozone concentration increases with a larger near-human grid size. However, the deviations between the cases with human surface cell size y+ = 1 and 10 are only within 7 ppb (10%), implying the influence of grid size on the prediction of human ozone exposure is modest when y+ < 10. Our results suggest that the LES model with fine near-human grid size (e.g., y+ = 1) can provide reasonable results of airflow and mass transfer in the near-human microenvironment, although it is computationally more demanding than SST k\u2013ω or standard k\u2013ε models. The SST k\u2013ω model performs well for the near-human airspeed simulation, whereas it may underpredict the turbulent energy of thermal plume and the mass transfer rate near the human for a large near-human grid size. The study results reveal that a near-human gird size y+ >10 can yield unreasonable estimations of airspeed and mass transfer rate at human surface. 4 Conclusions This study evaluates the accuracy of CFD models for airflow and mass transfer in the near-human microenvironment due to the turbulence model and near-human grids. Under a range of ventilation conditions, we tested three near-human grid sizes with average human surface y+ of 1, 10 and 20 as well as three turbulence models: standard k\u2013ε, SST k\u2013ω, and LES models. The following main findings are obtained. 1) With adequately fine near-human grid size (e.g., y+ = 1), the SST k\u2013ω and LES models can perform well in predicting the airflow field near the human body. However, the standard k\u2013ε model underestimates the intensity of thermal plume and the airspeed above the head than the experimental data. 2) The coarser near-human grids lead to prediction of lower airspeeds near the body. The simulated airspeed above the head with human surface cell size y+>10 yields significant deviations (>25%) from the measurements. 3) RANS models cannot capture the detailed turbulent structure of thermal plume and yield a notably lower turbulence kinetic energy near the human than LES. The maximum kinetic energy above the head based on the SST k\u2013ω model can be 56% smaller than that of LES. 4) For the prediction of ozone mass transfer rate at the human surface, LES can simulate the ozone deposition velocity within the range reported from other experimental studies. Standard k\u2013ε and SST k\u2013ω models predict about 30% lower ozone deposition velocities than the LES results at an air change rate of 0.5 h−1. However, the RANS models can provide more comparable results with LES (with differences < 9%) under a more well-mixed airflow (e.g., mixing ventilation at an air change rate of 5 h−1) compared to buoyancy-driven flow regime, 5) A larger near-human grid size leads to prediction of a lower ozone mass transfer rate at the human surface and a higher human ozone exposure. However, this effect is modest as far as the human surface grid size y+<10. These study results will be useful for CFD modelers to assure the quality of simulation results and improve decision-making of what turbulence model and near-human grid size should be used for the simulations of reactive gases near the human surface.

        "dc:description": "Indoor chemical reactions with human surfaces can meaningfully affect indoor pollutant dynamics and human exposure to reactants and products. Computational Fluid Dynamics models have been used to simulate ozone-human surface reactions in indoor environments. However, the model uncertainties due to near-human grid size and turbulence model are not well understood. The objective of this study is to assess performance of turbulence models and near-human surface grids in predicting local airflow and ozone transport near the human surface under a representative range of indoor airflow conditions. The results show that Large Eddy Simulation (LES) with a fine near-human grid size (e.g., y+ = 1) can yield reasonable results of airflow and mass transfer near the body. The SST k\u2013ω model performs well for the simulation of near-human airspeed, whereas the standard k\u2013ε model can predict lower airspeeds above the human head than the measurements. Both standard k\u2013ε and SST k\u2013ω models may underestimate the turbulent kinetic energy of the thermal plume and ozone deposition velocity at the human surface. The results also suggest that near-human grid sizes of y+ >10 can lead to unreasonable estimates of airflow and mass transfer rate near the human surface.",
