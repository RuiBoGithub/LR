Building energy systems with circulation loops have high circulation heat loss, resulting in low energy utilization efficiency. It requires energy-saving operation strategies to eliminate unnecessary circulation heat loss, especially in domestic hot water (DHW) systems. The objective of this paper is to improve the energy efficiency of building energy systems and reduce operational costs. This is done by dynamically adjusting the target temperature set point. This is the first study to present a computationally inexpensive method for accurately predicting the temperature drop of hot water in environments with changing ambient temperatures. The outcome indicates that energy usage efficiency could be increased by approximately 16.42 %, while operational costs could be lowered by approximately 24.76 % for over 90 days in the fall. The proposed model is an implementable approach for predicting temperature drop and optimal operational scheduling as part of robust and reliable building energy management in real-world scenarios.

Domestic hot water (DHW) system design and configuration having high thermal energy consumption and low energy efficiency during operation is one of the most energy-intensive systems in the construction industry. Domestic hot water consumption contributes 19 % of the total thermal energy demand in the building sector [3], whereas space heating (SH) in 2018 accounts for 50 % [4]. Energy use for space heating is decreasing as new energy-efficient buildings become available. The energy demand to produce domestic hot water (DHW) has remained relatively constant, resulting in a further increase in the share of domestic hot water in total energy consumption [5]. This share may rise from 25 % to more than 50 % [6]. In some specific periods, this share rises from 25 % to 93 % [7]. For ensuring a 10-second waiting period [5], the circulation loop of the DHW system increases thewaste of thermal energy [8]. Thomas investigated centralized DHW systems with circulation loops for circulation heat loss and discovered that design engineers lack an assessment of actual DHW demand since the actual hot water consumption did not meet the design value. The demand for hot water was a small fraction of its projected design capacity [9], resulting in most of the generated thermal energy being wasted to circulation heat loss. Up to 73 % of energy is lost in a centralized DHW system with a circulation loop [10]. The primary cause of these structures' low energy utilization efficiency is the low DHW consumption ratio. It is necessary to improve the ratio of DHW consumption by using an optimized operation scheme. Numerous researchers made efforts to enhance the energy efficiency of buildings. Building energy saving is roughly classified into passive and active building energy-saving (BES) technologies [11]. Passive BES technology has some limitations. Existing buildings cannot be retrofitted to make their DHW systems more efficient unless the whole structure is refurbished or the pipe is replaced [12]. The alternative direction is active BES technology, which includes the improvement of the control system or strategy. Considerable study has been devoted to the enhancement of the control system or strategies, including genetic algorithms (GA) [13], simulated annealing [14], fuzzy logic [15], dynamic programming [16], and Lagrangian relaxation [17]. In addition, the non-dominated sorting genetic approach II (NSGA-II) and the model predictive control (MPC) are commonly employed in constructing performance optimization [18]. According to Deb et al., NSGA-II is a widely used algorithm for building performance optimization and building facilities since it employs an efficient non-dominated ranking mechanism and an elite strategy that generates well-distributed Pareto solutions [192021]. Ferreira et al. [22] simulated and optimized solar dish-Stirling engine systems for residential buildings using the National System for Optimal Design (NSGA-II) technique, and Kazmi [23] used model-based active control to regulate the optimized hot water consumption profile to achieve energy savings. According to the findings, DHW may reduce energy use by 20 % by incorporating data into the optimization process. Similarly, the MPC applied to the DHW system offers immense potential [24]. Diaz devised a predictive-like controller to reduce total operating costs of CHP, where the energy market limits were incorporated in the optimization problem [25]. Finck optimizes the charging and discharging of thermal energy storage (TES) tanks using MPC and day-ahead rates, hence providing flexibility in the short term [26]. The author [27] implemented economic MPC (EMPC) on a residential structure with a heat pump (HP) and structural storage. Experiments suggest that performance can be enhanced by correlating operational electricity costs with demand flexibility performance metrics. In addition, the author designed an EMPC method to reduce the total operating expenses associated with managing the HP power consumption of buildings. To calculate the fractional prediction error for EMPC models that do not account for dynamic heat losses, a compensating method was created. The data indicate that 9 % of the energy utilized was saved. Shen [28] conceived of an electric water heaters (EWH) intelligent scheduling and control system utilizing data-driven perturbation forecasting in robust MPC (RMPC). In order to reduce fuel costs by up to 33.2 % while keeping the required DHW temperature, the demand for domestic hot water was estimated using uncertainty intervals that covered up to 97 % of the actual demand during the test period. A review of the literature showed that although active BES technology has been significant contributions to improving the energy efficiency of buildings, less emphasis has been paid to how heat loss affects the performance of modern buildings. The issue appears to have been neglected in earlier studies [12]. However, there are two reasons for ignoring circulating heat losses: (1) Traditional heat loss calculation methods employing computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models are often impractical in practice, as each new building plan and vessel necessitates a new CFD model or recalibration of current model [23]. This limits the application of CFD models. (2) Obtaining parameters, such as pipe layout, pipe size/position, pipe insulation level, etc., is difficult in practice. The two disadvantages mentioned above result in limited scalability in realistic environments. Therefore, scholars usually used empirical methods for heat loss calculations (e.g., some average value of heat use or percentage of total heat use) to avoid these two difficulties. However, it was shown that circulation heat loss at actual ambient temperatures varied significantly. Failure to account for dynamic heat loss results in discrepancies between simulation results and reality, negatively affecting models' performance. Active BES technologies that disregard dynamic heat loss are deficient. Unrefined physical understanding entails a substantial discrepancy between the catalog performance of such systems under the rated condition and their actual operational performance, particularly in systems needing the determination of temperature setpoints. Consequently, there is a gap in the optimal operation of building energy systems' technological advancement. The novelty of this paper is twofold. On the one hand, this paper proposes a computationally inexpensive approach for predicting water temperature. The proposed approach can fill the research gap (the poor applicability and the difficulty in obtaining data acquisition in the CFD model), eventually pushing the related technologies beyond the state of the art. The developed water temperature prediction model, which is applicable to DHW systems with recirculation loops in the existing buildings, answers the need for general formulations of the phenomenon and overcomes the limitations of empirical approaches or the CFD model. On the other hand, this paper also proposes a dynamic heat loss-based operational scheduling (DHL-based OS), which is realized by adjusting the hot water target temperature set-point. The heat losses have been ignored in other studies. The objective of this paper is to reduce operating costs by meeting the same hot water demand in a way that increases energy utilization efficiency. The main contributions of this paper are as follows: ∙ It is confirmed that it is not feasible to ignore dynamic heat loss when developing an optimal operation scheme for DHW systems. ∙ The study presented a novel simplified method for computing dynamic heat loss. The proposed method does not require those parameters that are difficult to obtain. It means that the method can be easily extended to other building scenarios that include DHW systems. ∙ To achieve energy savings based on the prediction of the future water supply temperature, the proposed DHL-based OS dynamically adjusts the hot water target temperature set point at different decision stages and considers the time delay before the water reaches a target temperature. For the objectives to be achieved, the article is structured as follows. Section 2 investigates and discusses the circulation heat loss in the DHW system. Section 3 presents the research methodology, with full details of the calculation method of dynamic heat loss, the DHL-based OS, and the optimization procedures. Section 4 presents the simulation results and discussion. Finally, conclusions are drawn. 2 Experiment analysis This section reports the experimental analysis of the DHW system. The main purpose of the investigation is to confirm the necessity of considering dynamic circulation heat loss in DHW systems. First, the test rig, experimental setup, and data acquisition system of the tested DHW system are described. Secondly, the heat loss during the day and the water temperature variation under dynamic heat loss were counted and analyzed. Finally, the statistics and analysis of the local hot water demand provide the basis for the optimal operation of the DHW system. The logical framework of this section is shown in Fig. 1 . 2.1 Description of the DHW system 2.1.1 Test rig The experiment is conducted in a 5500 m2 research office in Yangzhong, China, where hot water is predominantly used for bathing/showering in the dormitories, washing vegetables/cleaning dishes in the kitchen, and washing hands in the public office area. Table 1 summarizes the primary characteristics of the devices assessed for each module. In addition, the experimental installation and equipment are mounted on the roof of the building. Fig. 2 depicts a simplified diagram of the DHW system configuration. An internal combustion engine generator set micro-CHP system is fitted for the Heat Production Module to provide thermal and electrical power (see Fig. 3 a). The temperature sensor detects when the water temperature falls below the set point. It activates the micro-CHP while simultaneously activating the pump. The plate heat exchanger circulates hot water from the top to the bottom of the tank. As a result, domestic hot water is produced quickly as mains water flows through the heat exchanger. Notes that the standard Legionella growing range is from 25 ℃ to 55 ℃. The standard T/CECS462-2017 has clear water supply temperature requirements for the inhibition of Legionella growth i.e., cold water below 25 °C and hot water above 55 °C. For systems with large DHW volumes, high-temperature regimes are required to inhibit Legionella, while temperature requirements for systems without DHW storage or circulation loop are less stringent. To avoid the risk of Legionella, the following measures have been done: 1. The hot water tank located on the supply side of the DHW system participates in the hot water circulation to avoid the static water body creating conditions for its growth, eliminating the risk of Legionella bacteria. 2. The maximum water supply temperature of CHP is 85 °C, which is sufficient to kill Legionella at this temperature. In addition, there is a hot water with 8000 L capacity tank in the circulation loop located on the supply side (see Fig. 3b). The role of the hot water tank is not to store thermal energy but to increase the thermal inertia of the DHW system. 2.1.2 Experimental setup In the experimental test, the DHW circulated in the circulating loop, but no hot water was delivered to the end user; this was done to test the water temperature change caused by circulation heat loss. After receiving the thermal tracking based ON signal of the test, the micro-CHP was activated until the water temperature inside the tank reached an upper temperature (46 ℃). Then, the temperature drop sequence was recorded. 2.1.3 Data acquisition system The Acquisition and Control System includes a thermostat (see Fig. 3c), two ultrasonic flowmeters (see Fig. 3d), and a small weather station (see Fig. 3e) to control and monitor the desired variables so that to obtain accurate information and ensure the proper operation of the installation. Two ultrasonic flowmeters are fitted, one in the cold- and hot-water lines, while the thermostat is positioned at the bottom of the tank. The thermostat is installed at the bottom of the tank. The micro-CHP is activated when the tank temperature falls below a predetermined threshold. For the micro-CHP system, Yanmar company provides a Monitoring System that keeps track of its operation status, such as micro-CHP on/off, operation hours, power, heat recovery, the cumulative flow of natural gas, etc. The designed Printed Circuit Board (PCB), as shown in Fig. 3f, is used to record the operation data from the ultrasonic flowmeters/thermostat/small weather station, such as hot/cold water temperature, the cumulative flow of water, flow rate, ambient temperature, and time stamp, etc. Table 2 displays the calibration test results for each device. 2.2 Data statistics and analysis of the circulation heat loss 2.2.1 Circulation heat loss profile Traditional optimal operation solutions viewed ambient temperature as constant. In this paper, to investigate the feasibility of this assumption, heat loss during a day in a real environment was investigated. Fig. 4 demonstrates that the heat losses in the DHW system are high, confirming previous findings [2930]. In addition, the heat loss throughout the day was investigated. In this experiment, the heat loss for each hour was obtained from a sequence of water temperatures when no hot water was used. The circulation heat loss in Fig. 5 is computed by the following equation: (1) Q loss = c m DHW Δ T where Qloss is the circulation heat loss, c is specific heat capacity, mDHW is the total quality of hot water in the DHW system, ΔT is the measured difference of hot water. Fig. 5 shows that the circulation heat loss per hour is different due to the temperature differences between hot water and ambient temperature. 2.2.2 Temperature drops under the dynamic heat loss To investigate the impact of dynamic heat loss on temperature drop, the temperature drops of hot water at the actual ambient temperature without the use of hot water were recorded, as shown in Fig. 6 . It indicates that the temperature drop is solely attributable to circulation heat loss. For the detailed experiment, the initial water temperature was adjusted to 46 ℃, with a subsequent decline to 40 ℃. In accordance with heat transfer theory, a lower ambient temperature requires less cooling time. In a cold day, the water supply temperature in the DHW system can drop from 46 °C to 40 °C in as little as 7 h. The conclusions are supported by actual data collected by ultrasonic flowmeters. Besides, Fig. 6 demonstrates that the four temperature decline trajectories are distinct. This is because the difference in TD between real ambient temperature and water temperature causes the rate of temperature drop to change. Due to the disparity in the curves, the average temperature cannot be a variable in the heat loss calculation. Consequently, it is irrational to calculate heat loss assuming constant ambient temperature when the development of the optimal operation. The real ambient temperature is variable, which means that the temperature difference is constantly changing so that the temperature drop does not correspond to an exponential or linear decrease. Consideration needs to be given to the dynamic heat loss under real-time ambient temperatures. 2.3 Data statistics and analysis of local DHW demand To develop a reasonable solution, statistics and analysis of local hot water demand were conducted. The hot water use was investigated over two-week. And the correlations between heat production, water consumption, heat loss, and heat loss ratio were studied over three-month. 2.3.1 DHW consumption profile Fig. 7 shows the daily hot water consumption in a week. We can draw the following conclusions. (1) There is no demand for hot water at night thus, it is reasonable to stop heating during this time to prevent large circulation heat loss. (2) During the day, the non-use period also occurs, resulting in more circulation heat loss when maintaining water delivery temperature. 2.3.2 Correlation analysis This subsection shows the correlations between heat production, water consumption, heat loss, and heat loss ratio over three-month (from September to November). Each point in Fig. 8 represents the total value for the day. As illustrated in Fig. 8a, a value of −0.71 between hot water consumption and ambient temperature suggests a negative correlation. As the ambient temperature decreases, the hot water consumption increases; The ambient temperature and heat production also exhibit a negative correlation (Pearson coefficient is −0.91) in Fig. 8b; As indicated in Fig. 8c, a Pearson coefficient of −0.93 demonstrates a statistically significant negative relationship between the heat loss proportion and hot water consumption. It means that it is a recommended choice to decrease the heat loss ratio under the same hot water demand; A Pearson coefficient of 0.70 of the hot water consumption and heat loss percentage exhibit a positive relationship in Fig. 8d. This is consistent with prior research results [23]. To summarize, during peak hours, lower target temperature set points may be an effective method for conserving thermal energy while maintaining the same demand for hot water. During off-peak hours, the thermostat is regulated between 39 and 40 °C, turning off the micro-CHP at night to save running time during low or no DHW use and thereby greatly reducing heat loss. Therefore, it needs to dynamically adjust daily temperature setpoints. Details on determining the temperature setpoint are described in Section 3.4. To reduce the heat loss in the DHW system, the temperature set-point is expected to meet the hot water demand with the lowest water temperature set-point. To determine the reasonable temperature set-point, an accurate prediction of future water temperature is required. Dynamic heat loss needs to be considered for the prediction of future water temperature. Therefore, the formula based on Newton's law of cooling to calculate the dynamic heat loss is proposed. The details of the derivation process are shown in Section 3.1. 3 Proposed methodology for optimal operational scheduling of DHW system The paper proposes a DHL-based OS to dynamically adjusts the target temperature set-point at each target temperature moment. The determination of the target temperature set point is achieved by predicting the future water temperature change of the DHW system. Dynamic heat loss is considered in the forecast of future water temperature. 3.1 Modeling of dynamic heat loss The presented modeling approach described the variation relationship between ambient and hot water temperature, which has never been used to demonstrate theoretical formulations to the authors' knowledge. Below is the mathematical proof. According to the scenario presented in this research, the surface of the liquid is sealed, and the water temperature is not excessive. The circulation heat losses are caused by heat conduction between hot water and ambient air. The entire pipeline can be considered as an object with a higher temperature than the surrounding environment. Therefore, circulatory heat loss can be viewed as the slow transmission of heat to the surrounding medium. The basis of the circulation heat loss calculation is to compute the temperature drop of the DHW system under the changing ambient temperature, and then to apply the thermodynamic formula to obtain the circulation heat loss. The process of derivation is depicted below: Assuming that ∙ The external environment is an approximate thermostatic environment within a minute. ∙ The high-temperature heat equilibrium liquid is placed in a low-temperature environment. ∙ The flow speed is constant. ∙ The total quality of hot water in the circulating pipe is constant. According to Newton's law of cooling Equation (2), the hot water temperature change caused by circulation heat loss is Tloss . The differential equation for Tloss is as follows: (2) d T loss t d t = - τ T loss t - T amb ( t ) where τ is the time constant representing the heat dissipation capacity of the DHW system. Tamb is the ambient temperature. The Equation (2) is subjected to the indefinite integration processing and the logarithmic processing to obtain the Equation (3): (3) T loss t = T amb ( t ) + e C e - τ t where t is time. Let t0 = 0, which indicates that the water temperature at t0 is the known initial temperature Tloss (t0 ). To obtain the eC : (4) e C = T loss ( t 0 ) - T amb ( t 0 ) where eC is constant. It then gets Equation (5) by substituting Equation (4) with into Equation (3) yields: (5) T loss t = T amb t + T loss t 0 - T amb t 0 e - τ t . The temperature profile of each DHW system has a corresponding time constant, which depends on the respective pipeline characteristics such as the pipe layout, pipe diameter, insulation materials, etc. This time constant plays a key role in the thermal dynamic behavior of the building and the possibility of implementing thermal comfort management strategies [33]. For the time constant τ of each DHW system, it is recommended to obtain a sample number of 30 groups (n = 30) of temperature drop series, and calculate the average value of τ by the following equation: (6) τ = ∑ i = 1 n ln T loss t 0 - T amb T loss ( t f - T amb ) t f - t 0 n where the initial water temperature T(t0 ), the final water temperature T(tf ), and the time t from the T(t0 ) to the T(tf ). However, the model time complexity increases when Equation (5) is used to determine the change in water temperature per minute. The time scale is thereby 15 min, and the equation for water temperature, shown in Equation (10), has been simplified. The derivation process of the simplified equation is shown in Equations (7)-(9). To meet the requirement of 15 min time scale, the ambient temperature is set to be an average over a 15-minute period, as follows: (7) T amb ¯ = ∑ t = t 0 t = t f T amb t t f - t 0 . After recursive processing of the temperature difference caused by circulation heat loss from tf to t0 , the following equation is obtained: (8) T loss t f - T loss t 0 = T loss t 0 - T amb ¯ e - τ t - 1 ∑ t = 0 n e - τ t where the n depends on the set time scale. In this paper n is 15 (minutes). Since e - τ t is a geometric series, the sum of the proportional series is as follows: (9) ∑ i = 0 n e - τ t = e - τ ( t f - t 0 ) - 1 e - τ t - 1 . Substituting Equation (9) into Equation (8), the final equation of temperature difference caused by circulation heat loss is obtained: (10) Δ T loss = T loss t f - T loss t 0 = T loss t 0 - T amb ¯ 1 - e - τ t f - t 0 . The contribution of this study is the final formula for determining the change in DHW temperature caused by circulation heat loss, which is Equation (10). Finally, Q loss , the circulatory heat loss is calculated: (11) Q loss t = c m DHW Δ T loss where c is specific heat capacity, and mDHW is the total quality of circulating pipeline. 3.2 Formulation of the simulator in DHL-based OS For the DHL-based OS, micro-CHP is expected to activate during high electricity price periods and deactivate during low power price periods. The micro-CHP creates electrical and thermal energy during periods of high electricity prices. This is because the electricity produced reduces the quantity of electricity imported from the Grid. However, producing heat in advance increases natural gas consumption since it leads to greater circulation heat loss. For the simulator, it is necessary to establish three key parameters: the optimal target temperature moment koptimal , the target temperature set-point Toptimal , and the heating moment kheat . In this study, the simulator calculates the ideal target temperature moment koptimal at 8:00, 12:00, and 21:00 on the next day. The time-sharing electricity price cut-off is utilized to determine the koptimal value. The optimal target temperature setting Toptimal is calculated by predicting the water delivery temperature during the subsequent decision stage. For the heating moment kheat , it is the starting time of heating from the real-time DHW state Thot (k) to target temperature Toptimal . The simulator is constantly re-evaluated throughout the day for the determination of kheat . The essence of DHL-based OS is concerned with determining the control command by predicting the expected state trajectory of system x(t) so that a specified optimality status is achieved. The measured state variable for the DHW is the hot water temperature in the pipeline [33], as shown below: (12) x t = T hot t where x(t) is the real-time hot water temperature in this paper. The general solution of the heat balance of the building can be written in the following form: (13) T hot t = Q heat t - Q usage t - Q loss t c m DHW where heat production Qheat and heat consumption Qusage are as follows: (14) Q heat t ∈ 0 , Q rated (15) Q usage = c m cold T hot t - T cold t In this case, the Qloss can be estimated based on Equation (10) for any hot water pipeline, however the time constant τ is generally given in each building. In addition, the hot water consumption mcold in Equation (14) is determined by the cumulative flow difference of the electromagnetic flowmeter installed in the cold-water pipe. As soon as people used hot water, cold water was added to the DHW system; hence, the amount of hot water consumed equals the amount of cold water added to the system. To meet the required time scale of 15 min, the problem needs to be discretized in time to represent different decision stages and discretized in the state to represent a finite number of decisions to be made at each decision stage. Consequently, the continuous-time differential equations describing the DHW system dynamics are discretized to produce discrete-time difference equations that describe the state transition from one discrete-time instant to the next. Consider the micro-CHP to be controlled by a discrete-time state trajectory as follows: (16) T hot k + 1 = T hot k + ∑ t = 1 t = 15 Q heat t - Q usage t - Q loss t c m DHW where k is the discrete-time step (15 min), k ∈ [0,96]. In addition, the physical constrains on the thermal energy inside the DHW are specified by defining the following set of admissible sets: (17) T hot ( k ) ∈ T min , T max where Tmax and Tmin is temperature upper and lower limits, respectively. The control input constraints are specified by defining the following set of admissible inputs: (18) P ele k ∈ 0 , P rated (19) Q heat k ∈ 0 , Q rated where Prated is rated power of micro-CHP, and Qrated is rated thermal power of micro-CHP. The Heat Production Module is either off or on, which means that the power input Pele and thermal input Qheat delivered by the module are either zero or its rated power Pele and Qheat . 3.3 Control variables The continuous set of admissible inputs U*, delivered by the Control System Module, need to be discretized to create a finite set of input values. Therefore, an input array U* of quantized input vector with values u 1, u 2, u 3 is created. The control variables in the optimal-control problems were the output of micro-CHP Qrated , and the expression is as follows: (20) U ∗ = 1 , u 1 u 2 + u 3 > 0 0 , u 1 u 2 + u 3 = 0 (21) u 1 = 1 , o t h e r 0 , 0 ≤ k ≤ 32 (22) u 2 = 1 , k heat ≤ k optimal 0 , o t h e r (23) u 3 = 1 , T hot < T min 0 , T hot > T max with (24) k heat = k optimal - i (25) i = ⌈ T optimal - T hot k Δ T heat ⌉ (26) k optimal = k optimal , 1 , k optimal , 2 , k optimal , 3 where signal u 1 controls micro-CHP which does not heat up from 0 a.m. to 8 a.m., u 2 is the control signal of heat in advance, u 3 is control signal based on rules, i is the time delay in heat propagation in pipes when the micro-CHP heats the real-time water temperature to the target temperature set-point. This optimizes the start-up advance time of the micro-CHP. The ΔTheat is the increment at each time index and is assumed as constant. The DHL-based OS determines whether to turn on the micro-CHP at any given time. The details of DHL-based OS method are further described in Section 3.4. 3.4 Framework of optimization procedure To drives the thermal output of micro-CHP in a flexible way so that the supply temperature of the DHW system can be dynamically adjusted, the DHL-based OS is proposed in this paper and the data involved are shown in Fig. 9 . The strategy of the DHL-based OS is to (1) not heat at night, (2) maintain a low supply water temperature in the early part of the high electricity period, and (3) heat to the optimal target temperature setpoint in the late part of high electricity period to meet the DHW demand in the flat electricity period. The logic of DHL-based OS is implemented as outlined in Fig. 10 . Notes that the cut-point of the high electricity period and flat electricity period is used as the optimal target temperature moment koptimal , since it is desirable to store heat during high electricity periods in order to reduce the electricity costs for the building. To implement this strategy, the simulator calculates the optimal temperature setpoint Toptimal and determines the appropriate heating time kheat based on the real-time water temperature obtained from the ultrasonic flowmeters, as shown in Fig. 11 . More specifically, the simulator will predict the DHW state trajectories Tsimu (koptimal ), Tsimu (koptimal + 1), \u2026, T simu(koptimal + N), for determining the optimal target water temperature. The DHW state trajectories are calculated by Equation (16). Finally, the simulator calculates the kheat using Equation (24) according to the real-time water temperature Thot (k), and finally outputs the control signal U* to control the start-stop of micro-CHP. The whole algorithms are implemented with MATLAB. The control duration for optimization time steps is 15 min [27]. To make it easier to understand, here is an example. If the optimal target state Toptiaml at 12 a.m. is 43 ℃, and the current water delivery temperature Thot at 10 a.m. is 41 ℃. It takes forty-five minutes to heat from 41 ℃ to 43 ℃ under the ΔTheat of 0.7 ℃ in a time step, the hot water therefore cannot be heated at 10 a.m. However, if the hot water drops to 40.3 ℃ at 11 a.m., and it needs an hour to heat to 43 ℃, which corresponds with the time interval from the current time (11 a.m.) to the optimal target temperature moment (12 a.m.). The practical implementation procedures of the proposed scheme are summarized as follows: Step 1. Determine the moment of target temperature setpoint koptimal based on electricity period. Step 2. Simulate the water temperature based on Equation (16) and determine the optimal temperature setpoint Toptimal . Step 3. Calculate the heating time kheat by the detected real-time water temperature (Equation (24)). Step 4. Control the start-up of micro-CHP based on Equation (20). 4 Simulation results 4.1 Simulator performance of DHL-based OS The simulator provides reliable predictions for DHW consumption patterns with regular hot water consumption. In DHL-based OS, the simulator predicts future water temperature to determine the target temperature set-points. As indicated in Fig. 12 , temperature drops were predicted based on the simulator while temperature rises were extracted from the actual data. Fig. 12 illustrates the prediction error of 21 days, whereas Fig. 13 depicts the temperature drop. MAE = 0.38, MSE = 0.25, MAPE = 0.91 %, and RMSE = 0.50 were used to calculate the accuracy of the forecast. The average inaccuracy of the estimated water temperature is 0.16 °C, which is consistent with what was expected. Fig. 14 and Fig. 15 shows the simulation results of RBC and DHL-based OS. The DHL-based OS and rule-based control (RBC) are compared to determine the impact of dynamically modifying the water distribution temperature on the economics. The range of temperatures is 39\u201345 °C (RBC, Fig. 14a). The RBC was utilized for the micro-CHP and was employed to control the temperature of the hot water tanks. The RBC measured the current DHW tank temperature with an outlet-mounted sensor. Charging was requested from the micro-CHP when the observed hot water tank temperature fell below the lower limit of 39 °C and was terminated at 45 ℃ over the maximum limit. Fig. 14a and 14b show the temperature setpoint and the results of control signal output of RBC. In DHL-based OS, the heating moment kheat depends on the daily temperature set-point. The determination of target temperature set-point considers the dynamic heat loss and hot water consumption. It indicates that the optimal target temperature set-point Toptimal and heating moment kheat vary from day to day, whereas the optimal target temperature moment koptimal is constant. Based on electricity price periods, the koptimal, 1, koptimal, 2, koptimal, 3 is 8:00 or 12:00 or 21:00 respectively in this paper. In RBC and DHL-based OS, the range of water delivery temperature is restricted to a lower threshold to decrease heat loss. As depicted in Fig. 15a, the DHL-based OS has no night-time heating and automatically adjusts the upper threshold. The results of the control outputs are shown in Fig. 15b. The setting of Toptimal is to heat in advance so that it can keep the subsequent hot water demand. The heating moment kheat calculates the appropriate time to ensure that DHW can keep the water temperature of the predetermined optimal temperature Toptimal at koptimal . The simulation of DHW temperature in DHL-based OS model is shown in Fig. 16 . 4.2 DHL-based OS validation 4.2.1 Simulator prediction performance comparison of DHL and non-DHL The predicted value of dynamic heat loss (DHL) and non-DHL were compared to investigate the effect of dynamic heat loss on the accuracy of hot water prediction, shown in Fig. 17 a, while the prediction error of Non-DHL and DHL is shown in Fig. 17c and Fig. 17d respectively. The temperature decay of non-DHL used average ambient temperature, whereas DHL used real-time ambient temperature. The forecast result demonstrates that the non-DHL deviates from the trajectory of the actual water temperature, particularly as the ambient temperature rises. Therefore, dynamic heat loss needs to be used to calculate future water temperatures (DHW trajectory). 4.2.2 Simulator prediction performance comparison of exponential and linear decay Comparing the prediction accuracy of linear DHL [31] and non-linear DHL, as depicted in Fig. 17b, the first half of the anticipated water temperature is close to the actual curve. However, as illustrated in Fig. 17e, the linear decay cannot adequately describe the water temperature drop, even when the DHL is considered. In conclusion, the performance of DHL in terms of fitting and the final prediction value are acceptable. 4.2.3 The influence of DHL-based OS on performance Inaccurate water temperature predictions may have an impact on model performance. Lower temperature set-points are insufficient to fulfill hot water demand, while higher set-points result in excessive heat loss in the DHW system. Table 3 illustrates that inaccurate predictions result in insufficient water delivery temperature. Water temperatures lower than 39 ℃ are deemed insufficient to meet the hot water demand. In addition, as demonstrated in Table 4 , inaccurate water temperature predictions (Linear DHL-based OS) have a negative influence on the model. The Linear DHL-based OS overestimates actual circulation heat losses, allowing the model to acquire a greater temperature set point than the hot water demand. The higher the target temperature setting, the more thermal energy is wasted. 4.3 Evaluation of proposed optimal operational scheduling The simulation results of the different control strategies (RBC and DHL-based OS) calculated key performance indicators (KPIs) for energy utilization efficiency and operational costs [27]. The identical set of conditions applies to all two control strategies, including environment and hot water consumption. The following sections compare two control strategies based on the KPIs. 4.3.1 KPIs \u2013 Energy utilization efficiency The energy consumption for 21 days of three OS for the same hot water demand was simulated, and the heat energy utilization efficiency and energy savings were computed (Table 4). The OS based on DHL (proposed method) has a greater energy utilization efficiency than other OS. The energy utilization effectiveness is 66.44 %, which is 16.42 %higher than RBC. As DHL-based OS can automatically manage the upper limit of hot water temperature, energy is conserved, and heat loss is reduced. 4.3.2 KPIs - operational costs For the control strategies of RBC and DHL-based OS, 90 days in fall gas costs and savings on electricity costs were calculated. The reduction of total operational costs of DHL-based OS is due to the reduction of gas consumption caused by lower supply temperature and the savings on electricity costs, as shown in Table 5 . In DHL-based OS, dynamic electricity price was considered in the determination of heating moment kheat and optimal target temperature Toptimal (Section 3.4). It can be seen from Table 5 that the savings on electricity costs of DHL-based OS is 24.76 % lower than that of RBC, and the gas costs of DHL-based OS is 8.86 % higher than that of RBC. Moreover, the savings on electricity cost in DHL-based OS is even higher than gas cost in this paper. As shown in Table 6 , DHL-based OS has better economic performance due to micro-CHP mainly turned on at high electricity periods. In DHL-based OS, micro-CHP is predominantly activated during the periods of high electricity price. It indicates that the micro-CHP generates electricity mostly during periods of high electricity price, hence reducing the quality of power imported from the grid. 5 Discussion The primary objective of this research is to investigate improvements in the energy utilization efficiency of efficient energy buildings by performing active control for DHW production. The focus is on reducing the natural gas consumed by dynamically adjusting the target temperature set point. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of an energy-efficient operation based on a DHL-based OS model. Although many technical challenges remain, the simulations show that such savings are possible in practice. The experiment confirmed that the circulation heat loss data differed from the average ambient temperature heat loss assumptions. Due to the temperature differences between the delivery temperature and the ambient temperature, circulation heat loss varies per hour (Fig. 5). Failing to account for dynamic heat loss creates a disparity between simulation findings and real-world conditions, which has a negative effect on the performance of models (Table 3). This paper contributes by considering the dynamic heat loss, which other previous studies did not consider. Furthermore, the optimization depends on the occupant's activity and is not unconditional. Buildings' DHW energy consumption is proportional to the amount of hot water they consume and their heat losses. Any increases in energy utilization efficiency are paralleled by a trend in which increased daily water consumption reduces the impact of heat loss on the surrounding environment (Fig. 8). By dynamically altering the temperature set point, this paper enhances the percentage of daily water consumption in total DHW production, lowering heat loss. The energy utilization efficiency is mainly attributable to the fact that micro-CHP was activated at a suitable time as demand response to the grid without compromising user comfort. The effect is seen in Table 5. It is vital to establish the target temperature to satisfy the same hot water demand at the lowest possible delivery temperature to decrease the fraction of circulation heat loss relative to total DHW output. Inaccurate water temperature predictions will affect the determination of the target temperature point and causes the user to lose comfort. The loss of user comfort is one of the most significant concerns associated with the widespread use of intelligent control [23]. Moreover, Inaccurate thermal environment simulation diminishes the effectiveness of the solution of energy-saving operation based on automatic control systems. In this case, inaccurate water temperature predictions have negative effects on the proposed solution, as shown in Table 4. Therefore, it is required to construct the water temperature forecast as a reference. The traditional method is constrained by the difficulties of data collecting and computational complexity, making it unsuitable for the expansion of existing buildings. This paper presents the necessary parameters to be used in the operational data to create the computationally affordable water temperature prediction model. In addition, the relationship between water and ambient temperature was investigated, and mathematical evidence was used to demonstrate theoretical formulations. Compared to previous research [32], the suggested technique can reliably estimate the temperature profile of the water. According to the results, the average error in anticipated water temperature is 0.16 ℃, which is as expected. Setting a lower temperature when switching ON decreases the time the micro-CHP operates and the cost of supplying domestic hot water. When the price of electricity is higher, the water tank primarily engages the micro-CHP to heat the hot water tank to meet the demand for hot water during periods of lower energy rates. Part of the drop in operational expenses is a reduction in electric bills. In addition, when the micro-CHP raises the real-time water temperature to the target temperature, the time delay in heat propagation in pipes is accounted for, and the timetable of the micro-CHP is optimized. For KPIs of energy utilization efficiency and operational expenses, the performance of DHL-based OS and RBC using traditional measures and metrics based on demand flexibility were analyzed. This paper introduced a key performance indicator for energy utilization efficiency to measure the efficient use of thermal energy in domestic hot water [27]. The results indicate that energy flexibility can be optimized by dynamically modifying the set points. 6 Conclusions This research proposes a dynamic operational scheduling model based on heat loss to optimize total operational expenses and energy consumption efficiency. The experiment was conducted in a structure that contained a micro-CHP system and a hot water tank. This experiment indicates that active BES technology needs account for dynamic heat loss. Throughout the testing periods, it was determined that the circulation heat loss varied hourly due to the fluctuating ambient temperature. Based on Newton's law of cooling, equations defining the interaction between water and ambient temperature are created. The process of derivation is detailed in Section 3.1. This research provides the method of dynamically adjusting the target temperature set point to reduce circulation heat loss in the DHW system to improve energy utilization efficiency. The key is to determine the target temperature set point. A computationally affordable method for predicting water temperature is proposed to increase the accuracy of water temperature prediction in determining the target temperature set point. This method takes dynamic heat loss into account. The results indicate that the average inaccuracy of the water temperature prediction is 0.16. With the suggested method, building construction parameters are not required to calculate dynamic heat loss where operating data are used. To reduce operational expenses, the DHL-based OS concept is presented in this study. The local energy cost determines ideal target temperature moment, ensuring that the micro-CHP begins at a cost-effective time. The current study aims to enhance the flexibility of micro-CHP to fulfil thermal energy requirements. Future research will examine expanding the proposed method to the scenario of renewable power generation to meet thermal and electrical energy needs and to include a more advanced electrothermal coupling solution or optimization method that combines micro-CHP units and renewable energy generation.

Appendix A . Rule-based control The RBC was used for the micro-CHP and regulated the water temperature of DHW. The RBC retrieved measurements from one electromagnetic flowmeter located in the outlet of the hot water tank. For RBC, when the measured temperature of the water tank fell below the lower bound of 39 ℃, heating was requested from the micro-CHP. The generated electricity is used to fill the local electricity use. The heating process was stopped at the upper bound temperature of 46 ℃. The default control strategy implemented in the test setup is an example of simple rules-based control, focusing on ensuring user comfort. U = 1 , i f T hot < T min 0 , ifT hot > T max . Appendix B .

        "dc:description": "Building energy systems with circulation loops have high circulation heat loss, resulting in low energy utilization efficiency. It requires energy-saving operation strategies to eliminate unnecessary circulation heat loss, especially in domestic hot water (DHW) systems. The objective of this paper is to improve the energy efficiency of building energy systems and reduce operational costs. This is done by dynamically adjusting the target temperature set point. This is the first study to present a computationally inexpensive method for accurately predicting the temperature drop of hot water in environments with changing ambient temperatures. The outcome indicates that energy usage efficiency could be increased by approximately 16.42 %, while operational costs could be lowered by approximately 24.76 % for over 90 days in the fall. The proposed model is an implementable approach for predicting temperature drop and optimal operational scheduling as part of robust and reliable building energy management in real-world scenarios.",
