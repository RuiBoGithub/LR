This study investigates the applicability of a lumped building modeling approach to model-based predictive control (MPC) to alleviate the complex modeling process of the grey-box multi-zone building model. Based on experimental data, two building models were estimated in this study. The detailed model as a reference case and a lumped model were estimated with decentralized and conventional approaches, respectively. Then, simulations were performed with two boundary conditions, including the comfort bound and electricity cost structure. The performances of the MPC with the detailed and lumped models were analyzed compared to the feedback control. More savings was achieved with a larger comfort bound and more aggressive electricity cost structure. The savings potential of the proposed lumped model approach was not as high as that of the detailed model. However, the proposed method yields good control performance, whose savings was approximately 8.6% over that of feedback control. These results suggest that the proposed method can be used to facilitate MPC implementation in multi-zone building applications.

Heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems account for most of the building energy usage. Traditionally, building engineering has involved efforts to improve the efficiencies of HVAC systems, which is regarded as a saturated field in recent times. On the other hand, management and operation of these systems are considered to have more potential for reducing building energy consumption so as to cope with the threat of global climate change. With the development of the IoT (Internet of things) technology and its integration with environmental factors, including renewable energy and electricity consumers such as electric automobiles, buildings are no longer considered as independent objects but are at the center of smart cities. Therefore, reducing the operating cost of the heating and cooling system in a building is considered as one of the urgent essential tasks. Traditionally, rule-based HVAC control has been investigated extensively [2\u20135]. Given the current and previous data, advanced rules can be found, which are straightforward and easy in terms of implementation in actual systems. However, more advanced control methods have been attempted in recent times based on predictions of the thermal behaviors of the building and its environment. One such example is model-based predictive control (MPC), which yields optimized input trajectories based on the building thermal and HVAC system models along with the weather forecast [6]. The optimization is iterated constantly in each time step, while only the first control input is injected into or overridden in the system. One of the earliest studies on building heating/cooling applications was carried out in the early nineties, with focus on reducing the operational cost and peak demand by utilizing the building thermal mass [7]. One of the largest research projects, known as OptiControl, was carried out in Europe, and insightful discussion and results were found [8]. Recently, general theoretical features, advantages, and insights have been reported in several studies [9,10]. Moreover, several reviews have systematically summarized previous studies and provided future directions based on the perspectives of control engineers [11]. Most recently, extensive reviews have been conducted, and many of the previous works on building applications have been organized and discussed. From theoretical viewpoint to issues in real implementation, implications from various perspectives in different fields have been discussed and summarized [12]. The superior energy and cost savings potential of MPC has been demonstrated with experimental as well as simulation studies targeting commercial buildings. Up to 16% electricity cost savings was reported with a simulation study based on the estimated building model with actual measurements [13]. A single zone in campus research building conditioned with an air-cooled chiller system was tested with multiagent-based MPC. The distributed optimization method was used to minimize HVAC operation and maximize demand charge cost. Further, in a multi-zone case, around 9\u201314% energy savings was achieved compared to conventional feedback control with a simplified MPC that does not require much computation [14]. The building thermal mass was leveraged to utilize pre-cooling with a direct expansion air conditioning system as a HVAC source. When the MPC is applied to a tall multi-purpose building, the electricity cost savings was 36% and 25% for the cooling and heating seasons, respectively [15]. A simplified regression-based building model as well as the thermal energy storage system model were used to evaluate MPC performance in a simulation platform using EnergyPlus. The superior performance of the MPC increased when the thermal inertia of the building structure was leveraged for preconditioning the zone. The radiant floor system is one such example. Significant amounts of energy and cost savings (e.g., up to 34% of cost savings compared to feedback control) were demonstrated not only by simulations but also for actual implementations in a real building [16,17]. Beyond the building, the MPC was applied to the building in a smart grid environment. The battery was utilized for predictive control as a flexibility-resource [18]. For many decades, building energy simulations have been advanced to mainly contribute to development of tools such as EnergyPlus or TRNSYS. Various methodologies to calculate heat transfer through the envelope and integration with a HVAC system have been investigated and validated before addition to simulation engines. Many researchers have also endeavored to develop calibration methods to improve modeling accuracies [19,20]. Therefore, many studies have applied these tools to evaluate the performance of MPC in the simulation environment [21\u201323]. However, these models are heavy for optimizing the control sequence of the HVAC system used in a building zone, which is complex and differs in design. On the other hand, a grey-box model is a simple model that preserves the physical interpretation of the model parameters and structure. Specifically, this model is constructed on the basis of the heat balance equation using the temperature states in building structures (e.g., air and envelope) and resistances between the states. The states have thermal capacity, and the resistances comprise the heat transfer components (i.e., conduction, convection, and radiation). Therefore, it is robust in terms of the prediction performance while being computationally light compared to building energy simulation tools. Moreover, compared to simpler models such as the black-box model (e.g., ARX model), which is known as a parametric model, or machine learning technique [24], the grey-box model is a simulation model that enables prediction of the thermal behaviors of building dynamics for longer prediction horizon (e.g., several hours or even weeks). Several studies have reported the robust prediction performance of the grey-box model, as discussed in a recent review [25]. The great prediction and control performances of the grey-box model was shown via simulations as well as actual implementations [9]. A well-designed experiment and model validation were conducted [26], which was used for actual implementation with a building heating system [27]. In addition to the building envelope models, the grey-box model has been used for HVAC systems in building applications [28]. More recently, machine-learning-based models were used for MPC application in building control. Without knowing and therefore not applying the building scale, structure, and physical interpretation, this model is constructed using data generated from actual buildings or simulation models. Typically, previous historical data are used to predict the one-step-ahead thermal dynamics (e.g., room air temperature or heating/cooling load) along with simple linear or complex structures, such as artificial neural networks. Many studies have relied on building energy simulation tools as the test bed with midware such as the building control virtual test bed [29]. Other studies have focused on only predicting the heating and cooling loads with various learning approaches [30,31]. However, machine-learning approaches are not considered as accurate as the grey-box model for predicting indoor air temperatures. The autoregressive moving-average model (ARMAX), one of the parametric models, is considered better for predicting the thermal behaviors of the building envelope only if the knowledge of the building physics has been applied [32]. In this sense, the machine-learning methods were limited for use as ancillary tools to improve the prediction of the grey-box model; for example, the grey-box model predicts the lumped room air temperature of two stories residential building, with machine learning to predict the separate air temperature of each floor [33]. Additionally, the grey-box model was used as a simulation test platform for evaluating the control performance of the machine-learning-based predictor [34]. However, one of the significant issues of using the machine-learning method for predictive control is finding the optimal control sequence. One approach is to set predefined setpoint trajectory candidates and comparing the control performances [35]. On the other hand, these results depend heavily on how the potential trajectories are set without knowing the actual solution. Estimating the model parameters with an appropriate structure of the grey-box model is challenging owing to the nonlinear nature between the model parameters and output trajectory in the optimization problem. It is known that a large portion of the engineering cost (i.e., 70%) is consumed in a modeling phase in an MPC project [36]. Large gaps of the control performances are thus inevitable depending on the prediction performance of the building model [37]. To overcome the issue of estimating the grey-box building model, a decentralized approach was investigated. In a commercial multi-zone building with air handling units (AHUs), entire zones were separated into several small-scale zones depending on the degree of thermal coupling between the zones [14]. The radiant floor system in a single zone with a double-skin façade was modeled based on the multiagent approach with the distributed optimization method (specifically dual decomposition) [38]. This approach was not a perfect solution as nonlinear optimization was involved but was successful for finding a good model that could be later used for real implementations [17]. Assuming that the thermal zones are controlled with the setpoint tightly, the savings potential of the MPC is maximized when we shift the load from on-peak to off-peak, which has higher efficiency and lower utility cost. Demand charges could also be relieved by moving the load. All zones in a building or even multiple buildings can be optimally conditioned simultaneously by this principle, and the optimal setpoint trajectory of each room or building will show a consistant trend or pattern. Thus, applying global setpoint trajectories for all zones or buildings can provide near-optimal control performances compared to global optimality with different trajectories. A lumped building model can thus be a straightforward solution to apply this approach to MPC implementation. The challenges and complexity of the building estimation process are also relieved with this method. Specifically, without estimating the individual thermal zones one-by-one considering the detailed inter-zone heat transfer, this method can reduce the engineering cost significantly. Moreover, this simple structure can be generalized to other buildings with different scales and designs. The primary objective of this study is to investigate the applicability of MPC with the lumped building model. The grey-box model was used as it is more robust than the machine learning approach in terms of stability and the prediction horizon. Assuming a global room setpoint deployment for the multi-zone building, a lumped model was built to reduce engineering cost while preserving the prediction performance compared to the detailed multi-zone model. The control performances of these two models were analyzed to evaluate the applicability of the lumped modeling approach to MPC. The methodology was first discussed in section 2. Then, the detailed multi-zone grey-box model was estimated as a reference model based on the decentralized approach using experimental data from a real building (Section 3.1). The lumped building model was then estimated with the same data using the volume-averaged room air temperature (Section 3.2). Finally, simulation case studies were performed to investigate MPC performance with the lumped building model compared to that with the detailed one (Section 4). The savings potential of this method was analyzed with boundary conditions, such as comfort, electricity cost, and weather. The applicability and feasibility were discussed with the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed method in conclusions and discussion sections (Sections 5 & 6). 2 Methodology 2.1 Research overview Fig. 1 shows the research schematic, including the modeling and control phases. To evaluate the applicability and feasibility of the lumped building model for MPC, two different building models were estimated separately. The detailed multi-zone building model was estimated with a decentralized approach in a primal decomposition fashion. The lumped building model was estimated based on the simplified model structure with a conventional centralized approach as if the building was a single zone. Then, MPC simulations were carried out with the detailed and lumped building models. The optimal room air temperature setpoint trajectories from the lumped model were input to the detailed multi-zone model to evaluate the control performance fairly. Finally, the performances of the two MPCs were compared with that of the feedback control simulated with the detailed building model. 2.2 Testbed description The flexible research platform (FRP), which is a two-story lightweight commercial building, in the Oak Ridge National Lab was used as the testbed (Fig. 2 ). The five rooms (thermal zones) in each floor were conditioned by the 44 kW rooftop unit (RTU) with air handling unit (AHU) and multiple variable air volumes (VAVs) in each zone. This is a representative commercial building in the US in terms of the plan (13.4 m by 13.4 m) and HVAC systems used. This testbed was unoccupied, and the internal heat gain was emulated with heaters and humidifiers in each room that were controlled remotely. The global horizontal solar radiation and outdoor air temperature were measured through the weather station located on the roof, which were used as inputs to the building models. The cylinder-type temperature sensors measured the room air temperatures at the center of the room and supply air temperatures of the VAV boxes at the end of the supply diffuser. The flow meters, which are not typically installed, measured the airflow rate of the supply air in all VAV boxes to calculate the cooling/heating rates injected to individual zones. The internal heat gain source such as heaters, humidifiers, lighting, and equipment were monitored with the power meter. 2.3 Experimental design for modeling In normal HVAC operation, the disturbance and control inputs are correlated with each other; when the outdoor air temperature is high, the cooling rate injected to the zone is high as well. When the experimental data from these operations are used, large numbers of feasible sets of the estimated building parameters may be generated, which means that the system is undetermined. Therefore, it might be unclear whether the final room air temperature was influenced by the disturbance or control input. In this sense, experiments were carried out with perturbations of the control input by turning on and off the AHU every 3 h. All heaters, humidifiers, and lighting were operated on a typical office schedule and were monitored. The interior doors between the core and perimeter zones were fully closed. The experiments were conducted for 13 days from Sep 20 to Oct 2, 2019. The building was being conditioned in a typical operation schedule before the test. Data from two days, namely Sep 20 and 21, were used for the estimations, and four days of data, including the estimation set and another two days after the estimation set, were used for the validation (i.e., Sep 20\u201323). 2.4 Building model and modeling methods In this study, a grey-box model was used with a state space formulation (Eqs. (1) and (2)). This model is known as the R.C. circuit that consists of resister and capacitor. The latter is thermal capacitance in a temperature state and the prior is thermal resistance between the state and boundary temperature such as outdoor air temperature. The heat balance equation was built in each temperature state and merged into the state (A) and input (B) matrices. Then the continuous-time state-space linear equation was discretized with time-step, which is 15 min in this study. (1) x ˙ = A x + B u (2) y = C x + D u The optimization formulation is shown in equation (3). Y ˆ and Y represent the simulated and measured room air temperatures, respectively. The i and n are the time and number of the data used in the modeling. The building parameter set are denoted as θ that consists of multiple R, C, and α. The first two ones were explained previously and the last one is the coefficient multiplied to the heat flux input such as the solar radiation or internal heat gain. The decision variables and the objective function are nonlinear relation each other so non-linear optimizer (e.g., Fmincon in Matlab) was used. (3) θ * = a r g m i n θ ∑ i = 1 n ( Y ˆ ( θ ) i − Y i ) 2 n − 1 A decentralized approach was used for the detailed multi-zone model which was used as a reference case. Fig. 3 represents the generic example of this approach [39]. This is two multi-zone that consists of one state and outdoor air as a boundary temperature. In decentralized approach, the model complexity is reduced from 2C4R to 1C2R and corresponding number of estimate parameters were 8 to 4. Proposed lumped building model was estimated with conventional centralized approach which is simple and straightforward to implement. The room air temperatures from each zone were volume-weighted averaged. The prediction performance was proved in a previous study. 2.5 Evaluation method The root mean square error (RMSE) was used to quantify the prediction performance of the estimated building model (refer to objective function in Eq. (3)). To evaluate the control performance of the detailed and lumped MPC, feedback control case was used as a reference case. The time-step of the estimated building model was 15 min and actual feedback control of the commercial building has higher resolution with VAV modulation to satisfy the room air temperature setpoint. Thereby the feedback control was mimicked by the optimization (specifically the linear programming) assuming the perfectly tuned feedback control to evaluate the MPC performance conservatively for the fair comparison. As for the control performance, simple relative saving between the MPC and feedback control was used. The cooling cost which is the objective function of the MPC was compared while providing the cooling energy consumption as a reference. 2.6 Boundary conditions The averaged electricity cost of 12.7cents/kWh were used [40] likewise the previous studies [41] which is close to the most recent survey [42]. The time of use (TOU) was used for the electricity cost. Two TOU structure were considered; on-peak is two or three times higher than off-peak (TOU 2 & TOU 3, respectively). The on-peak schedule was from noon to 6 p.m. otherwise the off-peak was applied. The comfort bound of the room air temperature was set with three different levels. The upper comfort bound was fixed at 24 °C while lower bound was set to 20, 21, and 22 °C, respectively. The first set was favorable to maximize the pre-cooling and vice versa for the last one. The initial state temperatures for the room air and envelope were set to the mid value of comfort bound (22.5 °C). The optimization ran for each day with prediction horizon of 24 h. The same initial state temperatures were set for each day. In other words, the daily MPC simulation ran with the same initial temperature. This is to provide the fair comparison in daily saving performance depending on the boundary conditions such as the comfort, TOU structure, and weather. The lighting heat gain was input based on the actual measurement from the testbed ranging 30\u201377 W for each room. The occupancy was assumed one person per room including people (65 W) and equipment (150 W) heat gain. The typical office schedule was used from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. The weather profile including the outdoor air temperature and solar radiation from actual measurement in 2019 was used for the simulation. The Summer data from June to Aug was applied. 3 Control oriented building modeling This section discusses the two different building model: detailed and lumped building models. The prior is reference model that is more realistic as a multi-zone building. The latter is proposed model that is more simplified and lumped. As expected, estimating the detailed model is more challenging that those for the simplified one. This study utilized the decentralized approach to ease dealing with the shared/coupled thermal resistance between the core and perimeter zones. The latter is proposed model which is simpler and more approximated but straightforward. 3.1 Detailed building model Fig. 4 shows the thermal network of the multi-zone building model (2nd floor). Each floor has the same plan except the slightly different size of the core and northern zone. To provide a clear model structure, heat flux inputs including the control and disturbance inputs were skipped, and only the symbol for one zone (upper left) were described. This model consists of 20 capacities, 36 resistances and 17 coefficients multiplied to the disturbance input (e.g., internal heat gain and solar heat gain). Each room has two temperature states (T room and T env ) with capacities for the room (Cp room ) and envelope (Cp env ), and coefficient (α env and α room ) multiplied with the solar heat gain (Q sol ). The inter-zone heat transfer between the floors was ignored. Further, the heat transfer between the perimeter zones were assumed to be adiabatic, where no airflow components such as doors and windows were installed. However, the heat transfer between the core and perimeter zones were considered as there were closed doors that were not sealed tightly, thus allowing airflow underneath the doors. Their resistances were called as shared parameter (blue font in Fig. 4) and estimated in a decentralized fashion The internal heat gain (Q int ) from the heaters and humidifiers was not estimated but assumed that the 40% goes to the envelope and the rest goes to the room air (β). The lighting heat gain (Q lgt ) was distributed at 60% and 40% to the envelope and room air (γ). The initial values for the optimization were set based on the drawing and scientific assumptions, e.g., room air capacity was calculated with the volume and specific heat of the air, and the room capacity was upper bounded only as the room capacity might include the furniture and some portion of the building structure. The initial resistance between states were calculated based on the heat transfer coefficients adopted from the simulation tools such as EnergyPlus or TRNSYS. The lower and upper bounds of each parameter were set with power of ±102 (i.e., θ 0 × 10−2 < θ < θ 0 × 102). The coefficient α was bounded from 0 to 1. The fmincon was used in Matlab environment as a nonlinear optimizer [43]. Prior to the decentralized approach, conventional centralized optimization was carried out. As expected, RMSE of each zone was high which was ranging from 0.9 °C to 4.3 °C [39]. This is because the non-linear optimizer tries to reduce the averaged prediction error of all zones and prediction performance depends on how much the room air temperature was fluctuated in each thermal zone. Specifically, final optimized results would be only good for the zone that would have potential error compared to others. The prediction trend mostly follows the measurement (not seen in this study though), however this model was not reliable to be further used. Rather than estimating all parameters simultaneously, decentralized approach scales down the optimization problem from multi-objective problem to small scaled single-objective problem. The number of estimate parameters was 7 including two capacitances, three resistances, and two coefficients multiplied to the solar radiation. As explained previously (Section 2.4), multiple optimizations (specifically ten) were solved while taking the room air temperature trajectories from neighboring zones. Two days of experimental data were used for the estimation (Sep 20\u201321). Then different value of the thermal resistance between the core and perimeter zones were found from each optimization. The value of those shared parameters is supposed to be the same not to violate the thermal balance. This value can vary in case that the one-way airflow occurs, but we assumed the bidirectional airflow through the gap of the door. Then parametric optimizations were carried out in primal decomposition manner with estimation set. In particular, the individual optimizations of ten single zones ran while fixing the shared thermal resistance between the core and perimeter zones. This was iterated by changing the shared resistance from the minimum to maximum value of the previously estimated shared parameters from ten zone. The final model performance depends on the granularity of this parameter. We discretize the value with 200 steps. The modeling performance of the final model was evaluated with the RMSE of integrated model form likewise the thermal network in Fig. 4 with two additional days as a validation set (four days in total). Fig. 5 shows the evolution of the RMSE in four days validation with changing shared thermal resistance. The averaged RMSE of ten zones were shown along with maximum and minimum value. As the shared resistance becomes large, the performance of the entire model was improved, and this is saturated at some point. The 30th value was selected as an optimal value based on the averaged value. As expected, the RMSE of validation set was higher than that of the estimation as shown in Fig. 6 . The RMSE of all zones were less than 0.82 °C. The average and minimum values were 0.59 °C and 0.46 °C. Fig. 7 shows the room air trajectories of the detailed model and experiment along with disturbance and control inputs. To be concise, only the worst (room 205) and best (room 206) cases were shown. As one can see, even in the worst case, the trajectory of the simulation follows the test value well. This is due to the experimental design that perturbs the room air temperature every 3 h (turn On and Off in turn) while providing the emulated internal heat gain with portable heater. Also, the window blind was not considered so not operated as if they were not installed. For this reason, the room air temperature increases higher than 35 °C during daytime with no cooling provided. And this high fluctuation of the room air temperature caused the higher RMSE. Fig. 8 shows the parameter ranges of final integrated model. As one can see, all parameter value in ten zones were not deviated much each other. Also, estimated parameter such as the capacity of the room and envelope (Cp room and Cp env ) was physically reasonable, e.g., larger room has higher capacity. This proves the validity of the model as well as the prominent prediction performance. 3.2 Simplified lumped building model In a simplified building modeling, the model was lumped into two state model (Fig. 9 ) as explained in methodology (section 2.4). The room air temperature was volume-weighted averaged. All control and disturbance input were the same and appropriately summed. Fig. 10 shows the room air trajectories of the lumped model and experiment along with disturbance and control inputs. The RMSEs of estimation and validation were 0.35 °C and 0.60 °C, respectively. Please note that the results were different compared to the previous study [39] as this study used different data set. And the RMSE of lumped model was similar with those of the detailed model; the averaged RMSEs of ten zones in the detailed model were 0.42 °C and 0.59 °C for the estimation and validation sets, respectively. The estimated parameter value of the lumped model is also physically reasonable compared to the detailed model. To be specific, the capacity and resistance are approximately ten times higher than those in each zone model (refer to Table 1 in Appendix). Please note that the capacity was summed in series while the resistances were summed according to the parallel rule. 4 Simulation case study This section discussed the MPC simulation with detailed and lumped building models. The cooling cost saving potential of those were compared with typical feedback control. The testbed building was conditioned likewise a typical commercial building that maintains the room air temperature by VAV modulation with proportional\u2013integral\u2013derivative (PID) gain. Simulating the feedback control with current estimated building model was however not realistic due to the large time-step (15 min). Therefore, the feedback control was mimicked with the optimization. The linear programming was set likewise the MPC except the HVAC efficiency and electricity cost in objective function (refer to section 4.2). This allows the ideal feedback control that maintains the room air temperature at the upper comfort bound which is assumed as the setpoint temperature. In the end, the saving potential of the MPC is calculated in conservative manner. 4.1 HVAC system The energy efficiency ratio (EER) of the RTU was predicted with the outdoor air temperature. Fig. 11 shows the EER prediction with outdoor air temperature [41]. Only the steady state data were used with full load condition. Two stage data were plotted simultaneously but mostly stage 1 data was dominated; The number of stage 1 and 2 data were 39,292 and 1359. Mostly linear relation was found except some low performance region in stage 1. However only 1.3% of the data were in this region. As expected, the efficiency of the RTU increased when the outdoor air temperature was low which is favorable boundary condition for utilizing the pre-cooling. 4.2 MPC formulation The continuous state space formulation was discretized with time-step as shown in Equations (4) and (5). Please note that the control and disturbance inputs were separated. Then, they were iterated so that the compact linear form of the input and output was set as shown in Equation (6). This is a typical formulation that can be easily used for the optimization solver which is frequently used in many previous studies.

The cooling rate (Q AHU ) injected to each zone is a decision variable that is multiplied by the EER and electricity cost (ε cost ) based on the predicted EER and TOU structure. Please note that the bold font represents the vectors. The decision variable in a vector form (bold font) is a single vector including the cooling rate in a prediction horizon from the zone 1 to 10. The comfort bound was set in inequality constraints with a compact form of Equation (6). The input bound was set based on actual constraint in the testbed such as maximum airflow rate of the VAV in each room. Those formulations were implemented in a linear programming syntax (linprog) of the Matlab.

However, the dimension of the decision variable is reduced to 1/10. The outcome of the MPC with a lumped model are control input (cooling rate trajectory) and room air temperature. The latter was input to the detailed model as if this is a global setpoint temperature for all rooms. In each time-step, the cooling rate of all zones were calculated only if the room air temperature was higher than the global setpoint temperature not to provide the heating. 4.3 Simulation results Three comfort bounds and two TOU structures were considered in this study, as explained in methodology (section 2.6). The daily cooling cost saving percentage of the MPC for Summer season (June\u2013August) compared to the feedback control was analyzed. Fig. 12 shows the example (June 7) of control performances of the MPC and feedback controls. Three cases were compared including the room air temperature trajectories and cooling rate. Please note that the ten trajectories with color were confusing thus plotted grey. As one can see, the feedback control maintained the room air temperature at the upper bound which is ideal. Please note that we have set the upper bound as a setpoint of the feedback control and implemented the optimization (linear programming) likewise the MPC except the efficiency and cost information in the objective function. This is to provide the conservative saving potential of the MPC compared to the feedback control. There is no pre-cooling in the feedback control while the two MPC cases have utilized the pre-cooling by shifting the load from on-peak to the off-peak. Therefore, the lower electricity cost was applied. Also, the higher EER with lower outdoor air temperature was utilized with this pre-cooling. In the proposed lumped MPC (right in Fig. 12), the dotted bold line is the setpoint trajectory from the MPC simulation with lumped building model. This trajectory was input to the detailed model. All room air temperature followed this in the morning and corresponding amount of the pre-cooling to the detailed MPC was realized. However, in the afternoon, the room air temperature was not able to touch the upper bound. This means some zones were over-cooled. However, all zones were touching the upper bound in detailed MPC. This is because that the lumped model used the global setpoint temperature for all zone and the pre-cooling was forced to occur while the detailed MPC maximize the pre-cooling potential for all zones in different extent according to the zone characteristics such as the size and thermal capacity. The resultant energy and cost consumption of one day (June 7) were summarized in a Table 1. In MPC cases, more cooling rate and cooling power were consumed while the cost savings was between 9.2 and 12.4% compared to the feedback control. This reduction is attributed to the load shift from on-peak to off-peak; the portion of the cooling load consumed in the on-peak was 77% for the feedback control, whereas the consumption by the detailed and lumped MPCs were 34% and 43%, respectively. The averaged EER was higher and unit cost ($/kWh) was lower in MPC cases as the cooling rate was provided more in off-peak when the cost was cheaper, and EER was higher. The performance of the lumped MPC was not as good as those of the detailed MPC (12.4% vs. 9.2%) but still yields decent saving potential compared to the feedback control. Fig. 13 shows the averaged daily saving percentage for three months simulations with two boundary conditions including the comfort bound and TOU structure. The more saving of the MPC was achieved with more aggressive TOU. And mostly the larger comfort bound was advantageous to provide more cost saving. The average savings for the three comfort bounds were 1.3% and 7.7% in the lumped MPC while those were 4.3% and 8.9% in the detailed MPC with TOU2 and TOU3 structure, respectively. The discrepancy of the saving between the detailed and lumped MPC were more deviated with lower TOU. Fig. 14 shows the daily EER and unit cost (cent/kWh) of three cases. The maximum, minimum, and averaged value for three months were plotted. The saving potential shown in Fig. 13 can be attributed the higher efficiency (i.e., EER) and lower unit cost in MPC cases. This was even more favorable in lumped MPC than detailed MPC. However, the saving potential of the lumped MPC was not as great as those of detailed MPC. This is because of the overcooling occurred in some zone with lumped approach as discussed for Fig. 12. Fig. 15 shows the daily saving frequency of detailed and lumped MPC with 21\u201324 °C comfort bound and TOU3 structure for three months. The averaged saving percentage were 9.1% and 7.8% in detailed and lumped MPC. respectively. The lower performance of the lumped MPC was attributed to the higher frequency in low saving percentages compared to the detailed MPC. The impact of the weather and resulting cooling load on the cost savings of the two MPCs compared to the feedback control were analyzed. The outdoor air temperature and solar radiation were investigated as they are the major factors contributing to the cooling load and ultimately impacting the cost saving rates of the two MPC cases compared to the feedback control. It was observed that the solar radiation has correlated with the deviations in the percentage of savings in the two MPC cases. The relative deviations of the daily saving percentages of the two MPCs compared to the feedback control are plotted with the daily averaged solar radiation and daily cooling rate consumed in feedback control in Fig. 16 . When it was sunny with higher solar radiation and more required cooling rate, the performance of the lumped MPC was close to those of detailed MPC. The deviation decreased with lower solar radiation in terms of the log scale. This means that the proposed lumped MPC is valid for more severe weather conditions that consume more cooling energy, which is more significant than that during mild days. 5 Conclusions This work proposed the lumped building model approach to the MPC in a commercial multi-zone buildings to alleviate the challenges in modeling and implementation to actual building. To verify the applicability of the approach, detailed multi-zone building model was estimated with decentralized approach. The lumped building model was built with conventional approach. Then the simulations were performed with various boundary conditions to quantify the control performance of the feedback control and MPC. Specific findings from this work were summarized as follows: \u2022 The detailed and lumped building models were estimated with actual measurement and robust prediction performance was found. \u2022 MPC simulations with different comfort and TOU structures were performed. The control performance of the proposed lumped MPC was close to that of detailed MPC in TOU3 (7.7 vs. 8.9%) while deviated in TOU2 (1.3 vs. 4.3%) 6 Discussion The objective function used in this study was for conserving electricity costs. Although the HVAC model was implemented with the objective function, the electrical power consumption was not reduced for the comfort bound of 21\u201324 °C and TOU3. These results are not desirable in a national energy policy perspective. Appropriate modification of the objective function can thus be applied to evaluate the cost performance as well as energy performance for different purposes. This study is only applicable to multi-zone building that can use the global setpoint temperature for all zones with same schedule. If the different indoor environments are required, such as various room setpoints, the cost and energy performance inferred in this study with proposed approach cannot be realized. Depending on how the setpoint temperatures are deviated, the saving potential of the proposed method would be varied. The decentralized approach was only utilized for the reference case, i.e., detailed multi-zone model to evaluate the performance of the lumped model. However, this method can be further investigated or used for other applications such as complex and tall building that has different zone characteristics and scale. Also, this modeling approach can be implemented along with the algorithm for HVAC control as well [17,44].

        "dc:description": "This study investigates the applicability of a lumped building modeling approach to model-based predictive control (MPC) to alleviate the complex modeling process of the grey-box multi-zone building model. Based on experimental data, two building models were estimated in this study. The detailed model as a reference case and a lumped model were estimated with decentralized and conventional approaches, respectively. Then, simulations were performed with two boundary conditions, including the comfort bound and electricity cost structure. The performances of the MPC with the detailed and lumped models were analyzed compared to the feedback control. More savings was achieved with a larger comfort bound and more aggressive electricity cost structure. The savings potential of the proposed lumped model approach was not as high as that of the detailed model. However, the proposed method yields good control performance, whose savings was approximately 8.6% over that of feedback control. These results suggest that the proposed method can be used to facilitate MPC implementation in multi-zone building applications.",
