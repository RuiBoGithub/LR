Table 1 Ventilation strategy Mechanism Limitations/challenges Interactive control (IC) The psychrometric process is shown in Fig. 1A. Outdoor air is processed close to indoor air enthalpy by MAUs with a minimum required outdoor air volume while sub-cooling and reheating processes through supply air-handling units (AHUs) are used to achieve simultaneous temperature and humidity control. Simultaneous cooling and reheating Dedicated outdoor air ventilation (DV) The psychrometric process is shown in Fig. 1B. Temperature and humidity control loops are fully decoupled as the outdoor air volume can be adjusted higher than the minimum required outdoor air volume according to the indoor latent load. High cooling demand for handling outdoor air Partially decoupled control (PD) Outdoor air is processed below the indoor dewpoint with a minimum required outdoor air volume to handle the indoor latent cooling load, which decouples temperature and humidity control loops in partial load conditions (Fig. 1B). This is a suitable substitute for the interactive control strategy. Simultaneous cooling and reheating under high internal latent load (Fig. 1C) Adaptive full-range decoupled ventilation (ADV) Mode switching between DV and PD modes is allowable. The economical outdoor air ventilation mode is flexibly selected by comparing energy performance between DV and PD modes under a given working condition. More complicated control is needed Table 2 Description of the proposed strategy and three reference strategies. Table 2 Strategy Description Reference strategies Original strategy (Strategy 1) o Outdoor air is treated below the indoor air dewpoint with the fixed minimum volume required to maintain the zone positive pressure adopting partially decoupled control (PD).o Supply air volume for each zone is fixed to meet cleanliness requirements under design conditions. Strategy 2 Only outdoor air volume is optimally set adopting adaptive full-range decoupled ventilation (ADV).o Outdoor air volume is set to avoid sub-cooling and reheating as far as beneficial via the best use of the MAU for dehumidification.o Supply air volume for each zone is fixed to meet cleanliness requirements under design conditions. Strategy 3 Only supply air volume is optimally set adopting demand-controlled filtration (DCF).o Outdoor air is treated below the indoor air dewpoint with the fixed minimum volume required to maintain the zone positive pressure.o Supply air volume for each zone is adjusted according to particle concentration and cooling demand with the assumption that the indoor temperature and particle concentration are controlled at their higher limits. Proposed Coordinated demand-controlled ventilation strategy (CDCV) Both outdoor air volume and supply air volume are optimally set.o Outdoor air volume is set to avoid sub-cooling and reheating as far as beneficial via the best use of the MAU for dehumidification.o Supply air volume for each zone is adjusted according to particle concentration and cooling demand with the assumption that the indoor temperature and particle concentration are controlled at their higher limits.

Cleanrooms can be 10\u2013100 times as energy-intensive as typical office buildings. The causes of this are mainly high air change rates and counteraction (i.e. overcooling and reheating) processes in applications. Existing studies have addressed the design and control of outdoor and supply air ventilation systems separately without considering the interaction between them, which causes significant energy waste. This study therefore proposes a coordinated demand-controlled ventilation (CDCV) strategy to achieve energy-efficient operation in multi-zone cleanroom air-conditioning systems, by coordinating operation between outdoor and supply ventilation systems. The Lorenz curve and Gini index are introduced to quantify the demand diversity of multiple zones, and degrees of overcooling and overdrying are used to quantify the mismatch between cooling supply and demand. Cleanrooms in a pharmaceutical factory located in Hong Kong, a humid sub-tropical city, are selected to test and validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. Test results show that the optimization of supply air volume can alleviate the mismatch between cooling supply and demand, as well as affect the optimal outdoor air ventilation mode. The proposed strategy can achieve up to 89.6% of reheating and 63.3% of overall energy savings.

Heating, ventilation and air-conditioning typically accounts for more than 50% of total energy use [2]. This is mostly due to high recirculation rates used to ensure indoor cleanliness [3], and the counteraction process (i.e. overcooling and reheating) used to ensure simultaneous temperature and humidity control [4]. For instance, 20\u2013160 air changes per hour (ACH) are necessary to achieve the required cleanliness classification in cleanrooms, which are much higher than 2\u20135 ACH in normally used spaces. Besides, as cleanrooms control humidity in addition to the conventional control objective of thermal comfort, this raises the difficulty of energy-efficient operation due to highly-coupled cooling and dehumidification processes [5]. In cleanroom air conditioning systems, the maximum energy saving potential was estimated to be up to 80% due to improper system design and control in engineering practice [6]. For example, system retrofitting work in pharmaceutical factory buildings in Hong Kong saved up to 42% of annual energy use by optimizing system control strategies, without any form of hardware modification [7]. This indicates that the energy-saving potential of air-conditioning is very high when strict indoor environmental control is required. However, many problems need to be solved to realize this potential [8,9], due to the complexity of air-conditioning systems and their operation when aiming for achieving strict indoor environmental control. One possibly effective approach is to optimally design and control the ventilation systems. As design guidelines tend not to prescribe specific supply ACH values in cleanliness specifications [10], most cleanrooms use oversized supply air ventilation systems to avoid the risk of potential non-compliance. Generally, the processed air in cleanrooms is circulated through high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters at a very high rate to maintain low particle concentrations [11]. The particle concentrations found in operation can be 10\u2013100 times lower than the maximum allowable concentrations according to the design specifications [12]. Assuming the fulfillment of minimum performance requirements regarding particle concentration, one solution for energy-saving is to adopt the demand-controlled filtration (DCF) strategy [13,14], which controls recirculation air volume based on the real-time particle concentration. Previous studies have shown that the adoption of the DCF strategy can significantly reduce recirculating fan energy use [15,16]. The strategy can be implemented based on the online monitoring of particle counts, or occupancy. A study by Faulkner [11] concluded implementing the DCF strategy based on the direct measurement of particles can reduce the energy consumption of the recirculating fans by 60\u201380%. In addition, Strauss et al. [17] proved that occupancy can be used as a surrogate for particle concentration, as humans are the predominant source of particles in cleanrooms. Implementing the DCF strategy based on occupancy [18] can achieve 70% fan energy savings with negligible effects on environmental cleanliness. For outdoor air ventilation systems in cleanrooms, a minimum outdoor air volume is usually required to maintain a minimum indoor pressure hierarchy. Existing outdoor air ventilation strategies for cleanrooms include interactive control (IC) [19], dedicated outdoor air ventilation (DV) [20,21], partially decoupled control (PD) [7] and adaptive full-range decoupled ventilation (ADV) strategies [22], according to the dehumidification demands of the make-up air-handling units (MAUs). The mechanisms and psychrometric processes of outdoor air ventilation strategies are presented in Table 1 and Fig. 1 respectively. The IC and PD strategies involve energy-wasteful counteraction processes, while the DV strategy requires higher cooling demands for handling outdoor air. The ADV strategy has been proposed by the authors of this paper to overcome the limitations of the other outdoor air ventilation strategies by avoiding unnecessary subcooling and reheating. However, these existing studies relating to ventilation optimization addressed the design and control optimization of outdoor and supply air ventilation systems separately without considering the possible interactions between them. As cleanrooms involve interacting control loops, variations in outdoor or supply air volume may greatly influence optimal ventilation mode, control performance and overall energy efficiency of systems. Another challenge encountered in practice is the mismatch between component cooling supply and zone cooling demand, especially for multi-zone air-conditioning systems. The cooling demands of different zones can have large discrepancies and change at any moment [23]. In fact, the need to satisfy the demands of all zones normally leads to overcooling or overdrying with excessive energy use. For instance, it was reported that energy waste reached up to 8% of its total energy usage due to overcooling in U.S. commercial buildings [24]. Zhou et al. [25] found that the overcooling phenomenon resulting from asynchronous behavior in multiple zones is more serious in constant air volume (CAV) systems than in variable air volume (VAV) systems. The reason is that the supply air volume for each zone can be adjusted according to the corresponding cooling demand of a VAV system, offering a better match between cooling supply and demand. Aynur et al. [26] revealed that the variable refrigerant flow system consumes 27% less energy than the VAV system due to the avoidance of overcooling. While these studies focused on applications aiming solely to maintain thermal comfort (e.g., in offices and commercial buildings), the effects of the asynchronous behavior of both sensible and latent cooling demands on the energy performance of multi-zone cleanroom air-conditioning systems have not been fully investigated yet. For cleanrooms, the air-conditioning systems should simultaneously meet cooling (sensible and latent), indoor pressurization and particle concentration requirements in different critical zones. Subsequently, the overcooling and overdrying phenomena may occur simultaneously, which may cause significant energy waste particularly when an improper ventilation strategy is adopted. To address the above critical challenges, this study therefore proposes a coordinated demand-controlled ventilation (CDCV) strategy by coordinating the operation between outdoor and supply ventilation systems for achieving energy-efficient operation in multi-zone cleanroom air-conditioning systems. The main objective of this study is to confirm that the proposed strategy is able to minimize the overall energy use of cleanroom air-conditioning systems while fulfilling the requirements of indoor environmental control, which can be achieved by reducing unnecessary cold-heat offsets and alleviating the mismatch between cooling supply and demand. Case studies are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ventilation strategy in pharmaceutical cleanrooms in Hong Kong, a humid sub-tropical city. 2 Problems illustration using on-site data 2.1 System configuration and ventilation strategy adopted in a pharmaceutical building On-site data collected from the building management system of a cleanroom air-conditioning system in a pharmaceutical building in Hong Kong is used to illustrate the problems when adopting an existing ventilation strategy. Fig. 2 presents a typical cleanroom air conditioning system configuration in subtropical regions, a blow-through type MAU and a draw-through AHU served for multiple zones. The MAU consists of a cooling coil, an axial fan and filters for conditioning make-up air. The AHU contains a cooling coil, a heater, an axial fan and filters for conditioning the supply air. A chiller plant supplies chilled water to both MAU and AHU cooling coils. The system adopts the partially decoupled control (PD) outdoor air ventilation strategy (constant outdoor air volume = 2 ACH) with a constant supply air volume (i.e., 20 ACH). The outdoor and supply air volume of each zone meet the requirements of indoor pressurization and cleanliness under critical design conditions. The MAU cools and dehumidifies the outdoor air to a relatively low temperature, e.g. below its mechanical dew point. The cooled and dried outdoor air is then mixed with recirculated air in an AHU, before being further cooled by the AHU's cooling coil (and reheated by the AHU's heating coil if additional dehumidification is needed) to reach the supply air temperature set-point. Supply air dampers in cleanrooms are modulated to achieve a proper airflow balance and a pressure differential between the cleanrooms. 2.2 Problems concerned adopting the existing ventilation strategy Due to the constant supply air volume needed to meet both cleanliness requirements and cooling demand, the distribution of indoor temperature and humidity may vary widely under existing ventilation strategies. As the cooling loads are unevenly distributed between zones, indoor spaces are likely to be overcooled and overdried, which may cause significant energy waste. Fig. 3 shows operating data from Nov 28 to Nov 30, 2017 in a pharmaceutical cleanroom air-conditioning subsystem in Hong Kong. The air-conditioning subsystem has the same configuration as shown in Fig. 2. The higher limits of indoor temperature and relative humidity were set to 24 °C and 65%, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3A, Zones 1 and 2 were highly overcooled (i.e. the temperatures in the two zones were much lower than other zones), due to a mismatch between cooling demand and supply. As a result, the relative humidity in these two zones was significantly higher than that in the other zones, which exceeded the higher limit (Fig. 3B) in the operating period (8:00\u201318:00) and resulted in the operation of heaters. As shown in Fig. 3C, even though the MAU cooling coil valve was fully open, the cooling capacity did not meet the required cooling or dehumidification demand. Therefore, systems resorted to overcooling and reheating processes. The low energy-efficiency of the pharmaceutical cleanroom air-conditioning system is due to the following reasons. (1). In multiple zone air-conditioning systems, due to the limited throttling ranges of supply air temperature and volume, the need to satisfy all the demands may lead to overcooling and overdrying in some critical zones when the cooling demand among different zones has large discrepancies. This situation becomes more serious in cleanrooms, as the supply air volume should not only meet cooling but also filtration demands. This indicates the supply air volume for each zone should be optimally set according to both the temperature and particle concentrations in each zone. (2). The existing ventilation strategy cannot be adaptive to dynamic operating conditions and actual component capacities. As in Fig. 3C, the cooling coil valve of the MAU was kept fully open due to an overestimation of MAU cooling capacity. This indicates the outdoor (make-up) air volume should be optimally set according to system hardware information and operating conditions. (3). The existing ventilation strategy adopts a separate operation between outdoor air and supply air ventilation systems, which cannot fully take the advantage of existing design and subsequently results in significant energy waste. Electronic Supplementary Material (ESM) Fig. A-2 and Fig. A-3 show the important variables on the energy performance of cleanroom air-conditioning systems through sensitivity analysis. It is found that manufacturing process latent load, outdoor air flowrate and supply air flowrate were the three most influential parameters on cleanroom air-conditioning energy use. As the process latent load is often unpredictable and highly influenced by manufacturing activities, the energy efficiency of cleanroom air-conditioning systems highly depends on whether the total supply and outdoor air volumes are properly set. The existing ventilation strategy sets the total supply air and outdoor air volumes as constants, which may restrict the potential energy savings in cleanrooms. This necessitates the development of a proper ventilation strategy, which can optimize the volumes of both the total supply air and outdoor air to improve the system's overall energy efficiency. 3 Proposed coordinated demand-controlled ventilation strategy 3.1 Basic idea and its comparison with existing ventilation strategies The basic idea of the proposed coordinated demand-controlled ventilation (CDCV) strategy is presented in Fig. 4 . The proposed strategy includes two schemes: the total supply air volume optimization scheme and the outdoor air volume optimization scheme. The main objective of the total supply air volume optimization scheme is to minimize the total supply air volume (or minimize the supply fan energy) while fulfilling the requirements of both the temperature and cleanliness controls. The supply air volume for each zone is determined by selecting the minimum required flow rate to satisfy both zone cooling demand and filtration demand. The main objective of the outdoor air volume optimization scheme is to reduce unnecessary cold-heat offsets while fulfilling the requirements of the pressure and humidity controls. A minimum outdoor airflow rate is required to maintain acceptable indoor air quality for occupants and requisite pressurization while the actual outdoor air volume (i.e. no less than this minimum threshold) is determined through the adaptive full-range decoupled ventilation (ADV) strategy. More details relating to the ADV strategy can be found in a previous study by the authors [22]. A comparison between the proposed strategy and three reference strategies can be found in Table 2 . Strategy 1 (original strategy) is adopted by the site case and its working principles were presented in Section 2. For Strategy 2, the outdoor air volume is optimized by adopting the ADV strategy while the supply air volume is kept constant to meet cleanliness requirements under design conditions. The ADV strategy contains two operation modes, a PD mode and a DV mode, with the more economical outdoor air ventilation mode chosen per time step. The outdoor air volume under the PD mode is kept at its lower limit to ensure indoor pressurization and acceptable indoor air quality, while the outdoor air volume under the DV mode can be adjusted higher than its lower limit according to the indoor latent load to avoid overcooling and reheating processes. For Strategy 3, the outdoor air volume keeps constant through the PD strategy while the supply air volume is determined through the DCF strategy. The supply air volume under the DCF strategy is set to meet both the indoor contamination level and cooling demand with the assumption that the indoor temperature and particle concentration are controlled at their higher limit setpoints. For the proposed CDCV strategy, both the outdoor air volume and supply air volume are optimally set, which can offer optimized energy-efficient operation by combining the advantages of Strategies 2 and 3. Compared with existing ventilation strategies, the proposed strategy has three main advantages: (1). It can reduce the mismatch between cooling demand and supply to minimize energy waste. (2). It can reduce the total supply air volume to save supply air fan energy. (3). It can reduce unnecessary subcooling and reheating processes by coordinating the operation of each air-conditioning component. 3.2 Performance evaluation 3.2.1 Quantification of multi-zone cooling demand diversity Due to the asynchronous demand behavior among different zones, the mismatch between cooling supply and cooling demands/loads indeed exists. The discrepancy between the demand and supply side may vary with changes in demand diversity levels. In this study, the Lorenz curve and Gini coefficient, which are commonly used in economics to represent income inequality, are used to describe the cooling demand diversity of multiple zones [25]. With this concept, both the spatial inequality (i.e., the uneven load distribution among zones) and temporal inequality (i.e., the load variation along time) of zone cooling loads can be represented in a quantitative way [27]. Fig. 5 presents a typical Lorenz curve and the definition of the Gini coefficient. Here, the Lorenz curve's horizontal axis represents the cumulative share of the number of zones in the order of lowest to highest dimensionless cooling demand, and the vertical axis represents the cumulative share of cooling demands. For instance, for the horizontal axis, if there are 5 zones, then the share of each zone (or each step) is 20%. Dimensionless cooling demand (λ) is shown in Eq. (1), where Q i is the cooling demand of zone i (kW) and Q rated,i is the rated cooling demand of zone i (kW). When λ is the dimensionless sensible cooling demand, both Q i and Q rated,i stand for the sensible cooling demand. Similarly, when λ is the dimensionless latent cooling demand, both Q i and Q rated,i stand for the latent cooling demand. The equality line (45°) represents the perfect equality of loads between different zones. The Gini coefficient is a quantitative index representing load diversity between zones, or the ratio of the area lying between the equality line and the Lorenz curve (BAD) over the area under the equality line (BCD). A smaller Gini coefficient indicates a higher similarity among zones. The Gini coefficient can also be calculated using Eq. (2), where n is the number of zones and λ \u203e is the mean value of dimensionless demand. (1) λ i = Q i / Q r a t e d , i (2) G i n i = 1 − 1 n 2 λ \u203e ∑ i = 1 n ( 2 n − 2 i + 1 ) λ i G i n i ∈ [ 0,1 ] Fig. 6 shows examples of the cooling load distribution and Lorenz curve of 11 zones under two operating conditions. It can be found that the cooling loads among zones in Case 1 varied significantly, resulting in a larger Gini coefficient (0.31). In contrast, the cooling load distributions in Case 2 varied within a relatively narrow range, resulting in a very close distance between the equality line and Lorenz curve, and therefore a smaller Gini coefficient (0.05). Thus, the Lorenz curve and the Gini coefficient can be used to effectively quantify multi-zone demand diversity. 3.2.2 Quantification of mismatch level between cooling demand and supply In multiple zone air-conditioning systems, due to the limited throttling range of supply air temperature and air volume, as well as the fact that the supply air temperature and humidity are the same across different zones, the need to satisfy both cooling and dehumidification demands inevitably results in overcooling and overdrying in some zones. However, the mismatch between cooling demand and supply is significantly affected by the ventilation strategy adopted. In this study, the degree of overcooling (Degree oc ) and the degree of overdrying (Degree od ) are adopted to quantify the mismatch between cooling demand and supply, represented by Eqs. (3) and (4): (3) D e g r e e o c = Q s , s e n Q d , s e n = ∑ V s , i ( t s e t , i − t s ) ∑ V s , i ( t i − t s ) D e g r e e o c ≥ 1 (4) D e g r e e o d = Q s , l a t Q d , l a t = ∑ V s , i ( ω s e t , i − ω s ) ∑ V s , i ( ω i − ω s ) D e g r e e o d ≥ 1 where, Q s,sen and Q s,lat are the total sensible and latent cooling supply of the system (kW) respectively. Q d,sen and Q d,lat are the total sensible and latent cooling demand of all served zones (kW). t s is the total supply air temperature (°C). t i is the indoor temperature of zone i (°C). t set,i is the cooling setpoint of zone i (°C). ω s is the total supply air humidity (kg/kg). ω i is the indoor humidity of zone i (kg/kg). ω set,i is the humidity setpoint of zone i (kg/kg). V s,i is the supply air volume of zone i (m3/s). As t i is normally not higher than t set,i , Degree oc and Degree od are normally greater than or equal to 1. When the degree approaches 1, there is a good match between the cooling supply and the cooling demand. The detailed calculation process for determining the air volumes and states can be found in Section 3.2.4. 3.2.3 Air-conditioning subsystem energy models The total electrical load (W tot ) of the cleanroom air-conditioning system can be calculated using Eq. (5), which includes the electrical loads of the MAU and AHU cooling coil (W cc,MAU and W cc,AHU ), AHU heater (W he,AHU ), AHU humidifier (W hu,AHU ), make-up air fan (W f,MAU ) as well as supply air fan (W f,AHU ). (5) W t o t = W c c , M A U + W c c , A H U + W h e , A H U + W h u , A H U + W f , M A U + W f , A H U Several simplified models are used to evaluate the electrical loads of these components as follows. Fan model: The power of MAU/AHU fans is represented by their volumetric flow rate, pressure rise and efficiency, as shown in Eq. (6): (6) W f = V Δ p η f where W f is the total fan power (kW), V is the air volumetric flow rate (m3/s), Δp is the total pressure rise (kPa) and η f is fan efficiency. System energy balance model: The cooling loads of the air-conditioning components are determined based on energy and mass balances, to process the air to the required total supply air state. W cc and W he are calculated according to their inlet and outlet air states as well as system coefficient of performance (COP) using Eqs. (7)\u2013(9): (7) W c c , M A U = ρ V f h ( h o u t , c c , M A U − h i n , c c , M A U ) C O P c (8) W c c , A H U = ρ V s u p ( h o u t , c c , A H U − h i n , c c , A H U ) C O P c (9) W h e , A H U = ρ V s u p ( h o u t , h e , A H U − h i n , h e , A H U ) C O P h e where h fg (2501 kJ/kg) is the latent heat of vaporization. ρ is air density (m3/kg). h out and h in are outlet and inlet air enthalpy (kJ/kg), respectively. In this study, the overall coefficient of performance of the central cooling system COP c including the pump and the chiller is assumed to be constant at 2.5 when calculating the overall electrical load [28], while COP he is assumed to be constant at 1.0 due to the heating energy is provided by the electric heaters [23]. The determination of air volumes and the inlet/outlet air states of air-conditioning components are further elaborated in section 3.2.4. 3.2.4 Detailed steps for energy performance evaluation and effectiveness assessment Detailed calculation processes for energy performance evaluation and effectiveness assessment under the proposed strategy are presented in Fig. 7 . First, the total supply air temperature t sup is determined by Eq. (10), where t set,i is the cooling setpoint of zone i (°C), Q sen,i is the sensible cooling demand of zone i (kW), V s,max,i is the maximum supply air volume of zone i (m3/s), and c p is the air specific heat ratio (kJ/(m3·°C)). V s,max,i is determined at the design stage using Eq. (11), where Q i is the design cooling load of zone i (kW) and Δt is the designed temperature differences between supply and return air (°C). (10) t s u p = min [ ( t s e t , 1 − Q s e n , 1 c p ρ V s , m a x , 1 ) , \u2026 , ( t s e t , i − Q s e n , i c p ρ V s , m a x , i ) , \u2026 , ( t s e t , n − Q s e n , n c p ρ V s , m a x , n ) ] (11) V s , m a x , i = Q i c p ρ Δ t Second, the supply air volume for each zone i is determined by Eq. (12), meeting both sensible cooling and filtration demand based on the assumption that the indoor temperature or particle concentration is controlled at corresponding higher limits (23 °C and 3.52 × 106 particle/m3 for particles equal to and greater than 0.5 μm respectively). It is assumed that the particle concertation of make-up air reaches the indoor contamination level due to the installation of multistage filters. The supply air volume of zone i meeting sensible cooling demand (V s,sen,i ) and filtration demand (V s,fil,i ) can be calculated with Eqs. 13 and 14 respectively. The optimal total supply air volume (Eq. (15)), the minimum required volume to simultaneously meet indoor cooling and filtration demand, is the sum of the supply air volume of each zone. Here, η is the HEPA filter efficiency, 99.95%. P s,i is the particle generation rate (particle/s) of zone i. C set,i is the particle concentration setpoint in zone i (particle/m3). (12) V s , i = max ( V s , s e n , i , V s , f i l , i ) (13) V s , s e n , i = Q s e n , i c p ρ ( t s e t , i − t s u p ) (14) V s , f i l , i = P S i C s e t , i ( 1 − η ) (15) V s u p = ∑ V s , i Third, the total supply air humidity ω sup can be determined if the latent load of the critical zone can be met as shown in Eq. (16). Here, Q lat,i is the latent cooling demand of zone i (kW). t i (Eq. (17)) and ω set,i (Eq. (18)) are the indoor air temperature and humidity setpoint of zone i respectively. ω set,i is obtained according to the indoor relative humidity setpoint (RH set = 65%) and t i of zone i. (16) ω s u p = min [ ( ω s e t , 1 − Q l a t , 1 h f g ρ V s , 1 ) , \u2026 , ( ω s e t , i − Q l a t , i h f g ρ V s , i ) , \u2026 , ( ω s e t , n − Q l a t , n h f g ρ V s , n ) ] (17) t i = t s u p + Q s e n , i c p ρ V s , i (18) ω s e t , i = f ( t i , R H s e t ) Fourth, based on the required supply air volume and states as well as the ambient conditions, the optimal outdoor air volume can be determined through the ADV strategy. The ADV strategy contains two outdoor air ventilation modes, PD and DV, with the more economical mode that enables the system to operate at the highest energy efficiency selected at each time step [29]. The processes of optimal selection are shown as follows: (a) Based on the determined supply air states, the required outdoor air flowrates of two operation modes (i.e., PD and DV) can be obtained by Eq. (19), where ω rtn is the return air humidity (kg/kg), V oa,min is the minimum required outdoor air flowrate (required for maintaining the acceptable indoor air quality and space positive pressure) and ω out,MAU is the outlet air humidity of the MAU (kg/kg). The outlet temperatures of the MAU are set as 13 °C, a setting typically used in practice [30], when dehumidification requirements are concerned. (b) The inlet and outlet air states of air-conditioning components are then determined following the working principles of the selected operation mode as presented by Fig. 1. (c) With the quantified outdoor air and supply air states and volumes, the total electrical load of the air-conditioning systems using two operation modes can be obtained using Eqs. (5)\u2013(9). (d) The ADV strategy will eventually determine the optimal outdoor air flowrate by selecting the operation mode with the minimum electrical load. That is, the minimum outdoor airflow rate (V oa,min ) would be selected if the PD mode is identified to be the economical mode. The outdoor airflow (V oa,DV ) that exceeds the V oa,min would be selected if the DV mode is identified to be the economical mode. (19) V o a = { V o a , D V = min { max [ V o a , min , V sup ( ω sup − ω s e t ) ω o u t , M A U − ω s e t ] , V sup } for DV mode V o a , P D = V o a , m i n f o r P D m o d e Last, the effectiveness of the proposed strategy is demonstrated by 1) quantifying the mismatch level between cooling supply and demand (presented in Sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2) and 2) calculating the electricity use (presented in Section 3.2.3). 4.1 Description of the test building A pharmaceutical factory building located in Hong Kong, a humid sub-tropical city, was selected for the case study, as shown in Fig. 8 . It has a height of around 32.5 m and a gross floor area of about 18,780 m2. The main zones in the building include cleanrooms, warehouses and offices. All production areas are Class ISO 8 cleanrooms based on ISO 14644-1 cleanroom standards [31]. The cleanrooms have strict requirements for dry bulb temperature, relative humidity and static pressure. The dry bulb temperature of all cleanrooms should be controlled between 17 °C and 23 °C, and the relative humidity should be within 35\u201365%. The static pressure requirement varies from 0 to 60 Pa depending on the function of the cleanroom. Fig. 9 shows the 11 cleanrooms concerned, on the top floor, with a total area of 198.2 m2 served by an air-conditioning subsystem. The air-conditioning subsystem has a similar configuration as shown in Fig. 2, providing constant cooling and dehumidification service for a total of 8760 h. 4.2 Test conditions The weather of Hong Kong is classified as \u201cHumid Subtropical Climate\u201d according to the climatological method of classification [32]. Between 1981 and 2010, the mean monthly temperature in Hong Kong ranged from 16.3 °C to 28.8 °C, and the mean monthly relative humidity ranged from 69% to 83% [33]. In this study, the typical meteorological year weather data [34] in Hong Kong were used to calculate the cooling loads when adopting different ventilation strategies. The design loads and schedules of lighting, occupancy and equipment were estimated according to the standards, field survey and machinery lists. The indoor temperature and relative humidity for each zone were set at a higher limit (23 °C, 65%) for the cooling load calculation. The indoor condition, building construction and ventilation system design parameters are summarized in Table 3 . It is worth noticing that, the input parameters of the indoor condition group were sampled following the predefined distributions and differed in each zone to consider the load diversities, while the building construction and ventilation system design parameters were constants in the trial year. Therefore, a total of 55 (5 indoor condition parameters × 11 zones) input parameters were sampled at each time step (i.e., 8760 sets in a year), as shown in Fig. 10 . Previous studies [17,18] found that humans are the predominant contamination source in cleanrooms, supporting the idea that occupancy can be used as an effective surrogate for particle concentrations. A person can release around 1 × 106 to 5 × 106 particles (≥0.5 μm) per min into a cleanroom, depending on the activity level [35]. Therefore, considering the most critical cleanliness requirement, the indoor particle concentration rate was set by multiplying the occupant number by the higher limit of occupant particle generation rate (i.e., 5 × 106/person/min). It is worth noticing that, in this study, it is assumed that the particle generation can be easily determined based on occupant number. In reality, it is possible that the actual particle generation may be affected by measurement uncertainties, the manufacturing process and indoor pressurization. 4.3 Model calibration As Hong Kong is a cooling dominated city, the predominant demand in cleanrooms is for space cooling [36]. The cleanroom energy simulation model developed by EnergyPlus (Fig. 9) was calibrated using real measured cooling loads from Jan 1 to Dec 31, 2016. In this study, the \u2018IdealLoadsAirSystem\u2019 model in EnergyPlus was used to calculate the space cooling loads without taking the cold-heat offsets into account. Therefore, the monthly actual space cooling loads (CL actual ) used for model calibration equals the measured cooling loads of chillers (CL chiller ) subtracting the double measured heating loads of electric heaters (HL chiller ) presented by Eq. (20). (20) C L a c t u a l = C L c h i l l e r − 2 × H L h e a t e r Two indicators commonly used for calibrating building energy simulation models [37] were adopted in this study. The mean bias error (MBE) and coefficient of variation of root mean square error CV(RMSE) were computed as Eqs (21) and (22) respectively: (21) MBE ( % ) = ∑ i = 1 N p ( r i − q i ) ∑ i = 1 N p ( r i ) (22) CV ( RMSE ) ( % ) = ∑ i = 1 N p ( r i − q i ) 2 / N p r \u203e where r i and q i are the measured and simulated data points for each model instance i , respectively. N p is the number of data points at interval p (i.e., N monthly = 12). r \u203e is the average of the measured data points. In this study, the accuracy of the cooling load of the present building model was assessed using the monthly criteria in ASHRAE Guideline 14 [38], in which the MBE and CV (RMSE) should be within ±5% and lower than 15%, respectively. Fig. 11 shows a good match between the output from the building model and the actual cooling load of the building. The MBE and CV (RMSE) between the measured and simulated cooling loads were −4.8% and 11.8% respectively, which fulfills the acceptance criteria of model calibration. 5 Annual energy performance assessment Following the steps for calculating the total electrical load of air-conditioning systems presented in Section 3.2.4, the annual energy uses of different ventilation strategies are summarized in Table 4 . Strategy 1 consumed the highest annual electricity, as both the outdoor air volume and supply air volume were not optimized. 17.3% of overall energy can be saved by optimizing the outdoor air volume only (i.e. adopting Strategy 2), and 52.3% of overall energy can be saved by optimizing the supply air volume only (i.e. adopting Strategy 3). The proposed strategy was the most energy-efficient ventilation strategy: 63.3% of overall energy can be saved by optimizing both the supply and outdoor air volumes. The highest MAU cooling energy, as well as the least AHU cooling, heating and fan energy, were consumed adopting the proposed strategy. 5.1 Mismatch alleviation between cooling supply and demand by optimizing supply air volume Fig. 12 presents the Gini indexes between the supply and demand sides with and without supply air volume optimization. The x-axis presents the Gini index of cooling demand in different zones, and the y-axis presents the Gini index of the cooling supply in different zones. The equality line (45°) indicates that the zone cooling supply can perfectly match the zone cooling demand. Each point represents a match level between the supply side and demand side at a time step (i.e. 1 h). As shown in Fig. 12A, the Gini index of cooling supply of Strategies 1 and 2 (fixed supply air volume without optimization) was lower than 0.02, which indicated the cooling supply for each zone was synchronous regardless of the cooling demand diversities. As shown in Fig. 12B, the supply air volume of Strategy 3 and the proposed strategy could be adjusted to match the cooling demand of each zone to the greatest extent possible. Therefore, the Gini index of cooling supply adopting the strategy with supply air volume optimization was always larger than that without optimization. However, due to the requirements of indoor cleanliness control as well as the limited throttling ranges, the cooling demand and supply of Strategy 3 and the proposed strategy cannot be perfectly matched. As a result, the Gini index of the supply side should be smaller or equal to that of the demand side (the points were all under the 45° equality line). Due to the strict temperature and humidity requirements in cleanrooms, air-conditioning systems should satisfy both the sensible and latent cooling demands of all zones. When the Gini index of the supply side is smaller than that of the demand side or a mismatch between cooling supply and demand exists, overcooling and overdrying may occur in some zones. Fig. 13 and Fig. 14 show the degrees of overcooling and overdrying at different Gini indexes respectively, to represent the mismatch level between cooling demand and cooling supply in the year-round simulation. The distributions of the degrees of overcooling and overdrying are presented in the small figures, where the box plots, midline and whiskers represent the range between the 25th-75th percentile, the median, and the minima-maxima respectively. The large degree of overcooling and overdrying indicates significant energy waste. Generally, both the degrees of overcooling and overdrying increased as the Gini index of cooling demand increased. This indicates the phenomena of overcooling and overdrying in cleanroom air-conditioning systems become severe when the diversity of zone cooling demand increases. As shown in Fig. 13, the overcooling degree ranged between 1.09 and 2.45 with a mean of 1.45 when adopting Strategies 1 and 2, while it varied between 1.00 and 1.36 with a mean of 1.02 under the proposed strategy and Strategy 3. As shown in Fig. 14, the overdrying degree ranged between 3.16 and 10.51 with a mean of 6.58 when adopting Strategies 1 and 2, while it varied between 1.11 and 5.59 with a mean of 2.29 under the proposed strategy and Strategy 3. Under the same diverse level of cooling demand, the degrees of overcooling and overdrying were always greater under Strategies 1 and 2 than under Strategy 3 and the proposed strategy. These results prove that overcooling and overdrying can be alleviated through the optimization of supply air volume for each zone, as the cooling supply can be adjusted to match the cooling demand. By comparing Figs. 13 and 14, it is found that the degree of overdrying was much higher than the degree of overcooling. The reason is that some zones were overcooled (i.e. lower than the higher limit setpoint 23 °C) due to a mismatch between cooling supply and asynchronous cooling demand. As the higher limit of the relative humidity of zones is 65%, the higher limit of zone absolute humidity therefore decreases as the indoor temperature falls. This may increase the demand for dehumidification to ensure the humidity control for the critical zone. Therefore, the overcooling of some zones subsequently aggravated the overdrying of other zones. 5.2 The impacts of supply air volume optimization on optimal outdoor air ventilation mode The optimization of supply air volume may directly influence outdoor air ventilation. Fig. 15 A shows the total supply ACH under four ventilation strategies. Strategies 1 and 2 adopted a constant supply air volume with 21.3 ACH, while Strategy 3 and the proposed strategy allowed the supply air volume to vary according to indoor particle concentration and sensible cooling demand. The mean supply air volume under Strategy 3 and the proposed strategy during the test year was 14.7, which is 69.0% of the air volume under Strategies 1 and 2. This led to a significant energy reduction of 31.2% (16.1 vs 23.4 MW h) for the supply fan. Fig. 15B shows the outdoor ACH under four ventilation strategies. Strategies 1 and 3 adopted a constant outdoor air volume with 2 ACH, while Strategy 2 and the proposed strategy both adopted the ADV strategy, which enables the outdoor air volume to vary to avoid sub-cooling and reheating as far as beneficial via optimal use of the MAU for dehumidification. The outdoor air volume under Strategy 2 was higher than in the proposed strategy in cold weather conditions, but was lower than in the proposed strategy in hot weather conditions. This is because a reduction of supply air volume may affect the selection of outdoor air operation mode and subsequently outdoor air volumes. As presented in Fig. 14, the overdrying degree when supply air volume was not optimized was higher than when it was. Therefore, in the cold weather conditions where the outdoor air volume was set following the indoor latent demand (i.e. adopting the DV mode), the required air outdoor volume under Strategy 2 was larger than under the proposed strategy. By contrast, under hot weather conditions, due to the high indoor latent demand and outdoor air enthalpy, the PD mode was frequently selected (running frequency of 66.4%) as the outdoor air ventilation mode under Strategy 2. Under the proposed strategy, due to reduced indoor latent demands, the DV mode was frequently selected (running frequency of 81.0%) as the outdoor air ventilation mode, resulting in the highest MAU cooling energy use amongst the four strategies. This indicates that subcooling and reheating processes are dramatically decreased by adopting the proposed strategy. As also shown in Table 4, compared with Strategies 1, 2 and 3, 89.6%, 86.6% and 70.9% of heating energy respectively can be saved by adopting the proposed strategy. 6 Conclusions In this study, a coordinated demand-controlled ventilation strategy for multi-zone cleanroom air-conditioning systems was developed and tested using a case study. Cooling load diversity as well as mismatches between cooling demand and supply were quantified to demonstrate the effectiveness of implementing the proposed strategy. Cleanrooms in a pharmaceutical factory located in Hong Kong, a humid sub-tropical city, were selected to test and validate the proposed ventilation strategy. The annual system energy performance under the proposed ventilation strategy was also evaluated, and compared with existing strategies. Based on the results of the tests, some conclusions can be drawn: o The proposed ventilation strategy can achieve significant energy savings by coordinating operations between outdoor and supply ventilation systems. Compared with existing ventilation strategies, up to 89.6% of reheating and 63.3% of overall energy use can be saved. o The mismatch between cooling supply and demand can be significantly alleviated by optimizing the supply air volume. The mean degree of overcooling was reduced to 1.02 from 1.45 and the mean degree of overdrying was reduced to 2.29 from 6.58. o Optimizing supply air volume affects the optimal outdoor air ventilation mode. The partially decoupled control (running frequency of 66.4%) and dedicated outdoor air ventilation (running frequency of 81.0%) were the dominant outdoor air ventilation modes under the strategy optimizing only outdoor air ventilation and the proposed strategy respectively. This indicates that the coordination of outdoor and supply air ventilation systems is essential for energy-efficient cleanroom operation. In this study, the performance of the \u201ccoordinated demand-controlled ventilation strategy\u201d, as well as the other strategies, is evaluated under the condition that ideal controls are adopted. Besides this, the characteristic of particle generation and quantification of the particle sources remain an issue to be addressed. The online control strategy still needs further testing in an actual cleanroom air-conditioning system to confirm its potentials of energy-efficient and reliable operation considering measurement uncertainties, real-time particle generation and actual hardware design.

The causes of this are mainly high air change rates and counteraction (i.e. overcooling and reheating) processes in applications. Existing studies have addressed the design and control of outdoor and supply air ventilation systems separately without considering the interaction between them, which causes significant energy waste. This study therefore proposes a coordinated demand-controlled ventilation (CDCV) strategy to achieve energy-efficient operation in multi-zone cleanroom air-conditioning systems, by coordinating operation between outdoor and supply ventilation systems. The Lorenz curve and Gini index are introduced to quantify the demand diversity of multiple zones, and degrees of overcooling and overdrying are used to quantify the mismatch between cooling supply and demand. Cleanrooms in a pharmaceutical factory located in Hong Kong, a humid sub-tropical city, are selected to test and validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. Test results show that the optimization of supply air volume can alleviate the mismatch between cooling supply and demand, as well as affect the optimal outdoor air ventilation mode. The proposed strategy can achieve up to 89.6% of reheating and 63.3% of overall energy savings.",
