Forecasting technologies aiming to reduce building electricity consumption and costs have recently been developed. However, to design a more accurate forecasting model using a physical-based approach, complicated mathematical modeling and multi-variable parameters and constraints must be considered. Moreover, single data-driven models usually have a high generalization error regarding previously unseen data. Most hybrid forecasting models usually do not consider shaving the peak demand costs based on time of use (TOU) to save building electricity costs. To overcome this limitation, we propose a data-driven hybrid forecasting model and an operating algorithm to shave the peak demand costs based on the TOU. The proposed model and algorithm are expected to reduce peak demand costs by 22%. In addition, the experimental results indicate that the hybrid model can reduce generalization errors because it improves the forecasting performance, achieving the highest recall (91.01%) among other models using a previously unseen test dataset. Keywords Data-driven technique Peak demand costs Time of use Deep learning Hybrid model 1 Introduction The industrial revolution has promoted urbanization and industrialization for economic and social modernization [1]. Urbanization and industrialization have significant impacts on the increase in energy consumption and electricity costs. During the past two decades, technologies related to reducing energy consumption have received significant attention. It has been reported that residential energy consumption will account for a large proportion of various energy sources by 2030 [2]. Building energy consumption has accounted for a large amount of energy in the area of residential energy consumption. Technologies related to the reduction of building energy consumption and costs have recently been introduced. The energy modeling techniques used to improve the building energy efficiency have largely been divided into two parts: physical-based and data-driven models. An example of a physical-based model [3] was presented using an optimized decision from a mathematical energy model for a chiller plant, a cooling tower model, and an optimization algorithm. An overall energy model of a chiller plant was developed to capture the thermal behavior of all systems and their interactions including the power consumption. As an alternative modeling of a physical-based model, a data-driven technique [4,5] for the building energy performance can provide cost-effective opportunities to reduce the building energy consumption. Independently collected and maintained datasets have been presented to build a database of unprecedented size. Such data-driven algorithms can be utilized with empirical data to estimate the energy savings associated with building retrofits. In particular, in [6] it was reported that owing to the ease of use and adaptability in finding an optimal solution, data-driven forecasting techniques have become accurate and efficient tools in recent years. The review results in [7] demonstrate that data-driven approaches have addressed a large variety of building-energy related applications well, such as load forecasting and prediction, energy pattern profiling, and regional energy-consumption mapping. Physical-based approaches usually require detailed information for complex building phenomenon, whereas data-driven approaches simply need a large amount of data for modeling. This article reviewed the data-driven approaches used in a building-energy analysis, including artificial neural networks, support vector machines, statistical regression, a decision tree, and a genetic algorithm, and explored possible energy reduction opportunities for establishing better urban strategies. In addition, the article in [8] addressed the advantages of data-driven techniques for building energy consumption. Optimization-based control algorithms, such as model predictive control (MPC), have certain advantages such as no training data required and the use of a generalized deterministic model. However, it is well known that a data-driven technique has an advantage of fast computations based on real-time data and suitability for non-linear modeling. When applying an optimized technique such as an MPC method, the optimized technique is usually considered based on related multi-variable parameters, constraints, and a mathematical model for forecasting. In addition, there are several issues in determining whether to develop a simple forecasting model or a complex model. Therefore, data-driven techniques such as machine learning or deep learning are useful modeling approaches and have been widely used for building performance optimization. In this paper, we propose an efficient data-driven hybrid forecasting model and operating algorithm to shave the peak demand costs based on the time of use (TOU) for saving electricity costs in a building. The hybrid model forecasts the maximum demand zone at the TOU. Then, the operating algorithm reduces the peak demand costs with the predicted results of the hybrid model to forecast the peak demand zone within the maximum demand zone based on the TOU of the Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO). The algorithm operates the solar energy, the energy storage system (ESS) [9] and the utility electricity based on the priorities. Considering these characteristics, the proposed hybrid model and operating algorithm could be used as an application to reduce the peak demand costs based on the TOU for building electricity management. Section 2 introduces various types of studies on forecasting energy consumption for a building. In Section 3, we propose a hybrid forecasting model and an operating algorithm. In Section 4, we address the experimental results of the forecasting ability of the proposed model and the effectiveness of the operating algorithm for shaving the peak demand costs based on the TOU. Finally, we discuss the advantages of the proposed model and algorithm when applying the method to the grid. (See Table 1 ). 2 Literature review The physical-based model is basically based on the science of building physics. This method does not need training data for modeling and prefers a generalized approach. In [10], physical-based model predictive control (MPC) was presented. This model applies a combination of optimization-based control algorithms, such as MPC and a data-based machine learning algorithm. The article described a physical building model converted into a linearized model. Data acquisition is implemented through the MPC design. Next, machine learning models were selected and the learning process was finally applied. Machine learning models such as MLP, time delay neural networks, and regression trees (RT) were used to derive the dependency of multiple real-valued control inputs on the parameters. Dimensionality reduction algorithms were used through a straightforward manual selection and a principal component analysis (PCA) to improve the efficiency of the model. The results showed that simplified control laws retain most of the performance of a complex MPC, while significantly decreasing the complexity and implementation cost. Data driven methods have also been studied during the past 20 years. Data driven models include various machine learning or deep learning models. Among them, an artificial neural network (ANN) has been a representative machine learning model for building energy forecasting. The ANN model is a neural network that similarly imitates the functionality of the human brain with processing units called neurons, which have the cognitive ability to receive input data. In [11], various ANN models were reviewed. The ANN forecasting models for buildings have grown significantly within the past few decades owing to their increased performance, robustness, and easy deployment. The paper reported that ANN models have been used in a feed forward neural network with several hyperparameters. In addition, most of applications of an ANN have been applied to commercial buildings and the performance of the ANN models showed a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for single step ahead forecasting of 0.001\u201336.5%, and a MAPE of 1.04\u201342.31% for multistep ahead forecasting. In [12], ANN prediction models were developed using 5 years of observed data and five different parameters, namely, solar radiation, temperature, wind speed, humidity, and weekday data. The article showed that the ANN model performs better than four other techniques with a MAPE of 6%, whereas multiple regression (MR), genetic programming (GP), a support vector machine (SVM), and deep neural networks (DNNs) have a MAPE of 8.5%, 8.7%, 9%, and 11%, respectively. In [13], the authors presented an example of a multi-objective optimization model using an ANN and a genetic algorithm (GA) to quantitatively assess the technological choices in a building retrofit project. In [14], an ANN model was employed for normal load forecasting, and statistical forecasting models were employed to address the probabilistic occurrence and magnitude of the abnormal peak load. The article [15] proposed a new multi-stage framework for a cost-optimal analysis using multi-objective optimization and an ANN model. In [16], a feed-forward ANN model was used. The inputs used in the models for the HC system and the EHP were selected through a variable selection process based on domain knowledge and a correlation analysis. Among the different machine learning techniques, a decision tree (DT) model is a type of algorithm used to operate a sequence of branching decisions. The decision tree model in [17] was utilized as a type of building energy forecasting. This study presented a decision support model to maintain the electric energy consumption of elementary school facilities and make decisions on facility improvements. In particular, the forecasting accuracy was improved using a combination model incorporating a GA, an ANN, and a multiple regression analysis (MRA). The k-nearest neighbor model (k-NN) is a machine learning technique that classifies datasets based on their similarities. A k-NN has been utilized as a classification or regression method, and is called an instance-based learning or lazy learner because it only classifies datasets based on local similarities. The k-NN method has often been applied to the data preprocessing field as an input dataset of various machine learning or deep learning models. In [18], a k-NN classifier was utilized for daily building energy consumption. The original data containing the hourly consumption of 520 apartments in South Korea were used for the experimentation, and the effectiveness of the k-NN model was validated using 10- and 5-fold cross validations. A support vector machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning method that performs classification and regression using a hyperplane to distinguish between two datasets. A hyperplane is a classification plane between two datasets. An SVM finds the best classification to maximize the margin. It is mainly employed for a binary classification and can be applied to nonlinear classification. An SVM can solve the classification problem by linearizing the data through a high-dimensional transformation. A support vector regression (SVR) model employs the regression concept using a hyperplane and margin. It adjusts the margins by employing hyper parameters to allow the maximum amount of data present within the margin. SVR models have also been utilized to predict the energy consumption including linear and nonlinear data classification. In [19], the authors describe an example of a cascade of SVR models, which can forecast the target variables of an HVAC system, and apply data mining techniques for preprocessing to improve the forecasting model. In [20], several machine and deep learning techniques were applied for building load prediction. First, a feature extraction of the engineering features, statistical features, and auto encoders was utilized as an input to improve the prediction performance. In addition, the best forecasting performance was obtained using various prediction methods: linear regression, random forest, gradient boosting trees, and an SVR. In particular, an auto encoder, which is a type of neural network, has been widely used in feature extraction and outlier detection. The auto encoder consists of two parts: an encoder that transforms the input into a code vector and a decoder that transforms the code vector into the original input. The code vector can be utilized as a key feature of the input for the building load prediction. In [21], the auto encoder model can detect anomalies in the building energy data. An auto-encoder-based ensemble method was also proposed to analyze complex and large-scale building data for an effective building data analysis. In [22], the authors investigated the usefulness of deep learning techniques for forecasting the building energy. Both auto encoder techniques and generative adversarial networks (GAN) were employed to extract the features. A regression, an ANN, and extreme gradient boosting trees were utilized as a forecasting method. In [22], the authors demonstrated that deep learning techniques can be utilized to improve the building energy predictions for an automated energy forecasting. Long short-term memory (LSTM) as a time-series deep neural network has become a popular research topic in forecasting building energy consumption. The LSTM model is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN). The RNN model usually maintains long-term dependencies of the input sequences. However, the RNN has a gradient vanishing problem, which means the back propagated gradient can vanish or explode. Therefore, the LSTM model can be an alternative to solving the gradient vanishing issue by maintaining long-term dependencies. In [23], the LSTM model was applied to forecasting a building load. The results of the study indicate that the LSTM can reduce the prediction error and can promote an accurate load prediction for building control. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is a type of machine learning used to conduct an optimal action using a reward and punishment based on the observed state of the environment. In [24], the authors presented a comparison among DRL models, common supervised models, and three supervised prediction techniques, namely, multiple linear regression (MLR), a back propagation neural network (BPNN), and a random forest (RF), used for forecasting the building energy consumption. Ensemble learning is a machine learning method for incorporating multiple base models to generate the final output and achieve a good performance metric. An ensemble is basically a combination method that can avoid an overfitting, and tends to show better accuracy than a single model. In [25], an ensemble model incorporating eight base models was developed and optimized using a GA. The model finally forecasts the next-day energy consumption and peak demand. The GA was employed to optimize the weights of eight base models in the ensemble architecture, and presented the final prediction results of the next-day daily peak power demand and daily energy consumption. In [26], the authors reported an ensemble model using data obtained from meteorological systems and building-level occupancy and meters. The ensemble model utilized the bootstrap aggregating bagging technique to improve the prediction performance of a classification and regression tree (CART). The proposed model showed improved accuracy for forecasting the hourly electricity demand of a building. Artificial intelligence (AI) and ensemble models were also reviewed in [27]. The article provided a comprehensive review of ensemble prediction models and introduced various ensemble frameworks, namely, a generic framework and heterogeneous and homogeneous ensemble models. The article discussed the efficiency of the forecasting model when applying an AI-based method and revealed that combining multiple single AI-based prediction models can improve the prediction accuracy. In [28], a random forest (RF) was used as an ensemble model consisting of different regression trees with random sampling data from a raw dataset. The RF-based models were trained through a random feature selection, and the RF was compared with other machine learning models, namely, a regression tree (RT) and support vector regression (SVR), to validate the proposed model in terms of building energy forecasting. The forecasting performance of the proposed model was 14\u201325% and 5\u20135.5% better than that of the RT and SVR, respectively. In [29], gene expression programming (GEP) and a group method of data handling (GMDH) networks were employed to forecast short-term building electrical energy consumption for a large hospital in the Eastern Mediterranean. The GMDH model is a type of polynomial neural network. The model operates as a self-organizing network, which means neuron connections, the number of selected neurons, the layers, and the neurons in the hidden layers are not constant and are self-acting along with the training of an optimal model to reduce generalization errors. In the above, we addressed the various forecasting techniques of building energy consumption. The proposed forecasting model and algorithm show several noble features compared to the above studies described in the literature review as follows: \u2022 The proposed hybrid model provides the forecast results using a hybrid approach incorporating the three types of models for reducing electricity costs in a building as a robust forecasting model. \u2022 The operating algorithm can provide the shaved peak demand costs based on the scheduling of solar energy, utility electricity, and ESS in accordance with the forecast results of the proposed model. 3 Proposed architecture and algorithm In this section, the proposed hybrid architecture and algorithm are introduced. First, we address the electricity flow concept of the main power grid, solar energy, and ESS for the target building electricity consumption, as shown in Fig. 1 . Basically, the building can use the electricity from a utility company. To reduce the building electricity costs efficiently, the building can ultimately reduce the peak demand costs through an effective method applying electricity from an ESS or solar energy instead of using the main power grid electricity within the maximum demand zone of the TOU. The target building is an 18-story office building, i.e., the Korea Electric Power Corporation Knowledge Data & Network (KEPCO KDN) headquarters located in Naju City, South Korea. The detailed information for the building is provided in Table 2 . The building is supplied by 22.9 kV feeder line, which is connected to power distribution grid. The transformer capacity is 7900 kW. The transformer lowers the voltage of the electricity from 22.9 kV to the low levels of 220/380 voltage for the building.Fig. 2 shows the average monthly electricity consumption profile (June 1, 2015 to August 2, 2018) for the target building. The average monthly electricity consumption in the summer (Jun.-Aug.) is the highest and the consumption in the winter (Nov.\u2013Feb.) is the second-highest level. Especially, the electricity consumption for cooling accounts for 24% in the summer and the electricity consumption for heating accounts for 14% in the winter. We developed the proposed model using a hybrid architecture, as shown in Fig. 3 . To do so, we utilized original electricity data (June 1, 2015 to August 2, 2018) obtained from the target building. In addition, we utilized the outdoor temperature data (June 1, 2015 to August 2, 2018) for the proposed model. The outdoor temperature characteristics are shown in Fig. 4 . The temperature data were obtained from the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA). The entire dataset is divided into training and test data at a ratio of 70% (June 1, 2015 to August 22, 2017) to 30% (August 23, 2017 to August 2, 2018), respectively. The hybrid approach consists of three types of models, namely, a previous-day-based model, a moving average, and an LSTM deep learning model. The combination module of the hybrid model combines the results of the three forecasting models with an OR logical combination through the parallel learning process, and the combination ultimately contributes to a robust model for addressing the changeable and unpredictable consumption of building electricity. The operating algorithm finally organizes the optimized scheduling of utility electricity, solar energy, and ESS to efficiently reduce the peak demand costs. Tables 3 and 4 show the electricity usage fee and time zone within the demand zone and season of the KEPCO TOU in South Korea. As shown in Tables 3 and 4, the electricity usage fee varies depending on the demand and time zones. Specifically, the fee within the maximum demand zone is fairly high compared with that under a low load and within the medium demand zone. Our hybrid model accurately forecasts the peak demand under fairly high electricity consumption within the maximum demand zone of the KEPCO TOU, and the proposed algorithm provides the optimum operating scheduling of the ESS, solar energy, and utility power. Finally, we can efficiently reduce the peak demand costs in the maximum demand zone of the KEPCO TOU. The proposed concept can reduce the peak demand costs within the maximum demand zone of the KEPCO TOU and potentially offer an aggregate peak demand reduction in the entire building by applying the proposed model and operating algorithm in an efficient manner. When we consider that each building can reduce its own peak demand costs by efficiently applying the proposed method, the effects of reducing the aggregate peak demand of the main power grid will contribute to greater power grid stability. 3.1 Data preprocessing The original data are preprocessed into the appropriate input data format for the hybrid model. We generate the input dataset of the proposed model for forecasting the peak demand zone of the KEPCO TOU. In the prior study [30], we introduced three key parameters: the slope index (SI), cumulative slope (CS), and cumulative slope index (CSI). The SI [30] is defined as the variation in electricity usage for each time zone as follows: (1) SI n = P n - P n - 1 T n - T n - 1 where n is the time interval, P n is the electricity usage, and T n is the time zone [0..23]. The CS [30] is calculated as the sum of the current SI and the previous CS as follows: (2) CS n = SI n + CS n - 1 The CSI [30] is defined as the percentage ratio of the CS divided by the maximum CS as follows: (3) CSI n = CS n CS max × 100 [ % ] where CS max is the highest CS n within the time zone [0..23]. In addition, there are six maximum demand zones of the TOU each day. We define the maximum demand duration (MDD) to find the peak demand within these six maximum demand zones of the TOU each day. The MDD can be defined as follows: \u2022 A total of six maximum demand zones in the KEPCO TOU each day \u2022 A value of 1 in the case of CSI ⩾ 80 % ; otherwise a value of zero We considered the following details for defining the threshold (80%) of the MDD. There are six maximum load zones of KEPCO TOU each day. Normally, ESS has the rated capacity. The ESS charging or discharging each day is limited by the capacity. In addition, frequent cycles of discharge can make the ESS lifecycle generally shorter. Therefore, it is important to charge or discharge the ESS appropriately in the maximum load zones of KEPCO TOU. In our case, when the threshold is over 80%, the ESS storage can have the possibility not to be properly utilized. Especially when the electricity usage pattern has the fluctuating characteristics (irregular electricity pattern) and the threshold is under 80%, the ESS storage can have the possibility to discharge frequently in the maximum load zone of KEPCO TOU. Considering these restrictions and the observation results of an experienced building operator for the target building, the MDD threshold is defined when the CSI is over 80% in this paper. Fig. 5 describes the CSI and MDD input dataset formats. The row of the data format denotes each date, the n subscript denotes the last number field of the recent date, the CSI column denotes the CSI features at the time zone [0..23], and the MDD column denotes the MDD features within the six maximum demand zones. We use these parameters to find the peak demand within the maximum demand zone of the KEPCO TOU. A description of the input dataset for the proposed model is provided in Table 5 . The input of previous-day-based model among the three models considered consists of the CSI dataset in the time zone [0..23] including the workday only. The input of the moving average consists of the electricity power dataset for the last 2 weeks including the workday only. The input of the LSTM model consists of the CSI dataset in time zone [0..23] for the previous 5 days including the workday only, and we add the temperature dataset to the LSTM model input for an analysis of the temperature effect. The input of the MLP model as a benchmark model consists of the CSI dataset in the time zone [0..23] for the previous 5 days including the workday only. Regarding to the workday only, the target building is an office building where 1,000 or more employees are working. The employees do not work on weekends and holidays. Therefore, the peak demand patterns exist only on workdays in the office building. The propose model and operating algorithm are used in the workday only. The workday only normally indicates the weekdays excluding weekends and holidays. For example, if the workdays are between Monday and Friday (weekdays from 1 to 5, and from 8 to 12) and the weekends are between Saturday and Sunday (weekends from 6 to 7, and from 13 to 14), the input of the previous-day-based-model among the three models is Friday (weekday, 12) when we forecast Monday (weekday, 15). The input of the LSTM model is the last five days (weekdays from 8 to 12) when we forecast Monday (weekday, 15). The input of the moving average is the last two weeks (weekdays from 1 to 5, and from 8 to 12) when we forecast Monday (weekday, 15). 3.2 Hybrid model The hybrid approach consists of three models: a previous-day-based model, moving average, and deep learning-based LSTM model. The previous-day-based model is based on the assumption that the forecasting electricity pattern will be similar to the electricity pattern of the previous day. The previous-day-based model applies the MDD pattern extracted from the CSI pattern of the previous day to the forecasting results. The moving average (MA) is an arithmetic mean technique used to calculate the average power during a specific period. The MA model can be defined as follows: (4) MA = 1 n ( D t - 1 + D t - 2 + · · · + D t - n ) The LSTM deep learning model is a type of time-series neural network for forecasting the electricity consumption. The main parameters of the LSTM when used as one of the proposed models, or as a single benchmark model, are listed in Table 6 . The input size (width, depth) of the LSTM used in the proposed or benchmark model is (12, 5). The output shape has one dimension and the output size is 6. The hyperparameters are as shown in Table 6. The input shape of another single benchmark LSTM model is (6, 5) without the temperature input. The output size is 6. The input shape of benchmark multi-layered perceptron (MLP) model is (6, 5) and the output size is 6. Algorithm 1 Hybrid model algorithm 1: Electricity power dataset: Date ( 1 . . n ) , P ( 0 . . 23 ) 2: CSI dataset: Date ( 1 . . n ) , CSI ( 0 . . 23 ) 3: MDD dataset: Date ( 1 . . n ) , MDD ( 1 . . 6 ) 4: n ← The last number field of the datasets 5: Mean i ← Calculate the arithmetic mean power during the last two weeks 6: LSTM _ out ← The output of LSTM 7: function previous_day() ▷ Previous-day-based 8: if The prediction day is Date i then 9: Apply MDD dataset Date ( i - 1 ) , MDD ( 1 . . 6 ) to the MDD pattern of prediction day 10: end if 11: end function 12: function moving_average() ▷ Moving average 13: if The prediction day is Date i then 14: Calculate CSI dataset using Mean i 15: Extract MDD dataset Date ( i ) , MDD ( 1 . . 6 ) from the CSI dataset Date ( i ) , CSI ( 0 . . 23 ) 16: end if 17: end function 18: function lstm() ▷ LSTM 19: if The prediction day is Date i 20: Date ( i ) , CSI ( 0 . . 23 ) ← LSTM _ out 21: Extract MDD dataset Date ( i ) , MDD ( 1 . . 6 ) from the CSI dataset Date ( i ) , CSI ( 0 . . 23 ) 22: end if 23: end function 24: function combination() ▷ Combination 25: if The prediction day is Date i then 26: Execute OR logical combination of three output MDD datasets of previous-day-based method, moving average, and LSTM 27: Extract final MDD Date ( i ) , MDD ( 1 . . 6 ) 28: end if 29: end function Algorithm 1 describes the operation of the hybrid model. In the previous-day-based model, the algorithm applies the MDD dataset of the previous day to the forecasting results. In the MA, the first step is to calculate the arithmetic mean power during the last 2 weeks from the original electricity dataset. The second step is then to calculate the CSI dataset using the arithmetic mean, and the final step is to extract the MDD dataset from the CSI dataset. In the LSTM deep learning model, the MDD output is extracted from the CSI output of the LSTM. In the final combination module, the algorithm executes an OR logical combination of three MDD outputs extracted from the three models: the previous-day-based model, moving average, and LSTM model. The logical process used to combine the results of three forecasting models can allow the proposed model to address changeable and unpredictable building electricity consumption as a robust forecasting model. In addition, it can provide an improved forecasting performance over single deep learning models. 3.3 Performance metric The goal of the proposed model is to accurately forecast the MDD each day using the proposed forecasting model. There are six maximum demand zones in the KEPCO TOU each day. The values of the MDD consist of 1 s or 0 s. Therefore, a confusion matrix can generally be applied to the performance metric for addressing the binary classification. The MDD confusion matrix is shown in Table 7 . In this study, we set the performance index to prefer a high rate of MDD detections over the hit rate of the precise MDD detections. Therefore, we set the recall and accuracy as an important index within a certain range of precision. The performance metric is as follows: \u2022 True Positive (TP): The MDD value is also 1 when the model forecasts 1. \u2022 True Negative (TN): The MDD value is 0 when the model forecasts 0. \u2022 False Positive (FP): The MDD value is also 0 when the model forecasts 1. \u2022 False Negative (FN): The MDD value is 1 when the model forecasts 0. The three performance evaluation indexes are introduced as follows: (5) Precision = TP TP + FP (6) Recall = TP TP + FN (7) Accuracy = TP + TN TP + TN + FP + FN 3.4 Operating algorithm The final forecast results extracted from the proposed hybrid model can be utilized as an ESS operating scheduling. Algorithm 2 describes the operating algorithm of the utility electricity, solar energy, and ESS operating scheduling in accordance with final forecast results extracted from the hybrid model. Algorithm 2 Operating algorithm 1: Final forecast MDD dataset: Date ( i ) , MDD ( 1 . . 6 ) 2: ESS ← ESS charging capacity 3: Consumption ← Electricity consumption per hour 4: Solar _ energy ← The electricity generated from solar energy 5: Under _ limit ← The minimum charging of ESS 6: Upper _ limit ← The maximum charging of ESS 7: At the maximum demand zone of KEPCO TOU 8: while k ⩽ 6 do ▷ Maximum of 6 MDDs each day 9: if MDD k = 1 then 10: if Solar _ energy is available then 11: Use solar energy 12: else 13: if ESS ⩾ Consumption then 14: Use ESS electricity 15: ESS ← ESS - Consumption 16: else 17: Use electricity from the utility company 18: end if 19: end if 20: else 21: if Solar _ energy is available then 22: Use solar energy 23: else 24: Use electricity from the utility company 25: end if 26: end if 27: k ← k + 1 28: end while 29: At the off-peak time (within the low demand zone of the TOU) 30: if Under _ limit ⩾ ESS then 31: ESS charging to Upper _ limit 32: end if The ESS charging/discharging scheduling is based on the ESS operating strategies in [31\u201333]. In [32], the authors reported peak load shaving strategies in which the ESS is required to discharge when the peak demand is high, whereas the ESS is required to charge when the peak demand is low. When the strategies are applied to our ESS operating scheduling, the ESS is required to discharge when the forecast MDD results is 1, which indicates CSI ⩾ 80 % , whereas the ESS does not activate when the forecast MDD results is 0. At first, the algorithm identifies the MDD value of each maximum demand zone among the six maximum demand zones of the KEPCO TOU each day. If the MDD value is 1, the building uses solar energy if available. However, if there is insufficient solar energy to provide electricity to the building, the building can use ESS electricity alternatively. In addition, if there is insufficient solar energy or ESS electricity to provide the building electricity, the building finally uses the electricity from the utility company. In other words, solar energy has a high priority in providing electricity because it is the cheapest among the three resources regarding the electricity price. The utility electricity has a low priority because the electricity price of the utility company is the most expensive within the maximum demand zone of the TOU. When the algorithm identifies an MDD value of 0, it means the demand zone is not the peak demand within the maximum demand zone of the KEPCO TOU. Thus, the algorithm does not use ESS electricity. At this time, if solar energy is available, the building uses solar energy. If there is insufficient solar energy to provide the building electricity, the building finally uses the electricity from the utility company. At the off-peak time, if the ESS charging state is under the limit, the ESS will charge to the upper limit. Fig. 6 describes the power flow concept of the grid, solar energy, and ESS for optimization model. The objective function and the constraints of operating algorithm are set up using the optimization model in [31] as follows: (8) minimize : P g n = ∑ h = 0 23 ( P l h - P o h ) Δ t (9) subjectto : P l n = P o n + P g n , (10) P o n = P d n + P s n , (11) P l , P o , P g , P s , P d , P c ⩾ 0 , (12) E b min ⩽ ∑ h = 0 n P b h Δ t + E 0 ⩽ E b max , (13) P b min ⩽ P b n ⩽ P b max . In Eqs. (8)\u2013(13), E and P are electricity energy and power, respectively. Subscript g refers to the utility grid power, subscript l is the electricity load power for the building, subscript s denotes solar energy power output, subscript o refers to the power flows from ESS and solar energy, subscript c is the ESS charging power from main grid, subscript d indicates the ESS discharging power when MDD forecast result is 1, and superscript n denotes the current timestep. In the ESS, E 0 is the initial condition, E b is the ESS energy, and P b is the ESS power. Eq. (8) minimizes the utility electricity for 24 h each day with one hour sampling rate (i.e., the electricity load power minus the output power from ESS and solar energy). Eq. (9) means the building uses the electricity from the utility company, ESS, and solar energy. Eq. (10) is the electricity output power from ESS and solar energy. Eq. (11) denotes the condition (electricity power variables ⩾ 0 ). In Eqs. (12)\u2013(13), the ESS constraints are set up. Eq. (12) denotes the rated capacity of ESS, the lower and upper limit of ESS. Eq. (13) indicates the ESS charging/discharging electricity power, and the lower and upper limit of the power conversion system (PCS) power. 4 The experimental results In this experimental section, we describe two experiments. The first is to examine the forecasting ability of the proposed hybrid model compared to the other benchmark models. The second is to examine the ability to reduce the peak demand costs based on the TOU using the forecasting results of the proposed model and the operating algorithm. 4.1 Forecasting ability of the proposed model We examine the forecasting ability of the proposed model compared with the other benchmark models: single previous-day-based model, single moving average model, single LSTM model using the temperature dataset, single LSTM model, and single MLP model.Table 8 shows the experimental results of the proposed and other benchmark models using test dataset, which consists of previously unseen data. As the performance index, the proposed model shows a recall of 91.01%, accuracy of 78.04%, and precision of 55.39%. The proposed model provides the highest recall (91.01%) among all other models. For the arithmetic mean of the recall and accuracy, the proposed model also obtains the highest score (84.53%). The single previous-day-based model, single moving average model, and single LSTM model using the temperature dataset obtained scores of between 70% and 80% for the arithmetic mean of the recall and accuracy, whereas the single MLP model obtained the lowest score (36.54%). As the experimental results indicate, the proposed hybrid model can be a robust approach against previously unseen data based on the high recall and accuracy scores as compared to the other models. Regarding to the forecasting effects of the actual temperature data, we could identify the effects of the proposed model when the actual temperature data is applied to the model as an additional input as shown in Table 8. As shown in Table 8, the LSTM model is a forecasting model without the actual temperature input data, whereas the LSTM (with temperature) model is a forecasting model using the actual temperature input data. The forecast results of LSTM (with temperature) show the better performance (the arithmetic mean of recall and accuracy, 76.32%) than LSTM model (63.31%). It means that the actual temperature input data has the effects to improve the forecast performance. Therefore, the proposed hybrid model architecture has incorporated three models: previous-day-based model, moving average (MA), and LSTM (with temperature) model. 4.2 Shaved peak demand costs based on TOU To identify the reduced peak demand costs based on the TOU, we specify the ESS conditions. Table 9 shows the ESS specifications used in the experiment. It is assumed that 1,000 kWh ESS is connected with a 1,000 kW power conversion system (PCS), the ESS operates between the lower limit (10%) and upper limit (90%), and the ESS charges a full capacity of 800 kWh during the off-peak time. Fig. 7 describes the experimental process of identifying the reduced peak demand costs based on the TOU compared with the case in which the proposed algorithm is not applied. However, solar energy is available in any case regardless of the proposed algorithm. As shown in Fig. 7, utility electricity is utilized in all zones of the MDD table when the proposed algorithm is not applied. In the proposed algorithm, the ESS operating scheduling is in accordance with the forecast results of the proposed method. At the maximum demand zone of the KEPCO TOU, the ESS is required to discharge when the forecast MDD result is 1, which means CSI ⩾ 80 % , whereas the ESS does not activate when the forecast MDD result is 0. Therefore, the proposed algorithm uses ESS electricity when the MDD forecast result is 1 in each zone, whereas utility electricity is utilized otherwise (=0). The experiment on the shaved peak demand costs based on the TOU is executed using the comparison results between three results and actual MDD results based on the test dataset (August 23, 2017 to August 2, 2018). When MDD forecast result is 1, actual MDD at the maximum demand zone of KEPCO TOU and forecast MDD are equal in each zone, peak demand costs are calculated using the electricity costs in the time zone of low load. On the other hand, when they are not equal, the peak demand costs are calculated using the electricity costs in the time zone of maximum load. Table 10 shows the experimental results of the peak demand costs and rate of reduction using the proposed model and algorithm. As shown in Table 10, the peak demand costs without the model and algorithm is 35,120,271 KRW, whereas the total costs with the proposed model and the operating algorithm is 27,517,151 KRW, which means the proposed method is expected to reduce the peak demand costs by 22%. We analyze the electricity consumption patterns to identify the effectiveness of the proposed method for the target building. At first, the electricity consumption one day pattern (Aug. 24, 2017) for the building is shown in Fig. 8 . As shown in Fig. 8, there are two electricity consumption graphs: total electricity consumption (solid line) and shaved electricity consumption (dashed line). The office building uses the electricity during typical office hours (8 am to 6 pm). Regarding to the shaved electricity consumption, it is observed that the proposed model and the operating algorithm reduced the electricity consumption during the office hours using the operating algorithm of the utility electricity, solar energy, and ESS operating scheduling in accordance with final forecast results extracted from the hybrid model. Fig. 9 shows the comparison results between electricity consumption without the proposed method (solid line) and electricity consumption with the proposed method (dashed line) each day from August 23, 2017 to August 2, 2018. This result also indicates that the proposed model and algorithm reduced the electricity consumption during that period, and we identified the synergic effects of the proposed model and the operating algorithm to realize the shaved peak demand costs based on TOU for a reduction in building electricity use. 5 Discussion As the first advantage, the proposed model and algorithm can offer an efficient method to shave the peak demand costs based on the TOU for a building energy operator. The experiment results for the reduced peak demand costs based on the TOU showed a 22% reduction in costs. As the second advantage, the proposed method can contribute to grid stability by reducing the peak demand costs within the maximum demand zone of the TOU. Fig. 10 illustrates a grid example in which a group of buildings and residential homes are connected with the main grid. When the proposed method is assumed to be applied to a group of buildings equipped with an ESS and solar energy, and when the method operates well within all buildings, each building can reduce its peak demand costs by reducing its own peak demand within the maximum demand zone of the TOU. The aggregate reduced peak demand within the maximum demand zone of the TOU can improve the grid stability because each building has its own peak demand pattern. The third advantage is to provide efficient demand response (DR) programs for the DR operator. DR programs have been studied for [34\u201336] a power grid. Incorporating the proposed method will allow the DR operator to provide such a program efficiently. The DR operator can determine the electricity price based on the aggregate forecasting results of the proposed model. When the aggregate forecasting results indicate a high peak demand within the maximum demand zone of the TOU, the DR operator will provide a higher electricity price than before to the electricity consumers, whereas the DR operator will provide a lower price when the aggregate forecasting results show a low peak demand at the maximum demand zone of the TOU. A summary of the main contributions of the proposed method is as follows: \u2022 The proposed model and operating algorithm showed the quantitative results of an experiment on shaving the peak demand costs within the maximum demand zone at the TOU for a reduction in building electricity use. \u2022 The proposed model showed an improved forecasting ability including the highest recall (91.01%) among other benchmark models when using previously unseen test data. \u2022 The operating algorithm can provide the shaved peak demand costs (22% reduction in costs) based on the scheduling of solar energy, utility electricity, and ESS in accordance with the predicted results of the proposed forecasting model based on KEPCO TOU. \u2022 The proposed model can contribute to a reduction in the generalization errors based on an improved forecasting ability. \u2022 The proposed model can be a robust way to address a changeable and unpredictable building electricity consumption when using a hybrid approach incorporating three types of models: the previous-day-based model, the moving average using the last 2 weeks, and an LSTM deep learning model using the previous 5 days. 6 Conclusion In this paper, we proposed an efficient data-driven hybrid forecasting model and an operation algorithm to reduce the peak demand costs based on the time of use (TOU) for decreasing electricity costs in a building. The proposed hybrid model and algorithm are expected to reduce the peak demand costs by 22% based on the TOU compared to a case in which the proposed model and operating algorithm are not applied. The peak demand cost without the model and algorithm was 35,120,271 KRW, whereas the total cost with the proposed model and operating algorithm was 27,517,151 KRW. The experimental results of the forecasting ability indicate that the proposed hybrid model can reduce the generalization error based on a highest recall of 91.01% when compared with other benchmark models using a previously unseen test dataset. In addition, the proposed method can potentially improve the grid stability, and the method can be more effective when incorporating a DR program. To bridge the gap between real situation and experimental verification in real power grid, there is a need to further develop the improved model and algorithm for real power grid stability. In the future work, we will investigate the improved method to realize the shaved peak demand costs based on TOU for a reduction in building electricity use in real power grid.

        "dc:description": "Forecasting technologies aiming to reduce building electricity consumption and costs have recently been developed. However, to design a more accurate forecasting model using a physical-based approach, complicated mathematical modeling and multi-variable parameters and constraints must be considered. Moreover, single data-driven models usually have a high generalization error regarding previously unseen data. Most hybrid forecasting models usually do not consider shaving the peak demand costs based on time of use (TOU) to save building electricity costs. To overcome this limitation, we propose a data-driven hybrid forecasting model and an operating algorithm to shave the peak demand costs based on the TOU. The proposed model and algorithm are expected to reduce peak demand costs by 22%. In addition, the experimental results indicate that the hybrid model can reduce generalization errors because it improves the forecasting performance, achieving the highest recall (91.01%) among other models using a previously unseen test dataset.",
