Thermal energy dynamics of a large building can be turned up as a substantial source of ancillary service for the grid. This paper presents that how the potential of Air Handling Unit (AHU) of Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system can be utilized as a virtual source of an ancillary service by regulating it in real time according to its thermal load. Internet of Things (IoT) enabled real time controller is proposed where the thermal comfort of occupants is used as feedback to control the AHU fans. The key challenge corresponding to the AHU is, nonlinear torque characteristics of fan with respect to required air flow rate at a thermal load on AHU. To address this problem an Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System is used to model the nonlinear property of the AHU fan. In this system it has two-part integration, IoT based controller and ANFIS based model with thermal model of building. To evaluate the algorithm, first, the reserved ancillary potential is calculated based on weekly class schedule. Secondly, it has been controlled in real time as per the thermal comfort of occupants to maximize the potential of ancillary service through the HVAC system. To analyze the response of the algorithm for a building, this set-up is scaled up at the level of AHU network installed in the lecture hall complex of an educational building in Delhi. The proposed algorithm has been tested and analyzed on an experimental set-up, synchronized with the thermal-dynamic model of building in MATLAB. It shows that there is a potential of ancillary service up to 97 kW in non-scheduled period and for the scheduled period it can be increased by 20% to 59% of available reserve power. Keywords Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System Internet of Things Ancillary services 1 Introduction 1.1 Related work Now a days, many of the educational buildings has been converted into multistory buildings having facility of central cooling system. Depending on the size of building power rating of Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) unit varies from some kW to MW. These high-power rating cooling systems can be used as a secondary source to provide ancillary service. A study [1], shows that the ancillary services provided by HVAC can be used as frequency regulation, load flow control, spinning reserve etc. which increase the reliability of the grid. Certain market based ancillary service provision, supported by HVAC units has been developed, where the cost for this service play a major role. Recent research works in this field include [2\u20135]. The author in [2] presents that the marginal opportunity cost vary with time and proper adjustment of load in a time interval can reduce the opportunity cost against the ancillary service. In [3], a secondary market is developed to provide ancillary service by demand load to operate in day ahead market by using distributed generation and local intelligence. An hourly market is adjusted by the existing resources available at the demand side. Ancillary power delivery cost is evaluated with the comparison of energy consumption which is provided by demand response [4]. In [5], a flexible bidding is proposed for ancillary service market when power is supplied by building. It also studied the economic sensitivity against the electricity price. For the controlling of HVAC unit, if we are following the switch on/off strategy, there is a lot of I2R loss of unit and scheduling of these units are comparatively efficient than continuous on/off strategy. A continuous operation of HVAC unit at its less capacity is more efficient than others, for continuous operation and thermal comfort of building\u2019s occupant it is quite necessary to have an accurate estimation of thermal load of the building. The authors in [6,7] proposed a hierarchical controlling algorithm for HVAC system. They use robust optimization to schedule the reserve power while robust model predictive control algorithm is used to be remain the room temperature maintained at a set point. They compute the capacity of reserve power for day ahead with assumption of different conditions. Further, fan speed is also controlled with the reference of regD signal and satisfying the thermal load by using model predictive control. In [8], the author proposed a hierarchy-based controller. It ensures the thermal comfort of conditioned zone and flexibility of grid by using robust optimization algorithm. A feed-forward architecture is also proposed to regulate the power consumption by fan in [9]. Existing literature shows that many optimization algorithms are useful for the optimum controlling of HVAC system [10\u201315]. The author in [10] applied a stochastic and robust optimization algorithm to formulate the reserve scheduling while the set point of HVAC is calculated by using Model Predictive Control (MPC) method. Again, a Stochastic Model Predictive Control (SMPC) is formulated for large scale system in [11]. It combines the feedback of disturbance and robust control algorithm. The author in [12] considered a shopping center as a pilot project and the thermal energy is being controlled for this building using MPC. In [13], a method is proposed to learn the thermal load of building which could be deployed for the cost-effective predictive control. Instead of this, a kalman filter is also used to estimate different parameters and to predict the thermal response of a zone. Thermal load of building is computed by using mathematical model of room temperature and number of occupants. A control strategy is also proposed for the temperature regulation based on MPC in [14]. In [15], author estimated the capability of frequency regulation provided by a commercial building. It proposed an MPC based algorithm where different type of revenues is taken care. MPC based thermal model has been implemented to operate the HVAC system in a building with the facility of online learning of thermal preferences in [16]. It also tries to decrease the dissatisfaction level of occupants by controlling the MPC model with the help of self-tuning function of system. The author in [17], have been derived a data driven occupant\u2019s thermal sensation model to design the two different MPC. This design has used to minimize the energy consumption of HVAC unit within the constraint of thermal comfort level. As per the literature, dynamics of thermal response of building is nonlinear in nature [18\u201322]. The author in [18], formulate a nonlinear model of thermal zone with the foretasted uncertain load supported by the probability density functions. Problem related with temperature control of building is treated as a dynamic allocation of resources in [19]. This problem is approached with the population dynamics including a model of non-linear control system to regulate the temperature. A non-linear controller is proposed in [20] for the control of HVAC system considering the time dependent thermal load. This controller works on the basic of Lyapunov Stability theory to reject the disturbances. A decentralized nonlinear adaptive controller is also proposed in [21] which consists of one inner loop and one outer loop. Inner loop includes the fuzzy logic controller as feedback controller to minimize the disturbances while the outer loop is based on Fourier Integral method. Author in [22] proposed a Multiple Input Multiple Output based robust controller to improve the performance of HVAC system. The result of this proposed scheme is compared with the Single Input Single Output based controlling topology. Some research work has been done recently for the energy management in building using smart devices like Internet of Things (IoT). An optimum energy management for building is proposed in [23] with the help of historical data. For the collection of data, it captured the building\u2019s physical parameters generated on energy plus software and estimated by using least square estimation method. In paper [24], a data driven, IoT based framework for the pre-cooling of building is proposed. Through this proposed system author reduce the peak load and electricity cost as well. HVAC system has been controlled as per the events occurring in the thermal zone in [25\u201327]. Refs. of [25\u201327] classified the events in two group, one is local and another one is global. For the optimal control, it captures the information considering a virtual test bed for small events in [25], further, in [26] an approximated solution is given focusing on local event-based policies. The author in [27], proposed a real time adaptive critic controller to achieve the comfort temperature which is triggered based on events occurring in room. It consists two phases, in first phase it generates the control action following the linear quadratic regulator with the training of actor-critic network. In second phase the adaptive controller takes decision over first one. Literature shows that the artificial intelligence also has played role in controlling of HVAC system [28\u201333]. The author in [28] proposed a Robust Neural Network (RNN) based controller with IoT for the training of network. By using RNN occupancy inside the room is estimated which is helpful for the calculation of set point for HVAC system. An intelligent controller has been integrated with IoT [29]. RNN is used for the occupancy estimation which is being solved by the inverse relation of Predictive Mean Vote set point of temperature for HVAC system. In paper [30], comparisons among the controllers based on RNN, MPC and artificial intelligence are discussed. It is found that RNN is better than others. RNN based controller estimate the occupancy according to the sensors data installed in HVAC duct. For the training of this neutral network Partial Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Sequential Quadratic Programming is used. In [31], a cascaded control strategy is proposed for the AHU control based on neutral network and compared with PID based controller. The multi-layer network is trained by using Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation training algorithm. A wireless network of sensors is presented in [32] by applying Predictive Mean Vote (PMV) as a thermal comfort index of occupants. Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and PSO are being used to solve the non-linear and inverse PMV model to find the comfort temperature. In [33], the author used the artificial neural network (ANN) to optimize the temperature of supply air from AHU which finally reduces the requirement of cooling energy. By applying different control strategies, the power consumption of HVAC system has been reduced. The saved power is considerable to provide the ancillary services. The author in [34], investigate the potential of HVAC system to provide ancillary power for intra-hour load. Considering several buildings some results are simulated which shows that a building cluster may provide up to ±1 MW of power with the direct control of HVAC unit. In [35], the flexibility of ramping rate of Air conditioning load is studied. Outcome of this study shows that the residential HVAC system can provide considerable regulating power within low frequent requirement. A two-layer control architecture for HVAC is proposed in [36]. In first layer, it schedules the baseline power for ancillary service and in second layer it updates the ancillary power ensuring the indoor air temperature in comfort range. In [37], a control framework has been developed for the scheduling of frequency reserve aggregated from commercial building. To calculate the reserve capacity robust optimization is used while robust MPC based controller is used to optimize the HVAC power consumption. It shows that the cluster of 100 buildings can provide a minimum 5 MW of bid size in Swiss market. 1.2 Research gap and motivation As per rigorous literature survey, it is found that, to provide the ancillary service through HVAC system mostly cost related issues are presented. To provide ancillary power, the HVAC load is controlled keeping in mind the optimal operating cost of system. While in case of building, the thermal comfort of occupants plays a major role in controlling of HVAC load. Therefore, for the ancillary power, provided by HVAC system, thermal comfort feedback of occupants should be considered. It has been analyzed that an educational building having a HVAC unit, have enormous potential of ancillary service. Therefore, in this paper Lecture Hall Complex (LHC) in Delhi has been considered where, the HVAC unit installed is of power capacity around 1 MW. For the provision of ancillary services, Air Handling Unit (AHU) network of this HVAC unit has been considered which have 40 AHUs of different rating. An experimental set-up is presented for mimicking of the AHU in real time against the inputs from different sensor nodes, number of occupants data as output of image processing and feedback of comfort temperature by occupants over cloud on TCP/IP protocol followed by scheduling of AHU network according to the time table of classrooms. The major contributions of this paper are encapsulated as: \u2022 A novel operational frame has been developed for maximizing the ancillary power capacity of an educational building. \u2022 The nonlinear relation between load torque on AHU fan and air flow rate has been linearized by using ANFIS which decide the speed of the fan as per the thermal load. \u2022 IoT enabled remote controller for an AHU system has been demonstrated in real time. It considers the building thermal dynamics and feedback of the occupants as an input to the system. 1.3 Organization of paper In this paper, Section 2 contains the modeling of systems used while Section 3 explains the function of proposed controlling scheme. Description of proposed system is in Section 4 followed by the results analysis in Sections 5 and 6 concluded this paper. 2 System modeling 2.1 R-C model of thermal zone A model for a thermal zone as a network of thermal-resistance and thermal-capacitance connected in series and parallel combinations according to the wall, window and door position of a particular room has been developed. Fig. 1 presents the thermal model of a classroom of considered building in Delhi. It includes the effect of solar radiation, cooling power supplied by HVAC system QHV AC, internal thermal load generated by electrical equipment, lighting load and occupancy level QINT. Here, Tr denotes the room temperature while Cr and Rin present thermal-capacitance of air mass and thermal-resistance of air inside the room respectively while Tw denotes the wall temperature. Thermal resistance (R) and thermal capacitance (C) can be calculated from the following equation: (1) C = ρ ∗ V ∗ c p (2) R = L / k ∗ A where, ρ is density of material used, V is volume, cp is specific heat capacity at constant pressure, L is length, A is surface area and k is thermal conductivity of material. The values of ρ and k is obtained from [38]. To get the dynamics of temperature variation inside the room, the thermal system is assumed as an electrical network where, Tr, Cr and Rin presents the voltage, capacitance and resistance of network respectively. Therefore, here by applying Kirchoff Current Law on the center node of the network, first order differential equation is found as an Eqs. (3) and (4) is the solution of Eq. (3) in term of time as mentioned below: (3) C r d T r / d t = ∑ j = 1 n [ ( T wj - T r ) / ( C r ( R in + R wj / 2 ) ) ] + Q INT - Q HVAC (4) T r t = T r 0 e - A t + T w t 1 - e - A t + ( Q INT ( t ) - Q HVAC ( t ) ) / A ∗ 1 - e - A t (5) A = ∑ i = 1 n a i (6) a i = 1 / ( C r ( R in + R w / 2 ) ) i where, n is the number of nodes coming to the center of room. From simulation result of this thermal zone in MATLAB, the thermal response time of the building can be calculated. The calculated response time of building is around 1000 s (16.7 min) to set the room temperature at a particular set point. Thermal properties of the building parts used in the simulation are listed in Table 1 while the thermal response of the building is presented in Fig. 2 . 1) Verification of Model: Verification of the simulated building in MATLAB has been done on Energy Plus platform. The parameters considered for this model are listed in Table 2 and the response of the system is shown in Fig. 3 . As per Fig. 3 the time response of the building is around 17 min which is very close to MATLAB model result. 2.2 Fan modelling To include the fan load of AHU in simulation, a steady state model of fan is designed. This fan model helps to find out the power consumption as well as the reserve power capacity of system for a thermal load requirement of zone. According to the fan law, power consumption of fan is proportional to the cubic of fan speed (N) and N is proportional to frequency (f). As per [6], power consumed by fan can be formulated in terms of N as expressed in Eq. (7). (7) P fan = a N 3 + b N 2 + c N + d The supplied air flow rate (v) is directly proportional to N, therefore, a steady state model of fan can be represented by the following equations: (8) P fan = a 1 f 3 + a 2 f 2 + a 3 f + a 4 (9) P fan = b 1 v 3 + b 2 v 2 + b 3 v + b 4 (10) v = c 1 f + c 22 where, Pfan is power consumed by the fan. To find out the coefficient value of these equations, operating frequency of the fan is being varied from 10 Hz to 50 Hz with the interval of 5 Hz and power consumed by the fan is measured. Apart from this the air flow rate is also measured with respect to the operating frequency of fan. Calculated values of coefficients are given in Table 3 , while the measured data and identified model is presented in Figs. 4 and 5 . It can be observed from the Figs. 4 and 5 that the curve fitting performance is good with the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) value of 0.008598 and 0.01874 respectively. 2.3 Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System An adaptive learning mechanism is quite similar to Neural Network (NN). An adaptive learning method provides a scheme to fuzzy model to acquire the statistics of set of data. The parameters of membership function are being computed by fuzzy logic toolbox allowing the linked Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) to follow the input and output set of data. The function of fuzzy logic toolbox that achieves the adjustment of function is termed as Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS). In case of a system modeling or inclusion of a control logic in a system if fuzzy logic has to be used and there is some data set about the system, ANFIS can be useful here. By using an available data set of input/output, ANFIS creates a FIS, parameters of membership function of constructed FIS are being regulated by hybrid method that is combination of least square and Back Propagation Algorithm (BPA). ANFIS and neuro fuzzy designer apply fuzzy inference technique to data modeling as per [39,40]. In AHU fan, the flow rate of the cooled air depends on the required cooling load and the speed of fan can be defined in terms of the air flow rate as well as torque on the motor. Air friction on the fan depend on the size of fan, air volume and speed of fan. When the speed of fan varies the friction on the torque vary due to which the torque on the motor vary. Therefore, it is very complex to find the load torque and required fan speed as per the cooling load. Here, ANFIS is being used for learning of torque data against the air flow rate required. Total 46 sets of experimental data are used to train the network with the root mean square error for the training only 0.02484 as shown in Fig. 6 . As the time goes, more practical data can be fetched, which will be according to the thermal comfort of occupants and this data can be used to train the ANFIS. More will be the number of training data less will be the error, and this is the advantage of this system that the controller error can be minimized as the number of training data increases. The main advantage of the ANFIS is the application of artificial intelligence with the fuzzy system and its capability of adaptation. 3 Function of proposed controlling scheme 3.1 TCP/IP communication TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/ Internet Protocol) is the language in which internet communicates. It is a two layered protocol containing some set of rules. The upper layer is TCP layer responsible for converting larger amount of data in the form of deliverable packets and lower layer IP layer is responsible for routing these packets to right destination. TCP/IP functionality is divided into 4 layers i.e. Link layer (bottom layer), Internet layer, Transport layer and Application Layer (Top layer). While routing the packet, every computer on network checks the IP address to forward it to right device. It provides with reliable or connection-oriented transmission with features like error-checking, flow control and packet acknowledgement etc. TCP/IP packet formats are shown in Fig. 7 . 3.2 Occupancy estimation Occupancy estimation, inside a room with high accuracy plays an important role to calculate the real time thermal load of a room through which we can increase the energy efficiency of the HVAC system. In this proposed system we are following image processing technique, which detects the face profile of the occupants inside the room facing towards camera. This image processing technique follow the Haar-cascade algorithm for face recognition. Fig. 8 shows the experimental setup for occupancy estimation and performance of the Haar-Cascade algorithm. Sometime there is an error in face recognition as shown in Fig. 8, still this error does not affect more in the calculation of thermal load because the frequency to capture these is per 5 s and thermal load calculation is in one-minute time interval. 3.3 Occupants feedback system For the feedback of thermal comfort an android application is developed, which can be easily installed in occupants\u2019 mobile phone. This application is built using MIT App Inventor tool which allows creative app designs according to requirements. In this work, an app is built with seven different temperatures of operation as shown in the Fig. 9 from 20 °C to 26 °C. Here, user is asked to enter his/her name, then pick the present thermal zone and choose desired Temperature as mentioned above. The feedback data is fed into Google cloud named as\u201d Firebase\u201d and from Firebase it will be transferred to Thingspeak by using TCP/IP protocol over Wi-Fi. 4 Description of proposed system 4.1 Overall system To have an optimal amount of reserve power for the provision of ancillary services, a specific system is being proposed as shown in Fig. 10 . In this system, there are three levels for ensuring of the optimal reserve power. In level 1, the system will obtain the classroom schedule from the Building Management System (BMS) of a day. It calculates the reserve power available and time period according to the classroom schedule. In level 2, the room temperature will be controlled according to the thermal comfort of the occupants inside the room by controlling the fan speed of Air Handling Unit (AHU). To control the fan speed, the system obtains the different information from inputs like outdoor weather condition, occupancy data, indoor air quality and occupants\u2019 feedback. The outdoor weather condition is fetched from website (accuweather.com) and feed it to Thingspeak (MATLAB cloud). For the indoor condition, multiple sensors are installed like CO2 sensor, temperature sensor and humidity sensor. Output of these sensors are being logged in a data logger and transferred to the Thingspeak. Estimated occupancy through image processing as well as feedback of the occupants for thermal comfort are also being uploaded to Thingspeak. All these inputs are transferred to MATLAB cloud on Wi-Fi communication. Real time estimation of occupancy is useful for the thermal load calculation of the building. Occupants inside the room can give the feedback of their thermal comfort which is also a significant information for the thermal load estimation. Therefore, based on all above information the system takes decision about the required air flow rate from AHU and the speed of AHU fan, to control the zone temperature. For the controlling of AHU fan, an ANFIS based controller is designed in MATLAB which decides the speed of fan based on the historical data. Thus, apart from full speed of AHU fan, now it will run at a variable speed depending on the thermal load. In level 3, all the information about power consumption of AHU from level 1 and level 2 is being collected. According to this, the power reserved for the ancillary services is being maximized. 4.2 Reserve Scheduling according to classroom schedule According to the timetable of the classrooms connected to AHUs, reserve power for the ancillary service which can be provided is scheduled for the weekdays. The ancillary service potential from different size of room like 500, 300, and 150 capacity of occupants for 24 h of weekday is shown in Fig. 11 . In Fig. 11 there are five part which represent the data for Monday to Friday. As a result of building thermal dynamics it takes around 15\u201317 min to set the room temperature accordingly. Therefore, the AHUs are kept switched on 15 min before the classroom schedule and switched off, if there are no two or more continuous classes. In considered building, AHUs network of HVAC system has various capacity of AHU connected to different size of room such as 500, 300 and 150 student\u2019s capacity. In some case one room is connected to one AHU while in some case one room is connected to two AHU and vice-versa. Electrical power capacity of connected AHUs is 7.5 kW, 5.5 kW and 2.2 kW while the total power rating of AHU network is 97 kW. Number of AHUs connected to all the rooms is shown in Fig. 12 . 4.3 Controlling of AHU The schematic of controlling scheme for the fan of AHU is represented in Fig. 13 . It includes all the inputs to system like occupancy estimation, feedback data, air quality information, connectivity over cloud and output terminal end at the Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) of AHU fan. 1) Thermal Load Calculation: Indoor thermal load of the building basically depends on the number of occupants, artificial light source, and electric appliances. Outdoor Thermal load depend on the ambient condition which vary the wall temperature. Indoor heat generated and HVAC cooling power required for the thermal comfort temperature, fed by the occupants can be expressed as in Eqs. (11) and (12), where Tr is the present time room temperature, ma is mass flow rate of air, Cp specific heat coefficient at constant pressure and Tset is the average value of feedback temperature by occupants. (11) Q ̇ indoor = Q ̇ occupants + Q ̇ lights + Q ̇ equipments (12) Q ̇ HVAC , r e q u i r e d = m ̇ a c p ( T r - T set ) (13) T set = ∑ i = n T i / n 2) Calculations for AHU: To fulfill the real time estimated thermal load, it is necessary to calculate the air flow rate supplied by the AHU fan and accordingly the speed of motor of AHU. So, the expression for the air flow rate and the speed of motor is mentioned below. where, Tset,air is the temperature of supplied chilled air, Nr is speed of motor in RPM, ηm is motor efficiency, and τ is torque of motor while SP, SE are static air pressure and static fan efficiency respectively. (14) V ̇ sup m 3 / s = 0.472 ∗ Q ̇ HVAC , r e q u i r e d 273 + T set , a i r 10 - 3 (15) V ̇ sup CFM = V ̇ sup m 3 / s / 2118.88 (16) N r = ( V ̇ sup C F M ∗ 5252 ∗ S P ) / ( 6356 ∗ S E ∗ η m ∗ τ ) 4.4 Hardware set-up To check the response of the proposed system, an experimental set up is installed in lab which can be explained in Fig. 14 . For the measurement of Indoor ambient condition two sensor has been installed, one of them measures the CO2 level while another measures the temperature as well as relative humidity level. These measured data are logged in a data logger and transferred to Thingspeak over Wi-Fi communication for the input to system. Another input through camera, for occupancy estimation image processing is done following the haar-cascade algorithm on raspberry-pi board. Feedback of occupants is also considered as an input and this feedback is being uploaded by occupants on firebase cloud using the mobile application. All these inputs are communicated over TCP/IP protocol and being uploaded on Thingspeak. In MATLAB simulation, according to all these inputs the thermal load of room is being calculated. To compensate this thermal power, the required cooling power supplied by the AHU and fan speed of AHU is computed based on ANFIS. One Graphical User Interface (GUI) is designed for the monitoring of the operating condition of the system and all the inputs. Control signal of speed of the fan as a resultant of simulation, is transferred to a microcontroller over Wi-Fi which is connected to a voltage regulator. This voltage regulator controls the VFD externally, ultimately it controls the induction motor connected in AHU system. Experimental setup installed in lab have the capacity to supply 19 kW of cooling power with the assumption of 16 °C of cooled supply air temperature. There is some time consumption for the computation in MATLAB, and communication with cloud, therefore, the system calculates speed of fan each after 2-minute interval. 1) VFD Control System: To control VFD externally, it needs a voltage signal of 10 V to operate at 50 Hz frequency. If the voltage level of signal is less than 10 V, the frequency supplied by VFD will decrease accordingly. So, to control the VFD fan as per the thermal load requirement of room, the voltage signal has to be controlled. This control is being followed by the calculation of required thermal load of building and volumetric flow rate of air to fulfill this load, on MATLAB platform, which is transferred to ANFIS based fuzzy controller which gives the output as operating speed of AHU fan. This numeric data is transmitted over Wi-Fi on TCP/IP protocol by using a Wi-Fi enabled microcontroller, ESP8266. There is limitation of this microcontroller is that, its output voltage is only up to 3.3 V. Therefore, this output voltage signal is being amplified to get 10 V against 3.3 V and feed it to the VFD terminal for the real time controlling operation of AHU according to the required thermal load. 5 Results and discussion 5.1 Ancillary potential at normal scheduling As per timetable schedule of classes for weekdays the reserve power potential of ancillary power by considered building is shown in Fig. 15 . The total power capacity of installed AHU network in building is 97 kW. Therefore, it has maximum potential of 97 kW which is from 00:00 h to 07:45 h and 19:00 h to 24:00 h. In between these timing according to number of AHUs switched on/off, there is variation in potential of ancillary service by AHU network. 5.2 Results of experimental set-up The experimental set-up consists of an induction motor having rated power capacity of 1 HP (0.75 kW). As per the fan load, the considered motor consumes only 0.52 kW of power at 50 Hz of operating frequency. In this experiment, thermal load of building is considered as variable in the terms of occupancy and comfort room temperature. To vary the occupancy level in room, a variable gain is used with the input data of image processing. The temperature level required is obtained from cloud, which has been fed through the mobile application. The experimental result is tabulated in Tables 4\u20137 . Table 4 represent the load profile and power consumption of AHU unit when the room set temperature is 23 °C. In this table, occupancy varies from 5 to 25 number of occupants and the thermal load of building changes from 16.44 kW to 18.00 kW. To compensate this amount of thermal load the air flow required is 4752 CFM to 5203 CFM and for this the AHU consumes 0.339 kW to 0.4147 kW of power. Hence, in this case, the power reserved for the ancillary services is 0.161 kW to 0.0853 kW. In Table 5, experimental result for the 24 °C of set room temperature is presented. It shows that, if there is variation in occupancy level from 5 to 25 occupants, the thermal load changes from 15.24 kW to 16.8 kW. To meet the desired temperature the AHU fan consumes 0.29 kW to 0.3552 kW of power and capacity of the ancillary power is 0.21 kW to 0.1448 kW. Table 6 shows that, if there is occupancy variation between 5 and 25 number of occupants at 25 °C of room temperature and the thermal load changes from 14.17 kW to 15.61 kW. The required air flow rate for this amount of thermal load is 4096 CFM to 4512 CFM while to supply this amount of air the AHU consumes 0.2525 kW to 0.3045 kW of power and ancillary power reserved is 0.2475 kW to 0.1955 kW in this case. Statistics for the room temperature to be set at 26 °C against the variable number of occupants is tabulated in Table 7. Thermal load of the room changes from 12.82 kW to 14.4 kW if the occupants level changes from 5 to 25 number. The air flow rate required to compensate this thermal load is 3705 CFM to 4162 CFM and in this condition the fan of AHU consumes the power from 0.2127 kW to 0.2601 kW. Therefore, the ancillary power capacity is maximized up to 0.2873 kW to 0.2399 kW. Experimental results conclude that, instead of 0.52 kW of power consumption, AHU system is now consuming only 0.2127 kW to 0.4147 kW dependent on the set room temperature and occupancy level inside room. 6 Conclusion In this work, an ANFIS based non-linear characteristics of fan torque in the terms of air flow rate has been introduced to compensate the thermal load of conditioned zone. A real-time IoT enabled AHU control system is presented, which is linked with classroom schedule for weekdays. The result came out as a potential of ancillary services by AHU network is expressed. The reserved potential in uncontrolled or manual controlled case, has been maximized by using proposed controlling scheme. According to the inputs of ambient condition, image processing as well as occupant\u2019s feedback it is computed that the change in power consumption vary from 40.9% to 79.75% of rated. Therefore, the reserve potential can be maximized by 59.09% to 20.25%. Thus, this paper shows the potential of an educational building for the provision of ancillary services.

        "dc:description": "Thermal energy dynamics of a large building can be turned up as a substantial source of ancillary service for the grid. This paper presents that how the potential of Air Handling Unit (AHU) of Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system can be utilized as a virtual source of an ancillary service by regulating it in real time according to its thermal load. Internet of Things (IoT) enabled real time controller is proposed where the thermal comfort of occupants is used as feedback to control the AHU fans. The key challenge corresponding to the AHU is, nonlinear torque characteristics of fan with respect to required air flow rate at a thermal load on AHU. To address this problem an Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System is used to model the nonlinear property of the AHU fan. In this system it has two-part integration, IoT based controller and ANFIS based model with thermal model of building. To evaluate the algorithm, first, the reserved ancillary potential is calculated based on weekly class schedule. Secondly, it has been controlled in real time as per the thermal comfort of occupants to maximize the potential of ancillary service through the HVAC system. To analyze the response of the algorithm for a building, this set-up is scaled up at the level of AHU network installed in the lecture hall complex of an educational building in Delhi. The proposed algorithm has been tested and analyzed on an experimental set-up, synchronized with the thermal-dynamic model of building in MATLAB. It shows that there is a potential of ancillary service up to 97 kW in non-scheduled period and for the scheduled period it can be increased by 20% to 59% of available reserve power.",
