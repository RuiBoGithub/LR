Dept. of Architectural Engineering Yonsei University 50 Yonsei-ro, Seodaemun-Gu 03722, Seoul Republic of Korea The precise prediction of building energy consumption plays an important role in balancing the demand and supply of energy. In general, regular operation patterns occur for non-residential buildings, and the reflection of such operation patterns to models can play a positive role in predicting building energy consumption. In this study, three long short-term memory (LSTM) models were created, and the results were compared to examine the effect of applying the operation pattern data of a non-residential building on the prediction performance of the LSTM model. Each model exhibited different results according to the type of the input data used: (i) case 1 \u2013 building environmental data; (ii) case 2 \u2013 building environmental data and outdoor environmental data; and (iii) case 3 \u2013 building environmental data, outdoor environmental data, and operation pattern data. The building exhibited regular schedules by time and cycle according to the occupancy characteristics. When the prediction model utilized additional variables related to building operation as input data, it exhibited better performance than the other cases. The prediction performances in best case were 17.6% for CVRMSE and 0.6% for MBE. Applying insights into the change points at which the energy consumption pattern of the building changes was reflected to the model resulted in a higher pattern similarity than the other cases. Keywords Heating energy consumption Prediction model Long short-term memory (LSTM) Building operation pattern Change point 1 Introduction 1.1 Background According to the Global Energy & CO2 Status Report, the global energy consumption growth rate doubled in 2018 compared to that in 2010 due to the global economic boom and high heating and cooling needs [1]. An increase in energy consumption leads to the emission of various greenhouse gases (GHGs) in large quantities, and such GHGs are among the elements that greatly cause climate change. Carbon dioxide, one of the representative GHGs, is mainly generated in the fossil fuel combustion process for energy generation, and the global carbon dioxide emissions increased by 60% in 2017 compared to that in 1990 [2]. As carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere for more than a hundred years, countermeasures to reduce carbon dioxide emissions are required [3]. Various efforts have been made worldwide to achieve the common goal of reducing energy consumption and GHG emissions [4]. For developed countries, building energy consumption accounts for 20\u201340% of the total energy consumption, and the energy consumption of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems represents half of the building energy consumption [5]. Therefore, the aggressive management of the building field, which is the main source of energy consumption, is important in the reduction of the total energy consumption. Energy companies are producing excessive energy to ensure the stable supply of energy to buildings, thereby causing energy waste and social problems. This is because energy is more difficult to store compared to other resources and energy needs to be immediately supplied and consumed on the demand side as soon as it is produced [6]. In other words, energy waste can be minimized if the demand and supply of building energy are balanced. In particular, the prediction of energy consumption plays a key role in balancing the demand and supply in terms of energy management [7]. For these reasons, the precise prediction of building energy consumption is required to prevent energy waste and optimize the demand and supply of energy [8]. 1.2 Literature review Over the few years, studies have been actively conducted for efficient building operation by combining building energy consumption prediction methods with optimized algorithms [9]. Building energy consumption prediction methods include the physical modeling approach and data-driven approach [10]. Physical models thermodynamically perform energy modeling and analysis using building energy simulation, such as EnergyPlus, eQUEST, and Ecotect. These models require various building and environmental parameters, such as building constructions, operation schedules, HVAC system design, and climate information, to calculate building energy consumption [11]. In particular, the expertise of a simulator is important because some detailed data are difficult to obtain and the input of inaccurate data leads to low prediction performance. Conversely, for data-driven modeling, modeling is relatively easier because learning from historical or available data is performed instead of requiring detailed data as in simulation modeling [12]. Initial data-driven methods were mainly statistical models, such as multiple linear regression and Gaussian process regression. Han et al. [13] developed a stepwise multiple regression model to predict the mean radiant temperature as a data driven approach for anyone can easily access and use the model. Statistical models exhibit strength in processing stationary and linear series data but poor prediction performance for nonlinear time-series data, such as building energy data. Recently, building energy has been predicted through machine learning methods in data-driven modeling, and these prediction methods have attracted attention in many studies due to their high reliability and prediction accuracy [14]. As for machine learning algorithms for building energy prediction, decision trees, artificial neural networks (ANN), and support vector machines (SVMs) have been traditionally used [15]. Among them, SVMs and ANNs have the ability to solve problems through self-learning processes [16], and ANNs especially implement data processing procedures in a manner similar to that of the brain [17]. The utilization of SVM and ANN algorithms represents three quarters of the studies related to building energy prediction based on machine learning, indicating that methods based on artificial intelligence (AI) have been recently used as the main prediction models [10]. Ahmad et al. [18] predicted building electrical energy consumption using ANN and SVM algorithms. They revealed that models combining these algorithms exhibited high accuracy and can be applicable to prediction models. Li et al. [9] predicted cooling and heating energy consumption using ANNs for building energy optimization in the initial design stage. The input variables used were the window area ratio, which is the design element of office buildings, the length and width of the building, the number of floors and floor height of the building, and the number of rooms. The prediction of cooling and heating energy exhibited error rates of less than 10%. Deng et al. [19] developed an ANN model for predicting energy use intensity using the data of the Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey conducted by the US Department of Energy on the energy use of commercial buildings. The developed ANN model exhibited 10%\u201315% lower prediction errors than linear regression prediction models. Because it is difficult to secure accuracy in predicting building energy using current data alone, efforts have been made to utilize past and current data together. Jain et al. [20] utilized the SVM algorithm to predict the electricity consumption of multi-family housing and used the electricity consumption of the previous two-time steps, current temperature, current hour, a denote for weekend/holiday or weekday, and current solar flux as prediction variables. Analyzing energy using only the data of the past few steps, however, is insufficient to interpret the overall flow. Essentially, building energy prediction must adopt a time-series prediction approach in which the chronological data observed in the past are analyzed to judge future phenomena [21]. By systematically analyzing the past observations, the future of the phenomenon can be predicted, and such a process is called time series forecasting [22]. Traditional ANNs, however, have limitations in analyzing time-series data with continuous data characteristics because they recognize all input data independently [23]. To overcome such limitations, ANNs have continuously evolved and became a deep learning architecture, enabling a more in-depth prediction than before. The representative examples of ANNs are recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM), which have been actively utilized in the research on building energy prediction. Bouktif et al. [24] constructed a model for predicting short-term and mid-term total loads using a neural network (NN) based on LSTM. The LSTM model predicted loads with significantly high accuracy. Kong et al. [25] proposed a framework for predicting the short-term load using the LSTM algorithm and the actual data of a residential building. The proposed LSTM framework generally exhibited the highest prediction performance for datasets. Jiao et al. [26] proposed a model for predicting the load of a non-residential building based on the LSTM algorithm. The proposed framework was constructed based on an actual dataset, including the energy consumption data of 48 non-residential buildings. Kim and Cho [27] developed a model for predicting the energy consumption of a residential building through the combination of LSTM and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to accurately predict energy consumption for stable power supply. CNNs, which were originally invented for image processing, were used to extract the features of variables that affect energy consumption in the study. LSTM can identify information that has an irregular tendency of time-series data. In this study, a CNN\u2013LSTM model was developed by combining the features of the two models, and electricity energy consumption, which was difficult to predict previously, was predicted almost perfectly. In particular, a high prediction accuracy was also observed even in minute, hourly, daily, and weekly data. In the building energy field, AI-related studies have been actively conducted using various algorithm models in addition to the aforementioned SVMs, ANNs, RNNs, and LSTM. Among them, LSTM is focused on subjects that deal with time-series data that are suitable for the characteristics of the algorithm, and its prediction accuracy was found to be significantly higher compared to existing ANN models. Because the building energy consumption data to be dealt with in this study have time-series characteristics in which data change over time, an AI algorithm specialized in time-series data processing is required for accurate prediction. To predict the energy consumption of a building, there are several variables that should be considered. First, the characteristics of the building should be considered. In particular, the building energy prediction process requires various types of data for accurate prediction. Zhang et al. [15] conducted a research on the trend of building load prediction and particularly summarized the main variables that were generally used. They summarized the input data used in many building load prediction areas into approximately 70 variables and classified categories into the time indicator, building operation status, weather conditions, time lags, occupancy variables, and building design. Most of these data consist of data measured through sensors or the information of buildings obtained through surveys. Some research was considered the weather condition to increase prediction performance. Anđelković et al. [28] developed the hourly natural gas consumption prediction. The authors focused on forecasting weather to develop the natural gas prediction model. The results show that the prediction accuracy is very satisfactory, demonstrating the necessity of integrating a weather forecast into the prediction model. Cholewa et al. [29] developed a simple building energy model that accounts for the actual heat power supply and outdoor weather conditions of a building for predicting the heating energy consumption. The proposed energy model shows the high accuracy of prediction depending on external factors such as outdoor temperature, wind speed, and solar insolation. However, occupant data could also be considered to predict energy consumption. Cholewa et al. [30] developed the short-term prediction model for heat power demand in the existing building. This study proposed the prediction method which takes into account the occupant behavior to increase the prediction performance. The authors found that it is recommended to update the data profiles because the occupant behavior could change over time. As in the trend analysis of these studies, many recent studies used the primary raw data collected through sensors or surveys, and few used factors that are related to building operation patterns as variables. Unlike residential buildings, building operation patterns, such as building loads and occupancy schedules, regularly occur at the same time point in different days for non-residential buildings [31]. In addition, building energy consumption not only has weekly rhythms, but it also clearly shows daily patterns for all of seven days [32]. In particular, non-residential buildings have small load fluctuations during a short time period, and daily load patterns tend to be similar [26]. Because traditional prediction methods have hardly made efforts to reflect the understanding of the operation patterns of such non-residential buildings, this may act as a limitation in creating precise prediction models. 1.3 Study objectives With advances in AI technology, various changes have also occurred in methods for predicting building energy consumption. As the existing prediction technology evolved from physical or statistical methods to deep learning methods, building energy consumption can now be predicted more accurately and concisely. In particular, utilizing a suitable prediction algorithm is important for building energy data with time-series characteristics, and the recent appearance of the LSTM algorithm satisfies such needs. Machine learning methods, including LSTM, require various input variables for prediction. In previous studies related to building energy prediction, focus was given to using the design information of the target building or sensor data (e.g., temperature and humidity) as prediction variables. For the traditional building energy consumption prediction method that utilizes such primary raw data collected, however, the best performance cannot be easily anticipated because such raw data might not have lots of information about building energy consumption directly. On the other hand, operation patterns of the building are highly related to energy consumption in the buildings. Previous studies were less considered the data of operation pattern for predicting the building energy consumption. In the case of non-residential buildings, operation patterns tend to be significantly regular. If such data are utilized as the variables of the prediction model, they can provide positive results for prediction performance. Therefore, in this study, a building energy prediction model was constructed, and a method to improve prediction accuracy was proposed using heating energy consumption and the operation data of a non-residential building. The prediction model was constructed using the LSTM algorithm specialized in building energy prediction. In particular, an attempt was made to examine the effect of applying insights into the operation pattern of the non-residential building to the LSTM model using newly processed additional variables on building energy prediction performance. Because most non-residential buildings have regular operation schedules, this study is expected to figure out that the operation pattern of the non-residential buildings plays an essential role in predicting the building energy consumption more precisely and widely by using the proposed method. 2 Methodologies 2.1 Prediction methods In section 2, the research methodology are explained. In this study, in order to find out what effect the operation pattern data has on the prediction model, the process of predicting the heating energy consumption of a building was conducted in four steps, as shown in Fig. 1 . In step 1, the data for conditions of target building (Temperature, humidity, irradiation, etc.) were measured from the sensors, and data were classified into building environment data or outdoor environment data. In step 2, the operation pattern of building heating energy consumption was analyzed using the Prophet model. Patterns related to trends, seasonality, and holiday were extracted and used as input data that can reflect the operation cycle of the building. In step 3, a prediction model was constructed using the data summarized in steps 1 and 2 as input data based on the LSTM model. The list for used input data for each case is shown in Fig. 2 . Three cases were created using different input data to compare the impacts of the combination of such input data on the model. Case 1 is a model constructed using only the group 1 data (building environment) in step 1, whereas case 2 is a model that utilizes the group 1 and 2 data (building environment and outdoor environment), which are all the data measured using the sensors in step 1. Case 3 is a model that utilizes the data reflecting the operation pattern of the building in addition to all the sensor data. The output values of the LSTM model are the hourly heating energy consumption values for the next 24 h. In step 4, the accuracy of each model was evaluated and analyzed based on the standards presented in the ASHRAE Guideline 14 that provides guidelines for reliably measuring the energy, demand, and water savings achieved in conservation projects. 2.2 Building descriptions In this subsection, the basic information of building where the data was measured is explained. In this study, the data collected from a building were used to construct the heating energy consumption prediction model. The building is a daycare center located in Jincheon, South Korea, and its specifications are presented in Table 1 . The average temperature on site during the experiment period is about 3.5 °C (Max temperature: 18.4 °C, min temperature: −9.1 °C, standard deviation: 4.7 °C). Heating degree day (HDD) is about 2800 °C·days. The town in which this building is located has a large-scale solar thermal system. The solar heat preserved in a large-capacity thermal storage is supplied for the heating and domestic hot water (DHW) of buildings in a manner similar to that of a district heating system. When the supply of solar heat is insufficient, heat is produced through the heat pump in the central machine room and supplied to the building. After the heating energy is supplied from the central large-capacity thermal storage tank to the machine room of the target building, the heat supplied to the building is transferred to the building side through a heat exchanger, and the fan coil units (FCU) is used for the heating of the building. According to set-point temperature, FCU supplies heating for each room. Control of FCU is based on return air temperature of room. Detailed technical information on the HVAC system is presented in Table 1. Table 2 shows the operation information of the building. Building is operated from 9 AM to 8 PM and official holidays are Saturday and Sunday. Recommended set-point temperature of each room is 21 °C. 2.3 Data descriptions The data used in this study is explained in subsection 2.3. In the building, environment-related data were collected from sensors and sequentially stored. Fig. 3 shows the types of sensors installed in the building and Table 3 the list of the data used for the construction of the prediction model [33]. Indoor environment sensors were installed on the wall of each room. Indoor temperature and humidity for each room is measured in real-time. Calorimeter sensor were installed to measure the heat for heating in the mechanical room of the building. This sensor measures supply and return temperature and flow meter data. Heating energy consumption is calculated by measured calorimeter data. In Fig. 3 for calorimeter, left picture is sensor for temperature of water and right picture is calculator for energy consumption. Outdoor environment sensors were installed outside the building and measure real-time data for temperature, humidity and solar irradiation. Building environment data (Calorimeter data and indoor environment data) is measured every minute and outdoor environment data is measured every 30 s. Collected data was converted into an hour unit and utilized. This study utilized the data during the period from December 6, 2019 to February 12, 2020. The data used are classified into three groups: (i) building environmental data, (ii) outdoor environmental data, and (iii) pattern data for energy consumption. Building environmental data are divided into sensor data to measure the heating energy consumption in the building and indoor environmental data. As for the indoor environmental data, the temperatures and humidity in three rooms and one hall were collected from sensors. To reflect the influence of the outdoor environment, the outdoor temperature, outdoor humidity, and horizontal and inclined solar irradiations were measured. Finally, groups 1 and 2 are the data measured from sensors, and group 3 contains calculated values to reflect the energy consumption patterns of the building. The measured sensor data were winter data from December 6, 2019 to February 12, 2020 (approximately three months), and they were utilized to construct the heating energy consumption prediction model required for heating. Fig. 4 shows the photographs of the building and the locations of the rooms with sensors installed for data collection. Every sensor was installed on the wall of each room. 2.4 Lstm Subsection 2.4 describes why LSTM model was used in this research and its basic feature. A large amount of data collected from an actual building have nonlinear patterns because they depend on the current state of the system that operates dynamically [34]. Therefore, NNs well capture complex nonlinear relationships among variables and can explain the nonlinear relationship between the input and output. An NN with high accuracy is preferred in the architecture field [9]. The data collected from the building were sequentially stored in chronological order. Prediction performance can be improved if the sequential characteristics of such time-series data can be reflected. The RNN model is an algorithm that remembers the values of previous time steps and utilizes past data for learning. Thus, it has strength in constructing a prediction model using time-series data by modeling temporal dependency [35]. RNNs, however, encounter the vanishing/exploding gradient problem in which the influence of the initial input values gradually decreases with accumulating data [36]. LSTM that supplements the RNN problem has strength in utilizing long-term sequential data. LSTM has a self-loop structure to store temporal information in a cell\u2019s state. Fig. 5 shows the structure of LSTM, which consists of the following gates: (i) forget gate, (ii) input gate, and (iii) output gate [37]. The forget gate determines the degree of forgetting the information on the past LSTM results and is expressed as follows: f t = σ W f ∙ h t - 1 , x t + b f where ft is the forget gate, σ is the sigmoid activation function, ht-1 is the output of LSTM at timestep t − 1, xt is the input data, W is the weights, and b is the bias. The input gate is the step to determine information to remember among the new information coming in the future: i t = σ ( W i ∙ h t - 1 , x t + b i ) The output gate, which plays the role of creating the final predicted value, is the step to determine the information to be sent to the output based on the cell state. It receives new information by multiplying the output intermediate cell state, C t , by the result of the input gate, it . It also updates the cell state by discarding data by multiplying the past state, Ct−1 , by the result of the forget gate, ft . The output of LSTM, ht , is calculated using the finally updated cell state and the output gate, ot [24]. o t = σ W o ∙ h t - 1 , x t + b o . C t = t a n h W C ∙ h t - 1 , x t + b C . C t = f t ∗ C t - 1 + i t ∗ C t . h t = o t ∗ tanh C t . The above process was repeated in the form of a self-loop in LSTM, and weights were calculated in the direction of minimizing errors. In this study, the Python programming language was used to construct the LSTM model, and the Keras deep learning tool was used. The Keras Backend (version 2.3.1) was used based on TensorFlow. Table 4 summarizes the hyperparameters of the LSTM prediction model used in this study. 2.5 Prophet (pattern extraction) In this subsection, a method to extract operation pattern data from heating energy consumption is explained. For many non-residential buildings, the building operation pattern (e.g., occupancy schedule and operation time) are regular under the influence of human behaviors. Such buildings exhibit constant patterns for energy consumption under the influence of regular human behaviors. For example, in an office building where the morning rush hour is 9 AM, an hourly pattern in which the energy consumption soars around 9 AM occurs due to the movement of people into the building. In addition, daily/weekly patterns in which the energy consumption decreases on company holidays or leave periods may occur due to the non-operation of the building. To reflect these regular patterns of non-residential buildings, Prophet was used in this study and principal is explained in this section. Prophet, which was developed by the data science team of Facebook, is a model for time-series forecasting [38]. Prophet consists of three components, i.e., (i) growth, (ii) seasonality, and (iii) holidays, and is expressed as follows: y t = g t + s t + h t + ε 1 , where g(t) is the trend function for modeling nonperiodic changes in time-series data, s(t) is the function for expressing periodic changes, h(t) is the function for reflecting holidays and other untypical days, and ε1, an error coefficient, is the function for reflecting idiosyncratic changes [39-41]. In this study, the values of g(t), s(t), and h(t), which are intermediate functions, were used as the input data of the prediction model instead of using the output of Prophet, y(t), to infer the energy consumption pattern of the building. In particular, the seasonality calculated by the Fourier series is expected to be helpful in identifying the weekday and hourly pattern characteristics of the building as it is calculated as approximate values of daily and weekly patterns. The corresponding intermediate values were normalized and used for analysis in the results section. Prophet was coded in Python, and Table 5 summarizes the hyperparameters of Prophet. 2.6 Evaluation To evaluate the prediction values derived from the above methodology, in this subsection, the following indices were used: coefficient of variation of root mean square error (CVRMSE) and mean bias error (MBE). According to the ASHRAE Guideline 14, a model is evaluated using these two indices, whose evaluation standards are CVRMSE = 30% and MBE = ±10% [42]. The model used in this study was an hourly prediction model, and it was evaluated using the hourly standard of ASHRAE. CVRMSE and MBE verify the accuracy of a model by comparing the measured and predicted svalues. For CVRMSE and MBE, values closer to zero represent a high accuracy. RMSE = ∑ ( P - X ) 2 N C V R M S E = RMSE μ × 100 ( % ) (P = predicted value of the LSTM model, X = actual data, N = number of actual data, μ = mean of actual data) (P = predicted value of the LSTM model, X = actual data, N = number of actual data) MBE = ∑ ( P - X ) ∑ X × 100 ( % ) 3 Results In this study, LSTM models were developed to predict the heating energy consumption of a building. The operation patterns of the building obtained through the Prophet analysis are presented in Subsection 3.1, and the analysis of the prediction results of each case is discussed in Subsections 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4. The prediction model basically predicts the hourly heating energy consumptions for the next 24 h based on the present time and generates 24 output values at one time point (e.g., the heating energy consumptions of 01:00, 02:00, 03:00, \u2026 , 24:00 are predicted at 00:00). The data used for the training and validation of the model were divided at a ratio of 70:30, and the data from January 31, 2020 to February 12, 2020 were used for validation. In this section, focus was given to the prediction from 09:00 to 20:00 when the building is actually used by occupants. 3.1 Analysis of the consumption pattern As described in Section 2, the intermediate values calculated in the prediction process of the Prophet model, i.e., trends, seasonality, and holiday values, were used as the input data of the LSTM model in this study. The target building of this study is a public building with regular operation pattern among non-residential buildings. Its energy consumption patterns are examined in this subsection through the results of the Prophet model. The intermediate values of Prophet were normalized to values between 0 and 1 for analysis. Figure 6 shows the overall trend of the building heating energy consumption during the period of the data used. The heating energy consumption from December 6, 2019 to February 12, 2020 shows a slight downward trend because the demand for heating gradually decreases as the winter period comes to an end. In particular, the fluctuations in trend are related to the outdoor temperature. The heating energy consumption shows a tendency to increase during the cycle when the outdoor temperature decreases, and it tends to decrease when the outdoor temperature increases. Therefore, the heating energy consumption of the building tends to show sensitive response to changes in the outdoor environment. Figure 7 (a) shows the calculated daily seasonality results among the intermediate values of Prophet. Fig. 7(b) shows the heating energy consumption by hour in a box plot. Values outside the 1.5 IQR range in box plot are generally considered outliers. In this study, however, data was collected from building in operation, and there are many causes for values outside the 1.5 IQR in actual building under normal circumstances (e.g. significant increase of the number of occupants, little or no energy consumption in the case of holidays, energy consumption by night worker during the non-operating hours, etc.) So these values were considered as normal data, not outliers. Fig. 7(a), which presents the approximate values of the daily pattern calculated based on the Fourier series of Prophet, shows a significantly similar tendency to the median values in Fig. 7(b). There are, however, slight differences in the low-energy-consumption section (non-operating hours of the building). These results appear to be attributed to the few values located outside the 1.5 interquartile range standard during the operating hours of the building and many values located outside the standard during the non-operating hours of the building. In other words, cycles are similar under the influence of human behavior in a constant pattern during the operating hours of the building, but the building operates relatively irregularly during the non-operating hours. When the operation pattern of the building was analyzed by hour, the building energy consumption gradually increases from 7 AM and a peak is recorded approximately at 9 AM. This is because heating begins as occupants move into the building to increase the indoor temperature of the building that was low during the non-operating hours, and a peak occurs approximately at 9 AM when all occupants are present. In particular, the energy consumption is recorded as the local minimum value during the lunch time between 12 PM and 1 PM due to the suspension of work. It slightly increases after 1 PM due to the resumption of work and then decreases again. The heating energy consumption slowly decreases in the afternoon due to the influence of solar irradiation because the demand for heating gradually decreases as heat is accumulated in the thermal mass of the building. At 8 PM, the energy consumption rapidly decreases due to the termination of the building operation. As shown in Fig. 7, the phenomenon that change points occur in specific time periods was generated by repeated cycles in the target building because the building is a non-residential building with a regular operation. Figure 8 (a) shows the calculated weekly seasonality results among the intermediate values of Prophet. Fig. 8(b) shows the heating energy consumption by day in a box plot. Fig. 8(a) shows the weekly pattern from Sunday to Saturday, and this weekly cycle is repeated in the building. In particular, this building exhibits significantly low energy consumption on Saturday and Sunday because it does not operate on weekends and a minimum of employees work on those days. In addition, the heating energy consumption of the building is significantly high on Monday and decreases toward the weekend. This pattern is attributed to the increased demand for heating to increase the low temperature of the thermal mass of the building as the building is not normally operated due to minimal heating during the weekend. This finding explains the high energy consumption during Mondays. In addition, the demand for heating shows a tendency to slowly decrease toward the weekend because the thermal mass is maintained at higher temperatures compared to that during Mondays due to the continuous building operation schedule. 3.2 Case 1 Case 1 is a model that used only the building environmental data as input data for LSTM and the simple raw data collected from the sensors inside the building, such as calorimeter-related data and building indoor environmental data. Fig. 9 shows the prediction results for the next 1 h when the model was constructed using only the data measured from the building. As shown in the early prediction in Fig. 9(a), accuracy was significantly low for several days, which appears to be attributed to the different environmental pattern of the building from the usual pattern. In particular, the predicted values during the operating hours formed a smooth line with no singularity due to the absence of variables capable of detecting the change points of energy consumption (e.g., lunch time and closing hour) that occur during the building operating hours. Figure 10 shows the prediction results of the model for the next 24 h at 00:00 and 12:00 on a certain day (February 7). The prediction model of this study predicts the building energy consumption patterns for the next 24 h and derives 24 outputs from the current time step, as shown in the figure. The prediction results show significantly low prediction performance around the morning rush hour, lunch time, and closing hour because change points for the operation pattern of the building could not be found, as shown in Fig. 9. Overall, the pattern without inflection points was observed. 3.3 Case 2 Case 2 is a model that used outdoor environmental data in addition to the building environmental data used in case 1 as input data for LSTM. It also used the simple raw data collected from sensors as with case 1, and the prediction results for the next 1 h are shown in Fig. 11 . In this case, outdoor environmental data that sensitively act on the heating demand of the building were added because the purpose of this study is to develop a model for predicting heating energy consumption during winter. Unlike case 1 in which only the data collected from the inside of the building were used, when outdoor environmental data were used, the prediction accuracy was improved on early several days (Fig. 11(a)) as compared with those shown in Fig. 9(a). Consequently, the sections that exhibited low pattern similarity between the predicted and actual data decreased. The CVRMSE accuracy, however, rather slightly decreased compared to that of case 1, but the MBE performance that indicates the degree of bias was improved. Figure 12 shows the prediction results of the case 2 prediction model for the next 24 h at 00:00 and 12:00 on a certain day (February 7). The prediction results could not find change points for building heating energy consumption patterns as with the results of case 1. Compared to case 1, various situations could be learned by the model and the bias of the prediction results could be reduced as many input data were used and more variables were considered, but the accuracy of the prediction model was not improved. 3.4 Case 3 Case 3 is a model that used variables capable of reflecting building operation patterns in addition to the building environmental data and outdoor environmental data used in case 2 as input data for LSTM. It performed feature addition through the secondary processing of significant variables that did not exist previously, unlike the previous models that used only the simple raw data collected from sensors. The prediction results of the case 3 model for the next 1 h are shown in Fig. 13 . Unlike the results of the previous models, the pattern similarity between the predicted and actual data significantly increased for the dates of all test data used for validation, as shown in Fig. 13(a). In addition, the results in Fig. 13(b) confirm that the predicted data were balanced as the degree of bias to one side was significantly reduced. In particular, as shown in Fig. 14 , the case 3 prediction model for the next 24 h exhibited a significant improvement in prediction performance as it reflected change points that cases 1 and 2 did not find. This model significantly improved prediction performance because it utilized daily and weekly pattern data capable of reflecting the regular operation cycles of the building and thus reflected change points at which energy consumption sharply changes, such as the morning rush hour, lunch time, and closing hour. 4 Discussion Table 6 shows the accuracy results of each case. Cases 1 and 2 are models that used the data collected from sensors, whereas case 3 is a model that created significant variables capable of reflecting the regularity of data and added them as input data. Cases 1 and 2 satisfied the standards of the ASHRAE Guideline14 as CVRMSE was 26.3% for case 1 and 27.6% for case 2, but they did not have high prediction performance. Case 3 that improved the input data used exhibited significantly higher prediction performance compared to the two previous models as CVRMSE was 17.6% for the test data. In particular, it exhibited balanced prediction as MBE was 0.6%. Figure 15 is a graph that compares the predicted and actual values of each case. The distribution of case 1 was widely spread, confirming that the prediction results were considerably biased to one side. Case 2 was less biased compared to case 1, but the predicted values were significantly away from the ideal line. For case 3, however, the predicted values were gathered near the ideal line in a balanced manner. Figure 16 shows the prediction results of each case at the change points analyzed in Subsection 3.1. There were largely four change points, i.e., the morning rush hour (09:00), lunch time (12:00), end of lunch time (13:00), and closing hour (20:00). The average values of the accuracies calculated at each hour were found to be 24% for case 1, 26% for case 2, and 20% for case 3. As shown in Fig. 16(a), the results of case 3 exhibited reasonable prediction performance for most of the change points, and all of its prediction accuracies were less than 30%, which follows the standard of the ASHRAE Guideline14. However, prediction model is slightly biased at lunchtime (12:00, 13:00). Its prediction performance at 9 AM was found to be excellent as CVRMSE was 9% and MBE was 9%. As the maximum peak of building energy consumption was recorded at this hour, the characteristics of the change point immediately after the morning rush hour were well reflected, and this had a positive impact on the learning and accuracy of the model. Fig. 16(b) shows the prediction results of each case at the change points in a box plot. While the results of cases 1 and 2 were unstable as the ranges of the predicted values were very wide for the results at the same time points, case 3 derived high accuracy in a stable manner, confirming that the model learning was performed quite reasonably. In the field of deep-learning algorithms, a large amount of variables are used to improve accuracy in many cases. Therefore, in the building sector, there can be attempts to manage energy based on hardware by installing many sensors to secure a large amount of data. The accuracy comparison between cases 1 and 2, however, shows that a large amount of sensor data are not always significantly helpful in improving the model accuracy. The performance of the prediction model can be more significantly improved if the characteristics of the target building are identified and then significant variables are recreated and used as the input data of the model as in case 3 as compared with using a large amount of sensor data. In particular, when the operation pattern of the building is applied to the prediction model as input data, its positive effect is excellent. In general, change points at which energy consumption sharply changes are found in non-residential buildings due to the influence of regular human behavior. If such points are not well predicted, then securing prediction performance becomes difficult because the performance gap between the predicted and actual values significantly increases at time points where changes begin. The results of case 3 show that it is fairly important to secure variables that can consider such change points for securing prediction performance. In other words, insights into time points at which such inflection points occur can be reflected to the model using seasonality variables, such as the weekly energy consumption pattern of the building by day and its daily energy consumption pattern by hour. In other words, the important factor in the prediction of heating energy consumption is the recreation of significant variables using the domain knowledge in the field of architecture rather than the unconditional use of a large amount of variables. The proposed methodology that can reflect the building operation patterns to a model can be applicable to all similar buildings with certain periodicity (e.g., offices, hospitals, libraries, and schools), and the performance of the prediction model can be significantly improved by utilizing such patterns as variables. 5 Conclusions In this study, LSTM models were constructed to predict the heating energy consumption of a non-residential building. Three cases were created according to the input data used in each LSTM model, and the data used for each model were as follows: (i) case 1 \u2013 building environmental data; (ii) case 2 \u2013 building environmental data and outdoor environmental data; and (iii) case 3 \u2013 building environmental data, outdoor environmental data, and pattern data. Among these cases, the one that exhibited the most excellent prediction results was case 3 that reflected the operation pattern and showed a CVRMSE of 17.6% and MBE of 0.6% as its prediction accuracy. In particular, the proposed LSTM model (case 3) effectively reflected the change points of building energy consumption using the pattern of the building with periodicity. This improved the prediction performance of the model while accurately reflecting sections where building energy consumption sharply changes. Finally, the contributions of this study are as follows: \u2022 Many previous studies simply used only the data collected from sensors, and there were few studies that recreated and used significant data. The use of the proposed methodology makes it possible to secure new insights into variables that may have a positive influence on the prediction model. \u2022 The proposed methodology presents a direction that can significantly improve the performance of the prediction model by recreating additional variables through the existing data without installing separate hardware. \u2022 Variables that express the periodicity of building energy consumption (e.g., weekly and daily patterns) can provide insights into change points at which building energy consumption sharply changes. \u2022 The methodology that reflects the operation cycle of a building will be applicable to similar buildings with certain periodicity (e.g., offices, hospitals, libraries, and schools). \u2022 The prediction model that used the proposed methodology is expected to have a positive influence on the prediction performance and be helpful in optimizing the balance between the demand and supply of energy. However, there are several limitations and future improvements in this study. Because it is difficult to apply the operation pattern for the certain building used intermittently or the residential building used irregularly, the methodology used in this study is unlikely to be suitable for these types of buildings. This study may conclude as a different direction when other unique types of buildings are used because the buildings\u2019 cases used in this study were not enough. The second limitation is the type of data used in this study. This study just utilized basic data from sensor for indoor and outdoor environment as input data, such as temperature, humidity, irradiation. If use more valuable and adequate data for prediction (e.g. CO2, wind velocity, wind direction, etc.), the performance of the model will be further improved. In addition prediction model in this study utilized only operation pattern data of heating energy consumption as valuable data. Thus, ultimately in future work, the methodology of this study can be generalized to improve reliability by analyzing operation patterns with large numbers and different types of buildings and also it would be meaningful to find out other valuable data for prediction model (such as indoor environment pattern, occupancy pattern, etc.) CRediT authorship contribution statement Jihoon Jang: Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Methodology, Software, Validation, Visualization, Writing \u2013 original draft.

        "dc:description": "The precise prediction of building energy consumption plays an important role in balancing the demand and supply of energy. In general, regular operation patterns occur for non-residential buildings, and the reflection of such operation patterns to models can play a positive role in predicting building energy consumption. In this study, three long short-term memory (LSTM) models were created, and the results were compared to examine the effect of applying the operation pattern data of a non-residential building on the prediction performance of the LSTM model. Each model exhibited different results according to the type of the input data used: (i) case 1 \u2013 building environmental data; (ii) case 2 \u2013 building environmental data and outdoor environmental data; and (iii) case 3 \u2013 building environmental data, outdoor environmental data, and operation pattern data. The building exhibited regular schedules by time and cycle according to the occupancy characteristics. When the prediction model utilized additional variables related to building operation as input data, it exhibited better performance than the other cases. The prediction performances in best case were 17.6% for CVRMSE and 0.6% for MBE. Applying insights into the change points at which the energy consumption pattern of the building changes was reflected to the model resulted in a higher pattern similarity than the other cases.",
