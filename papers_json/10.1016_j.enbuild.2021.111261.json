Due to the characteristic of large scale, multiple equipment, variable working conditions and complex debugging of air conditioning system in public buildings, the energy efficiency and operating level of the system are limited in the process of operation, and the actual operation effect will deviate from the design expectation. In addition, it is difficult to build an accurate mechanism model and to implement corresponding online control, so the commissioning for controller parameter tuning has to rely on human experience. Meanwhile, the response of indoor temperature to system regulation variables is different for different terminals due to lag characteristic, which would further affect the stability for the overall system. To solve the above problems, an adaptive predictive control method is proposed based on the physical-data driven hybrid model, which could not only realize online self-tuning of terminal controller but also improve control stability of terminal and overall system. Then, taking variable air volume air-conditioning system as the study object, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through comparative experiments. Results show that the proposed method can improve control stability of terminal and overall system. Achievements will have important theoretical significance and wide application prospect for improving the adaptability ability and the overall operating level of air-conditioning system in public buildings, which has complex and time-varying operation condition.

This mode has great advantage in reducing equipment size, saving space and improving energy efficiency, yet it has the following obvious problems: terminals are coupled with each other in the operation process. For example, the actuator action of terminal A will cause the actuator action of adjacent terminal B and C, and in turn the actuator action of terminal B and C will further affect actuator action of terminal A. Moreover, indoor temperature response lags behind the change of system regulation variables in different degree. As a result, the interference between adjacent terminals would become more severe. The above problems will not only cause indoor temperature deviated from its setting value, but also increase the change time of the actuator action and shorten equipment service life. Furthermore, it will affect the control stability of the overall system. For the controlled object with the characteristic of time-varying and multiple influencing factors, common solutions mainly include robust control and adaptive control. However, since the change range of influencing factors are needed to be obtained in advance, the robust-based control methods are not suitable for solving the online self-tuning problem of terminal indoor temperature controller in air-conditioning systems. In the field of building thermal environment, since Farris and McDonald firstly adopted adaptive control in air-conditioning systems in 1980 [1], the adaptive control method has been main way for solving self-tuning problem of controller parameters. Existing adaptive control method (ACM) can be divided into two categories: direct regulation through identifying model [2\u20134] and indirect estimation based on performance index [5,6]. The former relies too much on the transfer function model of the controlled object, which is too ideal to be realized based on conservation laws of mass and energy; the latter needs to depend on complex algorithm design and large amount of calculation, thus it just remains in the simulation phase. In addition, some scholars combine fuzzy control with adaptive control for solving the online self-regulation problem of controller parameters, but these methods still have the shortcoming in the configuration process of initial values and fuzzification/anti-fuzzification boundary values [7,8]. It is worth noting that there are many studies in the field of building thermal environment regulation, including model predictive control [9], adaptive control [10] and optimization [11,12]. However, few works focused on the integration and the optimization between predictive control and adaptive control. Large number of studies have shown that model predictive control (MPC) has shown the advantage on improving the accuracy and the stability in the regulation process of building thermal environment [13\u201315]. The author and his collaborators have proposed an prediction control method based on network neural model, and the proposed method improved the control stability of air-conditioning terminal [16]. If the advantage of adaptive control on online self-tuning of controller parameters and the advantage of MPC on improving stability can be integrated together, namely adaptive predictive control method (APCM), it will be benefit for improving adaptive control performance and the control stability. Recently, APCM has gradually been concerned by scholars in the field of building environment [17\u201319]. However, these studies mostly remain in the phase of the theoretical simulation, and it is difficult to realize its online application [20]. Thus, how to combine regulation mechanism with actual operation and to realize the adaptive and stable operation of the system, is still a challenge. Adaptive control and model predictive control both need rely on online models. Considering that the physical-data driven hybrid model can not only retain the physical property of the controlled object, but also identify the parameters with real-time operation data [21\u201323], it is considered as an effective way for solving the online modeling problem. To provide the reference for online control, the author and his collaborators presented a physical-data driven hybrid model based on regulation mechanism and real-time operation data [24]. Therefore, an adaptive predictive control method is proposed for improving the control performance of air-conditioning terminal in public buildings. This paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, the regulation process of air-conditioning terminal is analyzed. In Section 3, ACM for controller parameters self-tuning and APCM for improving stability are proposed based on online model. In Section 4, the comparative experimental studies between ACM and APCM are carried out. Finally, in Section 5, the results are summarized and the corresponding conclusions are put forward. 2 Analysis of indoor temperature regulation of air-conditioning terminal As shown in Fig. 1 , for the multi-zone air-conditioning system in public buildings, not only the size and the orientation of the room, the number of device, building envelope and ventilation condition are different in different areas, but also the solar radiation, the person movement and other factors would change along with time. Meanwhile, the response of indoor temperature lags behind the actuator action and the change of indoor-outdoor influencing factors. From the control perspective, the terminal controller parameters (such as proportional, integral and differential coefficients in PID control, delay time and threshold conditions in ON/OFF control) for indoor temperature regulation in different rooms should be different from each other; even in the same room, the terminal controller parameters also should be different under different indoor-outdoor operation conditions. That is to say, the parameters of terminal controller for indoor temperature regulation should be online adjusted under different operation conditions. However, indoor temperature regulation process of air-conditioning system has strong nonlinear characteristics, so it is difficult to build its accurate physical model and to implement corresponding online control [25,26]. As a result, the parameters of terminal controller have to be configured by human experience in practice, and the experience and knowledge level of related persons are the important factors for actual operating effect. That is to say, the parameters of indoor temperature controller could not be online self-tuning along with the change of operation conditions, and this process is separated from the regulation mechanism. The system could not operate along with complicated and time-varying indoor environment steadily, and the actual operation effect could not reach its design expectation. The motivation of this study is to solve a practical engineering problem, which may be commonly found in air-conditioning system of public buildings. The purpose of this study is to propose an advanced method, which can improve the action stability of terminal actuator and increase the working life of actuators. To solve above engineering problems, following scientific problems need to be solved: 1) How to build an online mechanism model, which is more suitable for the controller design and is constrained by regulation mechanism. 2) How to acquire and to regulate the controller parameters based on the proposed online model. (3) How to improve the control stability of air-conditioning terminal in public buildings. 3 Adaptive predictive control method based on online model A progressive study will be carried out in this section. Firstly, the physical-data driven hybrid model is built based on conservation laws of mass and energy; then, ACM is proposed based on the proposed model; furthermore, in consideration of lag response characteristics of indoor temperature, APCM is proposed for improving terminal stability. 3.1 Online model for controller parameter extraction The regulation process of air-conditioning systems has typical nonlinear characteristics, especially that indoor temperature response lags behind the change of system regulation variables. However, it is difficult to describe the lag response characteristic using the conservation laws of mass and energy. To be benefit for modeling, the model is firstly built without consideration of indoor temperature lag response characteristic, and then corresponding lag link is added using the following form, which is described in Equation (1). (1) y t = f x , t + d e x , t + ∑ i = 1 n β i y ( t - i ) Where, t is the symbol of time, y t is the expression of the system output at present time; f x , t represents the system input at present time, which is derived based on the conservation laws of mass and energy; d e x , t is the expression of external input or disturbance at present time, which reflects the apparent heat generated inside room. Variable air volume (VAV) is considered as a typical air-conditioning system in large public buildings, and the above problems in VAV systems are more obvious and serious in the actual operation process [27]. Thus, this paper takes VAV as the study object to carry out corresponding studies. The control principle of VAV air-conditioning terminal is shown in Fig. 2 . Without consideration of indoor temperature lag response characteristic, the model of air-conditioning room, which reflects dynamic regulation relationship between indoor temperature and outside-inside influencing factors, can be described in Equation (2). (2) ρ r C P V r d T r t dt = ρ sup C P G sup t T sup t - ρ out C P G out t T r t + Q L ( t ) Where, ρ r represents the air density, 1.29\u202fkg/m3; C P represents specific heat at constant pressure, 1.0\u202fkJ/kg⋅°C; V r represents the volume of air-conditioning room, m3; T r represents temperature of air-conditioning room, ℃; ρ sup and ρ out represent supply air density and return air density, respectively, kg/m3; G sup and G out represent the supply air volume and return air volume, respectively, m3/s; T sup represents supply air temperature, ℃; Q L represents the apparent heat, which is generated from inside-outside influencing, including outdoor air, solar radiation, indoor heat source and indoor storage heat thing etc. Generally, the airflow of air-conditioning room is considered as the incompressible fluid, and there is no phase change. Therefore, air density barely changes, that is to say ρ sup = ρ out = ρ r . The comfort air-conditioning room normally maintains positive pressure, and the ratio of airflow flowing out of the room and into the room, which is described using the symbol of γ , is equal to 0.9\u202f∼\u202f0.95. Therefore, Equation (2) can be simplified as below. (3) ρ r C P V r d T r t dt = ρ r C P G sup t ( T sup - γ T r t ) + Q L ( t ) It can be seen that Equation (3) is the differential equations with non-constant coefficients in the item of G sup t ∗ T r t . From the view of solving equations, it is difficult to calculate the analytical solution so as to describe the relationship between indoor temperature and system regulation variables (supply air volume and supply air temperature). To be convenient for online application, when indoor temperature has reached acceptable error (for example ±\u202f0.2\u202f∼\u202f±0.5\u202f℃) near its setting value at a certain time in the dynamical regulation process, it is assumed that indoor temperature satisfies its setting requirement. The time when indoor temperature satisfies its setting requirement is defined as t sp in this paper. Then, the change of indoor temperature at present time can be described as Equation (4), and corresponding changes of supply air volume, indoor temperature and sensible heat could be described as follow. (4) Δ T r t = T r t - T sp Δ Q L t = Q L t - Q L t sp Δ G sup t = G sup t - G sup t sp Where, T sp represents the setting value of indoor temperature; t sp represents the time when indoor temperature satisfies its setting requirement. It is noted that t sp does not always appear in the dynamic regulation process. In this study, when indoor temperature fluctuates within the acceptable range near its setting value and remains in the stable status, the begin time when indoor temperature comes into the stable status can be recorded as t sp . Because indoor temperature regulation process remains in the stable status, the first-order derivative of indoor temperature d T r t dt can be seen as 0. That is to say the supply cool/heat capacity of air-conditioning room is equal to the its instantaneous load at time of t sp . Thus, Equation (3) could be derived into the following form. (5) ρ r C P V r d T sp dt = ρ r C P G sup t sp [ T sup - γ T sp ] + Q L ( t sp ) = 0 Because the product between Δ G sup t and Δ T r t is very small when indoor temperature fluctuates near its setting value, Δ G sup t Δ T r t is considered as 0 approximately. Then, substitute Equation (5) into Equation (3), and Equation (3) can be converted into the following form. (6) d Δ T r t dt = - γ G sup t sp V r Δ T r t + ( T sup - γ T sp ) V r Δ G sup t + 1 ρ r C P V r Δ Q L t From the view of differential equations, Δ G sup t and Δ Q L t are both time-dependent variables. From the view of control, Δ G sup t and Δ Q L t both can be acquired in real time directly. Thus, the general solution of given differential equation can be described as follows. (7) Δ T r t = B A ( 1 - e - A t ) (8) A = β G sup t sp V r B = T sup - β T sp V r Δ G sup t + 1 ρ r C P V r Δ Q L t 3.2 Adaptive control method based on dynamic model With the advantage of simplicity and practicality, conventional PI algorithm is still widely used control method in air-conditioning system. To obtain the PI controller parameter, it is necessary to build the transfer function of the controlled object according to its differential equation. Thus, Equation (6) is converted into the representation form of the state-space equation, which is easy to be converted into the transfer function. (9) d Δ T r t dt = - A Δ T r t + B Δ G sup t + 1 ρ r C P V r Δ Q L t Δ T r t = Δ T r t Where: (10) A = β G sup t sp V r B = T sup - β T sp V r Δ G sup ( t ) C = 1 D = 0 It can be seen that Equation (9) is not a standard single-input\u2013single-output state-space equation form, because there is a term of 1 ρ r C P V r Δ Q L t . Generally, in the adjacent control period, Δ Q L is very small and can be neglected, because indoor temperature fluctuates within the acceptable range near its setting value. Thus, the transfer function can be obtained according to the relationship between state-space equation and transfer function ( G s = C ( s I - A ) - 1 B + D ), which is described in Equation (11). (11) G s = Δ T r s Δ G sup s = ( T sup - β T sp ) V r s + β G sup t sp V r = ( T sup - β T sp ) β G sup t sp V r β G sup t sp s + 1 In this way, utilizing Ziegler and Nichols empirical formula which has been widely used in practical engineering [28], the inertia-time coefficient T m can be calculated according to Equation (12) directly, without consideration of the lag link. Meanwhile, pure lag time coefficient τ m can be obtained through step-response test or relay feedback control experiment [29]. (12) T m = V r β G sup t sp As a result, according to Z-N empirical formula, the tuning result is given in Equation (13). (13) K p = 0.9 T m τ m K i = τ m 0.3 Where, K p and K i represent proportionality coefficient and integration coefficient of PI controller, respectively; T m and τ m represent the inertia time coefficient and pure lag time coefficient, respectively. According to above derivation process, the control principle of ACM based on physical-data driven hybrid model is proposed in Fig. 3 . It can be seen that PI controller parameters can be calculated in real time by theoretical derivation and online test. For the comfort air-conditioning system without high control accuracy requirement of indoor temperature, ACM can satisfy thermal comfort demand. However, the dynamic model is updated in real time, and then controller parameters will be changed in real time. Thus, it is difficult to ensure the stability of terminal actuator due to indoor temperature lag response characteristic, which will further affect the stability of the overall system. 3.3 Adaptive predictive control for improving stability To improve control stability, APCM is proposed based on the proposed ACM in section 3.2 in consideration of indoor temperature lag response characteristics, and the influence on the control stability. The principle of the proposed APCM is shown in Fig. 4 . The proposed APCM adopts periodic control mode, and the control period is pure lag time of indoor temperature to system regulation variables. The terminal actuator is controlled according to the error between the prediction value and its setting value, and controller parameters can be calculated using the Z-N formula. It can be seen that the performance of the proposed APCM depends on the online prediction model strongly. Thus, in this section, the online prediction model with consideration of lag response characteristics is directly given in Equation (14) based on Equation (7), under the condition that Δ Q L is neglected. (14) Δ T r t = B ∗ ( x ) A ( 1 - e - A t ) + ∑ i = 1 n β i T r t - i (15) A = β G sup t sp V r B ∗ ( x ) = T sup - β T sp V r Δ G sup t - x Where, T r and V r represent indoor temperature and air volume of air-conditioning room, respectively; Δ represents the symbol of the change quantity; G sup and T sup represent supply air volume and supply air temperature, respectively; C P and ρ r represent specific heat at constant pressure and air density, respectively; Q L represents apparent heat generated inside room; β i represents correlation coefficient between indoor temperature at present time and that at previous time; n represents pure lag time coefficient of indoor temperature to system regulation variables; x represents time symbol of input variable in function B ∗ , and it is decided according to the lag response characteristic of indoor temperature to supply air volume. It can be seen that Equation (14) describes the relationship between the change of indoor temperature and the change of system regulation variables according to theoretical derivation. Inevitably, there is an error between theoretical model and real-time model. To solve this problem, a physical-data driven hybrid model is utilized, which is built based on theoretical derivation and real-time operation data. Thus, the physical-data driven hybrid model adopts the form of multiple regression model as the reference, which is benefit for identifying model parameters online. Meanwhile, to be convenient for online application, the following process need to be done as follows. (1) The sensible heat generated inside room remains unchanged in adjacent control period approximately, that is to say, Δ Q L is equal to zero; (2) Due to lag response characteristic of indoor temperature to system regulation variables, indoor temperature at present time is just related to supply air volume and supply air temperature at n -th time, and then ∑ i = 1 n T r t - i can be simplified as T r t - n . As a result, the discrete difference formulas of preceding and following are given in Equation (16) and (17). (16) Δ T r t = a 0 + a 1 ∗ - B ∗ ( n ) A e - A t + a 2 ∗ B ∗ a + a 3 ∗ T r t - n (17) Δ T r t + n = a 0 + a 1 ∗ - B ∗ ( 0 ) A e - A t + a 2 ∗ B ∗ a + a 3 ∗ T r t A = β G sup t sp V r B ∗ ( x ) = T sup - β T sp V r Δ G sup t - x Where, a 0 , a 1 , a 2 and a 3 represent the model coefficients, which need to be calculated online by multiple regression analysis. Detail identification and application process of the online model are described in Fig. 5 . (1) Taking the system input at previous time and the change of indoor temperature at the present time as the sampling set, the coefficients ( a 0 , a 1 , a 2 and a 3 ) are identified by multiple regression analysis. (2) Utilizing identified model coefficients, the change of indoor temperature at next time will be predicted according to system inputs and outputs at present time. (3) T r t + n is calculated according to the formula of T r t + n = Δ T r t + n + T r t , and then the online control is implemented based on the prediction value of indoor temperature. 4 Experimental study 4.1 Experimental system description In this study, the experiment is carried out in the network control platform of VAV air-conditioning system in Dalian University of Technology, which is shown in Fig. 6 and Table 1 respectively. The network control platform is a single-floor building with the height of 4\u202fm and the building area of 160 square meters. Corresponding control system adopts Siemens S7-1200 PLC (Programmable logic controller), and it is difficult to write the program of multiple regression analysis in PLC integration development environment. To simplify this process, the identification of model parameters is done in Python development platform, and the identification result is transmitted into PLC based on Modbus-TCP communication protocol in real time. 4.2 Experimental implementation In this section, the implementation process of ACM and APCM is given. As shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, the difference between ACM and APCM is the reference value of indoor temperature feedback. In the ACM, the feedback value of indoor temperature is actual measured value; In the APCM, the feedback value of indoor temperature is the prediction value. Meanwhile, as shown in Equation ((11)\u2013(13)), the calculation processes of PI controller parameter in ACM and APCM are the same, and corresponding implementation flow is shown in Fig. 7 . It can been that it is easy to calculate the parameters of model and controller using the loop and judgment logic online. 4.3 Experiment condition In order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed APCM, the comparative study is carried out in this section. Considering that 2# room has better building envelope, it is selected as the study object, in order to eliminate the influence caused by door-window penetration and building envelope. Meanwhile, only one temperature sensor is installed in a single room, and the actions of all dampers are consistent in a single room, that is to say, the damper feedbacks in the same room are the same. In order to satisfy the condition requirement of comparative experiments as much as possible, the comparative experiments are carried out under adjacent two periods with the same outdoor temperature. In order to reduce the influence on the experimental results caused by the change of supply air static pressure, supply air fan control loop adopts constant static pressure control, and the setting value of static pressure is determined as 60\u202fPa by the on-site commissioning. The relevant information is shown in Table 2 . 4.4 Experimental results and analysis The comparative experimental results of ACM and APCM are described in Figs. 8 and 9 respectively. In APCM experiment, the damper is regulated according to the difference between the prediction value and the setting value; while, in ACM experiment, the damper is regulated according to the difference between the actual measured value and the setting value. It can be seen that under the two methods, actual measured value of indoor temperature could meet its setting requirement, and the errors are both between\u202f±\u202f1℃. It can be noted that the prediction value of indoor temperature follows its actual measured value, and the average error between them is 0.16 ℃, which also satisfy the prediction control requirement for indoor temperature. In addition, it can be seen that the integral coefficients ( K i ), which are calculated based on online model, are both equal to 1, while the proportionality coefficients ( K p ) are both fluctuate between 0.5 and 1. It is noted that APCM adopts period control model, and corresponding control period is 300\u202fs. Compared with ACM, adopting APCM could reduce 64% of terminal damper change time and 44% of terminal damper displacement under the same operating condition, which can improve the stability of terminal damper and the service life of equipment significantly. Corresponding comparative result is described in Table 3 . 5 Conclusion In this paper, an adaptive predictive control method for terminal indoor temperature in air-conditioning system is proposed for improving the control performance, especially for the stability. Firstly, the terminal regulation process of multi-zone air-conditioning system is analyzed. Secondly, the online model, which is suitable for controller parameter extraction, is built. Thirdly, ACM for parameter self-tuning and ACPM for improving control stability based on physical-data driven hybrid model are proposed. Finally, taking the VAV system as the study object, the comparative experimental studies are carried out in order to validate the control effectiveness of ACM and APCM. According to experimental results, there are some conclusion as follow. 1) The ACM and APCM can solve the online self-tuning problem of controller parameters in air-conditioning terminal effectively. 2) The APCM, which can combine the advantages of adaptive control in self-tuning for controller parameters and model predictive control in improving stability, has better indoor temperature control effect. 3) The APCM can improve the stability of air-conditioning terminal, comparing with ACM. Although this paper takes VAV as the study object to carry out corresponding studies, the related modeling and control methods are also suitable for other types of air-conditioning systems adopting terminal actuators with continuous regulating function, such as VRF terminal with variable frequency control and fan coil unit with direct-current converter. In future work, the related studies for other types of air-conditioning systems adopting continuous-regulating type terminal and on/off type terminal will be carried out to improve the general applicability of the proposed method.

        "dc:description": "Due to the characteristic of large scale, multiple equipment, variable working conditions and complex debugging of air conditioning system in public buildings, the energy efficiency and operating level of the system are limited in the process of operation, and the actual operation effect will deviate from the design expectation. In addition, it is difficult to build an accurate mechanism model and to implement corresponding online control, so the commissioning for controller parameter tuning has to rely on human experience. Meanwhile, the response of indoor temperature to system regulation variables is different for different terminals due to lag characteristic, which would further affect the stability for the overall system. To solve the above problems, an adaptive predictive control method is proposed based on the physical-data driven hybrid model, which could not only realize online self-tuning of terminal controller but also improve control stability of terminal and overall system. Then, taking variable air volume air-conditioning system as the study object, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through comparative experiments. Results show that the proposed method can improve control stability of terminal and overall system. Achievements will have important theoretical significance and wide application prospect for improving the adaptability ability and the overall operating level of air-conditioning system in public buildings, which has complex and time-varying operation condition.",
