In the United States, as much as 30% of the 19 EJ that commercial buildings consume is considered excess. Much of the excess energy is due to the inability to manage building operations efficiently. Because almost 20% of the total primary energy consumption is associated with commercial buildings, significant energy reductions in this sector are needed to mitigate climate change. Therefore, many cities and states are mandating periodic \u201ctune-ups\u201d of these buildings to eliminate excess energy consumption. Although the benefits of tune-ups and retro-commissioning are clear, focusing these mandates to look for specific opportunities has been a challenge because of the lack of studies that document the prevalence of opportunities. Therefore, we analyzed building automation system data from 151 buildings across the United States to document common operational problems and opportunities to improve building operations. This analysis showed that opportunities to improve building operations exist in almost every building. These opportunities were not strongly correlated with building vintage or size, but were reflective of how the buildings are operated. The prevalence of the top 20 opportunities ranged between 74% and 23%, with 40% of these associated with air-handling units. The rest of the opportunities are associated with schedules, chilled and hot-water distribution, and zone controls. Of the 151 buildings, 69 of them implemented corrective actions of some or all opportunities that were identified. Implementation varied across the Re-tuning categories, with 60% for schedule opportunities, 50% for zone opportunities, over 40% for the air-handling unit and hot-water opportunities, and 35% of the chilled-water opportunities. There was wide variation in whole building energy savings, ranging from 0 to 50% and 0 to 18 $/m2 with median percent annual whole building savings of 12% and median normalized annual cost savings of $1.75/m2. In addition to documenting these key findings, the paper provides a list of opportunities that can be automatically and continuously identified and corrected and offers a list of those opportunities that should be the focus of the mandates. Keywords Building operations Commercial buildings Re-tuning/retro-commissioning Building automation systems Prevalence of building operational opportunities 1 Introduction In 2019, the energy use associated with buildings globally was approximately 128 EJ [1]. In the United States (U.S.), buildings consumed almost 42 EJ, of which commercial buildings were responsible for 19 EJ [2]. The energy consumption associated with buildings has been steadily growing; the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimated that if current consumption trends continue, the energy use and emissions associated with buildings could double or even triple by 2050 [3]. The IPCC study also noted that if today\u2019s cost-effective best practices and technologies are broadly used, energy consumption associated with buildings could remain at current levels or even decrease by 2050. This implies that there is vast potential to improve the energy efficiency of buildings. In addition, mitigation of climate change will require significant reductions in building energy consumption. In existing commercial buildings, the reduction in energy consumption can be achieved through deep retrofits and improving building operations. In addition, commercial buildings can also add distributed solar generation with battery storage. Deep retrofits and addition of distributed generation with storage could be cost-effective investments, but they will require significant capital investments. Improving commercial building operations on the other hand can and should be performed with very little investment costs. A building automation system (BAS) is required to operate a commercial building efficiently and optimally. In the United States, only 14% of the commercial building stock is controlled by BASs. Because the use of BASs is typically associated with large (>10,000 m2) commercial buildings, the area associated with these buildings is roughly 42% of the total commercial building area and 53% of the end use consumption [4]. Although the sophistication of the BASs has grown significantly over the past two decades, many buildings still do not fully utilize the plethora of BAS capabilities. In addition, buildings are not properly commissioned, operated, or maintained, which leads to inefficient operation, increased energy use, and reduced lifetimes of the equipment. Several studies have concluded that existing building commissioning (EBCx) or Re-tuning™ of existing commercial buildings can save energy from a few percent to over 60%, with most reported savings in the range between 10% and 30% [5\u201316]. EBCx is a process to identify operational problems or best practice guidelines that could lead to energy savings [17]. Re-tuning is a systematic process to detect and diagnose operational problems and best practice sequence of operations and implement them [9,10]. Unlike EBCx, Re-tuning is narrowly focused on building systems and their controls and leverages data from BASs to identify these opportunities. Mills et al. [11] created a case-study database covering results from commissioning projects in the United States and presented the meta-analysis of published and unpublished data from 409 commissioning projects covering 643 commercial buildings (81% existing buildings, 19% new construction) across 26 states (9.2 M m2 or 99 M sf). Qualitative data was gathered regarding the reasons for commissioning in 178 existing buildings and 36 new construction buildings. Information on problems and opportunities 1 1 Although we have used the term opportunity, others in the literature also refer to them as measures. implemented to resolve them was available in roughly one third of the projects. The common problems reported were related to the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. These problems relate to operations and control, specifically scheduling equipment as a function of building occupancy (e.g., temperature setback, morning warm-up, lighting sweeps), equipment staging (e.g., chiller staging or lead\u2013lag pumping sequencing), start/stop (e.g., chiller or boiler system lockouts), and implementation of advanced reset strategies (e.g., supply-air temperature reset based on outdoor-air temperature, static pressure reset based on zone demand). The median savings from 163 projects that reported savings was 10% of the whole building energy consumption. The median cost for commissioning existing buildings was $3.93/m2 ($0.36/sf). Crowe et al. [16] added an additional 839 buildings to the previous Mills et al. study [11]. Like the previous study, the study also included both new as well as existing buildings. The study found that across all project types for existing buildings in the new sample, the median savings ranged between 3% and 16% and the median cost was $2.65/m2 ($0.26/sf), which was 33% lower than the cost associated with the original sample. The median simple payback time for existing buildings was 1.7 years; however, the EBCx costs compared to benefits can be higher for smaller buildings. Like the previous study by Mills et al. [11], this study also did not include many details on the prevalence of different opportunity types. Although both meta-studies showed significant savings and payback times of less than 2 years, the biggest impediment to widespread use of EBCx is the perception that many of the savings\u2019 opportunities implemented as part of the EBCx process do not persist. Although the data is limited, the savings tend to degrade over time and can completely vanish by the fourth year [18]. Another study [19] looked at persistence of EBCx implementation at 28 sites and reported that after six years the savings degraded to 61% of the original savings. However, the study also showed that there is significant variation in persistence from site to site. Because many opportunities addressed during the EBCx implementation relate to operational changes, those changes can be easily reverted by building operational staff for various reasons or they deteriorate over time. The most common reason for making unintended changes is to address an occupant complaint. For example, if there is complaint related to a hot call, rather than address the root cause of the problem, in many cases the building operators will override the supply set point to address the symptom which will negate the savings. To assure persistence, the building owner will have to repeat EBCx periodically, which can be expensive. Therefore, to address the cost and persistence of the EBCx process, the Re-tuning approach was developed. Unlike the traditional EBCx approach, which has a broader scope, Re-tuning primarily targets HVAC systems and their controls [9,10]. Re-tuning is a systematic process to identify and correct building operations that lead to excess energy use. These operational problems might include heating and cooling systems that are running longer than necessary, or at times when the building is unoccupied. Re-tuning also can be used to coordinate and improve operation of lights, hot water heaters, and other functions. There are over 140 different opportunities that the Re-tuning process looks for. These opportunities are discussed in the next section. The focus of Re-tuning is to identify and achieve significant energy savings at little cost; it might be thought of as a scaled-down EBCx process. The reason for deploying a scaled-down, less thorough, EBCx process is to get measurable improvements, with minimal capital investment and shorter payback periods that are more readily approved by building management. To ensure persistence, the Re-tuning process can be repeated periodically. Repeating Re-tuning can be done more cost-effectively than the EBCx process because it is less expensive. Finally, because of the vast potential savings that can be achieved in existing commercial buildings and to contribute to the mitigation of climate change, there is increased urgency to improve the operating efficiency of the existing U.S. commercial building stock. Inspired by the success of Re-tuning, many cities and states in the U.S. have passed \u201cTune-up\u201d ordinances as part of their climate change mitigation plans that require periodic \u201cTune-up\u201d of existing commercial buildings [20\u201322]. It is likely that many states and cities will follow Seattle, Philadelphia, and New York City's examples. Although the \u201cTune-ups\u201d can be effectively done using the traditional EBCx process, that process cannot scale if other cities and states also issue \u201cTune-up\u201d mandates because there are not enough trained EBCx service providers. A technology-based solution can deliver EBCx/Re-tuning service at a lower cost and will also assure the persistence of building operations because it is a continuous process. Because the Re-tuning process leverages data from the BAS, it can be fully automated and continuous to assure persistence of building operations. To develop a technology-based solution (automated Re-tuning), we first need to understand what opportunities are most prevalent in existing commercial buildings that have BASs. Unlike the two previous meta-analyses [11,16], which were based on the information from the commissioning reports, the study covered by this paper is based on BAS data collected from over 150 existing commercial buildings in the U.S. This study is a meta-analysis of BAS data from 150 buildings from which a list of commonly found Re-tuning opportunities is created. Although the building sample is not large or diverse, it provides useful information for cities and states that are creating \u201cTune-Up\u201d mandates to improve the energy performance of their commercial building stock as part of their climate change mitigation plans. First, the methodology used in conducting the meta-analysis is described in Section 2, the results are presented in Section 3, the discussion of results and how the results could be used is described in Section 4, and the summary and conclusion from the work is presented Section 5. 2 Methodology When the Re-tuning process was created, it initially targeted several opportunities. Although the focus of Re-tuning was to identify and implement opportunities that can save energy at little or no cost other than the labor required to perform it, the number of targeted opportunities increased significantly compared to the initial effort. To optimize the effort, there was a need to focus on high-value (savings) and low-effort (cost to implement) opportunities. In addition, there was impetus from many Re-tuning practitioners to develop a fully automated process of identifying Re-tuning opportunities because the Re-tuning process was semi-automated, which required visual inspection of standardized graphs to identify potential Re-tuning opportunities [9,10]. Therefore, this effort has three goals: (1) use the data collected from Re-tuning efforts, analyze that data, and identify the prevalence of various Re-tuning opportunities, (2) create a subset list of the opportunities that have high value (savings) and low effort (cost to implement), and (3) identify opportunities that can be fully automated. 2.1 Data collection Over the past decade, as part of the Re-tuning effort, we have analyzed trend-data from BASs from over 150 buildings throughout the U.S. Typically, 2 to 4 weeks of trend data was collected for analysis, which included not only weekday data from the occupied and unoccupied periods, but also weekend periods. In most cases, BAS timeseries trends were of 1-minute frequency. Some legacy BASs were not capable of trending data at 1-minute frequency, so in those cases, the data collection was either 5- or 15-minutes and a few at 30-minutes. All relevant data from air-handling units (AHUs), variable-air-volume (VAV) boxes, chillers, boilers, and other central plant systems were collected. The building operator or their control contractor would setup the trends with support from the Re-tuning researchers. In most modern BASs (less than 10 years old), setting up trends was straight forward, but on some legacy BASs that are older than 10 years old, it created some challenges. The challenges included the inability to trend at the desired 1-minute frequency or the inability to setup all the necessary trends required. More details on the points required for the various systems with sample Re-tuning charts can be found on the project website [24]. The data was typically downloaded from the BAS in comma separated variable (CSV) format for analysis. This data served the critical function of revealing the common Re-tuning opportunities that could be implemented in each of the buildings. The Energy Charting and Metrics (ECAM) tool was used to analyze the BAS trend data and identify Re-tuning opportunities [25]. ECAM is a spreadsheet tool allows for creation of building Re-tuning charts that can be used to visually identify Re-tuning opportunities present in the building. The creation of the Re-tuning charts is fully automated once the raw CSV data is mapped to predefined point names within the ECAM tool. Analyzing the time histories of operational data allowed us to identify Re-tuning opportunities that generally cannot be detected by observing operations at a single point in time or for a short period of time. The identification of opportunities included, for example, incorrect schedules, no use of set point setbacks during unoccupied periods, and poor economizer operations. 2.2 Re-tuning opportunities and Re-tuning effort The Re-tuning approach looks at over 140 different opportunities. Implementation of some opportunities can lead to significant savings, while other opportunities yield less savings. To help categorize the Re-tuning opportunities, the opportunities were grouped by systems. Further, each Re-tuning opportunity was assigned either \u201chigh,\u201d \u201cmedium,\u201d or \u201clow\u201d in terms of both the savings it would generate and the level of effort it would take to implement the measure. Classification of opportunities by the amount of savings and the level of effort is the help building operators/owners prioritize which opportunities to address if they have a constraint. Note that the savings and effort categorization was subjective based on previous modeling efforts [13], our field experience, and talking to a few EBCx providers. We are currently involved with follow-up work that is trying to conduct the categorization more systematically. The results of that effort are unfortunately not available currently for inclusion in this paper. It will be a topic of the future paper. Fig. 1 shows classification of the various Re-tuning opportunities. Over a quarter of the opportunities are associated with AHUs, zones, followed by chilled and hot-water distribution loops. There are fewer opportunities associated with BASs and domestic hot water (DHW). Fig. 2 shows the distribution of all Re-tuning opportunities based on their potential savings and grouped by the level of effort needed to implement them. The most desired opportunities are those that provide high savings and require little effort to implement. Almost 20% of the opportunities fall into that category. Slightly over 20% of the opportunities require high effort to implement, and less than 3% of the opportunities require high effort and result in low savings. Fig. 3 (a) shows the distribution of Re-tuning opportunities based on potential savings and grouped by category and (b) shows the distribution of Re-tuning opportunities based on implementation effort and grouped by category of Re-tuning opportunities. Fig. 4 shows the distribution of potential savings from Re-tuning opportunities grouped by Re-tuning category and implementation effort. Correcting many AHU, chilled and hot water, and zone opportunities will lead to high savings, and the implementation effort of these opportunities is relatively low compared to other opportunities. 2.3 Sample composition The meta-study included data from 151 buildings in the U.S. (Fig. 5 ). Some of the 151 buildings lacked certain information; therefore, when the data is analyzed, the number of buildings listed for a particular analysis could be less than 151. Although the sample size is not large, it is one of the largest samples with measured building data from BASs. The 151 buildings were spread across 36 states, with over 50% of the buildings being from 10 states. Fig. 6 shows the distribution of buildings by decade built, type, size, and number of floors. Most buildings in the sample were built after 1970, but over 25 percent of buildings were built before 1950. The sample is biased with office buildings (almost 80 percent), followed by courthouses, schools, and medical buildings. Almost 85% of the buildings were over 10,000 m2 (100,000 sf) and multi-storied. 2.4 Data analysis The BAS data from 151 buildings were analyzed using a spreadsheet tool that generated graphs for visual inspection to identify various Re-tuning opportunities. Using this information, a dataset that consisted of 151 rows (buildings) and 147 columns (opportunities) was constructed. In addition, other meta-data (such as opportunity category) were also added to the dataset as columns. If a Re-tuning opportunity was identified in a building, that information was documented in the dataset. Once the dataset was populated, it was used to conduct a detailed analysis of categories and to draw conclusions from the effort. In almost all cases, the presence of a Re-tuning opportunity identified through data analysis was confirmed during a site visit. In some cases, the site visit identified additional Re-tuning opportunities that were added to the dataset. 2.5 Energy savings calculations Of the 151 buildings, 68 of them implemented corrective actions of some or all Re-tuning opportunities that were identified. Implementation varied across the Re-tuning categories, with 60% for schedule opportunities, 50% for zone opportunities, over 40% for the AHU and hot-water opportunities, and 35% of the chilled-water opportunities implemented. Because estimation of energy savings is not the focus of this paper, only a summary of the approach is described in this section. For more details on how the energy savings were estimated refer to Fernandez et. al [14]. Energy savings are estimated at the building level. So, if multiple Re-tuning opportunities are implemented, it is not possible to assign savings to each opportunity individually. Using whole building energy consumption, energy savings are validated using a process that compares the energy consumption in the 12 months after the completion of Re-tuning implementation (post-analysis period) to the 12 months prior to the start of implementation (baseline period). The estimated savings is a whole-building energy savings that considers the change in each of the utility meters, analyzed independently. For the utility meters themselves, the specific method used to validate savings depends on data availability. When only monthly utility billing data is available, monthly linear regression model is used to estimate savings. For natural gas and steam meters, a linear regression model for the monthly EUI (kBtu/sf) is constructed as a function of the monthly heating degree days (HDD) for both the baseline and the post Re-tuning periods. For electricity, monthly EUI is calculated as function of monthly cooling degree days (CDD), unless electricity is used as the primary fuel source for heating, in which case the sum of CDD and HDD is used for the regression model. After regression models for the baseline and post periods are calculated, those models are applied to Typical Meteorological Year (TMY) data for the location of interest, to calculate the achieved annual savings. So, the savings are for a typical year rather than for any specific year. The preferred data source for calculating savings is interval metered data for each energy commodity, and when available and reliable, this source is used in lieu of the monthly billing data. The interval electricity utility data is typically hourly. A modified bin-method is used to estimate baseline electricity consumption using baseline electricity data and post-Re-tuning weather data. In this approach, electricity data at each interval in the post-Re-tuning period is compared to the baseline period by looping through each interval in the baseline period and taking a weighted average of the electricity data that was reported for the same hour of the day and day type (weekday, Saturday, or Sunday/holiday) and with outdoor air temperatures within +/- 1.67 °C (+/- 3°F) of the post-analysis interval data point. This weighted average constitutes an \u201cexpected baseline consumption.\u201d Post-implementation interval data that have no comparable matches meeting these criteria in the baseline data are ignored. Overall savings is estimated by summing the observed post-data and comparing it to the summed \u201cexpected baseline consumption\u201d values, among the full set of comparable hours. 3 Results In this section, the results of analyzing the BAS data from 151 buildings and selected highlights are presented. 3.1 Distribution of Re-tuning opportunities by vintage, building size, and building type Fig. 7 (a) shows the distribution of Re-tuning opportunities by building vintage and Re-tuning category for the sample of buildings in the meta-study. There do not seem to be any major differences in distribution of Re-tuning opportunities for each Re-tuning category across building vintage. For example, irrespective of the year the building was built, between 30% and 40% of the Re-tuning opportunities identified were associated with AHUs. Between 10% and 15% of the Re-tuning opportunities were related to each of the chilled-water distributions, hot-water distributions, schedules, or zones. Re-tuning opportunities related to lighting systems were between 4% and 8%. Similarly, there is no significant difference in the distribution of Re-tuning opportunities for each Re-tuning category across various building sizes (Fig. 7 (b)). Between 31% and 42% of the Re-tuning opportunities were related to AHUs, between 7% and 16% were related to either chilled or hot-water distribution, 13\u201317% to schedules, 9\u201315% to zones, and 4\u20137% to lighting. The only major difference was associated with envelope opportunities. About 8% of opportunities were related to envelopes for smaller buildings less than 10,000 m2 (100,000 sf), while the remaining buildings had fewer envelope opportunities. Fig. 8 shows the distribution of Re-tuning opportunities in the 151-building sample by building type. With exception to offices, courthouses, schools, and medical buildings, the rest of the building types had fewer buildings (less than3). Therefore, generalization of the trends associated with the building types that have fewer samples is not appropriate. For the four building types that had a sample size of at least 10 buildings, the difference of Re-tuning opportunities related to each of the Re-tuning categories does not appear to be significant. For example, Re-tuning opportunities related to AHUs were between 27% and 37%, chilled and hot-water distribution opportunities ranged between 9% and 15%, schedules were between 12% and 16%, between 12% and 16% were related to zones, and between 15% and 16% were related to schedules. Less than 5% of the opportunities for offices and courthouses were related to lighting, while schools and medical buildings had almost twice as many (9%). 3.2 Prevalence of AHU Re-tuning opportunities Fig. 9 shows the prevalence of AHU Re-tuning opportunities in the 151-building sample grouped by level of effort (color). The definition of the opportunity codes plotted on the x-axis. Note that the size of the bubble indicates potential savings\u2014high, medium, or low\u2014with most AHU opportunities having high or medium savings with a few low savings opportunities. Prevalence of most AHU opportunities are between 5% and 30%, with two exceptions. AHU opportunity A01 (Implement/improve duct static pressure reset) and A03 (Implement/improve discharge air temperature reset) are prevalent in over 70% of buildings. Because these two opportunities can be implemented with \u201cmedium\u201d effort with high potential savings, they should always be implemented. 3.3 Prevalence of zone Re-tuning opportunities Fig. 10 shows the prevalence of zone Re-tuning opportunities in the 151-building sample grouped by level of effort. There are several opportunities, such as Z05 (Reduce VAV minimum air flow rate for certain zones), Z08 (Widen/adjust cooling and heating set points), Z09 (Widen dead band for heating and cooling set points), and Z11 (Review and/or implement night setback for all zones), having high or medium savings that can be implemented with low effort and are prevalent in over 15% of the building sample. Most of the other zone opportunities are prevalent in less than 10 buildings. Although zone opportunities Z20 (Interlock the terminal box fan with the AHU serving it), Z21 (Switch terminal box to unoccupied mode based on occupancy sensors), and Z23 (Improve VAV box control by switching modes [VAV box heating mode, cooling only mode, etc.]), are not widely prevalent, they have high savings with low implementation effort and therefore should always be implemented. 3.4 Prevalence of schedule Re-tuning opportunities Fig. 11 shows the prevalence of schedule Re-tuning opportunities in the 151-building sample grouped by level of effort. Almost all schedule opportunities, with exception of S09 (Interlock make-up air schedules with exhaust fan schedules) and S12 (Lockout heating and cooling in boiler room based on outdoor-air temperature), have high or medium savings with low implementation effort. Because all opportunities have low implementation effort, they should always be implemented. 3.5 Prevalence of chilled and hot-water distribution Re-tuning opportunities Fig. 12 shows the prevalence of Chilled-Water Distribution Re-tuning opportunities in the 151-building sample grouped by level of effort. CO1 (Implement chilled-water supply temperature reset), C02 (Implement condenser water temperature reset), and C03 (Implement loop differential pressure reset/reduction and convert three-way valves to two-way valves if required) are present in over 30% of the 151-building sample. Because these opportunities have either medium or high savings, they should always be implemented. A number of other chilled-water distribution opportunities, although less prevalent, have high savings. Many of these opportunities have a high implementation effort as well and will require capital investment; therefore, additional analysis is generally recommended before implementing those opportunities. Fig. 13 shows the prevalence of hot-water distribution Re-tuning opportunities in the 151-building sample grouped by level of effort. HO1 (Lockout boiler and pumps or steam heat exchangers), H03 (Reset loop differential pressure), H11 (Implement/improve hot-water supply temperature reset), and H12 (Insulate all exposed hot water/steam piping, fittings, and tanks) are present in over 20% of the 151-building sample. Because these opportunities either yield high or medium savings with low or medium levels of effort, they should always be implemented. There are several opportunities with either high or medium savings, although their prevalence is low. Additional analysis may be required before deciding to implement these opportunities. 3.6 Prevalence of lighting Re-tuning opportunities Fig. 14 shows the prevalence of lighting Re-tuning opportunities in the 151-building sample grouped by level of effort. Six of the nine opportunities have over 10% prevalence in the 151-building sample (L01, L02, L03, LO4, LO5, and LO8). L01 (Install/relocate and/or validate photocell sensor(s) to control outdoor lighting) and L02 (De-lamp in areas with intensive lighting levels) both have high savings potential with a medium level of effort to implement; therefore, when these opportunities are present, they should be implemented. For other lighting opportunities, we recommend more analysis before deciding to implement them. 3.7 Prevalence of envelope Re-tuning opportunities Fig. 15 shows the prevalence of envelope Re-tuning opportunities in the 151-building sample grouped by level of effort. Three opportunities (BE02, BE03, and BE10) have over 10% prevalence in the 151-building sample. Although the savings from implementing these opportunities are low, they should be implemented because the level of effort to implement them is low. Most of the other opportunities have less than 5% prevalence in the 151-building sample. When opportunities BE12 (Adequately insulate soffits and make sure heating is disabled during cooling season) and BE14 (Seal rooftop penetrations [i.e., legacy exhaust fan hoods]) are present, they should be implemented because of savings potential and the medium level of effort needed to implement them. 3.8 Re-tuning opportunities with high potential savings In general, our recommendation is to implement any Re-tuning opportunity that has a high potential for savings and requires a low level of effort to implement (Fig. 16 (a)). These opportunities are commonly present with AHUs, chilled and hot-water distribution systems, schedules, and zones. Re-tuning opportunities that have a high savings potential and a medium level of effort should also be considered for implementation (Fig. 16 (b)). Any other opportunity that has high savings potential but requires a high level of effort to implement may require additional analysis to justify its implementation. 3.9 Top Re-tuning opportunities in the 151-building sample Fig. 17 (a) shows the top 10 Re-tuning opportunities that were present in the 151-building sample. The prevalence of the opportunities ranged between a high of 74% (A03) to a low of 32% (CO2). The prevalence of the next 10 Re-tuning opportunities ranged between 29% (Z08) and 23% (H12) (Fig. 17 (b)). Although our recommendation is to look for all possible Re-tuning opportunities when assessing a building, if the Re-tuning is being conducted manually or periodically and time is limited, our recommendation is to at least look for these 20 Re-tuning opportunities. 3.10 Savings from implementing/correcting Re-tuning opportunities About half of the buildings (69 buildings) in the 151-building sample implemented some or all the Re-tuning opportunities that were identified in those buildings. Fig. 18 shows the number of Re-tuning opportunities implemented (blue) and not implemented (red) in the 69-building subset for each Re-tuning category. Implementation varied across the Re-tuning categories, with 60% for schedule opportunities being implemented, followed by 50% of zone opportunities, over 40% of the AHU and hot-water opportunities, and 35% of chilled-water opportunities. There were only a few opportunities associated with the remaining categories (BAS, DHW, envelope, and lighting). In addition to tracking the implemented opportunities, we also compared the whole building energy consumption (electricity + gas) after implementation of the Re-tuning opportunities with prior consumption. It was not possible to measure the savings for each individual measure. The percent actual observed annual whole building energy savings and the area-normalized annual whole building energy cost savings for the 68 buildings are shown in Fig. 19 and Fig. 20 , respectively. There was wide variation in savings, ranging from 0 to 50% and 0 to 18 $/m2. The distribution of percent annual whole building energy savings and area-normalized annual cost savings for the 68-building sample are shown in Fig. 21 (a) and (b), respectively. The median percent annual whole building savings was 12%, and the median normalized annual cost savings was $1.75/m2. 4 Discussion This meta-study was conducted to document common reasons for inefficient operations and to create a list of Re-tuning opportunities that can be automatically detected by continuously analyzing data from the BAS. The prevalence of Re-tuning or EBCx opportunities was identified by analyzing trend data collected from BAS and data gathered from site visits of over 150 buildings from across the U.S. Although the size of the building sample is small and not diverse, this is the largest data source of this type that is openly available, and it provides valuable information that cities and states can use to focus the \u201cTune-Up\u201d mandates. This analysis is also useful in identifying those opportunities that can be automatically detected and those that can be automatically corrected, prioritizing them to help energy service providers and researchers interested in developing software based EBCx delivery. First, the study designated 147 Re-tuning opportunities and grouped them into nine different categories (Fig. 1). The opportunities were further classified by savings potential (high, medium, and low) when the opportunity was implemented and the level of effort required to implement the measure. In this classification, the most desirable opportunities are the ones that result in high savings with low implementation effort. Using this classification of Re-tuning opportunities, data from 151 buildings were analyzed and conclusions drawn. Although building vintage ranged from before 1950 to after 2010, the distribution of the Re-tuning opportunities identified for these buildings showed no difference between various vintages. Similarly, there is no significant difference in the distribution of Re-tuning opportunities by building size. For the four building types (office, courthouse, schools, and medical) that had at least 10 samples each, the distribution of the Re-tuning opportunities did not appear to be significantly different. This indicates that Re-tuning opportunities are not a function of building vintage or building size, but are reflective of how the buildings are operated. Because AHU opportunities A01 (Implement/improve duct static pressure reset) and A03 (Implement/improve discharge air temperature reset) are prevalent in over 70% of buildings and because implementation of these opportunities will result in high savings, any building Re-tuning efforts should look for these opportunities. A few zone opportunities (Z05, Z08, Z09, and Z11) are prevalent in over 15% of the buildings. In addition, to these opportunities Z20, Z21, and Z23 (although not widely prevalent) should also be looked at while Re-tuning a building, because they have high savings potential with low implementation effort. Almost all Re-tuning opportunities related to schedules have either high or medium savings with low implementation effort; therefore, Re-tuning efforts should always look for opportunities related to schedules. Many buildings (between 20% and 30%) lack chilled and hot-water distribution loop temperature resets and differential pressure resets. Because these opportunities typically have either medium or high savings, these opportunities should be looked at while Re-tuning a building. While other chilled and hot water opportunities yield high savings, the level of effort to implement them is also high; therefore, additional analysis should be conducted before deciding to implement those opportunities. Several lighting opportunities (LO1, LO2, LO3, LO4, L05, and LO8) are prevalent in over 10% of the buildings. L01 and L02 both have high savings potential with medium level of effort to implement; therefore, these opportunities should be investigated when Re-tuning a building. A few envelope opportunities (BE02, BE03, and BE10) have over 10% prevalence; although these opportunities have low savings, these opportunities should be looked at while Re-tuning because they can be easily implemented. 4.1 Automated identification of re-tuning opportunities The sophistication of the BASs has increased significantly over the past two decades; however, many commercial buildings do not make use of the BAS\u2019s capabilities, leading to several operational inefficiencies that increase energy consumption as much as 30%. Therefore, many cities and state are adopting \u201cTune-Up\u201d mandates as part of their climate change mitigation plans. These mandates will create significant demand for EBCx services. Meeting these mandates through traditional EBCx services will be difficult because of the lack of trained commissioning providers. Furthermore, as noted previously, traditional EBCx process can be expensive, and there is no guarantee on the persistence of building operations. Milesi-Ferretti et al. [23] provided a list of commissioning tools that were developed as part of the International Energy Agency\u2019s Annex 47. However, the scope of these tools appears to be limited and not widely available. Therefore, more work is needed in the development of automated tools that will support EBCx. Table 8 lists the Re-tuning opportunities for each of the three use cases (automatic identification, automatic correction, and Tune-up mandates) grouped by Re-tuning category. As noted previously, several Re-tuning opportunities can be automatically identified by systematically analyzing the data from the BASs. If data required to identify an opportunity exists in the BAS and can be automatically retrieved, then algorithms can be developed to automatically identify the opportunity. Preliminary work to develop these algorithms has already been initiated [26]; however, more work is needed. Automation of EBCx services will not only lower the cost but also assure continuous persistence of building operations. Although automated identification of opportunities can increase the awareness of building operators, owners, and HVAC service providers to the presence of an opportunity in HVAC systems and equipment, information alone does not correct or implement these opportunities. Action is required to correct the opportunity and improve operational efficiency. Some of these opportunities such as incorrect set points, improper values, lack of reset of temperatures and pressures based on zone conditions, incorrect implementation of control strategies, poor use of equipment scheduling, and others can be automatically corrected or implemented. Automated correction further lowers the cost of EBCx. An example of such an opportunity is lack of static pressure reset (A01). When an AHU is detected without a static pressure reset and if the conclusion, based on the analysis of the data, is that static pressure reset would be beneficial, it can be automatically corrected or implemented through supervisory commands to the BAS. If an opportunity is found and if it can be automatically corrected or implemented through existing BAS, then those opportunities are classified for the second use case (automated correction, column 3 in Table 8). Preliminary work on automated correction has been reported by Katipamula et. al [27,28,29] and Fernandez et. al [30]. Again, more work is still needed to reduce it to practice. The list of opportunities under the final use case (Tune-up Mandate, column 4 in Table 8)., can be used by cities and states to focus the Tune-up mandates. This set of opportunities have been selected because they result in \u201cmedium\u201d or \u201chigh\u201d savings when the opportunities exist and are corrected. As stated previously the potential savings and implementation effort categorization was subjective based on previous modeling efforts [12], our field experience, and talking to a few EBCx providers. We are currently involved with follow-up work that is trying to conduct the categorization of savings and effort, more systematically. 5 Conclusions and future work Based on published literature and analysis of the BAS data from the 151-building survey, we can conclude that the state of current building operations is poor and results in as much as 30% excess energy consumption. Although it has been shown that significant savings can be realized from building commissioning, only a small fraction of new buildings and an even smaller fraction of existing buildings are commissioned. The authors of this study strongly believe that there are two major reasons for this predicament: (1) perception that commissioning is expensive and that the rate of return is small, and (2) the corrections implemented during the commissioning process do not last beyond a few months. Fortunately, the software based EBCx process can significantly reduce this excess energy consumption, lower the cost of the service, and assure continuous persistence of building operations. However, large-scale realization of this savings potential requires automated tools to identify and correct the operational problems. In addition, broader adoption of Tune-up mandates will also assure more efficient commercial building stock. Future work will be focused on automating the identification of the Re-tuning opportunities by continuously analyzing the data from the BAS. Beyond identification, the work will also involve creating supervisory algorithms that can automatically implement some of the Re-tuning opportunities. As existing buildings are decarbonized and new buildings become net-zero energy, assuring \u201coptimal\u201d operation of building systems becomes more critical because operating utility reserves are going to be limited.

        "dc:description": "In the United States, as much as 30% of the 19 EJ that commercial buildings consume is considered excess. Much of the excess energy is due to the inability to manage building operations efficiently. Because almost 20% of the total primary energy consumption is associated with commercial buildings, significant energy reductions in this sector are needed to mitigate climate change. Therefore, many cities and states are mandating periodic \u201ctune-ups\u201d of these buildings to eliminate excess energy consumption. Although the benefits of tune-ups and retro-commissioning are clear, focusing these mandates to look for specific opportunities has been a challenge because of the lack of studies that document the prevalence of opportunities. Therefore, we analyzed building automation system data from 151 buildings across the United States to document common operational problems and opportunities to improve building operations. This analysis showed that opportunities to improve building operations exist in almost every building. These opportunities were not strongly correlated with building vintage or size, but were reflective of how the buildings are operated. The prevalence of the top 20 opportunities ranged between 74% and 23%, with 40% of these associated with air-handling units. The rest of the opportunities are associated with schedules, chilled and hot-water distribution, and zone controls. Of the 151 buildings, 69 of them implemented corrective actions of some or all opportunities that were identified. Implementation varied across the Re-tuning categories, with 60% for schedule opportunities, 50% for zone opportunities, over 40% for the air-handling unit and hot-water opportunities, and 35% of the chilled-water opportunities. There was wide variation in whole building energy savings, ranging from 0 to 50% and 0 to 18 $/m2 with median percent annual whole building savings of 12% and median normalized annual cost savings of $1.75/m2. In addition to documenting these key findings, the paper provides a list of opportunities that can be automatically and continuously identified and corrected and offers a list of those opportunities that should be the focus of the mandates.",
