Good energy performance is very important for decreasing the consumption of energy-intensive buildings. This paper studies a new multi-objective evolutionary approach to optimize the building energy performance. Firstly, the problem is modeled as two-objective optimization functions, i.e., minimizing the energy consumption and maximizing the comfort level. Next, a new solving algorithm based on bare-bones particle swarm optimization is developed. In the algorithm, an improved update strategy with adaptive perturbation is proposed to overcome the disadvantage of easily local convergence of the traditional algorithm. The algorithm deletes control parameters including inertia weight and acceleration coefficients from the traditional algorithm, showing the advantage of easy-to-use. Applying the proposed algorithm into several buildings located in China, experiment result shows that the proposed algorithm can obtain good non-dominated solutions, which is obviously better than that of those compared algorithms. The uncomfortable hours of the proposed algorithm on part cases reduce 11.82%, but its energy consumption only increases 1.74%. All indicate that the proposed algorithm is a powerful tool for optimizing building energy preference. Keywords Building energy performance Multi-objective optimization Particle swarm EnergyPlus 1 Introduction Energy is the core of economic and social activities in the world. As energy consumption increases continuously, reducing energy consumption has become more and more important [1\u20133]. The building and construction are energy-intensive, accounting for about 40% of the total energy consumption. According to reports of the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 57% of the energy consumption comes from heating, ventilation, air conditioning and lighting. Some researches show that households and buildings are major contributors to the emission of greenhouse gases and global warming [4]. In order to save building energy and reduce pollution emissions, more and more researchers pay attention to zero energy/emission buildings (ZEB). The primary objective of ZEB is to reduce energy consumption and increase renewable energy production to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) [5]. Among them, improving the energy efficiency of buildings has become one of international problems [6]. Because of the lack of effective simulation tools, early studies focus mainly on the prediction of building energy consumption, and don\u2019t give reasonable optimization strategies. Liu et al. [7] revised the ASHRAE standard by analyzing 21000 data sets of 160 buildings in different climate zones around the world, and given an adaptive model of natural ventilation buildings. White et al. [8] used monthly average temperatures to predict building energy consumption. This method does not need to run complex building procedures, and can obtain better prediction results than the standard method based on the number of heating and cooling days. Yao and Steemers [9] used specific modeling methods to model each component of residential renewable energy system, and gave a simple method to predict daily energy consumption. Yik et al. [10] used a simulation tool to obtain cooling load data of different buildings, and proposed a cooling load model of buildings. In recent years, simulation-based optimization approach for building energy performance gets a lot of attention with the development of energy simulation software. Among them, dynamic energy simulation is nowadays normal practices, and steady-state is not even allowed in some countries. Considering the minimum building energy consumption, Junghans et al. [11] studied a building optimization algorithm with genetic algorithm for the life cycle cost problem in building energy conservation. Scott and Vasken [12] proposed a distributed evolutionary optimization technology for community energy integrated systems, which consider both architectural design and regional energy utilization technologies. Bamdad et al. [13] applied an ant colony optimization algorithm in the energy consumption optimization of Australian commercial buildings. Yang et al. [14] proposed a distributed parallel genetic algorithm framework to overcome the time-consuming shortcomings of stochastic algorithms in dealing with complex building energy consumption problems. By using evolutionary technologies with global search capability, these methods obviously improve the quality of building energy optimization results. However, most of them treat the optimization problem of building energy performance as a single-objective optimization one. Building energy performance optimization is a typical multi-objective problem. It includes at least two objectives, i.e., the users\u2019 comfort level and the consumption of energy [15\u201317]. A multi-objective optimization approach can obtain a set of Pareto optimal solutions, meeting the needs of different decision makers [18]. Focused on this, Delgarm et al. [15] studied a NSGA-II based multi-objective evolutionary method for lighting and cooling energy consumption in buildings. Bre and Fachinotti [19] successfully applied NSGA-II in the optimal design of residential buildings. For the problem of building renovation cost, Ascione et al. [20] proposed a multi-stage cost optimization analysis framework by combining multi-objective evolutionary algorithm and artificial neural network. Delgarm et al. [21] presented a multi-objective artificial bee colony method to obtain the optimal configuration parameters of building envelope. Considering thermal light energy, discomfort and useful daylight illumination, Zhang et al. [16] introduced an improved multi-objective method with enhanced Pareto evolutionary algorithm (SPEA2) for optimizing the classroom structure parameters. In order to ensure the normal operation of the power system, Chemezov et al. [22] proposed an algorithm for power system operation, Ferrara et al. [23] proposed an integrated design automation model. Gabrielli [24] proposed optimal design of multi energy systems with seasonal storage. Ogedengbe et al. designed a new architectural energy audit software using the development framework, and proposed the multi-objective functions for the optimization of different energy stock [25]. Elin and Farivar [26] proposed a NSGA-II-based multi-objective optimization technique to unearth the optimal type and location of PCM in order to minimize heating and cooling loads. Ascione et al. [27] developed a new comprehensive framework for the multi-objective optimization of building energy design, called Harlequin. Harlequin implements the optimization of energy design by genetic algorithm and smart sampling, and experimental results on typical new Italian offices show its effectiveness. Facundo et al. [28] coupled the multi-objective NSGA-II with artificial neural network, and proposed an efficient method to solve building performance optimization problems, where ANN-based metamodel is used to model the optimized problem. Recently, Hashempour et al. [29] comprehensively summarized existing approaches on building energy performance optimization problems, according to their decision-making model, measures and variables, objectives and criteria, software tools, optimization methods, etc. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a relatively new evolutionary algorithm (EA), which is originated from the foraging behavior of birds in the natural world [30]. Compared with traditional EAs including genetic algorithm, PSO shows the advantages of fast convergence and easy implement, and has been applied in many practical problems [31\u201333]. However, few researchers apply it in the problem of building energy optimization. Recently Delgarm [6] applied a multi-objective PSO algorithm to the building performance design considering refrigeration, heating and lighting energy consumption. These methods above provide a lot of effective ways to solve the optimization problem of building energy performance. However, most of them still suffer from the following disadvantages: 1) Tending to fall into local convergence or having slow convergence because of the lack of powerful global exploitation. Analyzing the above aforementioned studies, most of them directly introduce existing evolutionary algorithms such as NSGA-II to deal with this kind of problem. Due to the lack of problem-oriented search operators, their search performance is limited. 2) Being sensitive to the setting of control parameters, such as inertia weights and acceleration coefficients. For a given optimization model, they need users repeatedly adjust these control parameters for obtaining optimal solutions. This obviously limits their operability and practicability in the process of optimizing building energy performance. In view of this, this paper proposes a powerful PSO-based multi-objective method for optimizing the building energy performance. An improved multi-objective PSO algorithm with less control parameters is proposed and combined with EnergyPlus for improving the energy performance of buildings. A preliminary version of this algorithm has been published by a conference [34]. In this paper, we improve the previous work in the following directions: 1) Proposing a PSO-based optimization platform for the building energy preference design. The improved update strategy with adaptive perturbation is proposed to improve the performance of the proposed algorithm; 2) Giving the detailed steps of implementing the proposed algorithm; 3) Extending the experiments to verify the performance of the proposed algorithm. Beside single room buildings located in Beijing and Xuzhou, multiple room buildings are modeled and used. The primary contributions of this study are as follows: 1) A new bare-bones PSO based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (BBMOPSO-A) is proposed. This algorithm deletes control parameters including inertia weight, learning factor and velocity, which overcomes the disadvantage that the algorithm is sensitive to control parameters; 2) An improved update strategy with adaptive perturbation is proposed to overcome the disadvantage of easily local convergence of the traditional PSO algorithm; 3) By integrating BBMOPSO-A into the software EnergyPlus, a PSO-based simulation platform for optimizing the building energy preference is established and successfully applied to several typical buildings in China. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 builds the multi-objective model of building energy performance optimization; Section 3 develops the proposed PSO-based multi-objective approach; Section 4 introduces the PSO-based simulation platform; Section 5 applies the proposed method in two cases and compares it with three representational algorithms. Finally, Section 6 concludes this paper. 2 Multi-objective optimization model of building energy performance Energy consumption (EC) and discomfort level (DL) are two main objectives which must be considered in building energy saving design. Usually, reducing building energy consumption would decrease user\u2019s comfort level, so the two objectives conflict with each other. Considering the two objectives, this section gives the optimization model of building energy performance. In this paper, we adopt the user uncomfortable hours to evaluate the discomfort level. The number of uncomfortable hours refers to the total occupation time that does not meet the acceptable limit of adaptive comfort of relevant personnel. These acceptable limits of users can be found in ASHRAE standard 55 and CEN-15251. ASHRAE Standard 55 sets the air temperature range that most people are satisfied on the basis of PMV thermal comfort model. Engineers can directly get the number of uncomfortable hours by using EnergyPlus. On the one hand, there are many factors affecting building energy consumption, such as lighting, domestic hot water, heating or cooling, and other electrical equipment. These factors have coupling relationship, and the influence degrees of part factors on building energy consumption are also depend on climate. Therefore, it is difficult for decision makers to establish an accurate mathematical model for building energy consumption. On the other hand, it is difficult to guarantee the practicability of the built model because those influence factors vary with buildings\u2019 type or climate. In order to simplify the modeling process and ensure the accuracy and practicability of building model, researchers have developed different building design software, among which EnergyPlus is the most representative and widely used one. In view of this, we establish a multi-objective optimization model by using the EnergyPlus software. Specifically, the model consists of decision variables relevant to building energy performance, i.e., the equipment power density x e p d , the building orientation x o r , the Wall solar absorptance, x s r a r , the length and height of window, x w l and x w h , the heat transfer coefficient of glass (Glass u-factor), x g h t c , the solar heat gain coefficient x s h g c , the heating and cooling setpoint for air conditioning system, x h s t and x c s t , the thickness of insulation layer outside wall x t o l w , the lighting power density, x l p d . After setting these decision variables for a building, EnergyPlus is ran to calculate the annual energy consumption of this building and the user uncomfortable hours in a year. So their calculation results are the values of the two objective functions, EC and DL. Based on this, we can describe the problem of optimizing building energy performance, as follows: (1) min F = ( E C ( X ) , D L ( X ) ) s . t . X = ( x e p d , x o r , x s r a r , x w l , x w h , x g h t c , x s h g c , x h s t , x c s t , x t o l w , x l p d ) Note that, the above optimized variables are not the only choice for users, and these variables are not suitable for all types of buildings. Under the above optimization model, users can set different decision variables to be optimized according to their own needs. Unlike a single objective optimization problem, the above multi-objective optimization model contains two conflicting objective functions. Therefore, in this paper we use the concept of Pareto dominance to evaluate the quality of solution [35,36]. Pareto dominance: For a given solution X = ( x 1 , x 2 , ⋯ , x M ) , we say that it dominates a solution X \u2032 = ( x 1 \u2032 , x 2 \u2032 , ⋯ , x M \u2032 ) , if and only if (2) ∀ i ∈ { 1,2 , .... M } , f i ( X ) ≤ f i ( X \u2032 ) a n d ∃ i ∈ { 1,2 , .... M } , f i ( X ) ≤ f i ( X \u2032 ) And it's written down as X ≺ X \u2032 . Where f i ( X ) is the i-th objective of the problem. For a multi-objective optimization problem F ( X ) with feasible region F , a solution X ∗ ∈ F is Pareto optimal if there is not any solution X ∈ F satisfying X ≺ X ∗ . Furthermore, all Pareto optimal solutions constitute a set of Pareto optimal solutions. The purpose of the multi-objective approach proposed below is to find a set of Pareto optimal solutions with good convergence and distribution for the problem (1). 3 The proposed multi-objective approach based on bare-bones PSO This section develops a novel PSO-based multi-objective approach to solve the model described by Eq. (1). Firstly, the traditional PSO algorithm is introduced. Secondly, an effective bare-bones multi-objective PSO method with adaptive perturbation (BMOPSO-A) are proposed to overcome the shortcoming that traditional PSO algorithms is more sensitive to control parameters. 3.1 Traditional particle swarm optimization PSO is originated from foraging behavior of birds in the natural world. In PSO, each particle updates its position based on two best positions. One is the optimal position found by the particle itself, i.e. the personal leader, and another is the optimal position found by its neighbors so far, i.e. the global leader. For a particle X i = ( x i , 1 , x i , 2 , ⋯ , x i , n ) , suppose its global leader is G b = ( g b 1 , g b 2 , ⋯ , g b n ) and its personal leader is P b i = ( p b i , 1 , p b i , 2 , ⋯ , p b i , n ) , this particle is updated as follows: (3) v i , j ( t + 1 ) = w v i , j ( t ) + c 1 r 1 ( p b i , j ( t ) − x i , j ( t ) ) + c 2 r 2 ( g b j ( t ) − x i , j ( t ) ) (4) x i , j ( t + 1 ) = x i , j ( t ) + v i , j ( t + 1 ) Where, w is the inertia weight, c 1 and c 2 are two acceleration coefficients; t is the iteration time, r 1 and r 2 are two random numbers within [0, 1]. 3.2 The proposed BBMOPSO-A algorithm Since needing to adjust constantly inertia weight and acceleration coefficients for obtaining ideal solutions, traditional PSO algorithms have the disadvantage of being sensitive to control parameters. Our previous work has developed an improved multi-objective PSO (BBMOPSO) [37] to overcome the above disadvantage. BMOPSO gave the following update formula: (5) x i , j ( t + 1 ) = { N ( r 3 × P b i , j ( t ) + ( 1 − r 3 ) × G b i , j ( t ) 2 , | P b i , j ( t ) − G b i , j ( t ) | ) , if U ( 0, 1 ) < 0.5 G b i , j ( t ) , otherwise Where N ( a , b ) is a Gaussian distribution function with the mean a and the variance b; r 3 is a random number in [0, 1]; U ( 0,1 ) represents a random number with uniform distribution between [0, 1]. We can see from the above equation that BBMOPSO does not need the inertia weight and acceleration coefficients. So it is control-parameter-free. However, we can see by analyzing Eq. (5) that: if the global leader G b i and the personal leader P b i are very close, i.e. | P b i , j ( t ) − G b i , j ( t ) | ≈ 0 , the sampling result of N ( a , b ) will be close to or equal to G b i ; furthermore, the new particle position generated by Eq. (5) will be close to or equal to G b i . Meanwhile, since G b i was the optimal solution found by the swarm so far, repeatedly searching such regions will results in the waste of computing resource. Aimed at the disadvantage above, we propose an improved update strategy with adaptive perturbation: (6) x i , j ( t + 1 ) = { N ( r 3 × P b i , j ( t ) + ( 1 − r 3 ) × G b i , j ( t ) 2 , | P b i , j ( t ) − G b i , j ( t ) | + δ j ) , if U ( 0, 1 ) < 0.5 G b i , j ( t ) , otherwise (7) δ j = { ( x j u p − x j l o w ) × e ( − 5 t / T ) , p h > r a n d 0 , o t h e r w i s e (8) p h = 1 2 ( 1 − 1 M ∑ m = 1 M | f m ( P b i ( t ) ) − f m ( G b i ( t ) ) f m max − f m min | ) Where t is the current iteration time, T is the maximal iteration time. x j l o w and x j u p are the lower and upper limits of the j-th variable; f m max and f m min are the maximal and minimal values of the m-th objective function obtained by the swarm; δ j is a disturbance factor determined by the similarity between G b i and P b i , and it decreases with the decrease of iteration time; p h is a probability determined by the difference between f m ( G b i ( t ) ) and f m ( P b i ( t ) ) . It can be seen from the above update strategy: (1) the closer the personal leader P b i and the global leader G b i are, the smaller the value of | f m ( G b i ( t ) ) − f m ( P b i ( t ) ) | is, so the larger the probability value p h is. Furthermore, the higher the feasibility of the disturbance factor δ j takes the value of ( x j u p − x j l o w ) × e ( − 5 t / T ) , the greater the possibility that the new position generated by formula (6) jumps out of the region of G b i , and the greater the probability that the particle will find a new optimal solution; (2) In the initial stage of the algorithm, due to a small value of t, the value ( x j u p − x j l o w ) × e ( − 5 t / T ) is large; accordingly, the disturbance range of selected particle is large. Therefore, the proposed adaptive perturbation factor can improve the global exploration ability of the swarm in the initial stage of the algorithm. As the iteration time increases, the disturbance range of selected particle gradually reduces, so the algorithm will have good local exploitation capability in the later stage of the algorithm. Based on the above work, we describe the proposed multi-objective PSO algorithm (BBMOPSO-A), as follows: Step 1 Set related parameters, including the size of swarm N, the maximal iteration time T. Step 2 Initialization. Randomly initialize the positions of N particles, set the personal leader of each particle, P b i = X i , i = 1,2 , ⋯ , N . Let the archive Ar to be an empty set. Specific to the problem studied in this paper, the value ranges of decision variables can be determined in advance by the structure of the building, material properties or equipment model. Step 3 Calculate the objective values of each particle. Write the variable values of each particle into the software EnergyPlus, and then run the software to obtain two objective values, namely the annual energy consumption of building and the number of uncomfortable hours within one year. Step 4 Update the archive of the algorithm. First, combine the existing solutions in the archive with the new solutions generated into a new set. Next, use the Pareto dominance relationship to select non-dominated solutions from the new set, and replace original solutions in the archive by these non-dominated solutions. Here, if the number of solutions in the archive exceeds its maximum capacity, Na, calculate the crowded distance value of each solution by the method in Ref. [34], and Na solutions having a large crowded distance value are retained [38]. Step 5 Update the personal leader of each particle. For each particle, if its old personal leader is dominated by its new position, the new position is set to be the personal leader of this particle; otherwise, keep the personal leader unchanged. Step 6 Select the global leader of each particle from the archive. First, randomly select two elements from the archive, and calculate their crowed distance values by the method in Ref. [34]; then, set such element with a large distance value as the global leader of the current particle. Repeat the above method until all particles have their leaders. Step 7 Generate a new position for each particle by using Eq. (6), and return to Step 3. Step 8 Determine whether the maximal iteration time T is reached. If yes, stop the algorithm and output the solutions saved in the archive; otherwise, return to Step 6. 4The BBMOPSO-A based simulation platform for building energy preference We establish the simulation platform by coupling BBMOPSO-A with EnergyPlus. This platform uses EnergyPlus to simulate the building energy consumption behavior, and adopts MATLAB to implement the BBMOPSO-A algorithm. The specific method is as follows: after the BBMOPSO-A algorithm generates a new solution or particle, firstly the new particle is passed into EnergyPlus system by an interface program; then, the relevant system parameters in EnergyPlus are reset by the received particle, and the EnergyPlus starts to run the building energy consumption simulation system and outputs two performance values, i.e., the building energy consumption and the uncomfortable hours. After that, the two performance values are feed backed to the BBMOPSO-A algorithm running in MATLAB, and set to be the objective function values of the new particle. In view of the strong ability to process text, Visual C is used to build the communication interface between MATLAB and EnergyPlus. Specifically, the function of interface program with C language is to bring new generated decision variables into the model and form a new model. When new decision variables are generated by MATLAB, the interface program puts these decision variables into a file and transforms them into special strings. Using those special strings, a new model will be obtained. After brining the model into EnergyPlus for calculation, a new objective function value will be obtained. In this way, we can combine any evolution optimization algorithm with EnergyPlus to deal with the building energy problem. Furthermore, Fig. 1 shows the specific implementation of the simulation platform combining Visual C++, MATLAB and EnergyPlus. Firstly, according to users\u2019 needs, we use the software SketchUp to draw the 3D model of a designated building, and add the materials, lighting system, air conditioning system and other components to the model in the EnergyPlus system through the plug-in Legacy Openstudio. Secondly, the BBMOPSO-A algorithm in Matlab is run to generate new particles or solutions. Next, the Visual C++ based interface program is employed to embed new solutions into EnergyPlus one by one, and EnergyPlus is run to output the performance indicator values of each solution. After that, MATLAB reads the obtained performance values as the objective function values of new solutions. If the termination condition of the algorithm is not reached, re-run the BBMOPSO-A in MATLAB to generate new particles, and cycle the above steps until the algorithm stops. Finally, all the Pareto optimal solutions saved in the archive are the final results of the problem. This platform is convenient for common professionals to operate. In general, users need give the general outline of optimized building and select parameters to be optimized, then they will get optimal solutions by running the platform. If users also understand the PSO algorithm, they can get better solutions by setting the best PSO parameters. Of course, they can also use default PSO parameters. 5 Application cases This experiment applies the proposed method in the design of two kinds of buildings. One is a single-room office. We use the SketchUp to create the architectural shape of this office, and Fig. 2 shows the base style of the office. The length, width and height of this model are 8.8 m, 3.6 m and 3.9 m. The initial length and height of window are 1.7 m and 1.6 m, respectively. The office adopts embedded lighting. Referring to the \u201cInput Output Reference\u201d in the EnergyPlus software manual, we set its return air volume coefficient to 0, the emissivity coefficient to 0.37, and the visible light coefficient to 0.18. The lighting density is 9 W per square meter. According to China's \"Public Building Energy Efficiency Design Standards\" [39], Tables 1 and 2 give the information about the enclosure structure of the windows and walls of the office room. We consider the following decision variables: the equipment power density, the building orientation, the wall solar absorptance, the length and height of window, the heat transfer coefficient of glass (Glass u-factor), the solar heat gain coefficient, the heating and cooling setpoint for air conditioning system, the thickness of insulation layer outside wall, the lighting power density. Table 3 gives the ranges of these decision variables. Another case is a four-room family house. Fig. 3 shows the base style of the house. We consider the following 19 decision variables: the building orientation, the wall solar absorptance, the length and height of the four windows, the heat transfer coefficient of glass (Glass u-factor), the solar heat gain coefficient, the heating and cooling setpoint for air conditioning system, the thickness of insulation layer outside wall, the lighting power density. To fully illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithm. We study the energy performance of the two buildings at two different cities. One is Beijing in the cold regions of China. Beijing is the capital of China, located at a latitude of 39.80 N, longitude 116.47E. Another is Xuzhou in the hot summer and cold winter regions of China, and Xuzhou is the location of the author's work unit. It is located at latitude of 34.28 N and longitude of 117.15E, which belongs to the hot summer and cold winter regions. 6 Experiments and analyses 6.1 Comparison algorithm and performance index Three typical multi-objective methods for building energy performance are selected as compared algorithms. They are NSGA-II-based algorithm (NSGA-II) in Ref. [15], multi-objective artificial bee colony based algorithm (MOABC) in Ref. [21], and multi-objective PSO-based algorithm (MOPSO) in Ref. [6]. For a fair comparison, we set the size of population or swarm N = 50 and the maximum iteration time T = 20 for all the four algorithms. We set other parameters for the four comparison algorithms according to the recommendations in their corresponding literature. Table 4 lists the detailed parameters for these algorithms. Hyper-volume measure (HV) [40,41] is used to evaluate the performance of an algorithm. Compared with other measures in multi-objective optimization, such as IGD, HV does not need the true Pareto front of the problem. More of all, HV can evaluate the distribution and convergence of a set of solutions simultaneously. For a set of solutions, if its distribution and (or) convergence become well, its HV value must increase. Considering a set of solutions obtained by an algorithm, its HV value is the volume of the area enclosed by these solutions and a reference point. Typically, the reference point consists of the worst results for each objective function in obtained solutions. Moreover, the SC measure [40] is chosen to compare the convergence between the two algorithms. This measure is mainly used to calculate the proportion of elements in set B that are dominant by elements in set A. Let A and B be two solution sets, the SC measure can be calculated as follows: (9) SC ( A , B ) = | { b ∈ B : ∃ a ∈ A , a ≺ b } | | B | where, | B | represents the number of solutions in B. Obviously, when SC ( A , B ) = 1 , all the solutions in the set B are dominated by A; and when SC ( A , B ) = 0 , any solution in B is not dominated by A. 6.2 The compromise solution In this paper, we can obtain a set of Pareto optimal solutions by using the proposed algorithm. Among the solution set, all the solutions don\u2019t dominate each other, or are not superior to each other. A decision-maker can select satisfactory solution from the set according to own needs. Moreover, we also give a fuzzy decision method to help decision-makers select a compromise solution from the set of optimal solutions. Considering a non-dominated solution X k in the set of optimal solution SET, the satisfactory degree of decision-maker to its i-th objective value can be represented by a membership function defined as (10) μ i k = { 1 , f i ( X k ) ≤ f i min , f i max − f i ( X k ) f i max − f i min , f i min < f i ( X k ) < f i max , 0 , f i ( X k ) ≥ f i max . Where f i max and f i min are the maximum and minimum of the i-th objective function. Then, the normalized membership function μ k of X k is calculated as, (11) μ k = ∑ i = 1 M μ i k ∑ k = 1 | S E T | ∑ i = 1 M μ i k Where M is the number of objective functions. | S E T | is the number of elements in the set SET. The compromise solution is the solution with the highest μ k value in SET. 6.3 Comparison results 6.3.1 Case 1: the single-room office in Beijing Running the four algorithms (BBMOPSO-A, NSGA-II, MOABC and MOPSO) on this case 20 times respectively, Table 5 lists their HV values. The t-test with a significance level of 0.05 is used to characterize the significant difference between different algorithms. Among them, \"R+\" indicates that BBMOPSO-A is significantly better than other algorithm. \" = \" means that the performance of the two algorithms is equivalent, and \"--\" means that the comparison is meaningless. Table 6 shows the SC values obtained by the four algorithms. Furthermore, Fig. 4 shows the Pareto optimal fronts achieve by the four algorithms. (1) Comparing with MOPSO, BBMOPSO-A and MOABC, NSGA-II has the worst HV value in terms of both the average and the standard deviation. The solutions obtained by BBMOPSO-A show the best convergence which is significantly better than NSGA-II. As showed in Table 6, we have S C ( B B M O P S O - A , N S G A - I I ) = 1 and S C ( N S G A - I I , B B M O P S O - A ) = 0 . Moreover, the Pareto fronts in Fig. 4 indicate that MOABC and MOPSO have better convergence than NSGA-II. (2) Among the four algorithms, MOABC has the smallest standard deviation in terms of HV, but its average is significantly worse than BBMOPS0-A. Furthermore, as showed in Table 6, we have S C ( B B M O P S O - A , M O A B C ) = 0.3061 and S C ( M O A B C , B B M O P S O - A ) = 0.1333 . This means that BBMOPSO-A dominates 30.61% solution of MOABC, but the ratio of solutions of MOABC dominated by BBMOPSO-A is only 13.33%. So, the convergence of BBMOPSO-A is better than that of MOABC. (3) BBMOPSO-A has significantly better HV value than MOPSO. As showed in Table 6, we have S C ( B B M O P S O - A , M O P S O ) = 0.3696 and S C ( M O P S O , B B M O P S O - A ) = 0.0867 . This means that BBMOPSO-A dominates 36.96% solution of MOPSO, but the ratio of solutions of MOPSO dominated by BBMOPSO-A is only 8.67%. This indicates that the convergence of BBMOPS0-A is better than that of MOPSO. Furthermore, the optimal Pareto fronts of the two algorithms shown in Fig. 4 confirm this conclusion. So, the performance of BBMOPSO-A is also significantly better than MOPSO. Furthermore, Table 7 shows the Table Compromise solutions obtained by the four algorithms in the single-room office at Beijing. It reports that the proposed algorithm has he smallest uncomfortable hours (462.00) by using less energy consumption (7.61), while the uncomfortable hours of NSGA-II, MOPSO and MOABC are 886.00, 524.50 and 1381.50, respectively. The uncomfortable hours of the proposed algorithm reduce 11.82%, but its energy consumption only increases 1.74%. 6.3.2 Case 2: the single-room office in Xuzhou Running the four algorithms on the single-room office in Xuzhou 20 times, Tables 8 and 9 show their HV and SC values in the case, and Table 10 shows their compromise solutions. Fig. 5 shows Pareto optimal fronts obtained by the four algorithms. (1) Comparing with the NSGA-II algorithm, BBMOPSO-A has significantly better performance with respect to HV. This is mainly due to the excellent convergence of BBMOPS0-A. Furthermore, as their SC measures show, BBMOPSO-A dominates all solutions of NSGA-II, but no solution in NSGA-II is dominated by BBMOPSO-A. The good convergence of BBMOPS0-A significantly increases its HV value. In addition, the Pareto fronts in Fig. 5 show that the convergence of NSGA-II is also significantly worse than MOABC and MOPSO. (2) Comparing with MOABC and MOPSO, BBMOPSO-A also obtains better average HV value, which is significantly better than MOABC and MOPSO. At the same time, it can be seen from their SC values that BBMOPSO-A dominates 31.5% solution of MOABC and 61.33% solution of MOPSO. In contrast, the ratios that the solutions of MOABC and MOPSO are dominated by BBMOPSO-A are 18.0% and 11.33%, respectively. This indicates that the convergence of BBMOPS0-A is better than that of MOABC and MOPSO. Furthermore, the optimal Pareto fronts of the two algorithms shown in Fig. 5 confirm this conclusion. Therefore, the overall performance of BBMOPSO-A is also significantly better than MOABC and MOPSO. (3) Compared with the three compared algorithms, BBMOPSO-A has the smallest energy consumption (7.76) with the second smallest uncomfortable hours (813.75). Although MOPSO obtains the smallest uncomfortable hours (259.50) its energy consumption (9.10) is far more than BBMOPSO-A. 6.3.3 Case 3: the multi-room house in Beijing Running the four algorithms on the multi-room house in Beijing 20 times, Tables 11 and 12 show their HV and SC values in the case, and Table 13 shows their compromise solutions. Fig. 6 shows Pareto optimal fronts obtained by the four algorithms. It reports that: (1) BBMOPSO-A has larger HV than NSGA-II. The solutions obtained by BBMOPSO-A dominate all the solutions of NGSA-II, while the proportion that the solutions of NSGA-II dominates the solutions of BBMOPSO-A still is 0. MOABC also obtains good solutions close to the solution obtained by BBMOPSO-A, but its running time is much longer than BBMOPSO-A because the need of continuously searching in the surrounding range. (2) Compared with the three compared algorithms, BBMOPSO-A has the smallest uncomfortable hours (2525.30) with the second smallest energy consumption (45.90). MOABC has similar objective values with BBMOPSO-A, where its energy consumption and uncomfortable hours are (45.80, 2526.70). NSGA-II achieves the worst energy consumption and uncomfortable hours. 6.4 Comparison with BBMOPSO In this paper, an improved particle update strategy based on adaptive perturbation is proposed to improve the search ability of BBMOPSO-A. This section aims to verify the effectiveness of the proposed update strategy by comparing with the previous update strategy in BBMOPSO. BBMOPSO-A and BBMOPSO set the same parameters as showed in Section 6.1, Tables 14-17 show the HV and SC values obtained by the two algorithms for the two cases with single-room, respectively. It can be seen that with the help of the improved particle update strategy, BBMOPSO-A obtains significantly better HV value than BBMOPSO, and the convergence of its solutions has significant improvement compared with BBMOPSO. Taking the case of office room in Xuzhou as example, BBMOPSO-A dominates 61.33% solution of BBMOPSO; on the contrary, BBMOPSO dominates the solutions of BBBOPSO-A with a ratio of only 11.32%. 7 Conclusions This paper proposed a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, BBMOPSO-A, to deal with the optimization problem of building energy performance. By integrating BBMOPSO-A into EnergyPlus, a simulation platform for building energy performance design was also established. On the one hand, compared with traditional particle swarm optimization algorithms, the proposed algorithm deletes control parameters including inertia weight, learning factor and velocity, and shows the advantage of easy-to-use. On the other hand, the proposed particle update strategy with adaptive perturbation not only overcomes the disadvantage of the traditional algorithm, but also effectively balances the global and local search capabilities of the swarm. Moreover, the introduced fuzzy decision method can help decision-makers select a good compromise solution from the set of Pareto optimal solutions. The experimental results on several single- or multi-room buildings located a in China show that: 1) the proposed algorithm obtained a set of Pareto optimal solutions with good convergence and distribution. Its values on hyper-volume measure are obviously better than that of selected typical methods; 2) the proposed algorithm found good compromise solutions for all the three test cases. Take the first case (the office in Beijing) as example, the proposed algorithm has the smallest uncomfortable hours (462.00) by using less energy consumption (7.61), while the uncomfortable hours of NSGA-II, MOPSO and MOABC are 886.00, 524.50 and 1381.50, respectively. Overall the proposed BBMOPSO-A is a new powerful and useful tool for optimizing building energy preference. Because of needing use the software EnergyPlus to evaluate the fitness of individuals, all existing evolutionary-based building energy optimization methods including our proposed method have the shortcoming of high computational cost. How to use machine learning or parallel computing technology to reduce the computational time is our future work.

        "dc:description": "Good energy performance is very important for decreasing the consumption of energy-intensive buildings. This paper studies a new multi-objective evolutionary approach to optimize the building energy performance. Firstly, the problem is modeled as two-objective optimization functions, i.e., minimizing the energy consumption and maximizing the comfort level. Next, a new solving algorithm based on bare-bones particle swarm optimization is developed. In the algorithm, an improved update strategy with adaptive perturbation is proposed to overcome the disadvantage of easily local convergence of the traditional algorithm. The algorithm deletes control parameters including inertia weight and acceleration coefficients from the traditional algorithm, showing the advantage of easy-to-use. Applying the proposed algorithm into several buildings located in China, experiment result shows that the proposed algorithm can obtain good non-dominated solutions, which is obviously better than that of those compared algorithms. The uncomfortable hours of the proposed algorithm on part cases reduce 11.82%, but its energy consumption only increases 1.74%. All indicate that the proposed algorithm is a powerful tool for optimizing building energy preference.",
