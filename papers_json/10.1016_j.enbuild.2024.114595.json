Several studies have highlighted the thermal comfort challenges associated with occupancy-centric control (OCC) when occupants first arrive, despite OCC demonstrating energy savings potential in buildings. To address this challenge, a geofence-based OCC (Geo-OCC), where the virtual boundary of the occupant\u2019s physical location is infused into the smart thermostat, is explored to pre-condition buildings, aiming to alleviate thermal discomfort. This research adopted an apples-to-apples field testing approach to quantify how Geo-OCC impacts the thermal comfort and energy consumption of the heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) system in two 1,200 ft2 lab homes located in Texas, USA. These two homes were designed and built as identically as they could be. Two side-by-side experimental scenarios were designed to compare different control strategies through integrations with smart thermostats. In scenario 1, Geo-OCC was implemented in the east home, while a baseline case without OCC (Non-OCC) was executed in the west home. In scenario 2, Geo-OCC was employed in the east home, and a traditional OCC based on occupancy presence sensors (Sensed-OCC) was implemented in the west home, demonstrating Geo-OCC\u2019s ability to alleviate thermal discomfort. The field-testing results of scenario 1 suggested that Geo-OCC achieved a 46.41 % reduction in heating energy consumption compared to Non-OCC over the testing duration of 25 days, resulting in a maximum unmet degree (UD) of 3.83 °C in a 5-minute sampling frequency, in contrast to a maximum UD of 0.83 °C in Non-OCC mode. The results from the field testing in scenario 2 indicated that Geo-OCC reduced the maximum UD to 1.94 °C in a 5-minute sampling frequency, compared to 2.28 °C in Sensed-OCC, without an increase in heating energy consumption. The results of the scenario 1 experiment suggested the OCC decreased the HVAC energy consumption while having a slightly adverse effect on thermal comfort during occupied periods, especially upon the first arrival of occupants. The field testing of scenario 2 exhibited the capability of Geo-OCC to enhance thermal comfort with minor effects on the HVAC energy consumption. In addition, Geo-OCC displayed the potential to reduce the peak demand increase caused by traditional Sensed-OCC.

In residential buildings, 32.1 % of electricity energy was allocated for space heating and cooling [1], highlighting the significant role of Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems in electricity consumption. Human behavior has considerable effects on the energy performance of buildings [2\u20134]. Conventional HVAC controls rely on fixed or steady-periodic setpoints and schedules, which are commonly designed for peak occupancy density, regardless of the actual real-time occupancy status [5]. Therefore, advanced HVAC controls, including occupancy-centric control (OCC), have seen increasing interest in their capability to improve building energy efficiency. The significant rise of diverse smart building products and the progression of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies are facilitating an enhanced capability for remote monitoring, optimization, and control of HVAC systems within buildings, providing an opportunity to embed real-time occupancy information from sensing technologies to the HVAC control system. In recent years, numerous studies have investigated the effectiveness of OCC in buildings, with most finding significant energy savings from both field tests and simulations [6\u201314]. OCC refers to control strategies that incorporate the sensing of indoor environmental quality and the various occupant behaviors [15]. This strategy reduces unnecessary energy usage by adapting building system operation schedules and setpoints in response to real-time occupant behaviors [16,17]. For instance, Pang et al. [12] incorporated occupancy presence sensors into a smart thermostat in a residential apartment and built an inverse data-driven model based on field-measured data, demonstrating approximately 15.1 % energy saving in cooling energy consumption compared with the baseline of constant setpoints. Jiang et al. [18] leveraged real-time data from occupant-counting sensors to address energy wastage issues in a medium-sized office building. Compared with a data-driven baseline model, the occupant-counting-informed control achieved a decrease in heating load ranging from 4 % to 11.2 % and a reduction in cooling load ranging from 3.6 % to 6.5 % for the open workspace. Meanwhile, the implementation of OCC using occupancy sensors only could potentially lead to thermal comfort issues for occupants upon arrival to a previously unoccupied space due to sensor error, communication delay, network latency, and a time lag in response to control signals [12,16,18]. To solve the thermal comfort issues, occupancy-centric control based on geofence is proposed and implemented in this study. Geofencing is the process of creating a virtual boundary around a specific geographic location. In contrast to the typical occupancy presence sensor-based HVAC control (Sensed-OCC), which updates occupancy information only after detecting occupants through sensors, the occupancy information in the geofence-based occupancy-centric control (Geo-OCC) is updated upon occupants entering the geofenced area, leading to a pre-condition effect. An extensive literature review of sensed occupancy-centric control and geofencing technologies is presented in Section 1.1 and Section 1.2, respectively, followed by the identification of research gaps and the objectives of this paper. 1.1 Literature review of Sensed-OCC for HVAC systems in buildings 1.1.1 Occupancy sensing Occupancy-centric control utilizes the occupancy data (e.g., presence status or the count of occupants) to regulate HVAC operations effectively, aiming to save energy while providing an acceptable indoor environment. A large number of methods have been developed for the detection and estimation of building occupancy, including passive infrared (PIR) sensors, environmental sensors (e.g., CO2 sensors), Wi-Fi, cameras, and other electricity sensors and meters [19]. The occupancy sensors can be mainly categorized into image-based sensors, motion sensors, radio-based sensors, and threshold and mechanical sensors [20]. The image-based sensors utilize electromagnetic radiation techniques or computer vision techniques to process images, obtaining the presence, number and trajectory, identity, or location of occupancy [19,20]. Motion sensors encompass passive infrared (PIR) sensors, ultrasonic dopplers, photo sensors, and microwave dopplers. PIR sensors detect motion and heat radiating from a person's body and are commonly used in buildings where occupancy changes frequently. Because of the low cost, PIR sensors are widely used in smart thermostats commercially, including those produced by Ecobee, Nest and Honeywell. Ultrasonic sensors rely on sound waves to detect motion and are well-suited for areas where occupants remain seated or stationary for prolonged periods, which are the cases when PIR sensors have low detection accuracies. Radio-based sensors employ radio signals to gather occupancy-related data, including location, count, identity, and movement. Technologies utilizing radio signals for occupancy detection encompass radio frequency identification (RFID), Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, global positioning system (GPS), and ultra-wideband (UWB). Threshold and mechanical sensors detect the presence of occupancy by sensing interaction of occupants at entrances, such as swiping cards to enter or stepping across a piezoelectric mat. Common examples of threshold and mechanical sensors comprise reed contacts, door badges, piezoelectric mats, and IR beams [20]. 1.1.2 Occupancy-centric control strategies Based on the occupancy information types, the occupancy-centric control can be categorized as occupancy presence sensor-based control and occupancy counting sensor-based control. PIR sensors are the most widely used occupancy presence sensors in coordination with HVAC systems to determine the building occupancy. However, one application limitation of these sensors is their inability to determine the precise occupancy number, and instead they just determine whether the space is occupied or not [21,22]. Presence sensors are much cheaper and more commercially available compared with occupancy counting sensors. Although the cost for the production and installation of occupancy counting sensors is far more than that of occupancy presence sensors, occupancy counting does allow for the fine-tuning of both energy savings and zone temperature for occupants following standards and codes (e.g., ASHRAE 90.1 and 62.1). Occupancy counting can allow for precise adjustments of temperature and airflow based on the number of occupants in a given space, thus maintaining a good indoor environmental quality and being energy-efficient [14]. The OCC can be classified into reactive and predictive control in terms of control framework [17]. Reactive control operates the HVAC system based on real-time occupancy information from the sensor-based monitoring system in the building. The performance of reactive controls is heavily dependent on occupancy detection and sensor networks. However, the most commonly used occupancy sensors (e.g., PIR) are limited in their ability to determine the occupancy precisely and can lead to thermal discomfort for occupants due to their poor accuracy (e.g., high false negative rate) and response time. Occupancy sensors placed too high or too low may not detect occupants accurately, leading to false readings and much poorer performance in terms of energy savings and thermal comfort [16,17]. The lag time associated with the sensor networks and HVAC system to reach the desired setpoint temperature is another limitation of reactive control [18,23]. Predictive control utilizes occupancy models to gain insight into forthcoming occupancy statuses. Nonetheless, predicting occupancy behavior within a building is challenging due to the inherently stochastic nature of occupants, as well as the computational cost and memory demands involved [24]. For example, a short-presence-detection model requires 12 min to complete recognition, complicating its integration into local controllers [25]. A few experimental studies of OCC have integrated occupant behavior information into model-based predictive controls, with reactive control remaining the most prevalent control framework in the OCC field [24,26]. 1.2 Literature review of geolocation and geofencing technologies Geolocation tracking and geofencing are important technologies that are widely used in many industries, including the building industry. Geolocation enables tracking and monitoring of the location of Point of Interest (PoI), e.g., vehicles, assets, and employees, in real-time, allowing for improved efficiency, safety, and productivity. Geolocation-based control systems can use a diverse set of techniques to determine the location of occupants within a building, including GPS, Bluetooth, RFID, and Wi-Fi. These sensors can be integrated with building automation systems to adjust lighting, HVAC, and other building systems based on the location of occupants. Li et al. [27] studied demand-driven HVAC operations by detecting and tracking multiple stationary and mobile occupants in multiple spaces within a building with an RFID-based system. Vosughi et al. [28] proposed catered controls for HVAC systems, reacting to the changing location of an occupant simulated by a Markov jump-linear system model. Geofencing is a technology that uses GPS or other geolocation technologies to define virtual boundaries around a physical location [29,30]. This boundary can be created using GPS or other location-based technologies and then be used to trigger specific actions or alerts when a PoI enters or exits the designated area. Geofencing is commonly used in industries such as transportation, logistics, and construction to track the location of vehicles and assets and monitor their movement in and out of specific areas [31]. Geofencing has been implemented in several fields. One such example is to create a larger reliability to record and report the clinical work hours which is limited to 80 h per week for graduate medical students, and residents during residency training [32]. The application of geofencing resulted in a reduction in average hours violations from 11 h to 4.5 h and an increase in the overall submissions rate of work hour reports from 82 % to 85 % within a program comprising 23 residents [32]. For the application in the HVAC field, Liu et al. [33] investigated a tracking cooling fan that provides personal cooling services using geofence and camera-based indoor localizations. Zafari et al. [29] and Natarajan et al. [30] introduced a concept suggesting turning on the HVAC equipment before occupants' arrival to enhance thermal comfort using geofencing information. One significant limitation of geolocation and geofencing is the concern about privacy [34]. The use of geolocation data raises issues pertaining to data privacy, security, and ownership. Additionally, the potential for hackers to access geolocational data for malicious purposes is a growing concern [35]. 1.3 1.3. Research gaps Despite numerous research on OCC, there remain unsolved problems: 1) Although some studies proposed predictive control, the thermal comfort issues for occupants upon arrival after the implementation of OCC are still unsolved [12,16,18]. 2) Some scholars have proposed integrating geofencing with OCC. Additionally, some residential thermostat manufacturers offer models equipped with geofencing, such as [36,37]. However, to the best of the authors' knowledge, no research has conducted a side-by-side comparison field testing to quantify the improvements in thermal comfort and the effects on energy consumption of geofence-based OCC in HVAC applications. 3) When quantifying the energy saving of OCC, most studies compared the energy consumption of OCC with a simulated baseline or baseline control in similar outdoor conditions. More precise and reliable results can be obtained if a side-by-side experiment can be conducted. 1.4 Objectives and contributions The objective of this study is to determine the effectiveness of geofence-based occupancy-centric control (Geo-OCC) methods in terms of energy efficiency and thermal comfort compared with the standard HVAC operation without occupancy-centric control (Non-OCC), and typical occupancy-centric control based on occupant sensors (Sensed-OCC). This study introduced an apples-to-apples field testing approach in the Texas A&M Smart and Connected Homes Testbed (TAM-SCHT) located in Bryan, TX, USA, featuring an office occupancy schedule. The first apples-to-apples field testing, referred to as scenario 1, compared the Geo-OCC with Non-OCC, aiming to demonstrate the influence of the application of occupancy-centric control (OCC). In the second paired field test, denoted as scenario 2, the comparison involved Geo-OCC against Sensed-OCC, aiming to illustrate the influences of integrating geolocation and geofencing into building occupancy-based control methodologies. Geo-OCC integrated a geofencing-based system that uses the location of occupants to adjust the temperature setpoints accordingly, representing a novel and emerging area of research. In this study, GPS-based geofencing was implemented, utilizing the Google Maps Application Programming Interface (API) to provide longitudinal and latitudinal coordinates of the smart homes. These coordinates were used to create a geofence surrounding the specified location. This geofence was then utilized in conjunction with the occupant\u2019s geolocation to determine the operation of the HVAC system in the testbed. The field testing was conducted in 2 laboratory homes that were designed and built as identically as they could be to replicate real-world home environments. The experimenter simulated the occupant by arriving at the lab home in the morning and departing from the lab home in the afternoon with smartphones, which will trigger the geolocation and geofencing system to implement the Geo-OCC. Data analysis, utilizing statistical methodologies and comparative evaluations, was applied to the field-measured data to assess the influence of the proposed Geo-OCC on energy consumption and thermal comfort. The advantages of Geo-OCC include: 1) Similar to the traditional sensor-based OCC, Geo-OCC helps to reduce energy consumption in buildings, leading to cost savings and lower carbon emissions, while maintaining a better indoor environment compared with traditional OCC. 2) Geofence technologies show better accuracy than most occupancy sensors. Turley et al. [38] even used occupancy data collected by a geofence application as the ground truth. 3) The initial cost of implementing wireless geofence technologies could be lower than having physical occupancy sensors because the location data can be accessed through most smart phones, eliminating the need for additional sensors or devices to be installed. The contributions of this research are as follows: 1) This research conducted a side-by-side field testing of comparison of Geo-OCC and Non-OCC, Geo-OCC and Sensed-OCC. Field implementations demonstrated the effectiveness of Geo-OCC in terms of energy savings and thermal comfort, paving the way for future applications of Geo-OCC in building energy systems. 2) Precise experimental comparison results are presented by implementing different HVAC control strategies in two twin smart and connected homes under the same weather conditions and occupancy patterns. The remainder of this paper is outlined as follows. Section 2 illustrates the methodology employed in this study such as the control strategy, and the experimental settings of different scenarios. Section 3 introduces the setup of field testing in this case study, such as the layout plan, sensing plan and construction of smart and connected homes, hardware implementation and testing schedules. Section 4 presents and discusses the field-testing results in terms of thermal comfort, energy consumption of the HVAC system and peak load. Section 5 concludes the research, summarizes the limitations and provides the potential future research direction. 2 Methodology The methodology section introduces the implementation of Geo-OCC utilizing the Google Maps Geolocation API and geofencing for HVAC control. It demonstrates the effectiveness of Geo-OCC by comparing it with Non-OCC and Sensed-OCC through field testing in two twin smart and connected homes. The detailed field deployment will be covered in Section 3. 2.1 Experiment design To investigate the impact on HVAC energy consumption and thermal comfort of Geo-OCC, two pairs of side-by-side experiments were designed to compare the Geo-OCC with Non-OCC and Sensed-OCC. Two highly similar smart and connected homes were utilized to conduct the side-by-side experiment, as shown in Fig. 1 . These two homes were designed and built as identically as they could be. The home one was designated for the Geo-OCC experiment, while the home two was utilized for Non-OCC or Sensed-OCC configurations. In test scenario 1, the objective was to contrast the energy efficiency and zone temperature between Geo-OCC and Non-OCC in two twin smart and connected homes. The first test scenario sought to showcase the Geo-OCC's potential to enhance energy efficiency while maintaining acceptable indoor thermal comfort. Non-OCC utilized a fixed temperature setpoint as a baseline case. Test scenario 2 consists of a comparison between the Geo-OCC and Sensed-OCC in the two homes. The contradistinctive experiment in scenario 2 was conducted to verify the enhancement of indoor thermal comfort and quantify the effect on energy consumption of Geo-OCC compared with traditional Sensed-OCC. The Sensed-OCC was deployed through smart thermostat systems that integrate occupancy presence sensors, such as Ecobee [39]. However, the PIR sensors used by those commercial smart thermostats are notorious for low accuracy for stationary occupants, which introduces sensor errors. While increasing the density or coverage of occupancy sensors can enhance sensor reliability, this approach may not always be feasible due to cost considerations, in particular for U.S. homes which have one occupant sensor embedded with the smart thermostat. In this study, to remove the impact of such sensor errors, Sensed-OCC involved manually adjusting the occupancy setpoints upon arrival at the lab homes by the experimenter, alongside implementing a temperature setback of 3.3 °C (6 °F) upon departure, through the smart thermostat API. The two homes shared the same occupancy schedules and temperature setback strategies. The only difference was that Geo-OCC triggered the occupied settings upon the occupant entering the geofence and deployed the unoccupied temperature setback after leaving the geofence. 2.2 Geofencing and control strategy 2.2.1 Geofencing settings The Google Maps Geolocation API was utilized to collect the geolocation of the occupant. The geolocation API tracks the real-time location of the occupant in terms of latitude and longitude by their phone. It leverages Wi-Fi points, Cellular Towers, and the phone\u2019s unique MAC address to ping and collect the real-time latitude and longitude. The absolute distance between the lab home and the occupant is calculated by Equation (1). The constant values 60 and 54.6 in Equation (1) serve to convert the latitude and longitude into nautical miles (nm) for the purpose of comparing the distances with land miles. Longitude lines get closer to each other as they move from the equator towards the poles. This variation leads to a decrease of 60 nm per degree of longitude to 54.6 nm per degree of longitude for the approximate position of the southern United States region. (1) D i s t a n c e [ n m ] = L a t l a b h o m e s - L a t o c c u p a n t 2 60 + L n g l a b h o m e s - L n g o c c u p a n t 2 54.6 The radius of the geofence significantly affects the pre-conditioning time before arriving home, impacting both energy savings and thermal comfort. Therefore, there is a trade-off between pre-conditioning time and thermal comfort upon arrival. Additionally, a larger radius might cause the control system to register the home as \u201coccupied\u201d when the occupant is nearby for activities like grocery shopping. Consequently, the geofence radius should be adjusted on a case-by-case basis. Some commercial products allow users to define the geofence radius. For instance, the geofence feature on Ecobee defaults to 1000 m (0.62 miles) but can be reduced to as low as 100 m [37]. In this study, the experimenter's primary residence and activity area were situated near the main campus of Texas A&M University, approximately 10.6 miles from the testbed. Considering the rural nature of the testbed and to avoid inadvertent triggering of the \u201coccupied\u201d mode, a geofence with a 5-mile radius centered around the lab home was established through a preliminary testing to ensure sufficient time for pre-conditioning the lab home. The distance calculated by Equation (1) is used to compare against 4.345 nm to properly generate a 5-mile (land mile) geofence, determining the occupied or unoccupied status in Geo-OCC. The 5-mile radius was utilized to preheat or precool the lab home before the actual entry of the occupant, leading to an improvement of thermal comfort with a minor impact on energy consumption. The detailed geofence setup in this field test will be illustrated in Section 3. 2.2.2 OCC strategy: Temperature setback and smart thermostat The deployment of the Geo-OCC strategy was facilitated through the utilization of Ecobee smart thermostats [40]. It enables remote adjustment of temperature setpoints using its Python API known as pyecobee. Except for the temperature setpoint, the Ecobee applied a heating/cooling differential temperature (also known as swing temperature) to set a minimum temperature difference before engaging in heating or cooling [41] to prevent the HVAC system from short cycling and help conserve energy. If the indoor air temperature falls below the heating setpoint minus the heating differential temperature, the heating mode will be activated. Conversely, if the temperature exceeds the cooling setpoint plus the cooling differential temperature, the cooling mode will be activated. When the temperature falls within the range of the heating and cooling setpoints, the air conditioner will be deactivated. The whole control process of Geo-OCC is shown in Fig. 2 , where the dashed arrows represent the wireless transmission of data or signal. The geolocation was used as the input of the controller to determine the occupant status i.e., whether the occupant is in the geofence or not. The remote controller retrieved the geolocation information by Google Maps Geolocation API [42]. A Raspberry Pi served as a controller and determined to set the temperature setpoint to a normal setpoint or a setback according to the occupancy status. The control interval is every 5 min to prevent short cycles of the HVAC system. The detailed control logic will be introduced in Section 2.2.3. The output of the controller was cooling and heating temperature setpoints. It was transmitted to the Ecobee smart thermostat via pyecobee [43], the Python API provided by Ecobee. Then Ecobee applied the heating and cooling setpoint and controlled the operation of the HVAC system according to the temperature setpoint and the real-time indoor air temperature. One fundamental principle for setting the thermostat is to guarantee the occupant's thermal comfort during their presence. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) recommends setting back the thermostat when the occupant is asleep or away from home [44]. The setback temperature plays a crucial role in energy savings. Deep setbacks typically result in greater energy savings. A comprehensive EnergyPlus simulation across 40 representative U.S. cities and various building energy code versions found that an 8 °C (14.4°F) setback could yield an additional 5 % to 10 % savings compared to a 4 °C (7.2°F) setback, depending on the local climate [14]. The U.S. Energy Star Program recommends a 3.89 °C (7 °F) setback for cooling when the household is unoccupied [45]. However, a deep setback during unoccupied hours may lead to thermal comfort issues, particularly when occupants first arrive home. A field test conducted in an apartment implemented an 8 °C (14.4°F) setback, resulting in approximately 15.1 % cooling energy savings during the testing period but negatively affected occupant thermal comfort and indoor air quality, with indoor temperatures about 1 °C (1.8°F) higher than the baseline at certain times [12]. Another field test used a 3.4 °C (6°F) setback within the setpoint range but still encountered thermal comfort issues due to system noise and miss sensing [18]. Considering the relatively short pre-conditioning time of Geo-OCC, this study adopted a moderate temperature setback of 3.3 °C (6°F) to reduce energy costs with minimal effects on thermal comfort. The temperature setpoints of 25.6 °C (78 °F) for cooling and 22.2 °C (72 °F) for heating were utilized during occupied time in OCC mode. Specifically, for Non-OCC cases, the temperature setpoints were always 25.6 °C (78 °F) for cooling and 22.2 °C (72 °F) for heating. In OCC cases, the temperature setpoint for cooling was 25.6 °C (78 °F), which sets up to 28.9 °C (84 °F) when outside of the geofence in Geo-OCC mode or outside of homes in Sensed-OCC mode. Additionally, the heating temperature setpoint was 22.2 °C (72 °F) and was set back to 18.9 °C (66 °F) when occupant is outside of the geofence in Geo-OCC mode or not sensed by the presence sensors in Sensed-OCC mode, as illustrated in Fig. 3 . As mentioned before, the cooling/heating differential temperatures were adopted as indicated by the action temperatures (dashed lines) in Fig. 3. The HVAC system will be activated solely when the temperature surpasses the upper dashed lines or falls below the lower dashed lines. 2.2.3 Control logic and workflow The Geo-OCC logic for collecting data, determining the thermostat, and transmitting the control signal to the HVAC system is depicted in Fig. 4 . The control logic was implemented using Python. As mentioned before, the data and signal transmitting were wireless utilizing Google Maps Geolocation API and Ecobee API. In this control workflow, first, the authorization and token for Ecobee API need to be retrieved and validated in the remote controller. Next, the controller will request the latitude and longitude of the occupant by tracking the occupant\u2019s smartphone via Google Maps Geolocation API. The occupant's status will be identified by calculating the distance between the lab home implementing Geo-OCC and the occupant, subsequently comparing it with the geofence area. Finally, the temperature setpoint will be determined and updated with Ecobee smart thermostats according to the logic mentioned in Section 2.2.2 and be transmitted to the Ecobee smart thermostat via pyecobee. 2.3 Data collection from Ecobee and eGauge To quantify the potential influence on energy consumption and thermal comfort of OCC, the indoor air temperature, outdoor air temperature, temperature setpoints and HVAC energy consumption for the two lab homes were collected. The indoor and outdoor air temperatures were resourced from the Ecobee smart thermostat and smart sensors. The only energy resource of the lab home was electricity supplied by the electric grid. The electricity consumptions of each electrical end user in the home (e.g., lighting, refrigerator, and air conditioner) were measured by eGauge [46]. 3 Case study 3.1 Testing site The Texas A&M Smart and Connected Homes Testbed (TAM-SCHT) was utilized to conduct the apples-to-apples comparison between Geo-OCC and Non-OCC, as well as between Geo-OCC and Sensed-OCC. The two lab homes, which were designed and built as identically as they could be, are located on Texas A&M University, RELLS campus in Bryan, Texas, United States. This location falls within the International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) climate zone 2A, characterized by hot and humid summers with high cooling loads and mild winters with moderate heating demands. The location and exterior view of lab homes are shown in Fig. 5 [47]. Each home is one story, about 111 m2 (1200 ft2) with 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. The envelope of lab homes consists of walls with R19 insulation, R40 ceiling with double pitched roof, and floor with R11 insulation. Each lab home is equipped with an 8.79 kW (2.5-ton/15 SEER) direct expansion (DX) AC unit for space cooling and a 10.55 kW electric heating furnace for space heating. The supply airflow rate of the HVAC system is constant so that the HVAC system maintains zone temperature by on\u2013off control. The detailed floor plan, sensor plan and construction information were reported in [47]. The east home was used for Geo-OCC deployments, while the west home was selected for Non-OCC and Sensed-OCC scenarios. For testing convenience in this research facility, the experimenter (i.e., occupant) will arrive home in the morning and depart in the afternoon, similar to an office schedule. The experimenter did not enter either home during the testing period to ensure that both homes had the same internal heat gain. Hence, for Sensed-OCC scenarios, when the experimenter arrived, the smart thermostat setpoints were immediately changed to those used for the occupied mode through the API, assuming perfect occupancy presence sensors. The temperature setpoints were adjusted based on the occupancy control logic previously defined in Section 2. 3.2 Geofence implementation As described by Section 2.2.1, a 5-mile geofence was designed to pre-condition the space in Geo-OCC. The geofence was centered on the east lab home mentioned in Section 3.1 as shown by Fig. 6 . During the experiment, an experimenter went to the testbed in the morning and left in the afternoon to trigger occupant scenarios. The geolocation of the experimenter was tracked by the smartphone carried with the experimenter via Google Maps Geolocation API. The experimenter's residence and regular workplace were located outside the geofence to prevent inadvertent entry into the geofenced area. In the Geo-OCC configuration, detection of the experimenter's location within the 5-mile geofence triggers an occupied mode, or a temperature setback of 3.3 °C (6 °F) is implemented. 3.3 Hardware implementation As described by Section 2.2.2, all transmissions of signals were wireless via APIs. A Raspberry Pi 4 Model B, serving as a remote controller was placed in the experimenter\u2019s home. Accurate and timely data collection and transmission is crucial when implementing control strategies like Geo-OCC. The remote controller leveraged the advantage of the dynamic Geolocation API of Google Maps and the Developer API of Ecobee to achieve seamless data transmission. Ecobee smart thermostat and associated smart sensors, and eGauge meters were installed in the two lab homes. For energy data collection at the lab homes, an eGauge power meter was installed on the main power lines along with the individual circuits within the circuit breaker. This setup enabled the tracking of power consumption not only for the whole building but also for individual appliances and utilities within each smart home, facilitating the acquisition of HVAC system power consumption. Fig. 7 (a) and (b) show the eGauge wiring setup for the testbed. This power metering data was collected using LabVIEW [48] on a desktop computer installed at each of the smart homes. The temperature and humidity were measured by Ecobee smart thermostat and smart sensors. The smart thermostat was placed in the living room while one smart sensor was in one bedroom. The average value obtained by these two sensors was utilized for HVAC control and thermal comfort analysis. The Ecobee temperature sensor has a ± 1 °F (0.56 °C) accuracy [49]. The sample interval and control interval were every 5 min. The installation of Ecobee smart thermostat and sensor is shown in Fig. 7 (c) and (d). The temperature data was directly downloaded from the Ecobee webserver HomeIQ page, including temperature setpoint, HVAC status (e.g., cooling/heating on/off), indoor temperature, humidity, occupancy presence and outdoor air temperature. 3.4 Testing schedule Prior to the field comparison of different control strategies, the two lab homes were tested under a typical heating operation. The similarity of the two lab homes was verified using the data collected from December 23rd, 2022, to December 28th, 2022. The side-by-side comparison between Geo-OCC and Non-OCC marked as scenario 1 was conducted from February 22nd to March 22nd, 2023. The apples-to-apples comparison between Geo-OCC and Sensed-OCC, referred to as scenario 2, was conducted from March 25th to April 2nd, 2023. However, Wi-Fi connection issues and other irregular activities occurred in lab homes during the testing period. To ensure a fair comparison, temperature and power data on these irregular days were discarded. In the end, 25 days of data for scenario 1 and seven days of data for scenario 2 were valid and utilized for the result analysis. The occupancy pattern used in this experiment mimicked a typical office schedule. During the experiment period, the experimenter worked at the lab home instead of at their regular office. The occupancy patterns are visualized in Fig. 8 (a) and (b) for scenario 1 and scenario 2, respectively. The light blue indicates the occupied period while the dark blue represents the unoccupied period. The building was typically unoccupied on the weekend. It should be noted that the dates in Fig. 8 (a) and (b) are not continuous since some irregular days are excluded from the testing period. 4 Results and discussions 4.1 Verification of the similarity of two homes This study aims to quantify the effect of Geo-OCC on energy saving and thermal comfort. The energy consumption and thermal comfort under Geo-OCC were compared with those under Non-OCC and Sensed-OCC through two side-by-side experiments conducted in the two homes from TAM-SCHT. To ensure a fair comparison of different control algorithms, it is critical to verify that the behaviors of the two lab homes closely match each other in terms of building dynamics, building load, and HVAC equipment performance. A one-week verification test was conducted in December 2022. The two homes were conditioned under the same heating operation using the electric furnace from December 23rd, 2022, to December 28th, 2022. Zone air temperatures and HVAC power consumption are two metrics used for the comparison. The indoor air temperature is the average 5-minute measurement from two Ecobee sensors described in Section 3.3. Fig. 9 (a) shows the distributions of indoor air temperature of the two homes in a 5-minute interval during the verification testing period. The black dots inside the violin plot represent measurements every 5 min. The east home and west home shared a similar temperature distribution which has a peak density at about 22 °C. Table 1 gives a statistical description of 5-minute and hourly indoor air temperature in the two homes. The hourly mean, standard deviation, minimum, 25 %, 50 %, 75 % and maximum values of temperature differences in the two homes were within 0.5 °C. The average temperature variance in a 5-minute and an hourly interval was 0.26 °C and 0.07 °C respectively. Given the temperature sensor\u2019s accuracy of ± 0.56 °C (1 °F), the building dynamics, in terms of room air temperatures, in the two homes exhibited a high degree of similarity. The hourly distributions of the HVAC power consumption in the two homes are generally the same as depicted in Fig. 9 (b). Their peak density occurs at 0 kWh due to the on\u2013off control of the HVAC system, resulting from indoor air temperatures meeting the setpoints during specific hours. It should be noted that the violin plot automatically estimated kernel density, resulting in the appearance of negative power consumption in Fig. 9 (b). However, the minimum measured power consumption was 0 kWh. Another high density of HVAC power consumption was at around 11 kWh when the heater was on. On most days, the daily total HVAC power consumption differences were about 1 kWh. Table 2 summarizes the statistical description of HVAC power consumption in the two homes. The hourly and daily average power consumption variance was 0.52 kWh (18.0 % of the hourly average HVAC power consumption in the east home) and 1.16 kWh (1.8 % of the daily average HVAC power consumption in the east home), respectively. In general, the indoor air temperatures and HVAC power consumption were closely aligned in the two lab homes. 4.2 Thermal comfort This subsection compares the thermal comforts under the two experimental scenarios. The unmet degree (UD) in a 5-minute interval and cumulative unmet degree hours (UDH) [50] are adopted as the metrics to evaluate thermal comfort. The UD is defined in Equation (2). T i is the indoor air temperature in every 5 min, T s p , c is the cooling temperature setpoint, and T s p , h is the heating temperature setpoint. The UDH is calculated by Equation (3), which is the cumulation of UD. The UD indicates the instantaneous extent to which the indoor air temperature exceeds the cooling setpoint or falls below the heating setpoint, while UDH denotes both the magnitude and duration of UD. U n m e t D e g r e e U D = m a x ( ( T i - T s p , c ) , 0 ) + m a x ( ( T s p , h - T i ) , 0 ) (2). U n m e t D e g r e e H o u r ( U D H ) = ∑ ( U D ∗ H o u r ) (3). 4.2.1 Thermal comfort in scenario 1 The dataset utilized for the analysis in scenario 1 comprises the 5-minute temperature records for both Geo-OCC and Non-OCC spanning 25 days, totaling 123 occupied hours. In scenario 1, the occupancy status was marked as occupied once the occupant entered the geofence instead of entering the homes. So, the comparison of experimental results for Geo-OCC and Non-OCC only represents thermal comfort between the typical OCC and Non-OCC. Fig. 10 (a) shows the heatmap illustrating the average UDs for Geo-OCC and Non-OCC during occupied and unoccupied periods in each 5-minute interval throughout the day. In Fig. 10 (a), the x-axis is the time in a day, and the 4 rows in the y-axis represent the occupied and unoccupied states in Geo-OCC and Non-OCC modes. The testing period was heating dominant, so the heating temperature setpoint in each mode is marked on the y-axis. A redder color indicates a higher UD. Overall, the UD in the Geo-OCC mode was higher than that in the Non-OCC mode during the occupied period. The highest UD was observed upon the first arrival of occupants in Geo-OCC mode. There is a lag in response caused by the thermal mass of the building envelope. In a typical OCC setup, the temperature setpoint adjusts to a setback mode when the building is unoccupied and returns to a normal setpoint when occupied. Nevertheless, the indoor air temperature will not immediately attain the setpoint, resulting in a considerable UD during this duration. The UD during unoccupied periods in the Geo-OCC was notably lesser compared to that in the Non-OCC, mainly due to the setback feature, i.e., the heating setpoint (STP, H) was set back to 18.9 °C instead of a normal setpoint of 22.2 °C, incorporated within the Geo-OCC. Lower UD values and decreased HVAC energy consumption were anticipated when utilizing a lower heating temperature setpoint during the heating-dominant season in the unoccupied period. The occupancy will only suffer from thermal discomfort while the space is occupied. A statistical distribution of Unmet Degrees (UDs) in Geo-OCC and Non-OCC during occupied hours is depicted in Fig. 11 (a) using a boxplot representing UDs every 5 min in each occupied hour. The UD in Geo-OCC was more significant than that in Non-OCC, with a maximum 5-minute UD of 3.83 °C in Geo-OCC and 0.83 °C in Non-OCC. The average UD in a 5-minute interval was 0.14 °C in Geo-OCC mode and 0.08 °C in Non-OCC mode. The general observations of UDs differences between OCC and Non-OCC, and discomfort issues caused by OCC are consistent with similar studies [12,18]. UDs were influenced by two factors: the occupancy schedule and the time of first arrival. Fig. 11 (b) shows the frequency of hours of first arrivals during the testing period, occurring between 8:00 to 12:00 and 14:00. These arrival times corresponded to significantly higher UDs, as displayed in Fig. 11 (a). Additionally, the magnitude of UD was also affected by outdoor air temperature. Notably, despite the occupant arriving at homes only 11.1 % of the recorded duration at 14:00, substantial UDs were observed during that period due to lower outdoor air temperatures compared to other days. The correlation between outdoor air temperature and UD will be further explored in Section 4.2.3. Cumulative UDHs for Geo-OCC and Non-OCC are visualized in Fig. 12 (a), reflecting the cumulative duration and extent of thermal discomfort. As mentioned in Section 2.2.2, the temperature control in Ecobee implemented a \u201cswing temperature\u201d strategy to minimize frequent on and off switching. The swing temperature resulted in indoor air temperature fluctuations around the setpoint, significantly impacting cumulative UDH and distorting comparisons by aggregating inevitable UDH due to the swing temperature. To isolate the UDH caused by the control strategy, adjustments were made to the temperature setpoint, considering the swing temperature. This adjustment involved adjusting the heating setpoint as the actual heating setpoint minus the swing temperature and the cooling setpoint as the actual cooling setpoint plus the swing temperature when calculating the cumulative UDH. As shown in Fig. 12 (a), the cumulative UDH was 3.16 °C-H in Geo-OCC mode and 0 °C-H in Non-OCC mode throughout the testing period of 25 days in scenario 1. 4.2.2 Thermal comfort in scenario 2 The dataset analyzed in scenario 2 encompasses 5-minute temperature records for both Geo-OCC and Sensed-OCC, covering 7 days and totaling 47 occupied hours. Fig. 10 (b) visualizes the heatmap illustrating the average UDs for Geo-OCC and Sensed-OCC during occupied and unoccupied periods in each 5-minute interval throughout the day. Similar to Fig. 10 (a), a redder color denotes a higher UD. In scenario 2, the occupancy status reflected the actual period of occupancy upon the occupant's entry into the home, emphasizing the preconditioning characteristic of Geo-OCC. In Sensed-OCC, the temperature setpoint switches to the normal setpoint during occupancy and the setback during unoccupied periods. For Geo-OCC, the temperature setpoint mirrors that of Sensed-OCC during occupancy. However, during unoccupied periods, the setpoint might either be the normal setpoint or the setback, depending on whether the occupant entered the geofence. As shown in Fig. 10 (b), UDs in Sensed-OCC upon initial arrival were notable, yet these were alleviated in Geo-OCC. The UD partially shifted to the unoccupied period before the occupant entered the home, evident from the red stripe in the first row (i.e., unoccupied period of Geo-OCC) of Fig. 10 (b). This shift occurred because the temperature setpoint was changed to the normal setpoint to precondition the area once the occupant entered the geofence but was still outside the home. Overall, Geo-OCC led to improved thermal comfort for occupants, as the UD during occupied periods is much more important for the built environment than that in unoccupied periods. The boxplot in Fig. 13 showcases the distribution of 5-minuteUDs during each occupied hour for both Geo-OCC and Sensed-OCC in scenario 2. Usually, the occupant arrived at lab homes around 10:00. Consequently, the UD in Sensed-OCC at 10:00 is higher than that in Geo-OCC, primarily because the home is pre-conditioned in Geo-OCC mod. The maximum UD observed in a 5-minute interval was 1.79 °C in Geo-OCC mode and 2.28 °C in Sensed-OCC mode. The average UD in a 5-minute interval was 0.10 °C in Geo-OCC mode and 0.13 °C in Sensed-OCC mode. The UDs observed between Geo-OCC in scenario 1 are not comparable with those in scenario 2 due to differences in outdoor air temperatures. Scenario 2 exhibited more moderate outdoor temperatures compared to scenario 1, resulting in a lower heating load. The cumulative UDH in scenario 2 was calculated the same way as that in scenario 1. The cumulative UDHs for Geo-OCC and Sensed-OCC are compared in Fig. 12 (b). The cumulative UDH in Sensed-OCC was observed higher than that from Geo-OCC, which demonstrated the capability of Geo-OCC to enhance thermal comfort. The cumulative UDH was 0.12 °C-H in Geo-OCC mode and 0.26 °C-H in Sensed-OCC mode throughout the testing period of 7 days in scenario 2. 4.2.3 Impact of outdoor air temperature Outdoor air temperature is an important factor in UD. Fig. 14 illustrates the correlation between 5-minute UD during the occupied period and outdoor temperature in the Non-OCC, Sensed-OCC, and Geo-OCC modes for both scenario 1 and scenario 2. The x-axis represents outdoor air temperature, while the y-axis shows the UD in a 5-minute interval. Different control strategies in various scenarios are indicated by dot colors; for instance, blue dots denote Geo-OCC in scenario 1. Based on the experimental data shown in Fig. 14, in all OCC modes, a higher UD was often associated with colder outdoor air temperatures during the heating season across all OCC modes. Conversely, lower outdoor temperatures might not consistently result in high UDs, as the UD was also influenced by factors such as occupancy schedules and previous home conditions. Compared with Geo-OCC and Sense-OCC in scenario 2 (i.e., green dots and red dots in Fig. 14), it was observed that the UD in Geo-OCC was less pronounced compared to Sensed-OCC under the same outdoor conditions. This observation indicates the capability of Geo-OCC to enhance indoor thermal comfort. In contrast, the UD in Non-OCC mode consistently remained below 1 °C, as the rooms were consistently conditioned in this mode, maintaining the UD within the swing temperature range. In summary, the experiment in scenario 1 showed that thermal comfort issues caused by traditional OCC were observed when compared to Non-OCC. However, in scenario 2, the thermal comfort issues caused by conventional Sensed-OCC were alleviated by Geo-OCC. The degree of thermal discomfort in terms of UD and UDH in each control mode will be summarized, compared, and analyzed in section 4.5, along with the influence on energy consumption. 4.3 Energy consumption of HVAC In this section, a comparison of HVAC system energy consumption between Geo-OCC, Non-OCC, and Sensed-OCC modes is conducted. Each lab home was equipped with an AC unit for cooling and an electrical furnace for heating, alongside a blower within the HVAC system. The energy consumption for the HVAC system was calculated by the sum of the energy consumption of the AC unit, electrical furnace, and blower. The energy-saving ratio is defined in Equation (4), where the west home serves as a baseline case for comparison with the east home. Notably, if the energy consumption in the east home surpasses that of the west home, the resulting energy-saving ratio will display a negative value. E n e r g y - s a v i n g R a t i o = ∑ E E a s t H o m e - ∑ E W e s t H o m e ∑ E W e s t H o m e ∗ 100 % (4). 4.3.1 Energy consumption in scenario 1 Fig. 15 displays the daily HVAC energy consumption for both Geo-OCC and Non-OCC modes over the entire experimental period. Across most days, the daily HVAC energy consumption in Non-OCC surpassed that of Geo-OCC due to the setback applied during the unoccupied periods in Geo-OCC. Throughout the 25-day testing period, the cumulative energy consumption for the HVAC system tallied 110.42 kWh in Geo-OCC mode and 206.07 kWh in Non-OCC mode, yielding an energy-saving ratio of 46.41 %. Compared to simulation results from a similar climate zone with similar temperature setpoints [7,14], this field test exhibited a higher energy-saving ratio. This discrepancy can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, the field test took place during a heating season in a location categorized as hot and humid summers and mild winters with moderate heating demands, resulting in a relatively lower base heating load, thereby inflating the energy-saving ratio. Secondly, the occupancy schedule adopted for this field test followed a laid-back office schedule, where occupants arrived late in the morning and departed early in the afternoon. Consequently, there were more unoccupied hours, contributing to greater energy savings for Geo-OCC during unoccupied periods with larger heating loads. A more comprehensive whole-year energy-saving ratio of OCC can be referred from the simulation results reported in [7] and [14]. The relationships between outdoor air temperature, HVAC energy consumption, energy savings, and energy-saving ratios were analyzed. Due to varying occupant patterns under different outdoor conditions, the energy savings and energy-saving ratios were normalized by the unoccupied hours. This involved dividing the energy savings and energy-saving ratios by the unoccupied hours. The impact of outdoor air temperature on energy consumption is illustrated in Fig. 16 , wherein the y-axis represents the daily HVAC system energy consumption in the first subplot, the normalized daily energy-saving ratio in the second subplot, and the normalized absolute energy savings in the third subplot. Generally, as the average outdoor air dry-bulb temperature decreases, the daily energy consumption tends to increase for both Geo-OCC and Non-OCC modes. The energy-saving ratio may reach remarkably high levels, even up to 800 %, especially when the baseline energy consumption nears 0. However, such instances can distort the scatter plot in the second subplot of Fig. 16. Therefore, to ensure clarity in the data visualization, data points featuring an energy-saving ratio exceeding 100 % while having an energy consumption lower than 5 kWh have been excluded from the plot. The experimental data indicates an ascending trend, as illustrated by the linear regression with an R2 of 0.55 in the middle subplot of Fig. 16, in the energy-saving ratio within the outdoor air temperature range of 14 °C to 22 °C. However, the energy-saving ratio decreased when the outdoor air temperature dropped to 8 °C. Furthermore, daily energy savings tend to increase as the outdoor air temperature decreases. Nonetheless, it seems that the relationship between energy savings and outdoor air temperature is not a straightforward linear correlation. Additional data points with more experiments are required to formulate a more generalized conclusion. 4.3.2 Energy consumption in scenario 2 Fig. 17 (a) illustrates the daily energy consumption of Geo-OCC and Sensed-OCC throughout the experimental period. As the field testing in scenario 2 was conducted in moderate weather conditions, the energy consumption of the HVAC system remained relatively low, totaling 11.66 kWh for Geo-OCC and 14.48 kWh for Sensed-OCC throughout the entire 7-day testing duration. Based on the field-measured data of 7 days, Geo-OCC consumed 2.82 kWh (19.5 %) less energy compared to Sensed-OCC. The maximum difference in daily energy consumption between Geo-OCC and Sensed-OCC was 1.02 kWh. The reduced energy consumption observed in Geo-OCC during this field test can be attributed to several factors. First, the overall heating load was low due to the moderate weather conditions. Additionally, the pre-conditioning time in this experiment ranged from 5 to 30 min, contingent on the occupant's movement speed when configuring the geofence radius to only 5 miles. Consequently, due to the low heating load and the short pre-conditioning period, the heating demand shifted to the moment when occupants entered the geofence but did not enter the home. So, in the Geo-OCC scenario, the HVAC system was activated earlier but shut down sooner, as depicted in Fig. 17 (b). Secondly, during the activation phase of the HVAC system in Sensed-OCC, the peak power might surpass that of Geo-OCC, as evident in Fig. 17 (b). As a result, this might lead to higher power consumption in Sensed-OCC compared to Geo-OCC in this case. To draw a more generic conclusion on the energy consumption for Geo-OCC compared with Sensed-OCC, further experiments in a typical heating/cooling season are needed. No distinct linear or other relationships between energy consumption and outdoor air temperature were observed in this case study due to the moderate weather conditions and a relatively short testing period. 4.4 Peak load of HVAC system A critical concern of the application of OCC is the occurrence of surging peak loads [12]. Fig. 18 shows an example of the surging peak load issue on February 28th, 2023. The left figure showcases the power trends for Geo-OCC and Non-OCC, while the right diagram displays the indoor and outdoor air temperatures for both strategies. The application of setback in Geo-OCC resulted in a lower indoor air temperature during unoccupied periods, causing a surge in the activated load of the HVAC system. This surge could potentially strain the grid and lead to increased demand charges. Such issues could be more impactful during the summer in cooling-dominant regions. A comparison between the HVAC peak loads of each day in Geo-OCC and Non-OCC is presented in Fig. 19 (a). Under the same outdoor weather conditions, the peak load in Geo-OCC tended to exceed that in Non-OCC. The maximum peak power recorded for the HVAC system was 8.29 kW in Geo-OCC and 3.35 kW in Non-OCC. Throughout the testing period, the sum of peak loads of each day in Geo-OCC was 1.69 times higher than that in Non-OCC. Fig. 19 (b) illustrates the HVAC peak load of each day in Geo-OCC and Sensed-OCC during scenario 2. The maximum peak power recorded for the HVAC system was 3.36 kW in Geo-OCC and 3.94 kW in Sensed-OCC. The sum of the peak load of each day in Geo-OCC is 0.95 times that in Sensed-OCC, indicating Geo-OCC's potential to help mitigate surging peak demands within OCC applications in this case study. 4.5 Summary This section presented an analysis of thermal comfort, HVAC system energy consumption, and peak load in the apples-to-apples field comparisons. Key performance indicators are summarized in Table 3 . Scenario 1 involved a comparison between Geo-OCC and Non-OCC. In scenario 1, the home was considered occupied once the occupant entered the geofence boundary to compare the typical OCC and the Non-OCC. UDs in Geo-OCC were notably higher than those in Non-OCC when the house was first re-occupied. The maximum 5-minute UD in the occupied period was 3.83 °C in Geo-OCC mode and 0.83 °C in Non-OCC mode. The average 5-minute UD in the occupied period was 0.14 °C in Geo-OCC mode and 0.08 °C in Non-OCC mode. The cumulative UDH, considering a 1.11 °C swing temperature, was 3.16 °C-H for Geo-OCC and 0 °C-H for Non-OCC over 25 testing days. The total HVAC system energy consumption during the testing period was 110.43 kWh for Geo-OCC and 206.07 kWh for Non-OCC. The maximum peak power of the HVAC system was 8.29 kW in Geo-OCC and 3.35 kW in Non-OCC. Geo-OCC demonstrated a 46.41 % reduction in energy consumption and a 59.59 % increase in maximum peak demand compared to Non-OCC while slightly compromising thermal comfort. Geo-OCC is believed to have the capacity to alleviate the thermal comfort issues caused by OCC [14,29,31]. Scenario 2 compared Geo-OCC with traditional Sensed-OCC. In scenario 2, the home was deemed occupied only after the occupant entered the home. The maximum 5-minute UD in the occupied period was 1.94 °C in Geo-OCC mode and 2.28 °C in Sensed-OCC mode. The average 5-minute UD in the occupied period was 0.10 °C in Geo-OCC mode and 0.13 °C in Sensed-OCC mode. The cumulative UDH, considering a 1.11 °C (2 °F) swing temperature, was 0.12 °C-H for Geo-OCC and 0.26 °C-H for Sensed-OCC over 7 testing days. The 5-minute UDs in Geo-OCC were notably lower than those in Sensed-OCC during the occupied period, especially at the occupant's first arrival, demonstrating the capability of Geo-OCC to alleviate thermal discomfort. The total HVAC system energy consumption during the testing period was 11.66 kWh for Geo-OCC and 14.48 kWh for Sensed-OCC in this field testing. The maximum peak power of the HVAC system was 3.36 kW in Geo-OCC and 3.94 kW in Sensed-OCC. Geo-OCC consumed slightly less energy (i.e., 2.82 kWh) than Sensed-OCC due to the moderate outdoor weather conditions and the small geofence radius, as explained in Section 4.3.2. 5 Conclusions, limitations, and future work 5.1 Conclusions This study conducted two sets of apples-to-apples field tests at the Texas A&M Smart and Connected Homes Testbed (TAM-SCHT) in Bryan, TX, USA. The geolocation-based occupancy-centric control (Geo-OCC) was first compared with conventional control without OCC (Non-OCC) to demonstrate the effects of implementing OCC over 25 days in February and March 2023. Then the Geo-OCC was compared with a typical occupancy-presence OCC (Sensed-OCC) to demonstrate the advantages of integrating geolocation and geofencing over seven days in March and April 2023. The Geo-OCC has the location data transmitted to a remote Raspberry Pi acting as a controller via the Google Maps Geolocation API, and a temperature setback of 3.33 °C (6 °F) was implemented using the Ecobee python API to convey the control variable (i.e., temperature setpoint) to the Ecobee smart thermostat if the occupant is outside of the geofence boundary. The thermal comfort, energy composition and peak load of the HVAC system obtained from the field testing were comprehensively analyzed to compare different control strategies. The 5-minute unmet degree (UD) and cumulative unmet degree hour (UDH) were adapted to quantify thermal comfort. Energy-saving ratios were used to evaluate the energy efficiency of different OCC methods. The impact of different control strategies on peak load was also analyzed. The conclusions from this case study are drawn as follows: \u2022 Compared with conventional control without OCC, the OCC achieved energy savings while slightly affecting thermal comfort during occupied periods, especially upon the first arrival of occupants. The second field testing exhibited the capability of Geo-OCC to enhance thermal comfort with minor effects on the energy consumption of the HVAC system. \u2022 The analysis of UD and UDH suggests that OCC might adversely affect thermal comfort and the Geo-OCC could mitigate the adverse impact of OCC, especially in the moment the home was re-occupied. In scenario 1, the 5-minute UD in Geo-OCC, recorded at 3.83 °C, was observed to be higher than that in Non-OCC, which measured 0.83 °C. During scenario 2, the 5-minute UD in Geo-OCC was observed to be 1.94 °C, which was lower than that in Sensed-OCC, measuring 2.28 °C. \u2022 The apples-to-apples comparison between Geo-OCC and Non-OCC showcased a significant energy-saving ratio achieved by OCC with HVAC systems in Geo-OCC mode consuming 46.41 % less HVAC energy compared to Non-OCC in this field testing. The reported value might appear bigger compared to the energy-saving ratio found in other studies due to the low energy consumption of the baseline and the laid-back occupancy schedule. \u2022 The side-by-side comparison between Geo-OCC and Sensed-OCC indicated that Geo-OCC had a slight impact on energy consumption for our case study, with Geo-OCC consuming 19.5 % less energy (i.e., 2.82 kWh) than Sense-OCC in this case study. This can be explained by the moderate outdoor weather conditions and the small radius of geofence. It is noted that energy-saving ratios are influenced by the thermal mass of the building envelope, outdoor weather conditions, occupancy schedule, the degree of setback, radius of geofence. Therefore, the energy performance should be measured or investigated case by case. \u2022 OCCs introduced a surge in peak load, particularly during the occupant's initial arrival. Geo-OCC displayed the potential to reduce the peak demand increase caused by Sensed-OCC. During the testing period of scenario 1, the HVAC system's maximum peak power was 8.29 kW in Geo-OCC and 3.35 kW in Non-OCC, resulting in a 59.59 % increase in maximum peak power. In scenario 2, the maximum peak power was 3.36 kW in Geo-OCC and 3.94 kW in Sensed-OCC, with Geo-OCC achieving a 14.7 % decrease in maximum peak power compared to Sensed-OCC. \u2022 UD and energy savings were significantly influenced by outdoor air temperatures, with energy consumption and energy savings ratio of OCC increasing proportionally as outdoor air temperatures decreased between 14 °C to 22 °C in this field testing. However, UD and energy consumption were also influenced by other factors such as occupancy schedules. Overall, this study facilitates understanding the effectiveness of Geo-OCC and OCCs in reducing building energy consumption while maintaining indoor air temperatures for thermal comfort. The findings can inform the design and implementation of the smart home management system, integrating geolocation and OCC to optimize energy consumption and enhance occupant comfort. 5.2 Limitations and future work Limitations and future work are summarized as follows: \u2022 Firstly, field testing with a longer test period, spanning both heating and cooling seasons with different occupancy schedules, is suggested to get a more generalized result. In particular, it is imperative to have the testing with extreme weather conditions (e.g., heat waves, winter storms, etc.) to demonstrate the benefits of Geo-OCC. \u2022 Secondly, the impact of the potential inaccuracy of the geolocational method used in this study needs to be considered and studied. The method used in this study relies on a stable internet connection to ping Wi-Fi access points and cellular towers for precise longitudinal and latitudinal coordinates. Consequently, there might be a slight margin of error in pinpointing an occupant's exact location, typically within a half-mile range. Other geolocation tools, such as Selenium [51] which can scrape html data for a device\u2019s location when partnered with an Android phone, or Amazon Sidewalk [52] which can track a device\u2019s location in real-time, could be explored to obtain a cheaper and possible more accurate location of the occupant. Additionally, the impacts of the accuracy of the occupancy presence sensor should be incorporated into comparative case studies as well. Furthermore, it is worth investigating smarter methods to adaptively determine the radius of geofences by leveraging technologies such as machine learning. \u2022 Thirdly, another significant concern is cybersecurity and privacy regarding external occupant tracking (i.e., geolocation). Some research has proposed methods and frameworks for preserving privacy in occupancy detection and continuous location traces [53\u201355]. Preventative measures must be introduced to ensure that their geolocation information cannot be accessed by hackers or others who might want to use the data for malicious purposes when implementing geofencing. \u2022 Lastly, researchers should investigate large-scale field testing with real occupied homes and explore more dynamic occupancy schedules. This approach would provide better and more convincing estimates of energy savings, especially with a sufficient number of homes recruited. Besides, being conducted in a controlled laboratory environment of homes, this study didn\u2019t encompass the complexities encountered in a genuine real-world setting. For instance, it doesn't account for geolocation-based occupancy control of HVAC systems within a city or town environment. This could potentially lead the control system to detect an \u201coccupied\u201d status when the occupant is near home for grocery shopping or other external activities. Further study on the real-world application of Geo-OCC in different climate zones should provide a more comprehensive understanding of the implementation of Geo-OCC.

        "dc:description": "Several studies have highlighted the thermal comfort challenges associated with occupancy-centric control (OCC) when occupants first arrive, despite OCC demonstrating energy savings potential in buildings. To address this challenge, a geofence-based OCC (Geo-OCC), where the virtual boundary of the occupant\u2019s physical location is infused into the smart thermostat, is explored to pre-condition buildings, aiming to alleviate thermal discomfort. This research adopted an apples-to-apples field testing approach to quantify how Geo-OCC impacts the thermal comfort and energy consumption of the heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) system in two 1,200 ft2 lab homes located in Texas, USA. These two homes were designed and built as identically as they could be. Two side-by-side experimental scenarios were designed to compare different control strategies through integrations with smart thermostats. In scenario 1, Geo-OCC was implemented in the east home, while a baseline case without OCC (Non-OCC) was executed in the west home. In scenario 2, Geo-OCC was employed in the east home, and a traditional OCC based on occupancy presence sensors (Sensed-OCC) was implemented in the west home, demonstrating Geo-OCC\u2019s ability to alleviate thermal discomfort. The field-testing results of scenario 1 suggested that Geo-OCC achieved a 46.41 % reduction in heating energy consumption compared to Non-OCC over the testing duration of 25 days, resulting in a maximum unmet degree (UD) of 3.83 °C in a 5-minute sampling frequency, in contrast to a maximum UD of 0.83 °C in Non-OCC mode. The results from the field testing in scenario 2 indicated that Geo-OCC reduced the maximum UD to 1.94 °C in a 5-minute sampling frequency, compared to 2.28 °C in Sensed-OCC, without an increase in heating energy consumption. The results of the scenario 1 experiment suggested the OCC decreased the HVAC energy consumption while having a slightly adverse effect on thermal comfort during occupied periods, especially upon the first arrival of occupants. The field testing of scenario 2 exhibited the capability of Geo-OCC to enhance thermal comfort with minor effects on the HVAC energy consumption. In addition, Geo-OCC displayed the potential to reduce the peak demand increase caused by traditional Sensed-OCC.",
