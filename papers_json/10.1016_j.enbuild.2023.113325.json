Graphical abstract The indoor thermal environment in buildings, industry, and other fields greatly affects human thermal comfort, productivity, energy consumption, and even health. The heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system is the primary way to regulate the indoor thermal environment. However, the local thermal discomfort phenomenon is widespread nowadays. With the increasing demand for intelligent control of the indoor thermal environment on demand, it is necessary to clarify the thermal comfort demand law of the human body. Note that, existing related studies mainly focus on the thermal comfort model, the thermal sensation model, and the thermophysiological model. And researchers tend to consider physiological parameters in these models rather than directly considering psychological factors. But the objective physiological parameters and psychological factors are precursors of thermal comfort, which directly determine the human thermal comfort level. In addition, the human factors relationship between objective physiological parameters, psychological parameters, behavioral parameters, and environmental parameters has not been fully elucidated. Therefore, it is difficult to achieve truly intelligent regulation. This investigation provides new insights for future research directions on human factors engineering for on-demand intelligent control of HVAC systems, which helps to build a healthy, comfortable, productive, low carbon, and energy-saving indoor environments in closed/semi-closed spaces.

To date, the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems are the primary means of regulating the indoor microclimate environment. According to statistics, the energy consumption of HVAC systems accounts for about half of the total building energy consumption [7,8]. However, such huge energy consumption [9] failed to create a healthy, comfortable [10], productive, and energy-efficient indoor environment [11,12]. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to strive for the conditions of a thermal environment that satisfies all occupants. The traditional regulation mode of HVAC systems is the main reason why the indoor thermal environment cannot meet the dynamic needs of personnel [13]. It can be classified into two categories: the conscious human intervention regulation mode and the lumped parameter control mode. For the conscious human intervention regulation mode, people are difficult to accurately assess their dynamic thermal comfort requirements, often leading to incorrect adjustments of temperature set point [4,14], and energy wastage [15,16]. More importantly, it cannot meet the health and comfort needs of special populations such as the elderly, weak, sick, disabled, pregnant, and others [17] who face physical limitations during operations or sleep periods (27% of people have sleep problems [18]). Lumped parameter control mode uses a thermostat to regulate the spatiotemporal non-uniform thermal indoor environment based on the measured temperature at a fixed point. It fails to consider actual human dynamic thermal comfort and on-demand regulation [19,20], especially when the room is unoccupied. Compared to the uniform and stable environment that the above HVAC systems attempt to create, personalized or on-demand ventilation can save energy while meeting human thermal comfort needs [21]. The research results of Xie et al., [22] demonstrated that the demand-centered indoor thermal comfort regulation can not only improve thermal comfort by 29.1% but also save 22% energy. Therefore, how to obtain the dynamic thermal comfort demand law of people in real-time and carry out intelligent on-demand control of the indoor environments is the way forward. In recent years, researchers [23,24] have attempted to use different new control methods [25,26] to achieve intelligent control of the indoor environment based on the human thermal comfort demand law [17]. For example, Li and Chen [27] developed intelligent HVAC system control that creates a comfortable environment by correlating the average facial skin temperature with thermal sensation voting (TSV). Cosma and Simha [23,24] constructed a human thermal comfort model for HVAC system control according to the significant correlation between the temperature difference between different body parts, local skin temperature, and thermal comfort. Other studies [25,28] tried to use artificial intelligence technology, especially machine learning [29], to determine the human thermal comfort demand law. For example, Wang et al., [25] used machine learning to build a thermal comfort model for intelligent control of the indoor environment based on the physiological parameters measured by infrared thermal imaging. Note that, the above existing on-demand regulation methods [23,24] did not consider the influence of environmental parameters around humans and the spatial position relationship between personnel and air conditioning terminals [25,28], etc. which will also cause energy wastage. In addition, in the heat exchange process between the human body and the environment in a real non-uniform environment, the thermal response of the human body directly depends on the environmental parameters around the human body, rather than the whole non-uniform environment. Therefore, these studies have not fully comprehended the human thermal comfort demand law and the existing models related to the thermal comfort demand law have not been fully utilized. Due to the challenge of determining which model is appropriate or whether it is necessary to develop new on-demand intelligent control models for HVAC systems [3], it is urgent and important to summarize the existing models related to the human thermal comfort demand law. This review first summarized the indoor thermal discomfort problem and its potential influencing factors as shown in Fig. 1 , then reviewed the existing human thermal comforts demand law/thermal comfort evaluation methods, such as thermal sensation, thermal comfort, and thermophysiological models from a new perspective. Finally, this paper discussed the challenges of existing research and provided new insights for future research directions on on-demand intelligent control methods based on human factors engineering. The proposed on-demand intelligent control methods based on human factors engineering is not only applicable to the indoor environment of buildings [30], but also applicable to creating low carbon, energy-saving, healthy, and comfort closed/semi-closed indoor environments including industrial workshops, aircraft, ships, subways [31], etc. It will also promote the development of the field/industry of indoor environment construction to automation and intelligence. 2 Indoor thermal discomfort problem and its possible influencing factors Thermal comfort is an important indicator of indoor environmental quality, which affects people's health, work efficiency, learning performance, energy consumption [2], etc. This section focuses on the issues related to actual indoor thermal comfort and its possible influencing factors. 2.1 Local thermal discomfort caused by uneven spatial environmental parameters The spatially non-uniform distribution of environmental parameters easily leads to uneven temperature distribution for various parts of the human body, which leads to different thermal sensations or thermal comfort [32,33]. Fig. 2 illustrates the temperature distribution of an individual in the human thermal comfort experiment in an air-conditioned office during summer. The green dots denote the data points where local thermal sensation and overall thermal sensation are consistent. The orange dots represent the data point set where the local thermal sensation of the forehead is greater than the overall thermal sensation, indicating that the head is hotter. The blue dots indicate the data point set where the local thermal sensation of the knee is less than the overall thermal sensation, meaning that the knee joint experiences local coldness. For instance, when the overall TSV is −2, there will be warmth in the head (TSV fluctuates between −1 and 0), and a cold sensation will appear in the knee joint (TSV fluctuates between −2.5 and −3). This indicates that there are noticeable variations in thermal sensation among different local parts of the human body. Note that the size of the point represents the size of the data point set. Gerrett et al. [34] have also observed non-uniform skin temperature distribution in humans during different activity levels. All these findings show that the micro-environmental parameters around humans required for thermal comfort in different parts of the body are inconsistent with the existing non-uniform environmental parameters, leading to localized sensations of heat or coldness. Therefore, understanding the factors influencing human thermal comfort and the corresponding demand laws is essential for achieving intelligent regulation of the indoor environment. 2.2 Possible parameters affecting human thermal comfort To improve the percentage of thermal satisfaction of personnel, it is necessary to consider all the typical influencing factors accurately when regulating the indoor environment intelligently. The possible influencing factors [29,35] of human thermal comfort include environmental parameters, physiological parameters, psychological parameters, behavioral characteristics, etc. as shown in Fig. 3 . Since it is difficult to identify and precisely define which parameters are the key factors affecting thermal comfort, this study only discusses some potential parameters [36]. Below are the possible detailed parameters of each category: 2.2.1 Environmental parameters Air temperature (T, ℃), mean radiant temperature (tr, K), relative humidity (RH, %) [35], air velocity (V, m/s), pressure(pa), dew point temperature (℃), radiation (W/m2), sound, light, facilities, color, vegetation, etc. 2.2.2 Physiological parameters Age [37], weight (kg), height (m), gender [38,39], heart rate (HR, Beats per minute, BPM) [40,41], skin temperature [42](K), basic metabolic rate [39,43](Met), body mass index (BMI, kg/m2), blood pressure (mmHg), pulse (Bpm), skin electrical signal (μs), skin temperature change rate (K/s), fat percentage (%), sweat rate (mg/(cm2·min)), thermal conductance (W/(m·K), ethnic background, etc. It is important to note that physiological parameters are reliable indicators when evaluating thermal comfort[44]. 2.2.3 Psychological parameters Emotion [45], which can be divided into positive emotions and negative emotions [46]. Ekman [47] further proposed 6 basic emotions: happiness, fear, anger, disgust, surprise, and sadness. However, Cowen and Keltner's recent study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America [48] revealed that humans actually experience 27 different emotions. 2.2.4 Occupant behavior parameters [49] Human activity, clothing insulation (Clo) [39], metabolic rates of activity (M, Met) [35], arms embracing, shivering, sneezing, wiping sweat, shaking legs, cultural, technological (e.g., using an air conditioner), etc. Partial above environmental parameters, physiological parameters, and behavioral parameters have been applied in the model in the following section, such as air temperature, wind speed, skin temperature, skin temperature change rate, clothing insulation (Clo), metabolic rates of activity, etc. The reasons why other parameters [36], such as psychological parameters, were not directly applied in these models may include: 1) the importance and necessity of these parameters in these models are still uncertain, 2) the difficulty in quantifying parameters, etc. In future research, important influencing factors that are currently unused and difficult to quantify can be indirectly considered. 3 Human thermal comfort demand law/thermal comfort evaluation methods There are various models associated with the human thermal comfort demand law. The existing models have evolved from simple to complex, crude to accurate, subjective to objective, overall to local, local non-sensitive position to local sensitive position, single model to coupled integrated model, etc. As different models are constructed based on different purposes, theories, methods, and parameters, they can be categorized into three groups: thermal comfort model (section 3.1), thermal sensation model (section 3.2), and thermophysiological models (section 3.3). This section will also discuss the practical applications of these models, along with their advantages and disadvantages in various scenarios. 3.1 Thermal comfort models There are many indices related to thermal comfort [50], and the widely used thermal comfort models are the predicted mean vote (PMV) and predicted percentage dissatisfied (PPD). PMV model explains the relationship between occupants\u2019 thermal sensations and six thermal parameters (four environment parameters and two behavior parameters). Four environmental parameters are T, V, RH, and tr. Two behavior parameters are M and Clo, respectively. Eqs (1) ∼ (4) show detailed information on the PMV model: (1) PMV = ( 0.303 e - 0.036 M + 0.028 ) × ( M - W ) - 3.05 × 10 - 3 × 5733 - 6.99 ( M - W ) - p amb - 0.42 × ( M - W ) - 58.15 - 1.7 × 10 - 5 × M × ( 5867 - p amb ) - 0.0014 × M × ( 34 - T ) - 3.96 × 10 - 8 f cl × ( t cl + 273 ) 4 - ( t r + 273 ) 4 - f cl h c ( t cl - T ) (2) t cl = 35.7 - 0.028 ( M - W ) - I cl 3.96 × 10 - 8 × f cl × ( t cl + 273 ) 4 - ( t r + 273 ) 4 + f cl h c ( t cl - T ) (3) h c = 2.38 × ( t cl - T ) 0.25 2.38 × ( t cl - T ) 0.25 > 12.1 V 12.1 V 2.38 × ( t cl - T ) 0.25 < 12.1 V (4) f cl = 1.00 + 1.290 I cl I cl ⩽ 0.078 m 2 · ° C / W 1.05 + 0.645 I cl I cl > 0.078 m 2 · ° C / W where W mechanical work done by the human beings (W); pamb the water vapor pressure near the human beings (kPa); tcl the temperature of the outer clothing (K); fcl the clothing area factor; tr means radiant temperature (K); hc convection heat transfer coefficient (W/(m2 K)); Icl the Clo. Since the PMV model from Fanger [51] was developed by testing subjects under different steady-state indoor environments in the 1970 s, it is suitable for evaluating the thermal comfort of the whole human body in a steady-state uniform air-conditioning environment, but not for the thermal comfort evaluation in an unsteady state [36,52]. Moreover, the physiological response, thermal comfort evaluation, and thermal sensation of the human body in a non-uniform or dynamic environment are different from those in a uniform and stable environment [53,54]. In real-world applications, people often overlook the limitations of using the PMV model in an environment that is not uniform. This can lead to inaccurate conclusions. That is why PMV is often different from the actual mean vote [17]. In addition, the PMV model represents the average characteristics of a general population and doesn't take into account the climate or type of building, the evaluation of thermal comfort for individuals in different countries or climate zones [55\u201357] can vary significantly for the same environment [58,59]. Therefore, the PMV model has many limitations in practical applications. To overcome these limitations, many studies have modified the PMV model to adapt to various environments, and part of the improved models are shown in Table 1 . For example, Yao et al., [60] developed the aPMV model suitable for hot and humid climates. Fanger and Toftum [61] further developed the ePMV model which applies to warm and humid climates of non-air-conditioned buildings with significantly increased indoor air temperature. Kim et al., [62] and Nikolopoulou et al., [63] applied the modified PMV model to outdoor and car, respectively. All in all, these studies broaden the scope of application of the PMV model and have good performance. Although many studies [60,61] have improved the applicability of PMV models, various studies [2,60] believe that these models cannot accurately predict thermal comfort levels under special conditions [67,68], such as educational buildings. Unlike office workers, students' adaptive mechanisms in educational spaces (changes in clothing levels, position, window opening, and closing, etc.) significantly affect their thermal preferences. Based on the research on human thermal comfort in actual educational environments, researchers [2,69] have established thermal comfort models suitable for various types based on different parameters, such as effective temperature [64], indoor operating temperature [65,66] and outdoor temperature [69]. These models developed above can better predict human thermal comfort levels and help create energy efficiency indoor environments in real educational buildings. The PPD index indicates the percentage of people dissatisfied with the thermal environment and PPD is the function of PMV. The recommended value of ISO 7730 [70] for the PMV-PPD index is: PPD < 10% and the PMV value is between − 0.5 ∼ + 0.5. Similarly, there is also much research extending the PPD to various environments, such as PPDuniversal for non-uniform thermal environments [71] as shown in Eqs (5) and (6). (5) PPD universal = PPD uniform + PPD non - uniform (6) PPD uniform = PPD ; PPD non - uniform = 0.437 · PPD local - 4.650 ; Although many studies have tried to improve the PMV and PPD models from different perspectives and expand the application scope of PMV and PPD or developed other models (such as effective temperature, standard\u2019 effective temperature [71,72], thermal comfort (TC) models for climate chamber indoor environment [53,73,74], and TC models for real educational buildings [75\u201378] as shown in Table 2 ) to predict the thermal comfort vote [79,80], the majority of these models used for thermal comfort assessment are based on the method of excluding the influence of physiological and psychological factors, which are the precursors of thermal comfort and directly determine the human thermal comfort level [44]. That is the reason why many people feel cold or hot in a thermally comfortable environment for most occupants, which reduced the applicability of these models [81,82]. 3.2 Thermal sensation model As people's reaction to a non-uniform environment is more complex than a uniform one, researchers tend to use the thermal sensation index to judge the subjective feeling of whether the human body is \u201ccold\u201d or \u201chot\u201d to the surrounding environment. Different methods or information are used to construct thermal sensation models. These models can be broadly classified into four categories: thermal sensation model based on local TSV (section 3.2.1), thermal sensation model based on environmental parameters (section 3.2.2), thermal sensation model based on physiological parameters (section 3.2.3), and thermal sensation model based on physiological parameters and machine learning (section 3.2.4). 3.2.1 Thermal sensation model based on local TSV Since humans are more sensitive to the thermal sensation of the body part directly exposed to the environment [83], researchers tried to evaluate the overall thermal sensation (OTS) of a person based on the local TSV [84]. Table 3 shows part of the OTS evaluation models based on partially local TSV. However, people cannot always assess their local thermal sensations in everyday life. In addition, these models are constructed based on subjective questionnaire results, but human perception of the environment is not always very sensitive. Thus, it is easy to introduce large subjective errors (such as emotional fluctuations) to quantitatively determine the thermal comfort level through subjective evaluation [85]. Therefore, this type of model is not suitable for on-demand intelligent control of indoor environments in real life. 3.2.2 Thermal sensation model based on environmental parameters Compared with the laboratory environment under controllable environmental parameters, the factors affecting human thermal comfort in the actual environment are numerous and complex, especially in the indoor environment of densely populated educational buildings. Based on different environmental parameters, such as effective temperature [64], indoor operating temperature [65,94\u201396] , and indoor air temperature [97], researchers constructed adaptive thermal comfort evaluation models to better predict the level of human thermal comfort in this type of indoor environment and guide the creation of a comfortable indoor environment. The research results also indicate that in real life, human thermal comfort is not only influenced by air temperature, but also by factors such as local culture, geographical location, lifestyle, preferences, and expectations for a better life. The research results shown in Table 4 only represent the research results of a certain period in the local area. As lifestyle and expectations factors change, the models in Table 4 need to be adjusted accordingly. Therefore, the applicability of this type of model is phased and regional. 3.2.3 Thermal sensation model based on physiological parameters As human physiological parameters are more accurate indicators for thermal comfort evaluation and their changes directly affect human thermal comfort [44]. Researchers have increasingly focused on evaluating thermal sensation based on physiological parameters [98]. This approach can be used to evaluate both the OTS of the human body (section 3.2.3.1) and the local thermal sensation (LTS) (section 3.2.3.2). 3.2.3.1 OTS model based on physiological parameters Partial OTS evaluation models based on physiological parameters, such as the dynamic thermal sensation (DTS) model [99\u2013101], a transient outdoor thermal comfort model (Lai's) [102], and the whole percent dissatisfied (WPD) model [103] are shown in Table 5 . These thermal sensation models are all built based on partial physiological parameters, and the correlation between environmental parameters and physiological parameters is unclear. Based on the above models for indoor environment regulation, it is necessary to continuously adjust the parameters of the air conditioning terminal by trial-and-error strategy. This method not only wastes time, but also leads to wasted energy. To enable intelligent on-demand regulation of HVAC systems, it is essential to understand the relationship between human physiological parameters and environmental parameters, which constitute the human thermal comfort demand law. 3.2.3.2 LTS model based on physiological parameters Based on the prevalent problem of local thermal discomfort, researchers developed the LTS model based on physiological parameters to study the factors that contribute to local thermal discomfort. Since skin thermal receptors are the primary receptors that respond to thermal stimulation and are located close to the skin [105], the local skin temperature and its gradient were used to develop the OTS or LTS model. Table 6 shows some LTS evaluation models [106] based on physiological parameters of different local locations, such as a model from the University of California, Berkeley (UCB) model [107,108], a PTS model [103], and Zhou et al., [109] model. Notably, all of these models are based on the physiological parameters of local non-sensitive positions, and there are currently no models focusing on the local sensitive locations. 3.2.4 Thermal sensation model based on physiological parameters and machine learning Other studies attempted to construct data-driven models using machine learning which is often utilized to tackle complex high-order nonlinear problems because of its self-learning ability and quick optimization. Table 7 presents some of the OTS evaluation models based on environmental and physiological parameters, and more related models based on the machine learning method can be found in Martins et al., [110]. Artificial neural networks (ANN), random forest (RF), K nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), decision trees (DT), etc., are all available machine learning methods. Although these models aim to establish a connection between thermal sensation/comfort and environmental and physiological parameters, a functional relationship between microenvironment parameters around the human and physiological parameters has not been established. Although different thermal sensation models have been developed for different scenarios, they have their limitations, advantages, and disadvantages. For instance, thermal sensation models based on physiological parameters only consider partial physiological parameters on non-sensitive positions, which may not be appropriate for evaluating TSV on sensitive positions. Additionally, the relationship between physiological parameters of local sensitive and non-sensitive positions is also not well established, and subjective errors in thermal comfort evaluation are still significant. Furthermore, these models do not provide a clear understanding of the objective law of physiological parameters changing with microenvironmental parameters. But the objective law is necessary for the intelligent control of HVAC systems. \u2022 Difference between thermal comfort and thermal sensation Thermal comfort and thermal sensation are two distinct concepts, especially in non-uniform environments [118,119]. Since Fanger proposed the PMV model [51,120] in the 1970 s, a variety of thermal comfort models and thermal sensation models have been emerging. The thermal sensation is primarily the response of skin thermal receptors to thermal stimuli. However, thermal comfort is the combined result of integrating the signals from various receptors to form an overall sense of thermal stimulation. As a result, more factors influence thermal comfort than thermal sensation alone. Importantly, both thermal sensation and thermal comfort are impacted by physiological and psychological factors [36]. Note that, human thermal sensation may not be necessarily related to the energy balance of the human body but is affected by the thermal response of cutaneous thermoreceptors relative to the thermal environment [121,122]. In addition, the overall thermal comfort voting depends on the OTS and the LTS of different parts of the human body [53,105]. In summary, these two indicators influence each other and are independent of each other. 3.3 Thermophysiological models Another type of model related to the thermal comfort demand law is the thermophysiological model [43,123]. These models are a mathematical representation of the heat transfer process between the human body and the environment, as well as the physiological response of the human body. They are created to help understand how the human body responds to different environments and scenarios. Section 3.3.1 presents some thermophysiological models based on the human thermal balance, while section 3.3.2 outlines some improved thermophysiological models. 3.3.1 Thermophysiological models based on the human thermal balance In 1911, Lefevre [124] first proposed a thermal response model by assuming the human body as a sphere exchanging heat with the environment [125]. Since then, research has developed many different human thermal response models, such as Gagge [126], Fiala [127,128], Tanabe [129], and Berkeley comfort model [130], some of which are listed in Table 8 . The human model segmentation and node model of the thermophysiological model are presented in Fig. 4 . The thermophysiological model has evolved from a simple model where the human body was treated as a single segment to a complex model where the human body is considered as a combination of multiple segments. Each segment in the human body temperature regulation models is usually assumed to be composed of skin and core (two-node) or multi-layers (multi-node). As the human body model is refined, its accuracy also improves. Thermophysiological models are used to simulate the thermoregulation and heat exchanges that occur between the real human body, clothing, and environment. These models consist of two different systems: the active system and the passive system. The passive system involves heat transfer within the human body and between the human body and the surrounding environment through processes such as conduction, convection, radiation, evaporation, and respiration. On the other hand, the active system involves vasoconstriction, vasodilation, shivering, and sweating, which dynamically regulate human body temperature. The heat balance equation of body thermoregulation [50,131,132] used in the thermophysiological models is as follows: (7) S = M - W - E + C + R + B where S represents the difference between heat production and heat loss or heat storage (W/m2), W represents work (W/m2), E represents evaporation (W/m2), C represents convection and conduction (W/m2), R represents radiation (W/m2), and B represents respiration (W/m2). Core temperature and skin temperature are important indicators for body temperature regulation [133], and most researchers pay attention to the changes in core temperature and skin temperature in different environments. The two-node model developed by Gagge et al., [126] used for thermal comfort evaluation [134] is suitable for moderate activity levels and uniform environmental conditions [135]. Jones and Ogawa [136] further improved this model to account for transient responses. However, this model is considered too simple and provides limited information, leading to the development of a more detailed multi-node model [137]. For example, the multi-node model proposed by Stolwijk [138] divided the body into 6 segments for space suit design. Based on Stolwijk's work, researchers developed the Fiala model [127,128], the Tanabe model [129], the UCB model [130], etc. In addition to the multi-node model, there are also multi-element models, such as Wissler's [139] model, Fu\u2019s [140], Smith's [141] model, etc. [142] Although the multi-element model only divides the human body into multiple parts without further node division for each part [52], these models require detailed information about the human body and are therefore more complicated [125]. 3.3.2 Improved thermophysiological models To enhance the precision and applicability of the thermophysiological models, researchers have made further improvements to existing models, some of which are listed in Table 9 . For instance, Gagge et al., [126] developed an individualized thermoregulatory bio-heat model that considers the impact of individual parameters like age, gender, BMI, and basic metabolic rate in the two-node model. To better understand the heat and moisture transfer process and thermal response of the human body through clothing, Yang et al., [133] combined the thermophysiological model with the clothes model and considered the air gap between the human body with the fabric clothes. Yang et al., [152] further used the coupling system to predict the core temperature and skin temperature of the human body wearing protective clothing in the thermal environment. Ming et al., [153] studied the heat and moisture transfer models of the human body under two different path transfer conditions, which are the two heat and moisture transfer paths between the naked skin and the environment and between the skin and the environment wearing clothes. In addition, thermophysiological models [154\u2013156] are also combined with human models [157,158] and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) [159,160] to evaluate the thermal response of the human body in various application scenarios, such as the non-uniform environment [132,161]. The corresponding results indicate that the integrated method can predict human thermophysiological responses, such as skin temperature. However, the numerical simulation method requires a three-dimensional model and iterative numerical calculation, making it time-consuming. In general, all the thermophysiological models aim to construct the functional relationship between environmental and physiological parameters and they can be used to predict the human thermal response to the environment. However, these models are too complex to be practical for the actual control of HVAC systems [19]. In addition, some parameters used in the existing models are difficult to measure in real life [19], such as clothing insulation, rectal temperature, and different metabolic rates. In addition, some models, such as the closed calculation program in the PHS model through time iteration, cannot provide intermediate results during their dynamic working process. 3.4 Relationship between different types of models and new perspectives The advantages and disadvantages of different models have been discussed in detail in the previous sections, Fig. 5 further illustrates the connections between different types of models and the parameters involved in these models. It reveals that all these models rely on partial parameters. The solid and dashed lines indicate whether relevant research already exists or not. The solid line indicates that there is relevant research, while the dashed line is the opposite. Moreover, it is important to note that almost all models do not directly consider psychological factors. The future development trend of the indoor environment is intelligent regulation on demand, and the purpose of intelligent regulation is only to create local microenvironment parameters that meet the requirements in the design area. However, the prerequisite is to clarify the required local microenvironment parameters. Local microenvironment parameters are one of the important factors that affect the thermal sensation and comfort level of the human body, while other factors include psychological parameters, physiological parameters, behavioral parameters, etc. These factors are interrelated and influence each other. Although previous studies have proposed various assessment methods of thermal comfort, thermal sensation, and thermal physiology, the influence laws among thermal sensation or comfort, environmental parameters, physiological parameters, psychological parameters, and behavioral parameters have not been fully clarified and understood. This represents a gap in research that requires further investigation. 4 Discussions 4.1 Limitations This study only covers commonly used models within each category of thermal comfort, sensation, and thermophysiology, rather than describing every single model. It also does not list every influencing factor of thermal comfort, but instead uses the most important ones as examples to discuss the current research status and future trends in the field. While this may result in some achievements being overlooked, it does not impact the discussion of the field's future development direction. Future studies can build upon this foundation to further improve and explore the subject. 4.2 Environmental parameters not considered At present, the related models about the human thermal comfort demand law consider the influence of air parameters, light [171,172], colors [173,174], noise [175], etc., and do not consider the influence of other typical parameters such as facilities, and vegetation, etc. The existing studies prove that non-thermal parameters such as noise, lighting, color, and so on do have an impact on human thermal comfort. Therefore, it is one of the main directions in the future to study the correlation law and mechanism between different non-thermal parameters, physiological parameters, and thermal comfort. 4.3 Selection of the parameters for models Many researchers tried to build the thermal sensation/comfort model to evaluate/predict human thermal comfort based on part of the parameters mentioned in section 2.2, and different models adopt different parameters for a particular situation. It is worth noting that there is no strict definition of which parameters are necessary and which parameters are unnecessary up to now. Therefore, the parameter selection further needs exploration. 4.4 Thermal sensation/comfort model Since current methods of collecting thermal comfort and thermal sensation data rely on questionnaires, it is a challenge to ensure continuous human feedback required for model development [176,177]. That is why many other researchers tried to use objective physiological parameters instead of thermal sensation votes to evaluate the OTS and LTS. But the OTS and LTS evaluation models based on physiological parameters only focus on the thermal sensation in non-sensitive locations. So, it is a future trend to evaluate the thermal sensation in both sensitive and non-sensitive locations simultaneously based on objective physiological parameters. 4.5 Thermophysiological model Theoretically, the thermal physiological response prediction results (core temperature and skin temperature) of the available thermophysiological models can be used as input parameters for the thermal comfort model and the thermal sensation model for thermal comfort and thermal sensation evaluation as shown in Fig. 5. However, since the thermophysiological model has not been verified by independent experimental data [178], its prediction accuracy and uncertainty are questioned. Therefore, the application of the thermophysiological model in thermal comfort and thermal sensation evaluation has not been recognized by international standards [52]. 4.6 Personalized thermal comfort model [179] The current thermal sensation/comfort models represent the average response of a large number of people using statistical results, but the physiological difference between individuals is one of the main reasons that affect human thermal response to the environment. In addition, everyone's body changes dynamically with time and age, each person's actual dynamic thermal sensation and thermal response are also different. Although many studies have tried to build personal thermal comfort models, such as Kim et al., [180,181] and Daum et al., [182], the research in this field is still immature. 4.7 Human factor law model (new perspectives of thermal comfort demand law) The thermal sensation/thermal comfort of humans can be affected by the environmental, physiological, psychological, and behavioral parameters, etc., and different parameters influence each other as shown in Fig. 6 . However, the current thermal sensation/comfort models only use parts of the parameters to construct the model and it is difficult to judge whether these parameters are sufficient at present, which will further affect the prediction accuracy of the model. For example, the PMV/PPD indicators did not consider the psychological parameters and the thermophysiological model did not consider the subjective evaluation of thermal comfort. So, the models related to human thermal comfort demand law in the future should be a human factor law model that simultaneously considers all the key influencing factors. Such research will provide new methods for constructing energy-efficient, low-carbon, healthy, and comfortable indoor environments in closed/semi-closed spaces [183]. Therefore, how to explore the law of human factors (human factors engineering) is one of the main research directions in the future. 4.8 Intelligent regulation At present, human physiological behavior parameters have not been considered in the HVAC systems, and personalized regulation based on individual physiological behavior is the future trend. To realize the on-demand intelligent control of the HVAC system, it needs to construct a thermal comfort model for everyone and share the data with the control system in real-time. When all the individual thermal comfort models feedback on the microenvironment parameters demand around the human to the HVAC system, the inverse design method can be used to inversely identify the terminal parameters which can create the required indoor environment. Therefore, future indoor environment regulation should be from a one-size-fits-all approach [51] to a new paradigm with occupant-centric merits [22,184]. 4.9 Numerical prediction of thermal comfort With the continuous improvement of human numerical modeling (involving the heartbeat, blood circulation system, muscle, fat, etc.), numerical algorithm, computer performance, etc., it will be possible to fully use CFD to predict or evaluate human thermal comfort, thermal response, and other indicators in the future. Among all the thermal comfort demand law models, only about 10% or even less were constructed using subjective local thermal comfort evaluations as shown in section 3.2.1. With the development of human factors engineering, models based on objective parameters such as physiology, environment, and behavior will gradually replace the above-mentioned models constructed through subjective questionnaires. The potential sources of error in these models mainly stem from human subjective evaluations and measurement inaccuracies of instruments and equipment. Future research can address or reduce these potential errors by developing human factor models based on objective physiological parameters, enhancing the accuracy of instruments and equipment, conducting repetitive experiments, and other approaches. 5 Conclusion This review summarized the influencing parameters and models related to human thermal comfort demand law. By analyzing the progress, shortcomings, and challenges of existing research, new insights are provided for future research directions. The following conclusions were reached: \u2022 The influencing parameters include environmental, physiological, psychological, and behavioral factors. Existing models can be classified into three categories: thermal comfort, thermal sensation, and thermophysiological models. \u2022 At present, the widely used thermal comfort models are still the PMV and PPD. Although the related models consider environmental parameters, physiological parameters, and behavioral parameters at the same time, these models do not perform well in predicting human thermal comfort in local locations, unstable environments, extreme environments, etc. \u2022 The thermal sensation model based on local TSV (10% or even less of all the thermal comfort demand law models) can evaluate and predict the overall thermal comfort, but it is difficult to dynamically obtain the local thermal sensation evaluation of the human body in real life. \u2022 The thermal sensation model based on physiological parameters can not only predict human thermal sensation by explicit expression but also realize intelligent prediction by machine learning (implicit). However, the OTS and LTS evaluation models based on partial physiological parameters only focus on the thermal sensation in non-sensitive locations. Moreover, it does not directly clarify the corresponding laws of objective physiological parameters changing with microenvironment parameters around the human which is necessary for the on-demand intelligent control of the HVAC system. \u2022 Thermophysiological models are effective in predicting physiological parameters, but there are some limitations. For instance, some parameters used in these models can be challenging to obtain in real-life situations. It is also important to verify the accuracy and uncertainty of predictions made using these models. Additionally, these models may be too complex to use for actual HVAC system control. \u2022 Current studies tend to consider physiological parameters in these models rather than directly considering psychological factors. But both the objective physiological parameters and psychological factors are precursors of thermal comfort, which directly determine the human thermal comfort level. Therefore, it is necessary to consider objective physiological and psychological factors simultaneously. \u2022 The human factors mechanism between objective physiological parameters, psychological parameters, behavioral parameters, and environmental parameters has not been fully elucidated. So, it is difficult to achieve true intelligent regulation of indoor environments. \u2022 The future thermal sensation/comfort model should be a human factor law model (new perspectives of thermal comfort demand law) that simultaneously considers thermal sensation and thermal comfort evaluation, environmental, physiological, psychological, and behavioral parameters, etc. \u2022 The intelligent on-demand control method based on human factors engineering applies to the construction of healthy, comfortable, productive, low carbon, and energy-saving indoor environments in closed/semi-closed spaces including buildings, industrial workshops, aircraft, ships, subways, etc. CRediT authorship contribution statement Xingwang Zhao: Investigation, Methodology, Visualization, Data curation, Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Writing \u2013 original draft, Writing \u2013 review & editing.

        "dc:description": "The indoor thermal environment in buildings, industry, and other fields greatly affects human thermal comfort, productivity, energy consumption, and even health. The heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system is the primary way to regulate the indoor thermal environment. However, the local thermal discomfort phenomenon is widespread nowadays. With the increasing demand for intelligent control of the indoor thermal environment on demand, it is necessary to clarify the thermal comfort demand law of the human body. Note that, existing related studies mainly focus on the thermal comfort model, the thermal sensation model, and the thermophysiological model. And researchers tend to consider physiological parameters in these models rather than directly considering psychological factors. But the objective physiological parameters and psychological factors are precursors of thermal comfort, which directly determine the human thermal comfort level. In addition, the human factors relationship between objective physiological parameters, psychological parameters, behavioral parameters, and environmental parameters has not been fully elucidated. Therefore, it is difficult to achieve truly intelligent regulation. This investigation provides new insights for future research directions on human factors engineering for on-demand intelligent control of HVAC systems, which helps to build a healthy, comfortable, productive, low carbon, and energy-saving indoor environments in closed/semi-closed spaces.",
