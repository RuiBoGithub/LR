HKUST Shenzhen-Hong Kong Collaborative Innovation Research Institute Futian Shenzhen China Building as a Battery (BaB) is a concept aimed at utilizing building energy systems for load shifting purposes. However, there is a lack of study to accurately quantify building load flexibility and analyze how it is impacted by various factors. This study addresses this gap by first quantifying building load flexibility using battery parameters, specifically charging power, energy storage capacity, and round-trip efficiency. Subsequently, an analysis is conducted to examine the impacts of internal and external factors on building load flexibility, Specifically, we studied how ToU utility structure, load shifting duration, comfort range, ambient weather conditions, and building thermal properties influence charging power, energy storage capacity, and round-trip efficiency. Our simulation results revealed that an increase in the peak-to-valley ratio, load shifting duration, building thermal capacity, and cooling demand leads to higher charging energy and energy storage capacity, while an increase in building thermal resistance and widening of the comfort range result in their decrease. Regarding the round-trip efficiency, we found most parameters, except for building thermal capability, have a positive relation with the round-trip efficiency. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis showed that ToU utility structure and ambient weather conditions have the largest impacts on charging power, energy storage capacity, and round-trip efficiency. Additionally, our study indicates that leveraging buildings as virtual batteries for peak demand reduction is a feasible and cost-effective method compared with other energy storage techniques such as electric batteries. Overall, our findings offer valuable insights for parameterizing building load flexibility using battery parameters, analyzing factors that impact building load flexibility and informing grid operator to design property utility structures to meet their load shifting goals.

In addition, the electricity consumption of buildings continues to rise as a result of population growth, improving living standards, and climate change [3]. Achieving carbon neutrality requires an increase in power generation from various renewable energy resources (RES), such as solar photovoltaics (PV) and wind [4]. However, the fluctuation and less controllability of renewables introduces new challenges to the grid operator in terms of managing the balance between demand and supply. Consequently, as the penetration of renewable energy sources continues to rise, there is a simultaneous surge in the demand for load flexibility on the demand side [5,6]. Buildings, being substantial consumers of electricity, possess a considerable capacity to offer cost-effective load flexibility [7]. The idea of utilizing buildings for load shifting is referred to as \u201cbuilding as battery (BaB)\u201d. Building energy consumption majorly has three parts: heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC), lighting, and Miscellaneous Electric Loads (MELs) [8]. In this study, we focus on the building load flexibility from HVAC electricity usage for the following two reasons. First, HVAC is a major electricity end-user within the building [9], which therefore has large potential for load shifting. Second, the building thermal mass provides a unique opportunity to shift building load without sacrificing occupant comfort [10]. The buildings\u2019 HVAC load shifting potential depends on many factors, ranging from building thermal properties (including thermal mass and insulation), ambient weather conditions, Time-of-Use (ToU) utility structure, load shifting duration, etc. Zhou et al. [11] investigated the potential for load shifting using passive thermal storage in a three-story office building situated in Boulder, Colorado. The cost of cooling electricity can be reduced by 21.9 % for lightweight construction and by 26.6 % for heavyweight construction when the on-peak price is four times the off-peak price. When the on-peak price is twice the off-peak price, the savings in cooling costs would be 9.7 % and 13.2 % for lightweight and heavyweight constructions, respectively. Thus, exploiting building load flexibility potential can create a win\u2013win solution for both the property owner and the grid: reducing the utility bills for the property owner, and helping the grid absorb more renewable generations. 1.1 Related work The building load flexibility from employing buildings for load shifting can be characterized by similar metrics as those used for electrical batteries, such as charging power and energy storage capacity. Additionally, utilizing buildings for load shifting typically incurs additional energy consumption. For instance, implementing a precooling strategy to shift the building load results in a higher temperature differential between the indoor and outdoor environments during the precooling periods. Consequently, this leads to more heat dissipation and an increased cooling load [12]. Likewise, in the context of utilizing batteries for energy storage, the discharged energy is typically lower than the energy input during the charging process, as quantified by the round-trip efficiency (RTE). Therefore, many studies borrow these parameters from batteries to quantify building load flexibility, with a particular focus on RTE. Huang et al. [13] conducted an experimental study to investigate the energy loss associated with responding to demand response (DR) signals. The study was performed in a medium-sized, occupied office building heated by rooftop heat pumps. Experimental findings revealed that the round-trip efficiency can range from 0.16 to 0.92, indicating a significant energy loss during the preheating process. Panão et al. [14] presented the measured and simulated performance of BaB systems utilized for thermal energy storage in the living rooms of three different apartment buildings. The findings demonstrate that thermal insulation is the primary factor influencing the thermal efficiency of BaB systems in high thermal mass apartments, with the highly insulated units achieving BaB efficiencies of 60 % to 80 %. Raman and Barooah [15] thoroughly analyzed the RTE of a virtual battery using a simplified physics-based model. The simulation findings show that when the HVAC system is employed as a virtual battery repeatedly, the asymptotic RTE is 1. Additionally, due to the limited number of DR events, the RTE in their case study ranges from 0.7 to 1.3; it may be greater or less than one depending on the duration of the reference DR event. Beil et al. [16] conducted DR experiments on an office building spanning approximately 30,000 m2, employing a 15-minute time frame. In these experiments, they adjusted all of the building's cooling setpoints to alter the power consumption of the fans in the variable air volume (VAV) systems. This was done to track a square-wave power reference signal aimed at achieving energy neutrality. When analyzing the power consumption of the fans independently, they found a RTE of approximately 0.46. Additionally, when analyzing the combined power consumption of the chiller and fans, they found an efficiency of 0.42. Lin et al. [17] investigated the impact of utilizing a building HVAC system to provide auxiliary services on the energy consumption of the facility. To assess the building efficiency during a DR event, they adjusted the fan power consumption and computed the variance between the baseline and actual energy consumption. Their experiments were centered upon the illustrated square-wave DR service. For events initiating with a charging event, they documented RTE values ranging from 0.81 to 0.94. Conversely, for events beginning with a discharging event, the RTE ranged from 1.05 to 1.19. Vrettos et al. [18,19] implemented frequency regulation on a test facility comprising two similar zones serviced by separate VAV systems. Their analysis revealed that implementing frequency control enhances the building's energy efficiency by 8.6 % when comparing the total energy consumption of the two VAV systems. Keskar et al. [20] replicated the experiments conducted by Beil et al. [16] and conducted over 100 square-wave DR experiments on three large commercial buildings. Additionally, the additional energy consumption (AEC) was reported in their paper to further support the assessment of energy inefficiency. The results indicate that approximately half of the total AEC for each experiment occurred during the event period, implying that the control response was significantly asymmetric and inaccurate. MacDonald et al. [21] proposed a new metric, uninstructed energy consumption, to determine the portion of the measured output that was not requested by the system operator. Their experimental findings demonstrate that the AEC values for symmetric services are approximately 2 to 5 times lower than those for asymmetric services with the same capacity. This indicates a significant bias in the results due to the asymmetry of the signal, which is unrelated to the inefficiency of service provision. Conversely, the uninstructed energy consumption (UEC) substantially mitigates the discrepancies between symmetric and asymmetric performance. Any remaining differences indicate true biases in unexpected energy in asymmetric service provision. Furthermore, a few of the studies in Table 1 also covered the impact of various factors on buildings\u2019 load shifting capability. Huang et al. [13] identified a significant correlation between the energy efficiency of the studied building using preheating strategy and outdoor temperature, as well as a highly nonlinear relationship between the rate of zone temperature change and weather conditions. Panão et al. [14] explored the effects of various weather conditions, charge cycles, and thermal mass on building flexibility. Additionally, Keskar et al. [20] found that the efficiency of building response depends on the magnitude and polarity of temperature setpoint changes. Despite significant research efforts dedicated to investigating the buildings\u2019 load shifting capability, it has two limitations that are not addressed by existing works. Firstly, few studies have conducted systematic parametric analyses to investigate the impacts of various parameters, specifically comfort range, ambient weather conditions, building thermal properties, ToU utility structure, and load shifting duration. Consequently, the impacts of these parameters on buildings\u2019 load shifting capability, including charging power, energy storage capacity and round-trip efficiency, are not fully understood. Additionally, there is a lack of sensitivity analysis to investigate which factors have a stronger influence on buildings\u2019 load shifting potential. Secondly, current studies have primarily regulated the temperature setpoint or employed rule-based control (RBC) to shift building loads. Model Predictive Control (MPC), as an advanced control strategy widely used in DR events, has shown potential to achieve higher building efficiency [22]. Therefore, it is imperative to evaluate buildings\u2019 load shifting capability using MPC strategies. 1.2 Scope and objectives To address the aforementioned knowledge gaps, this study quantifies the potential for building energy flexibility and how this potential is influenced by multiple factors when MPC controller is implemented. In comparison to existing literature, this study makes significant contributions in the following ways: \u2022 We parameterized building energy flexibility using battery parameters, specifically charging power, energy storage capacity, and round-trip efficiency, to facilitate an easy comparison between different energy storage technologies. \u2022 We conducted a systematic parametric analysis to investigate how building load shifting capability is influenced by internal and external various factors, including comfort range, ambient weather conditions, building thermal properties, ToU utility structure, load shifting duration, etc. \u2022 We performed a techno-economic analysis to evaluate various energy storage techniques for load shifting, including BaB, Li-Ion battery, and PbA battery, by selecting capital costs and energy loss as key performance indicators. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 introduces the methodology details, including the test virtual environment, control implementation, key performance indicators, and parametric analysis. Section 3 presents the numerical experiment results of the parametric analysis. In Section 4, we focus on analyzing the sensitivity of load shifting capability to input parameters and conduct a techno-economic comparison with electric batteries. Additionally, the contributions and limitations of our work are discussed in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 provides the key conclusions of this study. 2 Methodology The overall workflow of this study is shown in Fig. 1 , which mainly includes the three modules: MPC controller, characterizing building load shifting capability and parametric analysis. The details of each module are given in following sections 2.2∼2.4. 2.1 Test virtual environment The test virtual environment consists of a building model developed using the Modelica Building Library [23] and Dymola software [24], as depicted in Fig. 2 . This library, an open-source Modelica library for building energy and control systems, is freely accessible from https://www.modelica.org/libraries/Buildings. We opt for a first-order resistor\u2013capacitor (RC) model to simulate zone thermal dynamics instead of a physics-based model. This choice allows for straightforward manipulation of parameters R and C to examine the effects of thermal properties on buildings\u2019 load shifting capability. Moreover, MPC has demonstrated superior performance using a first-order RC model compared to rule-based control and reinforcement learning [25]. Cooling energy for the zone is supplied by a chiller, with chilled supply and condensed supply temperatures setting at 7 °C and 32 °C, respectively. The nominal power of the chiller is 1.81 kW, suitable for a small-size building. In addition, we utilize a co-simulation framework to implement the MPC controller for regulating the chiller signal. Co-simulation is a technique that enables individual component models described by algebraic or discrete equations to be simulated by different simulation tools running simultaneously and exchanging data during runtime. The proposed co-simulation framework integrates Modelica and Python, with data exchange facilitated using the Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) standard version 2.0 [26]. The building models are exported as Functional Mockup Units (FMUs) and include boundary conditions, as well as external disturbances such as weather and occupancy data. The MPC controller is coded in Python. The calculated zone temperature by the RC model serves as an output from Modelica and an input to Python. Python then sends the optimal parameter back to the FMU to regulate the chiller signal. 2.2 Control strategy for energy flexibility 2.2.1 Baseline control Prior to conducting the parametric analysis, establishing a baseline case for comparison is essential. In this study, a finely-tuned Proportional-Integral (PI) controller serves as the baseline to regulate the part-load ratio of the chiller and maintain the zone temperature at 25 °C. Additionally, it is employed to evaluate and investigate the effects of various parameters on the building's load shifting capability. The PI controller takes the zone temperature and the chiller modulation signal as inputs, with the output computed to drive the zone temperature towards its set point. 2.2.2 Model predictive control Previous research utilized RBC techniques to adjust the load in response to demand events. For example, they would raise the cooling temperature set-point by 1 °C during a DR event. While this method is straightforward to implement, it may not fully harness the maximum load flexibility of buildings. A significant advancement of our study is the utilization of MPC for the purpose of load shifting. MPC is an advanced control technique initially developed for process control in the chemical industry during the late 1980s. MPC techniques have been applied to building energy management systems to achieve objectives such as energy minimization and demand response. They can be implemented with constraints for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. There are three key benefits of employing the MPC approach for building energy control [27,28]: (1) Systematic development of a dynamic building thermal model for predictive control; (2) explicit inclusion of various physical, environmental, and safety constraints in the optimization problem; and (3) real-time management of disturbances such as fluctuations in ambient temperature and solar radiation. MPC, being an optimization-based control technique, has the capability to maximize load shifting potential by taking into account various factors such as building thermal properties, occupants' comfort range, ambient weather conditions, and utility structure. An essential component of the MPC framework is the predictive model, which forms the foundation for the predictive controller. As previously mentioned, we utilize a first-order RC model to represent zone thermal dynamics. Below is the RC-network thermal model considered for the zone: (1) C d T z dt = T a - T z R + Q ac + α in × Q in + α sol × Q sol where T z and T a represent the zone temperture and outdoor temperature, with units of K; C is the thermal capacitance of the zone and the envelope, with units of K/W; R is the resistance to heat exchange between the outdoors and envelops, with units of J/K; Qac is the cooling influx brought by the chiller, with units of W; Qin is the internal heat load due to occupants, with the unit of W; Qsol is the solar irradiation, with units of W/m2; αin and αsol are the coefficients of the internal heat gains and solar radiation, respectively. αin and αsol are both dertermined as 0.01. The parameters R and C will be changed to considered the different thermal properties. Their values are discussed in section 2.4. For the cooling capacity and power consumption models, we employed regression models where both chiller\u2019s power consumption and cooling output were both fitted as linear functions of the chiller modulation signal, which varies between 0 and 1. A modulation signal of 0 indicates that the chiller is off, while a value of 1 represents full operation at maximum cooling capacity. This linear approximation provides a simplified yet effective representation of the chiller's performance across varying operational levels, allowing for more straightforward integration into the overall load-shifting and demand-response analysis. In Fig. 3 , the predicted data from the regression models are compared with the simulated data from the Modelica model. It is evident that the prediction error of coefficient of variation of the root mean square error (CVRMSE) is within ±5 % for all power consumption and cooling output data, which are smaller than the threshold of ±15 % [29] . The root mean square errors (RMSE) for the power consumption and heating capacity models are 426 W and approximately zero, respectively. The values of RMSE indicate high accuracy for the prediction models developed in this section. Once the prediction models have been developed, the optimization problem is formulated and expressed as Eq. (2) utilizing the chiller's regression models and the proposed first-order model. The objective is to minimize the weighted sum of the energy cost and comfort violation from the current time t 0 until and end of the prediction horizon tf . This represents a typical optimization problem for a DR event [30,31,32]. To ensure that the solver always finds feasible solutions, the objective function introduces slack variables to impose a soft comfort constraint. The zone temperature upper and lower bounds range between 24 °C and 26 °C, with associated weighting factors and slack variables.

The defined optimization problem in this study was solved using CPLEX that is part of the CVXPY toolbox. Due to the building's relatively large thermal mass, we chose a one-hour control step, as it is sufficient to capture the structure's dynamics. Additionally, the MPC controller's prediction horizon is set to six hours. 2.3 Characterizing building load shifting capability In contrast to existing works, we employ three commonly used parameters that effectively quantify battery performance to characterize the load shifting capability of the building: charging power ( Δ P c ), energy storage capacity ( P s ), and round-trip efficiency ( η RTE ). Employing these metrics enables us to explore the effects of different parameters and facilitates easier comparisons between BaB and other load-shifting technologies, such as electric battery and thermal storage tank. Charging power ( Δ P c ) is defined as the deviation of the electrical power consumption of the HVAC system from the baseline power consumption. It quantifies the charging power under the energy flexibility MPC controller and the baseline during the investigation period, as depicted in Eq. (3). (3) Δ P c = P HVAC t - P HVAC b t where P HVAC and P HVAC b are the energy power using MPC controller and baseline PI controller at the time t, with units of W. Energy storage capacity ( P s ) represents the average energy stored by load-shifting technologies, as illustrated in Eq. (4). Notably, the formula for energy storage capacity differs between virtual batteries and electric batteries. While charge energy and discharge energy are always equivalent in a cycle for electric batteries, they may not be equivalent in a cycle for virtual batteries. Therefore, for virtual batteries, the average of the charging energy and discharging energy is considered as the energy storage capacity. Additionally, round-trip efficiency ( η RTE ) quantifies building energy efficiency, as calculated by Eq. (5). (4) P s = 1 2 ∫ t c P HVAC t - P HVAC b t d t + ∫ t d P HVAC t - P HVAC b t d t (5) η RTE = - ∫ t d P t d t ∫ t c P t d t = - ∫ t d P HVAC t - P HVAC b t d t ∫ t c P HVAC t - P HVAC b t d t where t c represents the length of time during which the virtual battery is charging, with the unit of h; and t d be the length of time during which the virtual battery is discharging, with the unit of h. 2.4 Parametric analysis A valuable method for gaining insights into load shifting capability involves analyzing how evaluation metrics behave as various parameters are varied. To develop a parametric study, we identified several external and internal parameters that could potentially influence building load flexibility, including ToU utility structure, load shifting duration, comfort range, ambient weather conditions, and building thermal properties, among others. These parameters are chosen to provide a quantitative summary of parameter changes and their influence on metrics [33]. Table 1 outlines the parameters considered for the parametric study and the number of options identified for each. The parameter ranges were determined through an extensive literature review, expert interviews, and several preliminary simulations. For parameters R and C, as well as the comfort ranges, the values were drawn from existing works [34\u201336]. The varying levels of R and C represent different thermal properties corresponding to building ages or different energy efficiency standards. Additionally, the values for the time-of-use (ToU) utility structure and load shifting duration were derived from interviews with grid researchers. The load shifting duration during off-peak pricing varies from 1 to 4 h, as shown in Fig. 4 . The peak-to-valley ratio, representing the difference between peak and off-peak prices, ranges from 1:1.1 to 1:5. Different combinations of parameters are depicted in Fig. 5 . 3 Results To examine the effects of weather conditions on load shifting capability, three typical days with different cooling demands have been selected for this study: high cooling demand day, moderate cooling demand day, and low cooling demand day. Fig. 6 illustrates the outdoor temperature and solar radiation for these representative days. The average outdoor temperatures are 31.3 ℃, 28.2 ℃, and 26.6 ℃ for the high, moderate, and low cooling demand days, respectively. Solar radiation averages 288 W/m2, 259 W/m2, and 244 W/m2 for the high, moderate, and low cooling demand days, respectively. Once the representative days are determined, we investigate the effects of various parameters on metrics described in section 2.3 under these different cooling demand days. 3.1 The effects of ToU utility structures and shifting duration The first two parameters discussed are ToU utility structure and load shifting duration. Enlarging the peak-to-valley ratio incentivizes more load shifting to minimize the utility bills, while increasing load shifting duration have complex impacts on load shifting behaviors. Fig. 7 illustrates the effects of various ToU utility structures and load shifting duration on load shifting capacity under different representative days. It can be observed that when the load shifting duration is fixed, charging power, energy storage capacity, and round-trip efficiency all increase as the peak-to-valley ratio rises under different cooling demand days. This increase is due to the higher financial incentive to shift loads during more pronounced price differences. Additionally, it can be seen that when the peak-to-valley ratio reaches a threshold, further increases do not result in significant changes, leading to stabilization. This is because the system reaches a saturation point where additional price incentives no longer substantially impact the operational dynamics. Similarly, when the peak-to-valley ratio is fixed, charging power decreases while energy storage capacity and round-trip efficiency increase with longer time durations under different cooling demand days. This occurs because longer load shifting durations allow for more energy to be stored over time, even though the instantaneous charging power may be reduced. To clearly investigate the load patterns before, during, and after load shifting signals, we plot the building load given different utility structures in Fig. 8 . It can be seen that a higher peak-to-valley price ratio allows the building system to utilize off-peak hours more effectively for precooling, leading to an increase in charging power. This subsequently enhances the building's energy storage capacity and round-trip efficiency. Therefore, as the peak-to-valley ratio increases, charging power, energy storage capacity, and round-trip efficiency all increase accordingly. Additionally, when the peak-to-valley ratio reaches a certain threshold, the building system no longer increases its use of off-peak hours for precooling. This is primarily due to the constraints imposed on indoor comfort during MPC control. Further precooling may lead to indoor temperatures falling below the comfort threshold, resulting in decreased comfort levels. Concerning the shifting duration, even with the same peak-to-valley ratio, longer shifting duration does not result in the building system precooling for an extended period and storing more energy. Precooling typically occurs just before electricity prices rise. There was still a slight decrease in charging power with longer shifting duration, as observed in Fig. 5. This is primarily because the outdoor temperature decreases during the prediction horizon of MPC. However, as the discharging power gradually increases, this leads to an increase in energy storage capacity and round-trip efficiency. 3.2 The effects of building thermal properties The building's thermal properties are characterized by the parameters R and C, which represent thermal resistance and thermal capacitance, respectively. Here, we vary the values of parameters R and C and examine their effects on load shifting capability, as illustrated in Fig. 9 . As parameter C increases, the building's ability to store thermal energy improves due to a higher thermal mass, allowing more energy to be absorbed during the charging phase. This results in both charging energy and energy storage capacity increasing, while round-trip efficiency demonstrates an overall decreasing trend. On the other hand, as parameter R increases, the thermal resistance of the building improves, limiting heat flow between the indoor and outdoor environments. This reduces the amount of energy that can be stored, but it enhances round-trip efficiency. Fig. 10 illustrates the load difference between MPC control and baseline for different parameters R and C under high cooling demand day. As parameter C represents the thermal capacitance of the building, an increase in C leads to more energy storage during off-peak price hours through precooling, resulting in larger charging energy and increased energy storage capacity. However, the increase in discharging energy is not as significant as the increase in charging energy, leading to an overall decreasing trend in round-trip efficiency. Parameter R represents the thermal resistance of the building. An increase in R implies a decrease in the heat transfer between the indoor and outdoor environments. Consequently, with higher R values, the building system can store more energy during off-peak price hours via precooling, leading to a gradual decrease in charging energy and energy storage capacity, as depicted in Fig. 8. It is also notable that discharging energy increases as parameter R increases. This occurs because a higher R value reduces the heat transfer between indoors and outdoors, allowing the indoor temperature to remain within the comfort range for a longer period without the need for air conditioning cooling cycles. Consequently, discharging energy gradually increases. As charging energy decreases and discharging energy increases, the round-trip efficiency shows an overall increasing trend. 3.3 The effect of comfort range The comfort range also affects buildings\u2019 load shifting capability and represents the cooling energy required for the building. As the comfort range widens gradually, larger temperature difference can be leveraged for HVAC load shifting. Fig. 11 illustrates the effect of various thermal comfort ranges on load shifting capability. As the comfort range widens, the system gains more flexibility in controlling indoor temperatures during precooling and load shifting, allowing for greater adjustments. Initially, this leads to an increase in both charging power and energy storage capacity, as the building can store more thermal energy without violating comfort constraints. However, as the comfort range continues to widen beyond a certain point, the building no longer requires as much energy for precooling, and the charging power and energy storage capacity start to decrease. Despite these changes, round-trip efficiency shows an overall increasing trend. The increase in efficiency reflects the system\u2019s ability to optimize energy use while maintaining acceptable comfort levels. Additionally, it can be noted from Fig. 11 that the rate of increase in round-trip efficiency on low cooling demand days is significantly greater than that on the other two cooling demand days. Fig. 12 illustrates the load difference between MPC control and baseline for different comfort ranges under high cooling demand conditions. From the graph, it can be observed that during off-peak periods, the energy stored by the building system through precooling exhibits a trend of initially increasing and then decreasing. This phenomenon occurs because when the comfort range is set to 24.5/25.5 °C, although more energy is required to maintain indoor temperature, the relatively narrow comfort range poses a risk of the indoor temperature falling below the lower comfort limit of 24.5 °C if more energy is stored through precooling. However, as the comfort range gradually widens, less energy is needed to maintain indoor temperature, resulting in a gradual decrease in the energy stored through precooling. Consequently, there is a trend where the charging power and energy storage capacity initially increase and then decrease. Moreover, as the comfort range widens, there is also an increasing trend in discharging energy, leading to an overall increase in round-trip efficiency. Additionally, due to the smaller charging power and greater rate of decrease on low cooling demand days, the rate of increase in round-trip efficiency on this representative day is significantly greater than that on the other two representative days. 3.4 The effect of ambient weather condition Various ambient weather conditions correspond to different cooling loads in buildings. A day characterized by higher outdoor temperatures and solar radiation signifies a higher cooling load for the building, and vice versa. As observed in Figs. 7, 9, and 11, the charging power, energy storage capacity, and round-trip efficiency are greater on high cooling demand days compared to the other two representative days with lower cooling demands. Moreover, as the building cooling load decreases, the charging power, energy storage capacity, and round-trip efficiency also decrease accordingly. Given the higher cooling load on days with high cooling demands, the building system stores more energy through precooling which leads to elevated charging power, energy storage capacity, and ultimately, higher round-trip efficiency. 4 Discussion 4.1 Sensitivity analysis Our numerical experiments show that certain parameters wield more significant influence during a DR event, affecting load shifting capabilities to a greater extent than others. In this subsection, we conducted a sensitivity analysis to ascertain which factors exert the most substantial impact on building load shifting potential. There are several methods for conducting sensitivity analysis, and we utilize regression-based sensitivity analysis, a method widely employed in assessing building loads and performance. Regression-based sensitivity analysis methods entail decomposing a square integrable mathematical function Y X into: (6) Y X = f 0 + ∑ i = 1 k f i X i + ∑ j > i k f ij X i , X j + f 12 ⋯ k X 1 , X 2 , ⋯ , X k Assuming the independence of individual input factors, the decomposition is unique [37]. To estimate sensitivity indices based on regression analysis, the model response Y X is approximated by a linear multidimensional model F X with a regression coefficient f i for each input parameter X i : (7) F X = f 0 + ∑ i = 1 k f i X i To ensure comparability of the estimated regression coefficients, they are standardized using the variance of the model response V [ Y ( X ) ] and the variance of the corresponding input parameter V ( X i ) : (8) SR C i = f i V X i V Y X # The absolute value of the standardized regression coefficient (SRC) represents a measure of the parameter's importance, with higher SRC values indicating greater influence on the model outcome. The sign of the SRC value indicates whether the model outcome increases or decreases as the value of the input factor changes [38]. Unlike variance-based methods, SRCs only necessitate one set of parameter samples and model outcomes corresponding to N simulation runs for calculation, rendering them an easy-to-interpret quantitative measure of the impact of input parameters on model outcomes with moderate computational costs. Fig. 13 displays the SRC results for each parameter. From the figure, it is evident that the ToU utility structure (EF1) and ambient weather conditions (EF3) exert the most substantial influence on load shifting capability, impacting charging energy, energy storage capacity, and round-trip efficiency. These parameters are followed by four others. As previously discussed, charging energy, energy storage capacity, and round-trip efficiency demonstrate notable variations during changes in peak-to-valley ratio and ambient weather conditions, underscoring the significance of ToU utility structure and ambient weather condition. The t-ratio results are also provided in this figure, reflecting the strength of association between each independent variable and the dependent variable. Higher absolute t values indicate greater significance of the variable coefficient. It is evident that ToU utility structure and ambient weather condition have the most significant impacts on load shifting capability. 4.2 Techno-economic comparison with battery In addition to BaB technology, various other energy storage technologies play crucial roles in alleviating peak demand stress on the electrical grid. Hence, this study conducts a techno-economic analysis to compare BaB with different electric batteries, such as Li-Ion battery and PbA battery. The comparison involves quantitative assessments of capital cost and energy loss. The capital cost of each energy storage technology is a function of both the costs per energy and power unit [39]. Eq. (9) presents the formula for the capital cost, where the first term denotes the energy contribution (cost per energy unit), while the latter represents the power contribution (cost per power unit) [40]. The cost per energy unit and cost per power unit are listed in Table 3. The energy loss coefficient can be calculated using the following Eq. (10), which effectively assesses how much energy is lost during a charging-discharging cycle. According to the formula, energy loss is a function of round-trip efficiency. (9) CC = C e × E s + C p × P p # (10) η loss = 1 - η RTE # where CC refers to the capital costs, with the unit of $; η loss is energy loss for each technology; C e and C p represent cost per energy unit and cost per power unit, respectively, with units of $/kWh; E s represents the storage energy capacity, with the unit of kWh; P p is the power requirement, with the unit of kW. Table 2 presents the technical and economic characteristics for each energy storage technology. The round-trip efficiency for BaB is the average determined from the simulations in Section 3, while other characteristics are gathered from existing works [40,41,42]. Furthermore, we utilize the average energy storage capacity and charging power obtained from Section 3 under different cooling demand representative days to compute the capital cost and energy loss, as shown in Table 3 . The comparison results for different energy storage technologies are illustrated in Fig. 14 . It is evident that electric batteries entail significantly high capital costs, whereas BaB incurs no capital costs since the building is already constructed. Since Li-Ion battery have relatively high round-trip efficiency, their energy loss coefficient is the lowest among three energy storage technology. The round-trip efficiency for BaB varies significantly across different conditions, ranging from 0.4 to 0.8. This variability implies that up to 60 % of energy could be lost during a charging-discharging cycle. Furthermore, while the round-trip efficiency of PbA battery exceeds that of BaB only on low cooling demand days, the energy loss coefficient of PbA batteries is smaller than that of BaB solely on low cooling demand days. Despite BaB incurring higher energy losses than Li-Ion battery, its zero capital cost is notable. Therefore, leveraging a large number of buildings as virtual batteries for grid peak shaving emerges as an economical and relatively efficient approach. 4.3 Contributions This study makes the following contributions to the existing literature: Firstly, we present a novel methodology for quantifying the potential of building load flexibility, comprising two distinct components. The first component involves characterizing the load flexibility of the building by utilizing battery parameters, enabling a straightforward comparison with other energy storage technologies. Furthermore, in contrast to prior studies that employed Rule-Based Control (RBC) for demand response (DR) signal response, our work employs Model Predictive Control (MPC) as an optimization-based approach to determine the maximum potential of building load flexibility. Secondly, we conduct a systematic parametric analysis to provide a quantitative summary of how various factors impact buildings\u2019 load shifting capability. We consider both internal and external factors. Internal factors, or building-related factors, include building thermal properties and comfort range; while external factors include ToU utility structure, load shifting duration, and ambient weather condition. Next, a regression-based sensitivity analysis is employed to determine which parameters strongly influence buildings\u2019 load shifting capability. By utilizing the standardized regression coefficient (SRC) and t ratio, we assessed the impact of input parameters and found that ToU utility structure and ambient weather condition exert the most significant effects on charging power, energy storage capacity, and round-trip efficiency. Thirdly, we perform a techno-economic analysis to compare BaB with various electric batteries, including Li-Ion battery and PbA battery. Unlike electric batteries, BaB requires lower initial costs but incurs higher energy losses due to its relatively low round-trip efficiency. Nonetheless, utilizing buildings as virtual batteries remains an economically-attractive approach for peak demand reduction. 4.4 Limitations and future work While this study quantifies the energy flexibility potentials and implements sensitivity analysis to investigate the most significant parameters affecting load shifting capability, several limitations require future research attention: The first limitation is that the parametric analysis is conducted in a virtual testbed, where the regression models of chiller closely align with the results from Modelica simulations. However, this virtual testbed has not been validated against real-world field tests. In practical applications, various real-world issues\u2014such as noise, measurement biases, and uncertainties in sensing systems\u2014are not present in this virtual environment, which could affect the accuracy of energy flexibility potential estimates. However, conducting experiments in real buildings presents challenges due to the high implementation costs and potential service interruption, which limits the opportunity for real-world validation. Additionally, this study employs the MPC controller to determine buildings\u2019 load shifting capability given different internal and external factors. With the advancement of machine learning, Reinforcement Learning (RL), as a branch of machine learning specialized in dynamic decision making [43,44] has been rapidly developed and applied in building demand response. Investigating parameter analysis with an RL controller is an interesting avenue for future research. Lastly, this study conducts a simple techno-economic comparison with two types of batteries, neglecting other load shifting technologies such as water tanks, latent heat thermal energy storage, and liquid air energy storage. Future research could conduct a comprehensive techno-economic comparison to compare other common energy storage technologies. 5 Conclusions As the adoption of renewable generation increases, demand-side management becomes increasingly crucial for maintaining real-time grid supply\u2013demand balance. Among the significant electricity end-users, the HVAC systems in buildings play a pivotal role in providing load flexibility for efficient demand-side management. This study introduces a novel methodology to quantify the load flexibility of building HVAC systems and systematically analyze the influences of various factors on building load flexibility. Based on the numerical experiment results, we draw the following conclusions: 1) We identified six factors that impact building load flexibility. Internal factors, or building-related factors, encompass the thermal properties of the building and the comfort range. On the other hand, external factors include the time-of-use (ToU) utility structure, the duration of load shifting, and the ambient weather conditions. Among the above factors, an increase in peak-to-valley ratio, load shifting duration, building thermal capacity, and cooling demand leads to higher charging energy and energy storage capacity, while an increase in building thermal resistance and widening of the comfort range result in their decrease. Round-trip efficiency generally increases with other parameters increases except for building thermal capacity. 2) Regression-based sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine the parameters strongly influencing buildings\u2019 load shifting capability. The results indicate that ToU utility structure and ambient weather conditions have the most significant impacts on charging power, energy storage capacity, and round-trip efficiency. 3) The techno-economic analysis reveals that BaB requires lower investments but exhibits higher energy loss compared to electric batteries. The round-trip efficiency of BaB varies significantly across different conditions, ranging from 0.4 to 0.8, implying potential energy losses of up to 60 % during charging-discharging cycles. Nonetheless, utilizing buildings as virtual batteries remains a straightforward and an economically-attractive approach for peak demand reduction. This study offers valuable insights into understanding and estimating the capacity and efficiency of utilizing building HVAC system for load flexibility. Besides, the finding of this study informs grid operator to design proper Time-of-Use utility structure to achieve their load shifting goal.

However, there is a lack of study to accurately quantify building load flexibility and analyze how it is impacted by various factors. This study addresses this gap by first quantifying building load flexibility using battery parameters, specifically charging power, energy storage capacity, and round-trip efficiency. Subsequently, an analysis is conducted to examine the impacts of internal and external factors on building load flexibility, Specifically, we studied how ToU utility structure, load shifting duration, comfort range, ambient weather conditions, and building thermal properties influence charging power, energy storage capacity, and round-trip efficiency. Our simulation results revealed that an increase in the peak-to-valley ratio, load shifting duration, building thermal capacity, and cooling demand leads to higher charging energy and energy storage capacity, while an increase in building thermal resistance and widening of the comfort range result in their decrease. Regarding the round-trip efficiency, we found most parameters, except for building thermal capability, have a positive relation with the round-trip efficiency. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis showed that ToU utility structure and ambient weather conditions have the largest impacts on charging power, energy storage capacity, and round-trip efficiency. Additionally, our study indicates that leveraging buildings as virtual batteries for peak demand reduction is a feasible and cost-effective method compared with other energy storage techniques such as electric batteries. Overall, our findings offer valuable insights for parameterizing building load flexibility using battery parameters, analyzing factors that impact building load flexibility and informing grid operator to design property utility structures to meet their load shifting goals.",
