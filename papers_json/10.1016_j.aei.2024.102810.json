This paper explores the application of autoencoder algorithms in Automated Fault Detection (AFD) for Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems, specifically focusing on Fan Coil Units (FCUs). The study begins by reviewing the current state of Fault Detection and Diagnostics (FDD), emphasizing the limitations and the potential of unsupervised learning techniques like autoencoders and transfer learning to fill these gaps. Using data from a full-scale building case study featuring five Fan Coil Units (FCUs), the research develops and evaluates autoencoder-based AFD models that models effectively compress multivariate inputs into a reduced latent space, enabling accurate and efficient fault detection. The paper makes two novel contributions: (1) It introduces a methodology to distinguish between equipment-level and system-level faults; and (2) It demonstrates the generalizability of the approach across different types of FCUs through cross-testing and transfer learning. The results indicate that autoencoders outperform other dimensionality reduction algorithms and separate predictors in fault detection accuracy and efficiency. The paper concludes by discussing the implications of these findings for future research and practical applications in building management.

HVAC systems alone can account for half of a building's total energy use, making them a primary focus for energy optimization [2]. The actual energy expenditure often surpasses design estimates due to factors like design flaws, operational variances, and system faults [3,4]. In the U.S. only, such undetected faults can lead to an additional 103 to 500 TWh of energy consumption annually [5]. To mitigate these issues, Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD) has been employed as a cost-effective solution for identifying and addressing these faults [6]. Research in FDD has been extensive, dating back to the late 1980 s, and has included international efforts such as the IEA-EBC's work on real-time HVAC system simulation and computer-aided FDD [7\u20139]. Contemporary FDD research has used a variety of methods with supervised learning being used primarily for fault diagnosis, unsupervised learning is being increasingly used for fault detection given the challenge of obtaining fault data [10], and hybrid learning [11]. A number of reviews have summarized the state-of-the art in FDD, notably [12,13,14,11,10]. However, despite the significant advancement in the field, several challenges continue to exist within the HVAC domain, notably the variable operating conditions of HVAC systems based on weather and occupancy [15], the complexities associated with the interconnectedness of a diversity of HVAC systems [16], fault complexity [17] and the challenges of obtaining labeled fault data [18,19]. Responding to these issues, a new approach for unsupervised learning using autoencoders is presented and validated. The objectives of this research are to a) develop a flexible and robust algorithm capable of detecting faults across devices in the absence of a labelled dataset for training; b) test this approach against a series of potential fault types to determine the limitations of this algorithm; and c) compare the performance of specific vs generalized algorithms to determine its potential scalability across buildings. Both data from a real-world case study, along with a supplementary dataset created using expert input to simulate a broad spectrum of fault types, are used for validation. 2 Literature review Automated fault detection is a rapidly expanding field within the buildings domain [11], with data-driven approaches being increasingly preferred for HVAC systems where model-based approaches become overwhelmingly complex at the building scale [10]. Further, because of the paucity of available fault datasets for most systems [19], unsupervised and hybrid learning approaches are gaining in popularity, particularly for fault detection [10]. To contextualize the autoencoder approach presented in this paper, a review of the literature is presented here, first discussing the breadth of fault detection applications (Section 2.1), then summarizing the state-of-the-art for fault detection in HVAC systems (2.2), before describing autoencoder principles (2.3) and comparing its application for FDD with other methods (2.4). Finally, the literature review findings are summarized in 2.4, articulating the research gap and key insights that have guided this study. 2.1 Fault detection and its applications A fault is characterized as an unintentional deviation in at least one feature of a system from its usual standard condition [20]. The primary aim of FDD is to detect, analyze, and possibly correct these faults before they result in further system damage or loss of service. The FDD approach can vary in its modeling techniques, input\u2013output parameters, and overarching objectives. Typically, the FDD process is broken down into four essential steps: detection of the fault, isolation of its source, identification of its nature, and evaluation of its consequences. These steps collectively constitute what is widely known as automated fault detection and diagnosis (AFDD) [20]. Anomaly detection and fault detection are key methodologies in the field of HVAC system monitoring [21]. Anomaly detection, although widely used, is limited in capturing event-based anomalies and transient states. In some cases, transient faults may resolve themselves, bypassing detection by such methods. Fault detection is designed to identify system failures and malfunctioning operations but faces challenges in the development of practical algorithms. Specifically, the choice of detection thresholds often requires a compromise between false positives and false negatives, leading to potential oversight of some faults. Furthermore, fault detection alone is insufficient for pinpointing the origin of a fault in the system [11]. Fault diagnosis is a process aimed at identifying the characteristics of physical faults, such as type, location, severity, and timing. Two primary approaches for fault diagnosis exist: inference methods and classification methods [23]. Inference methods, such as fault trees, rely on decision trees and conditional statements, making them time-consuming and often requiring domain expertise. On the other hand, classification methods are faster and utilize training data that includes both faults and their corresponding symptoms [24]. Despite the efficiency of classification methods, many studies have favored more interpretable methodologies like Bayesian networks over black-box models for diagnosing faults [23\u201325]. Achieving a rapid and reliable fault diagnosis method remains a challenge, especially for complex HVAC systems. One study indicated that fault diagnosis in HVAC cooling systems can achieve more than 90 % accuracy, a rate that is higher compared to heating systems [26]. Nevertheless, there is a notable gap in the successful development of accurate, real-time Fault Detection and Diagnostics (FDD) processes for sensor-based HVAC systems, requiring further research and development [21]. Fig. 1 illustrates the classification of Fault detection and diagnosis methods explained in this section. 2.1.1 Knowledge-based methods Knowledge-based methods use expert knowledge, rules, and models to identify and diagnose system faults. They combine qualitative elements from both model-based and data-driven approaches, such as structural graphs, fault trees, and fuzzy logic or expert systems [29,22]. These methods are particularly useful when comprehensive physical or mathematical modeling is prohibitively expensive or complex. They are best suited for small-scale systems with limited operational states and inputs, outputs, and states [30]. However, these methods face the challenge of requiring extensive domain-specific knowledge to formulate effective rules for system behavior [31,27]. Model-based approaches to fault detection and diagnostics commonly use dynamic processes for signal and parameter estimation [32,21]. The first-principle method and gray-box models are known techniques in this category [33]. The first-principle method models both static and dynamic systems based on their physical characteristics but is constrained by its slow response time and applicability only to steady-state scenarios. By combining both theoretical models and empirical data to identify and diagnose system faults, gray-box models address this limitation and provide faster responses to sudden faults. However, they require precise physical models coupled with regression methods and may introduce uncertainties by oversimplifying complex systems [33]. Additionally, if the system undergoes any modification, existing models become obsolete. 2.1.2 Data-driven methods Data-driven approaches (DD) for fault detection and diagnostics (FDD) are categorized into qualitative and quantitative methods [34]. Qualitative methods include expert systems, fuzzy logic, and pattern recognition, while quantitative methods encompass statistical methods and neural networks [23]. Unlike model-based approaches, DD methods are practical for complex HVAC systems as they rely solely on historical or operational data and do not require intricate physical models. These methods are capable of dimensionality reduction to focus on significant features in the FDD process [35]. According to Ebrahimifakhar et al., data-mining (DM) methods like Support Vector Machines (SVM) can outperform statistical techniques such as linear discriminant analysis in detecting faults in cooling systems [36]; though such statements must be understood in the context of their particular experimental set-up. DM methods themselves are subdivided into supervised and unsupervised techniques, and many studies have employed these as well as hybrid methods for FDD in HVAC systems [37]. 2.1.3 Combining different FDD methods Combining different FDD methods, such as supervised data-driven and model-based approaches, can improve accuracy in identifying system faults [38\u201341]. This hybrid approach can lead to innovative model structures, such as Bayesian networks with separate layers for faults and symptoms [41]. Although combining methods reduces the number of required attributes for modeling, it introduces challenges. Physical modeling, when combined with DD or knowledge-based methods, risks oversimplification and consequent modeling errors or high false positive rates in large-scale HVAC systems [11]. Additionally, these combined methods demand substantial data storage and computational resources. Knowledge-based methods also reveal limitations when coupled with DD or model-based approaches, especially in providing insights that exceed general engineering knowledge [29]. 2.2 Fault detection in buildings and HVAC The field of FDD in building systems has been thoroughly reviewed, serving as foundational pillars for ongoing studies. Seminal works by Katipamula et al. in 2005 [12] set the groundwork that continues to influence the field. Recent reviews have specialized in various aspects of FDD. For example, Kim et al. focused on FDD methods based on their use of gray or black box modeling approaches [42]. Ahmad et al. conducted a review of computational techniques in FDD for HVAC systems, categorizing them into five key modeling approaches [43]. On a system-specific level, Yu et al. explored typical faults in air-handling units and delineated key characteristics for effective FDD algorithms [14]. Melgaard et al. highlighted that FDD in building systems is still in its early stages, marked by inconsistent terminology and limited data transparency [18]. Advanced FDD algorithms increasingly leverage machine learning techniques, both supervised and unsupervised, for their adaptability and potential in real-world applications [28]. However, these algorithms often require system-specific data, making them costly and time-consuming to implement. Supervised learning requires labeled data, while unsupervised learning, although not dependent on labeled data, still requires a dataset for model validation. These datasets are not only expensive to create but also require specialized expertise. Despite the growing interest in data sharing across research and industry, the availability of open datasets remains limited [19]. Within the scope of FDD, two key processes are fault-tolerant control (FTC) and fault impact analysis (FIA). FTC deals with the adaptive responses of control systems to identified faults, often leading to control reconfiguration to optimize operations after a fault occurs [20]. Zhang et al. developed a framework that combines FTC and FDD for active fault-tolerant control systems [44]. Conversely, FIA, also known as fault evaluation (FE), measures the impact of faults on specific variables, such as energy usage or indoor climate in HVAC systems [18]. Li et al. evaluated different fault modeling tools for HVAC systems, including HVACSIM+, Modelica, and TRNSYS [45]. Using MATLAB/Simulink, Ginestet et al. examined the effects of faults in air-handling units on energy consumption and indoor air quality [46]. Roth et al. and Andersen et al. explored the energy impact of typical faults in commercial buildings and demand-controlled ventilation systems, respectively [5,4]. The FDD process requires a thorough data pre-processing phase, often overlooked in literature [32]. This phase includes data cleaning, integration, transformation, and reduction [47,50]. Proper pre-processing ensures reliable FDD outcomes and minimizes false alarms. Common techniques for dimensionality reduction include Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) [26,53]. Feature selection is also crucial for accurate Data-Driven classification methods in FDD [50,55]. It involves choosing the most relevant attributes, considering correlations among them to prevent model overfitting and to reduce computational complexity. Methods for feature selection are categorized into filter, wrapper, and embedded methods [22]. These can be applied in supervised [52], unsupervised, or semi-supervised settings; [53,58]. Despite progress, Mirnaghi et al. concluded that selecting the optimal feature subset for FDD in HVAC systems remains a contested issue, especially when dealing with large-scale systems and a high number of attributes [11]. 2.2.1 Supervised methods Offline supervised learning uses a training set with pre-defined input and output labels to classify unseen data and is considered a \u201cbackward approach\u201d in Data Mining (DM). Online learning simultaneously conducts training and testing, allowing for continuous label prediction and correction [56,62]. Supervised learning includes classification methods like Decision Trees, Bayesian Networks, and Support Vector Machines (SVM), as well as regression methods including neural networks and K-nearest neighbors (KNN). SVM is especially potent for its ability to find optimal hyperplanes and is effective for non-linear problems [47]. Other methods include non-linear Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Logistic Regression for handling non-linear FDD issues. Han et al. proved that Least Square-SVM (LS-SVM) was more accurate than traditional SVM when the sample size is small [61]. Additionally, Wang et al. and Bailey et al. showed the efficiency of neural network approaches and kernel-based partial least square regressions in detecting faults in various systems like chillers and heat exchangers [62,70]. Overall, the success of these methods is highly dependent on the quality and quantity of labeled data. Bayesian networks in FDD operate on conditional probabilities and work well even without complete system information. However, they are less effective at capturing indirect effects due to the naïve assumption of observation independence. Zhao et al. applied Bayesian networks to Air-handling Units (AHU) systems to address this limitation [60]. Regression methods like logistic and linear regression are used mainly for prediction and are effective in diagnosing faults based on mathematical relationships between attributes [47,27]. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are commonly used in building HVAC systems for FDD. They operate based on residuals and thresholds, where residuals measure the deviation of the system from normal operation. ANN methods are divided into those that generate residuals for fault isolation and those that categorize residuals into fault groups [63]. Shahnazari et al. demonstrated that deep learning techniques such as Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) offer promising results for FDD, especially with limited labeled data [64]. However, these methods have their limitations, such as the potential loss of essential data during automatic feature selection [11]. In general, supervised FDD methods have several key issues. One common challenge is that the training data often originates from older components, negatively affecting the model's accuracy [65]. Second, real-world datasets are highly imbalanced, with the vast majority of data being non-fault conditions. Additionally, there is no structured method for updating the model based on real-time conditions during the early operational period of a component [65]. Lastly, these supervised FDD approaches are generally well-suited for steady-state scenarios but perform poorly in transient conditions [66]. 2.2.2 Unsupervised methods Unsupervised learning methods are employed to uncover indirect correlations and hidden data structures for unlabeled data such as raw data generated by a Building Automation System (BAS). Prominent techniques include clustering, Association Rule Mining (ARM), motif discovery, and self-organized neural networks. ARM is particularly effective for identifying inherent patterns and regularities in data, as demonstrated by Yu et al. [58] in mechanical ventilation systems. Clustering is another useful technique that groups similar objects together, aiding in understanding specific behaviors and relationships within a set. Reddy et al. [59] used clustering for short-term energy consumption predictions in buildings. Xue et al. [67] combined ARM and clustering to detect faults in a district heating system by first categorizing seasonal patterns and then applying ARM to find faults. As described by Zhao et al. in [68], unsupervised learning methods come with limitations, such as generating massive, redundant sets of rules, which necessitate post-mining techniques for meaningful extraction. Also, clustering methods may not properly diagnose new faults if they are not recognized within predefined fault groups [26]. Complexity in relationships among multiple features could also be a challenge for clustering and ARM compared to supervised methods. Self-organized artificial neural networks (ANN) can reduce the number of iterations in training and speed up the FDD process [69]. Recent focus has been on pattern recognition and motif discovery, often used in combination with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as a semi-supervised method [70]. These methods hold promise for real-time analysis but require further study for large-scale HVAC system AFDD [11]. 2.2.3 Semi-supervised methods Semi-supervised learning is beneficial in FDD processes, especially when there's a lack of diverse fault data for training. In this approach, only non-fault class labels are used for initial training, making it more effective than supervised learning when limited faulty samples are available. The training set is iteratively updated by adding new faults, enhancing the model's performance. However, semi-supervised learning has a higher computational cost compared to supervised learning. Yan et al. applied a variety of machine-learning techniques to implement FDD for an Air Handling Unit (AHU) system, determining that that semi-supervised Support Vector Machine (SVM) outperformed other machine-learning techniques considered with 93 % accuracy with minimal faulty samples; as for all such studies, such results need to be contextualized to the particular system under consideration, but this does showcase the potential efficacy of SVM for this system type. It was noted that the SVM accuracy did not increase by adding more faulty samples, showing it to be effective for highly imbalanced training datasets [55]. Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) extensions were later used to synthetically increase the number of faulty training samples, though system configurations required parameter adjustments [71]. More recently, hybrid methods such as Variational Auto-Encoders and Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network with Gradient Penalty [72] and Neighbor-optimized graph convolutional networks [73] have been developed for VRF systems and chiller systems, respectively. 2.2.4 Hybrid methods Hybrid FDD methods that combine supervised and unsupervised learning have emerged to address the limitations of using either approach in isolation. Du et al. [27] used subtractive clustering with a two-layer neural network for AHU fault detection, utilizing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to weigh variables. In another study, Capozzoli et al. [74] employed clustering, CART, and EANN for fault detection in electrical power data. Dey et al. [75] used a multi-class-SVM combined with x-means clustering for diagnosing faults in fan-coil units. Despite the promise, hybrid data-mining approaches for FDD are limited in number and focus mainly on fault detection rather than prediction. Naseri et al. [37] and Piscitelli et al. [76] have extended the hybrid approach to prediction tasks. The right combination of supervised and unsupervised techniques can enhance the accuracy and efficiency of FDD processes [77]. 2.3 Principle of an autoencoder, latent representation, representation learning Deep learning models, based on neural networks, have been shown in some contexts to outperform traditional methods in automatically extracting underlying features from data through representation learning [78], making them particularly useful for process monitoring tasks. Unlike traditional statistical models, deep learning architectures are more flexible and can adapt to various data characteristics. For this type of model, the loss function can be customized to meet specific feature extraction requirements and is often determined by reconstruction error or downstream task loss. While initially computationally expensive, advancements in deep learning frameworks and GPU acceleration, has made the implementation of deep neural networks increasingly practical. Autoencoders (AE) are a type of neural network model specialized in unsupervised features extraction [79]. They have gained traction in Fault Detection and Diagnostics (FDD) due to their strong representation learning capabilities, simple structure, and ease of training. Variants of AEs have been developed to adapt to different data characteristics and to incorporate learned features with specific properties. The encoder-decoder framework, a generalized form of AEs, allows for the integration of other deep learning modules like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for more complex feature extraction [80]. Linear Autoencoders (AEs) share structural similarities with Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a commonly used method in process monitoring. Both models are capable of feature extraction, but AEs offer greater flexibility by allowing the incorporation of nonlinear activation functions. Unlike PCA, this makes AEs more suitable for complex data mining tasks [81]. Kunin et al. [82] further explained the mathematical relationship between linear AEs and PCA, demonstrating that well-trained linear AEs can effectively perform orthogonal projections similar to PCA, especially when L2 regularization is applied. Fig. 2 depicts the architecture of an autoencoder, which is fundamentally divided into an encoder and a decoder. The mathematical formulation of this architecture is as follows: h = f W e x + b e x \u2032 = g W d h + b d In these equations, x and x\u2019 are the input and reconstructed output, respectively, with h being the latent space. We and be are the encoder's weights and bias, while Wd and bd serve the same roles for the decoder. f() and g() are their respective activation functions. The Autoencoder (AE) is optimized through gradient descent on a training set of size N by minimizing a loss function L , which quantifies the reconstruction error below. Upon successful training, the latent space h serves as the feature representation for any given input x. L = 1 N ∑ i = 1 N x i - x \u2032 i 2 Traditional AEs employ a single-layer encoder, limiting their ability to extract deep features. To address this, stacked AEs (SAEs) have been developed. They combine multiple basic AEs in a layer-wise fashion to capture complex features [83]. Another approach to enhance AEs involves modifying the training loss function. Sparse AEs introduce a regularization term to constrain the activation of the hidden layer, making the feature output less sensitive to input noise [84]. Contractive AEs also follow this strategy, using the squared Frobenius norm of the Jacobian matrix as a regularization term [85]. Denoising AEs (DAEs) adopt a different strategy by artificially corrupting the input samples with noise during training, aiming to reconstruct the uncorrupted samples [86]. This makes DAEs particularly robust to noisy inputs. Furthermore, various AE variants can be combined using layer-wise training to create more specialized models like stacked denoising AEs (SDAEs) and sparse stacked AEs (sparse SAEs) [81]. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) extend traditional AEs by using generative and inference networks [87]. Unlike basic AEs, VAEs model features as probability distributions and optimize using variational Bayes methods. The optimization focuses on maximizing the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO). VAEs are particularly noted for their use of a re-parameterization trick to facilitate back-propagation. 2.4 Challenges for using autoencoders in fault detection and diagnosis Latent space in AEs allows for representation learning that captures essential data features serving as industrial knowledge. While these features are often not easily interpretable, they offer a more precise understanding of changes in process information, aiding downstream tasks like fault detection and classification. AEs are commonly used for this purpose due to their strong nonlinear feature extraction capabilities. However, the basic AE model often requires enhancements to handle the complexities of real-world applications data, such as nonlinearity and multi-mode dynamics. Improvements generally focus on training strategies and model structure [81]. In the existing literature, challenges have been identified in using AEs for FDD using BAS data. One primary limitation is that AE-based FDD models often train on incomplete historical data, limiting their efficacy in handling new or different system operation patterns [88]. Additionally, conventional BAS often suffer from limited sensing capabilities, making the AE models poorly generalized [89]. Despite these challenges, there is a noted gap in research on optimizing AE-based FDD methods, specifically in comparing residual-based and latent space-based approaches. The design of the latent space in AE is underlined as an essential factor that ensures further investigation for successful FDD applications [90]. 2.5 Summary of literature review As summarized above, there has been extensive research to apply FDD to HVAC equipment; however, several challenges must be overcome to develop applications suitable for full-building deployment. Regarding fault detection, key challenges include: (1) the lack of available training data, particularly for supervised learning methods; (2) highly imbalanced datasets; (3) difficulty to scale existing approaches to the full-building scale, particularly those reliant on computationally costly algorithms; d) transient fault identification \u2013 methods to identify self-resolving faults are needed to reduce nuisance alarms. In this context, AEs have been demonstrated as having significant promise, particularly for feature extraction but their optimization and testing in full-scale applications is an area requiring significant further research. This paper seeks to resolve this research gap by presenting a novel autoencoder strategy to support scaling and its testing with data extracted from a real-world case study along with a supplementary dataset to better identify fault types requiring additional development. 3 Methodology The experimental part of the study was carried out using data gathered from Fan Coil Units (FCUs) located in the Daphne Cockwell Complex at the Toronto Metropolitan University (TMU) campus, Toronto, Canada. This equipment was selected for three reasons: 1) they are prolific across the building, providing a large dataset; 2) they exist in multiple configurations (e.g. heating & cooling, heating only, cooling only, cooling plus in-slab heating) allowing for future cross-type testing; 3) they are a common type of terminal unit used across a large variety of building types; and 4) their core elements \u2013 a fan, heating and/or cooling coils, coil control valves, and zone temperature control \u2013 are common across a broader range of HVAC equipment. As a result, FCUs will provide the opportunity to test the generalizability and transferability of this approach across systems. If successful, the resultant AE could be rapidly deployed across a large number of buildings. Autoencoders were trained with data collected from five identical FCUs representing the most complex installation in the building. These FCUs consist of cooling and heating coils, each controlled by its own analog valve, and a supply fan. They are further interconnected with a hydronic in-slab heating and cooling system, essentially embedded pipes served by a hydronic pump and control valve. The in-slab system is the primary system but its operation is constrained to limit in-slab temperatures; the FCU thus provides supplemental heating and cooling. Data collection spanned a period of three years with variable occupancy rates (including the Covid-19 lockdown period where there was limited building use for critical research), capturing a dataset that includes room temperature (T), discharge air temperature (DA_T), in-slab temperature (INSLAB_T), outside air temperature (OA_T), as well as command points such as cooling valve output (CLG_O), heating valve output (HTG_O), and temperature set point (T_SP). Each autoencoder was unit-specific and was trained with two-thirds for the data from its FCU. For evaluation, predictions were compared with actual data, using the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) both for individual variables and globally. 3.1 Data pre-processing and feature engineering HVAC controllers typically regulate heating and cooling by measuring the difference between the observed temperature and the set point. It may be challenging with small neural networks to capture this dynamic due to the variability of set points, which are adjusted by users and can significantly vary across different FCUs. To address this, new variables such as dT (room temperature minus its setpoint), dDA_T (discharge air temperature minus the room temperature setpoint) and dINSLAB_T (slab temperature minus the room temperature setpoint) were created. These latter variables emulate the controller's behavior, focusing only on the variance relative to the set point. Following this, all variables are standardized using a min/max scaler to ensure uniform scaling across the dataset. 3.2 Autoencoder design In an autoencoder, the encoder compresses high-dimensional input data into a compact latent representation and then attempts to reconstruct the original data from this compressed form. This method is effective at distilling the core relationships among input variables and filtering out anomalies and noise. During training, the autoencoder's objective is to minimize the error between the input and its reconstruction, ensuring that the latent space encapsulates the essential features of the data. Because of this, selecting the appropriate size for the latent space is crucial. A latent space too large, close to the input size e.g. five or six dimensions in the FCU case, could lead to overfitting where the model merely copies the input data without extracting any features. On the other hand, an excessively small latent space, such as one dimension, might not capture enough information, causing underfitting and poor input reconstruction. The impact of latent space size on the fault detection process is discussed in Section 4.2. Two types of models were designed for this research: equipment-specific (\u2018specific\u2019) and one representing all equipment (\u2018global\u2019). Because the designed AE aims to identify faults in FCUs, training it on data from a single FCU enables it to learn specific operational patterns; however, this could be problematic due to the potential absence of more general patterns. For instance, an FCU conditioning a server room might exhibit more extreme cooling patterns due to constant heat emission from servers, thus overlooking moderate cooling and heating operations. This so-called 'specific' model is better at detecting anomalies from the unit's standard behavior in its usual setting but risks false alarms when encountering new operations, like during server maintenance shutdowns. Conversely, a 'general' model trained on data from multiple FCUs can recognize a wider array of patterns, enhancing its generalization capacity at the expense of missing minor pattern shifts. The effectiveness of both model types in fault detection is evaluated in the experimental section. 3.3 Fault detection A fault is identified by an autoencoder as a deviation from the unit's standard operation. The autoencoder, having learned from historical data, predicts expected values for all variables. Under normal conditions, the reconstruction error \u2014 quantified by MAEs \u2014 is low. However, a significant deviation in the input will result in a corresponding increase in the reconstruction error for the affected variable(s). Fault detection is implemented by comparing the global MAE, the average of all individual MAEs, against a predetermined threshold. An alert is triggered when the global MAE exceeds this threshold, indicating a potential fault. The variable(s) with the highest individual MAE are typically implicated as the root cause of the anomaly. The MAE can serve as a comparative fault score, which is beneficial for monitoring performance across various units or for tracking the operational health of a single unit over time. Rising MAE values may signal deteriorating conditions. To achieve fault detection, the MAE is compared against a threshold. This threshold can be determined by observing data deviations; for example, setting it at a 10 % variation in normalized data. However, this approach is prone to bias. An alternative method is suggested in the following section. 3.4 Fault emulation Fault detection with Autoencoders falls under the umbrella of unsupervised learning. Therefore, there is little or no labeled data available for instances of faults. Due to the rarity of faulty data points, we altered the data to reflect anticipated changes in measurement points for each asset type. To assess the performance of both global and specific models, instances of normal operation as well as faulty ones are required for testing the classification scores. The adopted method involves the use of normal data instances, which are then modified to exhibit specific types of faults. This process includes the following steps: 1. Defining a list of common faults observed in Fan Coil Units (FCUs). 2. Identifying instances that can be modified to emulate these faults. 3. Altering certain sensor measurements to reflect the desired fault. For instance, to emulate a cooling valve that is stuck open, instances where the valve command signal is at 0 % are identified. Subsequently, the room and discharge air temperatures are altered to simulate full cooling conditions. Fig. 3 provides a summary of all potential faults, while Table 1 details the methods for emulating each potential fault. Fault emulation is a random process in which variable alteration is achieved by adding values sampled from a uniform distribution on a predefined interval; this fault emulation is based on expert knowledge of specific fault types. However, not all faults can be emulated given the limited available measurement points. Further, we recognize that this method only covers a subset of potential faults (Fig. 3) that can be inferred from existing sensors and cannot encompass all possible fault scenarios. Test sets are constructed by mixing normal instances in the first half and adding faulty emulated instances to the second half. It is expected that the model will generate higher MAE values for the faulty instances. For classification purposes, these MAE values are compared with a threshold. The model's ability to distinguish between normal and faulty instances is assessed using the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. This curve helps determine the optimal threshold for classification. Subsequently, classification scores are calculated to evaluate the model's performance. Although this process may yield a different threshold for each model, it enables the measurement of the model's best performance and mitigates the bias from arbitrarily selecting a suboptimal threshold. The ROC curve approach is also a general method for finding the optimal threshold, even with a limited set of normal and artificially altered instances. This process can be repeated with new data. A consistent threshold across various data sets is indicative of its reliability as an effective threshold. 3.5 Global model retraining The global model is trained on a wide range of patterns, while the specific model handles a smaller set of observations unique to the location served by the FCU. Consequently, better generalization is expected with the global model, although this comes at the expense of a decreased ability to detect specific patterns that may require attention in the particular location. In scenarios with limited historical data, deploying the global model is the only option for a new FCU setup. This model detects general patterns and is then retrained to become more sensitive to the specific area's patterns. This situation raises several questions: (1) How many months of data are required to retrain the global model to achieve adequate sensitivity to specific patterns; and (2) How many epochs of retraining per month are necessary to avoid overfitting to the new data? It is presumed that the global model for each FCU is never initially trained on data from that specific location. To explore this, a set of experiments was conducted where each global model was retrained using data from the specific location for 12 months, with a range of 1 to 10 epochs. The accuracy for various fault types was measured, and statistics were calculated for each month and number of retraining epochs. The results were then compared with the performance of the specific model. 4 Results This results section explores the ability of both global and specific models to identify actual detected and emulated faults. It also examines the role of the autoencoder's latent representation in distinguishing between normal and faulty behaviors. Additionally, the section explores the specifics of retraining general models to recognize patterns unique to certain locations. 4.1 Fault prediction with global and specific models Fig. 4 depicts a comparison between the global and specific models with both real and predicted data. The general model (Mg) and the specific model (Ms) have distinct approaches to handling sensor measurements. Mg shows fewer instances with high MAE, possibly overlooking some unusual patterns in the room context such as unusual temperature readings. Ms, in contrast, displays higher MAE levels. This indicates a higher sensitivity, which can be advantageous in detecting more faults but may also lead to false alarms by mistaking normal conditions for faults. One of the key challenges with the specific model (Ms) in Fig. 4 is its limited exposure to heating patterns during training. This lack of diverse data causes Ms to sometimes incorrectly identify heating as an anomaly, a problem evident in the heating season (November-December 2023 data). Mg, with a broader training dataset, correctly categorizes heating instances as normal. In this figure, the issue of threshold selection can be clearly seen. Using arbitrary thresholds for fault detection, can result in a high rate of false positives. The threshold selection method will be further discussed in section 4.3. 4.2 Autoencoder internal representation as an asset health indicator The autoencoder\u2019s internal representation, or the latent space, can be useful in revealing the tolerance levels for various variables. This helps to understand how far the current observations are from the fault boundary, thus indicating the \u201chealth status\u201d of an FCU. By analyzing these tolerance levels, it is possible to visualize the permissible changes in each variable that could lead the global MAE (average of all MAE values) to reach the critical threshold. As such, fault detection can be conceptualized not just as a binary classification (faulty or not faulty) but as a graduated scale. This approach allows for a more nuanced understanding of the FCU's condition. Different zones can be defined based on the MAE threshold, such as a green zone (0 % to 50 % MAE threshold), an orange zone (50 % to 80 % MAE threshold), and a red zone (above 80 % MAE threshold). Fig. 5 illustrates this concept by showing the permissible variation for each monitored variable under normal conditions, marked with a red asterisk. By applying the autoencoder model to the current sensor measurements, all variables are kept constant except for one, which is changed. This approach reveals the extent of variation each variable can tolerate before triggering the critical MAE threshold. For instance, Fig. 5 indicates that the heating valve command (HTG_O) is within the normal range when it varies between 0 % and 42 %, while the room temperature (T) is considered normal between 20 °C and 24 °C, provided all other variables remain unchanged. 4.3 Fault emulation Fig. 6 presents the results from two models of the same FCU: the global model (Mg) on the left and the specific model (Ms) on the right. The test set is divided into two halves; the first contains normal observations while the second comprises emulated faults of type CV1 (cooling valve stuck open), exhibiting lower discharge air temperature (DA_T) values. Mg identified DA_T as the only faulty variable, slightly increasing the MAE. In contrast, Ms flagged the room temperature (T) as higher than normal in the context of the cool DA_T, which marked a clear deviation from normal for DA_T. Additionally, Ms predicted that such conditions should trigger heating, with HTG_O predicted above 80 %. The MAE resulting from these three deviations is significantly higher than that of Mg. Comparing these MAE values with the threshold shows a more accurate classification using the specific model than the global one. The optimal threshold for the autoencoder is determined using the ROC curve, as shown in Fig. 7 for both Mg and Ms. This curve indicates that Ms is more effective at differentiating between normal and faulty instances, as shown by its higher Area Under the Curve (AUC). The optimal threshold is identified with the help of the ROC curve as the point closest to (0,1). This threshold is applied in all subsequent classifications based on MAE. The classification results in Table 2 indicate that, with very few exceptions, the specific model consistently outperforms the global model across different FCUs and fault types. Fig. 8 provides a graphical comparison of both models' accuracy, with the specific model frequently achieving scores above 90 %. Data for fault 2 was excluded due to the lack of sufficient heating patterns for some FCUs. 4.4 Global model retraining In the context of these experiments, the global model serves as a foundational model for locations where initially little to no data is available for fault detection. This model is subsequently retrained with new data to learn the location-specific patterns and improve accuracy. A key question that arises is how many epochs of retraining are necessary to match the accuracy of the general model with that of the specific model in practical applications. To address this question, Mg is retrained for a range of epochs, from 1 to 10, for each month of data. Fig. 9 displays the median accuracy across all FCUs and faults. It shows that retraining the global model with a high number of epochs does not necessarily enhance performance (indicating overfitting). An optimal trade-off is achieved at epoch 2, where the overall best performance is observed. Fig. 10 illustrates that for the optimal number of retraining epochs (2 epochs), the performance of the global model consistently improves after each month of retraining. However, certain months (such as months 5 and 11) have a negative impact on the F1-score. This could be attributed to the presence of low-quality data, which may degrade the models performance, although it generally remains above that of the global model. 5 Discussion In our paper, we have studied two models: a specific model and a global model. The specific model is trained on data from a single FCU to detect deviations specific to that unit's behavior. While this model is sensitive to unit-specific outliers, it may trigger false alarms if the unit's operational characteristics change. This is a significant limitation of the specific model; however, it can be overcome to a degree when used alongside the global model because the latter is trained on data from multiple FCUs, allowing it to capture broader operational patterns. This model is more effective at distinguishing between normal variations and actual faults, thereby reducing the risk of false positives. The autoencoder stands out for its simplicity and efficiency in fault detection as it is capable of learning multiple relationships between asset variables. This ability allows it to take over the role of multiple separate predictors and identify complex, non-linear interactions among the asset components. The choice of input variables for the autoencoder is significantly influenced by expert knowledge of the asset control operations, such as choosing to use the temperature difference between the room and the setpoint \u2013 or error \u2013 rather than the temperature alone. This decision reflects the understanding of heating and cooling systems' operations. In some cases, using the derivative and integral of this error as additional inputs could further enhance the model effectiveness. Notably, the autoencoder's design does not rely on temporal data, which greatly simplifies its use in real-time FDD monitoring systems or even on edge devices. Despite this, there is potential to explore variations that incorporate time as an additional input to possibly improve its predictive capability. The general model's lower sensitivity to specific asset faults, while still capturing critical issues, makes it an ideal candidate for initial deployment in new settings where historical data is not available. Its performance can be evaluated over a few weeks to monitor for false alarms before full production deployment. Regular retraining cycles help to refine its accuracy over time. Nonetheless, the autoencoder has its limitations. Because it does not use temporal data, it cannot readily detect time-related faults or deviations, such as gradual leaks or the gradual reduction in speed of supply fans. Integrating the autoencoder with other neural networks models capable of analyzing time-series data, for example Fully Convolutional Neural Networks (FCNs) or LSTMs, may offer a solution to this challenge. Another challenge is the requirement for at least one year's worth of data to effectively train the autoencoder to ensure it captures the full cycle of heating and cooling patterns. Starting with a global model as a baseline for each type of FCU can address this issue and allow for gradual adaptation and refinement as more equipment-specific data is collected. The FDD approach with autoencoders is based on measuring the average MAE that quantifies the discrepancy between the model's predictions and the actual observations. Identifying the optimal MAE threshold to separate normal from faulty instances is one the challenges observed in this research. The proposed solution involves generating emulated faults based on expert knowledge and using methods like the ROC curve to find the most effective threshold. This technique helps to address the common problem with unsupervised learning models \u2013 the absence of labeled data. However, the reliability of this threshold depends largely on the quality and diversity of fault emulation data. This paper introduces a method to mitigate this issue by considering a broad spectrum of potential faults to obtain an optimal threshold. A considerable fluctuation in the calculated threshold might indicate a problem with the simulated faults' generation process. The design of the autoencoder poses its own set of challenges, particularly in deciding the size of its internal representation, which greatly affects the model's performance. To identify the best size, different models were tested against the test set to select the best performing one. This crucial step ensures the autoencoder is finely tuned to accurately capture the asset's operational dynamics, thereby enhancing its fault detection efficiency. 6 Conclusions This paper examined the effectiveness of autoencoders for fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) in HVAC systems, with an emphasis on two distinct models: a specific model trained exclusively on data from a particular location and a global model trained on data from multiple locations. The study demonstrated that both models could classify faulty instances accurately, though the specific model proved to be slightly more accurate. It was further shown that retraining the global model with an optimal number of epochs could increase its performance to match that of the specific model, which suggests that extending this for transfer learning could prove valuable and is recommended future research. The research also revealed that the quality of the data used in retraining affects the model's performance, thus highlighting the necessity for a data quality check before retraining. This study positioned the global model as a foundational model for an asset, obtained by training it on a wide range of patterns from different locations. This approach allows the model to learn the basic operation of the asset and then refine its sensitivity to the specifics of each location. Such retraining refines the performance of the global model while retaining the initial learning acquired from the global dataset. The paper further proposed a method for evaluating the performance of autoencoders within the framework of unsupervised learning. This method involves identifying all potential faults in HVAC assets, identifying patterns that could lead to these faults, and then simulating faults by altering observed variables in a randomized manner. Moreover, the study suggested that autoencoder performance could be enhanced by incorporating more engineered variables derived from asset behavior such as selected previous observations of sensors to allow the model to learn from past time series patterns. Although this research offers many contributions, it also highlights limitations within the existing methodology and proposes directions for further research. Enhancing the autoencoder with engineered variables to improve fault detection accuracy presents one direction for development. Future studies could explore the integration of these variables, as well as the association of autoencoders with complementary neural networks that can capture time series patterns. The aim is to advance the development of reliable and efficient FDD systems that can adapt to the complexities of modern HVAC systems and ensure their sustained optimal performance.

        "dc:description": "This paper explores the application of autoencoder algorithms in Automated Fault Detection (AFD) for Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems, specifically focusing on Fan Coil Units (FCUs). The study begins by reviewing the current state of Fault Detection and Diagnostics (FDD), emphasizing the limitations and the potential of unsupervised learning techniques like autoencoders and transfer learning to fill these gaps. Using data from a full-scale building case study featuring five Fan Coil Units (FCUs), the research develops and evaluates autoencoder-based AFD models that models effectively compress multivariate inputs into a reduced latent space, enabling accurate and efficient fault detection. The paper makes two novel contributions: (1) It introduces a methodology to distinguish between equipment-level and system-level faults; and (2) It demonstrates the generalizability of the approach across different types of FCUs through cross-testing and transfer learning. The results indicate that autoencoders outperform other dimensionality reduction algorithms and separate predictors in fault detection accuracy and efficiency. The paper concludes by discussing the implications of these findings for future research and practical applications in building management.",
