Handling editor: X Zhao Centralized air-conditioning systems are widely considered a major energy consumer with high energy flexibility, contributing to renewable penetration and power system regulation. Nevertheless, a lack of understanding of their system components' abilities limits the utilization of their full potential. Hereby, we took the centralized air-conditioning systems of two hub airports as typical examples and quantified their energy flexibility potential by cooling load reduction potential ( q max ), cooling energy storage capacity (Q), based on field test. Cooling plants had the highest potential ( q max = 70\u2013110 Wc/m2; Q = 500∼1500 Whc/m2), followed by terminal devices with building thermal mass ( q max = 2\u201311 Wc/m2; Q = 10\u201340 Whc/m2) and transmission & distribution networks ( q max = 50\u2013200 Wc/m2; Q = 10\u201320 Whc/m2). Various air-conditioning terminal devices utilize building thermal mass to different degrees. During the investigation, the conventional all-air system used 7.8 %∼18.7 % of the building's thermal capacity, whereas that of the radiant floor system significantly increased to 38.9 %∼48.3 %. Consequently, the systems of the hub airports can participate in demand response programs with a cooling load reduction of 2∼15 MWe, for 6\u201320 h using different operating strategies. These findings shed light on demand-side flexibility characterization and exploitation to support a decarbonized energy system.

Currently, renewable energy has accounted for more than 30 % of annual electricity generation in China [2]. However, integrating renewable energy, such as photovoltaics (PV), into power systems poses new challenges, because its inherent uncertainty exacerbates the imbalance between supply and demand [3]. To address this issue, demand-side flexibility becomes crucial. Heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, accounting for over 50 % of building CO2 emissions [4], and over 40 % of building energy use [5], are widely regarded as one of the most potential virtual energy storage (VES) on the demand side [6]. As a typical large-scale case, the HVAC systems of airports attract much of researchers' and engineers\u2019 attention on energy efficiency and flexibility improvement [7], since a hub airport is just as a small city with extremely high total energy consumption [8] and considerable on-site renewable generation potential energy [9]. There are many potential energy storage resources in a centralized air-conditioning system of an airport to improve its energy flexibility, as shown in Fig. 1 [10]. The cooling plant is usually equipped with water or ice storage tanks for peak shaving and valley filling of the load. The chilled water transmission & distribution system in an airport commonly has large networks with a distance scale of 0.01\u201310 km. A certain amount of thermal energy can be stored when the water temperature varies within an acceptable range. Moreover, various terminal devices in the terminal building with multiple indoor spaces can activate the building thermal mass (BTM) to different degrees for passive energy storage. Many researchers have investigated the energy flexibility of cooling plants, particularly those that incorporate active thermal energy storage (TES) components, such as water and ice tanks. These TES systems are commonly used in centralized air-conditioning systems, especially for airports [11,12]. Chinese standards [13] recommend equipping energy storage systems with a capacity of at least 30 % of the daily cooling load in airports due to the high energy consumption of air-conditioning systems [14]. Shi et al. [15] analyzed the performance of ice storage systems, ice slurry storage systems, and water storage systems in an international airport based on the local time-of-use tariff policy. The results revealed that the water storage system can reduce 51.3 % of the annual operation cost, which surpasses the performance of ice storage and ice slurry storage. Ahmed et al. [16] pointed out that the configurations of water tanks can further enhance the thermal performance and storage of water tanks. Additionally, tank storage can be combined with other technologies, like sorption-assisted water storage [17] and phase change material (PCM) [18]. The transmission and distribution networks with inside cold/hot water can also be regarded as TES. For example, in a district heating system in Poland [19], utilizing the district heating network with the buildings can achieve a total reduction in the heat output of the heat source for central heating of 16.2 MW with a compensation time of 24 h, and 11.4 MW with a compensation time of 48 h. By complementing network systems with other TES devices such as water tanks, the stored energy capacity can reach 10\u201350 MWh for short-term events and 50\u20131000 MWh for long-term events [20]. Furthermore, a higher temperature difference between the supply and return water results in a larger energy flexibility potential of the networks; thus, heating networks commonly have greater energy flexibility than cooling networks [21]. However, there is a lack of separate quantification of energy flexibility potential in networks and building structures. Another research focus is improving the energy flexibility of centralized air-conditioning systems by utilizing BTM. BTM refers to the thermal storage ability of the building structure [22], and the definition can be extended to furniture and other indoor objects [23]. For example, Xu et al. [24] applied a pre-cooling strategy for a commercial building, which used BTM to store the cooling energy in advance. The measurements showed an 80 % reduction in peak load without any complaints from occupants. In recent years, cooling and heating strategies utilizing BTM [25] and exploring the effect on thermal comfort [26] have drawn increasing attention. A simulation study conducted in Saudi Arabia indicated that heavy thermal mass has a significant effect on energy saving for buildings without heating or cooling because it regulates and time-shifts the peak internal temperatures [27]. Pre-cooling strategies have been proven to be effective in reducing peak loads in response to extreme weather conditions or electricity tariffs. The pre-cooling strategy in housing buildings can increase the potential peak demand reduction, compromising thermal comfort demand [28]. However, the peak load reduction can be achieved without hazarding thermal comfort with rooftop PV [29]. The pre-cooling approach is also an effective preventive measure in anticipation of an upcoming heat wave [30]. Room temperature resetting is another recognized passive demand response control strategy. The technology of room temperature resetting can set the zone temperature to the upper limit, utilizing the control range of temperature parameters. Aduda et al. [31] indicated that room temperature reset by 2 °C can reduce peak load by up to 25 % of the maximum cooling power demand during a continuous operation for roughly 20 min. In addition to the building thermal mass storage, the flexibility of furnishing thermal mass has been unveiled by recent research [32]. In an office building scenario, furnishing thermal mass provides considerable energy flexibility, leading to a 50 % reduction in peak load [23]. Additionally, combining the building thermal mass with PCMs has shown promising results in reducing the peak load and energy consumption of HVAC systems [33,34]. Despite many previous studies on BTM, few pay attention to the influence of air-conditioning terminal devices on how much BTM can be used for energy flexibility, for example, comparing conventional all-air systems and radiant floors widely used in large-space airport terminals [35]. Demand response (DR) programs are essential drivers for end-users to utilize the energy storage resources mentioned above for energy flexibility. DR is a grid-interactive technology, referring to changes in demand-side energy usage from normal patterns in response to electricity price or grid instruction. Building DR strategies can be categorized into five groups: load shifting, load shedding, generation, efficiency, and modulating [36]. Various applications of DR have been proposed, such as direct-load control, time-of-use price, and demand bidding [37]. Since these DR projects involve different services, objectives, and market trading rules, parameters for energy flexibility can be viewed from the perspectives of power, energy, and temporality [38,39]. The potential of DR in promoting photovoltaic power [40] and wind power [41] has been proved. Thus, DR is integrated with robust control of commercial buildings to adjust energy usage [42], in which HVAC-related loads offer a high potential for DR [43]. Among these loads, some can be shifted [44], and some can be shaved [45]. Existing studies about building DR mostly centered on simulation or small-scale experiments of non-residential buildings [46] and residential buildings [47]. However, few studies used long-term field test data to explore the energy flexibility potential of air-conditioning systems, especially for a large-scale centralized system, such as one in an airport. In summary of the literature mentioned above, key points can be drawn: (1) There is a lack of field test data to reveal the energy flexibility potential of large-scale centralized air-conditioning systems and their system components. (2) The influence of HVAC terminal devices on using building thermal mass for energy flexibility has yet to be clarified. The contribution of this paper can be summarized as follows: (1) We addressed the research gap by evaluating large-scale centralized air-conditioning systems and quantifying the energy flexibility potential of various components. (2) We examined the factors influencing the utilization of the flexibility resource, with a focus on the terminal devices. (3) Our study revealed the considerable potential for large-scale HVAC systems to participate in demand response and presented parameters for grid interaction. The structure of this paper is as follows. Section 2 introduces the field investigation information and the energy flexibility metrics for quantitative analysis. Section 3 presents the calculative results of flexibility in airports. Section 4 discusses the influence factors and DR potential. The main findings are summarized in Section 5. 2 Methodology 2.1 Field investigation To evaluate the energy flexibility of centralized air-conditioning systems, we conducted large-scale investigations on two international hub airports in China. The basic information of the two airports is presented in Table 1 . The views and schematics of their air-conditioning system are shown in Fig. 2 . The field investigation method can refer to our previously published work [48]. The two airports applied different terminal devices, which activated the BTM of the airport terminal buildings to different degrees. The investigated terminal building of Airport A was equipped with all-air systems with jet ventilation. In contrast, the terminal building of Airport B applied radiant floor cooling systems with displacement ventilation. The investigation includes data from Airport A (Aug. 5\u201313, 2022) and Airport B (Jun. 2-Aug. 31, 2022). The parameters of the instruments used for the investigation are listed in Table 2 . 2.2 Energy flexibility metrics Two parameters were introduced to comprehensively describe the energy flexibility of centralized air-conditioning systems in the two airports. These parameters included cooling load reduction potential and cooling energy storage capacity. The first parameter is cooling load reduction potential ( q max , Wc/m2 or MWc), defined as Eq. (1). (1) q max , [ τ 1 , τ 2 ] = max { q ( τ ) } , τ ∈ [ τ 1 , τ 2 ] where q signifies the cooling load (Wc/m2 or MWc); τ 1 represents the start time of regulation (h); τ 2 represents the end time of regulation(h). The second parameter is cooling energy storage capacity ( Q , Whc/m2 or MWhc), defined as Eq. (2). (2) Q [ τ 1 , τ 2 ] = ∫ τ 1 τ 2 q ( τ ) d τ The cooling load reduction potential and cooling energy storage capacity are calculated in cooling energy. These two parameters can be converted to equivalent electricity load reduction potential ( P , MWe), and equivalent electricity energy storage capacity ( E , MWhe) according to Eqs. (3) and (4) respectively. (3) P = q max C O P (4) E = Q C O P The visual explanations of cooling load reduction potential ( q max ), cooling energy storage capacity ( Q ), equivalent electricity load reduction potential ( P ), and equivalent electricity energy storage capacity ( E ) are shown in Fig. 3 . The regulation time interval [ τ 1 , τ 2 ] is decided by grid instruction or operation schedule. During the regulation, the cooling plant temporarily stopped the cooling load supply, as shown in Fig. 3 (a). Consequently, the electricity load of the chillers was shaved during the regulation, as in Fig. 3 (b). The two aforementioned parameters were applied to each component of an air-conditioning system, including storage tanks, transmission & distribution networks, and terminal devices. Units per floor area are used for these two parameters to facilitate comparisons between different buildings. However, the definition of regulation span should be clarified for these components. The following sections define the regulation span and calculation method of the load of each system component, respectively. 2.2.1 Metrics for tanks In the airports, the tanks shifted the cooling load from peak to non-peak period by storing and releasing the chilled water. The cooling load reduction potential and cooling energy storage capacity of tanks were calculated as Eqs. (5) and (6): (5) q t a n k , [ τ 1 , τ 2 ] = max { G c p [ t r ( τ ) − t s ( τ ) ] } , τ ∈ [ τ 1 , τ 2 ] (6) Q t a n k , [ τ 1 , τ 2 ] = ρ c p V t a n k | t t a n k \u203e ( τ 1 ) − t t a n k \u203e ( τ 2 ) | where the q t a n k represents the cooling load reduction potential of tanks (Wc/m2 or MWc); G denotes the mass flow rate of chilled water (kg/s); c p describes the specific thermal capacity of the chilled water (J/(kg·K)); t r indicates the temperature of the return water (°C); t s indicates the temperature of the supply water (°C); t t a n k \u203e is the average temperature of the chilled water in tanks (°C); V t a n k represents the volume of chilled water in tanks (m3). 2.2.2 Metrics for transmission & distribution network The energy flexibility in transmission & distribution networks is primarily related to the thermal capacity of chilled water. The pipeline volume ranges from 1 % to 3 % of the volume of the water tanks. It can be utilized separately from chillers or water tanks. The cooling load of the network is similar to the cooling load of tanks. The definitions of cooling load reduction potential and cooling energy storage capacity for networks are corrected as Eqs. (7) and (8) respectively. (7) q t & d , [ τ 1 , τ 2 ] = G c p ( t r , d − t c h i l l ) (8) Q t & d , [ τ 1 , τ 2 ] = ( τ 2 − τ 1 ) G c p ( t r , d − t c h i l l ) where t c h i l l represents the chilled water temperature during the regulation time interval (°C). Due to the rapid cooling load release process, we use instantaneous sampling temperature instead of continuous data series. 2.2.3 Metrics for terminal devices with building thermal mass The energy flexibility potential of terminal devices with building thermal mass is activated by adjusting the air temperature, which allows the building fabrics to release the cooling load. The function of cooling load reduction potential for terminal devices is expressed in Eq. (9) [20]. (9) q t e r m i n a l = max { ∑ k h k A k [ t k ( τ ) − t a ( τ ) ] } , τ ∈ [ τ 1 , τ 2 ] where q t e r m i n a l represents cooling load reduction potential of terminal devices (Wc/m2 or MWc); k refers to the surface k; h k denotes the convective heat transfer coefficients between surface k and indoor air (W/(m2·K)); A k stands for the area of surface k (m2); t k represents the temperature of the surface k (m2); t a signifies the temperature of indoor air (°C). In this work, the surfaces include the external wall, indoor wall, furniture, and floor. The cooling energy storage capacity of terminal devices is defined as Eq. (10). (10) Q t e r m i n a l = ∫ τ 1 τ 2 ∑ k h k A k [ t k ( τ ) − t a ( τ ) ] d τ During the cooling load release process of terminal devices, indoor thermal demand mainly restricts the time span. Based on the practical operation in terminal buildings, the design indoor temperature is set at 24 °C, with an upper limit set beforehand. The end time of regulation is defined as the moment when the indoor temperature reaches the upper limit. At that time, the air-conditioning system would begin running. Furthermore, to assess the influence of different terminal devices on energy flexibility, potential thermal capacity C e and Equivalent thermal capacity C v are introduced, expressed in Eqs. (11) and (12). (11) C v = ∑ j ρ j c p , j V j where j refers to material j in the thermal mass; ρ j is the density of material j (kg/m3); c p , j is the specific thermal capacity of material j (J/(kg·K)); V j is the volume of material j (m3). (12) C e d t i d τ = t o − t i R e + L − H where t i is indoor temperature (°C); τ is time (h); t o is outdoor temperature (°C); H is internal heat resource (W/m2); R e is the equivalent thermal resistance of terminal buildings (K/(W·m2)). Eq. (8) applied a simplified equivalent thermal parameters model to describe the thermal performance of terminal devices. The ordinary least square method is utilized to evaluate the parameters pair ( C e , R e ) with input data ( t o , t i , Q h , Q ), where each component of input data is a sequential series. 3 Results 3.1 Energy flexibility of each system component The temperature profiles in Airports A and B are depicted in Fig. 4 (a) and (b). The gray-colored area means that most air-conditioning devices in terminal buildings are not working during this time. For Airport A, the outdoor temperature during Aug. 9\u201311 was consistently higher than the indoor temperature, with peaks of 40 °C (6K higher than the design outdoor temperature). The outdoor temperature peak during the investigation of Airport B also met the design outdoor temperature of 29.4 °C. Fig. 4 (c) and (d) present the cooling energy transfer between tanks, chillers, and terminal buildings. For both airports, the tanks were charged by the chillers during nighttime. In the daytime, the chillers and the tanks jointly provided cooling energy for terminal buildings. Chilled water was produced in advance and prepared for the upcoming day. As a result, the electricity load of the chillers can be partly shifted to the nighttime, as is shown in Fig. 4 (e) and (f). The COP of Airports A and B are 2.5 and 2.4, respectively, calculated from the data. 3.1.1 Cooling plant The cooling plants in the investigated air-conditioning systems serve as cooling sources and chilled water distributors. Water storage tanks in the airports allow for flexible operation of the cooling plants, as depicted in Fig. 5 . The water storage tanks in both airports are charged at nighttime (around 22:00\u20136:00 for Airport A and around 23:00\u20138:00 for Airport B). The specific charging and discharging schedule of the water storage tanks is depicted in Fig. 6 . Fig. 6 (a) displays the energy storage profile of the tanks in airport A from Aug 9\u201311. The charging process typically began between 23:00 and 24:00, depending on the last flight scheduled for the day. The discharging process began at 6:40 to provide chilled water to the terminal building. Over consecutive days, the cooling energy stored in the tanks was gradually used up, with the daily utilization close to the designed capacity of 450 MWhc. In contrast, Fig. 6 (b) illustrates the energy storage profile of the tanks in Airport B on Jun. 24 (Day 1), Jun. 25 (Day 2), and Aug. 13 (Day 3). On Jun. 24 (Day 1), the tanks fulfilled the cooling demand independently from the chillers and utilized a significant portion of the designed storage capacity (230 MWhc). On Jun. 25 (Day 2), the stored cooling load remained an unused portion in preparation for the upcoming day. On Aug. 13 (Day 3), the tank released the cooling load from 9:00 to 23:00, with a lower release rate at noon due to additional cooling load managed by the chillers during peak hours. The tanks\u2019 regulation time span lasts roughly one day, encompassing the charging process in the nighttime and the discharging process in the daytime. Fig. 7 presents the profile of the cumulative cooling load and the peak cooling load over each cooling load release interval. In this figure, regulation time interval [ τ 1 , τ 2 ] are selected to be [7:00, 22:00] for both airports, according to the operation schedule, and validated by the data. In Fig. 7 (a), it can be observed that the tanks in Airport A contributed to more than 50 % of the daily cooling load for most days. On the other hand, in Airport B, the tanks contributed to more than 50 % of the cooling load almost every day, as indicated in Fig. 7 (b). The energy storage ( Q ) of tanks in Airport A and Airport B reached 500 MWhc and 247 MWhc, respectively, which are both slightly exceeding the designed storage. Additionally, the cooling load reduction potential ( q max ) in Airports A and B were 110 Wc/m2 and 78 Wc/m2, respectively. The results show that the water storage tanks serve as the primary thermal energy storage in both air-conditioning systems. 3.1.2 Transmission & distribution network Table 3 shows the energy flexibility performance of the network. The network had a cooling energy storage capacity exceeding 15 Whc/m2 and a cooling load reduction potential of over 150 Wc/m2, which should not be overlooked. The cooling load reduction potential depends on the rated flow and chilled water temperature, while the cooling energy storage capacity depends on the volume and chilled water temperature. When the chilled water temperature rises, the stored cooling load in the network is released. During this process, the heat transfer capacity of the network decreases, leading to an increase in the indoor air temperature. This increase can further activate the function of terminal devices with building thermal mass, which means the energy flexibility in networks is typically coupled with terminal devices. 3.1.3 Terminal devices with building thermal mass From 24:00 to 6:00, the 15.5/20.5 °C chillers provided a cooling load of 12 Wc/m2 for the terminal building of Airport A. The terminal building of Airport B was equipped with radiant cooling systems, in which the circulating water is periodically mixed with chilled water every two to three days. Indoor air temperature was allowed to increase by 2\u20133 K at nighttime when there were no cooling sources from the cooling plant. The heat flow between building materials and indoor air is shown in Fig. 8 . The detailed charging and discharging profiles of building thermal mass are depicted in Fig. 8 (a) and (b). For Airports A and B, the cooling load reduction potential reached 1.7 Wc/m2 and 10 Wc/m2, respectively. The temperature difference between the air and the surfaces significantly influenced the thermal performance of terminal devices. In the case of Airport B, the floor temperature became an essential factor, in addition to the indoor air temperature. For example, on Aug. 20 (Day 2), the cooling load reached 10 Wc/m2 as the floor temperature was approximately 20 °C\u201322.5 °C. In contrast, during Aug. 19 (Day 1) and Aug. 21 (Day 3), the cooling load was around 5 Wc/m2 as the floor temperature hovers between 21 °C\u201323 °C. For both airports, the air-conditioning system began to operate after 4:00, and the indoor air temperature returned to the set point. Fig. 9 presents the quantification of energy flexibility for terminal devices with building thermal mass. The cooling load reduction values for Airports A and B were 2.7 Wc/m2 and 10.4 Wc/m2, respectively. The cooling energy storage capacity values of Airports A and B reached 13.8 Wc/m2 and 39.3 Wc/m2, respectively. It is worth mentioning that while both Airport A and Airport B had building fabric with similar energy storage capacities (around 14 Whc/m2), the terminal devices in Airport B offered four times more storage than those in Airport A, thanks to the floor radiant cooling system. 3.2 Overall energy flexibility The cooling load reduction and storage capacity of different components in airports appear in Fig. 10 . The \u201cpotential\u201d points were calculated under the design condition, whereas each \u201cinvestigated\u201d point represents the daily investigation results. The average cooling energy storage capacity of Airport A - investigated and Airport B - investigated was 1.08 MWhe and 5.40 MWhe, respectively. Moreover, the average cooling load reduction potential of \u201cAirport A - investigated\u201d and \u201cAirport B - investigated\u201d was 0.27 MWe and 1.38 MWe, respectively. The utilized terminal devices potential for Airport A and Airport B is only 5.4 % and 27 %. The cooling plant shows the largest response time in design case (2h\u201310h), followed by the terminal devices (1.5h ∼ 4h) and network (0.05h\u20130.2h). The results revealed that the daily operation of the air-conditioning system can affect the flexibility performance. For the cooling plant, the investigated points cluster around the potential point, indicating that the use of tanks conforms to the design case in both airports. Regarding the transmission & distribution network, the flexibility performance of investigated points is close to that of potential points, similarly. However, the potential of terminal devices with building thermal mass was underutilized. The potential points indicate the energy flexibility potential of components in the air-conditioning system in the design case. However, these points move away from their original position when the condition varies. For example, let's consider a scenario where the outdoor temperature is higher. In this scenario, the points for the transmission & distribution network and cooling plants would go vertically up because the cooling load rises. The points for terminal devices would move left and up because more cooling load can be released during the discharging phase, while less cooling energy can be stored during the charging phase. 4 Discussions 4.1 Influence of air-conditioning terminal devices This section compared the impact of different centralized air-conditioning terminal devices on energy flexibility performance. Fig. 11 illustrates the temperature distribution and variation in both airports. Although a wide temperature distribution range existed within each region of the airports, the overall trend generally remained consistent. The average value could reflect the temperature changes in both airports. In Airport A, there was a notable amplitude of 2K for the observed peaks during the 0:00\u20136:00 period, whereas in Airport B, the amplitude of peaks was comparatively lower, measuring below 1.2K. The discrepancy could be attributed, in part, to the implementation of radiant cooling systems, which helped mitigate temperature fluctuations, although Airport A experienced higher outdoor temperatures than Airport B. Notably, the nighttime cooling load released by the radiant cooling systems and thermal mass could achieve 10.8 Wc/m2 in Airport B, which was close to the nighttime cooling load from chillers in Airport A (approximately 12 Wc/m2). The equivalent thermal capacity and potential thermal capacity of the two airports were evaluated to compare the influence of different terminal devices. The equivalent thermal capacity was derived from investigative data, and the potential thermal capacity was calculated from the building structure. As is presented in Fig. 12 , the potential thermal capacity in Airport A and Airport B reached 2.55 × 105 J/(m2·K) and 2.69 × 105 J/(m2·K), respectively. However, the equivalent thermal capacity of terminal buildings in Airport A and Airport B was 3.38 × 104 J/(m2·K) and 1.17 × 105 J/(m2·K), respectively. The conventional all-air systems utilized 7.8 %∼18.7 % of the building's thermal capacity, whereas that of the radiant floor systems significantly increased to 38.9 %∼48.3 %. One possible reason for the difference is that the radiant floor system can further utilize the potential of the building fabric. When the radiant cooling water releases the cooling load in the daytime, the temperature of the building envelope decreases until it reaches the indoor setpoint, allowing the radiant floor system to store cooling energy in the terminal buildings. As a result, building envelopes with radiant floors can have greater and longer effects when the terminal building temperature increases. 4.2 Demand response (DR) potential This section discusses the potential of centralized air-conditioning systems participating in DR programs. The load participated in DR programs could be around 10MWe, which equals the power generation capacity of a small power plant. Fig. 13 shows the DR potential for both airports according to investigation data. In the first stage, the chillers are shut down. The fully charged energy storage tanks in the cooling plant could replace the chillers or collaborate with the chillers as a cooling source. This allowed the indoor air temperature in terminal buildings to be maintained at the design value. The duration of this first stage depended on the usage of the storage systems and typically lasted for about 5\u201315 h. As the storage in the cooling plant used up, the process entered the second stage. In this stage, the indoor temperature began to increase, along with the chilled water temperature. This indicated that the transmission & distribution network and terminal building thermal mass worked together to mitigate the rise in room temperature. Within the first hour, the room temperature gradually exceeded the surface temperature, resulting in the release of the cooling load from the building thermal mass. This stage typically lasts for approximately 2\u20135 h. Generally, this stage could provide 10 %\u201325 % DR potential as the first stage can. During the investigation, the storage tanks were planned to work for the majority of the daytime, and the energy flexibility of terminal devices was used at nighttime when the outdoor temperature was relatively low. In the days investigated, Airport A had a response time ranging from 17.6 to 21.1 h (19.9 h on average). On the other hand, Airport B had a response time ranging from 10.3 to 18.8 h (14.0 h on average). This operation did not utilize both components' cooling load reduction potential to their maximum extent, resulting in a long response time for the tanks and terminal devices. If the systems were running under the design case, the cooling load reduction potential could be higher, and the response time could be shortened. The response time for the tanks and terminal devices at Airport A would be 5.2 h and 1.6 h, respectively. For Airport B, the response times would be 12.2 h for the tanks and 2.3 h for the terminal devices. To enhance the interaction with the power grid for large-scale air-conditioning system operations, we propose prioritizing the use of active energy storage devices over passive flexibility resources. This recommendation is based on several key advantages: (1) Active energy storage devices, such as water tanks, offer prompt and user-friendly operation compared to passive resources. (2) The impact on user thermal comfort demands can be minimized by utilizing active storage devices first. (3) The storage capacity of tanks provides advantages over other components in the system. Moreover, the analysis reveals that Airport A currently maintains a flexibility ratio of passive to active components at approximately 10 %, aligning closely with the findings of Chen et al. [20]. However, there is potential to increase this ratio by implementing terminal devices that leverage the deep thermal mass within the building structure, as demonstrated in the case of Airport B. These findings suggest opportunities for further optimization of strategies for utilizing building thermal mass in energy management practices. 4.3 Limitations It is necessary to acknowledge the limitations of this work. This study focused on assessing the actual flexibility potential and influencing factors through in-field data gathered from operational large-scale centralized air-conditioning systems. However, due to considerations related to airport security and user demands, achieving variable control is not feasible. In addition, wider variable ranges could not be obtained during the investigation period, primarily due to weather conditions. As a result, the primary objective of this work is to identify potential and influencing factors. This underscores the importance of future research in providing a more precise evaluation of flexibility and demonstrating the further impacts of these factors. 5 Conclusions This study investigated the energy flexibility of centralized air-conditioning systems by field test in two hub airports. The findings revealed that the large-scale centralized air-conditioning systems in the airports possess significant energy flexibility. The main conclusions are as follows. (1) Among the centralized air-conditioning systems, the cooling plant with cooling tanks had the largest energy storage capacity (500∼1500 Whc/m2, 100\u2013200 MWhe), followed by the terminal devices with thermal mass (10\u201340 Whc/m2,15\u201320 MWhe) and the transmission & distribution network (10\u201320 Whc/m2, 1\u20135 MWhe). The peak load reduction potential of the cooling plant, terminal devices, and transmission & distribution network were 70∼110 Wc/m2 (10\u201320 MWe), 2\u201311 Wc/m2 (1\u20135 MWe), and 50\u2013120 Wc/m2 (10\u201325 MWe), respectively. (2) Terminal devices played a significant role in the energy flexibility potential of air-conditioning systems. Both Airports A and B had similar potential thermal capacities, with 2.55 × 105 J/(m2·K) and 2.69 × 105 J/(m2·K), respectively. However, the building equipped with radiant floor cooling systems and displacement ventilation (Airport B) could utilize 38.9 %\u201348.3 % of its thermal mass, compared to only 7.8 %\u201318.7 % for the all-air systems (Airport A). (3) Large-scale air-conditioning systems can actively participate in DR programs, showcasing remarkable energy flexibility and potential for long-span DR programs. By combining storage tanks, networks, and terminal devices, centralized air-conditioning systems in airports could achieve a cooling load reduction potential ranging from 2 MWe to 15 MWe, and obtain demand response time from 6 h to 20 h using different operating strategies.

        "dc:description": "Centralized air-conditioning systems are widely considered a major energy consumer with high energy flexibility, contributing to renewable penetration and power system regulation. Nevertheless, a lack of understanding of their system components' abilities limits the utilization of their full potential. Hereby, we took the centralized air-conditioning systems of two hub airports as typical examples and quantified their energy flexibility potential by cooling load reduction potential ( q max ), cooling energy storage capacity (Q), based on field test. Cooling plants had the highest potential ( q max = 70\u2013110 Wc/m2; Q = 500∼1500 Whc/m2), followed by terminal devices with building thermal mass ( q max = 2\u201311 Wc/m2; Q = 10\u201340 Whc/m2) and transmission & distribution networks ( q max = 50\u2013200 Wc/m2; Q = 10\u201320 Whc/m2). Various air-conditioning terminal devices utilize building thermal mass to different degrees. During the investigation, the conventional all-air system used 7.8 %∼18.7 % of the building's thermal capacity, whereas that of the radiant floor system significantly increased to 38.9 %∼48.3 %. Consequently, the systems of the hub airports can participate in demand response programs with a cooling load reduction of 2∼15 MWe, for 6\u201320 h using different operating strategies. These findings shed light on demand-side flexibility characterization and exploitation to support a decarbonized energy system.",
