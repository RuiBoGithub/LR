C-MEIC School of Automation Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology Nanjing 210044 China Graphical abstract Air handling units are key sub-systems of heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, which are used to condition air to satisfy human comfort requirements. Fault prognosis allows maintenance crews to identify the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of a system, thus unexpected breakdowns are avoided, leading to a decrease in maintenance costs. To estimate RULs, a Hidden Semi-Markov Model (HSMM)-based method is proposed. To estimate states of HSMMs accurately, a revised scaled method is developed to guarantee that state estimates do not approximate to infinity. Additionally, a new discrete statistical process control method is developed to filter out false state estimates of HSMMs. To estimate RULs of components and systems accurately and effectively, a backward recursive method is developed to integrate HSMMs\u2019 parameters of time-duration distributions for multiple failure modes to generate those of components and systems directly, thus low computational effort is achieved. Experimental results illustrate that the RULs of components/systems can be predicted by our method accurately in an efficient way. Keywords Air handling unit Remaining useful life Fault prognosis Statistical process control hidden-semi Markov model 1 Introduction In the U.S. commercial and residential buildings, around 57% of energy is consumed by Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems [1]. As key components of HVAC systems, Air Handling Units (AHU) are used to condition air to satisfy human comfort requirements. Faults in AHUs may cause a decrease in the cooling or heating capacity, resulting in not satisfying human comfort requirements. Failure modes are classified into two categories: sudden faults and gradual faults. Sudden faults occur unexpectedly and cannot be predicted. Unlike sudden faults, gradual faults cause gradual performance degradation of components or systems. Since the gradual fault of a component is a slow process, it can be predicted by estimating the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) which is the predicted time of a faulty component before a complete failure occurs in the component. Prognosis of components can guide maintenance crews to repair or replace failed components; the prognosis of systems shows maintenance crews a global view of system conditions. Thus, both of them are significant and are considered. To achieve the fault prognosis, the current health conditions of components are estimated first. Then, given the estimates of health conditions, RULs of components are predicted by following the dynamic evolution of health conditions. However, this is challenging since 1) measurement noise and model errors may lead to high false identification rates in estimating current health conditions; and 2) a component may have several faults and the models that capture effects of all these faults may be too complicated to use. The fault prognosis of AHUs has rarely been considered in the literature. However, fault prognosis of other systems (e.g., bearing) is investigated. As discussed in [2], these prognosis methods can be generally categorized into three main groups, including 1) knowledge-based; 2) model-based; and 3) data-driven. If physical knowledge from experts or experience is available, knowledge-based methods can be used for fault prognosis. For instance, fuzzy logic-based methods capture expert knowledge to predict the dynamics of failure in various operating conditions. Using fuzzy logic can aid in decreasing the uncertainties in the prognosis process, and that can often lead to a more accurate RUL prediction. In [3], a multiple model prognosis method is developed based on the fuzzy logic for a two-tank system. In the method, an observer generates a residual output which is proportional to the fault propagations. Additionally, signal processing techniques are known as powerful methods for fault prognosis. To predict RULs of bearings, a discrete wavelet packet transform was used [4]. In the method, signals are decomposed by discrete wavelet transform to obtain appropriate health indicators of bearings. If a proper mathematical model of degradation is available, model-based prognostic methods are effective tools. In these methods, a set of mathematical models is constructed from physical knowledge to represent degradation phenomena of components accurately, thus predictions may be more precise than those of other methods. However, developing these models requires physical knowledge and experience that may not be available. Additionally, the accumulation of prediction errors is hard to avoid since future measurements are not available to correct predictions of future states. For instance, to estimate RULs for suspension systems, a degradation model was established in [5]. In [6], first or second-order nonlinear equations were developed to model damage accumulation. Usually, filtering methods, e.g., extended Kalman filters or particle filters, were used to estimate degradation parameters for fault prognosis [7,8]. Data-driven methods are preferred when there is a lack of understanding of the dynamics of the system under consideration. Data-driven methods can be generally classified into three groups, including 1) regression-based prognosis; 2) intelligent-based prognosis; and 3) probability-based prognosis. Methods based on regression models (e.g., autoregressive models) are usually purely data-driven and can be used. For instance, a new regression-based prognosis technique is developed in [9] for the aging problem of underground cables. In the method, four features of spikes are selected from the cables. Then, the regression method is utilized in a sliding window to predict the RUL. Intelligent-based prognosis methods including Neural Networks (NN), decision trees, etc., have been widely considered for the fault prognosis task. NNs usually construct a network with multiple layers consisting of partially or fully connected nodes. The network can approximate an arbitrary nonlinear function, thus they are effective tools for modeling and accurately representing complex nonlinear dynamic evolution of systems when accurate mathematical models are not available. However, NNs may capture various sources of uncertainty like process noise or measurement noise during the training phase, thus the uncertainty would create a significant error over a long-term prediction. Additionally, NNs do not consider physical knowledge and thus lack transparency and robustness. Various NNs, e.g., recurrent NNs [10], multiscale convolutional neural network [11], and neuro-fuzzy networks [12] were employed for fault prognosis. For instance, a Multiscale Convolutional Neural Network (MSCNN) is proposed to predict RULs of bearings [13]. Since the MSCNN keeps the global and local information synchronously in features, it performs better than traditional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and different CNN-based methods. In [14], a Deep Belief Network (DBN) Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) algorithm is developed to predict the RULs of rotating components. This algorithm takes advantage of self-taught feature learning capability of the DBN and the predicting power of the FNN, thus it allows automatic feature extraction and RUL prediction without human intervention. As an intelligent method, the decision tree has also been used to estimate RULs of systems [15]. For instance, a Categorical Boosting (CatBoost) algorithm improved basesd on the gradient boosting decision tree is introduced to estimate RULs of aircraft engines [16]. The estimation accuracy is improved due to the superior prediction ablity and generalization performance. Probability theory can serve as an excellent and appropriate way to predict the RULs of systems. In probabilistic-based prognosis methods, state-space models (e.g., a Markov model) are obtained by using a Markov method. Then, a Bayesian inference method is implemented to obtain the posterior Probability Density Function (PDF) of the state for estimating RULs of systems [17\u201320]. For instance, in [17], a method predicting the RUL of a drop system is proposed based on the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the Bayesian inference method. In [18], an adaptive Bayesian algorithm is applied to estimate RULs according to different features. An ordered weighted averaging operator is then used to fuse these estimates of RULs to improve accuracy. Different from existing works, impacts of varying operating conditions on the failure dynamic severities are considered in the fault prognosis of wind turbine drivetrain bearings [19]. In [20], failure parameters are estimated using distributed NNs. Given estimates of these parameters, the RUL is predicted using a recursive Bayesian algorithm. As a Makov model, Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is applied to estimate RULs of devices such as bearings [21]. Compared to knowledge-based methods and model-based methods, HMM-based methods are developed based on statistical models rather than deep knowledge of systems or accurate mathematical models, thus are easier to implement. Compared to intelligent-based methods, HMM-based methods make explicit relationships between hidden states and actual health conditions of the system, thus may describe the dynamic evolving of states more accurately. However, the residence time of an HMM is implicitly geometric distributed, but this is not reasonable sometimes. For instance, in [22], both shock damage and performance degradation are considered to estimate the system\u2019s RUL. The duration of time among shock damages was assumed to be exponentially, and the degradation time was assumed to follow a normal distribution. Unlike HMMs, Hidden Semi-Markov Model (HSMM) has extra parameters to represent distributions of time-durations explicitly, thus can describe evolutions of states more accurately than HMMs. For instance, in [23], RULs of pumps were estimated using HSMMs. Based on an analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of existing fault prognosis methods, an HSMM-based method is proposed to predict RULs of an AHU and its components. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the structure of a typical AHU and its faults considered are introduced. In Section 3, an HSMM-based approach is developed to estimate RULs of components with a single fault. In the approach, the HSMM of a fault is established, and a revised scaled method is developed to estimate states of the HSMM while achieving low false identification rates. Additionally, a discrete Statistical Process Control (SPC) method is developed to filter out false estimates of HSMMs\u2019 states, in order to improve the fault prognosis accuracy. In Section 4, the HSMM-based approach developed in Section 3 is extended to the multiple faults case. To integrate the impacts of multiple faults, a statistical method is proposed to integrate HSMM parameters of multiple faults to generate those of components and systems instead of estimating them directly, resulting in low computational requirements. In Section 5, our fault prognosis method is tested using data from a small simulated building. Experimental results show that our method performs well in predicting RULs of the AHU and its components. Compared to the existing works in the literature, the proposed method has the following novelties and contributions: \u2022 A scaled Viterbi algorithm is improved to avoid the failure of estimating states of HSMMs. \u2022 A new discrete SPC method is proposed based on characteristics of HSMMs to filter out their false state estimates, leading to a low false identification rate, e.g., the average F-measures of different failure modes is around 0.926. \u2022 To reduce computational requirements to estimate the RUL in time, a statistical method is developed to integrate parameters of HSMMs of failure modes to obtain those of HSMMs of components directly, and the time required to estimate the RULs is reduced by 77.8%. 2 The AHU system and its faults considered AHUs are used to condition air to satisfy human comfort requirements and improve air quality. As shown in Fig. 1 , an AHU system usually consists of multiple components including 1) the outdoor/recirculation/exhaust air damper; 2) the heating/cooling coil; 3) the filter; and 4) the supply/return air fan. In the mixing box, outdoor air is mixed with the return air from rooms by adjusting the outdoor air damper and the return air damper. Then, the mixed air passes through the filter, the heating coil, and the cooling coil. The controller looks at the difference between the actual zone temperature and the desired temperature to ascertain if heating or cooling is required and then sends appropriate signals to the cooling coil or the heating coil. The typical operating sequence for AHUs consists of four primary modes during occupied periods for maintaining the supply air temperature and the ventilation at preset levels. The four primary modes including 1) the heating mode; 2) the cooling mode with outside air; 3) mechanical cooling modes are determined by modulating the heating coil valve, the mixing box dampers, and the cooling valve. The conditioned air is delivered to VAV boxes by the supply air fan. As discussed before, sudden faults occur suddenly and cannot be predicted. Thus, only three gradual faults in AHUs are considered in this article and are summarized in Table 1 . In the table, the subscript \u2018cc\u2019 means the cooling coil; and the subscript \u2018sf\u2019 means the supply fan. In the three faults, tube fouling in cooling coils is denoted by ftube,cc , and this fault could cause a gradual decrease in the tube inside diameter dtube,in . The chilled water flow rate decreases, leading to a decrease in heat transfer efficiency. The parameter dtube,in can reflect the impacts of this fault, thus is considered as a fault-related parameter. Similarly, dust on fins of cooling coils ffin,cc causes a decrease in the fin outside surface area Afin , resulting in a decrease in heat transfer efficiency. Afin is also considered as a fault-related parameter. For the supply fan, a decrease in supply fan efficiency esf could cause more power consumption, and esf is considered as a fault-related parameter. As shown in Table 1, to detect the fault ftube,cc , several measurements are required in our method, including 1) the mixed air temperature Ta,mix ; 2) the humidity ratio of mixed air Wa,mix ; 3) the supply air temperature Ta,sup ; 4) the humidity ratio of supply air Wa,sup ; 5) the supply air mass flow rate m ̇ a , sup ; 6) the supply chilled water temperature Tchw,sup ; 7) the return chilled water temperature Tchw,rn ; and 8) the chilled water flow rate m ̇ chw . Similarly, these measurements are also required to detect the fault ffin,cc . To detect the fault feff,sf , the fan power Qsf and the supply air mass flow rate m ̇ a , sup are required. In this paper, all of these measurements are assumed to be available. However, the supply air mass flow rate m ̇ a , sup and the chilled water flow rate m ̇ chw may not be available in real systems. In the future, we will find a method to calculate these two measurements based on other available measurements, or improve our method to detect the faults without using m ̇ a , sup and m ̇ chw . Since the heating coil is similar to the cooling coil, and the supply fan is similar to the return fan, the three gradual faults of a cooling coil and a supply fan are considered as examples in this article. 3 Estimating RULs of AHU components with single fault In subsection 3.1, components with a single fault are considered. HSMMs of failure modes are established to describe dynamic evolving of fault severities. In subsection 3.2, a scaled Viterbi algorithm developed for HSMMs is improved to estimate states with low false identification rates. In subsection 3.3, a discrete SPC method is developed to filter out false estimates of HSMM\u2019s states. In subsection 3.4, a backward recursive method is improved to estimate RULs of components with a single fault. 3.1 HSMMs of failure modes To estimate the current state (i.e., normal condition or fault severities) and its evolution of a component with a single fault, the supply fan is used as an example since only one gradual fault of this component is considered as shown in Table 1. Health conditions of the supply fan depend on severities of the gradual fault, i.e., the decrease in fan efficiency. Thus, an HSMM of the gradual fault is established to capture transitions among different severities to describe the dynamic evolution of the supply fan\u2019s health conditions. Parameters of the HSMM are estimated by using Gibbs sampling. An HSMM Capturing Transitions among Fault Severities. In the case that a component only has one failure mode, fault severities are considered as states of the HSMM. Usually, a gradual fault has three phases, including 1) incipient; 2) medium-term; and 3) late-in-life. Thus, the fault is assumed to have three severities, and the supply fan has four states Ssf = 0, 1, 2, and 3. These states represent the normal condition and three fault severities. HSMM is a statistical model with the same structure as an HMM except that the state evolving is semi-Markov rather than Markov. This means that the probability of there being a change in the hidden state depends on the amount of time that has elapsed since the entry into the current state. Therefore, an HSMM of the supply fan is established as shown in Fig. 2 . An HSMM contains four kinds of parameters, including 1) the initial probability vector π = { πi }, i = 1,\u2026, N, where N is the number of states, which determines the probability of belonging to each state at the initial time; 2) the state transition matrix P = {aij }, i,j = 1,\u2026, N, that represents state transition probabilities; 3) observation likelihoods bi (O(t)), i = 1,\u2026, N; t = 1,\u2026, K, where K is the length of the state sequence and O(t) is the observation at time t; and 4) parameters of time-duration distributions determining the amount of time that has elapsed since the entry into each state. Unlike HMMs, an HSMM represents transitions among state segments rather than states. In each segment, states are the same. In HSMMs, self-transitions are forbidden, and thus the state transition matrix P = {aij } consists of (1) a ij = Pr s ( t + 1 ) = j | s ( t ) = i i ≠ j 0 i = j . To find observations for HSMMs, three types of variables are selected, including 1) sensor readings reflecting fault impacts; 2) residuals between certain sensor readings and their set-points; and 3) differences between the predicted values of certain sensor readings and their measured values [24]. As justified in [24], the fault indicator matrix of the supply fan is established as: (2) X sf = m ̇ a , sup ( 1 ) Δ T sf ( 1 ) R phy , s f ( 1 ) . . . m ̇ a , sup ( K ) Δ T sf ( K ) R phy , s f ( K ) . where K is the length of the observation sequence; m ̇ a , sup is the supply air mass flow rate; ΔTsf is the rise of the air temperature through the supply fan; Rphy,sf is the residual between the left-side and the right side of the fan model [25]. These variables may be correlated and contain redundant information. To remove redundancy, principal component analysis is used to project this fault indicator matrix into a reduced space. If m vectors represent more than 95% correlated information, they are regarded as \u201cprincipal components\u201d to reflect original spaces and considered as observations of the HSMM. For Xsf , the first component captures 98.052% of the variation in data and is used as the observation Osf . Gibbs Sampler to Estimate Parameters of the HSMM. As justified in [26], Gibbs sampling is selected to estimate parameters of the HSMM for the supply fan. In a Gibbs sampler, prior distributions of parameters are assumed based on their characteristics first, and then the maximum a posteriori estimating is utilized to derive posterior distributions based on prior distributions. To update a certain parameter, other parameters are fixed. Samples of this parameter are generated randomly based on their posterior distributions [26]. For instance, for the HSMM of the supply fan, in kth iteration, initial probability vectors, observation likelihoods, and time-duration distribution parameters are fixed. The posterior distribution of each row of the state transition matrix Psf = {aij,sf } follows a Dirichlet distribution as, (3) ( a i 1 , s f , \u2026 , a iN , s f ) D ̃ i r ( n i 1 , s f + β 1 , \u2026 , n iN , s f + β N ) , i = 1 , \u2026 , N where nij,sf is the number of transitions from State i to State j in the state sequence. Parameters β 1, \u2026, βN are usually set as 1 [26]. Values of aij,sf are generated randomly from the Dirichlet distribution by following (3). 3.2 An improved scaled Viterbi algorithm to estimate states of HSMMs To estimate states of the supply fan\u2019s HSMM with an observation sequence Osf (1:K) = Osf (1)Osf (2)\u2026Osf (K), the Viterbi algorithm is usually used [27]. In this algorithm, there is a forward process and a backward process. In the forward process, at time t, the maximum value of the probability that observations of the supply fan from time t-d + 1 to time t correspond to State i is calculated as, (4) δ i , s f ( t ) = max d δ i , s f ∗ ( t - d ) p i , s f ( d ) ∏ s = t - d + 1 t b i ( O sf ( s ) ) , where d = 1, \u2026, Mi is the time-duration and Mi is the upper bound of the time-duration for State i ; pi,sf (d) is the probability that the length of a segment for State i is d; bi (Osf (s)) is the probability of observation Osf from State i at time s; and δ j , s f ∗ is the maximum value of probabilities that state sequences stay in State i at time t and transit to State j at time t + 1, (5) δ j , s f ∗ ( t ) = max i δ i , s f ( t ) a ij , s f , where aij,sf is the probability that the supply fan transits from State i to State j. The time-duration d maximizing the probability δ i , s f ∗ ( t - d ) p i , s f ( d ) ∏ s = t - d + 1 t b i ( O sf ( s ) ) as shown in (4) is recorded, and the State i maximizing δ i , s f ( t ) a ij , s f as shown in (5) is also recorded. In the backward process, δi,sf (K) is determined first. Then, given recorded time-duration d and State i, the best sequence of states is recovered by back-tracking. As shown in (4), the probability δi,sf (t) becomes small as t increases, to the extent that they become too small to be represented within a computer. This could cause failed estimating. This problem can be addressed by using one set of scaling parameters ksf (t) to scale δi,sf (t) [27]. Let δ ̂ i , s f ( t ) , the scaled version of δi,sf (t) , be ∑ i = 1 N δ ̂ i , s f ( t ) = 1 and suppose (6) δ ̂ i , s f ( t ) = ∏ τ = - ∞ t k sf ( τ ) δ i , s f ( t ) . By summing both sides of (6) with respect to i, it gives (7) ∑ i = 1 N sf δ ̂ i , s f ( t ) = ∑ i = 1 N sf ∏ τ = - ∞ t k sf ( τ ) δ i , s f ( t ) , where Nsf is the number of supply fan\u2019 states. Considering that ∑ i = 1 N δ ̂ i , s f ( t ) = 1 , it gives (8) ∏ τ = - ∞ t k sf ( τ ) = 1 / ∑ i = 1 N sf δ i , s f ( t ) . Given (8), the initial value of ksf (τ) can be calculated as: (9) k sf ( 0 ) = 1 / ∑ i = 1 N sf δ i , s f ( 0 ) = 1 / ∑ i = 1 N sf π i , s f = 1 . where πi,sf is the initial probability corresponding to State i of the supply fan. Similarly, the scaled version of bi (Osf (t)) is, (10) b ̂ i O sf ( t ) = k sf ( t ) b i O sf ( t ) , where bi (Osf (t)) is the probability of observation Osf from State i at time t, and b ̂ i O sf ( t ) is the scaled version of bi (Osf (t)). As discussed before, δi,sf (t) may become too small to be represented within a computer, thus the scaling parameters ksf (t) cannot be calculated based on δi,sf (t) by following (8). To address this issue, a method is developed. In this method, the probability δ ̂ i , s f ( t ) is calculated as (11) δ ̂ i , s f ( t ) = ∑ d = 1 t δ ̂ i , s f ∗ ( t - d ) p i , s f ( d ) ∏ s = t - d + 1 t b ̂ i O sf ( s ) . = ∑ d = 1 t δ ̂ i , s f ∗ ( t - d ) p i , s f ( d ) k sf ( t ) b i O sf ( t ) ∏ s = t - d + 1 t - 1 b ̂ i O sf ( s ) . It can be found that, ksf (t) is required to calculate δ ̂ i , s f ( t ) . Let (12) δ i , s f ⌣ ( t ) = ∑ d = 1 t δ i , s f ∗ ( t - d ) p i , s f ( d ) b i O sf ( t ) ∏ s = t - d + 1 t - 1 b ̂ i O sf ( s ) , where pi,sf (d) is the probability that the length of a segment from State i is d. Unlike δ ̂ i , s f ( t ) , δ i , s f ⌣ ( t ) only needs bi (Osf (t)) at time t instead of b ̂ i O sf ( t ) = k sf ( t ) b i O sf ( t ) . Therefore, δ i , s f ⌣ ( t ) can be calculated without ksf (t). By comparing (12) with (11), it gives (13) δ ̂ i , s f ( t ) = k sf ( t ) δ i , s f ⌣ ( t ) . By summing both sides of (13) with respect to i, it gives (14) ∑ i = 1 N δ ̂ i , s f ( t ) = k sf ( t ) ∑ i = 1 N δ i , s f ⌣ ( t ) . Considering that ∑ i = 1 N δ ̂ i , s f ( t ) = 1 , k(t) is calculated as (15) k sf ( t ) = 1 / ∑ i = 1 N δ i , s f ⌣ ( t ) . Thus, in the method, δ i , s f ⌣ ( t ) is calculated first, and then ksf (t) is calculated based on δ i , s f ⌣ ( t ) . However, sometimes, because of measurement noise, the observation may be far from the means of probability distributions corresponding to all states. Therefore, bi (Osf (t)), i = 1,\u2026, Nsf may approximate to 0. Thus, δ i , s f ⌣ ( t ) , i = 1,\u2026, Nsf also approximate to 0, which means that k sf ( t ) = 1 / ∑ i = 1 N δ i , s f ⌣ ( t ) approximates to ∞. This ksf (t) is too large to be represented within a computer, and is denoted, for example, as \u201cInf\u201d in Matlab. Thus, the product of δ i , s f ⌣ ( t ) and ksf (t) is still \u201cInf.\u201d In this case, by following (11), δ ̂ i , s f ( t ) i = 1,\u2026, Nsf approximates to ∞. Therefore, State i maximizing δ ̂ i , s f ( t ) cannot be determined. Consequently, the state estimate at time t cannot be obtained. To address this issue, an improved scaled algorithm is proposed. In this algorithm, if ksf (t) approximates to ∞, it is set as 1. Thus, δ ̂ i , s f ( t ) = δ i , s f ⌣ ( t ) ; otherwise, k(t) is calculated by following (15), and other variables are scaled based on ksf (t). The procedure of this algorithm is shown in Table 2 . 3.3 A discrete SPC method proposed to filter out false estimates of HSMMs\u2019 states Because of model errors or measurement noise, estimates of HSMM states may deviate from their current state even though no state transition occurs, leading to false state estimates. To filter out these false estimates, SPC methods are usually used [28]. In these methods, control charts are developed to monitor the dynamic evolution of states. However, most of the existing SPC methods were developed for continuous states but not discrete ones, thus is not suitable to HSMMs considering that states of HSMMs are discrete [28]. Therefore, a discrete SPC method is developed to filter out false estimates of HSMMs. In the SPC method, to represent the dynamic characteristics of state evolving, the moving window consisting of recent state estimates is utilized to describe the current state evolving. If many state estimates deviate from their current state, it is reasonable to judge that a state transition occurs. Based on this concept, the supply fan is used as an example to illustrate our SPC method. The current moving window Wi,sf corresponds to State i, and its length is Lsf . In the moving window, assuming that Ni,sf estimates deviate from State i, then the ratio of Ni,sf to Lsf is considered as the statistic of the SPC method since it can reflect the possibility of a state transition, and the ratio is denoted by Xi,sf . The control limits of Xi,sf are denoted by [LCLi,sf , UCLi,sf ]. If Xi,sf is in the control limits, it is reasonable to judge that there is no state transition; otherwise, it makes sense to judge that a state transition occurs. The proposed SPC method consists of two phases: the training phase and the testing phase. In the training phase, control limits [LCLi,sf , UCLi,sf ] for each state are obtained based on training data. In the testing phase, the statistic Xi,sf is compared to [LCLi,sf , UCLi,sf ] to determine whether a state transition occurs or not. The proposed SPC method is presented below in detail. In the training phase, to obtain control limits [LCLi,sf , UCLi,sf ] corresponding to State i of the supply fan, the statistic Ni,sf representing the number of estimates deviating from the current state i is assumed to follow a binomial distribution as: (16) P { N i , s f = n i } = L sf n i p i , s f n i ( 1 - p i , s f ) L sf - n i , n i = 0 , 1 , . . . , L sf where ni is the number of estimates deviating from State i in the current moving window; and pi,sf is the probability that estimates corresponding to State i of the supply fan are falsely estimated as other states. Since the actual value of the current state is required but is not available, the previous state estimate is considered as the actual current state. To obtain pi,sf , state estimates s ̂ sf ( 1 : K train ) of training data are obtained by using the Viterbi algorithm, where Ktrain is the length of the sequence of the training data. To extract moving windows from s ̂ sf ( 1 : K train ) , it is important to determine an appropriate Lsf . If Lsf is small, the state transition could be judged if only one estimate deviates from its current state, leading to many false estimates. To address this issue, Lsf is set to be large enough to ensure that the probability γ of detecting at least one state deviation in a moving window is large enough. Since the Lsf should be large enough for all states, L sf = max i L i , s f . Based on (16), the relationship between Li,sf and the probability γ is described as: (17) P { n i , s f ⩾ 1 } = 1 - P { n i , s f = 0 } = 1 - L i , s f 0 p i , s f 0 ( 1 - p i , s f ) L i , s f ⩾ γ . Since L sf = max i L i , s f , Lsf is obtained as (18) L sf = max i L i , s f = max i ln 1 - γ ln ( 1 - p i , s f ) After selecting an appropriate Lsf , Ktrain -Lsf + 1 moving windows Wk,sf , where k = Lsf , Lsf + 1,\u2026, Ktrain are extracted from s ̂ sf ( 1 : K train ) , where the moving window Wk,sf contains estimates from time k-Lsf + 1 to time k. The set of moving windows corresponding to State i is denoted by WSi,sf . In each moving window W k , s f , k ∈ W S i , s f , the number n k , k ∈ W S i , s f of estimates deviating from State i in the moving window at time k is counted. The probability X ¯ i , s f that estimates deviate from State i is the average value of Xi,sf , thus is considered as the estimate of Xi,sf . It is calculated as, (19) X ¯ i , s f = ∑ k ∈ W S i , s f n k L · ∑ k = L sf K train δ k ( i ) , k = L sf , L sf + 1 , . . . , K train with (20) δ k ( i ) = 1 , k ∈ W S i , s f 0 , o t h e r w i s e , where δ k ( i ) is the Kronecker delta function. Based on the characteristics of the statistic Xi,sf , P-chart is suitable to monitor the dynamic evolution of Xi,sf . Therefore, given X ¯ i , s f calculated in (19), LCLi,sf and UCLi,sf are calculated as, (21) LC L i , s f = X ¯ i , s f - 3 X ¯ i , s f ( 1 - X ¯ i , s f ) L sf , i = 1 , 2 , . . . , N sf (22) UC L i , s f = X ¯ i , s f + 3 X ¯ i , s f ( 1 - X ¯ i , s f ) L sf , i = 1 , 2 , . . . , N sf In the testing phase, as discussed before, state estimates may deviate from their current state because of 1) state transition; or 2) model errors or measurement noise. If the current moving window Wk,sf corresponds to State i and a state estimate starts to deviate from State i at time k, the deviation time k is recorded. The statistic Xi,sf will increase as the number of estimates deviating from State i in Wk,sf is keep growing. If Xi,sf is larger than UCLi,sf at time k + l 1, it is reasonable to determine that a transition from State i occurs. However, if Xi,sf starts to decrease at time k + l 2 and it is still smaller than UCLi,sf , it is reasonable to judge that a transition from State i does not occurs. Therefore, the estimates deviating from State i between k and k + l 2 are considered as false estimates and are replaced by State i to improve the estimating accuracy. 3.4 A backward recursive method for estimating RULs of a component with a single fault Because of a fault, the capacity of the supply fan decreases, even to the point that the comfort requirements are not satisfied. The RUL refers to the available service time left before the capacity degradation reaches an unacceptable level. It is assumed that the component does not work if its fault severity is 3. Thus, the time to Severity 3 is regarded as the RUL. To estimate RULs, current fault severity, probabilities of transitions among different severities, and time-durations for each severity are required. The current fault severity is the HSMM state and others are parameters of HSMMs, and they are estimated based on HSMMs established in subsection 3.1. Given the estimated states and parameters, a backward recursive method was used to estimate RULs [29]. For instance, as shown in Fig. 3 , the supply fan\u2019s fault can transit from State 0 to State 1, 2, or 3. The procedure of the method is shown as follows: (23) In S t a t e 3 : R U L 3 , s f = 0 , (24) In S t a t e 2 : R U L 2 , s f = a 22 , s f · ( D 2 , s f - - t s 2 , s f ) , (25) In S t a t e 1 : R U L 1 , s f = a 11 , s f · ( D 1 , s f - t s 1 , s f + R U L 2 , s f ) + a 12 , s f · R U L 2 , s f , (26) In S t a t e 0 : R U L 0 , s f = a 00 , s f ( D 0 , s f - t s 0 , s f + R U L 1 , s f ) + a 01 , s f R U L 1 , s f + a 02 , s f R U L 2 , s f , where RULi,sf is the supply fan\u2019s RUL in State i; the variable tsi,sf is the current time-duration in State i; aij,sf is the probability of transiting from State i to State j; and Di,sf is the time-duration in State i of the supply fan. As shown in (25), the state of the supply fan has two possible evolutions if it is in State 1. In the first case, the supply fan retains its current State 1 with probability a 11 ,sf , and the expected RUL is D1,sf - ts1,sf + RUL2,sf as shown in (25). In the second case, the supply fan may transit to State 2 with the probability a 12 ,sf , and the expected RUL is RUL 2 ,sf . The weighted average of RULs in the two cases is considered as the RUL in State 1. Similarly, if the supply fan is in State 0, it may retain its current State 0, transit to State 1, or transit to State 2 as shown in (26). 4 Estimating RULs of an AHU or its components with multiple faults In this subsection, components/systems with multiple faults are considered. To capture the effects of multiple faults, a statistical method is improved to integrate HSMMs of failure modes by extracting \u201cmapping matrices\u201d from physics-based models. In subsection 4.1, a statistical method is used to obtain mapping matrices to represent relationships between a component and its faults. In subsection 4.2, parameters of HSMMs of failure modes are integrated to generate those of components and the AHU. Then, the method in subsection 3.4 is extended to estimate RULs of the component/system with multiple failure modes. 4.1 Derivations of mapping matrices In a cooling coil, levels of capacity are discrete forms of the cooling capacity. Fault severities are discrete forms of fault-related parameters, e.g., the fin surface area Afin , which reflect fault severities. Additionally, a physics-based model of cooling coils represents relationships between the fault-related parameters and the cooling capacity [30]. Thus, it is reasonable to discretize the physics-based model to obtain mapping matrices representing the discrete relationships between levels of capacity (states of the HSMM of the cooling coil) and fault severities (states of HSMMs of failure modes) as shown in Fig. 4 [29]. To achieve this goal, Monte-Carlo simulation is used. For instance, as mentioned in Section 2, two faults 1) tube fouling ftube,cc ; and 2) dust on fins ffin,cc of cooling coils are considered. The tube inside diameter dtube,in and the fin surface area Afin reflect effects of ftube,cc and ffin,cc , thus are considered as fault-related parameters. Nsmp sets of (dtube,in , Afin ) are randomly sampled from ranges corresponding to different fault severities with equal probabilities. These samples are then substituted into the physics-based model of cooling coils to calculate corresponding cooling capacities. To represent multiple failure modes as an entity, the joint state of the cooling coil is denoted by sjs ,cc. Since each gradual fault has four states, there are Njs,cc = 42 = 16 joint states, e.g., sjs,cc = 0 corresponds to (stube,cc = 0, sfin,cc = 0), where stube,cc is the state of ftube,cc and stube,cc is the state of ffin,cc , respectively. Additionally, the state of the cooling coil is denoted by scc , where scc = 0 is the normal condition, and scc = 1, 2, and 3 are the three fault severities. Since states of failure modes of a cooling coil determine the state of the cooling coil, scc and sjs,cc are correlated, and each state of scc may correspond to several states of sjs,cc . The amount of points belonging to both scc = i and sjs,cc = j is denoted by lij,cc , and that of scc = i is denoted by li,cc . A mapping matrix Q cc = {qij,cc }, where qij,cc = Pr(sjs,cc = j | scc = i), representing the probability of each joint state given each state of the cooling coil is obtained as: (27) Pr ( s js , c c = j | s cc = i ) = l ij , c c / l i , c c . Similarly, a mapping matrix R cc = {rij,cc }, where rij,cc = Pr(scc = j |sjs,cc = i), is also derived to represent the probability of each cooling coil\u2019s state given each joint state. 4.2 Integration of parameters of HSMMs of failure modes Based on Qcc and Rcc obtained in subsection 4.1, HSMM parameters of the cooling coil can be obtained by integrating HSMM parameters of failure modes as below. Integration of State Transition Matrices. The state transition matrix P js , c c , H S M M = P tube ⊗ P fin of joint states is the Kronecker product of those of the two failure modes ftube,cc and ffin,cc , where Ptube and Pfin are state transition matrices of ftube,cc and ffin,cc , respectively. To convert the state transition matrix of joint states into that of the cooling coil, the mapping matrix Qcc is used [29]. Since self-transitions of HSMMs are forbidden, the forbidden characteristic is difficult to be captured in the conversion equations for HSMMs. However, for HMMs, it is not necessary to capture the forbidden characteristic, thus the conversion equations are easy to derive. Additionally, it is easy to convert HMMs into their corresponding HSMMs. Therefore, converting the state transition matrix of joint states into that of the cooling coil includes three steps: 1) converting the HSMM\u2019s state transition matrix Pjs,cc,HSMM of joint states into its corresponding HMM\u2019s state transition matrix Pjs,cc,HMM ; 2) generating the state transition matrix Pcc,HMM of the HMM for the cooling coil based on Pjs,cc,HMM and the mapping matrix Qcc ; and 3) converting Pcc,HMM into the state transition matrix Pcc,HSMM of the HSMM for the cooling coil. To obtain Pjs,cc,HMM , the estimated sequence s ̂ js , c c ( t ) , t = 1 , \u2026 , K of joint states is obtained by integrating the estimated state sequences s ̂ tube , c c ( t ) , t = 1 , \u2026 , K and s ̂ fin , c c ( t ) , t = 1 , \u2026 , K of the two failure modes. Given s ̂ js , c c ( t ) , t = 1 , \u2026 , K , the visitor matrix {mij,js,cc } is obtained by counting the numbers of visitors in the sequence. Then, the Pjs,cc,HMM is generated based on {mij,js,cc } by following (3). The Pcc,HMM of the cooling coil is derived based on Pjs,cc,HMM , Q cc and R cc as P cc , H M M s cc ( t + 1 ) = j | s cc ( t ) = i (28) = ∑ n ∑ m P s cc ( t + 1 ) = j | s js , c c ( t + 1 ) = n · P s js , c c ( t ) = m | s cc ( t ) = i · P s js , c c ( t + 1 ) = n | s js , c c ( t ) = m where Pr(sjs,cc (t + 1) = n | sjs,cc (t) = m) is obtained from Pjs,cc, HMM ; Pr(scc (t + 1) = j | sjs,cc (t + 1) = n) is obtained from Rcc [29]; and Pr(sjs,cc (t) = m | scc (t) = i) is obtained from Qcc . The matrix of visitors of the HMM and that of the HSMM are denoted by {mij,cc } and {mij,cc }, respectively. Given Pcc,HMM , {mij,cc } is generated. Since self-transition is forbidden in HSMMs, the visitor matrix {nij,cc } of the HSMM is converted into the visitor matrix {mij,cc } of the HMM by setting diagonal elements of {nij,cc } as 0, i.e., (29) n ij , c c = m ij , c c , i ≠ j 0 , i = j . As shown in (3), the state transition matrix of the HSMM Pcc,HSMM = {aij,cc } can be obtained based on {nij,cc }. Similarly, this method can be extended to the AHU based on its physics-based model. Integration of Parameters of Time-Duration Distributions. In [29], to estimate parameters of time-duration distributions of the cooling coil, the state sequence of the cooling coil is generated based on the state transition matrix Pcc,HSMM directly, and then the least square method is used to estimate the parameters based on the generated state sequence. In this process, the impacts of multiple failure modes are not reflected accurately. To address this issue, a statistical method is developed. In this method, time-duration parameters of joint states are obtained first and then are converted into those of the cooling coil. To obtain time-duration parameters of joint states, Monte Carlo simulation is applied. By using this method, Nsmp state sequences of failure modes ftube,cc and ffin,cc are generated, respectively. By combining them, Nsmp state sequences of joint states are obtained. Time-durations of each joint state i in these state sequences are counted and are used to estimate the Poisson distribution parameter λi,js,cc by using the least square method. Given λi,js,cc , the expected time-duration of each joint state Dj,js , j = 1, \u2026, Njs , is obtained, where Njs is the number of joint states. To convert the time-duration parameters of joint states into those of the cooling coil, the property of the joint state\u2019s dynamic evolving is considered. Joint states represent severities of failure modes and always become severe since repair is not regarded. Thus, the dynamic evolution of joint states possesses the left-to-right property, namely, the sum of digits of joint states could only increases or stays the same. For instance, considering that the cooling coil has 16 joint states, the dynamic evolution of joint states with the left-to-right property is shown in Fig. 5 . In this figure, the joint state sjs = \u201801\u2019 means that ftube,cc does not happen and the fault severity of ffin,cc is 1. Sum of the digits of the two-digit number \u201801\u2019 is 1. Similarly, sjs = \u201802\u2019 means that ftube,cc does not happen and the fault severity of ffin,cc is 2, and the sum of the digits of the two-digit number is 2. The larger the sum of the digits is, the severer the fault is. Since the failure will only get worse, the joint state could transit from \u201801\u2019 to \u201802\u2019 but not the other way around. Since states of failure modes of a cooling coil determine the state of the cooling coil, each state of a cooling coil corresponds to multiple joint states which are combinations of states of failure modes. Thus, it is reasonable to consider the evolving time from the joint state with the minimum sum of the digits to that with the maximum one as the expected time duration of the state. For instance, the cooling coil may be in State 3 when states of the two failure modes are {stube,cc , sfin,cc } = {2, 1}, {stube,cc , sfin,cc } = {2, 2}, {stube,cc , sfin,cc } = {3, 1}, or {stube,cc , sfin,cc } = {3, 2}. In other words, the cooling coil state scc = 3 corresponds to joint states sjs,cc = {\u201821,\u2019 \u201822,\u2019 \u201831,\u2019 \u201832\u2019}. \u201821\u2019 has the minimum sum of digits which is 3 and \u201832\u2032 has the maximum one which is 5. The evolving time from sjs,cc = \u201821\u2019 to sjs,cc = \u201832\u2019 can be considered as the expected time-duration of scc = 3. Based on this concept, to estimate the expected time-duration of State k of the cooling coil, we can find joint states related to State k given the mapping matrix Rcc . The set of joint states in which the sum of digits is d is denoted by S d k , c c . The minimum sum of digits and the maximum sum of digits for State k are denoted by dmin,k and dmax,k , respectively. Calculating the expected time-duration of State k is equivalent to calculating the expected time-duration from the joint state i ∈ S d k , c c = d min , k to the joint state j ∈ S d k , c c = d max , k . In this process, to calculate the time duration from a joint state i ∈ S d k , c c = d max , k - 2 to a joint state j ∈ S d k , c c = d max , k , the time duration from a joint state m ∈ S d k , c c = d max , k - 1 to a joint state j ∈ S d k , c c = d max , k is required. Thus, a backward recursive method is developed to calculate the time-duration of State k as below. In joint state j which sum of digits is dmax,k : (30) D j , c c k = D j , j s , j ∈ S d k , c c = d max , k , In joint state j which sum of digits is dmax,k −1: (31) D j , c c k = D j , j s + ∑ i ∈ S d k , c c = d max , k a ji D i , c c k , j ∈ S d k , c c = d max , k - 1 , In joint state j which digit sum is dmin,k : (32) D j , c c k = D j , j s + ∑ i ∈ s d k , c c = d min , k + 1 a j , i D i , c c k , j ∈ s d k , c c = d min , k , where Dj,js is the time-duration of joint state j; D j , c c k is the time-duration from joint state j to joint state i ∈ s d k , c c = d max , k , and the joint state j belongs to State k of the cooling coil. As shown in (30), if sum of digits of the joint state j is dmax,k , the end of the joint state j is also the end of State k. Therefore, the expected time-duration of the joint state j is equivalent to the expected time-duration from the current time to the end of State k. As shown in (31), if the sum of digits of the joint state j is dmax,k -1, the joint state j could transit to the joint state i which sum of digits is dmax,k , and the state transition probabilities aji is obtained from the state transition matrix Pjs,cc,HSMM calculated before. Thus, the expected time duration from the current time to the end of State k is the sum of the expected time duration of the joint state j, and the weighted sum of the expected time duration from all possible joint states i to the end of State k. Similarly, as shown in (32), the expected time-duration of State k is the sum of the expected time-duration of the joint state j, and the weighted sum of the expected time-duration from all possible joint states i to the end of State k. The number of joint states in which the sum of digits is dmin,k is denoted by nmin,k . If nmin,k = 1, the expected time duration of State k is D k , c c = D j ∈ s d k , c c = d min , k , c c k . If nmin,k is larger than 1 which means that multiple joint states could be the end of State k, it is reasonable to calculate the average value of expected time-durations for these joint states D k , c c = ∑ j = 1 n min , k D j , c c k / n min , k as the expected time-duration of State k. For instance, the cooling coil state scc = 3 corresponds to joint states sjs,cc = {\u201921,\u2019 \u201922,\u2019 \u201931,\u2019 \u201932\u2032}={9, 10, 13, 14}, where dmin,3 = 3 and dmax,3 = 5. Then,In joint state 14 which digit sum is 5: (33) D 14 , c c 3 = D 14 , j s , In joint state 10 which digit sum is 4: (34) D 10 , c c 3 = D 10 , j s + a 10 , 14 · D 14 , c c 3 , In joint state 13 which digit sum is also 4: (35) D 13 , c c 3 = D 13 , j s + a 13 , 14 · D 14 , c c 3 , In joint state 9 which digit sum is 3: (36) D 3 , c c = D 9 , j s + a 9 , 10 · D 10 , c c 3 + a 9 , 13 · D 13 , c c 3 , where D 3 ,cc is the expected time-duration of State 3, where 9 ∈ s d 3 , c c = d min , 3 , and 14 ∈ s d 3 , c c = d max , 3 . Given the expected value, the distribution parameters of time-durations are estimated. Integration of State Sequences. The state sequence of the cooling coil is estimated given its forward variable αi,cc (t), i = 1, 2, 3 and 4; t = 1, \u2026, K as. (37) s cc ( t ) = arg max i Pr ( s cc ( t ) = i ) ≈ arg max i α i , c c ( t ) , w i t h (38) α i , c c 1 = π i , c c b i ( O cc ( 1 ) ) , a n d (39) α i , c c ( t ) = ∑ d = 1 t α j , c c ( t - d ) a ji , c c p i , c c ( d ) ∏ s = t - d + 1 t b i O cc ( s ) , The variable bi (Occ (s)) of the state sequence is estimated based on those of joint states and the mapping matrix Rcc as, (40) b i O cc ( t ) = arg max j Pr s cc ( t ) = j | arg max i Pr ( s js , c c ( t ) = i ) . where Pr(scc (t) = j |sjs,cc (t) = i) is obtained from the matrix Rcc . Based on the state transition matrix, time-duration parameters, and the state sequence obtained above, the cooling coil\u2019s RULs are predicted via the backward recursive method presented in subsection 3.4. Similarly, to estimate RULs of the AHU, more faults, e.g., a decrease in the supply fan efficiency feff,sf , of other components are considered. The physics-based model of the AHU is obtained by combining the physics-based models of the cooling coil and the supply fan. Then, the method presented above is used to predict the RULs of the AHU. 5 Simulation results Our fault prognosis method is implemented in MATLAB. Real data, e.g., ASHRAE-1312 data, are usually used to test the fault diagnosis method developed for AHUs. In the ASHRAE-1312 project, no gradual faults are implemented. As discussed in Section 1, only gradual faults can be predicted. Thus, simulation data but not ASHRAE-1312 data are used to test our fault prognosis method. To generate simulation data, a small building consisting of two rooms and an AHU is simulated via DesignBuilder and EnergyPlus. DesignBuilder is used to establish a rough simulation model for the small building and its HVAC [31]. Then, EnergyPlus is used to further set parameters of the HVAC, and simulate faults by changing fault-related parameters [25]. Since the AHU usually has a long life, the small building with the AHU is simulated for three years to validate our fault prognosis method. In this paper, only the data points under the cooling mode and the occupied mode from 6/1 to 9/22 in each year are considered. For the cooling coil, both tube fouling and dust on fins are simulated six times, and their time-durations are assumed to follow Poisson distributions. In the simulation model, the tube inside diameter dtube,in is set as 0.01445 m; the surface area of fins is set as 43.59555 m2; and the fan efficiency is set as 0.7. To simulate the tube fouling, dtube,in is reduced by 50% gradually. Similarly, dust on fins is simulated via reducing Afin by 50% gradually. Additionally, a decrease in the supply fan efficiency is simulated five times. In our fault prognosis method, nine fault-related measurements in Table. 1 are required, including 1) the mixed air temperature Ta,mix ; 2) the humidity ratio of mixed air Wa,mix ; 3) the supply air temperature Ta,sup ; 4) the humidity ratio of supply air Wa,sup ; 5) the supply air mass flow rate m ̇ a , sup ; 6) the supply chilled water temperature Tchw,sup ; 7) the return chilled water temperature Tchw,rn ; 8) the chilled water flow rate m ̇ chw ; and 9) the supply fan power Qsf . The time-series plots of these measurements on 07/01/2018 are shown in Fig. 6 . As shown in Fig. 6, the supply chilled water temperature Tchw,sup is 10 °C which is a constant. The chilled water mass flow rate m ̇ chw is adjusted to allow the supply air temperature Ta,sup to approximate to its setpoint 14 °C under the feedback control. Additionally, the trend of the two curves of the supply fan power Qsf and the supply air mass flow rate m ̇ a , sup are similar since the supply fan consumes electricity to supply air. The simulation data of these measurements are collected every 10 mins. Therefore, 45,793 data points were collected from 6/1 to 9/22 in three years, i.e., 2016, 2017 and 2018. The simulation data were divided into two groups, where 50% of the data is used for training and the rest is used for testing. In the simulation model of the AHU, the setpoint of the supply air temperature is 14 °C; and the cooling setpoint of the zone temperature is 24 °C. The controller looks at the difference between the actual zone temperature and the desired temperature to ascertain if heating or cooling is required and then sends appropriate signals to the air system components to drive the zone temperature closer to the desired value. Experiment 1: Estimate States of HSMMs by Using Our Scaled Algorithm. Fault severities of ftube,cc are estimated by using the Viterbi algorithm with our scaled algorithm and are shown in Fig. 7 . The x-axis of this figure is the time t and the time unit is 10 mins; the y-axis is the state of ftube,cc . Black lines are actual states and blue lines are estimated states. F-measure is used to evaluate the accuracy of estimated states since it reflects both the correct and false identification rates [32]. The closer the F-measure gets to 1, and the bigger the F-measure is, the more accurate the estimates are. In this experiment, F-measures of the normal condition, fault severity 1, fault severity 2, and fault severity 3 are 0.998, 0.946, 0.835 and 0.928, which are close to 1 and thus are accurate. However, if the original scaled algorithm is used [27], estimates are shown in Fig. 8 . Since δ ̂ i ( t ) of all states approximate to ∞ at 9/9, the default value of state estimate is 0 shown in the black box of Fig. 8. Thus, states are falsely estimated. Experiment 2: Filter Out False Estimates via Our Discrete SPC Method. By using our discrete SPC method to filter out false alarms, state estimates of the cooling coil are shown in Fig. 9 . F-measures of the normal condition, ftube,cc , and ffin,cc are 0.998, 0.992, and 0.982. However, if the discrete SPC method is not used, F-measures of the normal condition, ftube,cc , and ffin,cc are 0.973, 0.969, and 0.947 as shown in Fig. 10 , which are worse than those of using the filtering method. Experiment 3: Estimate the Cooling Coil\u2019s RULs. RULs of the cooling coil are predicted as shown in Fig. 11 . The x-axis of this figure is the time t and the time unit is 10 mins; the y-axis is the RUL of the cooling coil at time t. Black lines are actual RULs and blue lines are estimated RULs. The differences between actual values and estimated values of RULs are small as shown in Fig. 11. As discussed in [33], five performance metrics are used to measure the performance of our method. In this experiment, the accuracy equals 0.636, thus the RULs are relatively precise. The dispersion of the precision measure is around 110.4 time units, thus is relatively good. The mean absolute percentage error quantifying the mean error in percentage is 74.863 time unit, and is 7.5 h. The value of the prognostics horizon is 52 time units. This means that estimates of RULs entered the confidence intervals of the actual RULs after the launch of our method by 5.2 h. As same as in [26], the parameter λc is set as 0.5 for the Pα-λ measure, namely, the middle of the data length λcT = 0.5 T. The value of the measure being \u2018Yes\u2019 means that the estimates are in the confidence interval at 0.5 T. For the relative accuracy measure, the parameter λc is set as [0.25 0.5 0.75] which corresponds to three-time intervals, including 1) the beginning of data; 2) the middle of data; and 3) the end of data. Relative accuracies are [0.662 0.595 0.845] corresponding to the three intervals, and are relatively precise. Additionally, the time required by our method to estimate RULs is reduced by 77.8% compared to establishing HSMMs of the cooling coil. Experiment 4: Estimate the AHU\u2019s RULs. Similarly, as shown in Fig. 12 , RULs of the AHU are estimated. The five performance metrics are also calculated as shown in Table 3 . It can be found that errors of RULs of the AHU are larger than those of the cooling coil. This is because the physics-based model of the AHU is more complicated than those of the cooling coil and the supply fan. Therefore, the model\u2019s discretization of the AHU introduces more information loss compared to those of the cooling coil and the supply fan. 6 Conclusion This paper presents a fault prognosis method combining HSMM and SPC to estimate RULs of an AHU and its components. A scaled method is developed to improve the Viterbi algorithm by avoiding probabilities of states approximating infinity. To improve the accuracy of state estimates, a discrete SPC is developed to filter out false estimates of HSMM states. To estimate RULs of an AHU and its components with multiple failure modes efficiently, HSMMs of failure modes are integrated to obtain HSMMs of the AHU and its components directly rather than establish HSMMs, leading to a decrease in the amount of computation.

        "dc:description": "Air handling units are key sub-systems of heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, which are used to condition air to satisfy human comfort requirements. Fault prognosis allows maintenance crews to identify the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of a system, thus unexpected breakdowns are avoided, leading to a decrease in maintenance costs. To estimate RULs, a Hidden Semi-Markov Model (HSMM)-based method is proposed. To estimate states of HSMMs accurately, a revised scaled method is developed to guarantee that state estimates do not approximate to infinity. Additionally, a new discrete statistical process control method is developed to filter out false state estimates of HSMMs. To estimate RULs of components and systems accurately and effectively, a backward recursive method is developed to integrate HSMMs\u2019 parameters of time-duration distributions for multiple failure modes to generate those of components and systems directly, thus low computational effort is achieved. Experimental results illustrate that the RULs of components/systems can be predicted by our method accurately in an efficient way.",
