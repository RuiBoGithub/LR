In data-driven automated fault detection and diagnostics (AFDD) modeling for building energy systems, feature engineering is a critical process of extracting information from high-dimensional and noisy sensor measurement and turning it into informative and representative inputs or features for data-driven modeling. However, few studies specifically discuss the feature engineering, especially the interactions between feature extraction and feature selection in whole-building AFDD. We developed a systematic feature extraction and selection framework for whole-building AFDD. In this framework, features are aggressively extracted from raw sensor data using statistical feature extraction techniques with various window sizes and statistics. With many features extracted, a hybrid feature selection algorithm that combines the filter and wrapper method then selects the best feature set. The framework considers diversity in the duration of fault behavior among fault types in whole-building AFDD, thus achieving high model generalization. We implemented our developed framework in a virtual testbed calibrated with measured data from Oak Ridge National Laboratory's Flexible Research Platform designed to mimic the operation of a typical small commercial building. The AFDD model is trained by the simulation data generated from the virtual testbed. The results show that (1) the developed framework improves the generalization of the AFDD model by 10.7% compared with literature-reported feature extraction and selection methods and (2) features with diverse window sizes and statistics are selected, providing insight into physical systems beyond the current understanding of buildings and faults and improving the detection and diagnostics of multiple fault types. Keywords Automated fault detection and diagnostics Whole-building AFDD Statistical feature extraction Feature selection Feature engineering Commercial building 1 Introduction Equipment faults and control errors are pervasive in today's commercial buildings [1]. Building faults waste a substantial amount of energy each year\u20140.3 to 1.9 EJ (EJ, or 1018 J) of primary energy in the United States [2], or 5%\u201315% of energy used in the commercial buildings sector [3]. Fault detection and diagnostics (FDD) detects operational faults (fault detection) and identifies their root causes (fault diagnostics). Automated fault detection and diagnostics (AFDD) performs FDD automatically with minimal human intervention. Properly implemented, AFDD enables building operators to simultaneously improve comfort and reduce energy use, closing the gap between actual and optimal building performance [4]. AFDD methods have three broad categories: AFDD methods have three broad categories: qualitative, quantitative, and process history-based (or history-data-driven). A subset of process history-based models is \u201cblack-box\u201d, or purely data-driven model (hereafter referred to as \u201cdata-driven\u201d) [1,5]. Data-driven methods mathematically relate measured inputs to measured outputs. The advantages of data-driven methods are simplicity, high level of automation, and low development-engineering effort. However, data-driven methods have a high demand for both data size and data quality. With decreasing hardware cost and increasing data accessibility, massive measurements are collected from sensors and meters, the high demand for data size can be met, and data-driven methods have been broadly applied. Kim and Katipamula [6] reviewed 197 publications and 62% of them use data-driven or history-based modeling. Building AFDD methods can be also categorized as component-level or whole-building-level. Whole-building AFDD analyzes energy performance holistically at the building scale, rather than for individual equipment [4]. The faults in whole-building AFDD\u2014from sub-systems including lighting, chiller, variable-air-volume (VAV) box, air-handling unit (AHU), duct, control, etc.\u2014have complicated symptoms and interactions, making the AFDD process more challenging than at the component level. The focus of this paper is on a data-driven whole-building AFDD model. Data used for data-driven AFDD modeling are collected from sensors and meters. The process of transformation from sensor data into a compact yet information-preserving form is known as feature extraction [1] in the field of machine learning. To clarify, \u201cfeature\u201d in this paper is a term in the language of machine learning, which has the same meaning as \u201cinput\u201d and \u201cvariable\u201d. Time-series feature extraction is one of the key techniques for extracting information from high-dimensional and noisy sensor data and turning it into informative and representative features (or inputs) for data-driven modeling. This technique is often used in building AFDD where the fault reporting rate is much lower than the sensor sampling rate. Four main types of feature extraction methods have been found in previous AFDD studies: statistical, principal component analysis (PCA)-based, spectral, and deep learning feature extraction. Statistical feature extraction uses statistical measures (mean, minimum, maximum, standard deviation, variance, range, etc.) in a certain length of time segment (window) to extract features from time-series data. Statistical feature extraction using the mean value is also termed piecewise aggregate approximation (PAA) [7]. The window size and the statistical measure(s) used are the key parameters of statistical feature extraction. Some researchers use simple statistical feature extraction across one fault-reporting timescale. Seem [8] describes a method for detecting abnormal energy consumption in buildings based on daily readings of energy consumption. The feature extraction determines features by calculating daily (24-h window) mean and maximum energy data. Miller [9] studied the pattern recognition used in building fault detection, commissioning, and retrofit analysis techniques. The authors applied symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX), a PAA-based approach, to extract features from time-series building sensor data. They also compared SAX with different window sizes and found the optimal window size with the best balance between number of patterns and resolution of detail. Xiao and Fan [10] use multiple window sizes (5/6/8 h) and statistical measures (standard deviation, mean, minimum, maximum) to extract features from building energy consumption for daily energy consumption pattern clustering. Among time-series feature extraction techniques, statistical feature extraction is one of the most widely used techniques to process sensor data. However, as can be seen from Table 1 , much existing research uses a large window size of feature extraction, which averages too much information from sensors. Also, most researchers use constant window size to extract features, which is inappropriate for whole-building AFDD modeling in which different fault types have diverse characteristics and durations of abnormal behavior that are best captured using varying window sizes. A large window size cannot detect faults that happen abruptly; a small window size cannot capture faults with long-term impact. Introducing multiple window sizes, especially small window sizes, greatly increases the number of features, which may cause overfitting problems that decrease model generalization. Feature selection is a key technique for finding optimal model complexity and generalization to defy overfitting or underfitting, which strongly affects the performance of a data-driven AFDD algorithm. There are three objectives of feature selection: improving the prediction performance of features, providing faster and more cost-effective features, and providing a better understanding of the underlying process that generated the data [11]. However, the combination of feature extraction and selection in data-driven AFDD modeling process is rarely systematically studied. Feature selection techniques, including filter, wrapper, embedded, and hybrid methods, have been studied in AFDD for building HVAC systems such as AHU, VAV boxes, and chillers, as well as for whole-building AFDD. The filter method is a statistical method that assigns a score to each feature, ranks the features by the score, and eventually either keeps or removes the feature based on the ranking. Li et al. [12] employ feature selection techniques of a mutual-information-based filter method named information greedy feature filter (IGFF) in AHU AFDD. Compared with AFDD results with all features, empirically selected features, and features selected by state-of-the-art feature selection methods, IGFF outperforms the others for the dataset of ASHRAE Research Project 1312. Wrapper feature selection is a model-based method that evaluates features set by set and determines the final feature set that can reach the maximum accuracy under a certain model. It is an exhaustive and computationally expensive search method. Namburu et al. [13] implemented the simple genetic algorithm (SGA) feature selection technique to determine the optimal sensor suite for maximum diagnosability in chiller AFDD applications. The authors also evaluated the performance of selected classification procedures with the optimized sensor suite. They used the benchmark data on a 317-kW real centrifugal chiller test equipment to demonstrate and validate the developed diagnostic procedure. Yan et al. [14] and Mulumba et al. [15] incorporated auto-regressive models with exogenous variables (ARX) and support vector machines in chiller AFDD application. They used a feature selection algorithm called ReliefF [16] when modeling timeseries ARX model. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of their method over conventional approaches with higher prediction accuracy and lower false alarm rates. The embedded method performs feature selection as part of the learning procedure and is usually specific to given learning algorithms. Tree-based methods, such as decision tree, random forest, etc., can intrinsically perform feature selection, which saves the efforts to analyze and determine features [17]. Yan et al. [18] presented a decision-tree-based data-driven diagnostic strategy for AHUs in which a classification and regression tree (CART) algorithm is used for decision tree induction. The features are automatically selected when training the algorithm. Hybrid feature selection combines two or more of these feature selection techniques. Han et al. [19,20] employ feature selection techniques of mutual-information-based filter and genetic-algorithm-based wrapper method to search for the important sensors in data-driven chiller AFDD applications, which improve AFDD performance while saving initial sensor cost. Improvement of model performance is observed when compared with other feature subsets. To sum up the above literature review about feature extraction and feature selection in whole-building AFDD, compared with other feature extraction categories, statistical feature extraction is the most widely-used and straightforward method for dealing with high-dimensional sensor data. Unlike other categories, it can keep the physical significance of selected features, which is beneficial to data-driven modeling in which physical significance is in great need to strengthen the data-driven modeling process. However, many researchers use statistical feature extraction with limited statistics and large window size, ignoring the different duration and symptoms of abnormality of various faults in whole-building AFDD. Feature selection is widely applied to AFDD research to compress the dataset to find the most informative feature set. However, few studies focus on the collaboration of feature extraction and feature selection. In general, no comprehensive methodology to guide feature extraction and selection in the development of a data-driven whole-building AFDD model has been presented in the literature to date. This paper developed a framework to fill in the gap between existing feature extraction techniques and high demand for information extraction in whole-building AFDD, and to fill in the blank in the integration of feature extraction and feature selection study in whole-building AFDD. In this framework, features are extracted aggressively from raw sensor data using feature extraction techniques with various statistics and window sizes. Given the many extracted features, a hybrid feature selection process using the filter and wrapper methods selects the optimal feature set based on cross-validation. The framework, for the first time, integrates feature extraction and selection in a systematic way and demonstrates the benefit of the integration in whole-building AFDD modeling. The significance of this paper includes (1) providing a generic workflow for feature engineering in AFDD modeling; (2) integrating feature extraction with feature selection, ensuring both rich sensor information and high computation speed; and (3) significantly improving the AFDD accuracy according to the designed tests compared with other literature-reported feature engineering methods. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the systematic feature extraction and selection framework for data-driven whole-building AFDD. In Section 3, we apply the developed framework and validate it in a virtual testbed that is calibrated on Oak Ridge National Laboratory's Flexible Research Platform. Results are analyzed in Section 4. In Section 5, conclusions are drawn, and future work is introduced. 2 Feature extraction and selection framework for whole-building AFDD The framework is designed to guide the feature engineering for data-driven whole-building AFDD algorithms. The framework focuses on the integration of feature selection with feature extraction, thus providing a complete workflow for generating an optimal feature set. The framework starts with raw sensor data available from energy meters, a building automation system (if present), weather stations, or other similar sources. The logic of the framework is to aggressively extract information from these sensor data, even when huge numbers of features are produced. Subsequently, the framework uses feature selection techniques to reduce the feature space to an optimal feature set with the highest generalization (or cross-validation accuracy). 2.1 Step 1. feature extraction with multiple window sizes and statistics In building AFDD algorithms, the fault reporting rate is normally lower than the sensor sampling rate (i.e., the interval at which sensors are sampled more frequently than the interval at which faults are reported). In the example in Fig. 2, the fault reporting interval is 24 h, which means that the result of AFDD (Is there a fault? What fault it is?) is given every 24 h, but the sensor sampling interval is 15 min. For each fault reporting interval, there are 96 sampled values for each sensor. Fig. 2 shows two examples of statistical feature extraction: taking the mean value statistic in a 3-h window compresses the sensor data into eight features and taking the maximum in a 4-h window compresses the sensor data into six features. Feature extraction with multiple window sizes and statistics is developed and tested in this paper to explore its impact on model improvement. Under fault reporting timescale of 24 h, multiple window sizes (such as 24 h, 6 h, 3 h, and 1 h) and multiple statistics (such as mean, maximum, minimum, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis) are applied to each window size. Fig. 1 shows the framework of the feature extraction process: there are m different window sizes, and for each window size, p i (i∈ [1,m]) windows can be extracted; under the same window, there are k different statistics, and total of k * m statistical feature extraction methods being applied to data from each sensor; and the total number of extracted features is n ∗ k ∗ ∑ i = 1 m p i . To look at a simple example, if there are two sensors (sensor 1 and sensor 2), two statistics (maximum and minimum), and two window sizes (6 h and 12 h) under a fault report interval of 24 h and sensor sampling interval of 15 min, then the total number of feature extracted is 2 ∗ 2 ∗ ∑ i = 1 2 p i = 4 ∗ ( p 1 + p 2 ) = 4 ∗ ( 24 h o u r 6 h o u r + 24 h o u r 12 h o u r ) = 24 features. The features extracted are listed in Table 2 . The example case is a simple one with only a few sensors, statistics, and window sizes. In a more realistic case, for example, where there are 200 sensors with 6 statistics and window sizes of 24 h, 12 h, 8 h, 6 h, 4 h, 3 h, 2 h and 1 h, the number of extracted features is 200 * 6 * (24/24 + 24/12 + 24/8 + 24/6 + 24/4 + 24/3 + 24/2 + 24/1) = 72,000, which is a very aggressive feature extraction process. The aggressive feature extraction strategy can be beneficial to whole-building AFDD because multiple fault types have differing characteristics and durations of abnormality, which can only be reflected by various window sizes and statistics. For example, long-term faults such as fan motor degradation and biased sensors can be detected by features with large window size and mean statistics. Short-term faults such as lighting and HVAC abnormal schedule setback cause abrupt changes that persist for a short period of time and are therefore more easily detected by features with small window size with statistics of maximum or minimum. 2.2 Step 2. feature selection with a hybrid method The number of extracted features will greatly increase with multiple window sizes and statistics. Feature selection is an important step following feature extraction to defy high data dimensionality and the overfitting problem. The feature selection process in this study uses the similar framework in Zhang and Wen [21], which uses a hybrid method that combines filter method and wrapper method to decide the final feature set for a data-driven building energy model. Fig. 3 shows a diagram of the feature selection process. In the feature selection procedure, the filter method is a statistical method with high computational efficiency. It is often used as coarse selection and pre-processing of features. Because the number of features after feature extraction is large, it is reasonable to use the filter method first to coarsely select features. However, the filter method has uncertainty: a feature with poor statistical significance does not necessarily mean that the feature has no contribution to the model [11]. On the other hand, wrapper feature selection is a model-based method. It evaluates features set by set and determines the final feature set that can reach the maximum accuracy under a certain model. It is an exhaustive and computationally expensive search method: a new model is built to evaluate each feature set. However, unlike the filter method, little uncertainty exists in the wrapper method. The filter method is a coarse selection method, while the wrapper method is a refined method. The wrapper method is often used after the filter method because the filter method can quickly prune the candidate feature set, reducing the computational expense of the wrapper method. Therefore, integrating the filter method with the wrapper method provides an opportunity to compensate for each method's deficiencies. Fig. 3 summarizes the feature selection procedures. The input of the feature selection module is the output of the feature extraction module: the aggressively attracted features and their values. First, the filter method is applied to coarsely select features by removing redundant and irrelevant features defined by statistical methods such as the Pearson correlation coefficient (for correlation between two numerical features), ANOVA F-value (for correlation between a numerical feature and a categorical feature). The output of the filter method will be the input of the wrapper method, in which a searching method is applied to decide the feature subsets to be evaluated. Each feature subset is evaluated by building an AFDD model using the feature subset and evaluating the subset by the performance (e.g., cross-validation error) of the built model. The feature subset of the model with the best performance is selected as the final feature set for the AFDD model. It is worth mentioning that the developed framework does not provide general conclusions of what features to use for all buildings but provides a generic workflow to generate specific features for specific buildings. It is also worth mentioning that since this framework needs true fault labels for each data point, it is only applicable to the cases where fault labels are available. One of the suitable applications is real building with good labeled fault data. Notably, such buildings are rare. Another suitable application scenario of this framework is to study the building fault simulation data, and the simulation is calibrated on or is the \u201cdigital twin\u201d of real buildings, so that the knowledge and conclusions of feature extraction and selection from this framework can be transferred from simulations to real buildings. 3 Case study To validate the developed feature extraction and selection framework, we applied it to a whole-building AFDD algorithm using a virtual testbed. The algorithm is a variation of the whole-building AFDD approach presented in Frank et al. [4], while the virtual testbed is a whole-building energy model of Oak Ridge National Laboratory's two-story Flexible Research Platform (FRP) facility. 3.1 Virtual testbed The virtual testbed is a calibrated EnergyPlus [22] model of Oak Ridge National Laboratory's two-story FRP [23,24]. The FRP is a small-sized (3200 ft2) commercial building that has a single packaged rooftop unit (RTU) connected to a multi-zone VAV system. The FRP is designed to imitate the construction and operation of a 1980s-era small office building typical of the southeastern United States. The RTU is a 12.5-ton unit that includes a natural-gas heating coil and the connected VAV system serves a total of 10 zones (8 perimeter and 2 core) with electric resistance reheat. Table 3 shows more details about the building characteristics. Fig. 4 shows the outlook of the building and the virtual testbed. Fig. 5 shows the building floor and system layout. The floor plan (on the left) provides actual zoning of two floors in the Flexible Research Platform and the schematic of the HVAC system (on the right) includes the layout of the rooftop unit connected to the variable-air-volume (VAV) system described in Table 3. More details about the testbed can be found in Ref. [25]. 3.2 Simulated faults To generate a data set for evaluation of the framework, 26 faults with multiple fault intensities are simulated in the virtual testbed (Table 4 ). Each fault model is applied as a model perturbation script using OpenStudio as a wrapper for the EnergyPlus model (https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio-fault-models). The fault model development and simulation details can be found in Ref. [26,27]. The fault model modifies properties of normal operating conditions into faulted conditions during the entire simulation period. Fault intensity levels are determined based on either application ranges that are defined in the experimental measurements (for training fault models) or reasonable ranges that are acquired from a literature review [28]. The detailed fault intensity introduction and definition can be found in our previous study [26,27]. A total of 99 faulted scenarios are considered for 26 fault models. Each scenario is simulated for seven different weather conditions: six typical meteorological year (TMY) weather files and one actual meteorological year (AMY) weather file (listed in Table 5 ). Thus, a total of 700 simulations (99 faulted scenarios and 1 non-faulted scenario for 7 different weather conditions) are simulated. Multiple weather files were selected for training to cover a variety of climate zones, including zones with extreme weather conditions beyond those expected to be experienced by the target building. This helps ensure that the training space is fully covered. The locations chosen include a hot, arid location (Riyadh); a cold, dry location (Fairbanks); a hot, humid/tropical location (Miami); a cold, humid location (Duluth), and mixed-humid locations (Louisville, Richmond, and Knoxville). There are two limitations of the fault simulation method used. First, one fault happens at one time; cases where multiple faults occur simultaneously are not considered. Second, the simulated fault does not change or evolve; that is, fault intensity remains constant throughout the simulation time. 3.3 Data for training, validation, and testing Data used for data-driven modeling are collected from virtual sensors in the EnergyPlus model. Virtual sensors used in the case study are commonly available from a building automation system (BAS), thermostats, electrical power meters, or meteorological sensors. A few virtual sensors are not commonly used in a building automation system but are evaluated because of their potential to provide useful diagnostics information. To be more specific, heating electricity [W], interior equipment electricity [W], and interior lights electricity [W] are submeters that are uncommon to building automation system, but these sensors are used in the case study because several fault types are related to the operations of these subsystems and their energy use is a critical indicator of subsystem operations. The inclusion of these uncommon end-use sensors helps better demonstrate the developed framework, if features extracted from these uncommon sensors are actually selected. If we exclude these uncommon sensors, the FDD model, especially the faults related to operations of these subsystems, may perform worse and features from sensors that correlated with these operation schedules will be selected instead, but it will not affect the demonstration of the developed framework. It is worth mentioning that the developed framework does not have any requirement on the selected raw sensors: it only extract information from existing sensors and maximize their information to improve FDD performance. The sampling interval for the virtual sensors is 15 min. Forty-six virtual sensors in the virtual testbed are listed in Table 6 . Data for training and validation are collected from virtual sensors in the simulations of virtual testbed under six TMY weather files representing a diversity of climates; data for testing are collected from that under one AMY weather file representing the design climate for the FRP. To describe training/validation data as a matrix, the number of columns of the matrix is 46 (number of virtual sensors) and the number of rows is 100 simulations/weather file * 6 weather files * 365 days/simulation * 24 h/day * 4 samples/hour = 21,024,000 samples for each sensor. The training/validation data are visualized in Fig. 6 . Similarly, the testing data can be described as a 3,504,000 × 46 matrix. 3.4 Settings of data-driven AFDD modeling 3.4.1 Inputs and output of data-driven model The data-driven AFDD model is a multiclass classification algorithm with 26 fault types (shown in Table 4) and one non-fault type as 27 classes. The algorithm represents an extension of the research presented in Ref. [4]. The inputs of the model are the extracted and selected features obtained from virtual sensors documented in Table 6. Model output is a class label corresponding to the non-faulted case or one of the 26 faults. Model output is generated for each day, which corresponds to the fault reporting interval. 3.4.2 Data-driven algorithm: random forest Random forest is the data-driven algorithm used for AFDD modeling and the data-driven part in the wrapper method in this study. Random forest is an ensemble method that builds predictive models for both classification and regression problems. Ensemble methods use multiple learning models to gain better predictive results\u2014in the case of a random forest, the model creates an entire forest of random uncorrelated decision trees and then applies a consensus algorithm to arrive at the best possible answer. Random forest has been applied to data-driven AFDD research [4,29]. In this study, random forest algorithm is realized by scikit-learn (version 0.21.2), a Python package for machine learning [30]. The parameter values of random forest are listed in Table 7 . Most of the parameters are set to the default values in scikit-learn, except the estimator number, or the number of trees, which is decided by an unreported test which indicates that the random forest accuracy stops increasing when the number of trees reaches 250. 3.4.3 Model performance metric for multiclass classification Conceptually, fault detection and fault diagnostics are two different process and are normally evaluated using two separate performance metrics, even if performed in a single classification step. However, to quantify AFDD model performance for the purposes of selecting the best model feature set, a comprehensive performance metric that combines fault detection and diagnostics in a single score is needed. Therefore, a combined detection and diagnostics rate (CDDR) [31] (Equation (1)) is used in this study. Fig. 7 illustrates the confusion matrix elements used to calculate CDDRtotal. 3.5 Application of developed framework The developed framework (Section 2) is applied to the virtual sensor data to generate features (or inputs) for the data-driven AFDD model. First, feature extraction using multiple window sizes and statistics generates a large list of features from the raw sensor data. Then, a hybrid feature selection process using the filter method of Minimum Redundancy and Maximum Relevance (MRMR) followed by the wrapper method of Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) embedded in the random forest algorithm selects the optimal feature set. 3.5.1 Feature extraction The window size and the statistics are the two key parameters of statistical feature extraction. Six statistics are used in this case study: mean, standard deviation, maximum, minimum, skewness, and kurtosis. Of these, skewness and kurtosis are rarely used in the prior research. Skewness (Equation (2)) is a measure for the degree of symmetry in the variable distribution. Kurtosis (Equation (3)) is a measure of the degree of peakedness/flatness in the variable distribution. Both quantify the shape of a data distribution. (2) S k e w n e s s = m 3 m 2 3 2 , w h e r e m r = ∑ i = 1 n ( x i − x \u203e ) r n (3) K u r t o s i s = m 4 m 2 2 , w h e r e m r = ∑ i = 1 n ( x i − x \u203e ) r n Multiple window sizes are applied in the case study. The fault reporting interval is 24 h, and the window sizes for feature extraction include 24 h, 12 h, 6 h, 3 h, 2 h, and 1 h (factors of 24 h). Table 8 lists the number of features extracted using the six statistics and six window sizes. 3.5.2 Feature selection 3.5.2.1 Filter method: Minimum Redundancy and Maximum Relevance (MRMR) MRMR is a widely used filter feature selection technique. It selects features having the greatest correlation with the output (relevance) and the least correlation among themselves (redundancy). In MRMR, the features are ranked according to the quantified redundancy and relevance. In this study, relevance and redundancy are quantified and ranked using the F-statistic and Pearson correlation coefficient, respectively. Details of MRMR in this case study are listed in Table 9 . For maximum relevance, metrics of ANOVA F-value are used to remove the least relevant features at the threshold of 3.95, which is a common threshold indicating irrelevancy at an alpha level of 0.1. The number of features is reduced from 14,076 to 4209. Then, for minimum redundancy, Pearson correlation coefficient is used to remove one of two features with correlation greater than 0.99975. The number of features is reduced from 4209 to 2796. The 2796 features are left after the MRMR method and are further selected using the wrapper method. The threshold of the filter method is decided by the computing power of the computer. The features selected by the filter method will be the input of the wrapper method, and the wrapper method is a computationally expensive method that can only deal with a limited number of features given the computing power. In our case, the limit of feature counts is 3,000, otherwise the computational time will exceed 72 h under the computer's configuration of Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8850H CPU at 2.6 GHz and 16.0 GB of installed memory. To reduce the number of features less than 3000 before wrapper method, the thresholds of filter method (3.95 and 0.99975) are decided accordingly. 3.5.2.2 Wrapper method: Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) embedded in random forest RFE is a model-based wrapper feature selection technique: it wraps an embedded model with a feature set selection algorithm. RFE searches for the best feature set by recursively removing features from the candidate feature set, then building the wrapped model using the remaining features until the model achieves maximum accuracy. The feature set with the maximum model accuracy is the optimal feature set. In this study, RFE is embedded with a random forest model. The parameters of random forest used for RFE are those presented in Table 7. The details of RFE used in this study are shown in Fig. 8 . The starting feature set for RFE is the output of the MRMR filter method (Table 9). The RFE algorithm first performs shuffled four-fold cross-validation and calculates the average CDDR of the four-fold cross-validation. In each fold, a feature set is selected by random forest algorithm. Among four folds, the feature sets may be selected differently, but with some overlapping features. The union of the four feature sets in each fold is used as the starting feature set in the next step. The algorithm then repeats the above procedure with the new starting features, calculating the four-fold cross-validation CDDR of the model using the selected feature set in each iteration and comparing it with the CDDR of the last iteration. The process repeats until CDDR decreases. Use the starting feature set of the last step (which represents the output feature set of the step with the highest average CDDR) as the final feature set. Fig. 9 shows how RFE selected the final feature set in this study. First, RFE starts with the feature set produced by MRMR, whose initial feature number is 2796. The algorithm produces successively smaller feature sets: 921 in Step 1, 366 in Step 2, etc., until reaching a final value of 202 features in Step 3. The final feature set includes 202 features; the top 20 features are listed in Table 10 . Electricity consumption, rooftop unit operation status, and room temperatures are the major feature categories to identify faults in this case study. Also, other features from these categories are repeatedly selected with various statistics and window sizes. The relatively small number of selected features and the low cross-validation error indicates the features are representative and concise to detect faults. Shuffled four-fold cross-validation CDDRtotal is 0.862; the CDDRtotal of the test data set is 0.810. The selected features are further analyzed and discussed in Section 4. It is worth mentioning that the features selected above apply only to this specific case study; the feature extraction and selection framework selects different feature set for different buildings. 4 Results and discussion In this section, we first compare the performance of the model achieved using the developed feature selection framework compared with that of a baseline model that uses a simple feature extraction technique with constant and large window size. Second, we analyze the key features selected by the developed framework for each fault type. The selected features map to key symptoms associated with each fault. 4.1 Comparison with baseline model To demonstrate the importance of feature extraction/selection and the effectiveness of the developed framework, the model built by the developed framework is compared with a baseline model built using a simple feature extraction and selection method. The baseline model uses a constant large window size (24 h, same as the fault reporting timescale) and four common statistics (mean, standard deviation, maximum, and minimum) for feature extraction. Feature selection is limited to the inherent feature selection performed as part of generating the random forest model. The shuffled four-fold cross-validation CDDR is used to evaluate both models. Both models use the same data source, data-driven algorithm (random forest), and parameters. The final feature set by of the baseline model has 52 features. The top 20 ranked features are shown in Table 11 . The shuffled four-fold cross-validation CDDRtotal of the baseline method is 0.779, which is 9.6% lower than the model by the developed method; the CDDRtotal for the test data is 0.723, which is 10.7% lower than the developed method. With the developed method, fewer features are selected, and higher accuracy is achieved, indicating that the developed method extracts more condensed and informative features from the original data set. The performance of two models are also quantified by comparison of the true positive rate (TPR) of each fault type (Table 12 ). The developed method achieves much higher accuracy for several fault types, including AHU fan motor degradation (TPR increases from 0.70 to 0.84), biased mixed air temperature sensor (TPR from 0.48 to 0.79), duct fouling (TPR from 0.47 to 0.82), outdoor air damper stuck (TPR from 0.70 to 0.79), HVAC setback error delayed onset (TPR from 0.79 to 0.96), HVAC setback error early termination (TPR from 0.90 to 0.99), and return air duct leakage (TPR from 0.39 to 0.69). The TPRs of remaining fault types remain the same or decrease a little. 4.2 Analysis of the key features selected This section analyzes the most important features selected for each fault type, which can yield understanding of the symptoms and characteristics of specific faults. Table 13 shows the top 3 features for each fault type. Among four lighting-related faults (delayed onset, early termination, no overnight setback, and improper time delay setting in occupancy sensor), the selected features include long-term/short-term lighting electricity and total building electricity consumptions. The lighting setback faults affect lighting electricity and total building electricity consumptions directly due to improper control of the lighting setback schedule, while the improper time delay setting in occupancy sensors indirectly affects the lighting schedule via controls coupled to the occupancy sensor installed in the thermal zone. Thus, the selection of prioritized sensors is reasonable. However, the statistics of skewness was selected for the lighting setback error (delayed onset) fault instead of the mean that was selected for the other two lighting setback faults (early termination and no overnight setback). While the regular building occupied period in the virtual testbed is defined between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m., the hours of delay in setback fault were simulated up to 3 h. There is also a limitation in this simulated fault in which the delayed onset (or early termination) cannot propagate to the next day (or to the previous day). Thus, the impact of the 3 h in delay of setback is the same as the impact of 2 h of delay, which resulted in smaller overall impact on the lighting energy consumption compared to the other two lighting setback faults. For this reason, it is interpreted as the change in lighting load profile (which can be quantified with the statistics of skewness) of the long-term window and was selected over the impact on the average lighting electricity consumption of the short-term window. Among the three HVAC setback faults (delayed onset, early termination, and no overnight setback), the total HVAC electricity consumption, total building electricity consumption, and supply air temperature to a certain room are selected as major sensors. The change in setback schedule in the HVAC system directly affects the energy consumption of the heating and cooling equipment in the RTU as well as VAV box reheat coils that control room temperatures. Short-term features are selected because setback changes have a short-term impact on energy. To be more specific, for the HVAC setback delayed onset, the most important feature is the last few hours of the total HVAC electricity consumption, while for the early termination, the most important feature is the first few hours of the supply air temperature in room 106. For the early termination fault, the supply air temperature is affected by the earlier start of the room conditioning, which enabled the VAV box to maintain the room temperature setpoint defined for the occupied period. The selection of room 106 can be interpreted as a room with the highest thermal mass that caused the supply air temperature to change significantly to meet the room temperature setpoint. The heating coil air outlet and supply fan outlet temperatures are selected as major sensors for the duct fouling fault. Duct fouling is defined as dust accumulation within the duct system that increases flow resistance in the air system and pressure drop across the supply fan. The increased pressure drop in the supply fan then results in increased fan energy consumption and additional heat gain to the air stream compared to the same air volume in the un-faulted case. One extra feature in the virtual testbed model is that the heat gain from the fan has an impact on the setpoints of the economizer, 1 1 The outside air damper assembly is sometimes referred to as the \u201ceconomizer\u201d in industry literature. The economizer term used in this study also refers to the outside air damper assembly. cooling coil, and heating coil in the RTU. The model predicts the temperature increase caused by the heat gain and subtracts it from the original temperature setpoints, thus mitigating the temperature increase across the fan. While the virtual testbed model has the capability of optimizing the supply air temperature in a system level, RTUs in the field mostly use predefined setpoints and packaged proportional\u2013integral\u2013derivative (PID) controllers. Device internal controls (outdoor air damper, coil valve, electric output, etc.) match the local temperature measurement to the setpoint. Although there is a common practice where the engineer sets the setpoint temperature a couple degrees below the required supply air temperature setpoint to prepare for the heat gain in the air system, typical field controllers are nevertheless less sophisticated than the virtual testbed model used in this study. These setpoints are, however, affected differently by the fault in different times of the season. While the mixed air temperature setpoint is only affected when the economizing is feasible, the cooling coil and heating coil setpoints are affected when either cooling or heating demand is present. Based on the preliminary calculation from the virtual testbed simulation results, all simulation scenarios shown in Table 4 showed that the overall heating demand is dominant over the other two demands. Thus, the selection of the heating coil air outlet temperature as the major sensor is reasonable. The sensors installed within the RTU are also major ones for detecting faults such as AHU fan motor degradation, biased mixed air temperature sensor, outdoor air damper stuck, and return air duct leakages. The temperature sensors located at the outlet of the fan and mixed air chamber were selected as prioritized sensors for the AHU fan motor degradation fault. The AHU fan motor degradation fault results in a decrease of the fan total efficiency. Because the fan causes heat gain to the air stream when it is installed along with the air stream, the inefficient operation of the fan increases the heat gain to the supply air stream, which increases the supply fan outlet air temperature. In this virtual testbed model, the mixed air temperature is controlled by the economizer (with differential enthalpy economizer control) when the outdoor air condition is favorable for free cooling. As described above, the mixed air temperature setpoint is affected by the additional heat gain from the fan. The biased mixed air temperature sensor fault directly affects the setpoint of the mixed air temperature, and thus the selection of major sensors is reasonable. Because the economizer system controls mixed air temperature via the outdoor air and return air dampers, the same set of sensors is also affected when the outdoor air damper is stuck in a certain position. The return air duct leakage is defined as the leakage on the return duct that is exposed to the ambient. The operation of the supply fan installed in the RTU draws air and maintains negative pressure in the return duct. If the leak occurs, outdoor air will be introduced into the return air stream even when it is not needed, which can again result in a change in the mixed air temperature. Changes in mixed air temperature also affect the cooling or heating load in the RTU depending on the weather and operating conditions. Short- and long-term heating electricity consumption were selected for the thermostat bias fault. This fault was simulated in the virtual testbed model by increasing and decreasing the room temperature setpoint up to 3 °C, as shown in Table 4. It should be noted that room temperature setpoint is not among the sensors available to the AFDD algorithm, therefore this method of simulating thermostat bias does not affect algorithm performance. The thermostat measurement bias in all rooms directly affects both heating and cooling energy consumptions. For example, a positively biased thermostat (equivalent to decreased room temperature setpoint) increases the cooling demand in the summer season, but it also reduces the heating demand for the winter season if the fault is present for the entire year. The selection of the heating electricity consumption as a major sensor can be interpreted as the impact on the heating energy being larger than the impact on the cooling energy consumption. The supply air duct leakage is defined as the conditioned air from an RTU being leaked to the unconditioned spaces within the building. The leaked air does not reach the conditioned spaces in the building, but it eventually gathers in the return plenum and flows back through the return duct. There are two major behaviors caused by the supply air duct leakage: reduced airflow to all rooms because the leak occurs before the conditioned air reaches thermal zones and decreased or increased return air temperature during the cooling or heating season, respectively, due to the conditioned air from the RTU leaking back to the return air plenum. During the heating season, the reduced airflow to the conditioned spaces produces insufficient heating capacity and results in additional reheat in the VAV box to maintain comfortable room temperatures. In the cooling season, the reduced airflow results in insufficient cooling capacity for conditioning all rooms and the supply fan will therefore increase speed to meet the demand. On the other hand, the reduced return air temperature provides free cooling opportunity during the cooling season and reduces the load on the cooling coil when dehumidification is required. In the shoulder season when dehumidification is required and the VAV reheat is also called for in the room conditioning, it actually favors the overall energy consumption of the system due to reduced cooling and reheating energy. Sensors such as the supply air temperature to room 106, zone temperature of room 205, and total building electricity consumption were selected as major sensors for this fault. In the virtual testbed simulations, the reduced airflow resulted in increased VAV heating (in heating season), which can also be observed via increased supply air temperature to the thermal zone. In the cooling season, although the supply fan increased the speed to meet the cooling demand, the rated capacity of the RTU was not enough to satisfy the entire cooling demand in the building and resulted in increased room temperatures. For these reasons, the selection of major sensors for the supply air duct leakage fault is also reasonable. One of the advantages of the data-driven method is that it needs little domain knowledge in the modeling process but can still reflect certain physical knowledge in the result. The analysis in this section shows that the developed framework can even provide insight into physical systems. In summary, the analysis performed in this section represents a sanity check as to whether the features selected make sense in light of the original fault models. In this case, the known mechanisms used to model the faults provide the \u201canswer key\u201d for which features are likely to be relevant; the analysis here checks whether the actual features selected match those known to be affected by the fault model. However, in other cases, users of the developed framework either may have no knowledge of or access to the underlying fault models and may have limited understanding of the fault mechanism. By checking the features selected (if they intended to do so), they can better understand the fault mechanism. It is worth mentioning that the features extracted and selected in the case study are only applicable to the particular case study. The developed framework provides a generic workflow to generate specific features for specific buildings. 5 Conclusions In this paper, we develop a systematic feature extraction and selection framework for data-driven AFDD. The major novelties of the framework are: (1) aggressively apply statistical feature extraction techniques to exhaust information from timeseries data and use systematic hybrid feature selection techniques to select optimal feature set with optimal feature numbers, (2) fully automation of feature extraction and selection process without domain knowledge, (3) the automatically selected features can reflect domain knowledge, (4) achieve high model performance because of the characteristics of performance-oriented feature selection process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework using an AFDD algorithm designed for commercial buildings and a virtual testbed that represents a typical small office building. The case study results show that the generalization of data-driven AFDD model (as quantified by CDDR during four-fold cross-validation) is improved by 10.7% compared with literature-reported feature extraction and selection methods, specifically single-window-size feature extraction and simple embedded feature selection methods, without installing any new sensors. With the developed framework, features with various window sizes are selected. Feature extraction with various window sizes and statistics has a positive impact on the diagnostics performance for several fault types, indicating the effectiveness of the aggressive feature extraction provided by the framework. Another advantage of the framework is that it needs little domain knowledge in the modeling process but can still reflect certain physical knowledge in the result. The analysis in Section 4 shows that the developed framework can select feature that provide physical insight in the case study: \u2022 Long-term/short-term lighting electricity and total building electricity consumptions are selected features among four lighting-related faults. \u2022 Among the three HVAC setback faults, the total HVAC electricity consumption, total building electricity consumption, and supply air temperature to a certain room are selected as major sensors. \u2022 The heating coil air outlet and supply fan outlet temperatures are selected as major sensors for the duct fouling fault. \u2022 The sensors installed within the RTU are also major ones for detecting faults such as AHU fan motor degradation, biased mixed air temperature sensor, outdoor air damper stuck, and return air duct leakages. \u2022 Short-term and long-term heating electricity consumption were selected for the thermostat bias fault. Again, it is worth mentioning that the conclusions above are only applicable to the particular case study. The developed framework provides a generic workflow to generate specific features for specific buildings, so the features extracted and selected vary from case to case. The developed framework can improve the AFDD performance, thus improving the energy efficiency and thermal comfort, and reducing operation cost of buildings. Besides, the automatically selected features can provide physical insight so that modelers can better understand the building and AFDD models. However, there are limitations in this study. In this paper, the effectiveness of the developed feature engineering framework is first demonstrated by explaining the characteristics of applied feature extraction and feature selection techniques, and then is shown by a real-building-calibrated-simulation case study. Since this framework needs true fault labels for each data point, it is only applicable to the cases where fault labels are available. One of the suitable applications is real building with good labeled fault data. Notably, such buildings are rare. Another suitable application scenario of this framework is to study the building fault simulation data, and the simulation is calibrated on or is the \u201cdigital twin\u201d of real buildings, so that the knowledge and conclusions of feature extraction and selection from this framework can be transferred from simulations to real buildings. Applying the framework to real buildings, or the validation/verification of transferring knowledge to the real building FDD, is recommended as future work. To be more specific, in terms of experimental verification of the method, it is possible but very time-consuming to replicate faults experimentally in building testbeds to validate the model: it can be done under the right condition, but it requires a whole building testbed and rigorous control of conditions [32], which can also be a part of future work to efficiently design the verification experiments. Moreover, in the simulation setting, one fault happens at one time and fault intensity will not evolve. In the future, a more complicated data-driven model with multiple and changing labels will be considered. Streaming techniques can also be embedded into the framework in the future. Because the fault will evolve and change throughout time, streaming techniques are essential techniques to periodically update the model to adapt to the changing building and faults.

        "dc:description": "In data-driven automated fault detection and diagnostics (AFDD) modeling for building energy systems, feature engineering is a critical process of extracting information from high-dimensional and noisy sensor measurement and turning it into informative and representative inputs or features for data-driven modeling. However, few studies specifically discuss the feature engineering, especially the interactions between feature extraction and feature selection in whole-building AFDD. We developed a systematic feature extraction and selection framework for whole-building AFDD. In this framework, features are aggressively extracted from raw sensor data using statistical feature extraction techniques with various window sizes and statistics. With many features extracted, a hybrid feature selection algorithm that combines the filter and wrapper method then selects the best feature set. The framework considers diversity in the duration of fault behavior among fault types in whole-building AFDD, thus achieving high model generalization. We implemented our developed framework in a virtual testbed calibrated with measured data from Oak Ridge National Laboratory's Flexible Research Platform designed to mimic the operation of a typical small commercial building. The AFDD model is trained by the simulation data generated from the virtual testbed. The results show that (1) the developed framework improves the generalization of the AFDD model by 10.7% compared with literature-reported feature extraction and selection methods and (2) features with diverse window sizes and statistics are selected, providing insight into physical systems beyond the current understanding of buildings and faults and improving the detection and diagnostics of multiple fault types.",
