Statistical analysis-based methods work well for relatively less variables [5]. They are not applicable for complex cyber-physical, e.g., the BAS HVAC. In research of ML, K-nearest neighbor (KNN), self-organizing map (SOM), long short-term memory neural network (LSTM) and so on were proposed to recover missing sensors data. Among them, LSTM-based methods have great potential in the practical application because of their excellent ability in the massive complicated data [13]. Zheng [14] proposed the principal component analysis (PCA) combined with LSTM to recover the temperature data, which obtained the satisfactory result. Zhang [15] presented LSTM with support vector machine to recover missing data. However, the hyperparameters of LSTM have an important impact on the missing data recovery performance for LSTM. In subsequent research, numerous scholars have proposed different method for optimizing LSTM hyperparameters. Yu [16] used genetic algorithm (GA) to optimizes the LSTM hyperparameters. Du [17] proposed a particle swarm optimization (PSO) for LSTM hyperparameters optimizing. Luo [18] proposed whale optimization algorithm (WOA) to optimize hyperparameters of LSTM. Since optimization algorithms such as PSO, GA, WOA and so on are all prone to falling into local optima, there is still great potential for improving the performance of LSTM based on the improved parameters of these methods [19]. Because Fireworks algorithm (FWA) has global optimization and fast convergence speed, Sun [20] adopted to optimize the LSTM's hyperparameters by FWA. Experiments have shown that compared with LSTM and other hyperparameter optimization methods, FWA-LSTM has better performance in application.

Due to the development of sensor networks, Building Automation System (BAS) based heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) has gradually replaced traditional HVAC to improve indoor thermal comfort and decrease energy consumption. Because of inevitable faults in sensors or networks, the real-time sensor data may be incomplete with corrupted, lost or undetected missing values. Therefore, Improved Fireworks Algorithm (IFWA)-Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is proposed to recover incomplete measurements in BAS HVAC sensors. Because sensor data loss mostly results from incorrect control commands from the BAS system or sensor damage, there is a high probability of concurrent sensor fault. Therefore, Independent Component Analysis (ICA)-K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is proposed to monitor the sensor's healthy state under the measurements recovered. This paper discusses the possible causes of incomplete measurement in BAS HVAC sensors and simulates the distribution by experiment. The experiment analyzes the data recovery capability of IFWA-LSTM for different types of missing sensor data in different sensor measurement loss scenarios. The result shows that compared to the comparative methods, IFWA-LSTM achieves a 6.45 %\u201386.92 % improvement in recovery accuracy and a 0.0041 to 0.6340 improvement in correlation coefficients. Subsequently, it discusses the fault diagnosis rate of ICA-KNN under full measurements and incomplete measurement recovered by IFWA-LSTM. Overall, ICA-KNN achieves an average fault diagnosis rate of 99.86 % and an average fault alarm rate of 0 % under full measurement. When applied to incomplete measurement recovered by IFWA-LSTM, ICA-KNN exhibits an average fault diagnosis rate of 92.18 % and an average fault alarm rate of 1.22 %.

It intelligently controls and schedules the physical devices (physical-engineered system) through a cyber control core to achieve low energy consumption, high comfort, productivity and safety requirements of the HVAC [2,3]. To guarantee the precise operation of the cyber control core, numerous sensors are required to construct a sensor network for precise real-time monitoring of the physical equipment working conditions. However, it is difficult to ensure the non-fault operation of the sensor network in the operation and maintenance of the cyber control core. Meanwhile, due to the uncertainty of data storage, transmission and sensor power failure, may cause missing monitoring data from the sensors [3]. Durable and high-intensity work of sensors will also lead to monitoring dataset loss, accuracy decrease or even fault [4,5]. Missing data or failures can lead to incorrect control decisions in HVAC systems, which results in wasted energy [6] (e.g. chiller faulty sensors will increase energy consumption by an additional 20 % [7,8], and air handling unit (AHU) faulty sensors will increase 20%\u201330 % energy consumption [9,10]), thermal comfort decreasing [11] even secondary failures [5]. 1.2 Literature review As shown in Fig. 1 , previous studies have encompassed two aspects: recovery of missing sensor measurement data and fault diagnosis of faulty sensors. In previous research on HVAC sensor fault diagnosis, it was assumed that the sensor measurement data is complete. Therefore, in the literature review, it draws upon the research achievements in the field of data recovery and discusses the current research status of HVAC sensor faults. Based on the above content, it summarizes the challenges faced in current BAS HVAC sensor fault diagnosis from both application and method perspectives. 1.2.1 Missing sensors data recovering In previous research, reconstructing missing data methods can be divided into two broad categories, i.e., statistical analysis-based methods and machine learning (ML)-based methods [12]. Statistical analysis-based methods work well for relatively less variables [5]. They are not applicable for complex cyber-physical, e.g., the BAS HVAC. In research of ML, K-nearest neighbor (KNN), self-organizing map (SOM), long short-term memory neural network (LSTM) and so on were proposed to recover missing sensors data. Among them, LSTM-based methods have great potential in the practical application because of their excellent ability in the massive complicated data [13]. Zheng [14] proposed the principal component analysis (PCA) combined with LSTM to recover the temperature data, which obtained the satisfactory result. Zhang [15] presented LSTM with support vector machine to recover missing data. However, the hyperparameters of LSTM have an important impact on the missing data recovery performance for LSTM. In subsequent research, numerous scholars have proposed different method for optimizing LSTM hyperparameters. Yu [16] used genetic algorithm (GA) to optimizes the LSTM hyperparameters. Du [17] proposed a particle swarm optimization (PSO) for LSTM hyperparameters optimizing. Luo [18] proposed whale optimization algorithm (WOA) to optimize hyperparameters of LSTM. Since optimization algorithms such as PSO, GA, WOA and so on are all prone to falling into local optima, there is still great potential for improving the performance of LSTM based on the improved parameters of these methods [19]. Because Fireworks algorithm (FWA) has global optimization and fast convergence speed, Sun [20] adopted to optimize the LSTM's hyperparameters by FWA. Experiments have shown that compared with LSTM and other hyperparameter optimization methods, FWA-LSTM has better performance in application. 1.2.2 Faulty sensors data diagnosis Currently, research on fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) of HVAC sensors primarily includes Model-based, Rule-based, and Data-driven methods [21,22]. As the complexity of HVAC system increases, implementing model-based and rule-based FDD methods has become challenging. On the other hand, BAS provides practical operationalization of FDD methods based on historical data [23]. Consequently, numerous data-driven based FDD methods for HVAC sensors have been proposed, including neural networks [24,25], feature recognition [26,27], principal component analysis [28] and clustering methods [29,30]. Unfortunately, experiments have shown that the efficiency of a single method is not optimal to diagnose complex system [29]. In subsequent studies, some hybrid methods have been proposed to diagnose HVAC faulty sensors. For instance, an enhanced PCA combined with ensemble empirical mode decomposition is applied for fault detection for chiller sensor [28]. Bai [26] proposes an automatic diagnosis technique for HVAC based on the feature-recognition model and Spectral Regression Kernel Discriminant Analysis (SRKDA). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) combined with a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) was applied for HVAC sensors and actuator fault diagnosis [29]. It has been demonstrated that PCA-GMM has better FDD capability for diagnosing faults in time and low-dimensional data compared to GMM. In Ref. [31], Bayesian network (BN) combined with PCA was proposed to improve detection accuracy in chiller fault diagnosis. Li [31] proposed a novel PCA-density clustering method for chiller sensor fault detection. To sum up, one of the main research approaches for diagnosing faults in hybrid HVAC sensors is to improve the fault diagnosis rate through data feature extraction [32]. 1.3 The gaps of previous research As shown in Fig. 1, based on above analysis, current research still faces limitation in terms of application and methods: 1.3.1 Gaps of application research 1. Faulty sensor in BAS HVAC can lead to data measurement missing and bias, which negatively impact the control stability and accuracy of the HVAC. Unfortunately, the current research only considers the data bias caused by faulty sensor, neglecting the impact of data missing caused by faulty sensor or signal delays caused by BAS HVAC malfunctions on fault diagnosis methods based data-driven. 2. Some data recovery methods based on spatial-temporal relationship that are used for non-faulty HVAC sensor missing data recovery are not applicable in this paper. For instance, when the internet is unstable, it usually causes the loss of data of all sensors in a region rather than a single or a few sensors. This situation prevents data recovery based on the spatial relationship of sensors. Therefore, a new BAS HVAC sensor recovery method that relies only on temporal relationship is required to achieve real-time recovery of missing sensor measurements. 1.3.2 Gaps of current methods research 3. In the review of missing data recovery methods, previous studies have demonstrated that FWA is more suitable for LSTM hyperparameter optimization than conventional hyperparameter optimization methods. However, the lack of effective interaction between conventional FWA results in a larger explosion size, reducing the optimization performance of LSTM hyperparameters. 4. In previous studies, the PCA-based feature extraction methods have applied in fault diagnosis for HVAC sensor. However, PCA is generally suitable for feature extraction of Gaussian distribution [33]. However, the data features of HVAC are non-Gaussian distribution [34]. Therefore, it is necessary to propose a data feature extraction method sensor for non-Gaussian distribution that applies in HVAC faulty sensors diagnosis. 1.4 Contributions of this paper As shown in Fig. 1, this paper addresses the following issues from an application perspective: 1. It takes the Institute of Building Energy at Dalian University of Technology, China as the experimental platform, which simulates the BAS HVAC sensor data missing and fault. Among them, it discusses two situations about sensor data missing in HVAC, which consist of sample rate faulty and sensor measurement losing. Under above background, different types of faulty sensor in BAS HVAC are simulated. 2. To avoid localized sensor data loss caused by BAS malfunctions, it proposes an LSTM-based data recovery method. It relies solely on the temporal relationships between historical data, which resolve the challenge of constructing spatial relationships when multiple sensor data losing. As shown in Fig. 1, in the contribution of current methods, it proposes two novel methods for data recovery and fault diagnosis in the context of incomplete measurement, which is IFWA-LSTM and ICA-KNN. The specific details are as follows: 3. In order to solve the large explosion operator size caused by the lack of interaction between explosion operators in FWA, an improved fireworks algorithm (IFWA)-LSTM method for recovering lost data of BAS HVAC sensor is proposed. Compared with traditional FWA, IFWA increases the interaction between explosion operators and improves the optimization ability of LSTM hyperparameters. 4. Based on the non-Gaussian distribution characteristics of BAS HVAC sensor data, it proposes an independent component analysis (ICA)-K-nearest neighbors (KNN) to diagnose BAS HVAC faulty sensors. 2 Incomplete measurement FDD strategy Conventional data recovery methods typically consider spatial-temporal relationships. However, in BAS HVAC systems, network instability may cause sensor data loss in a particular region rather than failure of a single or few sensors. This situation prevents data recovery based on the spatial relationship of sensors. When recovering incomplete data, the temporal features of the data being recovered should be considered. Therefore, the improved fireworks algorithm (IFWA)-long-short term memory (LSTM) based on the temporal features within incomplete data is proposed in section 2.1. Additionally, FDD methods should consider the distribution characteristics of faulty and non-faulty data. The non-Gaussian distribution patterns of different sensor data in HVAC are considered, and the independent component analysis (ICA)- K-nearest neighbors (KNN) is proposed for detection in section 2.2. 2.1 Incomplete measurement recovering method: IFWA-LSTM 2.1.1 LSTM If a dataset is incomplete, the hidden time series relationship is important for recovering the dataset. LSTM has excellent capabilities for dealing with long-term correlations in time-series data [35]. Therefore, LSTM is chosen as the method for recovering incomplete data for BAS HVAC in this paper. As shown in Fig. 2 , the structure of LSTM contains three gates: the forgetting gate (red part), input gate (blue part), and output gate (purple part) [13]. The input gate is responsible for adding new information to the cell state, while the output gate determines whether to transfer information to the next layer [36]. The forward computation process can be denoted by Equations (1)\u2013(6). (1) f t = σ ( W f ⋅ [ h t − 1 , X t ] + b f ) (2) i t = σ ( W i ⋅ [ h t − 1 , X t ] + b i ) (3) C ˜ t = tanh ( W c ⋅ [ h t − 1 , X t ] + b C ) (4) C t = f t ⋅ C t − 1 + i t ⋅ C ˜ t (5) O t = σ ( W o ⋅ [ C t , h t − 1 , X t ] + b o ) (6) h t = O t * tanh ( C t ) where σ is the sigmoid function, tanh is the tanh function. W f , Wi and Wc are the weight matrices within the LSTM, respectively. b f , b i , b c and b o are the residuals within the LSTM. h t is the state at moment t (default is the current moment) and X t is the input to the state at moment t. It is the output gate output at time t. C t is the cell status values at time t. 2.1.2 IFWA-LSTM The selection of hyperparameters within LSTM is critical to its prediction accuracy [37]. Existing hyperparameters are generally selected by empirical methods, which can be arbitrary and lack universality in their choice of parameters [37]. To reduce the randomness and blindness of parameter selection, multiple hyperparameters are combined into a multi-dimensional solution space, which is traversed to obtain the optimal combination of parameters. The choice of multiple hyperparameters requires better performance optimization algorithms to quickly obtain the global optimum solution over a large solution space [20]. The fireworks algorithm (FWA) is a swarm intelligence optimization algorithm with simple rules and fast convergence [38]. It searches the solution space mainly through sparks generated by fireworks explosions, with the fireworks and explosion sparks forming the entire swarm [39]. The flow of FWA includes initialization, fitness calculation, explosion operator, and explosion operator calculation [40]. As shown in Fig. 3 , FWA consists of explosion operator, mutation operator, mapping rule and selection mechanism. The explosion operator is determined whether it is a local or global search for the optimal solution by the fitness of the fireworks. The mutation operator makes FWA avoid being trapped in a local optimum. The mapping rule is designed to ensure that all fireworks and sparklers appear in the specified search space. The selection mechanism ensures the least adapted fireworks are retained for the next generation, meanwhile, that are identified other fireworks or sparks based on the roulette wheel approach. Because of the lack of effective interaction between traditional FWA, it has resulted in larger blast site sizes. Therefore, it proposed IFWA to improve correlation between blast points. The fitness of the explosion operator shall be bounded by the explosive of sparks number and range size. Among them, the number of explosive sparks s i are as follows: (7) s i = m ⋅ Y max − f ( x i ) + ξ ∑ i = 1 N ( Y max − f ( x i ) ) + ξ f(x i ) is the fitness of each firework x i . m is a constant to regulate the number of sparks. Assuming that the fireworks individual synthesis is N, Y max is the adaptation of the evolution with the greatest adaptation in this generation. ξ is a random minor number to prevent singularities in s i . Each blast range A i is calculated as follows: (8) A i = A \u2032 ⋅ f ( x i ) − Y min + ξ ∑ i = 1 N ( f ( x i ) − Y min ) + ξ Mutation operator is designed to allow FWA to find optimal solutions, meanwhile, avoiding local optima. As shown in E. q (9), a Gaussian mutation is used in this paper. e is a Gaussian distribution. (9) x i \u2032 = x i ⋅ e Y min denotes the fireworks adaptation with the smallest adaptation of this generation, i.e. the best fireworks. However, the range of each blast point in FWA is relatively large, its links between the blast points are small, so it is replaced the optimization-seeking capability of the x j optimization algorithm with a larger blast range by a cross-optimal blast factor x b . a is the crossover probability factor. (10) a = Y max − f ( x j ) Y max − Y min (11) x j \u2032 = a x b + ( 1 − a ) x j After the explosion and the mutation process, the sparks that have been partially washed out of the search space that is remapped into the search space through the mapping rule. Suppose x i ∈ [x u ,x l ], then after x k is flushed out of the search range, one should let x k = x u + rand (0,1)∙(x l -x u ). The selection mechanism of FWA aims to preserve the best-adapted fireworks particles into next generation while using a roulette wheel to determine the probability of the remaining particles remaining. (12) p ( x i ) = d i s t a n c e ( x i ) ∑ j = 1 N d i s t a n c e | x j | where distance (x i ) represents the distance of the particle from each of the remaining particles. In summary, the higher the density of fireworks particles, the lower the probability of those particles being selected; conversely, the lower the density of fireworks particles, the higher the probability of those particles being selected. Results within a small region can be obtained with only a small number of fireworks particles, while flames within a large area are more likely to be retained, ensuring the global search capability of the algorithm [40]. 2.1.3 The computational complexity of IFWA-LSTM The parameters of LSTM can be reduced to two matrices: U and V, which represent input and output mappings, respectively. Assume the dimension of the input layer U is hidden∙input, the dimension of V is hidden∙hidden. Time complexity of hidden and input is O(n), the parameter of hidden is m and the number of parameters of input is n. Then the time complexity of LSTM is O(n) = 4 (mn + n 2 + n). Among them, the number of populations in the IFWA algorithm is N. Time complexity after initialization is O(N). Assuming that the time complexity of the explosion operator and the mutation operator is O(g) and O(s), respectively, then, time complexity of IFWA is O(N + s + g). Finally, the time complexity of IFWA-LSTM after each iteration is O(n) = 4l (mn + n 2 + n). Since the IFWA-LSTM works in situ, its space complexity is O (1). In conclusion, the IFWA algorithm does not increase the time complexity and space complexity of the LSTM. 2.2 FDD model: ICA-KNN The K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) is a Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD) method that detects feature similarities across samples in the feature space based on a training dataset [41]. However, the high dimensionality of samples, strong coupling relationships and poor feature differentiation of measurements resulting from numerous sensors in BAS HVAC can lead to poor FDD capability for KNN [42]. Additionally, the measurement distribution of BAS HVAC systems is non-Gaussian. Independent Component Analysis (ICA) can extract independent characteristic variables from non-Gaussian distributed multivariate measurements [43]. Therefore, this paper proposes an ICA-KNN-based method for FDD in BAS HVAC sensors. Assume that there are d sets of sensor measurements x and t sample points. As shown in equation (13), each set of sample points x i satisfies a set of unknown independent variables s = [s i , 1 , s i , 2 , \u2026, s i , m] (m ≤ d). A is a mixing matrix. (13) x ˜ i = A s i ( A ∈ R d ⋅ m ) The FastICA algorithm is an efficient and popular method for calculating independent components (IC) and the demixing matrix W [43]. It has been widely used for these purposes. In following equation, e i is the residual vector and ŝi is the estimated matrix. (14) s ˆ i = W x ˜ i + e i The initial step in FastICA is whitening, whose purpose is to obtain the maximum non-Gaussianity for each IC [44]. The whitening process is shown in Eqs. (15) and (16). (15 cov ( x ˜ i ) = U Λ U T (16) z i = Λ − 1 2 U x ˜ i = Q x ˜ i where Q is the whitening matrix, which can be obtained by using Eigen-decomposition of the covariance matrix cov(x). Combining equation (12), Eq. (17) can be deduced to give. (17) z i = Q x ˜ i = Q A s i = B s i where B = QA is orthogonal and s i is expressed as follows: (18) s i = B T z i = B T Q x ˜ i Among them, z i and s i are uncertain. It gets W=BT Q combined with Eq. (12)-Eq. (13). The low-dimensional decomposition matrix Wk can be chosen based on the L 2 norm method, then Bk is described as shown: (19) B k = ( W k Q − 1 ) T New sample x ne is taken, then the reconstructed IC s ne can be computed as: (20) s n e = W k x ˜ n e Under the fault detection, the new sample s ne contains potential fault information, i.e. s ne = Wk(x non-fault + x fault ). When HVAC sensors are non-fault, each collection point is Wk x non-fault = 0 [42]. x fault are shown as follows. (21) x ˜ f a u l t = d i r ⋅ α where, dir denotes the direction of the residual vector of faults, α is the magnitude of chiller fault. By using ICA decomposition, the residual vectors corresponding to different faulty conditions are non-collinear and non-correlated. As shown in equation (22), the residual vector R is constructed for fault classification using KNN. (22) R = [ x ˜ n o n − f a u l t , x ˜ f a u l t 1 , x ˜ f a u l t 2 , . . . , x ˜ f a u l t p ] 3 Experimental installation 3.1 The description of BAS As shown in Fig. 4 , BAS HVAC comprises an air handling unit (AHU), chiller, cooling tower and control system. Among them, BAS HVAC control system consists of several layers: field measurement and control layer (FMCL), field bus layer (FBL), area-ctrl layer (ACL), building automatic net layer (BANL), building-Server Layer (BSL), internet layer and cloud layer. The FMCL includes various physical devices located at the building ends, such as sensors, actuators, drives and measuring instruments for each interface. The FMCL converts physical signals at the device's endpoint into digital signals transmitted via the FBL. The FBL serves as the transmission medium between the FMCL and the zone controller layer. The zone controller layer is a crucial component of the BAS-based HVAC system for achieving control operation. The BANL, which serves as the central nerve of the BAS HVAC system, centralizes management of measurement and control equipment within the HVAC by interconnecting controllers used in each zone controller layer. The BSL provides information services for programs installed on servers. The Internet layer is to utilize communication technologies such as networks to connect sensors, controllers, physical devices, and actuators. The cloud layer is a building information network cloud based on cloud storage technology combined with Building Information Modeling (BIM) to manage building information throughout the lifecycle of BAS HVAC. In summary, the operating logic of BAS HVAC is primarily based on interaction between the physical and network layers. This interaction converts physical signals at the physical endpoint into digital signals to realize adaptive operation of HVAC through automatic computer control [35]. 3.2 The description of validation system The building information and HVAC information is shown in Table 1 , respectively. The building height is 4 m, the building area is 160 m2, and the air condition area is 160 m2. The architectural orientation is north-south direction. The heating and cooling mode is central air conditioning system. The window-wall ration is 0.19. As for HVAC, the water source heat pump of heat capacity is 29.5 kW, and input power is 4.8 kW. The water pump of rated flow is 2.7 m3/h, and that of delivery lift is 12 mH2O. The nominal air flow rate of AHU is 5000 m3/h, and input power is 1.92 kW. As shown in Fig. 5 , the return air system mixes air in the required proportion through the air baffle of the return and fresh air. The mixed air is transported to the room through filters, humidifiers, and heat exchangers via fresh air ducts [45]. Filters are used to remove dust from the air. In winter conditions, the heat exchanger raises the supply air temperature through heat exchange between hot water and air. In summer conditions, the air temperature is lowered through heat exchange between air and chilled water. To ensure that room temperature, relative humidity, and CO2 concentration meet set values, it is necessary to adjust the fresh air volume, temperature, and relative humidity value in real-time to maintain dynamic stability of the indoor environment. Therefore, various types of sensors are installed in the AHU to collect physical values such as temperature, humidity, pressure, differential pressure, and CO2 concentration to monitor the real-time operation of the AHU. The chiller comprises an evaporator, condenser, compressor, and other components. The transmission medium is refrigerant and water. In summer conditions, the refrigerant enters the compressor after completing heat exchange through the evaporator, converting it into a high-temperature and high-pressure vapor form. The refrigerant then passes through the condenser to complete heat exchange with the cooling medium, turning it into a liquid state to complete the next cycle of cooling the surrounding environment [46]. In winter conditions, the circulation path is reversed from that of summer conditions. 3.3 The control loop of HVAC The PID controller controls the actuators of HVAC to adjust supply air volume and temperature at its set value. The relevant parameters of PID algorithm are shown in Table 2 . Air supply temperature and volume are the primary means of regulating indoor environmental comfort using HVAC. As shown in Fig. 6 (a), room temperature and humidity are dynamically balanced by adjusting the opening of the air supply valve. As shown in Fig. 6(b), during the air supply process, the return air damper at the return air duct is adjusted according to outdoor temperature and pump power to reach the set air supply temperature. The set values of room temperature, humidity, and CO2 concentration are met through combined regulation of air supply volume and temperature. 3.4 The process of measurement collection In previous research, the operation of HVAC systems under summer conditions has typically been considered, neglecting their operation under winter conditions. Therefore, this paper focuses on winter conditions. A total of 10 days of data were collected from January 3 to January 13, 2022, at the Institute of Building Energy at Dalian University of Technology, China. Data were collected at 1-min intervals, resulting in 14,190 sets of data. To simulate the normal operation of the HVAC system, the start time was set from 9:00 to 21:45 and the shutdown time from 21:45 to 9:00 the following day. During the shutdown period, the BAS HVAC system stopped heating, but the sensor network continued to monitor measurements. In this study, only the operation data of the HVAC system is considered. The collection data consist of transient data and steady-state data. The collection data is used to filter the transient data by moving window statistical method in this paper [47]. Tables 3 and 4 show information on sensor measurements in the AHU and chiller, respectively. The temperature sensors are resistance sensors with an accuracy tolerance of ±0.1 °C. The differential pressure sensor, pressure sensor, and humidity sensor are capacitive sensors. The accuracy tolerance of the differential pressure sensor is ±0.05 %, that of the pressure sensor is ±0.075 %, and that of the humidity sensor is ±1 %. The water flow sensor is an ultrasonic flow sensor with an accuracy tolerance of ±1.0 %. The CO2 sensor is an infrared ray sensor with an accuracy tolerance of ±3 %. Due to different measuring objects in BAS HVAC sensors, their measuring range, precision, and principle also vary. As a result, sensitivity to faults varies from sensor to sensor, leading to widely varying efficiency when using the same FDD method to diagnose different fault sensors. 4 Validation simulation and investigation 4.1 Investigation of incomplete measurement Typically, the data-driven FDD approach is based on a dataset consisting of a network of sensors within the FMCL of the HVAC system [5]. If data from the sensor network are unreliable or missing, the data-driven FDD approach may experience errors or training failures. Incomplete sensor measurements usually result from human settings or mechanical faults [48]. Fig. 7 provides an example (Temperature of evaporator inlet) of causes of incomplete data in an actual HVAC system: 1) Data may be incomplete due to inadequate sampling rate settings in the initial sensor design. For example, to prolong battery life, numerous sensor measurements for duct pressure, duct air humidity and temperature are purposely reduced according to the measurement protocol [49]. Similarly, Ref [49] points out that wireless sensors are installed in BAS in smart buildings. These wireless sensors are connected via the internet, and when the network is unstable, it can result in the loss of sensor measurement data. In this research, wireless sensors are not used in BAS HVAC. Such low-frequency sensor measurements are also considered \u201cincomplete.\u201d In Fig. 7 (Red part), the initial measurement interval of the sensor is 1 min. It simulates the actual measurement interval of sensor is 1.25 min. 2) Sensor aging can lead to missing data, meanwhile, sensor data are most likely influenced by bias or drift faults. The rate of incomplete data and degree of fault may gradually increase, even resulting in complete failure as operating time progresses. Additionally, disconnections or faults in the BAS system can also cause data loss. Fig. 7 (blue part) simulates 20 % data loss in sensor measurements. Regardless of whether a sensor has already failed, incomplete sensor data can cause the data frequency to be out of sync with the HVAC control frequency, resulting in reduced control accuracy. Therefore, to ensure proper operation of BAS HVAC, it is essential to construct a complete measurement set before performing FDD. 4.2 Validation simulation 4.2.1 The simulation of incomplete measurement As shown in Table 5 , the experiment simulated two scenarios of incomplete measurement: 1) The incorrect sample rate settings, 2) The sensor measurements losing. Incorrect sample rate settings can occur due to factors such as sampling frequency setting faults, extending sensor or battery life, etc. The theoretical setting for the sensor sample collection frequency is 1min/time but the actual frequency is 3min/time, this can cause incomplete data. Unlike sensor or BAS faults, such incomplete measurements are usually distributed in a regular pattern. In this research, it discusses the performance of differential pressure sensors (#2), temperature sensors (#7, #15), and flow sensors (#17) in IFWA-LSTM and compared methods. Unlike incorrect sample rate settings, the manifestation of data loss is usually randomly distributed. For instance, network disconnection caused by fault of BAS may result loss of several consecutive measurements over a period time. Theoretically, previous data is recovered based on recovery method, the error in its recovery will lead to a greater error in the next recovered measurement. That would result in a vicious circle. As shown in Table 5, the sensor of Differential pressure of condenser water (#19), Humidity of fresh air (#8) and Temperature of return air (#11) is researched for sensor measurement losing recovery. 4.2.2 The simulation of faulty measurement In experiment, non-faulty sensors are placed in the BAS-HVAC. These sensors are connected to FMCL via data cables. In FMCL, the sensor signals are converted from RS-485 to RS-485 signals. Then, that is transmitted to the upper computer operating platform in ACL. Sensor faults are added to the corresponding sensor data via the upper computer operating platform to simulate sensor faults. Referring to previous studies [28,47], it has been proven that simulating faulty sensor measurement data by introducing fault deviations is a feasible approach for fault detection. Therefore, it is possible to clearly understand the health status of each data point and record the corresponding fault locations and degree. We study fresh air temperature sensors (#7), supply air differential pressure sensors (#2), and fresh air humidity sensors (#8) for fault diagnosis of BAS HVAC sensors with the fault settings shown in Table 6 . These sensors are located in the AHU and chiller within the HVAC, which have strong similarities to sensors at other points, such as units, working environment, measurement distribution, and sensor structure. One sensor site with a high recovery fit and two sensor sites with low recovery fits were selected to ensure the adequacy of experimental research. Therefore, these sensors are studied in this section. Compared to other sensors in HVAC, ultrasound-based water flow sensors have a much longer service life, so their faults are not considered in this section. The training data for all FDD methods are derived from the full measurements of sensors, which is more in line with practical engineering needs. 4.3 The flowchart of validation With Institute of Building Energy in Dalian University of Technology measurement data, IFWA-LSTM is applied to reconstruct in the first step. The incomplete HVAC sensor data contains both non-fault and fault data. That will recover the incomplete data of HVAC sensors to simulate the real missing data state, which is marked with \u201cInf\u201d (Fig. 7 of the respective test). IFWA-LSTM is used to recover incomplete data. The reconstructed training data were placed in a temporal state (the actual FDD context), with 70 % of the sensor data (9933 sets) used for training and the remaining 30 % (4257 sets) used for testing. The recovered sensor data were fed back into the BANL and cloud layer via the BAS-based HVAC for data control and storage, respectively. As shown in Fig. 8 , the trained IFWA-LSTM is plugged into each ACL to monitor whether the acquisition frequency of sensor measurements meets the set frequency for the HVAC system. If measurements are missing, the missing point is set to \u2018Inf\u2019 and then recovered through IFWA-LSTM to replace \u2018Inf\u2019. The recovered measurements are inputted into BANL to complete the control operation. Afterward, the recovered measurements are stored in the Cloudy Layer via internet layer (IL). ICA-KNN is the offline method to detect sensor faults, which checks the health state of the sensor using ICA-KNN within a period of time set by the frequency. Faulty sensors can decrease indoor thermal comfort and result in additional energy consumption. Detecting faulty sensors in HVAC systems as early as possible can effectively prevent the negative impacts caused by the aforementioned issues. IFWA-LSTM and ICA-KNN do not intervene in the control process of the BAS HVAC system. They function more like \u201cprobes\u201d that are used to recover and detect missing or faulty sensor measurements. 5 Result analysis and discussion Due to the BAS HVAC sensor are few existing studies on FDD based in incomplete measurements, it applies extreme learning machine (ELM)-based [49], random forest (RF)-based [50] and FWA-LSTM as experimental comparisons methods, above that are applied in related studies. Incomplete data will be simulated real possible conditions, which are all encountered during the actual experiments. In future research, the unknown and possible alternative types of incomplete measurements in BAS HVAC sensors will be continued to investigate. The FDD process was compared with EMD-PCA [51], ELM-KNN [42] and KNN-based methods, respectively. 5.1 Analysis of IFWA-LSTM parameters chosen To ensure optimal optimization capability for IFWA-LSTM under incomplete measurements, hyperparameter optimization was selected. The fireworks population number for IFWA is generally set between 5 and 35 and the D variable dimensionality is 2, in order to balance the optimization effect of the initial hyperparameters against computation time [40]. Therefore, the number of fireworks populations was set to 20 and the dimension of the D variable was set to 2. The correlation between the input and output parameters of IFWA-LSTM is important for recovering incomplete measurements. Table 7 analyzes the input parameter correlation of each type of HVAC sensor using the Pearson coefficient. The sensor types include temperature sensors (Tr, TEI, TCO), differential pressure sensors (DS), pressure sensors (PS), CO2 concentration sensors (CS), humidity sensors (HS), and flow sensors (FWC). In order to better observe the correlation between different sensor data in terms of their temporal sequence, the sensor data selected for the experiment are all non-faulty data. In Table 7, \u20181\u2019 represents the correlation between the sensor signal collected at the previous moment and the current moment. In experiments, it was found that the input parameters of LSTM have a probability gradient explosion when their number is greater than 11. Therefore, only the interval [1,11] is discussed in Table 7. For most sensors with less than \u20185\u2019, the average temporal correlation is greater. This study unifies the input parameters of IFWA-LSTM as 5. In winter conditions, the HVAC system typically regulates the supply of air static pressure and cooling water flow to meet heating standards. As shown in Table 7, the correlation of cooling water is low while that of supply air pressure is high. This is because air supply static pressure control is a stage adjustment. When the static pressure is less than or equal to 20Pa, the valve opens to 30 %; when the static pressure is between 20Pa and 30Pa, the valve opens to 70 %; when the static pressure is between 30Pa and 40Pa, the valve opens to 90 %; and when the static pressure is greater than 40Pa, the valve opens to 100 %. As a result, the supply air static pressure, which is less affected by control regulation, has a higher correlation. 5.2 Result analysis of incomplete measurements recovering The method for recovering incomplete data in BAS HVAC sensors uses diversion and correlation to evaluate recovery performance. Diversion evaluates the degree of bias between the recovered and true sensor measurements; the smaller the diversion, the higher the approximation. Correlation assesses whether the recovered measurement accurately fits the pattern of the sensor's measured distribution [52]. The distribution of sensor measurements is an important reference indicator for assessing the health state of sensors under control strategies for BAS HVAC. The higher the correlation value, the better the fit of the recovery method to the true sensor distribution. As shown in Table 8 , the ideal correlation should be 1 while the ideal diversion should be 0. Due to the numerous sensors within BAS HVAC, each type has been selected for comparison between different methods as shown in Tables 9 and 10 , respectively. In discussing validation results, correlation verifies the fit of recovered data while diversion verifies the accuracy of recovered data. 5.2.1 The validation result in incorrect sample rate settings As the damper opening of the supply air is controlled in stages, which is constant over some time. The differential pressure of supply air is stable with small variations and strong temporal relationships. Therefore, as shown in Fig. 9 (A), the IFWA-LSTM has the smallest diversion among the #2 sensor faults, while the correlation is 0.9899. Compared with comparison methods, IFWA-LSTM has the best recovery accuracy and fit. IFWA-LSTM can better recover the sensor missing data of the differential pressure of supply air, ensuring accurate response to adjust the AHU supply air volume control strategy in HVAC systems. From methodological perspective, correlation of the condenser inlet temperature (#13) sensor reached 0.9216, which demonstrates IFWA-LSTM more fit incomplete measurements, compared with other methods. In Fig. 9(C), compared to FWA, optimization of the initial hyperparameters of the LSTM by IFWA improves correlation by 0.0319 and decreases the diversion by 2.26. It is demonstrated that by improving the initial hyperparameters of the LSTM, the recovery accuracy and fit of the LSTM can be improved in incomplete measurements. The prediction principle of IFWA-LSTM is based on using historical data to interpolate the current operating status data. However, the frequent regulation of chilled water pump control by BANL of BAS weakens the temporal relationships of sensor data. Additionally, ultrasonic flow sensors are susceptible to interference from bubble voids within the fluid, pipe dirt, and other sound sources, resulting in strong noise and poor temporal relationships. As shown in Table 9, the recovery fit of IFWA-LSTM is 0.6340, which is higher than compared methods. The recovery accuracy of IFWA-LSTM is 0.09; however, its data distribution is only in the range [1.9,2.3]. In summary, the accuracy of IFWA-LSTM is not high for condenser water flow under winter conditions. Similarly, the temporal relationship of fresh air temperature (#7) is weaker due to large random factors from the external environment. As shown in Fig. 9(B), the recovery fit for fresh air temperature is 0.4452. 5.2.2 The validation result in data loss Table 10 focuses on the data recovery capability of IFWA-LSTM and compared methods in case of data loss due to sensor or BAS fault and disconnection. Unlike incorrect sample rate settings, the manifestation of data loss is usually randomly distributed. For instance, network disconnection caused by fault of BAS may result loss of several consecutive measurements over a period time. Theoretically, previous data is recovered based on recovery method, the error in its recovery will lead to a greater error in the next recovered measurement. That would result in a vicious circle. The accuracy of the condenser water flow differential pressure sensor is affected by the characteristics of the fluid. For example, if there are air bubbles, particles, or contaminants such as dirt in the condenser, they may interfere with the normal flow of water, resulting in inaccurate measurement of the pressure differential by the sensor. Therefore, similar to the data recovery performance of the flow sensor of condenser water, the recovery accuracy of the condenser water pressure differential sensor is also low. As shown in Fig. 10 (E), the recovery accuracy (0.16) and fit (0.3877) of Differential pressure of condenser water sensor #19. As shown in Fig. 10(F), recovery accuracy and fit of IFWA-LSTM for fresh air humidity (#8) is poor. The recovery accuracy is 1.12 and the recovery fit is 0.4520. The reason for above condition is that is disturbed by external environment. The recovery fit of sensor of humidity of fresh air (#8) and temperature of fresh air (#7) is similar because of similarity of detection sites. The correlation of IFWA-LSTM is 0.4520 in #8, and that is 0.4452 in #7. IFWA-LSTM has great recovery accuracy and fit compared to the other compared methods. Fig. 10(G) discusses the recovery accuracy and fit of return air temperature sensor (#11) undermeasurements loss. When HVAC operation enters a steady state, which is a minor variation in room temperature and a strong temporal-relationship. Therefore, the correlation between IFWA-LSTM and the other compared methods all reached above 0.90. Among them, IFWA-LSTM has a great correlation of 0.9685. Data distribution of temperature of return air is over the range [20,28] with a sensor detection accuracy of ±0.1 °C. Therefore, diversion of ±0.25 °C is negligible in FDD. However, the recovery accuracy of 0.25 still needs to be improved in control loop. 5.3 Result analysis of faulty measurements FDD 5.3.1 The analysis of FDD capabilities in fresh air temperature sensor Fig. 11 demonstrates the FDD capability of ICA-KNN versus comparison methods in a bias fault degree at 4 °C in the fresh air temperature sensor. In full measurements, the detection rate of ICA-KNN is 99.59 %, which is an improvement of 0.59 % and 3.25 %, respectively, compared to the other methods. Among them, ELM-KNN has the best detection rate of 100 %. ICA-KNN, KNN, and ELM-KNN all have a detection rate of 99.00 % or more. The fault alarm rate for ICA-KNN with full measurements is negligible at 0.01 %. The detection rate of ICA-KNN in incomplete data based on IFWA-LSTM recovery is 76.90 %. Compared to full measurements, the diagnosis rate of recovery measurement decreased by 22.69 %, while the false alarm rate increased by 2.45 %. This is due to the decrease in measurement accuracy and correlation caused by IFWA-LSTM based recovery data. In comparison with comparative methods, the detection efficiency of ICA-KNN improved by 7.94%\u201321.86 % compared to other FDD methods. In an analysis of fault alarm rate, there is a 6.18 % decrease compared to the KNN fault alarm rate (8.64 %). It demonstrates the negative impact of reduced accuracy in recovery measurement, which can be mitigated by feature extraction of the data. 5.3.2 The analysis of FDD capabilities in supply air differential pressure sensor As shown in Fig. 12 , ICA-KNN has the best FDD capability in both full measurements and incomplete measurements based on IFWA-LSTM recovery. Compared to KNN, the detection rate of ICA-KNN is improved by 4.41 % in incomplete measurements based on IFWA-LSTM recovery. It demonstrates that ICA can weaken the negative impact produced by IFWA-LSTM in recovering data. The lower fault alarm rate of KNN compared to other methods proves that KNN is more suitable as an FDD method for HVAC compared to EMD-PCA. As shown in Table 10, the fit of recovered measurements under #2 is high (correlation), but the accuracy (diversion) is poor. The detection rate and false alarm rate of the FDD method are both superior to fault #7 and #8. It proves that the fit of measurement is more important to the FDD capability than the recovery accuracy. 5.3.3 The analysis of FDD capabilities in fresh air humidity sensor As shown in Table 10, fault #8 is set to a 10 % bias fault in the experiment, which is much higher than the fault levels in sections 4.3.1 and 4.3.2. Thus, as shown in Fig. 13 , FDD methods have a higher detection rate than similarly correlated #7 with the IFWA-LSTM recovered data. The detection rate for ICA-KNN is 99.65 %, a decrease of only 0.35 % compared to full measurements. The ICA-KNN has the best detection and fault alarm rates compared to comparison methods. Among them, the diagnostic rate improved by 0.71%\u201346.75 % and the false alarm rate decreased by 0.20%\u20139.68 % under full measurements. In incomplete measurements based on IFWA-LSTM recovery, the detection rate improved by 6.46%\u201355.76 % and the fault alarm rate decreased by 0.20%\u20138.69 %. 5.3.4 Overall diagnostic performance of four methods Table 11 concludes the overall performance of the four methods. The overall performance is introduced to evaluate the mean diagnostic rate and fault alarm rate under full measurement and incomplete measurement recovered by IFWA-LSTM. The mean diagnostic rate of the ICA-KNN, KNN and ELM-KNN [42] is approximately 99 %. It evaluates that KNN-based methods are more suitable to detect HVAC sensor faults compared with EMD-PCA. The high fault alarm rate indicates that the diagnostic rate of FDD methods have high uncertainty. Among them, the mean fault alarm rate of ICA-KNN is approximately 0 %. It evaluates ICA-KNN has the highest reliability for HVAC faulty sensor detection under full measurement. However, due to the limitations in the recovery accuracy of IFWA-LSTM, overall FDD methods in validation have been negatively impact in result of fault diagnostic rate and fault alarm rate. Compared to full measurement, ICA-KNN has a 7.68 % decrease in diagnostic rate and a 1.22 % increase in fault alarm rate under incomplete measurement by IFWA-LSTM recovery. And the fault diagnostic rate decreasing of KNN, ELM-KNN and EMD-PCA is 13.49 %, 21.50 % and 12.79 %, respectively. The fault alarm rate increasing of KNN, ELM-KNN and EMD-PCA is 5.53 %, 0.30 % and 0.09 %. Although ELM-KNN has lower fault alarm rate than ICA-KNN, its fault diagnostic rate is significantly lower than that of ICA-KNN. To sum up, ICA-KNN exhibits superior diagnostic capability under full and incomplete measurements recovered by IFWA-LSTM. 5.4 Limitations This paper fills a research gap in sensor FDD in incomplete measurements recovering of BAS HVAC. However, this research still has the following shortcomings: IFWA-LSTM has higher prediction accuracy and fitness compared to other sensor measurement missing recovery methods. However, IFWA-LSTM has lower prediction accuracy and fitness in missing data recovery from poor correlation or controlled point sensors, which still cannot meet engineering needs with higher accuracy. In subsequent studies, the research of missing measurements recovery and its FDD methods should be focused on low BAS HVAC timing correlations and controlled point sensors. In addition, ICA-KNN has a poor FDD efficiency of 76.90 % in the recovery measurements of the fault with a low correlation (correlation of #7 Fresh air temperature sensor is 0.4452, which is the strength of the correlation) with a small degree of fault. The practicality of ICA-KNN is limited in the above sensor points. Finally, this study discusses that the types and degree of faulty sensors are not sufficient. 6 Conclusion As BAS demands more and more accuracy from the monitoring measurements of HVAC systems, BAS often has missing and incorrect data due to system or sensor settings and faults. Therefore, this paper investigates FDD in BAS HVAC based on incomplete sensor measurement data that proposes the IFWA-LSTM sensor missing measurements recovery method and the ICA-KNN FDD method. The conclusions are as follows: 1) It discusses the optimal number of input values to be selected for the IFWA-LSTM, which provides a reference for practical engineering applications. The reliability of the BAS HVAC is verified by the Institute of Building Energy at Dalian University of Technology. 2) From an overall performance, compared to comparison methods, IFWA-LSTM has better prediction accuracy and fitness under different sensor measurement frequency setting faults or sensor faults, with an improvement of 0.01 (11.11 %) to 2.26 (86.92 %) in recovery accuracy and 0.0189 (1.91 %) to 0.6340 (63.40 %) in fitness. The experiment demonstrated that among the incomplete data recovery of the supply air pressure differential sensor, condenser inlet temperature sensor, and return air temperature sensor, IFWA-LSTM achieved the high recovery accuracy. The correlation coefficients reached 0.9899, 0.9876, and 0.968, respectively. However, due to internal system interference, external environmental noise, and sensor accuracy, the incomplete data recovery of the outdoor air humidity sensor, condenser pressure differential sensor, and condenser water flow rate sensor yielded low recovery accuracy using IFWA-LSTM. The correlation coefficients were 0.4452, 0.3877, and 0.6340, respectively. 3) ICA-KNN is proposed for FDD of sensors in BAS HVAC, which is formed from incomplete measurements recovered based on IFWA-LSTM. It compares the FDD capability of ICA-KNN in raw measurement data and sensor incomplete measurement data based on IFWA-LSTM, respectively. It demonstrates that feature extraction of data by ICA can improve the FDD capability of KNN. ICA-KNN improves fault diagnosis rates by 0.41%\u201368.90 % and reduces false alarm rates by 0.08%\u20139.70 % compared to the comparative FDD method in different sensors from BAS HVAC. Due to the limitations in the recovery accuracy of IFWA-LSTM, overall FDD methods in validation have been negatively impact in result of fault diagnostic rate and fault alarm rate. To sum up, the experimental comparison shows that the correlation of the recovered measurements has a greater impact on the efficiency of the FDD than the accuracy of its recovery in incomplete measurements-based FDD after measurements recovery.

        "dc:description": "Due to the development of sensor networks, Building Automation System (BAS) based heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) has gradually replaced traditional HVAC to improve indoor thermal comfort and decrease energy consumption. Because of inevitable faults in sensors or networks, the real-time sensor data may be incomplete with corrupted, lost or undetected missing values. Therefore, Improved Fireworks Algorithm (IFWA)-Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is proposed to recover incomplete measurements in BAS HVAC sensors. Because sensor data loss mostly results from incorrect control commands from the BAS system or sensor damage, there is a high probability of concurrent sensor fault. Therefore, Independent Component Analysis (ICA)-K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is proposed to monitor the sensor's healthy state under the measurements recovered. This paper discusses the possible causes of incomplete measurement in BAS HVAC sensors and simulates the distribution by experiment. The experiment analyzes the data recovery capability of IFWA-LSTM for different types of missing sensor data in different sensor measurement loss scenarios. The result shows that compared to the comparative methods, IFWA-LSTM achieves a 6.45 %\u201386.92 % improvement in recovery accuracy and a 0.0041 to 0.6340 improvement in correlation coefficients. Subsequently, it discusses the fault diagnosis rate of ICA-KNN under full measurements and incomplete measurement recovered by IFWA-LSTM. Overall, ICA-KNN achieves an average fault diagnosis rate of 99.86 % and an average fault alarm rate of 0 % under full measurement. When applied to incomplete measurement recovered by IFWA-LSTM, ICA-KNN exhibits an average fault diagnosis rate of 92.18 % and an average fault alarm rate of 1.22 %.",
