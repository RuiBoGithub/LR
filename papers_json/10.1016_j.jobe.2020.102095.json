State Key Laboratory of Green Building in Western China Xi'an 710055 China It is difficult to prompt students to take energy saving behaviors proactively owing to their limited responsibilities for energy saving; thus, administrators are required to actively adopt management means to reduce building energy consumption. Reasonable arrangement of course timetables by administrators can greatly promote energy efficiency in university buildings, as the energy consumption of teaching buildings is closely related to factors such as occupancy time and number of users. Hence, this study develops a co-simulation method based on the Building Controls Virtual Test Bed (BCVTB) platform using genetic algorithm to optimize university timetable considering building energy efficiency. The timetable of a university teaching building in Xi'an, China, from September 2019 to January 2020, is simulated using the proposed method. According to the simulation results, the occupancy of classrooms in the optimized timetable is relatively concentrated timewise. As more courses are allocated in the afternoon, the operating time of lighting during the daytime would decrease accordingly. Therefore, the lighting power consumption is reduced. In addition, the cooling load of the teaching building is increased and the heating load of the teaching building decreases. The results indicate that the utilization of the proposed course timetabling method can reduce the energy consumption of teaching buildings by approximately 3.6% in the autumn semester. The developed method helps administrators arrange a timetable to achieve energy efficiency in university buildings. Moreover, it is helpful for the design and operation management of teaching buildings.

According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, building energy consumption, especially university building energy consumption, accounts for a large portion of the global total energy consumption [1,2]. Research shows that in the United States, the energy consumption of university buildings accounts for 13% of the total building energy consumption, ranking fourth after retail buildings, office buildings, hotels, and restaurants [3]. As a result, universities have to bear the high cost of energy consumption, which has become the second highest cost of many universities across the world [4]. In universities, teaching buildings are one of the most important venues for teachers and students. Owing to the high usage frequency and occupancy density, the energy consumption of teaching buildings is generally high. Therefore, reducing the energy consumption of university teaching buildings is an urgent goal. Basically, two approaches can be used to conserve energy in university buildings. The first approach is the technical solution, such as improving the efficiency of energy-consuming equipment. The second approach is the management solution, such as optimizing the operation of energy-consuming equipment [5,6]. Generally, the management solution is often preferred over the technical solution because it is more economical and practical. In universities, the energy use behaviors of students have great impacts on the energy consumption of the teaching building; therefore, energy saving management for students is essential in achieving the energy saving goals of universities. However, as students do not bear the energy costs of teaching buildings, students lack enthusiasm in practicing energy saving behaviors. Therefore, it is necessary for administrators to mandate management solutions. As the schedule of room occupancy has an important impact on building energy consumption [7,8], a reasonable arrangement of course timetables by administrators can greatly influence energy conservation in university teaching buildings [9]. Therefore, optimizing timetables from the perspective of energy efficiency has received attention in recent years. Relevant research can be divided into calculating building energy consumptions and creating university course timetables. Representative studies are reviewed in Sections 1.1 and 1.2, respectively. 1.1 Building energy consumption calculation The key to establishing an optimization model for university course timetables, which aims at reducing energy consumption, is to accurately calculate building energy consumption. Commonly used methods to calculate building energy consumption include white-, black-, and gray-box models. The white-box model uses a transparent process based on physics equations to describe the energy behavior of buildings [10]. The black-box model mainly relies on time-series statistical analyses and machine learning algorithms to assess and forecast building energy consumption [10]; thus, black-box models are also called data-driven models. The gray-box model, which is a combination of the white- and black-box methods, overcomes some disadvantages of both methods [11]. Compared with the simplified method, which only depends on the unit power rating and operating hours collected from a field survey, the white-, black-, and gray-box models, which require more detailed information about external (e.g., weather) and internal properties (e.g., building characteristics), calculate building energy consumption with higher accuracy [5]. Occupancy is crucial for determining building energy consumption [12]. Currently, building occupancy profiles have been widely used in building energy consumption prediction. For example, Carlucci et al. [13] examined the effects of stochastically generated occupancy schedules on the energy performance of a multi-residential high-rise building located in Shanghai, China. Simulation outcomes showed that temporal and spatial randomness of occupancy and occupancy-dependent schedules had statistically significant influences on the building's energy performance. However, few studies have been conducted to optimize the occupancy profiles to achieve building energy efficiency. Due to the influence of seasons and weather, the energy consumption of the building is different during different occupancy periods [14]. Therefore, optimizing the occupancy schedule of the room can contribute to achieving further energy savings. For example, Yuan et al. [15] proposed a room scheduling algorithm to minimize the energy required to re-cool meeting rooms. Compared with the actual schedule, high energy conservation was observed in schedules drawn by rearranging occupancy schedules for the rooms. In addition, proper room allocation is essential for reducing energy consumption, owing to the relationship between room size and heating (cooling) loads [5]. To achieve an acceptable thermal comfort level in a large room, more heating and cooling energy are used than in a small room. Zheng et al. [8] presented an approach for reassigning rooms to unify the start/stop schedule of the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system at the zone level by placing occupants with similar profiles in the same mechanical zones. When room reassignment was implemented and coupled with a profile-based control schedule, the energy consumption of HVAC was reduced by 8%. However, there have been few attempts that simultaneously consider the impact of temporal (e.g., occupied time period of the day) and spatial factors (e.g., occupancy combination of classrooms with different capacities) on classroom energy consumption; thus, it is an issue yet to be explored. 1.2 University course timetabling The interest in this research area is due to the International Timetabling Competitions (ITC) organized on this topic. The first ITC was organized in 2002 by Paechter and Gambardella of the European Metaheuristics Network and was sponsored by PATAT [16]. A large amount of research has been published after the success of the ITC [17\u201319]. In the beginning, the objective of course timetabling optimization was to minimize the weighted sum of multiple objective functions to represent the costs of the violation of soft constraints [16]. In recent years, researchers have focused on specific aspects of the timetable to make the problem more practical. Vermuyten et al. [20] solved the congestion problem in elevators and stairwells of university buildings by minimizing student flow and creating a compact timetable. Akkan and Gulcu [21] focused on the robustness of the course timetable, that is, late changes should be incorporated in the current timetable by making minimal modifications. They obtained a set of good solutions in terms of both penalty and robustness values. Yasari et al. [22] ideally arranged course timetables while considering course cancelation risks and possible changes that may occur after the registration period; ultimately, the undesirability was minimized in the final timetable. However, none of the above studies considered building energy consumption when creating course timetables. Sethanan et al. [23] solved the timetable problem of a Thai university over the academic years from 2006 to 2012. They improved the energy efficiency of the university by scheduling the occupancy of classrooms and demonstrated that a relative improvement of 7.12\u201328.59% could be achieved by the ClassTabu algorithm compared with the previous timetable. However, this research adopted several assumptions in the calculation of energy consumption to simplify the problem. Song et al. [5] proposed an energy-efficiency-based course timetabling algorithm that identified a timetable that ensured optimal energy use. The experimental results indicated that the optimal timetable led to a 4.0% energy reduction compared with the previous timetable, and energy savings of up to 5.0% were achieved by mitigating hard constraints. This research mainly considers the distribution of courses in different functional and scale spaces, but fails to explore the arrangement of courses in different time periods. Jafarinejad et al. [12] proposed an optimization method based on a bi-level energy-efficient occupancy profile, which was integrated into a demand-driven control strategy adjusted to optimize the energy consumption within the university department building. According to the results, an energy saving of 1.2% was achieved based on the optimized timetable. Upon integration of a demand-driven control scheme, the optimization could achieve energy savings of more than 18.97%. However, this research only considers seven classrooms of the same scale and a small number of teachers and courses; thus, the complexity and diversity of teaching resources in an actual course arrangement are not considered. In general, few specific and comprehensive studies have been conducted on optimizing course timetabling from the perspective of building energy efficiency. Therefore, the problem of course timetabling optimization still needs to be studied. University course timetabling problems are known to be non-deterministic polynomial complete, as the search space for possible solutions grows exponentially with the number of events [24]. The traditional method to obtain a feasible solution, which is manual calculation, requires a lot of manual labor and time. Moreover, it is difficult to update the timetable if the constraints change. Thus, researchers have begun to explore methods using mathematical programming. For example, Bagger et al. [19] proposed a Benders\u2019 decomposition on a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model for a curriculum-based course timetabling problem, but this method is difficult to deal with the non-linearity and non-convexity of the problem [25]. In recent years, heuristic algorithms, which can address complex non-linearity optimization problems, have been introduced for course timetabling optimization. Commonly used heuristic algorithms include the genetic algorithm (GA) [21,26,27], tabu search (TS) [28], simulated annealing (SA) [27], particle swarm optimization (PSO) [29], bee mating [30], and hybrid algorithms [31\u201333]. Khonggamnerd and Innet [34] used GA to establish a university course timetabling and proved that a feasible solution could be obtained without violating hard constraints. Goh et al. [35] used TS with sampling and perturbation (TSSP) to generate feasible course timetabling solutions. TSSP managed to find 100% feasibility for all Socha, ITC-2002, and ITC-2007 instances in a relatively short time compared with existing methods reported in literature. Hossain et al. [29] proposed a PSO-based innovative method to solve university course timetabling problems. The results revealed the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method compared with traditional methods. Kohshori et al. [36] proposed a multi-group hybrid GA that combined local search, SA, TS, and fuzzy search methods to solve the university course timetabling problem. Experimental results indicated that the proposed GA produced promising results in large instances of timetabling problems. Since the energy consumption of buildings is affected by many factors (e.g., season, weather, time of day, and number of occupants) during the occupation period, the energy consumption of classrooms varies during different occupation periods. The relationship between building energy consumption and occupancy timetables is difficult to be described using a linear function. Thus, MILP is not applicable in this study. Compared with MILP, heuristic algorithms can effectively solve complex non-linearity optimization problems and have huge advantages in search efficiency. Therefore, the heuristic algorithm is utilized for solving the problem of optimizing university courses timetabling considering building energy efficiency in this study. 1.3 Research objectives This research aims to optimize a university's course timetable to reduce the energy consumption of teaching buildings. There has been significant research regarding building energy consumption calculation and course timetable optimization. However, existing research methods cannot be directly applied to the optimization of university timetables for energy efficiency. Although a few scholars have used empirical formulas to calculate the energy consumption of teaching buildings in the optimization of course timetabling [5,23], the roughness of empirical formulas leads to unsatisfactory optimization results. EnergyPlus [37] can be used to simulate and calculate the energy consumption of teaching buildings to improve the calculation accuracy. However, to enable the simultaneous implementation of both calculating energy consumption of the building and optimizing the course timetable, it is necessary to combine the two simulation programs. The Building Controls Virtual Test Bed (BCVTB) platform [38] can be used to connect EnergyPlus and other simulation software (e.g., Matlab [39]) [40]. As the connection interfaces are different, a co-simulation method should be developed based on the BCVTB platform according to the characteristics of the problem. Therefore, the three objectives of this research can be formulated as follows: ● establishing a co-simulation model based on the BCVTB platform that can enable simultaneous simulation of building energy consumption and optimization of the course timetable; ● creating an optimal course timetable for the university to minimize energy consumption of the teaching building; ● investigating the impact of the course timetable on energy consumption of the teaching buildings. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes related research methods. Section 3 provides the results and discussion of the course arrangement and energy consumption. Finally, conclusions are presented in section 4. 2 Methodology This study first constructs a co-simulation model, that is, a combination of the course timetabling model and the simulation model of building energy consumption. Then, the timetable of a university teaching building in Xi'an, China, from September 2019 to January 2020, is simulated using the proposed method. Finally, the course arrangement and building energy consumption of the optimal solution are obtained. The research framework is shown in Fig. 1 . 2.1 Course timetabling model 2.1.1 Course timetable definition As an example of the problem addressed herein, we consider timetables with only three classrooms (r) (Fig. 2 ). It is assumed that the number of seats in classrooms 1, 2, and 3 are 98, 140, and 190, respectively. In addition, there are 20 courses (c), 15 classes (s), and 17 teachers (t). In summary, there are sets: R = { 1 , ⋯ , 3 } , C = { 1 , ⋯ , 20 } , S = { 1 , ⋯ , 15 } , T = { 1 , ⋯ , 17 } , W = { 1 , ⋯ , 5 } , and J = { 1 , ⋯ , 4 } . In this study, classroom refers to the room in the teaching building, and the variable R represents the set of classrooms. Course refers to the subjects that students need to learn and class refers to a group of students. The variables C , ⋅ S , ⋅ T , ⋅ W , ⋅ a n d ⋅ J are used to represent the variable set of courses, classes, teachers, weekdays, and time slots in a day, respectively. It is assumed that the variables course, class, and teacher formed a fixed combination. For example, the combination ( c = 13 , ⋅ s = 10 , ⋅ t = 11 ) , that is, teacher 11 teaches course 13 to class 10. Timetable optimization involves arranging the time and classrooms for these fixed combinations. This study aims to achieve energy savings by allocating a given number of courses to available classrooms and time periods while satisfying resource constraints and teaching rules. Thus, the objective of course timetabling is to minimize the energy use of classrooms (Eq. (1)). (1) min ( ∑ i = 1 n f i ( X ) ) where n is the number of types of energy-consuming equipment in the classroom, and f i ( X ) is the energy consumption of type i equipment under timetable X . Additionally, a feasible course timetable should satisfy all following hard constraints: ● A teacher can only teach one course at a time, which is ensured by constraint (2). ● A class has at most one course at a time, which is ensured by constraint (3). ● A classroom can only fit one course at a time, which is ensured by constraint (4). ● The number of classroom seats is greater than or equal to the number of students in the course, which is ensured by constraint (5). ● Each course should reach the corresponding frequency of courses per week, which is ensured by constraint (6). (2) ∑ c ∈ C t ∑ r ε R x c r w j ≤ 1 ∀ t ∈ T , w ∈ W , j ∈ J (3) ∑ c ∈ C s ∑ r ε R x c r w j ≤ 1 ∀ s ∈ S , w ∈ W , j ∈ J (4) ∑ c ∈ C x c r w j ≤ 1 ∀ r ∈ R , w ∈ W , j ∈ J (5) A c ∗ x c r w j ≤ b r ∀ c ∈ C , r ∈ R , w ∈ W , j ∈ J (6) ∑ r ∈ R ∑ w ∈ W ∑ j ∈ J x c r w j = F c ∀ c ∈ C where C t denotes the set of courses taught by the teacher t , C s denotes the set of courses for class s , A c denotes the number of students in course c , b r denotes the number of seats in the classroom r , and F c denotes the frequency of courses per week of course c . x c r w j is a binary decision variable that takes a value of 1 if course c ∊ C is planned at period w ∊ W j ∊ J and in room r ∊ R, otherwise the value is 0. 2.1.2 Optimization algorithm This study uses GA to optimize course timetabling. The basic steps of the GA include encoding, generating the initial population, selection, crossover, mutation, loop iteration, and optimal solution output. To obtain a feasible solution under all hard constraints, conflict detection and adjustment should be performed after the new population is generated. In this study, a decimal coding scheme was used, and each teacher's timetable was set as a chromosome. As shown in Fig. 3 , a chromosome, which is composed of 20 genes, contains information about the teacher, class, course, classroom, and time. Specifically, the first two genes represent the teacher's number, the 3rd to 4th genes represent the class number, and the 5th to 7th genes represent the course number. The teacher number and class number start counting from \u201c01,\u201d and the course number starts from \u201c001.\u201d The 8th gene indicates the frequency of a course held in a week, from 1 to 3 (to ensure the learning effect, it is assumed that a course is held three times a week at most). The 9th to 14th genes represent the classroom identity (ID). Specifically, the 9th and 10th genes represent the number of the classroom where the course is held for the first time in a week. The 11th and 12th genes represent the number of the classroom where the course is held for the second time in a week. The 13th and 14th genes represent the number of the classroom where the course is held for the third time in a week. The 15th to 20th genes represent the time ID. The coding rules of time ID are the same as those of the particular classroom ID. The time number consists of two genes, one gene represents the day of the week, and the other gene represents the time slots of the day for that course, starting from \u201c1.\u201d If a course is held only once a week, the 11th to 14th and 17th to 20th genes are represented by 0. If a course is held twice a week, the 13th to 14th and 19th to 20th genes are represented by 0. In addition, the three groups of genes for a particular classroom ID should be different from each other, and the three groups of genes in time ID should also be different. To clearly explain the coding rules of chromosomes, we selected three teachers\u2019 timetables (Fig. 4 ). Teacher ID23 teaches course number 026, which is held once a week. Teacher ID26 teaches course number 030, which is held twice a week. Teacher ID53 teaches course number 061, which is held three times a week. The chromosome codes corresponding to the timetables of teachers ID23, ID26, and ID53 are \u201c23260261130000210000,\u201d \u201c263003021412400114200,\u201d and \u201c53560613114121133453,\u201d respectively. As the aim of this study is to optimize the existing course timetable, the initial population can be determined as the school's existing course timetable, which satisfies all the hard constraints and avoids schedule arrangement conflicts. The roulette method is used in the selection process. Single point crossing is selected as the cross-operation method, and only the classroom and time of course are crossed, that is, the cross point is set between the 9th and 20th positions. Moreover, the cross-operation can only be performed when constraint (5) is satisfied. This operation does not affect the correspondence between the courses taught by each teacher and the class. The basic bit mutation method is selected in the mutation process, and only the time of course is mutated. The change in time should occur within the preset time period. The mutation operation increases the diversity of individuals and avoids the local optimal solution. When the selection, crossover, and mutation processes are complete, new populations are generated. To prevent violations of hard constraints, conflict detection and adjustment are performed. The chromosome coding scheme prevents one teacher from having multiple courses at the same time. Moreover, it provides the frequency of meeting that the course should have per week. The initial population prevents multiple courses being allocated to one classroom at the same time, and the cross-operation and mutation operation does not produce new classroom conflicts. Therefore, it is only necessary to check whether there are multiple courses in a class at the same time. In this study, it is assumed that there are 5 days per week, the available time slots per day is 4, and the available time slots per week is 20. The weekly timetable of teachers is regarded as a two-dimensional array of N rows (N is the number of teachers in the whole school) and 20 columns. An example is shown in Fig. 5 . The conflict detection and adjustment processes are shown in Fig. 6 . The specific steps are as follows: (1) Extract the class ID of the first row and first column in the two-dimensional array. (2) Compare the extracted class ID with the class IDs of other rows in the same column. If the values are the same, an integer x ∈ [j + 1,20] (j is the current number of columns) is randomly generated, and the element is exchanged with the element in column x of the row. The class ID values are then compared again until they are different. (3) Extract the class ID of another row of the column in the two-dimensional array, and repeat step (2) until the class ID of each element in the first column is different. (4) Follow steps (2) and (3) to process the data for the other columns. 2.2 Simulation model of building energy consumption EnergyPlus, which is a commonly used energy consumption calculation software, was used as the simulation tool to determine the hourly energy consumption of university teaching buildings. EnergyPlus can calculate the heating and cooling loads of buildings according to their physical composition and mechanical system, and output detailed data such as indoor and outdoor temperature, humidity, and equipment load [41]. The calculation results from EnergyPlus are more accurate than results from a simplified energy consumption calculation formula. The architectural model is built with reference to an actual university teaching building in Xi'an, China (Fig. 7 ). It includes a frame structure with four floors, a height of 4.5 m, a total construction area of 2108.16 m2, 16 classrooms, and a teacher's lounge. According to the number of seats in the classroom, the 16 classrooms are divided into four types (I, II, III, and IV). Detailed information about the classrooms is shown in Table 1 . The main energy consumption equipment are air conditioners, lights, and projectors. The number of energy consumption equipment varies with the size of classrooms. The details are shown in Table 2 . As personal devices (such as laptops and mobile phones) consume less energy and vary randomly during the course time, their energy consumptions are not considered in this study. The operating schedules of air conditioners and projectors are determined according to whether there is a course occurring in the classroom. If there is a course in the classroom, the air conditioner and projector would be turned on; otherwise, they would be turned off. The \u201cIdealLoadsAirSystem\u201d object in EnergyPlus is used to set the air conditioning system of each room, where the cooling temperature is set to 26 °C and the heating temperature to 20 °C. According to the university's teaching arrangement, the lights in the classrooms generally run from 07:00 to 22:00. During the winter and summer vacations, the lights remain off each day. On weekends, some students will go to the classroom to do homework or review the next course. Therefore, half of the classroom lights are turned on to meet the learning needs of these students. The operation schedule of the lights from Monday to Friday is shown in Fig. 8 . Specifically, during working days, the lighting control strategy is as follows: (1) If the classroom is not scheduled for a whole day, the classroom remains closed and all lights are turned off. (2) During class time (08:30\u201312:00 and 14:00\u201317:30), if the classroom is occupied, all lights are turned on; if not occupied, all lights are turned off. (3) Due to insufficient daylight in the evening (19:30\u201322:00), all lights in the open classrooms are turned on to meet the needs of students for self-study. (4) If there are courses in the morning, students come to the classroom from 07:00. Owing to insufficient daylight, half of the lights in the front row of the classroom are turned on from 07:00 to 08:30 to meet the needs of students who arrive in the classroom early. (5) During lunch (12:00\u201314:00) and dinner hours (17:30\u201319:30), half of the lights in the front row of the classroom are turned on to meet the needs of temporary educational activities or after-school communication between teachers and students. 2.3 Co-simulation model In this study, the BCVTB platform [38] was used to couple EnergyPlus and Matlab. The BCVTB was developed by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in the United States. It is based on the Ptolemy II software environment and uses role-oriented modeling. It designs functional components as roles, and different roles communicate through ports and parameters. The BCVTB platform allows users to couple two or more simulation programs for co-simulation. For example, users can couple building models and simulated HVAC systems from EnergyPlus with simulated control logic from Modelica or Matlab/Simulink, and software data exchange can be performed [38,42]. In this study, the building model is built using EnergyPlus; \u201cExternalInterface\u201d and \u201cExternalInterface:Schedule\u201d objects are specifically used for interlock simulation of EnergyPlus. The course timetabling optimization model is built in Matlab 2017a. The co-simulation model is shown in Fig. 9 . In the first step, the original timetable dates are fed into Matlab. Then, the initial population is generated based on the course timetabling optimization model in Matlab. Matlab outputs the initial population and passes it to the \u201cController\u201d role in BCVTB. The \u201cController\u201d role sets in advance the occupancy state variable of each classroom in all available teaching time periods and then assigns 1 or 0 (1 means there are courses in that classroom and 0 means no courses) to the occupancy state variable according to the coding scheme of each chromosome. Then, the \u201cController\u201d role outputs all variables and sends them to the \u201cExternalInterface\u201d and \u201cExternalInterface:Schedule\u201d object in EnergyPlus. EnergyPlus calculates and outputs the total energy consumption for this population. The total energy consumption is sent to Matlab by EnergyPlus. The GA assigns a corresponding fitness value to each chromosome according to the energy consumption value. After the operation steps of selection, crossover, mutation, conflict detection and adjustment, a new population is generated and sent to the \u201cController\u201d role in BCVTB. The above steps are repeated until the preset maximum number of iterations is reached. 3 Results and discussion The data used in this study were obtained from a real course timetable of a university in Xi'an, China, in the autumn semester of 2019\u20132020 (a total of 19 weeks from September 3, 2019 to January 14, 2020). Fig. 10 shows the students' schedule during the working day. The administration office allows the teachers to hold their courses in four timeslots, between 08:30 and 17:30 on any eligible day. No courses are to be held on Saturday and Sunday, but students are allowed to study in the classrooms. Without special circumstances, the air conditioner and projection equipment during may not be turned on during the self-study time. In the dataset, there were 98 teachers, 99 classes, and 116 courses. The courses can be divided into three categories according to their frequencies: once a week, twice a week, and three times a week (Table 3 ). The purpose of this study is to establish a one-week course timetable from the perspective of building energy efficiency. The course timetable is assumed to be the same every week. The parameters of GA include a chromosome length of 20, population size of 150, crossover probability of 0.5, and mutation probability of 0.01. The number of iterations is set to 5000. The experiment is carried out 30 times. The result of one experiment with the smallest target value among the 30 experiment results is selected as the final result of this study. Fig. 11 shows that with the increase of iteration times, the performance of the algorithm improves effectively and achieves the optimal effect at the 2076th iteration, then keeps the relatively stable value. 3.1 Course arrangement The number of courses scheduled per week in each classroom in the initial and optimized timetables are shown in Fig. 12 . In the initial timetable, 124 courses are scheduled in the morning and 81 in the afternoon. In the optimized timetable, 82 courses are scheduled in the morning and 123 in the afternoon. Compared with the initial timetable, the occupation time of classrooms in the optimized timetable is relatively concentrated. For example, two courses are scheduled every morning in classrooms 12 and 43, and two courses are scheduled every afternoon in classrooms 11, 12, 14, 22, and 43. From Monday to Friday, in the mornings, the use of classrooms is significantly reduced compared with that using the initial timetable. The number of courses scheduled for classrooms 12, 24, and 43 increases, and the number of courses scheduled for the remaining classrooms decreases at varying extents. In particular, the number of courses scheduled in the morning in classrooms 31, 32, 34, 41, and 44 decreases significantly. In the afternoons from Monday to Friday, the occupancy of classrooms significantly increases compared with that using the initial timetable, except for classrooms 13, 33, and 42. In particular, the number of courses scheduled in the afternoon in classrooms 21, 31, 34, 41, and 44 increases significantly. Because of the setting of the lighting system operation scheme (as long as there is a course in the morning/afternoon, the lights in the classroom are turned on throughout the morning/afternoon), there are two consecutive courses in the morning or afternoon in a classroom, which can reduce the power consumption of lighting. Therefore, in the optimal timetable, the occupancy of classrooms is concentrated. In addition, considering the learning effect of students, the administration office usually arranges the courses in the morning. However, from the perspective of building energy efficiency, it is more energy-efficient to arrange the courses in the afternoon in the autumn semester than in the morning. The specific analysis can be found in section 3.2.3. Therefore, in the initial timetable, there are more courses scheduled in the morning than in the afternoon, and in the optimized timetable, there are more courses scheduled in the afternoon than in the morning. To reduce the energy consumption of the teaching building, in the autumn semester, school administrators should arrange more courses in the afternoon. In addition, the compactness of the timetable for the occupation of a classroom should be promoted. That is, it reduces the situation in which a classroom is occupied in only one time slot in the morning or afternoon. 3.2 Energy consumption 3.2.1 Total energy consumption During the entire autumn semester, the total energy consumption of the initial course timetable is 227.2 GJ, of which the power consumption of lighting, projection equipment, HVAC cooling, and HVAC heating is 93.48, 13.49, 49.06, and 71.17 GJ, respectively. The total energy consumption of the optimized timetable is 218.94 GJ, which is 3.6% less than that of the initial timetable. The optimized lighting power consumption is 87.21 GJ, which is 6.71% less than that of the initial timetable. The power consumption of the projection equipment remains the same. The HVAC cooling load increases to 57.95 GJ, which is 18.12% higher than that in case of the initial timetable, and the HVAC heat load decreases to 60.29 GJ, which is 15.29% lower than that in case of the initial timetable (Fig. 13 ). In the optimized timetable, the occupied classrooms are relatively concentrated. The operating time of lighting during the daytime would decrease accordingly due to daylight savings from more courses in the afternoon. Therefore, the lighting power consumption is reduced. As the projection equipment is only turned on during the course, the running time of the projection equipment is related to the total course time in all classrooms in a week. The optimization timetable does not change the total course time, so the related power consumption remains the same. In the optimized solution, the courses are mainly concentrated in the afternoon, thus increasing the cooling load of the HVAC and decreasing the heating load. The heating load reduction is more significant than the cooling load increase. Overall, the air conditioning system can save 1.66% of the total energy consumed with the optimized solution compared with the initial timetable. 3.2.2 Energy consumption of lighting and projection equipment As the weekly timetable is the same throughout the semester, there is no weekly change in the power consumption for lighting and projection equipment. Therefore, this study only analyzes the power consumption of lighting and projection equipment within one week (September 3 to 9). Accordingly, the power consumption changes for lighting and projection equipment are shown in Figs. 14 and 15 , respectively. The lighting power consumption of the optimized timetable on Saturday, and Sunday does not change compared with the initial timetable. Every morning and evening on weekdays, the power consumption of lighting is reduced. Every afternoon from Tuesday to Friday, the power consumption of lighting increases. Throughout the week, compared with the initial timetable, the power consumption of lighting is reduced in the optimized timetable. In the timetables before and after optimization, the power consumption of the projection equipment on Saturday and Sunday is zero. Compared with the initial timetable, the power consumption of the projection equipment in the optimal timetable is reduced in the morning and increased in the afternoon from Monday to Friday. Throughout the week, the total power consumption of the projection does not change. Because lighting power consumption accounts for more than 40% of the total energy consumption, reducing lighting power consumption is essential for reducing the total energy consumption of teaching buildings. Making optimum use of daylight can help reduce energy consumption. For example, it can avoid situations where a course is scheduled in the first time slot in the morning. Thus, it can avoid situations when some lights must be turned on in advance to meet lighting requirements due to insufficient daylight during 07:00\u20138:30. In addition, the number of lights should be turned on according to the number of occupants in the classroom. For example, in the case of a small number of occupants in the classroom, the teacher should ask the students to sit in the front row to turn off unnecessary lighting. 3.2.3 Energy consumption of HVAC The HVAC operation time is analyzed from September 3 to January 14. Xi'an city in western China has a climate driven by the continental monsoon, with hot, humid summers, and cold, dry winters [43]. The outdoor air temperature (Ta) and relative humidity (RH) of Xi'an from September to January are shown in Fig. 16 . The meteorological data used in this study are derived from the EnergyPlus simulation software website [44]. From September to January, the monthly maximum temperature is 33.2 °C, 27 °C, 18 °C, 10 °C, and 12.2 °C, and the monthly minimum temperature is 13.3 °C, 6.4 °C, −1.4 °C, −5.6 °C, and −7 °C, respectively. Therefore, the cooling demand in the autumn semester is mainly concentrated in September and October, and the heating demand is mainly concentrated in November, December, and January. The cooling and heating loads of the HVAC system are shown in Figs. 17 and 18 , respectively. According to the optimized timetable, at most time slots from September and October, the cooling load of the HVAC significantly decreased from 09:00 to 12:00, and significantly increased from 15:00 to 18:00. Nevertheless, it does not significantly change in other periods. During the period from 09:00 to 12:00 and 15:00 to 18:00 every day in the autumn semester, the maximum difference between the cooling load value of the optimized timetable and that of the initial timetable occurred on September 19 and September 17, with a difference of 0.77 GJ and 1.10 GJ, respectively. According to the optimized timetable, in most time slots of November, December, and January, the heating load significantly decreased during 09:00\u201312:00, and slightly increased during 15:00\u201318:00. Nevertheless, it does not significantly change in other periods. During 09:00\u201312:00 and 15:00\u201318:00 every day in the autumn semester, the maximum difference between the heating load value of the optimized timetable and that of the initial timetable occurred on January 12, with a difference of 0.98 GJ and 0.77 GJ, respectively. Compared with the initial timetable, the usage rate of classrooms in the optimized timetable increases in the afternoon. Therefore, the probability of using the HVAC in the afternoon increases, and the corresponding cooling load increases significantly during the cooling period. As the classrooms are occupied for a long time in the afternoon, the temperature in the afternoon is generally higher than that in the morning. To maintain a constant indoor temperature of 20 °C, the heat load provided by the HVAC system does not increase significantly during the heating period. Compared with the initial timetable, not many courses are scheduled in the morning in the optimized timetable, so fewer classrooms need to be heated by the HVAC in the morning during the heating period. Accordingly, the HVAC heat load is reduced in the morning. In the autumn semester, the heating period is longer than the cooling period. Therefore, in the optimized timetable, the decrease in the HVAC heat load is greater than the increase in the cooling load. According to the simulation results, to reduce the cooling load and heat load provided by HVAC, school administrators should arrange more courses in the morning in September and October, and more courses in the afternoon in November, December, and January. In addition, an intelligent HVAC control system should be designed to intelligently control the running time and set temperature of the HVAC according to the occupation of the classroom. 4 Conclusions To solve the problems of high energy consumption of teaching buildings in universities, this study aims to optimize course timetables from the perspective of building energy efficiency to reduce the building energy consumption of teaching buildings. A course timetable optimization method based on the BCVTB platform is developed in this study. Specifically, EnergyPlus is used to accurately calculate building energy consumption, Matlab is used to optimize the course timetable, and the interlocked simulation between Matlab and EnergyPlus is conducted through BCVTB. Based on the optimization method, the course timetable of a university teaching building in Xi'an, China during the autumn semester is simulated. The final simulation results show the following: ● Compared with the initial timetable, the optimized timetable schedules fewer courses in the morning and more courses in the afternoon. In addition, the occupancy of classrooms in the optimized timetable is relatively concentrated timewise. The probability that two courses in a classroom are arranged consecutively increases. ● Throughout the autumn semester, the optimization of timetable reduced energy consumption by 3.6%. The power consumption of lighting decreased by 6.71%; the power consumption of the projection equipment remained unchanged; the cooling load increased by 18.12%, and the heat load reduced by 15.29%. ● The cooling load in the optimized timetable significantly decreased from 09:00 to 12:00, and significantly increased from 15:00 to 18:00 during the cooling period. The heating load significantly decreased from 09:00 to 12:00 and slightly increased from 15:00 to 18:00 during the heating period. In addition, the decrease in the HVAC heat load is greater than the increase in the cooling load in the optimized timetable. The developed analysis and optimization of course timetables enable energy conservation in teaching buildings of universities. Moreover, this study contributes to the design and operation management of teaching buildings. First, when building a new teaching building, according to the course arrangement of the optimized timetable, the total number of classrooms in the teaching building and the number of classrooms of different sizes can be reasonably planned in advance. Second, according to the number of occupants in the classroom at different times, the parameters and quantities of energy-consuming equipment (e.g., HVAC and lighting) can be determined to meet the energy demand at each occupancy time. In addition, according to the optimized timetable, universities can design intelligent equipment control systema to scientifically manage the operating time and power of the equipment. However, this study has the following limitations. First, the optimal timetable obtained in this study may not achieve the optimal quality in other aspects (e.g., student learning efficiency). Second, the energy efficiency effect of the course timetable obtained by the simulation method needs to be verified in practical applications. In future work, a multi-objective model will be established to optimize the timetable for reducing building energy consumption and improving students\u2019 thermal comfort, which can improve the usability of the proposed optimization method. Moreover, energy consumption monitoring data will be used to verify accuracy of the simulation results.

        "dc:description": "It is difficult to prompt students to take energy saving behaviors proactively owing to their limited responsibilities for energy saving; thus, administrators are required to actively adopt management means to reduce building energy consumption. Reasonable arrangement of course timetables by administrators can greatly promote energy efficiency in university buildings, as the energy consumption of teaching buildings is closely related to factors such as occupancy time and number of users. Hence, this study develops a co-simulation method based on the Building Controls Virtual Test Bed (BCVTB) platform using genetic algorithm to optimize university timetable considering building energy efficiency. The timetable of a university teaching building in Xi'an, China, from September 2019 to January 2020, is simulated using the proposed method. According to the simulation results, the occupancy of classrooms in the optimized timetable is relatively concentrated timewise. As more courses are allocated in the afternoon, the operating time of lighting during the daytime would decrease accordingly. Therefore, the lighting power consumption is reduced. In addition, the cooling load of the teaching building is increased and the heating load of the teaching building decreases. The results indicate that the utilization of the proposed course timetabling method can reduce the energy consumption of teaching buildings by approximately 3.6% in the autumn semester. The developed method helps administrators arrange a timetable to achieve energy efficiency in university buildings. Moreover, it is helpful for the design and operation management of teaching buildings.",
