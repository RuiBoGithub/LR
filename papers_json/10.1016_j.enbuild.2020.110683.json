Graphical abstract A 4025 m2 office building was built in Beijing, China, in 2014 as a living laboratory and prototype to explore the technical energy systems of nearly zero energy buildings (NZEBs) in China. Not only the building itself but also the heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems were designed with flexibility to explore their performance. Solar-assisted air conditioning (SAAC) and ground source heat pump (GSHP) systems with different terminal units were designed as HVAC systems for either experimental, comparison, or measurement purposes. In this paper, the cooling operation of multienergy systems is discussed on the basis of actual measurement data. HVAC systems have three possible types of operation configuration types, namely, SAAC priority, GSHP only and multimode. Operation scenarios for these configurations are presented first, and the small-scale simulation was carried out to analyze the performance of SAAC priority and GSHP#1 only mode. It indicates that SAAC could save about 47% of energy than that of GSHP#1. Then, the actual operation performance in 2018 was analyzed by reference to the operation data. Through this study, it is found that 1) multienergy systems of SAAC and GSHP operated well in this NZEBs during the summer season; 2) a 10 RT absorption chiller can work well for an NZEB building of approximately 1000 m2 when outdoor enthalpy is low and the solar radiation is stronger than 400 W/m2 as a result of high building thermal performance and air tightness; 3) SAAC can save about 40 to 50% of energy compared to that of GSHP system when providing services for the same terminal system under the same outdoor weather conditions and 4) The GSHP system is a good complement to the SAAC system which works well in June, September and early July when outdoor enthalpy is low. This study indicates that a combination of GSHP and SAAC systems is highly promising for NZEBs in cold climate zones such as Beijing, where the solar radiation is sound.

Building energy use accounted for 20% of the total primary energy consumption of China in 2016 [2], and this percentage is expected to increase with rapid urbanization. Ultralow energy/nearly zero energy/zero energy buildings are recognized as a promising solution for this problem since they are the most energy-saving and high-performance buildings [3]. Renewable energy contributes greatly to the realization of nearly zero energy, zero energy(GB/T 51350\u20132019). Among renewable energy systems, solar thermal/photovoltaic (PV) and heat pump (HP) systems are the most commonly utilized. Many demonstration projects have achieved nearly zero or net zero energy by means of PV systems, HP systems and electricity generated by PV systems has been utilized in buildings [4,6,7,8,18]. The application of solar-assisted HP systems has also been widely utilized to help realize nearly zero energy or net zero energy buildings. In past projects, such systems have mostly been utilized as auxiliary systems to increase heat performance, decrease primary investment and achieve heat balance [6,10,11,10,13,14]. An economic and energy analysis has been carried out in which it was inferred that a PV system in combination with an HP system is a superior alternative to a solar thermal system in combination with an HP system in Sweden [15]. In recent years, Solar thermal systems have been more widely used in combination with absorption chillers as dependent cooling systems [19,17,18,19,20]. Combined with an HP system, a multienergy system could provide cooling, heating and ventilation in a more energy-efficient way to realize nearly zero energy. But, by reviewing the current studies, it can be seen that most of them have focused on simulation or design purposes, while few have focused on real system operation analysis (to the best of our knowledge). This study is the first to analyze the cooling operation performance of a combined solar-assisted air conditioning (SAAC) and ground source heat pump (GSHP) system in a nearly zero energy office building on the basis of actual operation data. The pilot nearly zero energy building (NZEB) is introduced first, and the multienergy systems and their possible operation configurations are addressed and analyzed in TRANSYS afterward. System operation in the summer season of 2018 is then discussed with reference to actual operation data. This discussion can serve as a valuable reference for the proper operation of multi-renewable energy systems in NZEBs. 2 System description 2.1 Pilot building The pilot building is a four-story office building of 4025 m2 in which approximately 180 people are normally working and is located in Beijing (Fig. 1 ), in the northern part of China. It was designed as the first nearly zero energy office building in the cold region of China. Not only the building itself but also the heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems were designed with the flexibility to test different technologies and control strategies to satisfy the design target and mission. It is regarded as a living laboratory and prototype for exploring the technical systems of NZEBs in China. The envelope of the building has high thermal insulation capabilities to reduce the cooling and heating demands compared to the current design standard for public buildings in China (GB 50189\u20132015). Specifically, 25 mm of vacuum insulation board with a thermal conductivity of 0.004 W/(m·K) was used for the external wall. The windows, which have a K value of 1.2 W/(m2·K), were constructed with vacuum glass and internal electrical shading devices. For the roof of the building, 200 mm of expanded polystyrene (EPS) with a thermal conductivity of 0.03 W/(m·K) was used. Careful attention was paid to the detailed design and construction in order to avoid thermal bridges and maintain good airtightness. Further thermal information and the energy targets of the building are shown in Table 1 . Due to very good building envelope performance and airtightness maintenance, the energy consumption for heating, cooling and lighting is targeted to be less than 25 kWh/(m2·a), and the indoor environment is expected to remain at a comfortable level throughout the whole year, according to the original design. The maximum cooling load is designed to be less than 40 kWh/(m2·a). It has been reported that the average energy consumption (electricity intensity) levels of office buildings in Shanghai and Shenzhen are between 80\u2013120 and 91 kWh/(m2·a), respectively [2]. Hence, if the pilot building is operated properly, it is expected to achieve an energy savings of more than 70% compared to the current energy intensity level. 2.2 Building load The hourly heating/cooling loads of the building were calculated using the Designer\u2019s Simulation Toolkit (DeST) [21], which is a software platform for building environment and HVAC system simulation produced by Tsinghua University. The parameters set in the calculation were obtained from the national standard \u201cDesign standard for energy efficiency of public buildings\u201d (GB 50189\u20132015) and the building design document. Based on the model simulation, the hourly loads of the building throughout the typical meteorological year (TMY) are calculated. The hourly cooling and heating loads of the building are plotted in black and grey points in Fig. 2 , respectively; the X-axis represents 8760 h of one year; and the Y-axis represents the building load (W/m2). It is found from the simulation results that the maximum cooling load is approximately 40 W/m2. The load calculation was carried out under the ideal assumptions that the density of people inside the building has a constant value of 10 m2/p, all windows are closed when the HVAC system is working, and natural ventilation is used when the outdoor temperature is ≤ 28 °C and the relative humidity is less than 70%, during which time the cooling load is not calculated. Other parameters were set in accordance with the design standard for the energy efficiency of public buildings [GB/T 50189\u20132015]. However, large differences from the calculated loads were observed in actual operation: windows were sometimes found open during the cooling period, no natural ventilation was carried out when the outdoor weather conditions were highly feetable, meeting rooms were fully occupied during working hours even weekend, and more highly energy-consuming equipment was utilized and not powered off on weekends; consequently, the actual cooling loads were different from, and always larger than, the calculated loads. Nevertheless, the simulation results could correctly guide the operation of the system. 2.3 HVAC systems 2.3.1 System description Because of the experimental nature of the building, its HVAC systems are quite diverse and complicated. SAAC, GSHP, water-cooled variable refrigerant flow (VRF), and variable refrigerant volume (VRV) systems and other systems work together to provide heating, cooling and ventilation for the building. On different floors, either wind or water systems are designed as terminal systems for the targets of experimental comparisons. 140 pieces of medium\u2013high temperature vacuum tube solar collectors installed on the roof with a total lighting area of \u200b\u200b284.2 m2 (Fig. 3 ) which provide hot water to drive the absorption chiller (AC) for building cooling.70 Boreholes with approximately 5000 m length are distributed on the front and back sides of the building to provide heat sources or sinks for the systems. The logic diagram for the operation of the HVAC systems in cooling mode is shown in Fig. 4 . One water-cooled VRF system and one VRV system are designed to provide space cooling of the 1st and 4th floors, respectively, while one 10 RT AC and a 50 kW GSHP unit (GSHP#1) serving as a backup are designed to provide ventilation of these two floors. A 99.5 kW GSHP unit (GSHP#2) is used to serve both the ventilation and space cooling demands of the 3rd floor (through a ceiling radiation system and a temperature and humidity independent control system with heat recovery) and to provide space cooling only for the 2nd floor (through floor radiation). A liquid desiccant unit works as a supplementary system to satisfy the space cooling and ventilation requirements of the 2nd floor when the fan coil system is operating. Due to the flexible connections of the pipes, the AC can also be connected to the ceiling radiation to provide ventilation and space cooling for the 3rd floor as well. A water tank is designed to storage cold water for direct cooling through ceiling or floor radiation system which is produced either by AC or GSHP#1 in weekends. Because of the flexible pipe connections between chillers and pumps, the possible system operation configurations to realize energy savings and indoor comfort are complex and challenging. It is also inferred that the energy consumption and conservation potential are determined by how the system is operated. The VRF, VRV and liquid desiccant systems serve fixed regions, and their potential for energy savings is limited, whereas that of the combined operation of the SAAC and GSHP systems, as indicated by the red dotted box in Fig. 5 , might be much greater. Therefore, the SAAC and GSHP systems are the main subjects of discussion in this paper. The water storage system is mostly used for experimental purposes; therefore, it also is not discussed here. The parameters of the chillers are listed in Table 2 . The AC is supplied by YAZAKi, and it operates when the hot medium temperature is above 74 °C, and the coefficient of performance (COP) will be approximately 0.7 when it is 88 °C. The hot medium temperature depends on the level of solar radiation. GSHP units were supported by CLIMAVENETA. Considering the load capabilities and simulation results, either GSHP#1 or the SAAC is able to serve approximately 1000 m2 of the building area throughout the most of cooling season according to their specifications; and GSHP#2 could provide cooling for more than 2 floors. 2.3.2 Measurement system A complete energy management system has been established to realize real-time monitoring and recording of energy consumption of chillers, pumps and terminal systems, as well as the amount of cooling and heating supplied by energy systems to the building using smart sensors and meters. The characteristic of the sensors and the meters are shown in Table 3 . Installation of the sensors is shown in Fig. 6 , of which T represents water temperature and F means water flowrate. 3 Operation description 3.1 Possible operation configurations It is seen from Figs. 4 and 5 that the 2nd floor has two kinds of cooling terminals, a wind system (fan coil) and a water system (floor radiation), which can work either together or separately. The floor radiation system is connected to GSHP#2. The system was primarily used in 2015 for cooling but was shut off in the second year and the fan coil unit was chosen for cooling instead since the building occupants felt cold in foot. From then on, GSHP#2 has served the 3rd floor only in the summer season. Focusing on the flexible correspondence between systems and floors, the possible configurations are simplified and summarized in Table 4 . The SAAC system can provide ventilation loads for the 1st and 4th floors, GSHP#1 acts as a backup when the SAAC system is not operating properly, GSHP#2 serves mainly the 2nd and 3rd floors, and the SAAC system acts as a backup only for the 3rd floor. 3.2 Operation control logics Four operation configurations can be identified from the above analysis: 1) SAAC + GSHP#1, 2) SAAC/GSHP#2 + GSHP#1, and 3) SAAC/GSHP#1 + GSHP#2, 4) GSHP#2 + GSHP#1. The energy system is generally started on a time schedule. The indoor air temperature is first judged at the scheduled time, and the system will start when the indoor air temperature and relative humidity exceed 26 °C and 60%, respectively. Generally, operation strategies are shown in Fig. 7 . Configuration 1: SAAC priority. The SAAC system is prioritized for the 3rd floor if the hot medium temperature is available. Meanwhile, GSHP#1 is chosen to provide ventilation for the 1stand 4th floors as well as cooling load for the 2nd floor. Configuration 2: Multimode. GSHP#1 provides ventilation load for the 1st and 4th floors as well as partial cooling load of the 2nd floor. The SAAC system and GSHP#2 work as primary and backup to serve the 3rd floor. There are two possibilities for operation. One is that the SAAC system begins to work first and GSHP#2 serves as a backup. The other is GSHP#2 operates first to down the cooling load, and then the SAAC system starts. The choice between these two possibilities depends on the outside environment. Configuration 3: Multimode. GSHP#1 or the SAAC system serves the ventilation loads of the 1st and 4th floors and part of the space cooling load of the 2nd floor. GSHP#2 works for the 3rd floor only. In this configuration, the SAAC system or GSHP#1 works as a backup. Configuration 4: GSHP only. The SAAC system stops because of rainy or cloudy weather, and the whole building is served by the GSHP systems. Configurations 2 and 3 function under the logic of efficiency priority; the difference is which floor(s) the SAAC system serves. 3.3 Operation simulation and optimization A simulation in TRNSYS is carried out to evaluate the operation of the system in SAAC priority and GSHP only modes. Energy consumption of the two configurations in the same weather condition are calculated and compared. Since P0 are shared by all the chillers in the cooling side (seen in Fig. 4), energy consumption of pumps to each chiller are calculated according to equal proportion of flow rate. Rated capacity of the circulation pumps and components of energy consumption of each modes are listed in Table5 , and characteristics of chillers are shown in Table 1 as described in previous section. It is found that rated capacity of pumps and energy consumption of SAAC mode is the lowest since absorption chiller consumes almost no power at all. It is also infers that SAAC priority mode will be the most energy-efficient if it is available, and GSHP only is the least one. The schematic designs for system simulation in TRANSYS are shown in Figs. 8 and 9 which describe SAAC priority and GSHP only modes respectively. System simulation was built according to the actual design, and the building loads calculated from DeST were loaded as input. system operation and energy consumptions under different modes were simulated and compared. Since the operation of SAAC was influenced by outdoor weather conditions, system operation in June (solar radiation is strong and load is less than 30 kW most of the time) was carried out only for comparation. the calculation results of the tree modes are plotted in Figs. 10 and 11 . It can be seen from Fig. 10 that COP of AC and GSHP#1 is higher than that of rated conditions, with an average of 0.75 and 6.5 respectively. Hourly energy consumption of GSHP#1 and AC are shown in right figure of Fig. 10. Similarly, GSHP#1 and GSHP#2 have an operating COP of about 6.0 and 6.4 respectively, as shown in Fig. 11. Average hourly energy consumption of about 4.5 and 6.4 kWh respectively. Total energy consumption of SAAC priority and GSHP only mode are approximately 116.85 and 190.3 kWh/d, respectively. It is known from the above simulation that if the system works in SAAC priority mode, the energy consumption is much lower than that in GSHP only mode, 39% of energy saving could be achieved, even 43% of energy saving will be achieved if consider energy consumption of solar collection system though this section did not provide effective work (to promise safety of solar collective system, circulation pumps had been running during day time). If hot water temperature is available to drive AC, it is the highest priority than other operation strategies but it highly depends on solar radiation which is unreliable. 4 Operation discussion These HVAC systems have been in operation for almost 5 years and are under continuous commissioning. In the following sections, the system operation and energy consumption in different modes in 2018 are shared and discussed. It is found that system operation strategy is selected according to outdoor weather changes. 4.1 Ambient data The operation of the SAAC system depends solely on the hot medium temperature, which is completely determined by the level of solar radiation. In other words, the system operation is dependent on the outside weather conditions. The ambient air temperature and humidity from 8:00 to 18:00 during the summer season of 2018 are plotted in Fig. 12 . The grey and blue points represent the relative humidity and air temperature, respectively. The temperature ranged from a minimum of 20 °C to a maximum of almost 40 °C, and the relative humidity was higher than 50% most of the time. The hourly air humidity and enthalpy were calculated and plotted in black and blue points, and the monthly average results are shown in Table 6 and Fig. 13 . June is characterized by high temperature and low humidity, with an average enthalpy below 60 kJ/kg, whereas July and August are characterized by high temperature and high humidity, with enthalpy values of 69.6 and 65.6 kJ/kg, respectively. September is low temperature and low humidity, with an average air temperature of approximately 23.3℃ and an enthalpy of approximately 39.9 kJ/kg. Thus, in regard to solar radiation, it seems that the enthalpy increases and the average radiation decreases from June to August. 4.2 Operation statistics The numbers of days spent operating in different configurations during the summer season were calculated, as shown in Table 7 . Configuration 1 corresponds to SAAC priority mode, configuration 2 corresponds to GSHP only mode, and configurations 3 and 4 together correspond to Multimode, in accordance with the previous description. In configurations 5 and 6, GSHP#1 produced and stored cold water in the tank during the night or on the weekend, which could then be utilized in the daytime for cooling; the corresponding mode is called the cold storage (CS) mode. However, this mode is not discussed here since it was established for experimental purposes only. The operation days in each mode and the corresponding environmental conditions are plotted in Fig. 14 , and the energy consumption and system performance of the 3 most common operation modes are discussed in the following section. Fig. 14 shows that the system worked in the SAAC priority mode for 16 days in June, whereas it worked mainly in the multimode configurations and the GSHP only mode in July and August. The experiment modes, SAAC + CS and SAAC + GSHP#1 + CS, were used for 4 days in June and 3 days in September in weekends. Strong solar radiation guarantees a high hot medium temperature, enabling the operation of the AC; moreover, with relatively low entropy in advance, the SAAC priority mode can work well in June. In July, the relative humidity is high, and the solar radiation is relatively weak; consequently, GSHP only and multimode operations worked most of the time. The conditions are almost the same in August, although because of the relatively high radiation and low entropy compared with those in July, the system spent more days operating in the GSHP only mode than in the multimode configurations in August. 4.3 Operation analysis In this section, the energy consumption and system performance (COP/system coefficient of performance (SCOP)) of the three modes are analyzed based on the measured data. The COPs of the GSHP units and the AC are analyzed in accordance with Eqs. (1) and (2), respectively: (1) C O P hp = Q r / E hp where Q r is the cooling energy provided to the building by the HP unit (kWh) and E hp is the energy consumption of the HP unit itself. (2) C O P A C = Q r / Q hw where Q r is the energy provided to the room by the AC (kWh) and Q hw is the hot medium energy consumption. The SCOPs of the GSHP units are calculated using Eq. (3): (3) SC O P hpsys = Q r / ( E hp + E p ) where Ep is the energy consumption of the circulation pumps. The calculation dimensions for the COP and SCOP computations are listed in Table 8 below. The daily performance of the AC, GSHP#1 and GSHP#2 on typical days is discussed below. The SAAC system and GSHP#1 worked on days of lower temperature and humidity, and their performance on June 5th is plotted in Figs. 15 and 16 . GSHP#1 and GSHP#2 worked on rainy or cloudy days, and their operation on July 10th is illustrated in Figs. 17 and 18 . The combined operation of GSHP#1, GSHP#2 and the SAAC system is shown in Fig. 19\u201321 . The light yellow points represent the COP of each unit. The blue and green points represent the chilled water temperatures on the primary side, and the dark yellow and gray points indicate the chilled water temperatures on the secondary side. The average COP and other parameters for a typical day are listed in Table 9 . The building was working in the SAAC priority mode on June 5th, when the average air temperature and relatively humidity were approximately 17.5 °C and 33.7%, respectively, with an average solar radiation level of 576.3 W/m2. The SAAC system was working with an average hot medium temperature of approximately 78 °C, and the daily COP was approximately 0.66. GSHP#1 was working with a COP of 4.9, lower than that in the standard mode, possibly because of slightly leakage of R410A which was found after one season operation. On July 10th, the average solar radiance was only approximately 212.3 W/m2, and the outside relative humidity reached 65.3%, resulting in a very high dehumidification load. GSHP#1 and GSHP#2 were operating. The daily COPs were approximately 4.8 and 6.41, respectively, and the SCOPs were approximately 3.46 and 3.85, respectively. The system was working under multimode conditions on August 1st. The average air temperature and humidity were approximately 34.9 °C and 50.1%, respectively, and the solar radiation was approximately 361.6 W/m2. GSHP#1 began to operate first for the ventilation system, and the AC started working from approximately 9:35 am. GSHP#2 served the third floor for the whole day. GSHP#1, GSHP#2 and the AC worked at high COPs of approximately 6.41, 6.0 and 0.65, respectively. Through comparison of energy consumption for typical days, SAAC has the lowest energy consumption amount of the three modes, and multienergy mode has about 6% less energy consumption than the GSHP only mode; and energy saving could be up to 15.96% if the energy consumption of the solar thermal system is considered even it does not contribute to the system at all. The average performance of the three modes on their operation days in the summer season of 2018 is summarized in Table 10 . A comparison of the system operations in three modes is discussed below. The daily average energy consumption of each mode and average environmental parameter are shown in Fig. 22 , where the primary Y-axis represents the energy consumption of each mode and the secondary Y-axis represents the average daily air enthalpy. It is found that from the system point of view, the SAAC priority mode saves the most energy, while GSHP only consumes the most energy. If take GSHP only mode as base line, SAAC priority mode would get about 47% of energy saving while multi-mode would have about 12% energy saving. This is a little unfair for this mode because circulation pumps of solar thermal consumes 15% of energy to keep this subsystem safety with no contribution to the whole system. It can be seen from Fig. 1 that the solar thermal system has two pumps (P1,P1-1); to prevent overheating of the solar collectors, pump 1 continues circulation during the daytime. If this circulation pump could work in a more energy-saving way, more energy savings might be possible with multimode operations and GSHP only modes. 5 Conclusion and future work This paper has discussed the cooling operation of a combination of multienergy and multiterminal HVAC systems in an NZEB in Beijing. A combined SAAC and GSHP system is the main and most flexible part of the overall system. Because it is an experimental system, the chillers can be connected to different terminal systems, providing three different operation modes during the cooling season: SAAC priority mode, GSHP only mode and multimode operation. These modes and their corresponding working conditions have been discussed on the basis of actual operation data from 2018. The dynamic performance of the system in each mode on typical days was presented, and the chiller and system performance during summer season of 2018 was presented and analyzed in advance. The following conclusions may be drawn: It is found that a combination of SAAC and GSHP systems works well in this NZEB, different working modes could be configurated through system design. Among these modes, three of them are frequently utilized in cooling season. Thanks to NZEB design, which guarantee good airtightness and thermal insulation, the cooling load is much less than that of a normal office building. A 10 RT AC can work well for an area of approximately 1000 m2 when the outdoor enthalpy is low and the solar radiation is stronger than 400 W/m2. The GSHP system is a good complement to the SAAC system. The former can work well in any weather conditions when the latter is highly depended on hot medium temperature which is influenced by solar radiation. When the system works under the multienergy mode, the former could work firstly to lower the building load and then switch to the latter if hot water is capable then,since the building load is not sensitive to outside environment due to good building performance. In view of the energy consumption of the chillers, the SAAC priority mode is the most energy-saving, and it will be 47% of energy saving compared to that of the GSHP only mode, the multienergy strategy could get about 17% of energy saving. It must admitted that GSHP system is reliable than SAAC system in this design. Therefore, the multienergy system shows their unique advantages of the two. Also, it would be preferable to optimize the operation of the circulation system to save energy so that, the energy saving would be more. The authors will continue to study the operation of the system and focus on optimizing the circulation system to ensure much lower energy consumption.

        "dc:description": "A 4025 m2 office building was built in Beijing, China, in 2014 as a living laboratory and prototype to explore the technical energy systems of nearly zero energy buildings (NZEBs) in China. Not only the building itself but also the heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems were designed with flexibility to explore their performance. Solar-assisted air conditioning (SAAC) and ground source heat pump (GSHP) systems with different terminal units were designed as HVAC systems for either experimental, comparison, or measurement purposes. In this paper, the cooling operation of multienergy systems is discussed on the basis of actual measurement data. HVAC systems have three possible types of operation configuration types, namely, SAAC priority, GSHP only and multimode. Operation scenarios for these configurations are presented first, and the small-scale simulation was carried out to analyze the performance of SAAC priority and GSHP#1 only mode. It indicates that SAAC could save about 47% of energy than that of GSHP#1. Then, the actual operation performance in 2018 was analyzed by reference to the operation data. Through this study, it is found that 1) multienergy systems of SAAC and GSHP operated well in this NZEBs during the summer season; 2) a 10 RT absorption chiller can work well for an NZEB building of approximately 1000 m2 when outdoor enthalpy is low and the solar radiation is stronger than 400 W/m2 as a result of high building thermal performance and air tightness; 3) SAAC can save about 40 to 50% of energy compared to that of GSHP system when providing services for the same terminal system under the same outdoor weather conditions and 4) The GSHP system is a good complement to the SAAC system which works well in June, September and early July when outdoor enthalpy is low. This study indicates that a combination of GSHP and SAAC systems is highly promising for NZEBs in cold climate zones such as Beijing, where the solar radiation is sound.",
