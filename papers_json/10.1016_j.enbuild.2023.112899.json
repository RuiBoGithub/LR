Graphical abstract Recently, Occupant-Centric Control (OCC) strategies have gained mounting interest. Previous studies made use of OCC strategies for adjusting the operation of heating/cooling systems, improving indoor thermal comfort and governing mechanical ventilation systems. However, a very limited number of studies have applied OCC strategies to natural ventilation systems. Further, the feasibility of establishing OCC strategies for controlling indoor thermal comfort, energy use and specifically air quality has received much less attention and investigation. This paper presented an Occupant-Centric Heating and Natural Ventilation Control (OCHNVC) strategy for enhancing indoor thermal comfort, building energy performance and indoor air quality. Firstly, real-time profiles of occupant behavior and window opening in a case study building were collected using artificial intelligence (AI)-powered cameras and deep vision algorithms. Secondly, shallow artificial-neural-networks predictive models were established for forecasting the responses of the studied building to different levels of occupant behavior and window opening behavior. Thirdly, an OCHNVC strategy tailored to the studied room was proposed and applied to the studied room. The strategy could lower heating energy consumption by between 0.6 % and 29.0 % and improve the level of indoor thermal comfort by between 0 % and 58.8 %, relative to a conventional control strategy. Moreover, the conventional window control strategy only maintained indoor CO2 concentrations below 1000 ppm for 59.7 % of the period that occupants were within the studied room, while the proposed controller could do so for 89.2 % of the period. Future works shall focus on experimentally deploying the strategy to real buildings and evaluating its performance.

Buildings represent appropriately-one-third of total global final energy [64], 39 % of the energy consumption in the U.S. [5], 40 % in Europe [42]. Moreover, it has been widely acknowledged that buildings are also responsible for significant greenhouse gas emissions, which can cause climate change and global warming. The building sector contributed around 50 % of total carbon emissions in the U.K. [9,27], 36 % in Europe [3], 35 %-50 % in China [67] and 23 % in South Korea. The need for achieving energy conservation in buildings and decarbonization of buildings is inevitable [22,28]. Heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems are one of the largest building energy consumers among all building services and appliances. HVAC systems aim to control indoor conditions that occupants would be satisfied with, however, at the expense of high energy consumption. Quantitatively, HVAC systems can account for 15%\u201360% of building energy consumption [24,46]. Previous studies have focused on lowering building energy consumption by means of applying energy-efficient controllers [19,25,65]. Additionally, attention has also been drawn to developing HVAC controllers that could lower building energy consumption and increase the level of indoor thermal comfort [23,57,34,40,33]. Further, a number of studies have succeeded in lessening HVAC energy consumption and improving indoor air quality (IAQ) by implementing more advanced HVAC controllers [36,52,20]. Besides, a few studies proposed HVAC controllers that simultaneously improved building energy consumption, indoor thermal comfort and IAQ [10,61]. 1.2 Literature review on occupant-centric control strategy During the past decade, Occupant-Centric Control (OCC) strategies have gained growing interest. OCC strategies gather information on occupant behavior and adjust HVAC operations based on a set of specific control policies. Therefore, such strategies can effectively deal with complicated interactions between occupant behavior and HVAC operation. This can hardly be achieved by using traditional control strategies as they ignore the impacts of occupant behavior on HVAC operation. In fact, occupant behaviour can be the key to influencing building energy consumption [41,68] and HVAC energy consumption [4,6]. Occupancy behaviour is likely irregular, stochastic, highly time-varying [26]. Sometimes occupancy behavior is even unpredictable and the profiles of occupancy behavior are unavailable. Therefore, there has been a demand for obtaining information on occupancy behavior. To meet this demand, several studies managed to forecast occupant behavior by establishing various predictive models. [17,14,66]. It must be noted that, although such predictive models did yield good prediction accuracy in the above studies, the reliability and robustness of such models still require further verifications. On the other hand, many studies collected real-time information on occupant behavior by taking advantage of advanced occupant recognition approaches. Sayed, Himeur and Bensaali [49] comprehensively reviewed common occupancy detection approaches such as sensors, mobile technologies, smart meters and cameras. Rueda et al. [47] systematically reviewed prevailing analytical, knowledge-based and machine-learning models used to estimate occupancy information. The occupant recognition approaches offer more reliable results than predictive models. The advent of occupant recognition approaches gave researchers opportunities to understand real-time occupant behavior, and more importantly, design control strategies responding to occupant behavior. Beyond the detection of occupant behavior, many studies explored the possibility of using OCC strategies for minimizing building energy consumption. Esrafilian-Najafabadi and Haghighat [15] systematically reviewed the application of various OCC strategies. Anand, Cheong and Sekhar [6] highlighted the weaknesses and limitations of OCC strategies. The following studies have developed OCC strategies for reducing building or HVAC energy consumption. For instance, Pang et al. [43] proposed OCC strategies for energy conservation in office buildings. The simulated results demonstrated that the strategy reduced energy consumption by between 19 % and 45 % under different situations. Peng et al. [45] established OCC strategies for reducing the energy use of a chilled beam system. The strategies were applied to 11 offices and meeting rooms, enabling energy savings between 7 % and 52 % across the entire zones, compared to the conventional schedule-based controller. Goyal, Barooah and Middelkoop [21] experimentally evaluated OCC strategies in a test zone in an educational building. It was found that the strategy yielded significant energy savings, relative to the dual-maximum baseline controller. Kitzberger, Kotik and Pröll [31] deployed an OCC strategy to a variable air volume system in two laboratory test rooms. The strategy yielded a potential reduction of electricity consumption by up to 18 % compared to the baseline controller. Esrafilian-Najafabadi and Haghighat [16] designed OCC strategies by coupling rule-based controllers with predictive models which can estimate preconditioning time and occupancy patterns. The simulation results indicated that the OCC strategies could reduce approximately 17 % of energy compared to the simple rule-based controllers. OCC strategies have also been used to reduce HVAC energy use and enhance or maintain indoor thermal comfort. Aftab et al. [2] employed OpenCV-assisted Raspberry Pi modules in an indoor space and counted the number of occupants. Afterwards, OCC strategies were established. The simulation results showed that the strategy lowered>30 % of HVAC energy consumption without compromising occupants\u2019 thermal satisfaction. Li and Chen [35] demonstrated a novel OCC strategy, which adjusted HVAC operation according to the real-time clothing level and facial skin temperature of occupants. The experimental results showed that 91 % of the subjects felt thermally comfortable. Salimi and Hammad [48] proposed an OCC strategy and estimated the performance of the strategy. The simulation results demonstrated that the strategy was able to achieve a 50 % decrease in thermal discomfort. Kim and Moon [30] empirically utilized an OCC strategy for governing the cooling condition and humidification level of a testbed. In comparison to conventional controllers, the OCC strategy could lead to a decrease in system energy consumption and thermal discomfort level. Additionally, a number of studies applied OCC strategies to mechanical ventilation systems for guaranteeing or enhancing IAQ. Lu et al. [37] performed a systematic review of recent advances and applications of CO2-based demand-controlled ventilation in commercial buildings. The review listed a number of equations, which mapped the relationship between occupancy levels, CO2 concentration and ventilation rate. Wei et al. [60] proposed an OCC controller by coupling a demand-control ventilation strategy with dynamic occupancy information, obtained by using a faster region-based conventional neural network. According to simulation results, it was realized that such a controller would significantly enhance IAQ and overcome the issue of under- or over-estimation of ventilation demand, caused by using a traditional control strategy. Further, many studies demonstrated that OCC strategy enabled energy savings of ventilation systems, whilst maintaining good IAQ. Mysen et al. [39] showed that the occupancy-density-based demand-control-ventilation, strategy, as a kind of OCC strategy, allowed a reduction of 51 % of the energy used by a ventilation-air-volume system, in comparison to the constant-air-volume system. Kong et al. [32] adopted an OCC strategy for an educational building in New York. The strategy flexibly varied the setpoint temperature of the studied room based on occupant behavior. The empirical tests indicated that compared to the schedule-based controller, the strategy offered an energy saving between 17 % and 24 %, whilst maintaining occupants\u2019 thermal comfort and IAQ at a good level. Choi et al. [11] implemented a deep vision-based energy-recovery-ventilator OCC strategy. Afterwards, the performance of the strategy was experimentally evaluated. Compared to a conventional scheduled control and CO2-based on/off control, the implemented strategy was able to maintain satisfying IAQ, whilst lowering ventilation rates by 35 %-24 % and electrical energy use by 67 %-28 %, respectively. Anand et al. [7] found that adjusting the room ventilation rate in proportion to occupancy levels could significantly save energy consumed by an investigated variable-air-volume system. Similar work can be found in Clark et al. [13]. Overall, researchers have been focusing on managing, controlling and improving the comfort and energy performance of the indoor environment. However, the enhancement of IAQ by adopting OCC strategies has received much less attention. Yang et al. [63] comprehensively reviewed how occupancy information can assist HVAC systems' operations in providing a satisfying indoor environment. It was reported that only 12.3 % of the reviewed OCC studies targeted IAQ improvement as the main control object, while most studies focused on controlling indoor air temperature. Further, OCC strategies were primarily used to control mechanical ventilation systems. 1.3 Novelty and research gaps According to a review of the literature presented above, it was found that studies used to collect occupant behavior and then design OCC strategies for controlling or improving indoor thermal comfort, energy use and IAQ. A research gap realized then was that OCC strategies were typically used to assist the operations of mechanical ventilation systems, instead of natural ventilation systems. A very limited number of studies have applied OCC strategies to natural ventilation systems. This is because, indeed, mechanical ventilation systems can be reliable, controllable and energy-efficient. However, mechanical ventilation systems can be unaffordable and even unavailable under certain situations, while natural ventilation is always free. Further, natural ventilation allows an exchange of air mass and heat between indoor and outdoor environment. It was envisioned that a careful utilization of natural ventilation effects, achieved by properly changing window openness according to occupant behavior, can maintain or improve IAQ and indoor thermal comfort and even avoid the use of mechanical ventilation systems, without causing significant energy waste. However, the feasibility of employing OCC strategies in natural ventilation systems for improving IAQ but also thermal comfort and energy use was not fully reported and investigated. 1.4 Research aim and objectives The aim of the work is to develop an Occupant-Centric Heating and Natural Ventilation Control (OCHNVC) strategy for indoor thermal comfort, air quality and energy management of a case study building. To achieve the research aim, three research objectives were proposed. Firstly, real-time profiles of occupant behavior and window opening in a case study building were collected by using an integrated artificial intelligence (AI)-powered camera and deep vision algorithms. Secondly, a parametric simulation study was conducted for the provision of big data. Based on the data, predictive data were established for illustrating the thermal comfort, energy and IAQ responses of the studied building to different levels of occupant behavior and window opening behavior. Thirdly, an OCHNVC, tailored to the case study lecture room, was proposed and applied to the studied room. The strategy was composed of three sub-controllers: flexible on\u2013off controller, heating setpoint controller and window openness controller. The flexible on\u2013off controller governed the status of the heating system according to the real-time occupant presence behavior. The heating setpoint controller determined the optimal heating setpoint that balanced the trade-off between occupants\u2019 thermal satisfaction and energy used by a heating system. The window openness controller optimized the openness of windows for maintaining IAQ and reducing energy waste. The performance of the strategy was evaluated by using a building-energy-simulation tool and compared to a conventional control strategy. 2 Methodology The following subsections summarie the methodology of the work.

During the studied period, the outdoor air temperature ranged from 2.4 °C to 10 °C. Fig. 1 shows the outdoor and indoor environment of the studied room. The internal dimension of the room was 13 m in length by 7.5 m in width by 2.5 m in height. The U-values of the interior floor, ceiling, wall and windows were 1.1 W/m2K, 1.1 W/m2K, 0.26 W/m2K and 1.6 W/m2K, respectively. The infiltration rate was 1 air change per hour. These values were obtained and estimated from the available CAD drawings. The British building regulations CIBSE Guide A Environmental Design [12] state that in winter, it is necessary to maintain indoor air temperatures between 19 °C and 21 °C to ensure occupants\u2019 thermal satisfaction, productivity and well-being. During heating seasons, heating would be provided by using 4 large radiators located below the window openings. The CIBSE Guide A Environmental Design also stated that indoor CO2 concentrations should not exceed 1000 ppm to guarantee occupants\u2019 health conditions. However, the room was not equipped with any mechanical ventilation system. Therefore, the adjustment of the IAQ of the room totally relied on natural ventilation via manually opening windows. For the room, closing windows when heating is offered could avoid a leak of interior heat and achieve conservation of heating energy, while consequently, the demand for acceptable IAQ was not fulfilled and vice versa. Under such a situation, implementing a specific OCHNVC strategy could significantly lessen the building\u2019s dependency on heating energy and carbon footprints without sacrificing occupants\u2019 thermal comfort and IAQ. 2.2 Collection of real-time profiles by using AI-powered cameras for detection and recognition AI-powered cameras have been developed and reported in our previous studies for the detection and identification of occupant heat gains [54], equipment heat gains [59], and opening of windows [56]. In this study, the vision-based detection method was implemented in the studied lecture room during the winter period. Fig. 2 shows the process of producing real-time profiles of occupant heat gains and opening of windows. The vision-based detector collects information on occupant behavior regarding their presence, number and activity. The collected information is then converted to a real-time profile of heat gains from occupants, based on the values provided in the CIBSE guidelines for different occupancy activities (CIBSE, 2015). The vision-based detection method can also identify the status of each window and generates individual profiles of the window openness. The vision-based detection method employed the classification-based algorithm convolutional neural networks (CNN), which is suitable for developing detectors for the indoor environment. The development and evaluation of individual detectors for occupancy activities are fully detailed in [55] and windows in [56]. The detection method's development involved pre-processing and preparing the data (images) for training the vision-based model. Images of occupants and windows in buildings were obtained from online sources such as Google Images and used as training and testing datasets. The training dataset images were manually labelled using the LabelImg tool. Fig. 2 shows an example of one of the training dataset images manually labeled for the model training. This typically involved drawing bounding boxes around the selected regions of interest, such as the occupant and open window gaps. In most cases, an image will have multiple regions of interest and assigned labels. Similar to previous works, the model was trained using the TensorFlow tool, which provides pre-trained models to be used through a transfer learning approach. The Faster R-CNN (With Inception V2) was selected through the assessment of the different models available. 2.3 Description of the parametric simulation study As mentioned above, this paper will develop a heating setpoint controller that could balance the trade-off relationship between occupants\u2019 thermal satisfaction and heating energy consumption. Further, a window openness controller would be established for managing IAQ. The development of such controllers required predictive models that could forecast occupants\u2019 thermal satisfaction, energy consumption and IAQ with given inputs. As the advent and booming application of data-driven black-box models [8,18] and particularly artificial neural networks (ANNs) [62,38,1], the study selected ANN models as predictive models for forecasting occupants\u2019 thermal satisfaction, energy consumption and IAQ. Following the similar methodological approaches in our previous work [58], this study created 46 scenarios for generating data, which were used to develop, train and test the predictive models. Table 1 presents a detailed description of the scenarios. Further, the soundness and accuracy of the models required further investigation. Hence, as shown in Table 2 , 8 scenarios were also produced for generating verification datasets. The prediction accuracy of the developed models would be assessed on the verification datasets. The profiles used in all scenarios are plotted in Fig. 3 . This work employed the building energy simulation tool IES Virtual Environment (VE) to acquire the performance data of the studied building. The robustness of IES VE was examined in previous studies [50,51]. IES VE is able to quickly investigate the interactions between buildings and their micro-climates and conveniently produce the performance data of the studied buildings. Recently, IES VE has released a powerful tool, Python Application Programming Interface (API) package. It allows IES VE to efficiently communicate with other software programs and easily set up and manage simulation parameters. We found this API extremely helpful in automating repetitive work in the parametric study. By writing many loop and assignment commands in the package, the IES VE was capable of automatically conducting simulations in turn. Afterwards, the operation data from simulations were exported to Excel sheets and then processed, cleaned and mixed in the Anaconda Spyder platform. By doing so, tidy data were ready for being used in the development of predictive models. 2.4 Development of predictive models The inputs, outputs and architecture of the developed three predictive models are demonstrated in Fig. 4 . There were four types of inputs to the models: local weather conditions, real-time behaviour, controlling variable and indoor conditions. In the previous work [58], similar inputs were used to forecast room heating and cooling load as well as the level of occupants\u2019 thermal satisfaction. We further conducted a thermal-dynamic analysis of the investigated room and noticed that there existed strong relationships between the inputs and outputs of the models. The strong relationships between them enabled effective and accurate predictions in turn, which would be shown in section 3.2. The training, validation and testing of the models were conducted in MATLAB Neural Network Fitting Tool GUI (Graphical User Interface). 2.5 Occupant-centric heating and natural ventilation control strategy This study proposed an OCHNVC strategy for simultaneously improving indoor thermal comfort, energy performance and indoor air quality. The strategy was composed of three sub-controllers: flexible on\u2013off controller (Controller 1), heating setpoint controller (Controller 2) and window openness controller (Controller 3). Fig. 5 demonstrates how the controllers worked. 2.5.1 Flexible on\u2013off controller As can be seen from Fig. 5, the flexible on\u2013off controller turned heating systems on to meet occupants\u2019 thermal demands when the AI-powered cameras found occupants were within the investigated room. When the investigated room was found to be vacant, the flexible on\u2013off controller turned off the heating systems to reduce the energy used by the systems and extend their lifespan. In practice, this controller will be set to a minimum temperature instead of fully off to avoid freezing of the space but it was simplified in this study. 2.5.2 Window openness controller The window openness controller was used to maintain IAQ whilst reducing unnecessary heat leakage and lost, thereby achieving indoor energy conservation. This study assumed the studied room had been equipped with hypothetical actuators that could adjust the window openness. Selecting a proper control policy for the window openness controller can be the key to lowering heating energy consumption whilst keeping indoor CO2 concentrations below 1000 ppm. This study proposed five types of window openness controllers with different control policies, as shown in Table 3 . The performance of using each control policy would be evaluated and reported. The controller Types 01\u201303 were based on if-then rules. The controller Types 01\u201302 controller governed the window openness according to the status (presence/absence) of occupants. The controller Type 03 managed the window openness based on the predicted levels of CO2 concentrations. The controller Types 04\u201305 controller adjusted the window openness according to occupancy. Fig. 6 depicts the profiles of window openness of each control policy. 2.5.3 Heating setpoint controller The heating setpoint controller was used to lower heating energy consumption without compromising occupants\u2019 thermal satisfaction. This was achieved by applying a determined optimal heating setpoint temperature that could balance the trade-off relationship between the heating energy consumption and predicted mean votes obtained by using the predictive models. A heating setpoint controller was developed in the previous work [58]. In this work, the energy-comfort performance of a setpoint temperature was evaluated by using the d setpoint as shown in Eq. (1). In the equation, the term PPD was the percentage of people dissatisfied. (1) d setpo int = Heating E n e r g y + PPD 2 This study used the predicted mean votes as the comfort metric. Further, it was observed that; Eq. (1) was not able to fully represent the energy-comfort performance of a setpoint temperature. The heating energy consumption of the studied room was between 0 kW and 50 kW, and the predicted mean votes were between −2 to 2. As can be seen from Eq. (1), the energy-comfort performance of a setpoint temperature was significantly influenced by the heating energy consumption, while slightly influenced by predicted mean votes. In other words, the heating energy consumption and predicted mean votes have uneven impacts on the energy-comfort performance of a setpoint temperature. This issue can be solved by employing a normalized objective function [33,61]. As a result of using a normalized objective function, both the heating energy consumption and predicted mean votes shared the same weights contributing to the energy-comfort performance of setpoint temperatures. The normalized objective function is shown in Eq. (2). The subscripts max and m in of the normalized energy-comfort metric d setpoint , n were the maximum and minimum values of the variables in the historical datasets, respectively. As a result of doing so, both heating setpoint temperatures and predicted mean votes lied in the same zone between zero and one. (2) d setpo int , n = Heating E n e r g y - Heating E n e r g y min Heating E n e r g y max - Heating E n e r g y min 2 + PMV - PMV min PMV max - PMV min 2 The meaning of the normalized energy-comfort metric d setpoint , n can be illustrated by using a Pareto-front plot, as shown in Fig. 7 . In Fig. 7, a number of individual feasible heating setpoints are shown. The coordinates of setpoints were obtained by using the established predictive models. The reliability of the predictive models will be presented in the following section. As can be seen from the figure, the predicted heating energy consumption increased as window openness ratios increased. Besides, as the heating setpoint temperatures increased, the predicted mean votes declined. The original point represented an ideal status, where heating energy consumption was zero and occupants were satisfied with the indoor environment ( PMV =0). The distance d setpoint , n between a heating setpoint and the original point would quantify the energy-comfort performance of the setpoint. Among all feasible setpoints, the one with the lowest d setpoint , n was selected as the best heating setpoint. 2.6 Case setup This study established 10 Cases, as shown in Table 4 , for showing the advantages of applying the proposed OCHNVC strategy. In Cases 01\u201302, the conventional control strategy was used. The conventional control strategy was composed of three controllers: fixed-time on\u2013off controller (heating offered from 06:30\u201318:30, will be shown in Fig. 10), fixed setpoint temperature controller (heating setpoints equal to 19/21 °C from 06:30\u201318:30, will be shown in Fig. 10), and occupant-driven window openness controller (where occupants were free to open/close windows, the profile was shown in Fig. 2). The purpose of establishing Cases 01\u201305 was to evaluate the benefits of using the flexible on\u2013off controller and heating setpoint controller. Specifically, a conventional window openness controller was used in Cases 01\u201305. This was achieved by using a profile of real-time window openness ratio, obtained by using the AI-powered cameras. Hence, Cases 01\u201305 evaluated the performance of flexible on\u2013off controller and heating setpoint controller, when occupants\u2019 were free to open windows. The reason for establishing Cases 06\u201310 was to investigate the effectiveness of using the window openness controller. 3 Results This part presented the results of the study, including the detection method, developed models, optimized heating profiles, as well as the improvement of heating energy performance, thermal comfort and IAQ obtained by using the proposed controllers. 3.1 Deep vision detection and recognition Using the graphics processing unit (GPU) NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080, the deep vision model was trained until it converged, with a minimum loss below 0.02. Example snapshots of the detection and recognition are shown in Fig. 8 (a). As observed, the deep vision model could accurately and reliably detect when windows were open during the presence of multiple occupants. However, further work is still required to enhance its performance, mainly when a person obstructs the window, which impacts the detection. Video 1 shows an example of detection and recognition in the lecture room. Fig. 8(b) presents the generated DLIP of the opening patterns for the selected windows in the lecture room, which can then be inputted into the OCHNVC framework. The DLIP from the experimental tests was compared with the actual observation profile or ground truth. As observed, the generated DLIP still alternates between the values of the window profile schedule, indicating a prediction error. Therefore, further improvements are required to enhance the detection model's accuracy, reliability, and stability. 3.2 Development of predictive models Fig. 9 compares the coefficient of determination (R2) of the developed predictive models on training, validation, test and verification datasets. As can be seen, all predictive models achieved R2 higher than 0.94 on the training, validation and test datasets. Specifically, the predictive models 1 and 2 also had a high R2 on the verification data. This indicated that the predicted heating energy and IAQ levels were close to the simulated ones. Thus, the predictive models 1 and 2 were sound. The predictive model 3 had a slightly lower, but still acceptable R2. This meant that the model should be further improved in future works. In a word, after examining the performance of the developed three models, it was found that the models were able to give reliable and accurate prediction results for the OCHNVC strategy. 3.3 Controlled profile of heating setpoint temperature The profiles of heating setpoint temperature during four day period in the Cases 01\u201305 are shown in Fig. 10. In Cases 01\u201302, heating was provided from 06:30 to 18:30. In Cases 03\u201304, as a result of linking the occupants\u2019 presence to the heating system, heating was intermittently provided and turned off when occupants were not within the investigated room. In Case 05, the proposed controller determined a dynamic heating setpoint temperature that can further improve indoor thermal comfort. 3.4 Benefits of using the proposed controller This subsection analyzed and discussed the performance of the proposed occupant-centric heating and natural ventilation control strategy. The benefits of using the sub-controllers, i.e. flexible on\u2013off controller, heating setpoint controller and window openness controller, were separately presented. 3.4.1 Benefits of using the flexible on\u2013off controller Fig. 11 compares the heating energy consumption in Cases 01\u201304 during four day period. The Cases 01\u201305 shared the same profile of window openness that was obtained from using the AI-powered detection cameras. The heating energy consumption in Cases 01 and 02 consumed 158 KWh and 221 KWh, respectively. Cases 03 and 04 consumed less energy than Cases 01 and 02. This was because the proposed flexible on\u2013off controller intelligently turned off heating systems to avoid unnecessary heat leakage and waste and thus save heating energy consumption. Further, the flexible on\u2013off controller in the Case 05 offered a saving of heating energy consumption between 52.9 % and 57.6 %, relative to Cases 01\u201302. 3.4.2 Benefits of using the heating setpoint controller Fig. 12 compares absolute predicted mean votes (aPMV) in Cases 01\u201305. The aPMV was calculated by averaging predicted mean votes only when occupants were within the studied room. The aPMVs of the Cases 01 and 02 were 0.34 and 0.14, respectively. The aPMVs of Cases 03 and 04 were much the same as the ones of Cases 01 and 02. This was because, in this study, the flexible on\u2013off controller only switched on/off the heating system, thus having very limited influences on indoor thermal comfort. The aPMV of Case 05 was 0.26, lower than that of Case 03 but higher than that of Case 04. Compared toCase 01 and 02, the heating setpoint controller enhanced thermal comfort by up to 23.5 %. 3.4.3 Benefits of using the window openness controller Fig. 13 shows a comparison of indoor CO2 concentrations during four day period in Cases 01\u201310. Cases 01\u201305 shared the same profile of real-time window openness ratio. As can be seen, the indoor CO2 concentrations were larger than 1000 ppm most of the time, with peaks over even 3000 ppm. In Case 01\u201305, indoor CO2 concentrations were below 1000 ppm for only 59.7 % of the time that occupants were within the studied room. Thus, in such a situation, occupants could suffer from severe health issues caused by poor IAQ. The Type 01 control policy in Case 06 was able to keep CO2 concentrations below 1000 ppm only on the 2nd and 3rd day, but hardly did so on the 1st and 4th day. The Type 02 control policy in Case 07 did control CO2 concentrations lower than 1000 ppm for the four days, while the cost was high energy consumption. Noticeably, the CO2 concentrations in Case 08, where Type 03 control policy was adopted, were higher than 1000 ppm during the 1st, 2nd and 4th day, respectively. An investigation was specifically set up in order to find the reason behind it. It was found that this was a result of inaccurate CO2 concentrations, obtained by using the developed CO2 predictive model. Although the model indeed yielded high prediction accuracy over training, validation, test and even verification datasets, the model still encountered the problem of poor prediction performance over new datasets. This suggested a careful application of data-driven models. Hence, future works shall also be focused on examining and enhancing the reliability of the CO2 predictive model. Feasible solutions to this problem were adding more datasets and applying more advanced and effective predictive models. In Cases 09\u201310, the ratios of window openness were a function of the occupant heat gains. From Fig. 13, it was noticed that the indoor CO2 concentrations in Case 09 were lower than 1000 ppm during the four days. Additionally, the CO2 concentrations on the 1st, 2nd and 3rd days were below 700 ppm, yet, at the expense of a leak of indoor heat and high heating energy use. Moreover, the Type 05 control policy in Case 10 succeeded in maintaining indoor CO2 concentrations below 1000 ppm for 89.2 % of the time when the room was occupied, except for a few moments that CO2 concentrations slightly exceeded 1000 ppm. Further, such control policy enabled energy conservation on the 1st, 2nd and 3rd days. This explains why the heating energy consumption of Case 10 was much lower than that of Case 09, as presented in Fig. 14 . In a word, the occupant-centric heating control policy Type 05 was capable of maintaining IAQ within the required levels but also lessening unnecessary leakage and waste of indoor heat, thereby achieving indoor energy conservation. Hence, the Type 05 control policy was found to be the best control policy in comparison to the other four control policies. 3.5 Benefits of using the occupant-centric heating and natural ventilation control policy Fig. 14 compares the performance of the 10 Cases. Flexible on\u2013off controllers, heating setpoint controllers and the most energy-efficient window openness controllers with the control policy Type 05 were applied to Case 10. In comparison to Case 01 (158kWh) and 02 (221 kWh), the proposed controllers in Case 10 (157 kWh) enabled a reduction of heating energy consumption between 0.6 % and 29.0 %. At the same time, the level of indoor thermal comfort of Case 10 was 0.14, lowered by between 0 % (Case 01, PMV: 0.34) and 58.8 % (Case 02, PMV: 0.14). Further, in Cases 01 and 02, the indoor CO2 concentrations were under 1000 ppm for only 59.7 % of the time that occupants were within the studied room. The proposed controller in Case 10 was able to maintain indoor CO2 concentrations below 1000 ppm for 89.2 % of the time that occupants were within the studied room. In a word, the proposed OCHNVC strategy achieved a simultaneous improvement of indoor thermal comfort, energy performance and indoor air quality. 4 Discussion AI-powered cameras have a great potential to be used in real practice. This is because first they only consumed large computational resources during the training and developing stages, while very few in the deployment stage. Second, all the AI-powered cameras would share the same set of deep-learning networks, without many modifications, which would save lots of resources if they were used in different environments. Third, the software and hardware that AI-powered cameras rely on have matured considerably in recent decades. The micropython-based, Rasberry PI panels and other modules can easily load AI-powered cameras for daily use. That\u2019s one reason why AI-powered cameras have been widely used in different situations: e.g. metro stations, car parks, automatic-driving and so on, for different identification tasks. This paper showed how AI-powered cameras could aid the operation of heating systems. The above results indicated that the OCHNVC strategy was able to improve indoor thermal comfort, energy performance and indoor air quality. The following discussed the limitations of the study and delivered recommendations about how to solve them in future works. Firstly, attention shall be paid to further investigating and raising the soundness of the predictive model that forecasted indoor CO2 concentrations. Although the developed CO2 concentration predictive models achieved excellent performance on training, validation, test and verification datasets (R2 > 0.94), it still yielded inaccurate prediction results in Case 08, where the Type 03 control policy was adopted. The inaccurate prediction results caused the Type 03 ventilation control policy failed to keep indoor CO2 concentrations below 1000 ppm eventually. Therefore, the effectiveness of the Type 03 control policy shall be assessed in future works. To overcome this issue, more advanced predictive models may be taken into consideration, such as recurrent neural network [53], principal component analysis and partial least square regression model [29], deterministic and identified models [44], etc. Secondly, the reliability of the OCHNVC strategy was heavily dependent on the quality of the predictive models. Such models were purely data-driven, thereby having a fast computation speed and requiring low computation time and resources. Yet, their performance in a real built environment was not fully reported. It was necessary to empirically conduct on-site measurements. Afterwards, a comparison shall be made between the measured and predicted results for examining and analyzing their performance. Further, such models were tailored to the investigated room. It is very common each building have unique design characteristics, thermal envelope, macro-and micro-evnironments. Hence, such models should be calibrated or adjusted before being applied to other buildings. Thirdly, this study proved the feasibility and evaluated the advantages of using the proposed control strategy on the basis of using a building energy simulation tool. Future works would focus on deploying the control strategy to real buildings and different types. In addition, the proposed method relies on automated natural ventilation; future work should also carry out a cost-benefit analysis of retrofitting buildings with such technologies. Another research direction is finding alternative solutions for incorporating the proposed approach in buildings with manually operated windows. This can be potentially achieved by incorporating alert systems or sign boards in the room which can advise or inform building users and managers. 5 Conclusions and future works Recently, various occupant-centric control strategies have been developed. However, very few studies employed the OCHNVC strategy. This study examined the feasibility of using a proposed OCHNVC strategy for achieving a simultaneous improvement of indoor thermal comfort, building energy performance and indoor air quality. In the study, firstly, AI-powered detection cameras were introduced for the identification of the real-time behavior of occupants and window opening in an investigated building and the generation of profiles. Secondly, a parametric simulation study was done. The data from simulation results were used to develop predictive models that forecasted the indoor predicted mean votes, heating energy consumption and carbon dioxide concentrations based on different levels of occupant behavior and window opening behavior. Thirdly, an OCHNVC strategy was proposed, which was composed of three sub-controllers: flexible on\u2013off controller, heating setpoint controller and window openness controller. The flexible on\u2013off controller governed the status of the heating system according to the real-time occupant presence. The heating setpoint controller determined the optimal heating setpoint that balanced the trade-off between occupants\u2019 thermal satisfaction and energy used by a heating system. The window openness controller adjusted the openness of windows for maintaining IAQ, reducing unnecessary indoor heat leakage and waste and achieving energy conservation. The performance of the proposed controller was examined. In comparison to the conventional control strategy, the controller could lower heating energy consumption by between 0.6 % and 29.0 % and improve the level of indoor thermal comfort by between 0 % and 58.8 %. The conventional window control strategy only maintained indoor CO2 concentrations below 1000 ppm for 59.7 % of the time that occupants were within the studied room, while the proposed controller could do so for 89.2 % of the time. Future work shall focus on integrating such controllers with traditional HVAC controllers and experimentally test the effectiveness, reliability and benefits of using the proposed control strategy. Further, we will improve the proposed control policies by considering the opening of windows as a resultant-behaviour influenced by not only IAQ, but also occupants\u2019 thermal satisfaction. It should also be noted that our control strategy did\u2019t keep CO2 less than 1000 ppm all the time. A combination of real-time behaviour and more advanced machine-learning-algorithm control strategies can solve that problem. Concerning the vision-based detection strategy, further work is required to fully integrate the approach with the control and HVAC system. Further development of the deep vision approach and algorithm are also required to ensure that missed, and no detections can be minimized.

        "dc:description": "Recently, Occupant-Centric Control (OCC) strategies have gained mounting interest. Previous studies made use of OCC strategies for adjusting the operation of heating/cooling systems, improving indoor thermal comfort and governing mechanical ventilation systems. However, a very limited number of studies have applied OCC strategies to natural ventilation systems. Further, the feasibility of establishing OCC strategies for controlling indoor thermal comfort, energy use and specifically air quality has received much less attention and investigation. This paper presented an Occupant-Centric Heating and Natural Ventilation Control (OCHNVC) strategy for enhancing indoor thermal comfort, building energy performance and indoor air quality. Firstly, real-time profiles of occupant behavior and window opening in a case study building were collected using artificial intelligence (AI)-powered cameras and deep vision algorithms. Secondly, shallow artificial-neural-networks predictive models were established for forecasting the responses of the studied building to different levels of occupant behavior and window opening behavior. Thirdly, an OCHNVC strategy tailored to the studied room was proposed and applied to the studied room. The strategy could lower heating energy consumption by between 0.6 % and 29.0 % and improve the level of indoor thermal comfort by between 0 % and 58.8 %, relative to a conventional control strategy. Moreover, the conventional window control strategy only maintained indoor CO2 concentrations below 1000 ppm for 59.7 % of the period that occupants were within the studied room, while the proposed controller could do so for 89.2 % of the period. Future works shall focus on experimentally deploying the strategy to real buildings and evaluating its performance.",
