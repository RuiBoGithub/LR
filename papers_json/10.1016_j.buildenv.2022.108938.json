Data Science Institute, Imperial College London South Kensington Campus London United Kingdom Rule-Based Control (RBC) and Model Predictive Control (MPC) have been traditionally used to control building heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. They, however, present shortcomings when faced with efficiently controlling these systems at a larger level. Reinforcement Learning (RL) has recently emerged as a viable alternative, showing promising results compared to previous methods, but still having some difficulties with untrained situations or sudden changes. CntrlDA is our proposal on improving the RL formulation by coupling it with data assimilation (DA), a technique commonly used in numerical weather prediction. Our battery of experiments, in a building simulation environment, shows that training a RL control agent with DA and external data, leads to better performance than training the agent using only the simulation data. The RL control agent with DA maintains the temperature range 15.6% more often than the RL control agent without DA. It is also shown that by including a DA stage in the control process, the agent better deals with unexpected events (which are common in real-life systems and particularly in building energy control scenarios). We show that it maintains the range 15.4% more often than the system without DA with no significant added cost of resources.

It is well-known that most of this energy loss is due to operating HVAC systems/equipment [2]. In particular, the selection of optimal setpoints (the target temperature that the HVAC system tries to maintain) and deadbands (the range around the setpoint at which the system is not required to respond) can lead to energy savings of up to 35% [3]. More formal motivations for reducing energy consumption include: \u2022 Climate change (for example, the EU Green Deal [4] aims to make Europe climate neutral by 2050). \u2022 Ageing infrastructure (which leads to less efficient and more wasteful buildings, accelerating the need to optimise their energy usages). \u2022 Economic growth in developing countries (meaning more building and hence more energy consumption and CO 2 emissions). \u2022 Fiscal savings (as energy wastage translates to lost money for either/or owners of buildings and businesses that rent them). Building thermal comfort can be addressed in two ways: passively and actively. With the first approach, new materials can be introduced at the construction and retrofitting stages (such as in [5]). Our proposal aligns with the second approach, in which pieces of equipment (such as ventilation systems) act on controlling the indoor conditions. RBC and MPC are the two classical approaches used to control buildings\u2019 operation and thus to manage their energy consumption in a (semi-) automatic way. However, while successful in many aspects, those approaches have their limitations, particularly regarding their generalisation and scaling to larger and more complex scenarios. RL, an Artificial Intelligence technique, has proven to be a promising technology for efficient building control [6] and a convenient alternative to those classical methods, since it has the potential to be model-free and operate in open-loop even under unspecified conditions and for longer time horizons. When neural networks are used to estimate value functions or represent the policy of the agent [7], Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) leverages RL and allows to solve complex control [8] and decision-making [9] tasks. DRL has also been applied to building control problems, yielding promising results yet in relatively simple scenarios with reduced observation and action spaces [10,11]. One of the main limitations of building energy control systems is the inability to properly deal with unexpected events (which in our case would take the form of extreme temperature changes). This is important because unexpected events are not taken into account in many systems, yet in real life they do occur and have consequences. To fill this gap, in this work, we introduce CntrlDA, a novel control model able to ingest and assimilate new information from sensors and adjust the controlling agent to face unexpected events. It integrates a DA [12] step in the learning and testing processes of a RL setup. DA is the process of optimally combining time-distributed data with a dynamic model to approximate the true state of a physical system at a particular time. In order to improve numerical forecast results, DA incorporates observational data into a prediction model [13]. Multiple data modifications are made during a single run of DA to bring the simulation/forecast output into an agreement with the most recent observed data [14]. When there is not enough time to restart a run from the beginning with new data in operational forecasting, DA should allow for real-time data use to improve predictions [15]. This requires the implementation of effective strategies for integrating DA with the forecasting model [16]. Regarding the implementation, in this paper, we chose to extend Sinergym [17] (an open-source building simulation and control framework for training reinforcement learning agents) by means of including a DA module named Best Linear Unbiased Estimator (BLUE) [13] which is well known to be not computationally expensive. Synergym is compatible with EnergyPlus models and allows to implement python-based controllers, facilitating reproducibility of experiments and generalisation to multiple scenarios. The rest of this paper is organised as follows: Section 2 introduces the necessary background to this work in terms of RL and the software and tools we use, providing the theoretical and technical grounding for our experiments. Section 3 describes CntrlDA and how DA is incorporated in the RL framework to deal with unexpected events. Sections 4 and 5 describe our experiments\u2019 setup and the results. For this, agents both with and without DA are trained and tested in the environment, and we compare the results. Our experimentation includes work on expanding the system to real-life scenarios: how an agent performs in a setting where there are occasional extreme changes in temperature. The work concludes by summarising our results and pointing towards possible improvements to CntrlDA. 1.1 Related work We explore here the three main computational approaches used in the control of building HVAC systems: RBC, MPC and RL. We discuss the advantages and limitations of the first two methods and the motivations leading to the successful adoption of the third. The section concludes with a description of the Sinergym library [17] (which we used in this work). RBC [18] is a widely-used and straightforward method for managing a system with minimal interaction from humans. It is based on a set of principles, which in its most basic form comprises of [19]: a rule base (a list of rules such as: \u201cif X then Y , else Z \u201d), an inference engine (which takes action based on the rules and system input), and a working memory (which stores temporary data used by the inference engine). RBC has been used in many areas such as manufacturing [20], medicine [21] and energy control [22]. Regarding this last domain, another example is a rule-based controller for a residential hot water system [23]. The rules in this system are very concise; based on the current temperature and the temperature thresholds, either the system attempts to adjust the temperature, or it does nothing. This could equally be extended to many more levels, with more temperature ranges resulting in a rule being triggered. In a way, the power of RBC is its simplicity. Another relevant example is the use of RBC in smart grids. In [24], several rules for controlling the energy settings are proposed, and then through optimisation, an optimal set of rules is chosen to obtain a final rule base. This optimisation considers the environment, and by modifying the set of rules, the system can deal with sudden changes in the environment. Later on, we will discuss the importance of the energy system being able to do this. MPC is an optimal control algorithm popular in the optimisation of HVAC systems. The three core principles of MPC are as follows: a dynamics model of the process, a cost function (related to the future behaviour of the process) and an optimisation algorithm that uses the control input to minimise the cost function. It is also common to add constraints to the system, such as boundaries for variables to stay within. With all of that, it is possible to obtain optimal control inputs (i.e., inputs to the system, such as heating settings in our HVAC system). MPC proceeds by taking the system\u2019s current state at time t , and evaluating the cost function for different possible control inputs for future states at times t + 1 to t + n . From these evaluations, the best trajectory is found from the current state by finding the sequence of control inputs that minimises the cost function. However, only the first step of this trajectory is actually implemented. This process is repeated for the state at time t + 1 , giving a new sequence of optimal control inputs. This sequence constantly evolves through time. This process is discussed in the context of HVAC system control in [25]. The building model (i.e. the dynamics model) takes in state estimates x ˆ (obtained using a simulation engine) and weather disturbance forecast d ˆ , and produces future state predictions x . Taking into account any constraints, the cost function is then optimised to obtain control actions sequence u (such as heating settings) such that the energy usage is minimised and the output y (room temperature) is maintained within a given \u201ccomfort interval\u201d. The first control action of the sequence is initiated, and the process then repeats. We would like to highlight here that the idea of a comfort interval is essential in optimising an HVAC system; if that was not there, switching off all equipment would probably be the more energy-efficient action. In fact, the controllers\u2019 ultimate objective is better described as minimising the energy consumption while maintaining the comfort within a range. Another example of MPC applied to HVAC is [26]. The authors noted that one of the bottlenecks of MPC occurs in calculating possible future trajectories, with solutions not being diverse enough or not looking forward enough into the future. They suggest using data parallelisation to simulate many possible trajectories for the future building states. Their proposed algorithm chooses an optimised plan regarding minimising energy consumption and maintaining a comfortable temperature. This paper focused on a specific building, considered the weather forecast and building occupancy, and reported an average energy savings of approximately 20%, with maximum savings of 40%, compared to rule-based control. This result is not surprising as MPC often outperforms RBC because it is \u201cpredictive in nature and hence able to take future disturbances\u201d [27]. However, it also has its disadvantages (which naturally arise from MPC being more complex than RBC): it is necessary to have an accurate dynamics model, and there is a high computational cost for both running simulations of trajectories and performing the optimisation. Because of that, MPC is not scalable to very large problems, which poses a problem when wanting to expand building energy control to many sites, such as in a smart grid. RL (further described in the next section) has been the most successful proposal to deal with this issue and better handle complex and data-heavy problems with large state space. While RL is not a new technique, its coupling with neural networks (namely DRL) has lately led to a fruitful area of research and applications in the control domain. As expected, RL has also been used to control HVAC systems. For instance, [28] uses a DRL for HVAC control such that the amount of energy used is minimised and the indoor temperature is maintained within a range. To do so, a reward function is used balancing the optimisation of the two goals, with the first part related to the energy cost, and the second part to the temperature constraints. It uses an environment consisting of an EnergyPlus [29] building simulation model of a real building with a HVAC system. Further examples of the application of RL to HVAC control are: [30] to control a radiant heating system, [11] to predict demand response, and the many cases listed in [6,10]. In addition to this, several tools have been proposed for building control using RL (e.g. Gym-Eplus [30], RL testbed for EnergyPlus [31], BOPTEST-gym [32], Energym [33] and Sinergym [17]). 2 Preliminaries This section will briefly cover some of the aspects relevant to our work, including RL, DRL, a description of the Sinergym library [17] (which we used in this work) and how RL is implemented in it. 2.1 Reinforcement learning RL is a machine learning training method that rewards desired behaviours and/or punishes undesired ones [34]. Its goal is to learn good policies for sequential decision problems by optimising a cumulative future reward signal. Fig. 1 provides a concise depiction of an RL setting. The agent learns which actions it should take at given states through interaction with the environment and based on the possible rewards. This is called policy π , which can be deterministic or stochastic [34]. If the policy is deterministic, it gives the action a to be taken at a given state s : π θ ( a | s ) = a . If the policy is stochastic, it gives the probability of taking action a given the state s : π θ ( a | s ) = p ( a | s ) . In the first case, the action is given directly as an output; while in the second, the output is a distribution of probabilities π θ ( s , a ) and the action with the highest probability is chosen. The process of how the agent learns is defined by a Q-value [35], Q π ( s , a ) , which defines how good an action a is for a given state s , when following a policy π . The value of Q π ( s , a ) at time t is updated using the Bellman equation: (2.1) Q ( s t , a t ) ← ( 1 − γ ) ⋅ Q ( s t , a t ) + γ ⋅ ( R t + λ ⋅ max a Q ( s t + 1 , a ) ) , where γ denotes a learning rate, R t is the immediate reward and λ is the discount factor [36]. In order to explore enough state\u2013action pairs to allow for Q-value updates, one commonly follows an epsilon greedy policy where random exploration over the state space is decreased over time, and 1 − ε of the time the best action is chosen. 2.1.1 Deep reinforcement learning When neural networks are used to estimate value functions or represent the policy of an RL agent (or both), we can talk of DRL [7]. Fig. 2 shows a Deep Q-network (DQN) [37], one of the latest DRL architectures. The main difference between DQN and non-deep RL methods is how the best policy is learned. Instead of having a state and an action and outputting the Q-value for that pair, we input just the state and then receive the Q-values for each state\u2013action pair. More specifically, we see that when the agent receives state s , it is passed as input to a neural network which then outputs policy distribution π θ ( s , a ) . During training, we also have experience replay occurring: samples are stored in what is known as a replay buffer, and random samples are taken from this buffer to update the network periodically. In the example above (Fig. 2), the state s is multidimensional, θ represents the network weights, and we have four possible actions that can be taken. The highest probability action is chosen, and the cycle is then as before in RL. We note that it is through this neural network that a large state space can be dealt with, as it provides an effective way of relating the states and the policy [38]. One improvement to DQN is adding another neural network to obtain the Double Deep Q-network (DDQN) [38]. It involves the use of another neural network, called the target network. 2.2 SineRgym library environment Sinergym [17] is an open-source energy building simulation and control framework for DRL. It is a Python library and aims at creating an environment following OpenAI Gym interface for wrapping simulation engines for building control using DRL. It contains or imports all of the necessary tools for running building simulations and training a RL agent. These include: EnergyPlus [29]: Designed by the US Department of Energy, EnergyPlus is an open-source building energy simulation engine used to model both energy consumption and water use in buildings. OpenAI Gym [39]: It is an open-source python toolkit designed for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms. It contains many standardised RL environments and is compatible with numerical computational libraries such as TensorFlow. It facilitates the task of creating custom environments. Stable Baselines3 [40]: This is a set of implementations of RL algorithms, written in PyTorch. They are fully compatible and easy to use with the OpenAI Gym environments (and hence also with the Sinergym environment). Sinergym setup: This allows us to combine all information and run simulations: Sinergym creates an environment (following the OpenAI Gym interface) that wraps the EnergyPlus simulation engine and our building, weather and action space information. Use is then as with normal Gym environments, with Python. In order to train and test RL agents, the Sinergym repository also contains additional files such as: Building information: At the heart of the environment is the building file, containing information such as the number of storeys, the building materials, the layout of the building, and more. Several building layouts are available in the repository, but it is possible to use a custom one. Weather types: While the building specifics (such as area, windows, etc.) are always fixed, we may have different geographical locations where simulations can be run, with each location corresponding to a weather type. Sinergym includes three climate types (\u201cHot dry\u201d, \u201cMixed humid\u201d, and \u201cCool marine\u201d), which differ in both their average temperatures and relative humidity, providing several representative weather conditions. Their TMY3 (Typical Meteorological Year) data and classification have been extracted from [41]. Fig. 3 represents the Sinergym setup. As with any RL setting, we must have an agent that performs actions in an environment. In the current version of Sinergym, and without losing generality, it uses the Stable Baselines3 implementation of an algorithm (for example, a DQN). At each time step, the agent chooses a discrete action, and this then takes the form of an actual building control action (i.e. choosing the heating and cooling setpoints) which is passed into the environment. The environment, in this scenario, is made up of three main moving parts: \u2022 the EnergyPlus simulation engine, which takes the action as an input, \u2022 the building and weather data files which serve as inputs to the energyplus simulation engine, \u2022 the Sinergym environment that wraps all of the aforementioned parts as an OpenAI Gym environment, allows us to easily train and document standard RL algorithms. Following the inner workings of EnergyPlus, we are given as output many observations (e.g. the resulting indoor temperature), from which we can obtain both the next observed state and the reward. This information is then passed back to the agent, where a new action is selected, and the cycle repeats. Also note that if we are in training mode, updates will be made to the RL algorithm (e.g. the network weights in a DQN) before the new action selection. In case we are controlling the HVAC system of a building, the reward function is usually described as a combination of consumption and comfort given an indoor temperature T t , at time t , and power consumption p o w e r t [10,28,17]: (2.2) R t = − W ( λ E p o w e r t ) − ( 1 − W ) λ T ( max ( T t − T t l o w , 0 ) + max ( T t u p − T t , 0 ) ) where W ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] defines the relative weight between energy consumption and comfort penalty. Note that as R t is a negative number, the closer to zero, the better, and we are faced with a maximisation problem. Different environments may use different parameters for the reward (for example, giving a greater weight to comfort in a workplace building than in a data centre); users may define other reward functions which include other terms, such as CO2 emissions. However, this formulation of the reward function does not account for unexpected events. A penalty should be added whenever the controller cannot successfully deal with such a situation. We will deal with it in the next section. 3 Cntrlda: A control system with real time adjustment Let us imagine now that the real-life scenario in our building differs from that in our simulation engine. For example, instead of the 3 expected people in the office at 18:00 who would normally be the last ones there, we now have 15 people who have stayed behind for a birthday get-together. With more people in the office it perhaps feels a little warmer, and they open a window. The indoor temperature is therefore different than expected. This has not been accounted for by the simulation or the control agent, and we are not sure what will happen. This is one of the main drawbacks of existing controllers, particularly those that rely on a previous set of given rules and/or examples to learn. If a new situation appears that the control agent has not seen before, its behaviour is unclear; they simply have not learnt how to operate. In some cases, systems designers can add default rules (which might or might not be appropriate in all circumstances); in others, a simplification to the most similar case is done (which again might not always be appropriate). This section describes our approach to dealing with unexpected events by introducing and integrating a DA model [13] into Sinergym. Also, we build the system in a way that may be adjusted in the future with new data from sensors. Particularly, we introduce DA in two parts of our system: in training (to improve the agent\u2019s accuracy by modifying observations) and during testing (so forecast values can be adjusted to the real-sensor values in case they diverge). Specifically, the DA model we implemented is named BLUE [13]. This algorithm takes a model forecast value T t (i.e. the expected observation from the simulation engine): (3.1) T t = F ( T t − 1 ) , T 0 = c o n s t , and an observed value T t o (i.e. the actual observation from real-life sensors), and combines them as such: (3.2) T t a = T t + 1 1 + α ( T t o − T t ) , where T t a is the assimilated value called analysis (see Fig. 4), and α = σ o 2 / σ b 2 is the ratio of variances of the errors on the data [13,12]. There are three main cases: \u2022 The observed value is far more accurate than the forecast value: σ o ≪ σ b ⇒ α ≪ 1 ⇒ T t a ≈ T t o . \u2022 The forecast value is far more accurate than the observed value: σ b ≪ σ o ⇒ α ≫ 1 ⇒ T t a ≈ T t . \u2022 The forecast and observed values are equally accurate:: σ b ≈ σ o ⇒ α ≈ 1 ⇒ T t a ≈ 1 2 ( T t + T t o ) (i.e. the mean) . As we will see, the first and second cases are the most relevant to our work; our assimilated values will tend to move largely towards either the state (observations) value or the sensors\u2019 value due to the accuracy (i.e. the variances) of those values. Fig. 4 visually depicts this process. The forecast value T t is assimilated with the observed value T t o at each time step, and a new value T t a is computed. 3.1 Learning to deal with unexpected events The introduction of DA to our model is straightforward. Most of the process is identical to earlier, with the fundamental change in our setting occurring only at the point before our agent receives the information back from the environment. See Fig. 5 for the updated diagram. In addition to the observation given by the simulator after applying an action, let us assume we also have sensor data. We want to \u201cmerge\u201d together those two pieces of data corresponding to the same variables. So, before any state information is passed back to the agent, we assimilate the sensors data and the state using BLUE. The reward is passed back to the agent as before without any changes, and a new action is taken at the following time step (following any agent updates if applicable, for example, updating Q-network weights in a deep Q-network agent). However, what is not apparent above is that the DA is not performed at every time step (i.e. every 15 min), but rather every four times-steps (i.e. every hour). We chose to perform DA hourly as there is no huge variability in values at every time step. Note that this is tailored to our case; we could have DA being performed every minute in other settings. After the assimilation of the sensor data, the full reward function at the next time step t + 1 is therefore: (3.3) R t + 1 = − W ( λ E p o w e r t ) − ( 1 − W ) λ T × ( max ( F ( T t a ) − T t + 1 l o w , 0 ) + max ( T t + 1 u p − F ( T t a ) , 0 ) ) where, T t a is the assimilated temperature at time t and F denotes the simulation engine in Eq. (3.1). λ E and λ T are still constants for scaling the magnitudes of both terms, and W ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] is still a weight given to each contribution. 3.2 Real-time adjustment After training our agent using DA, we then want to see how it would perform with a real-time change in indoor temperature; what this means is that we now perform DA on the testing year also. Fig. 6 updates the previous diagram to add the real-time DA. This change of including DA also in the testing side, is made to both agents we have trained (i.e. with and without DA). The DA is performed at fixed time steps (for example, every hour or minute, or once per day). The building HVAC system is set up to react appropriately to the sudden change in indoor temperature. This DA is again done using BLUE, but our assumptions about the forecast and observed temperature values are now changed. Earlier, we assumed that the forecast temperature values were far more accurate than the observed values, and hence the DA led to values that were very similar to the forecast values. This has now changed; we take the observed (extreme) values to be extremely accurate, and hence the forecast values less so. To describe this, we use σ b 2 = 0 . 05 , σ o 2 = 0 . 005 , where σ b 2 is the forecast value variance, and σ o 2 is the observed value variance [13]. The CntrlDA code 1 1 Available at https://github.com/admitrewski/Building-Energy-Simulation-through-Deep-Learning.git. was developed from an older version of Synergym, adding some code changes and additional files. The trained agents can be found in the folder DQN_agents, which are then loaded in scripts DQN_with_and_without_DA.ipynb and real_time_DA.ipynb. The temperatures used for real-time DA are obtained in temp means.ipynb, and stored in mean_runs. The images corresponding to the results of the experiments are located in project_images. 4 Testing environment This section will first describe the specific environment we will be using (such as the building and action space) and then discuss how to train our model within this environment. We will run our control models and show the results in the next section. We aim to train a building controller that minimises energy consumption during operation while maintaining occupants\u2019 comfort. Building information: In our experiments, we use a commercial building (available in the Sinergym repository and widely used in the related literature); it is a one-storey, 463 m 2 , building with a fixed number of windows, doors and interior/exterior areas (see Fig. 7 for its schematic). It also includes information such as building materials, wall/window insulation, wall thickness, and building lighting/air filtration systems, all of which are essential in the upcoming simulations. The building and its surroundings (for example, its orientation: 30 degrees east of north) are fixed for all simulations. Action space: The action space, which is discrete, has ten possible actions to choose from at each time step. Matrix (4.1) lists these actions and the corresponding setpoints. The first column denotes the Discrete actions, the second denotes the Heating setpoints and the third one denotes the Cooling setpoints. (4.1) D i s c r e t e a c t i o n H e a t i n g s e t p o i n t C o o l i n g s e t p o i n t 0 15 30 1 16 29 2 17 28 3 18 27 4 19 26 5 20 25 6 21 24 7 22 23 8 22 22 9 21 21 Agent training setup: We perform all simulation runs using the \u201cHot Dry\u201d weather type and employing a DQN agent. The first step is to train the agent, and for that, the following settings and parameters are chosen: \u2022 train the agent for seven years of simulations \u2022 learning rate γ = 0 . 9 \u2022 target network Q ˆ updated every 5000 time steps \u2022 exploration rate ε decreases from 1 to 0.05 over training. The number of years to train is chosen by trial and error; fewer years see an apparent underperformance of the agent while adding more years does not seem to improve it. If anything, we see a degree of overfitting. The learning rate, target network update and exploration rate are taken from the stable baselines default parameters for a DQN. While they could be tuned to optimise performance in this setting, we use these for consistency and comparisons with later methods. We trained two agents, one without DA (called Agent no-DA) and another one including DA (Agent with-DA). For Agent with-DA, during the training, we assimilate the simulation forecast indoor temperature with a sensors data set (every 4 time steps i.e. every hour), using BLUE. In order to stress the system, we generated the sensors data set ourselves (note this does not affect the generality of our model). When doing so, we assume that the forecast temperature values are more accurate than the sensors observed values; this is described by σ b 2 = 0 . 0005 , σ o 2 = 0 . 5 [13]. As described in Section 3, this will lead to the assimilated values being closer to the forecast values, which we see as logical since we are simulating unexpected scenarios and sporadic events. Reward function: The reward functions in Eqs. (2.2) and (3.3) are set up to minimise the energy consumption of the building while also maintaining a comfortable indoor temperature for any occupants [28]. That means W = 0 . 5 and the constants λ T = 1 and λ E = 1 e − 4 for ensuring correct unit scale [10], and (upper, lower) temperature bounds ( T u p , T l o w ). 5 Experiments We now test our trained agents on a simulation run of one year, recording some of the available metrics returned at each time step. We used the same \u201cHot Dry\u201d environment for the testing as we used in the learning phase. In our setting, the definition of a comfortable indoor temperature also varies throughout the year: in winter, it is between 20 °C and 23.5 °C, while in summer, it is between 23 °C and 26 °C. Summer is defined to be from June 1st to September 30th, while winter is taken to be the rest of the year (in essence absorbing spring and autumn) [42]. Without losing generality, we will be performing DA for each time step from 12:00\u201313:00 on the 15th of every month. Our goal here is to see whether the building HVAC system reacts appropriately to the sudden change in indoor temperature. Taking an original run of indoor temperature datasets (i.e., random actions in the hot environment), at the chosen points we add either 10 ° C or −10 ° C randomly to have one of either a very high temperature (for example, to simulate a temporarily broken AC unit with continued indoor heating), or a very low temperature (for example, the AC unit malfunctions and goes into overdrive for a short period of time). Note that the addition or subtraction is consistent for each of the 4 time steps from 12:00\u201313:00; in other words, if 10 ° C is added at 12:00, it is also added at the other 3 time steps. This gives us a dataset of extreme temperatures (typically either greater than 30 ° C or less than 15 ° C), which we now use to perform DA at the chosen times each month of the year. Note that these temperatures will be referred to as the observed sensors values, data that is provided by the building sensors. 5.1 Training the agents As said before, we train two agents (with and without DA) respectively following Figs. 3 and 5, and we compare the results in terms of both performance (predictions and actions) and efficiency in terms of training time. 5.1.1 Agent no-DA Fig. 8 shows the recording of the available metrics returned at each time step in the simulation run of Agent no-DA. We notice a correlation in some of the metric recordings and some seasonality; for example, in summer, the indoor temperature breaks the comfort range of 23\u201326 °C quite often, which is reflected in both the reward and comfort penalty plots. We then see that the indoor temperature stays more within the comfort range in winter, and some extreme spikes in temperature are reflected in the large reward penalty. The plots also show that the agent preferred two distinct actions, with the others rarely used. We further split the agent actions into winter, spring, summer and autumn seasons, with the idea that the setpoints would vary for each season due to different temperature patterns (Fig. 9). However, we see that the agent has indeed learned to repeat the same two actions almost entirely for the whole year. This seems to suggest a degree of overfitting, with action 8 ( h e a t i n g _ s e t p o i n t = c o o l i n g _ s e t p o i n t = 22 ) dominating nighttime hours throughout the year, and action 4 ( h e a t i n g _ s e t p o i n t = 19 ; c o o l i n g _ s e t p o i n t = 26 ) doing the same for daytime hours (Fig. 10). With an outdoor temperature that is clearly seasonal, we would expect more variety of actions from our agent between seasons, but this has been ignored in favour of a more promising reward. 5.1.2 Agent with-DA Repeating the simulation year for Agent with-DA, we again obtain several plotting metrics (shown in Fig. 11). We see that, as predicted, the indoor temperature is very similar to earlier (i.e. as with Agent no-DA) due to how we applied BLUE with the given variances ( σ b 2 = 0 . 0005 , σ o 2 = 0 . 5 , i.e. inaccurate sensors temperature values). Most of the other metrics appear to be similar i.e. a consistently larger comfort penalty in summer and the same power pattern as before. What seems to have changed most is the distribution of actions throughout the year; while two actions again seem to dominate, this is less than before, and one of those actions is also a different one. We again split the agent actions into seasons for a more detailed analysis (Fig. 12). As before, we see two actions dominating most of the year (although one of those actions is different from before), particularly in summer. However, in winter and autumn, and to a lesser extent in spring, a sizeable portion of the action space is spread out over four other actions. We can perhaps deduce from this that DA has aided with the overfitting we saw in the regular DQN run earlier, with our agent now more open to choose other actions. 5.1.3 Example runs comparison We look at three metrics from the simulation runs to compare the agents, as shown in Table 1. This difference in performance was almost identical in repeated runs; Agent with-DA would have an improved mean reward, a lower total comfort penalty and breaking the comfort range less often. It is in the final metric where we see real differences in the agents; Agent with-DA manages to stay within the comfort range a great deal more. 5.1.4 Training efficiency As a measure of efficiency, we look at the time taken to train each agent in Table 2. While the time taken to train the agents varies each run, we see that training times are similar for both agents when repeated several times. As in our case, we mostly saw that Agent no-DA was quicker to train. The fact that Agent with-DA is only slower than Agent no-DA to train by a small margin is important; our goal of improved performance should not come at a significant increase in the cost of resources. We are pleased to see that this is not the case. 5.2 Real-time adjustments Section 3.2 described how we set up the real-time adjustments via DA; we now perform this experiment, looking at how our agents deal with injections of extreme temperature in a testing year. We first present, in Fig. 13(a), plots of the indoor temperature and the points where DA occurs; starting with Agent no-DA, also marking the temperature comfort ranges for the defined summer and winter periods (as used for the reward). Naturally, the points where we have performed DA are far outside the comfort ranges; however, we are interested in how well the agent has reacted to the extreme changes in temperature at specific points. To this end, we can look at the comfort penalty in Fig. 13(b) to see if we can learn about the agent performance. We do the same for Agent with-DA in Fig. 14(a). The indoor temperature plots for each run immediately suggest that the DA-trained agent has been more successful in maintaining the temperature comfort range (although this is far more pronounced in winter than in summer). For example, in Fig. 13(a), the temperature for winter seems to consistently go above or below the comfort range. In contrast, in Fig. 14(a) we see that although the range is broken numerous times, it also returns to within the range very often. The DA-trained agent does not look like having an improvement compared to the regular DA during summer; both consistently fall below the comfort range. However, this can be attributed to temperature differences between day and night (recall that the range is identical for every hour of the day). In fact, we see a well-maintained indoor temperature for the office working days. Taking June 5th as an example, with the DA-trained agent, we see that the indoor temperature is relatively well maintained during the 9\u20135 working day (excluding the first couple hours of the day). In contrast, the comfort setting is broken throughout the early hours of the morning and in the evening. This is a trend repeated throughout the summer period, an example of which we see in Fig. 15. The more robust performance of Agent with-DA in winter is also noticeable in the comfort penalty plots. Although there is a more significant number of extreme spikes in comfort penalty in Fig. 14(b) than in Fig. 13(b), there seem to be a greater number of time steps with a small or zero comfort penalty. In other words, the indoor temperature returns to the comfort range more often and/or easily. Again, this is less so in summer, but overall we see that the DA-trained agent (Agent with-DA) has been able to return the indoor temperature to a stable level than a regular agent (Agent no-DA). We can be confident that having DA during the training phase of an agent does help with dealing with extreme real-time changes in temperature. 5.2.1 Real-time adjustment efficiency Table 2 in Section 5.1.4 gave us an insight into the efficiency of DA inside the system; we now look to assess how costly DA is when implemented outside the system. By this, we mean comparing how long a simulation of one year takes when run regularly (i.e. without DA), and as in the real-life scenario (i.e. with DA of extreme values in real-time). We assess Agent with-DA\u2019s run-time in each scenario, as shown in Table 3. From this, we can again conclude that introducing DA has not significantly increased the computational cost; assimilating extreme temperature recordings is perfectly feasible. 5.2.2 Real-time adjustment runs comparison We now look in Table 4 at the results of a one-year test run for both agents in this scenario where there are injections of extreme temperatures. This is similar to our example runs, with Agent with-DA managing to maintain the temperature within the comfort range more often. We also note in Table 5 that the better results of Agent with-DA are mainly thanks to its performance in the winter period. In fact, Agent with-DA seems to perform slightly worse in summer than Agent no-DA, although repeating the runs we see they have an equal summer performance on average. However, overall we see that Agent with-DA\u2019s performance, both in scenarios with and without extreme temperature injection, is consistently better than Agent no-DA\u2019s. The addition of data assimilation to the agent training seems to have improved performance, and we have seen that this has been achieved without significantly affecting the computational costs. 6 Conclusion In this paper, we have proposed CntrlDA, a building energy management control system with real-time adjustments improving the RL formulation by coupling it with DA. Our battery of experiments, in a building simulation environment, shows that training an RL control agent with data assimilation and external data leads to better performance than training the agent using only the simulation data. The new agent can consistently better manage the indoor temperature of our given building (with a 15.6% reduction in the number of comfort penalty breaches). We also see that our improvements to this agent are not computationally costly to implement (in fact, it uses almost exactly the same resources as the original agent). Including the DA stage, the agent better learns how to deal with unexpected events, common in real-life systems and particularly in building energy control scenarios. We see that the improved performance is extended to the case where there are extreme temperature occurrences due to outside factors (this time seeing a 15.4% reduction in the number of comfort penalty breaches). This property may be advantageous and might be worth exploring further; this would be relevant to systems where extreme events regularly occur, and an agent being able to recover from these events and run the system smoothly is imperative. This could also mean expanding the ideas to control problems outside of energy control. Our results have the potential for improvement. For example, we see that the higher agent performance is mainly limited to the winter months; knowing the exact reason for that (particular weather, the inertia of the building, control actions, etc.), would allow us to tackle the agent for the summer period better. The Sinergym library also has additional flexibility, which we have not explored fully. For example, as seen in Fig. 15, the comfort penalty for the summer months was mainly due to the nighttime temperature being outside the comfort range. This is an unnecessary penalty as we are interested in the daytime control, when the building is in use (we remember that it is a commercial building). Perhaps this penalty could be removed for outside working hours or simply changed to another range. Additionally, the comfort penalty was also defined only for two periods (winter and summer); it remains unexplored whether or not having a higher granularity (i.e. more separate periods) would produce a better agent.

        "dc:description": "Rule-Based Control (RBC) and Model Predictive Control (MPC) have been traditionally used to control building heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. They, however, present shortcomings when faced with efficiently controlling these systems at a larger level. Reinforcement Learning (RL) has recently emerged as a viable alternative, showing promising results compared to previous methods, but still having some difficulties with untrained situations or sudden changes. CntrlDA is our proposal on improving the RL formulation by coupling it with data assimilation (DA), a technique commonly used in numerical weather prediction. Our battery of experiments, in a building simulation environment, shows that training a RL control agent with DA and external data, leads to better performance than training the agent using only the simulation data. The RL control agent with DA maintains the temperature range 15.6% more often than the RL control agent without DA. It is also shown that by including a DA stage in the control process, the agent better deals with unexpected events (which are common in real-life systems and particularly in building energy control scenarios). We show that it maintains the range 15.4% more often than the system without DA with no significant added cost of resources.",
