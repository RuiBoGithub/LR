Personalizing the operation of HVAC systems depending on thermal zone could reduce energy consumption while minimizing the thermal discomfort of occupants in multi-zone buildings. Integrating smart metering technologies with building energy management systems in multi-zone buildings makes it possible to categorize individual rooms into several meaningful end-user groups (i.e., thermal zones) based on energy use behaviors. Unfortunately, it still remains unclear how energy efficient end-user groups are in multi-zone buildings. Therefore, this study evaluates the energy efficiency of end-user groups in multi-zone buildings. An energy efficiency assessment framework for end-user groups is developed using energy benchmarking data from seven dormitory buildings in Seoul, Korea. The results show that during the heating season, consistent energy users have the lowest energy efficiency among all end-user groups, especially during unoccupied hours. Also, the energy efficiency of nighttime-peak energy users is low when the outdoor dry-bulb temperature is higher than 0 °C. Last, the occupied buildings have a higher potential for energy savings at over 0 °C. The proposed framework could allow facility managers to determine appropriate control strategies for HVAC systems and personalize the control parameters depending on end-user group. Keywords Energy efficiency Control strategies HVAC Systems Multi-zone buildings Data mining techniques 1 Introduction The building sector has received increasing attention for energy savings since it is responsible for a large portion of energy demand (e.g., 38.5% in the United States [1] and 40% in the European Union [2]). Accordingly, much effort has been made to reduce energy consumption in buildings by improving thermal insulation performance [3,4] or installing energy-efficient mechanical and electrical (M&E) systems [5,6]. In addition, recent studies have focused on control strategies for M&E equipment during building operation [7\u20139]. This shift from technical solutions to operation-focused solutions has been driven by its significant potential for energy savings with less effort [9]. An empirical investigation [10] found that occupied commercial buildings use excessive energy due to the unnecessary usage of artificial lighting in the daytime. Several studies [11,12] also discovered that leaving HVAC systems on during unoccupied hours represents up to 50% of the total energy usage of buildings. This indicates that the energy-efficient operation of M&E equipment could contribute to significant energy savings with less investment. It is important to operate HVAC systems efficiently because they consume almost half the energy used in buildings [7,8]. For example, HVAC systems are the largest energy-consuming items in the United States, accounting for 53% of residential energy consumption [13] and 48% of commercial energy consumption [14]. Energy-efficient operation of HAVC systems has proven to be the most promising way to reduce energy consumption in buildings. Yang et al. [15] found that building energy consumption can be reduced by up to 33.6% by adjusting the temperature setpoint of HVAC systems. A wide variety of HVAC control strategies have been proposed to reduce energy consumption in buildings [16\u201318]. The most common control parameters in HVAC simulation and control are the temperature setpoint [16] and operation time (i.e., on/off time) [17]. Researchers hypothesize that personalizing the operation of HVAC systems depending on thermal zone reduces energy consumption while minimizing the thermal discomfort of occupants in indoor environments [19]. Personalized HVAC control is greatly needed for multi-zone buildings in particular, where the temperature setpoint and on/off time can be individually controlled in every zone. This is important because there are different energy use patterns depending on each thermal zone. However, all thermal zones are typically conditioned using the same operational settings (i.e., temperature setpoint, on/off time), which could result in thermal discomfort during occupied hours or wasted energy during unoccupied hours. Some HVAC control strategies provide occupants with personalized thermal environments based on floor level [20,21] and adjacency among rooms [21,22] (i.e., thermal zoning). However, there are still limitations in providing thermal comfort across all zones because rooms within each zone can have different energy use patterns. Personalizing the operation of HVAC systems at the room level could be ideal for multi-zone buildings but is practically infeasible because it requires the control parameters to be set up across all thermal zones. As sensing technology becomes integrated with building energy management systems (BEMS), energy use profiles of occupants are readily available at a high spatial resolution (e.g., at the room level) and temporal resolution (e.g., at 1-h intervals). Since energy use profiles are considered as a proxy of how occupants behave in buildings, rooms can be categorized into several end-user groups (EUGs) (i.e., thermal zones) based on similar energy use patterns [23\u201327]. Consequently, the integration of sensing technology into BEMS in multi-zone buildings makes it possible to reduce energy consumption while improving the thermal comfort of occupants. Unfortunately, despite the potential benefit of EUG categorization for personalized HVAC control in multi-zone buildings, there is little investigation of how energy-efficient EUGs are in multi-zone buildings. Investigating the energy efficiency of EUGs in multi-zone buildings is important because it could provide insight into which groups have potential for energy savings. Most importantly, once low energy-efficient EUGs are identified in multi-zone buildings, it is possible to determine appropriate control strategies for HVAC systems and then personalize the control parameters depending on EUG. For example, when a certain EUG has a low energy efficiency during unoccupied hours, interrupting the operation of HVAC systems could avoid wasting energy in multi-zone buildings. Also, if EUGs have different occupancy patterns, using different interruption time periods depending on EUG will help to improve the thermal comfort of occupants in the buildings. Until recently, many studies have identified representative EUGs using highly granular energy use profiles from residential [28\u201334] or non-residential buildings [35\u201337]. EUG categorization has been used for modeling energy tariff structures [35], occupant behavior intervention [29], E&M control [38], and renewable electricity generation [32]. However, the energy efficiency of EUGs has not been investigated during the process of group categorization. Some studies have evaluated how EUGs consume energy during an average day in certain periods (e.g., summer months) [28\u201330,33,34]. However, there are still limitations because the studies did not compare the energy consumption of EUGs under the same condition (e.g., building characteristics). Thus, it is difficult to determine which EUGs have lower energy efficiency than others. Therefore, to fill the gap in literature, the objective of this study is to evaluate the energy efficiency of EUGs in multi-zone buildings. To achieve this objective, an energy efficiency assessment framework is proposed to identify representative EUGs and evaluate their energy consumption. The proposed assessment framework could enable facility managers to personalize the operation of HVAC systems based on EUGs in multi-zone buildings. This paper is organized as follows. First, an energy efficiency assessment framework is developed using sensor data (i.e., energy use and occupancy status) and building characteristics data. This is followed by an overview of the data collection. Next, the clustering and energy efficiency assessment results are presented. This is followed by a discussion of the results and conclusions. 2 Energy efficiency assessment framework for EUGs This research proposes an energy efficiency assessment framework to identify representative end-user groups in multi-zone buildings and evaluate their energy consumption. To improve the usability of the proposed assessment framework, we consider building and occupancy-related characteristics of EUGs during the assessment process. The proposed assessment framework consists of the following three steps (Fig. 1 ). First, energy use data is preprocessed to improve the quality of the analysis. Second, a clustering analysis is conducted to categorize rooms into several EUGs based on occupants\u2019 energy use patterns. Third, the energy efficiency of EUGs is evaluated with a consideration of building and occupancy-related characteristics. 2.1 Data preprocessing To improve the quality of analysis, data for energy consumption is preprocessed in the following two aspects. First, daily energy use profiles for individual rooms are created and normalized because the variables with larger values dominate other variables when calculating the similarity between objects [39]. To this end, we transform the original value of energy consumption within a range of zero to one using min-max normalization. This normalization method has been successfully used to categorize daily energy use profiles into several meaningful EUGs [35,38]. The normalized energy consumption (e norm ) is calculated as follows: (1) e n o r m ∗ j ( i ) = e j ( i ) − e m i n ∗ j e m a x ∗ j − e m i n ∗ j where, e j (i) is the original amount of energy consumed at time i, e min∗j is the minimum amount of energy consumption for room j, and e max∗j is the maximum amount of energy consumption for room j. Second, the dimension of the normalized energy use dataset is reduced to lower-dimensional spaces. In general, analyzing high-dimensional data has an adverse effect on clustering performance due to the sparsity of the available data [34,40]. Therefore, most studies on EUG categorization have addressed the high dimensionality of energy use data during the categorization process by using principal component analysis (PCA) [32,35,41], Fourier transformation [42,43], and wavelet transformation [44,45]. In this study, PCA is used as a data reduction method because it has been proven to be more effective in this context [35]. PCA converts energy use data into a set of feature vectors (i.e., principal components) [46]. The dimension of the extracted features is less than or equal to the number of original variables (i.e., the time of day). 2.2 EUG categorization After the data preprocessing, a clustering analysis is performed to categorize rooms into several EUGs based on similarities in daily energy use profiles. The similarity is calculated using distance measures (e.g., Euclidean, Manhattan, Minkowski, or Supremum distance). Among these distance measures, this research adopts Euclidean distance due to its wide applicability in EUG categorization [30,38]. For objects p = (p 1 , p 2 , p 3 \u2026 p n ) and q = (q 1 , q 2 , q 3 \u2026 q n ), the Euclidean distance is defined as: (2) d i s t ( p , q ) = ∑ i = 1 n ( p i − q i ) 2 Based on the distance values, a set of objects are separated into groups using clustering algorithms (e.g., k-means or hierarchical clustering). In this study, the hierarchical clustering algorithm is used as a clustering algorithm due to its better performance than k-means algorithms [35]. Also, since the clustering performance of the k-means algorithm varies depending on the initial cluster centroid position for each iteration, it is difficult to obtain reliable clustering results [39]. The hierarchical clustering algorithm considers each data object as one cluster and then merges the two closest clusters into one new cluster based on their similarity (i.e., distance). This process is repeated until all clusters are merged into a single cluster. The clustering results are evaluated to determine the best number of clusters in the given datasets (i.e., representative EUGs during the given monitoring period). The Davies-Bouldin Index (DBI) is used as a clustering evaluation criterion, which is the mean value of a ratio of inter-cluster and intra-cluster distances [47]. The DBI is more effective in finding the best number of clusters in monotonic, noisy, dense, and skewed datasets than other clustering evaluation criterion (e.g., Silhouette Index, Clustering Dispersion Indicator) [48]. The DBI has also been widely accepted in the field of EUG identification [35]. The DBI value can be calculated as follows: (3) D B I = 1 k ∑ i = 1 k m a x j ≠ i { d i ¯ + d j ¯ d i j } where k is the number of clusters; d i ¯ is the average distance between all objects in the i th cluster and the centroid of the i th cluster; d j ¯ is the average distance between all objects in the j th cluster; and d ij is the distance between the centroids of the i th and j th clusters. The minimum DBI corresponds to good clusters or is regarded as an optimal clustering solution. 2.3 Energy efficiency assessment A benchmark-based assessment method is used to investigate the energy efficiency of EUGs in multi-zone buildings. This method compares building energy consumption with energy benchmarks that refer to typical energy consumption obtained from building energy simulations [49] or statistical analyses of similar buildings [50,51]. Advanced smart metering technologies have extended the application of benchmarking methods to the energy efficiency assessment of rooms and M&E systems (e.g., HVAC system) [20,52]. Using the benchmark-based assessment method, the energy efficiency of EUGs is evaluated in the following two steps. First, we compare energy consumption of EUGs with an energy benchmark. The energy benchmark is the median energy consumption from a statistical analysis across all rooms. This statistical energy benchmark is more appropriate for this study than a simulated energy benchmark. As buildings undergo a degradation in M&E systems, changes in use (e.g., occupancy schedule) and unexpected fault over time, the simulation results could not be practical for real applications because there are changes in most input parameters [53]. In the course of calculating the statistical energy benchmark, physical and occupancy characteristics of rooms are considered to set the same condition of its comparison with energy use of EUGs. As a physical characteristic variable, room size refers to the floor area (m2) of a room. Since floor area is the most significant factor affecting building energy consumption, it is possible to create an appropriate energy benchmark for each room size [54]. Although considering more physical characteristics (e.g., floor and number of windows) can yield more specific energy benchmarks to each room, it may undermine the validity of the benchmark due to insufficient rooms for the statistical analysis. For the occupancy characteristic variable, occupancy status corresponds to whether a room is occupied or vacant at a certain time. This is important because EUGs could exhibit different energy efficiency depending on occupancy status. Second, we calculate excessive energy consumption as the amount of energy consumed beyond the statistical energy benchmark across all EUGs. This excessive energy consumption represents the potential energy savings through control strategies rather than the amount of energy wasted by each EUG. In this study, the excessive energy consumption EX i for EUG i can be calculated using the following equation: (4) E X i = ∑ j = 1 n E X i ⋅ o c c ( j ) + ∑ j = 1 n E X i ⋅ u n o c c ( j ) (5) E X i ⋅ o c c j = e i · o c c j - b o c c i f e i · o c c j > b o c c ; 0 o t h e r w h i s e (6) E X i ⋅ u n o c c j = e i · u n o c c j - b u n o c c i f e i · u n o c c j > b u n o c c ; 0 o t h e r w i s e where, EX i∙occ (j) is the excessive energy consumption for occupied room j within EUG i, EX i∙unocc (j) is the excessive energy consumption for unoccupied room j within EUG i, e i∙occ (j) is the amount of energy used by occupied room j within EUG i, e i∙unocc (j) is the amount of energy used by unoccupied room j within EUG i, b occ is the energy benchmark for occupied rooms, b unocc is the energy benchmark for unoccupied rooms, and n is the number of rooms within EUG i. Positive EX values indicate highly energy-efficient EUGs. 3 Data collection Data was collected from seven dormitory buildings at a university in Seoul, South Korea. The buildings are close to each other and share the same construction year and physical characteristics. College students live in these on-campus buildings, consisting of 250 single-occupancy rooms and 1125 double-occupancy rooms. All of the rooms are equipped with two types of real-time measuring systems. First, energy metering systems measure the amount of energy consumed in each room. The energy use data includes electrical loads from under-floor electric heating systems, ceiling-mounted air-conditioners, mini-refrigerators, lights, and personal devices. The HVAC systems are identical across all the rooms and can be individually controlled by occupants with different operating settings (i.e., turning on/off and adjusting the temperature setpoint). Second, card entry systems provide a record of the changes in occupancy status of each room. Using these measuring systems, the historical data on energy use and occupancy was obtained with 1-h time intervals and during the heating season (November 1, 2014, to February 28, 2015). Table 1 presents an overview of the buildings. Once the data was collected, we excluded 448 rooms from analysis due to abnormal values for either energy use or occupancy status as a result of system malfunction. Also, the historical data collected on November 28 and 29, 2014, was not used due to missing values for energy use. Thus, the final dataset consists of 927 rooms (171 single-occupancy rooms and 756 double-occupancy rooms) for 118 days. 4 Results and discussion The energy efficiency of EUGs in the case buildings is investigated using the proposed assessment framework as follows. First, the dimension of energy use data is reduced by increasing the explained variance of principal components from 86% to 96% by altering it by 4% per iteration, which significantly affects the clustering performance [40]. Second, a clustering analysis is conducted using hierarchical clustering algorithm in conjunction with Ward linkage. During the clustering process, the number of clusters k varies from 2 to 100. 4.1 EUG categorization 4.1.1 Number of EUGs Using the preprocessed datasets produces lower DBI values across all the number of clusters (i.e., EUGs) than the original dataset (Fig. 2 ). As the explained variance of principal components decreases, the DBI values decrease across all k variables. When evaluating the clustering performance across different number of clusters by dataset type, the lowest DBI value is 1.0675 at ten clusters when the principal components explain 86% of the total variance in the original dataset. Thus, the multi-zone buildings have ten representative EUGs during the heating season. The clustering results suggest that reducing the dimensionality of energy use data using PCA improves the performance of EUG categorization, as shown by Chicco et al. [40]. However, compared to their study, our results show a different tendency of clustering performance. Chicco et al. [40] obtained better clustering performance with a higher explained variance of principal components, while in this study, the clustering performance was improved as the explained variance of principal components decreased. These conflicting results could be caused by the different effects of data preprocessing techniques on the clustering performance depending on the characteristics of energy use data [55]. In the present study, energy use data were collected from dormitory buildings, but Chicco et al. [40] used non-residential energy data. Furthermore, the studies used different temporal resolutions (60 min versus 15 min) and spatial resolutions (room level versus building level). 4.1.2 Daily profiles for EUGs When investigating the average daily profiles of energy use and occupancy for the identified EUGs, there are three distinguishable load shapes: daytime peak, nighttime peak and consistent energy use (Fig. 3 ). The daytime-peak energy users (EUG1) generally consume a significant amount of electrical energy from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. This load shape may not be typical in residential buildings due to high energy consumption at noon. However, in light of students\u2019 weekly schedules, this could be understandable because on the weekend, some dormitory rooms are occupied in the daytime but vacant at night for students\u2019 personal activities (e.g., visiting friends or family. For the nighttime-peak energy users (EUG2, EUG3, EUG4, and EUG5), most daily electricity is used from the evening to the next morning (9 p.m.\u20139 a.m.). This can be expected because students generally leave their rooms in the daytime to attend classes or go to laboratories. The consistent energy users (EUG6, EUG7, EUG8, EUG9, and EUG10) tend to consume a constant amount of electrical energy regardless of occupancy status. Although they leave their rooms in the daytime, the electricity use during unoccupied hours is similar to that during occupied hours. These results can be explained by the users turning on energy-consuming items after leaving their rooms (e.g., desktop computers or HVAC systems). 4.1.3 Energy consumption by EUG Fig. 4 -a shows the average hourly energy use by EUG. During the heating season, it seems that EUG9 and EUG10 consume the largest amounts of electricity during both occupied hours (1.01 kWh and 1.4 kWh) and unoccupied hours (0.93 kWh and 1.29 kWh). EUG3 and EUG4 also use high amounts of energy when they are in their rooms (0.98 kWh and 0.96 kWh). Interestingly, EUG6 rarely consumes electricity all day (occupied hours: 0.10 kWh, unoccupied hours: 0.08 kWh). Across all the EUGs, the energy consumption during occupied and unoccupied hours is weakly correlated with outdoor dry-bulb temperature (Fig. 5 ). This is understandable because regardless of weather conditions, occupants are allocated into one of the identified EUGs based on not only the time of energy consumption but also the amount of energy consumed at the time. These results indicate that occupants in each EUG consume similar amounts of energy regardless of changes in outdoor dry-bulb temperature. 4.1.4 of EUGs Fig. 4-b shows the percentage of EUGs in the case buildings. Throughout the heating season, EUG8 is the most prevalent at approximately 24% of total rooms. When investigating the percentage of EUGs by outdoor dry-bulb temperature, the low energy consumers (EUG2 and EUG6) have positive correlation coefficients of 0.607 and 0.701, respectively (Fig. 6 ). This indicates that EUG2 and EUG 6 are less prevalent as the outdoor dry-bulb temperature decreases. In contrast, the high energy consumers (EUG3, EUG9, and EUG10) accounts for a larger percentage of total rooms as the outdoor dry-bulb temperature decreases (Pearson\u2019s r = −0.538 for EUG3, -0.775 for EUG8, -0.807 for EUG9, -0.774 for EUG10). These conflicting results between low and high energy consumers can be expected from the fact that occupants consume more energy under severe weather conditions [56]. 4.2 Energy efficiency of EUGs 4.2.1 Energy benchmark Regardless of whether anyone is home or not, the average energy benchmarks are statistically higher in double-occupancy rooms than single-occupancy rooms (occupied hours: 0.81 kWh versus 0.63 kWh, unoccupied hours: 0.60 kWh versus 0.48 kWh) (Fig. 7 -a). Occupied rooms also have significantly higher energy benchmarks on average than unoccupied rooms, regardless of room size (single rooms: 0.63 kWh versus 0.48 kWh, double rooms: 0.81 kWh versus 0.60 kWh) (Fig. 7-b). These results can be expected because occupants generally consume more energy in larger rooms and when they are actually in their rooms [56,57]. Across different occupancy statuses, there is a negative correlation between outdoor dry-bulb temperature and the energy benchmarks (occupied hours: Pearson\u2019s r = -0.8206, p < 0.001; unoccupied hours: Pearson\u2019s r = -0.8569, p < 0.001) (Fig. 8 ). These results indicate that the case buildings have lower energy benchmarks as the outdoor dry-bulb temperature increases. This is caused by the high energy users (e.g., EUG3 and EUG9) having less prevalence under warmer weather conditions, despite occupants in each EUG consuming similar amounts of energy regardless of dry-bulb temperature. 4.2.2 Excessive energy consumption On average, 16.9% of all daily electricity use is excessively consumed in the case buildings (Fig. 9 ). The total excessive energy consumption increases in warmer weather conditions. Some extreme cases of total excessive energy consumption (more than 30%) are found at over 10 °C. Looking closely at these quantities by EUG, most of the total excessive energy consumption is produced by EUG8 in relatively warm weather conditions (higher than 0 °C) and by EUG9 under relatively cold weather conditions (lower than 0 °C). Nighttime-peak energy users (EUG3 and EUG 4) are also responsible for the total excessive energy consumption when the outdoor dry-bulb temperature is over 0 °C. In contrast, the daytime-peak rarely account for total excessive energy consumption. When investigating the excessive energy consumption across different occupancy statuses by EUG, the daytime-peak (EUG1) and consistent energy users (EUG7, EUG8, and EUG9) produce more than 50% of their excessive energy consumption during unoccupied hours (Fig. 4-c). In the case of the nighttime-peak energy users (EUG2, EUG3, EUG4, and EUG5), more than 90% of their excessive energy consumption is during occupied hours. Additionally, there is no significant difference in the total excessive energy consumption by occupancy status (occupied hours: 8.51%, unoccupied hours: 8.38%) (Fig. 10 -a). However, when the outdoor dry-bulb temperature is higher than 0 °C, the total amount of energy exceeding energy benchmarks is higher in occupied buildings than unoccupied buildings (see Fig. 10-b). This could be caused by EUG3 and EUG4\u2019s excessive energy consumption during only occupied hours. The findings show that the consistent energy users (EUG8 and EUG9) have the lowest energy efficiency among all of the EUGs in these case buildings. In other words, they have significant potential for energy savings from HVAC control during all heating periods. These groups mostly produce excessive energy consumption during unoccupied hours. Therefore, interrupting the operation of HVAC systems when buildings are unoccupied [58] could maximize energy savings in these case buildings. In particular, considering that the identified EUGs have different occupancy patterns, using different start and end times of HVAC systems depending on EUG could help improve occupants\u2019 thermal comfort when they are in rooms. Furthermore, it seems that the energy efficiency of the nighttime-peak energy users (EUG3 and EUG4) is low when the outdoor dry-bulb temperature is over 0 °C. As a consequence, the total excessive energy consumption is larger during occupied hours than unoccupied hours. These results indicate that when the outdoor dry-bulb temperature is over 0 °C, decreasing the temperature setpoint of HVAC systems during occupied hours [59] could make the case buildings more energy efficient. Further, considering that EUGs are in their rooms during different time periods of the day (e.g., daytime for EUG1 and nighttime for EUG3), different variations in the temperature setpoint depending on EUG would be useful to maximize the effectiveness of personalized HVAC system control because a thermally comfortable environment can be achieved at a lower temperature setpoint more easily in the daytime than at night. 5 Conclusions Integrating smart sensing technologies with BEMS in multi-zone buildings allows facility managers to categorize rooms into several meaningful end-user groups (i.e., thermal zones) based on similar energy use patterns. Further, understanding how efficiently EUGs consume energy in multi-zone buildings would help personalize the control parameters of HVAC systems depending on the groups. As a consequence, it is possible to reduce energy consumption in multi-zone buildings while providing occupants with a thermally comfortable environment. This research evaluated the energy efficiency of end-user groups in multi-zone buildings. The three key findings are as follow. First, consistent energy users had the lowest energy efficiency among all end-user groups in the multi-zone buildings. Particularly, their energy efficiency was lower during unoccupied hours than occupied hours. Second, the energy efficiency of nighttime-peak energy users is low when the outdoor dry-bulb temperature is higher than 0 °C. Third, the occupied buildings have higher potential for energy savings than the unoccupied buildings at over 0 °C. This research contributes to the literature by presenting a first look into the energy efficiency of end-user groups in multi-zone buildings. In addition, this research develops an energy efficiency assessment framework that not only identifies representative end-user groups in multi-zone buildings but also estimate potential energy savings for each group. With the proposed assessment framework, facility managers could determine appropriate control strategies for HVAC systems and personalize the control parameters depending on the EUG. On the other hand, an issue might arise about the usability of the proposed assessment framework because high granular data for energy consumption and occupancy should be collected across all rooms in multi-zone buildings. However, numerous smart metering technologies have been deployed more widely for building energy use prediction [60,61], indoor environment control [62] and building system control [63,64] at a higher spatial and temporal level. Future studies should consider the function of rooms during the energy benchmark calculation process to extend the applicability of the proposed assessment framework to other multi-zone buildings. This is important because similar-sized rooms can have different energy use depending on its function. For example, Song et al. [65] discovered that in a university building, there are differences in energy consumption between similar-sized classrooms due to different lecture requirements (e.g., darkroom bulbs, potter\u2019s wheels).

        "dc:description": "HVAC control strategies have been considered as a means to reduce energy consumption in buildings. Personalizing the operation of HVAC systems depending on thermal zone could reduce energy consumption while minimizing the thermal discomfort of occupants in multi-zone buildings. Integrating smart metering technologies with building energy management systems in multi-zone buildings makes it possible to categorize individual rooms into several meaningful end-user groups (i.e., thermal zones) based on energy use behaviors. Unfortunately, it still remains unclear how energy efficient end-user groups are in multi-zone buildings. Therefore, this study evaluates the energy efficiency of end-user groups in multi-zone buildings. An energy efficiency assessment framework for end-user groups is developed using energy benchmarking data from seven dormitory buildings in Seoul, Korea. The results show that during the heating season, consistent energy users have the lowest energy efficiency among all end-user groups, especially during unoccupied hours. Also, the energy efficiency of nighttime-peak energy users is low when the outdoor dry-bulb temperature is higher than 0 °C. Last, the occupied buildings have a higher potential for energy savings at over 0 °C. The proposed framework could allow facility managers to determine appropriate control strategies for HVAC systems and personalize the control parameters depending on end-user group.",
