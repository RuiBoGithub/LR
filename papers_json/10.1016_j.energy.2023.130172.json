Handling editor: Henrik Lund Optimal characteristic parameters and control strategies in the operation of urban heating systems are significant for carbon reduction and high efficiency. Considering load fluctuations and real-time outdoor temperature changes, this research constructs steady-state and dynamic heat current models of the heating system based on the standard thermal resistance model. Combined with genetic algorithms, an optimal setting method is proposed for the operating characteristic parameters of the heating system under variable operating conditions. To achieve the control of the optimal characteristic parameters, the dynamic heat current model is applied to derive the system energy state space equations and obtain the state space parameter matrix. Moreover, a holistic control strategy for the heating system based on the optimal node parameters is proposed. The control simulation results show that the proposed holistic control strategy based on the optimal node temperature can save energy by 25.4 % compared with the fixed node temperature. Meanwhile, the exergy efficiency of the heating system increases by 2.3 %. That is, the proposed asynchronous time-scale holistic control method is significant for the day-ahead optimal regulation strategy of the district heating system.

Buildings account for 40 % of global energy consumption and emit 30 % of greenhouse gases [2]. Among them, winter heating energy consumption in northern China accounts for about 20 % of the total building energy consumption, which has considerable potential for building energy efficiency. With the gradual establishment and improvement of integrated energy systems in China, heating systems are changing towards high efficiency, cleanliness, and innovative safety [3]. The flexibility of the electricity and heat loads is used to deeply explore the user side's flexibility and meet users' diversified needs, thereby consuming more renewable energy [4\u20136]. Therefore, developing clean heat supply technologies and decarbonizing heat supply systems are essential measures to promote the construction of the \"double carbon\" strategy [7]. Around efficient and low-carbon heating systems, fourth-generation district heating systems (4GDH) are currently proposed in European countries [8]. Nielsen et al. [9] also analyzed the impact of the 4GDH in Aalborg, Denmark, which reduces primary energy consumption and energy system costs. Therein, a district heating system includes heat sources, transmission pipes, heat exchange stations, and building users and involves physical processes such as heat transfer, flow, heat storage, and leakage. The dynamic modeling of the heating system and heating regulation strategies are the basis for developing and realizing intelligent heating systems [10,11]. Existing studies mainly have mechanism-driven and data-driven modeling approaches for the dynamic modeling of heating systems [12]. Regarding mechanism-driven modeling, studies have been conducted to model and optimize the district heating system based on thermodynamic analysis and thermal resistance methods [13\u201317]. Ju et al. [18] established a matrix model of a typical heating system based on standard thermal resistance and obtained the corresponding matrix equations reflecting the system power supply topology. Zheng et al. [19] proposed a functional method based on Fourier series expansion to get the analytical solution of the transient energy conservation equation for pipelines considering the flow time, pipe heat capacity, and heat loss. Homod et al. [20] used the physical laws of thermal inertia, empirical functions, and the thermodynamic criterion function method to establish a hybrid air conditioning model for building structures to achieve control of indoor temperature and humidity in buildings. Meanwhile, there are also studies based on the perspective of data-driven modeling, proposing neural networks and genetic algorithms for modeling and analyzing district heating systems [21\u201323]. For example, Ling et al. [24] used the backpropagation neural network (BPNN) model and a support vector regression (SVR) model to solve variable input selection based on hourly correlation analysis. Pan et al. [25] used a greedy method to propose a feasible domain approach to model the thermal power of a heating system. Harish and Kumar [26] applied the Crank-Nicholson method to solve the partial differential equations for the thermal operating conditions of the building. Kim et al. [27] improved the grey box model by including external disturbances as input to the unmeasured variables. Based on the heating system's transient model, the heating system's adjustment strategies are usually divided into qualitative and quantitative adjustments. Existing research has mainly focused on qualitative regulation, with existing research methods concentrating on numerical simulations and experimental tests. For example, Chen et al. [28] established an experimental platform to combine passive and active heat storage systems in buildings to tap into the energy-saving potential of buildings and improve the flexibility of heat supply. Ge et al. [29] constructed a holistic, dynamic heat flow model of the heating system from the heat source to the user and proposed an iterative approach for developing various heating strategies for hourly mass regulation of the primary heating network. Popescu et al. [30] used Simulink to model a thermal automatic control system and analyze the temperature profiles of the model system, indoor temperature, outdoor temperature, and heating temperature, to improve the thermal comfort of the building through automatic control. Hui et al. [31] used an enhanced multi-objective fireworks algorithm to analyze a multi-heat source heating system to achieve optimal operating conditions. Sun et al. [32] proposed a DHS control strategy that integrated the characteristics of users' energy-saving behavior and used the switching of temperature-controlled valves to achieve combined feedforward and feedback control. Li et al. [33] proposed a collaborative dispatch model for integrated power and district heating systems considering district heating networks and the thermal inertia of aggregated buildings. He et al. [17] derived comprehensive constraint equations reflecting the heat transfer and heat storage laws of the system and proposed an integrated control method that achieves optimal control of the heat transfer system by considering the interaction of multiple control variables and objectives. The above research of heat supply systems mainly focuses on system modeling and control, and provides some significant contribution for the performance improvement of heating system. Some studies have taken more attention on the system simulation based on the commercial software such as TRNSYS, MODELICA, etc. Meanwhile, the optimal control mainly also focusses on the control methods such as proportional integral derivative (PID) controllers, fuzzy PID controllers, and particle swarm optimization. However, because the heat transfer equations for heat exchangers are nonlinear, and the synergy between calculation efficiency and calculation accuracy are always for the heat transfer system modeling. The combination between component performance and the system topology are important for the overall modeling. Meanwhile, these existing control methods are not easy to reveal the interaction among heat exchangers, and ensure optimal control of the whole system. Therefore, there is an urgent need to characterize their interrelationships and propose an integrated model to reflect the overall heat transfer laws of the entire system, which is conducive to dynamic thermal performance analysis and optimal control. Recently, based on the standard thermal resistance [34] and heat current method [35,36], He et al. [16,17] proposed an alternative transient heat current model for modeling and control of the heat transfer process and system. Moreover, He et al. [37] also developed an isomorphic multi-energy flow modeling by considering the nonlinear heat transfer constraint in the integrated power and thermal energy system. On this basis, more related publications [38\u201341] have developed and applied the heating supply system's dynamic model to provide a feasible and potential scheduling strategy for the integrated energy system. These applications and development offer a new perspective for the modeling and control of the heat supply system. This paper proposes an optimized method for setting the operating parameters of the heating system under variable operating conditions, which can provide optimal operating parameters for the system operation. Based on dynamic performance analysis and Kirchhoff's Law, this paper presents the state vector of the heating system, constructs the state space equations of the heating system, derives the corresponding state space parameter matrix, analyses the control logic relationship between the parameters in the heating system, and proposes the holistic optimal control strategy of the district heating system based on node parameter optimization. By applying MATLAB Simulink system control simulation, the system's energy consumption is compared under the guidance of the optimized and fixed node temperatures. The state observer of this closed-loop system is also constructed to observe the dynamic control characteristics of the feedback control system. This provides a reference basis for the optimal control strategy of the district heating system. 2 District heating system Fig. 1 gives a typical district heating system in the city region, which mainly includes three circulation loops: primary network heat exchange station, secondary network heat exchange station, and heat exchange station on the customer side. The system heat load is Q, the heating temperature of the primary network heat exchange station is T h,i, and the heat capacity flow of the hot water into the secondary network heat exchange station is G1 and is exchanged with the cold return water from the secondary network heat exchange station. In the secondary network heat exchange station, the cold side fluid inlet temperature is T c1,i, and the outlet temperature is T c1,o. The heat capacity flow of the hot water to the heat exchange station is G2 and is exchanged with the cold side return water from the heat exchange station. In the customer-side heat exchange station, the cold-side fluid has an inlet temperature of T c2,i and an outlet temperature of T c2,o. The heat capacity flow of the hot water into the room is G3 and is exchanged with the indoor air. The indoor temperature T we is set according to user requirements, and the outdoor air temperature is T e. The main energy-consuming components in the system are the pumps in the three heating circuits. The district heating system shown in Fig. 1 covers the coupled processes of heat transfer, mass transfer, flow, and thermal work conversion. The differences in the driving potentials of the coupled heat and mass transfer processes and the crossover of thermodynamic parameters in the thermal work conversion process make the different processes in the system mutually associated and the many parameters interact with each other. The holistic analysis of the system relies on the construction of an integrated model of the system. 3 Steady-state heat current model for heating systems 3.1 Standard thermal resistance model Each heat exchanger station in a district heating system contains an inter-wall heat exchanger with two fluids exchanging heat, i.e., cooling water and circulating hot water for heat transfer. In comparison, the room can be seen as a heat exchange process between two fluids, a hot water supply and outdoor air. The heat exchanger can be modeled using a standard thermal resistance model [34] defined by the inlet temperature difference. Describing its heat transfer process can be analogous to Ohm's law, i.e., the linear transport equation for the device is expressed through the ratio of the thermal pressure to the thermal resistance as the amount of heat exchanged: (1) Q = T h , in − T c , in R HX where the difference between the inlet temperature of hot fluid and that of cold fluid is the maximum temperature difference of the heat exchanger. R HX is a standardized thermal resistance model that characterizes the heat transfer performance of the heat exchanger, and its calculation formula can be expressed as: (2) R HX = exp ( N T U h ) G h − exp ( N T U c ) G c exp ( N T U h ) − exp ( N T U c ) where NTU h and NTU c represent the number of heat transfer units at the hot end and the number of heat transfer units at the cold end of the heat exchanger, respectively. They can be expressed as the ratio of the heat conductivity of the heat exchanger to the heat capacity flow of the hot and cold fluids. The specific expression is: (3) N T U h = φ K A G h , N T U c = φ K A G c where φ is the correction factor of the heat exchanger. K and A represent each heat exchanger's total heat transfer coefficient and heat transfer area, respectively. G H and G C represent the heat capacity flow of hot and cold fluids, respectively. They are the product of specific heat capacity corresponding to the mass flow of hot and cold fluids and the characteristic temperature. 3.2 Steady-state heat current model Based on the district heating system shown in Figs. 1 and 2 presents the equivalent steady-state heat current model of the multi-loop heat exchange system using the standard thermal resistance. T h,i is the primary network heating temperature. T c1,i and T c2,i are the temperatures in the secondary network and customer-side heating circuits, respectively. The four thermal resistances R 1, R 2, R 3, and R 4 represent the heat transfer from high temperature to low temperature through four heat exchangers, i.e., the heat exchange process in the primary network heat exchange station, the heat exchange process in the secondary network heat exchange station, the heat exchange process in the customer side heat exchange station and the heat exchange process in the room. Each thermal resistance in the integrated model of the district heating system thus constructed reflects the transfer resistance in the heat transport process. Besides, each thermodynamic potential (ε) introduced demonstrates the change in the temperature of the working mass due to heat absorption. When the system load Q fluctuates, the steady-state thermal power flow corresponding to each heat transfer process also changes. Meanwhile, the three heating circuits in the system also generate three pump energy consumptions P i (i = 1,2,3). 4 Dynamic energy state space model for heating systems 4.1 Dynamic heat current model of heating systems In analyzing a heat exchanger's dynamic heat transfer process, He et al. [17] defined the heat transfer thermal resistance between the hot and cold fluid and the heat exchanger wall. The temperature difference is also compared to the potential difference of the circuit. The thermal resistance is similar to the resistance, and the heat capacity of the heat exchanger wall is similar to the capacitance. Fig. 3 presents the dynamic heat current model for the dynamic performance analysis of a single heat exchanger. The dynamic energy control equation for the heat exchanger is (4) C w d T w d t = [ T h , i ( t ) − T w ( t ) ] R h + [ T c , i ( t ) − T w ( t ) ] R c where C w is the heat capacity of the heat exchanger wall, R c and R h are the heat transfer thermal resistance between the cold, hot fluid and the heat exchanger wall, respectively (5) R h = 1 G h ( 1 − e − N T U h ) (6) R c = 1 G c ( 1 − e − N T U c ) Based on the analysis of the dynamic performance of each heat exchanger, Fig. 4 presents a dynamic heat current model of the district heating system. The heat flows from the inlet temperature T hi (primary network supply temperature) through six heat exchange thermal resistances influenced by four equivalent capacitors. Finally, it flows to the cold fluid with an inlet temperature T e (outdoor temperature). The heat transfer resistances are, from left to right, the heat transfer resistance R 1h between the primary network hot water supply and the secondary network heat transfer station wall、the heat transfer resistance R 1c between the secondary network heat transfer station wall and the secondary network return water, the heat transfer resistance R 2h between the secondary network water supply and the customer side heat transfer station wall、the heat transfer resistance R 2c between the customer side heat transfer station wall and the customer side return water、the heat transfer resistance R 3h between the customer side water supply and the indoor air and the heat transfer thermal resistance R 3c between indoor and outdoor air. The equivalent heat capacities are, from left to right, the primary network heat exchange station heat capacity C t, the secondary network heat exchange station heat capacity C w1, the customer-side heat exchange station heat capacity C w2 and the room heat capacity C we. 4.2 Energy state space of the heating system In the control of the heating system, when the system load Q fluctuates, in order to maintain the stability of the inlet temperatures T h,i, T c1,i, T c2,i at each heat exchanger station, it is necessary to regulate the heat capacity flow of each loop to form a comprehensive control model. According to the state-space method of automatic control theory, G 1, G 2, and G 3 constitute the input vectors of this heat supply system u (7) u = [ G 1 , G 2 , G 3 ] T To reflect the system state variation with the least variables, T h,i, T w1, T w2, and T we are chosen as the independent state variables, which form a state vector as (8) x = [ T h , i , T w 1 , T w 2 , T we ] T According to the transient heat current model in Fig. 4, applying Kirchhoff's current law yields the governing equations of T h,i, T w1, T w2, and T we (9) [ d T h , i d t d T w 1 d t d T w 2 d t d T we d t ] = [ Q C t T h , i − 1 C t R 1 , h 1 C t R 1 , h 0 1 C w 1 R 1 , h − 1 C w 1 R 1 , h − 1 C w 1 ( R 1 , c + R 2 , h − 1 G 2 ) 1 C w 1 ( R 1 , c + R 2 , h − 1 G 2 ) 0 0 1 C w 1 ( R 1 , c + R 2 , h − 1 G 2 ) − 1 C w 2 ( R 1 , c + R 2 , h − 1 G 2 ) − 1 C w 2 ( R 2 , c + R e , h − 1 G 3 ) 1 C w 2 ( R 2 , c + R e , h − 1 G 3 ) 0 0 1 C e ( R 2 , c + R e , h − 1 G 3 ) − 1 C e ( R 2 , c + R e , h − 1 G 3 ) − 1 R e , c C e ] [ T h , i T w 1 T w 2 T we ] Eq. (9) establishes the holistic dynamic equations for the district heating system, directly linking the heat load and the temperature, heat capacity, and operating parameters at each node, providing the basis for system control design. Eq. (9) lead to the state equation as (10) d x d t = f ( x , u , t ) = [ 1 C t d T h , i d t 1 C w 1 d T w 1 d t 1 C w 2 d T w 2 d t 1 C e d T we d t ] T Eq. (10) describes the variations of state variables caused by the fluctuations of boundary conditions. To realize the temperature control, T h,i、T c1,i、T c2,i are chosen as the output variables of this multi-loop heat transfer system to form an output vector y (11) y = [ T h , i , T c 1 , i , T c 2 , i ] T According to the dynamic heat current model of a district heating system in Fig. 4, T w1, T c1,i, T w2, T c2,i, and T we have the following relations (12) T w 1 − T c 1 , i R 1 , c = G 2 ( T c 1 , o − T c 1 , i ) (13) G 2 ( T c 1 , o − T c 1 , i ) = T c 1 , o − T w 2 R 2 , h (14) T w 2 − T c 2 , i R 2 , c = G 3 ( T c 2 , o − T c 2 , i ) (15) G 3 ( T c 2 , o − T c 2 , i ) = T c 2 , o − T w e R e , h Combining Eqs. (12)\u2013(15) gives the expression of T c1,i and T c2,i as: (16) T c 1 , i = T w 1 − R 1 , c ( T w 1 − T w 2 ) ( R 1 , c + R 2 , h − 1 G 2 ) (17) T c 2 , i = T w 2 − R 2 , c ( T w 2 − T we ) ( R 2 , c + R e , h − 1 G 3 ) Therefore, the output y of the system is the function of x of the system, u of the input and t of the time (18) y = g ( x , u , t ) = [ T h , i T w 1 − R 1 , c ( T w 1 − T w 2 ) ( R 1 , c + R 2 , h − 1 G 2 ) T w 2 − R 2 , c ( T w 2 − T we ) ( R 2 , c + R e , h − 1 G 3 ) ] T In summary, the heating system is described by an equation of state and an output equation, which can be simplified as (19) { d x d t = f ( x , u , t ) y = g ( x , u , t ) Eq. (19) describes the variations of output variables caused by changes in input and state variables. As district heating systems are typically non-linear, their equations of state are complex to solve and not conducive to practical control. It can usually be approximated to a linear system by linearization with sufficient accuracy. Assume that the above non-linear system is described in the state space of state x 0, and input u 0 as (20) { d x d t | x o = f ( x 0 , u 0 , t ) y 0 = g ( x 0 , u 0 , t ) The state-space equations of the system are obtained by Taylor expansions of f( x , u ,t) and g( x , u ,t) in the domain (x 0,u 0), namely (21) δ ( d x d t ) = A δ x + B δ u (22) δ y = C δ x + D δ u where A , B , C , and D are the parameter matrices of the district heating system, reflecting the relationship between the structural parameters of the system itself (each heat transfer thermal conductor), and the operational parameters (each loop flow rate). A is the state matrix, representing the correlation between the system's four node temperatures (T h,i, T w1, T w2, and T we). B is the input matrix, which represents the influence of the system input parameters on the four node temperatures. C is the output matrix, which means the four node temperatures influence the relationship between the output parameters. D is the transfer matrix, which represents the direct influence of the input parameters on the output parameters. The system studied in this paper is a matrices of 4*4, 4*3, 3*4, and 3*3 dimensions, respectively, as shown in the specific expressions in Appendix A. When the state of the system (x 0, u 0) is given, the linearized state space equations and the output equations for the district heating system at this point are obtained. Fig. 5 presents the system state space structure diagram by drawing the flowchart. Based on the input vector change δu generated by the controller and the state vector change δx of the system at the previous moment, the state vector change at the current moment is obtained by computing and accumulating the input matrix B and the state matrix A . The output variables of the system are fed back to the system input and integrated with the reference input of the system according to a specific proportional relationship. The integrated signal is used as the input of the system to control the system. Finally, the output vector change δy is obtained by solving the output matrix C and the transfer matrix D together. 5 Asynchronous time-scale optimal control method For optimal heating system operating parameters under variable load conditions, the inverter pump operation and valve opening frequency are directly adjusted in practical engineering. Traditional control methods are generally based on fixed node temperatures, and the stable control of the system state requires control strategies and control systems. The system structure diagram built based on the holistic model of the district heating system can reflect the influence of the system structure parameters and operating parameters on the system output, thus providing a reference for the system control design. Based on the state space, Fig. 6 shows the overall control strategy of asynchronous time-scale hierarchical optimization proposed in this paper for the heating system. Firstly, the optimal node temperature of each node at a long time scale is obtained based on the real-time heat load of the system, combined with the system's steady-state energy flow model and genetic algorithm. According to the deviation of the actual node temperature value from the optimized value, it is transferred to the multi-input/multi-output proportional controller to output the fluid heat capacity flow of the corresponding loop of the system to realize the regulation of the system control volume on a short time scale. At the same time, feedback can adjust the actual real node temperature based on the system state space equation. The overall real-time dynamic adjustment of the operating frequency of each variable frequency pump is carried out until the actual value of the node temperature is accurately tracked to the optimized temperature value, realizing the overall closed-loop dynamic control of the heating system. 5.1 Holistic optimization methods based on system constraints Combining the integrated model of the district heating system shown in Fig. 2 and applying Kirchhoff's law, the holistic energy transfer constraint equation for the system can be constructed as: (23) T h , i − T e = Q * ( R 1 + R 2 + R 3 + R 4 − 1 G 2 − 1 G 3 ) On the premise of ignoring mechanical and motor losses, the pump work consumed by the inverter pump is calculated by combining its flow rate and flow characteristics, fitted to the following expression: (24) P j = m g ( a j m 2 ρ 2 + b j m ρ + c j ) ( j = 1,2,3 ) where m is the supply flow rate of the heating circuit, kg/s; ρ w is the density of the return water, kg/m3; a, b, c are coefficients, and the pump performance power parameters are shown in Table 1 . Combining the above system constraints with the optimization objective of minimizing the total system power consumption, the objective function is expressed as: (25) min ( P ) = min ( P 1 + P 2 + P 3 ) The holistic flow and heat transfer constraint equations described above establish a direct link between the system operating, structural, and demand parameters and reflect the holistic physical characteristics of the system. This constraint always holds if the system structure is constant and is independent of the specific design requirements and optimization objectives. The optimum operating conditions that minimize the total system power consumption can be obtained for a given total system heat exchange. 5.2 Optimal node parameters based on genetic algorithms According to the above holistic model of the district heating system, it can be seen that the system operation process is coupled and influenced by each other, constituting a complex and variable non-linear system. Therefore, this system optimization problem is a typical multi-parameter non-linear optimization problem. Based on the fact that the genetic algorithm is a highly parallel stochastic adaptive search method, which can search in multiple regions of the solution space and jump out of the local optimum with a large probability, it has unique advantages in solving such problems. Therefore, this paper uses genetic algorithms to solve the energy minimization optimization problem for heating systems. To obtain good computational results and increase the computational rate of the procedure for finding the best by comparing different combinations of parameters, this paper determines the operational parameters used to solve the genetic algorithm: population size 200, crossover rate 0.9, variation rate 0.05, genetic generation 1000, selection operator for roulette selection, crossover operator for single point crossover, and variation operator for uniform variation. According to the research objectives of this paper, the demand parameters of this paper are the mass flow rate of the work mass of the three heating circuits ( G1, G2, G3) on the primary network, secondary network, and customer side, and the corresponding three node temperatures (T h,i, T c1,i, T c2,i). In the optimization process, the variables are selected within a reasonable range to avoid taking the variables to the limit of the set interval. At the same time, the search is carried out with the holistic energy transfer constraint equation of the system as the constraint to minimize the total system power consumption to find the optimal operating point that satisfies the holistic operating conditions of the system. For the actual district heating system, the heat transfer coefficient can be assumed to remain constant when the flow rate of the cold and hot fluids in the heat exchange station changes within a small range. Therefore, a given heat transfer area can be considered its heat transfer thermal conductance provided that KA 1, KA 2, and KA e remain constant in the optimization (unit: W/K), as shown in Table 1. Meanwhile, Fig. 7 shows the heat load variation curve of the district heating system. To study the effect of outdoor temperature variation on the operating node temperature of the system and to guide a more accurate optimum node temperature for the dynamic simulation control under the joint influence of load and outdoor temperature afterward. Therefore, Figs. 8 and 9 give the optimal temperature variation of each node under variable load conditions when the outdoor temperature is fixed as the average temperature of the day and when the outdoor temperature is the real-time temperature of the day, respectively. Under real-time load, changes in outdoor temperature have a non-negligible impact on the temperature of each operating node of the system. Therefore, under the control strategy of the heating system based on the optimized node temperature, the following dynamic simulation process should consider both the joint influence of the real-time load and the real-time outdoor temperature to obtain the optimal real-time system operating conditions and thus achieve the optimal control regulation of the system operating parameters. 5.3 Integral control method based on optimal node parameters Based on the dynamic model of the district heating system, a simulation system based on Matlab Simulink software can be constructed. The schematic diagram of this system is shown in Fig. 10 . The simulation system consists of four subsystems: the primary network heat exchange station subsystem, the secondary network heat exchange station subsystem, the customer side heat exchange station subsystem, and the indoor subsystem. The internal equations of each subsystem are based on the dynamic heat transfer model of the heat transfer system represented by Eq. (9). The dashed lines in the diagram connect the flow and temperature parameters between the subsystems, corresponding to each subsystem's input and output parameters. In addition, the indoor temperature is set according to user requirements, and the outdoor air flow G e is assumed to be infinite. Based on the above dynamic model of the district heating system, it is assumed that the heat and cold side thermal conductivity of each heat exchange station is 1500W/K, the indoor temperature (customer demand) is set at 18 °C and the outdoor temperature is selected from the real-time outdoor temperature (from the software Meteomorm) of a day in Beijing in winter. The heat capacity of each heat exchange station wall is 4000 W/K, and the indoor heat capacity is 1000 W/K. Based on the above method of optimizing the operation of the heating system based on variable loads, the state parameters of the heating system were calculated for stable operation at an initial load of 20000 W (G 1 = 795.3 W/K, G 2 = 999.7 W/K, G 3 = 2000.3 W/K; T c1,i = 46.3 °C, T c2,i = 37.4 °C), which leads to the system correlation matrices A , B , C, and D for this operating condition (26) A = [ − 0.0992 0.0982 0 0 0.1309 − 0.2878 0.1569 0 0 0.1569 − 0.3915 0.2346 0 0 0.176 − 0.6135 ] B = 10 − 3 [ − 4.2000 0 0 5.5000 − 1.1000 0 0 1.1000 − 0.8483 0 0 0.6362 ] C = [ 1.0000 0 0 0 0 0.0293 0.9707 0 0 0 0.1481 0.8519 ] D = [ 0 0 0 0 0.0077 0 0 0 0.0052 ] According to the system controllability discriminant matrix M to determine the controllability of the system, the calculated matrix M is full rank, indicating that the heating system state is fully controllable through the control system input (heat capacity flow G 1, G 2, G 3), can control the system output (node temperature T h,i, T c1,i, T c2,i) to track the optimized set value, to achieve real-time control of the node temperature under each dynamic load conditions. (27) M = [ B A B A 2 B . . . A n − 1 B ] A multivariable coupled proportional-integral controller is designed based on the dynamic energy space equations of the heating system for the characteristics of the district heating system with multiple inputs (work heat capacity flows G 1, G 2, G 3) and multiple outputs (node temperatures T h,i, T c1,i, T c2,i). In addition, the integral control link can effectively eliminate the system's steady-state deviation and enhance control robustness. When the deviation of real-time values of node temperatures T h,i, T c1,i, T c2,i from the set values is transferred to the controller, the controller outputs the changes of heat capacity flow ΔG 1, ΔG 2, ΔG 3, which are added with the initial heat capacity flow G 1,ini, G 2,ini, G 3,ini, to get the actual control results G 1, G 2, G 3, providing real-time operation control parameters for the heating system. At the same time, the heat capacity changes ΔG 1, ΔG 2, ΔG 3 are transferred as inputs to the established state space equations Eqs. (21) and (22) to output the corresponding changes in the temperature of the nodes of the controlled quantity ΔT h, ΔT c1, ΔT c2, which in turn feeds back into the initial inputs of the system to add up with the actual values of the node temperatures T h-real, T c1-real, T c2-real, until the controlling node temperatures real values are accurately tracked to the system-optimized node temperature setpoints T h-set, T c1-set, T c2-set, thus realizing the closed-loop dynamic control of the whole heating system. The multi-variable coupled proportional integral controller enables real-time optimization of node temperature tracking to achieve optimum performance under the dynamic processes of the overall heating system. Fig. 11 shows the schematic diagram of this controller. The subscripts set and real denote the set and real-time values of temperature, respectively, and ini denotes the initial value of flow. Where K is the feedback gain matrix, whose value can be obtained according to the place function in Matlab given the state matrix A , the input matrix B, and the closed-loop poles of the system state, the method requires that the poles cannot be in the zero position, so the closed-loop poles are set to (−0.1, −0.2, −0.3, −0.4) in this example, and the algorithm constrains the actual poles of the closed-loop system to deviate from the desired poles The deviation value of the closed-loop system is within 10 %, so that K is (28) K = [ − 27.4436 5.7503 4.0501 − 5.7628 − 128.5498 34.0019 − 54.8353 − 85.1704 − 132.9138 − 58.0294 192.5045 − 433.3000 ] During the simulation, Fig. 7 presents the heat load variation curve of the heating system on a typical day. To observe the dynamic control characteristics of this closed-loop control system, as the setpoint of the temperature at each node is continuously varied in steps, the dynamic response tracking curve of the process value is shown in Fig. 12 . The maximum dynamic deviation between the set value and the actual value at each node is 0.5 °C. The steady-state adjustment time of the system is within the 80s, which shows that the feedback control system has good stability and rapidity. By adjusting the mass flow rate to achieve real-time control of the node temperature under dynamic variable load conditions, the overall operation control of the heating system is achieved based on optimized node parameters. Fig. 13 also shows the dynamic response curves for each mass flow rate. 5.4 Control results and discussions Fixed node temperature control operation methods are commonly used in practical heating engineering and are often set artificially based on engineering experience. Therefore, in addition to the indoor temperature setting, the nodal temperatures Th,i, Tc1,i and Tc2,i need to be controlled and are set to 80 °C, 46.3 °C and 37.4 °C respectively in the simulation based on the optimized temperature corresponding to the initial load of the system. Meanwhile, based on the above nodal temperature operation optimization method, the system can be operated according to the optimal nodal temperature control corresponding to the joint influence of real-time thermal load and outdoor temperature variation, as shown in Fig. 9. It can be seen that as the heat load of the heating system and the outdoor temperature change, the corresponding node temperature also changes, with the fluctuation ranges of Th,i, Tc1,i and Tc2,i ranging from 80.03 to 83.2 °C, 43.12\u201346.35 °C and 34.32\u201337.4 °C, respectively. The trends of the mass flow rates of the three fluids in the three heating circuits of the system with fluctuations in load and outdoor temperature are given in Figs. 14\u201316 , respectively (see Figs. 14\u201316). Table 2 gives the average values of the fluid mass flow rates for each loop. It can be seen that in the optimized nodal temperature guided system control, the mass flow rate of the primary network heating loop increases by approximately 6 % compared to the fixed nodal temperature, while both the secondary network and the customer side heating loop decrease by approximately 17.4 % and 35.4 % compared to the fixed nodal temperature. Based on the mass flow rate of the working fluid in each circuit, the total pump work of the heating system can be determined in conjunction with the network characteristics of the heating system. Fig. 17 gives the curve of the total pump work of the heating system with time for a typical day application at fixed and optimized nodal temperatures. During the simulation period, the average pump power of the heating system is 359.9 W when controlled at a fixed node temperature and 268.6 W when controlled at an optimized node temperature, resulting in an average energy saving of 25.4 %. It can be seen that the control strategy based on optimizing the node temperature will result in a local increase in flow rate, but will reduce the total energy consumption of the system, i.e. sacrificing a local performance to improve the holistic performance of the system. Moreover, considering the heating system a typical irreversible process between the heating system and the outdoor environment, we introduce the exergy loss I = T0ΔSg to compare the efficiency of the proposed new method. Herein, the expression for the entropy production Sg [18] of the heat exchanger can be calculated by Eq. (28) (28) S g = G h ln [ 1 − 1 R s G h ( 1 − ( T c , i T h , i ) ) ] + G c ln [ 1 − 1 R s G c ( 1 − ( T h , i T c , i ) ) ] where T 0 is the outdoor temperature, selected as the real-time outdoor temperature of a typical day in winter. R s is the same as Eq. (2), T h/c, G h/c are the inlet temperature of hot and cold fluids and heat capacity, respectively. For the integrated model of the heating system constructed based on standardized thermal resistance. Fig. 18 presents and compares the exergy destruction in one day under fixed/optimized operating conditions of the heating system. The holistic system exergy loss under the optimized condition is always lower than that under the fixed condition. The system heat efficiency under the optimized condition increases by 2.3 % in one day compared to the fixed condition, with the highest heat efficiency being 4.5 %. 6 Conclusions Load fluctuations and real-time outdoor temperature can combine to affect the dynamic control of district heating systems. In this paper, the steady-state and dynamic energy state spaces of the multi-loop heating system are constructed for the centralized heating system, the corresponding state space parameter matrices are derived, and the logical relationships between the control parameters of the district heating system are analyzed. By combining the overall heat current model of the system with the genetic algorithm, we obtained the optimal node temperature. On this basis, an asynchronous time-scale overall control strategy based on the optimal node parameters is proposed. Finally, a multi-input, multi-output proportional controller is applied through Matlab Simulink system simulation. A state observer of this closed-loop system is constructed to verify the feasibility of the control strategy and the dynamic control characteristics of the feedback control system are also observed. Simulation results of the control of the district heating system under variable operating conditions show that the system control guided by the optimized node temperature is approximately 25.4 % more energy efficient than the fixed node temperature, and the overall improvement in the efficiency of the breakdown is 2.3 % relative to the fixed operating conditions. A closed-loop state observer is constructed based on a multivariable coupled proportional-integral controller. The control process of the heating system based on the optimized node temperature is observed under variable operating conditions. The observation results show that the control strategy can guide the heating system to achieve closed-loop dynamic control and the best performance under the dynamic process of the overall heating system. The maximum dynamic deviation between the set value and the actual value for each node temperature in successive steps is within 0.5 °C, and the steady-state regulation time is within 80 s, which verifies the feasibility of the control strategy.

        "dc:description": "Optimal characteristic parameters and control strategies in the operation of urban heating systems are significant for carbon reduction and high efficiency. Considering load fluctuations and real-time outdoor temperature changes, this research constructs steady-state and dynamic heat current models of the heating system based on the standard thermal resistance model. Combined with genetic algorithms, an optimal setting method is proposed for the operating characteristic parameters of the heating system under variable operating conditions. To achieve the control of the optimal characteristic parameters, the dynamic heat current model is applied to derive the system energy state space equations and obtain the state space parameter matrix. Moreover, a holistic control strategy for the heating system based on the optimal node parameters is proposed. The control simulation results show that the proposed holistic control strategy based on the optimal node temperature can save energy by 25.4 % compared with the fixed node temperature. Meanwhile, the exergy efficiency of the heating system increases by 2.3 %. That is, the proposed asynchronous time-scale holistic control method is significant for the day-ahead optimal regulation strategy of the district heating system.",
