Department of Electrical Power Engineering and Mechatronics Tallinn University of Technology Estonia Increasing use of volatile renewable energy sources causes challenges in balancing supply and demand. Therefore, demand-side flexibility has rising importance for system operators and balancing authorities. Flexibility management methods are needed to integrate loads like ventilation systems of different buildings (e.g., residential and commercial) into flexibility service. However, the available methods described in research papers require further development for implementation in practice. Heating and cooling systems have received much attention from researchers, but the potential of ventilation systems has been left out of focus. Therefore, this paper provides a complete set of novel flexibility management methods for ventilation systems created from an aggregator's viewpoint. The flexibility is quantified through capacity (e.i. the amount of power consumption that can be altered), forced ventilation rate duration, and the tendered price for the service. The proposed methods were tested on a building model constructed and simulated in IDA ICE. The data processing and flexibility management methods were applied in MATLAB. Two types of ventilation systems with different sensor configurations were considered: constant and variable air volume. Forced ventilation rate duration is calculated using energy and mass balance analysis where the root means squared error was 10 to 33 min, depending on the system type, measured parameter, and sensor location. The flexibility service pricing model was tested on the 2022 years' manual frequency restoration reserve (mFRR) activation and balance energy market data.

Renewable Energy Directive [1] will force member states to fulfill at least 32% of overall energy needs with renewable energy by 2030. The long-term strategy is stated by European Green Deal [2], which aims to become the first climate-neutral continent by 2050. According to the Eurostat [3], the share of renewable energy consumption in gross final energy consumption during ten year period from 2010 to 2020 has increased from 14.4% to 22.1% in the EU, while in Estonia, renewable energy share during the same period has increased from 24.6% to 30.2%. This share is increased by dedicated power plants and households with small-scale photovoltaic energy production or wind turbines, as considered in [4]. Increasing the share of distributed volatile renewable energy generation makes maintaining the equilibrium between supply and demand increasingly challenging. This raises the importance of demand response and energy flexibility managed by aggregators, as described in [5]. Electric power system flexibility is the ability to continuously balance the grid by maintaining electricity supply and demand on an equal level [6] while simultaneously providing acceptable service quality to connected loads [7]. Flexibility in an electric system can be characterized through multiple features related to how the flexibility is provided or properties that can be used to quantify the flexibility, as discussed in [8]. Authors of the review [9] differentiated demand-side flexibility into two: implicit and explicit demand flexibility. The implicit demand flexibility takes advantage of indirect or price-based demand response, where consumers change their electricity consumption according to the energy price at a given time. For example, methods described in [10,11] use implicit demand flexibility to achieve cost savings on energy purchases. Under explicit demand flexibility, the committed flexibility providers adjust their energy generation or consumption according to the electric system's needs, as described in [12]. Individual participation can be considered in explicit demand flexibility services for large prosumers. In all other cases, aggregation is needed to concentrate multiple prosumers' ability to change their consumption or generation to fulfill all the requirements stated by the market operator [13,9]. Therefore, flexibility management, including algorithms and appropriate equipment, is essential for the current and future energy system [14\u201316]. It has been suggested in the vision of Smart Grids to harness the positive effects of aggregated residential load flexibility in electricity markets [17,18]. Demand flexibility is not only considered for residential buildings but also includes commercial or industrial sectors, where one approach is discussed in the study [19]. In buildings, mechanical ventilation systems are a possible source of flexibility which according to the European Commission [20], consume more than 2% of the energy produced in the European Union. After heating, cooling, and lighting, they are currently the fourth biggest electricity consumer in buildings. The share of ventilation in the energy balance of buildings is expected to increase as the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) [21] proposal of March 14, 2023, sets requirements for the implementation of adequate indoor environmental quality standards in buildings in order to maintain a healthy indoor climate, which most likely increases the total capacity of mechanical ventilation. The proposal also states that various indoor environment parameters shall be continuously measured and used for control in buildings, including CO2, temperature, and relative humidity. The indoor sources of particulate matter or volatile organic compounds (VOC) are either reported based on the available data at the product level or directly measured where available. The requirements of the EPBD proposal include zero emission, new and existing buildings undergoing a major renovation, and the majority of existing non-residential and public buildings. Therefore, the readiness to utilize building service systems in the coming decades should increase remarkably. The study [22] found that ventilation alone can form up to 12% of the overall energy consumption in office buildings. Heating, cooling, and lighting system energy consumption depends on ambient conditions, as shown in [23], while a ventilation system's power consumption is related to building usage. Therefore, ventilation systems experience fewer seasonal effects on energy flexibility and can be included in the flexibility service throughout the year. In Estonia, according to the 2022 year manual frequency restoration reserve (mFRR) activations, the average energy used during up-regulation was around 8.7 MWh [24]. The maximum energy used in regulations during the same period was 98.9 MWh. According to the Estonian transmission system operator (TSO) Elering AS [25], the average hourly energy consumption during 2022 was 934 MWh. It is known that ventilation systems consume at least 2% of the total energy produced in the EU, meaning that the maximum potential of ventilation systems is to provide around 19MWh of energy for flexibility service. It is more than the average energy used during a regulation. Therefore, ventilation systems can have a relatively high potential to provide flexibility. Research interest has grown in recent years in the field of energy flexibility and harvesting it from heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. However, as shown in research papers [26\u201332], the main focus is on the heating and cooling system considering temperature as the primary indoor environment quality parameter. Much research is done to reduce energy consumption and costs by implementing optimization methods (e.g., mixed integer linear programming) [33\u201336] or addressing demand response by taking advantage of time-of-use tariffs or real-time electricity price [37\u201339]. Authors of the research [39] reported that electricity consumption could be decreased by 9% and the electricity purchase costs by 2% by implementing demand response and using a real-time price signal on an educational office building's ventilation system. Another ventilation system's demand response approach is considered in [40], where a study was made for a commercial building to minimize the energy and thermal discomfort costs related to occupants. The HVAC system used for frequency service is studied in [41]. It found that up to 15% of the rated fan power can be implemented in frequency regulation without substantially affecting the building's indoor temperature. Temperature is an essential indoor air quality parameter, but from an energy flexibility standpoint, CO2 concentration is the primary parameter to measure the ventilation system's flexibility [42]. Residential buildings can have an important role in providing demand-side flexibility. For example, O. W. Olawale, B. Gilbert, and J. Reyna [43] assessed the residential participants' behavior in demand flexibility programs and estimated that residential participants could provide up to 10 GW for flexibility service in the United States. In addition, the authors of the review [44] found that the most popular resources for flexibility services in the residential sector are thermal energy storage and electric appliances. They reported in the review that the energy cost is reduced by 1% to 48% with flexible operations. The study [45] found that flexibility potential in new residential districts is around 290 W per household with an uncertainty of ± 90 W and around 1290 W per old building. Coordination and negotiation techniques to manage demand-side flexibility are discussed in the study [46], where game theory was the most widely used technique in residential districts. Authors of the research [47] proposed a space heating coordination strategy to provide flexibility service and reported a 13.96% reduction in operation costs. Characterization and quantification of flexibility are needed to aggregate flexible loads in the scope of explicit demand flexibility. In addition, an important role is played by forecasts and system control. Therefore, flexible load management can be divided into the following parts: \u2022 Quantification is needed to measure the flexibility and provide metrics for the aggregator. However, flexibility cannot be quantified through a single metric, so multiple properties, such as capacity, delay, and duration, are considered [8]. Y. Chen et al. [48] have discussed some of the equations to quantify flexibility, but these mainly apply to heating and cooling systems. After all, the composition of the properties is dictated by the aggregator and selected aggregation method. \u2022 Forecasting is an essential part of flexibility service to schedule flexible loads and ensure regulation readiness. Short-term forecasts (e.i., from hours to one day or a week) are used to submit tenders to the market operator [49]. \u2022 The interface is a composition of methods, rules, and hardware to communicate with an aggregator and control flexible loads. This can also include building-level aggregation, where tenders from the whole building's flexible loads are combined and submitted. If an aggregator sends an activation signal, the interface must deliver the required capacity within time constraints. The studied literature does not give a complete package of methods to manage ventilation system energy flexibility. Furthermore, the available methods are too complicated to implement or lack a guideline for the building owners or aggregators to implement these on their systems. The available research focuses mainly on heating and cooling, while ventilation systems are left out of scope. This paper addresses these problems and proposes methods to manage ventilation system flexibility, which enables the use of ventilation systems in flexibility service. In addition, this paper bridges the gap in research by providing methods and approaches to measure duration and cope with different sensor configurations for ventilation systems. Also, the step-by-step process for co-simulation between two simulation platforms is given. The paper is organized as follows: in section 2, flexibility management methods are described; section 3 gives an overview of the building model and dataset which was used for the validation of the methods; section 4 shows the results of the validation, and in section 5 acquired results are discussed. 2 Developed flexibility management methods The properties of electrical flexibility must be understood before management methods can be applied. Electrical flexibility can be expressed through three attributes: direction, availability, and electrical composition [8,50,51]. Each property has a specific role in flexibility service: \u2022 The direction can have two states: up or down. The direction of regulation is specified from the grid's perspective. If the power consumption is decreased, then up-regulation is initiated, and vice versa. \u2022 The availability can be defined by the starting time and duration, as shown in Fig. 1 . The starting time will mark the moment when the regulation is initiated. The duration defines the time window required for regulation and within the power consumption level that can be sustained without exceeding set boundaries. \u2022 The electrical composition can be described through power or capacity, which defines how much power can be used for flexibility service. The total energy used for flexibility service can be calculated by combining duration with power. Ventilation systems that use variable frequency drives have ramps in the power consumption, which can be seen as falling and rising proportions in Fig. 1. This can be named a rate of change and must be considered when a selected system is included in the flexibility service. 2.1 Capacity forecasting The capacity for each timestep can be calculated based on the system's maximum and minimum power consumption, which can be acquired experimentally or by consulting the documentation. For example, the available power for down-regulation and up-regulation can be calculated from the maximum and minimum possible power consumption, as shown in (1). The sign (+ or -) in front of the value dictates the direction of the regulation. To achieve this, power consumption must be forecasted for each timestep. (1) Δ P t = P max - P t , down regulation P min - P t , up regulation , where Δ P t \u2013 available capacity for up or down regulations at timestep t (kW), P t \u2013 forecasted power consumption for timestep t (kW), P m a x \u2013 maximum measured or given by documentation power consumption (kW), P m i n \u2013 minimum measured or given by documentation power consumption (kW). A ventilation system usually operates according to a schedule that is adjusted based on the building's usage. During unoccupied hours the ventilation system is switched off or operating at a minimum airflow rate. There can be minor fluctuations in power consumption which increase the uncertainty of the forecast. For forecasting, the autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model is used. ARMA model terms p and q will be selected using the Akaike information criterion (AIC) method. The power consumption forecast is based on previously measured power consumption data and not on a ventilation system type or configuration. ARMA model for forecasting the power consumption of a ventilation system can be described as follows: (2) P t = α + ∑ i = 1 p β i P t - i + ε t + ∑ i = 1 q ϕ i ε t - i , where α \u2013 ARMA model constant, β i \u2013 AR coefficient for the lag i, P t - i \u2013 AR model power consumption lag, p \u2013 the order for the AR model, ε t \u2013 error terms, ϕ i \u2013 MA coefficient for the lag i, ε t - i \u2013 MA model error lag, q \u2013 the order for the MA model. 2.2 Duration forecasting During regulations, a ventilation system is forced to operate below or above its regular rate, allowing it to decrease or increase its power consumption. This paper defines this state as forced ventilation rate (FVR). However, this state cannot be sustained indefinitely because it affects the building's indoor air quality (IAQ). This subsection discusses a method to estimate and forecast the FVR duration. The same approach is also addressed in the study [52], where experimentation was conducted on one ventilation system of an educational building. The proposed method assumes a mixing type of ventilation system. A forecast is based on three main IAQ parameters: CO2 concentration, temperature, and humidity. Each parameter has its limit condition and nuances in the duration calculation. The indoor climate of a building is mainly dictated by three indoor air quality (IAQ) parameters: CO2 concentration, temperature, and humidity. To provide occupants with a healthy and comfortable environment, these three parameters must be between limits given in the standard EN16798:2019 [53]. Authors of the study [54] suggest placing sensors in both the supply and return air ducts actively monitor contamination or temperature difference. The drawback of this setup is that during the ventilation shutdown, the state of IAQ is unknown, and contamination or temperature can exceed the limits. In addition, placing sensors in each room or space of the building requires higher investment costs and a complex sensor network. 2.2.1 CO2 concentration Due to metabolism, persons produce carbon dioxide, which causes the CO2 concentration in a zone to rise and is correlated with other bioeffluents. Based on the standard EN 12831\u20131, a zone is a group of rooms with direct or indirect air connection. Without sufficient ventilation, the CO2 concentration can rise above the allowable limit. However, since this will not happen instantly, the ventilation system can operate at the minimum level for some time. CO2 concentration-based flexibility duration estimation uses mass balance analysis to calculate the CO2 generation rate in a building which can be used for duration calculation. Mass balance can be expressed as follows: (3) V dC dt = G + Q C amb - Q C , where V \u2013 air volume in a zone (m3), C \u2013 CO2 concentration in a zone (ppm), G \u2013 CO2 generation rate (m3/s), Q \u2013 airflow rate for the zone (m3/s), C amb \u2013 ambient CO2 concentration (ppm). The CO2 generation rate during the timestep t can be calculated as shown in (4). This equation is derived from the previously mentioned mass balance and is put into a discrete form more suitable for a control system. FVR duration calculation and forecasting are discussed under 2.2.4. The same methods can be used for other pollutants, such as particulate matter and VOCs, since they are also measured in relative values (e.i., the concentration of particles) and subject to mass balance. (4) G t c o 2 = V · ( C t - C t - 1 ) Δ t + Q t · ( C t - C amb ) , where Δt \u2013 timestep length (s). 2.2.2 Temperature Building ventilation systems can provide thermal comfort to occupants or hold set temperatures for other purposes, which means that when the ventilation system is used for flexibility service, the temperature effect should be included in estimations. In addition, the standard EN 16798-1:2019 specifies temperature ranges according to building type, which can be used in the estimations. The first law of thermodynamics can be used to estimate energy flows into or out of a zone, as expressed in (5). The difference between the initial and final states of the zone can be expressed through multiple mass flows with uniform properties [55], also adding the heat q generation by people, appliances, and room heating. Mechanical work w can be excluded from the equation because the zone is not doing any mechanical work, and all the energy used by appliances is converted into heat. (5) ∑ m i n u + p V + v 2 2 + g z in - ∑ m o u t u + p V + v 2 2 + g z out + q - w = m final u + v 2 2 + g z final - m initial u + v 2 2 + g z initial zone , where m in \u2013 the mass of the entering medium (kg), m out \u2013 the mass of leaving medium (kg), m final \u2013 the final mass of a zone (kg), m initial \u2013 the initial mass of a zone (kg), u \u2013 internal energy per unit mass (J/kg), p \u2013 pressure (Pa), V \u2013 specific volume (m3), v \u2013 velocity of molecules (m/s), g \u2013 local acceleration of gravity (m/s2), z \u2013 elevation above the horizontal reference plane (m), q \u2013 heat generated inside a zone (J), w \u2013 energy converted into work (J). A ventilation system can be considered the only way entering and leaving airflow streams can move. All the other mass flows through openings, and walls can be considered in one variable: heat. From (5), only mass internal energy u is needed to estimate the heat generation in a zone, while pressure, volume, velocity, and potential energy have no significant difference. A heat generation rate must be calculated to estimate ventilation system flexibility based on temperature, as shown in (6). FVR duration calculation and forecasting are discussed under 2.2.4. (6) G t heat = V · T t - T t - 1 Δ t + Q t · T t - T s u p p l y , where T t \u2013 temperature in a zone at timestep t (K), T t - 1 \u2013 the temperature at the previous timestep t − 1 (K), T supply \u2013 supply air temperature (K), Q t \u2013 ventilation rate at timestep t (m3/s), Δt\u2013 timestep length (s), V \u2013 zone volume (m3). 2.2.3 Humidity The humidity is affected by persons inside the building where moisture is added to inhaled air during exhaling. Also, washing and drying release additional moisture into the inside air. Typically ventilation system is responsible for extracting excess moisture from the building. This means that the humidity effect should be included in estimations when the ventilation system is used for flexibility service. Commercially available humidity sensors typically measure relative humidity, thus outputting a value that is a percentage of the measured absolute humidity against maximum absolute humidity at a given temperature. However, relative humidity depends on air temperature, which means that relative humidities for entering and leaving air are not comparable due to temperature differences. This issue is resolved by converting the relative humidity level into absolute (g/m3), which can be calculated as follows: (7) W = B · C · R H · 10 m · T T + T n 100 · T , where T - the temperature of the air (K), RH - the relative humidity, B , C , m , T n \u2013 constants which are given in Table 1 [56]. Like the CO2 concentration estimation, the humidity level inside the building can be estimated by mass balance analysis, as shown in (3). In addition, the humidity generation rate can be calculated, as shown in (8). FVR duration calculation and forecasting are discussed under 2.2.4. (8) G t w = V · W t - W t - 1 Δ t + Q t · W t - W s u p p l y , where W t \u2013 humidity concentration in a zone at timestep t (g/m3), W supply \u2013 supply air humidity concentration (g/m3). 2.2.4 Forced ventilation rate duration calculation Knowing an IAQ parameter X generation rate at a given timestep t, estimation for ventilation system FVR duration can be made as shown in (9). The main restriction for the FVR duration when the ventilation system is operating at lowered power consumption is the boundary condition for the IAQ parameter. There is no lower limit for CO2 concentration excess above outdoor concentration. This means there is no limitation from the CO2 concentration perspective to increasing ventilation system power consumption. Although, it must be considered that if, at design conditions, the fan speed is not at the maximum frequency control setpoint, increasing the fan speed above the design value may cause problems with noise or draught. This does not apply to the temperature and humidity range the parameter must be within. Therefore, it must be known what purpose the ventilation system has in addition to air exchange. For example, if the ventilation system is responsible for building heating or indoor air humidification, this must be considered in the duration calculation. This is done by calculating multiple FVR durations for the same parameter and selecting the shortest. (9) τ t X = V · X limit - X t G t X - Q f v r · X t + X l i m i t - 2 · X s u p p l y 2 , where X t \u2013 IAQ parameter value in a zone at timestep t (ppm, °C or g/m3), X limit \u2013 IAQ parameter limit (ppm, °C or g/m3), Q f v r \u2013 forced ventilation rate (m3/s). The FVR duration calculated in (9) is an instantaneous value considering conditions measured during the timestep t. It is not helpful when the forecast for future FVR durations is needed. Therefore, ARMA(p, q) model can be used to calculate future values based on historical data. The ARMA(p, q) model is described in (2), where the power consumption must be replaced with the FVR duration. The FVR duration forecast must be adjusted according to IAQ parameter generation rate fluctuations. If the subsequent timestep room usage increases, the FVR duration must be shortened as described by (10). This will eliminate overoptimistic estimations where in an actual situation, the FVR can be sustained for a shorter time, or the IAQ parameters will exceed their limits. Each of these adjustments is repeated, and after each iteration, the sum of all FVR duration estimations is calculated and compared with the previous iteration sum, as shown in (11). If they are equal, then the adjustment is completed. (10) τ t , i FVR = τ t + 1 , i - 1 FVR + Δ t , τ t + 1 , i - 1 FVR < τ t , i - 1 FVR - Δ t τ t , i - 1 FVR , τ t + 1 , i - 1 FVR ⩾ τ t , i - 1 FVR - Δ t (11) ∑ t = 1 n τ t , i FVR = ∑ t = 1 n τ t , i - 1 FVR where τ t , i fvr \u2013 an estimate of FVR duration at time t during correction iteration i, τ t , i - 1 fvr \u2013 an estimate of FVR duration at time t during correction iteration i − 1, Δt\u2013 timestep length (s). 2.2.5 Boundary condition correction One building can consist of multiple zones, each with multiple rooms. To estimate FVR duration, building usage and conditions inside must be known. In many cases, this is causing the need to install additional IAQ sensors in the building. One way to reduce the initial investment costs is to install IAQ sensors in the air handling unit (AHU). However, measurements in the AHU do not represent the actual situation in each room. The pollutant concentration in the AHU for mixing type of ventilation system is the average value for all the zones, as shown in (12). If there are zones with uneven usage, then it can cause a situation where boundary conditions will be exceeded. It is especially troublesome if the ventilation system is forced to operate at its minimum rate. To lessen the flexibility service effect on IAQ and make FVR less noticeable, the solution is restricting ventilation system exploitation and correcting the boundary condition. It is done by narrowing the range where the IAQ parameter can be. (12) X return = ∑ i = 1 n X i Q i Q return , where X return \u2013 IAQ parameter value in return air (ppm, °C or g/m3), X i \u2013 IAQ parameter value in room i (ppm, °C or g/m3), Q i \u2013 airflow rate from the room i (m3/s), Q return \u2013 airflow rate in the return air duct (m3/s), n \u2013 total number of rooms. Occupancy in each room must be measured or estimated to consider uneven occupancy in flexibility calculation. It can be achieved by installing temporary IAQ sensors in rooms of interest and taking measurements for at least one week during normal building usage (i.e., avoid holidays). It is recommended to take repeated measurements at least once a year or after the change in buildings' room usage (i.e., change of tenant). After the measurements are taken, it is possible to estimate pollutant generation or heat generation according to the floor area of selected rooms, known as specific pollutant generation (SPG). Therefore, the SPG for CO2 is defined as (m3/s)/m2, SPG for temperature is defined as W/m2, and SPG for humidity is defined as (g/s)/m2. All the SPGs are calculated according to the CO2 generation formula as shown in (4), heat generation as shown in (6), and humidity generation as shown in (8). IAQ parameter limit value can be corrected based on acquired SPGs. The room with the highest SPG for the selected IAQ parameter defines the corrected limit value. Also, rooms are not used equally throughout one day, and the room with maximum SPG can change. Therefore, it is reasonable to calculate the corrected limit value for each timestep. First, the corrected limit value is calculated based on the difference between the upper and lower IAQ parameter limit values multiplied by the room airflow rate and SPG for the selected IAQ parameter. Then, the acquired value is divided by the return airflow rate and the zone's average SPG for all of the rooms in this zone and biased by the IAQ parameter lower limit, which can be calculated as follows: (13) X t limit = X low limit + X high limit - X low limit · Q t room · SPG t room Q t r e t u r n · SPG t zone , where X t limit \u2013 IAQ parameter limit (ppm, °C, or g/m3), X low limit \u2013 IAQ parameter lower limit value (ppm, °C, or g/m3), X high limit \u2013 IAQ parameter upper limit value (ppm, °C, or g/m3), Q t room \u2013 airflow rate from the room (m3/s), SPG t room \u2013 specific pollutant generation for a room [(m3/s)/m2, W/m2 or (g/s)/m2], Q t return \u2013 airflow rate in the return air duct (m3/s), SPG t zone \u2013 specific pollutant generation for a zone [(m3/s)/m2, W/m2 or (g/s)/m2]. 2.3 Implementation of methods Flexibility management methods depend on available measurement data and what is needed for aggregation. This section presents the pricing model and describes the implementation of the developed methods. 2.3.1 Pricing model The last calculation stage is to find out the energy price for regulations. It is the needed input for the aggregator according to which the amount of regulated energy will be compensated to a building owner. A personalized pricing mechanism is used, as shown in (14). The direction of regulation dictates the ingredients of the final regulation price. If up-regulation is activated and the ventilation system power consumption is lowered, it is needed to compensate for lower IAQ in the zone. It can be done by considering variable building usage, described through the CO2 generation rate. If the building has low usage, then the cost of regulation is lower, and vice versa. Every regulation introduces changes in the ventilation system, which can contribute to amortization and must be compensated (e.g., switching of contactors, movement of valves, etc.). Amortization costs are neglected in the simulation since these are insignificant for the small-scale system. The down-regulation activation causes additional energy consumption, which introduces costs to the system owner. If the ventilation system's return air CO2 concentration is higher than the minimum possible CO2 concentration, the goal is to decrease the CO2 concentration level by purchasing electricity at a lower price. When the CO2 concentration is low due to the low occupancy, down-regulation can only be provided if additional costs from grid fees, taxes, and amortization are compensated. Also, the profit margin is included in the regulation price that the building owner dictates. (14) pric e t = G t c o 2 G m a x c o 2 · c comf · τ t + c amort Δ P t · τ t + c prof , Δ P t < 0 C t - C t , m i n C l i m i t - C t , m i n · c t , e l - c t , f e e s - c amort Δ P t · τ t - c prof , Δ P t > 0 , where price t \u2013 the calculated regulation price at time t (\u20ac/MWh), G t c o 2 \u2013 CO2 generation rate at time t (m3/s), G m a x c o 2 \u2013 maximum estimated CO2 generation rate (m3/s), c comf \u2013 the regulation cost on comfort (\u20ac/h), τ t \u2013 duration of regulation at time t (h), c amort \u2013 the regulation cost on amortization (\u20ac), c prof \u2013 profit margin for regulations (\u20ac/MWh), ΔP t \u2013 available capacity during the timestep t (kW), C t \u2013 CO2 concentration in the return air at time t (ppm), C t , m i n \u2013 minimum CO2 concentration for maximum airflow rate at time t (ppm), C limit \u2013 CO2 concentration limit value (ppm), c t , e l \u2013 electricity price including electricity market price and electricity supplier the profit margin at time t (\u20ac/MWh), c t , f e e s \u2013 the sum of all the fees, which include transmission costs and taxes added to consumed energy price at time t (\u20ac/MWh). The forced ventilation rate duration estimation dictates the maximum duration for each regulation. The regulation price is calculated for each period separately. Therefore, the duration of each regulation can be derived as follows: (15) τ t = τ t FVR , τ t FVR ⩽ Δ t Δ t , τ t FVR > Δ t , where τ t FVR \u2013 forced ventilation rate duration at time t (h), Δt\u2013 duration between two sequent calculation steps (h). For down-regulations, the minimum possible CO2 concentration and CO2 concentration at a specific time must be estimated ahead. These can be derived from mass balance analysis, as shown in (16) and (17). Minimum CO2 concentration depends on the maximum airflow and CO2 generation rates at a selected time. The CO2 generation rate can be forecasted using the calculated CO2 generation rate shown in (4) with ARMA(p, q) model. (16) C t , m i n = G t c o 2 Q m a x + C amb , G t c o 2 > 0 C amb , G t c o 2 ⩽ 0 , where Q m a x \u2013 maximum ventilation rate (m3/s).

Flexibility management consists of capacity forecasts, FVR duration forecasts, and regulation prices for the next prediction horizon (Fig. 2 ). All previously discussed methods must be put into use to achieve this. Different sources of data are used for flexibility management. Real-time data will be gathered directly from sensors and a ventilation system interface. Static data will be acquired from the building's design documentation, ventilation system datasheet, and building owner. Information from the energy supplier is only needed when down regulations are allowed. All the forecasts are sent to the aggregator, who decides when and how much capacity will be activated. Finally, the activation signal is sent to the flexibility management system, which must achieve the requested power consumption change by forcing the ventilation system to operate at a specific rate. 3 Building model and simulation dataset A building model and development environment are needed to validate the flexibility management methods and acquire the results. The building model is constructed in IDA Indoor Climate and Energy (IDA ICE), a specialized simulation tool to imitate building behavior. IDA ICE has been validated according to EN 15255:2007, EN 15265:2007, EN 13791, and ASHRAE 140-2004. Reports about test results for validation are available on the EQUA Simulation AB website [57]. MATLAB programming and numeric computing platform are used for scripting, data analysis, and applying flexibility management methods. All the results are acquired by combining IDA ICE with MATLAB. The whole validation process for the developed flexibility management methods can be divided into five stages (Fig. 3 ): I. The building model is configured, and the occupancy schedule is generated. PRN files are used to transfer data between IDA ICE and MATLAB. II. A year-long simulation is conducted in IDA ICE using all the needed input and the building model. All the measured data gathered from each room and AHU is logged into output files. III. All the IDA ICE output files are imported into MATLAB, and flexibility management methods are applied. It includes the quantification and forecasting of the ventilation system's energy flexibility. Activations are scheduled based on the 2022 Estonian balancing energy price, day-ahead price, and manual frequency restoration reserve (mFRR) activations. IV. A year-long simulation is repeated with activations. V. The data is acquired for IDA ICE, and previously calculated flexibility estimations are compared with measured data. Finally, the dataset is analyzed in MATLAB, and the final results are formulated. 3.1 The building model The building model is based on a small single-family house, a sample building used for redefining the cost-optimality level for new, nearly zero-energy residential buildings in Estonia [58]. The model has been validated previously in a related project, and the relevant documentation is available online [59\u201363]. The building model represents a single-floor level dwelling with a total floor area of around 100 m2 and can be considered a typical Estonian single-family house according to the statistics [71]. The building is separated into 11 rooms (Fig. 4 ) connected to one AHU with heat recovery. The building's occupancy profile is generated for two adults and one child. A simulation model described in the study [64] was used to generate year-long occupancy profiles. The simulation model to generate occupancy profiles was used twice. The first iteration's profiles were applied to the bathroom, bedroom, main bedroom, kitchen, and living room. The second iteration's profiles generated for the bathroom and living room were applied to the toilet and office since the model did not support these rooms during the first iteration. This results in the maximum occupancy of the building being five persons, which can be realistic when guests are considered. Occupancy profiles for the utility room, technical room, hall, and vestibule are not generated since it is expected that residents do not stay for long in these rooms. Therefore, the metabolic equivalent of task (MET) of 1.2 is selected for the building model. The heating of each room is achieved by wall-mounted radiators with a total heating power of 9.65 kW, meaning that the ventilation system is not responsible for providing heat to the rooms. 2 kW air heater is used to warm up the supply air with a heating setpoint of 18 °C if the heat recovery capacity is insufficient. Cooling otherwise is dependent on the ventilation system since the cooling of the rooms is achieved by a cooling heat exchanger installed into the supply air duct. A more comprehensive description of this model is given in the study [65], where a neural network-based building's thermal model was generated. 3.2 Boundary conditions Boundary conditions are essential parameters that ensure sufficient IAQ in the building and residents' comfort. These conditions must be followed when regulations are conducted. The residents can define boundary conditions or select according to the standard EN 16798\u20131:2019 indoor climate category II, which states limiting values for IAQ parameters for normal conditions (Table 2 ). CO2 concentration, temperature, and relative humidity are selected from the standard as the main IAQ parameters. The standard value for CO2 concentration for living rooms is 800 ppm, and for bedrooms 550 ppm above ambient concentration. There is no lower limit value for CO2 concentration, but the concentration cannot be lower than ambient, which in the simulation is assigned to be 400 ppm [66]. Temperature and relative humidity otherwise must be within set limits. 3.3 Simulation dataset The simulation dataset is generated using a building model constructed in IDA ICE. Each occupied room has an IAQ sensor that measures the room's average CO2 concentration, temperature, and relative humidity. The AHU sensors are placed in the supply and return air duct (Fig. 5 ). The supply air temperature, relative humidity, and airflow rate are measured. Since ambient CO2 concentration in the simulation does not change, measuring it is unnecessary. CO2 concentration, temperature, and relative humidity are measured in the return air duct. All the measured data is logged into the file imported to MATLAB. The simulation dataset is divided into two: training and validation. The training data is collected for the first ten weeks starting from the beginning. This data trains forecasting models, performs boundary condition correction, and initializes forecasting models. The validation dataset includes the rest of the 42 weeks. Data from two types of ventilation systems were collected: constant air volume (CAV) and variable air volume (VAV). CAV system operates throughout the day at its nominal level, while the VAV type of system is controlled based on the CO2 concentration in the return air. In addition, proportional control was applied for the VAV type of system described in the Trane engineers newsletter [67]. To generate activations year 2022, balancing energy price and mFRR activations are used. Nord Pool Spot day ahead prices for Estonia, including 20% value-added tax (VAT), were used to calculate electricity prices during normal operating conditions when the ventilation system operated without regulations. To the day-ahead prices, additional fees were added, such as a fixed tariff grid fee of 86.5 \u20ac/MWh, renewable energy fee of 13.56 \u20ac/MWh, and electricity excise duty of 1.2 \u20ac/MWh. During up-regulation, the energy left unconsumed was multiplied by the total electricity price and subtracted from the total cost of consumed energy during the simulation period. In total, 314 up-regulations for the CAV type of system were conducted; the same value for the VAV type was 230 (Table 3 ). There were zero down regulations since the capacity for this was insufficient, and the price for regulation was not suitable. The most restricting IAQ parameter was CO2 concentration, which reached the limit in around 74% of the cases. In comparison, the temperature limit reached 16% to 19% of cases. Relative humidity had no restrictive effect on regulations with the applied simulation setup. 4 Results The flexibility management methods were applied to the collected dataset. It included training the models and calculating the power consumption and FVR duration forecasts. Forecasted values were compared with measured values to analyze residuals and evaluate the methods' accuracy. 4.1 Power consumption forecast Power consumption was forecasted using the ARMA(0, 5) model for both system types. ARMA model terms were calculated by using the AIC method. The forecast horizon was selected to be 24 h. Previous days' measurement data was used to forecast the next day's power consumption. One day was divided into 5-minute timeslots where previous days' data forecasted the next 24-hour timeslot value. Dividing data into timeslots allows for quickly respond to ventilation system startups and shutdowns. The 24th-hour forecast with the highest uncertainty was compared with the measured data to calculate the method's accuracy. The year average root means squared error (RMSE) was around 1.3 W for the CAV and 10 W for the VAV. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) was around 0.8% for the CAV and around 6.5% for the VAV. Since stochastic occupancy data was used, the VAV system power consumption was more difficult to forecast accurately. Fig. 6 is an example of measured and forecasted power consumption during the first week of November. 4.2 Pollutant generation and FVR duration Pollutant generation estimation is crucial for FVR duration estimation, and the same is for boundary conditions. If all the IAQ sensors are placed in the AHU, boundary condition correction must be done beforehand. Fig. 7 shows the boundary condition correction based on the data gathered from the second week of January. The boundary conditions were corrected based on one-week data where the 5-minute average was taken for each timestep in a day. Boundary condition correction depended on the room usage and how evenly the pollutant concentration was distributed between rooms. There are minor differences between the boundary conditions of the two ventilation system types. Simulation results show that CO2 concentration had the highest impact on flexibility. Fig. 8 shows an example of a one-week CAV type of ventilation system FVR duration estimations for the first week of November, where the FVR duration was dictated mainly by CO2 concentration. In contrast, the temperature has less impact on FVR duration. The parameter with the shortest FVR duration dictates the whole system duration. VAV type of ventilation system FVR durations (Fig. 9 ) are similar to CAV since the occupancy profile is the same. However, FVR durations are slightly lower, meaning demand-controlled ventilation lowers the available flexibility. Two approaches were conducted for each system type: room-based and AHU-based estimations. Room-based estimations considered IAQ sensors in each room and used the shortest FVR duration room. AHU-based estimations considered only sensors in one location in the AHU and implemented corrected boundary conditions. AHU-based estimations give a similar FVR duration profile as room-based estimations but have significant deviations that can be caused by stochastic occupancy and the generated boundary conditions. In residual analysis, regulations were used where CO2 concentration and temperature limit were reached (Fig. 10 ). Also, regulations, where the limit was reached within 5 min after the regulation could is conducted were excluded since the simulation timestep is 5 min. The most accurate approach to estimate FVR duration was the room-based approach. Where CO2 concentration-based estimations RMSE is around 13 min for CAV and 10 min for VAV, temperature-based FVR duration estimation RMSE is around 20 min for the CAV system and around 13 min for VAV. Room-based estimation residuals were biased to the positive side, giving more conservative values. It was the cause of using the FVR duration adjustment algorithm, which decreases given timestep estimation according to the future forecasted values. AHU-based FVR duration estimations were less accurate than the room-based approach. CO2 concentration-based estimations RMSE was around 33 min for the CAV system and 24 min for VAV. Temperature-based estimation RMSE was around 26 min for the CAV system and 19 min for VAV. 4.3 Flexibility service activations and pricing Each hour's price for the flexibility service was calculated based on the CO2 concentration measurements and costs. For example, upwards regulations are shown in Fig. 11 , where the tendered price was calculated using equation (14), where comfort cost was derived from the last two weeks' maximum balancing energy price. The last two weeks' maximum CO2 generation rate was also used in calculations. Activation of the reserve was only conducted if the tendered price was lower than the balance energy market price, there was mFRR activation, and the available capacity for the regulation was more than 10 W. VAV type of system activated energy was lower than CAV since this system is demand-controlled that causes lower power consumption. 4.4 Discussion According to the Estonian transmission system operator (TSO), Elering AS [68] up to ± 10% steady-state error is allowed for the mFRR capacity or 0,1 MW, whichever is larger. Therefore, 0.8% MAPE for the CAV system power and 6.5% MAPE for the VAV power consumption forecasting is sufficient. Furthermore, considering the minimum capacity of 1 MW, this error can be compensated by aggregating multiple ventilation systems where the effect of leveling-off forecasting errors can be achieved [69]. To estimate FVR duration, the room-based approach is the most accurate, where CO2 concentration-based RMSE for the CAV system is around 13 min and for the VAV type of system around 10 min. Considering the simulation timestep of 5 min, the resolution to calculate residual can, at maximum, be 5 min. Therefore, mass balance-based FVR estimations are usable in flexibility service. Moreover, residuals of FVR estimations are positive, which means that the IAQ during activations is less likely to be jeopardized. AHU-based estimations are less accurate but can have acceptable performance depending on the building layout and type. It can be backed by the fact that the selected building had stochastic usage, whereas nine-to-five office buildings can have this more consistent throughout a day or week. Also, demand-based ventilation and fewer fluctuations in pollutant concentration can increase the accuracy, as seen from the VAV type of system. The price to activate the available capacity is the third important parameter tested according to the Estonian balance energy market price and mFRR activations during 2022. The ventilation system operates all day in residential buildings, so regulations have little effect on the total energy consumption. During the simulation period, the total energy consumption of fans was reduced by 1.1% for the CAV system, and VAV type of system, only a 0.7% reduction was noticed (Table 4 ). The cost of energy was reduced by 4% for the CAV type of system, and around 2.2% reduction was achieved for the VAV type of system. These percentages can be increased when higher profit margins are selected, and the ventilation system is exploited more for the flexibility service. Also, in the energy calculations, air heaters and cooling systems were left out since this paper focuses on fans. It can be expected that with the desynchronization of the Baltic states from the IPS/UPS frequency area [70], the flexibility service will have more use, and there will be more activations. 5 Conclusions This paper provides a complete set of novel methods to quantify ventilation system energy flexibility developed from an aggregator's viewpoint. Developed methods open the possibility of integrating new and existing buildings with ventilation systems in a flexibility service. In contrast to existing methods and assumptions in the relevant literature, the proposed flexibility management methods employ robust and universal physical rules that are easier for aggregators and building owners to comprehend. Compared to machine learning approaches, the proposed methods require less training, and their performance does not rely on hyperparameters. The methods were tested on the example building model constructed in the IDA ICE simulation platform. A ventilation system's flexibility is quantified through capacity, FVR duration, and the tendered price for the service. ARMA model was used to forecast power consumption for CAV and VAV systems. A forecasting error of 0.8% for the CAV type of system and 6.5% for the VAV type of system was observed. Two cases to measure IAQ and calculate FVR duration were discussed. In the first case, IAQ is only measured inside AHU, where boundary condition correction was implemented. The second case discussed the possibility of installing sensors in each room which achieved more accurate duration estimations. If exceeding IAQ limits during some regulations is not an issue, installing sensors only in AHU can lower initial investment costs and accelerate the integration process. The proposed methods were tested, and results were analyzed in multiple stages. First, initial data was generated in IDA ICE which was imported to MATLAB to quantify the flexibility and generated regulation activations by altering the AHU operation schedule. Then, the simulation was rerun in IDA ICE with regulations, and acquired data was used to compare with estimated values. From the financial aspect, the cost of energy consumed was decreased by 4% for the CAV type of system and 1.1% for the VAV type of system. The profitability and optimizing parameters in the price model are subjects for further study.

        "dc:description": "Increasing use of volatile renewable energy sources causes challenges in balancing supply and demand. Therefore, demand-side flexibility has rising importance for system operators and balancing authorities. Flexibility management methods are needed to integrate loads like ventilation systems of different buildings (e.g., residential and commercial) into flexibility service. However, the available methods described in research papers require further development for implementation in practice. Heating and cooling systems have received much attention from researchers, but the potential of ventilation systems has been left out of focus. Therefore, this paper provides a complete set of novel flexibility management methods for ventilation systems created from an aggregator's viewpoint. The flexibility is quantified through capacity (e.i. the amount of power consumption that can be altered), forced ventilation rate duration, and the tendered price for the service. The proposed methods were tested on a building model constructed and simulated in IDA ICE. The data processing and flexibility management methods were applied in MATLAB. Two types of ventilation systems with different sensor configurations were considered: constant and variable air volume. Forced ventilation rate duration is calculated using energy and mass balance analysis where the root means squared error was 10 to 33 min, depending on the system type, measured parameter, and sensor location. The flexibility service pricing model was tested on the 2022 years' manual frequency restoration reserve (mFRR) activation and balance energy market data.",
