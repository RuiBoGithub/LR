The first chart shows the weekly heating energy consumption, the second one shows the ratio compared with the healthy case. A small reduction in heat exchanger efficiency causes an increase in heating of around 2% in the coldest periods. A larger reduction, on the other hand, causes an increase of over 8%. Fig. 3 Fig. 4 Heating energy consumption over the entire winter season in experiments A and B. In experiment A, the total energy consumed is just below 1% higher compared to the healthy conditions. In experiment B, the total energy consumed is about 4% higher compared to the healthy conditions. Fig. 4 Fig. 5 Post-HX temperature in experiments A and B. In the first chart, the daily average temperature is visibly lower than the setpoint in experiment A, and even more in experiment B. In the second chart, the temperature falls significantly below the setpoint at the beginning of the day, but often it recovers later. Fig. 5 Fig. 6 Daily average supply temperature in experiment C. The reduced water loop temperature does not have a visible effect on the air temperature. Fig. 6 Fig. 7 Fan energy consumption in experiments D and E. After the fault happens, energy consumption visibly increases over time. Fig. 7 Fig. 8 Fan efficiency in experiments D and E, computed as daily airflow divided by daily energy consumption. After the faults happen, fan efficiency decreases constantly over time. The visible decrease in efficiency right before the fault is an artifact due to weekly aggregation.

Campusvej 55, DK-5230, Odense M, Denmark. Campusvej 55 Odense M DK-5230 Denmark Buildings systems are one of the world's largest energy consumer, and their faults often cause energy waste and occupants discomfort. In this paper, we propose a model-based method for fault detection and diagnostics of ventilation units supported by a set of rules. Under-performing subsystems are first isolated by comparing the expected energy consumption obtained through a dynamic energy model, then the faulty component is diagnosed using a set of rules. The method is tested on the EnergyPlus model of an existing building. Two types of faults are introduced by changing model's parameters: abrupt faults, and gradual faults, where parameters change gradually over time. The faults causing significant increase in consumption are correctly identified by the proposed method. Moreover, an assessment of the impact of the faults is reported, showing up to 8% increase in the ventilation unit energy consumption. Finally, detection of gradual faults has promising applications in faults prediction. Keywords Building performance Fault detection and diagnostics Dynamic building models Ventilation systems Rule-based fault detection 1 Introduction Buildings are one of the world's largest energy consumer. In Europe, they account for 40% of the total consumed energy and a large part of CO 2 emissions [1]. In the United States of America, they are responsible for over 41%, more than industry and transportation, and energy consumption has been steadily increasing, doubling from 1290 TWh in 1980 to 2784 TWh in 2010 [2]. Thus, buildings are an important actor with respect to the long-term environmental goals such as Europe 20 20 [3] and its proposed extensions [4], or doubling the U. S. A. energy productivity by 2050 [5]. In the latest years, several standards and references have been developed to assess and certify the energy efficiency in buildings, such as ENERGY Star [6] and LEED [7], in order to inform final users about the energy performance of buildings. However, such certifications often give an incorrect measure of the actual energy efficiency, overestimating it compared to the actual one. Therefore, it exists an energy performance gap between the design goals and certifications, and the actual building [8\u201311]. This gap is caused by several factors, both at the design stage, such as inaccuracies in building modelling, and at operational stage, such as inefficient building control strategies or system malfunctions. A building consuming more energy than expected causes a positive gap, but a negative gap can also be undesired, e.g. when it corresponds to lower occupants\u2019 comfort level. Calì et al. investigated the energy performance gap in German dwellings built at the end of the 1950s. A holistic energy retrofit was implemented in the considered buildings and the performance was monitored and reported. Comparing the actual and the promised energy savings from the buildings after retrofit, a large energy performance gap of 287% was highlighted. Major factors contributing to this gap were identified including occupants\u2019 behaviour, poor systems installation and components malfunctioning [12]. Modern buildings contain several subsystems, such as lighting, heating, ventilation and air-conditioning, sensing networks and booking systems, usually coordinated by a central building management system (BMS). Each of these systems can have considerable complexity and, therefore, are more vulnerable to faults. Faults can cause reduced occupants comfort, e.g. a broken thermostat would result in too high or too low temperature in a room, but also increased energy consumption, e.g. simultaneous heating and cooling. Energy waste due to faults can be massive, and it significantly impacts the energy performance gap. In 2009, 13 of the most common faults in non-residential buildings in the U. S. A. were estimated to cause over 3.3 billion $ [13], and this number was supported by other recent reports [14]. Recently, fault detection and diagnostics (FDD) techniques have been studied and applied in the context of building systems. Such techniques have been successfully developed and deployed for decades in several fields, such as avionics and process control. FDD aims for quick and complete identification of faults present in building systems, in order to minimize occupants discomfort and energy waste. In this paper, we propose a model-based method for FDD in building HVAC systems, supported by a set of rules. Variations in consumed energy are monitored to isolate anomalous components, and a set of rules is further used to validate their operations. We use the dynamic energy model of a real building to simulate faults and test our method, and we report the results. We consider faults affecting heaters, HXs and fans. The work was carried out within project COORDICY, a strategic Danish American interdisciplinary research project for advancing buildings intelligence. The rest of the paper is organized as it follows. In section 2, a general review of the current state of the art is presented. The method and the evaluation methodology are presented in section 3. A case study is introduced in Section 4, and specific experiments are defined in section 5. Results from the experiments are reported in section 6. Finally, conclusions are drawn in section 7. 2 State of the art A comprehensive review of FDD methods for building system was presented by Kim and Katipamula in 2018 [15]. The authors categorize FDD methods in three large groups: history-based methods, quantitative model-based methods and qualitative model-based methods. In history-based methods, a black box model of the system under test is created from historical data and used to validate and predict the behaviour of the system itself. Several techniques can be used for the model, such as, linear and non-linear regression, principal components analysis (PCA), artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machines (SVM) and statistical methods. Methods in this category usually consist of two separate phases: an offline training phase, and an online testing phase. During the training phase, historical data is fed to the model, so that its hidden parameters are estimated. This phase usually occurs only once, or very rarely, only when the system significantly changes structure, and can take considerably long time. The result is a model that predicts or validates the system's behaviour. During the testing phase, real-time data from the system is fed as input to the model, and its outputs are compared with actual measurements from the system. If no faults are present, the model is assumed to accurately characterize the system. If, on the other hand, the system is affected by a fault, its behaviour is assumed to be different. Therefore, faults are detected when the model does not follow the proper operation of the system. The typical approach for diagnosing faults is to train multiple models, using historical data from systems affected by each fault. During the testing phase, the system's behaviour is compared with each of the resulting models, and the matching one corresponds to the specific fault, or no fault. If no model matches the current behaviour, an unknown fault might be present. History-based method do not use any specific information about the system under test, the model is constructed entirely from data. For this reason, such methods are easily portable to different systems, as long as training data is available. An example of history-based method was proposed by Li and Wen [16]. The authors present a hybrid method based on PCA and pattern matching for FDD in air handling units (AHUs). Periods in historical data where conditions are similar to the current ones in the system are identified through pattern matching. If the system status is different from the one in those periods, an alarm is raised. The authors test their method on experimental data containing six different faults. The main disadvantage of history-based methods is the requirement of fault-free historical data. A model trained with unknown faulty historical data does not represent the correct behaviour, and will wrongly flag faults as correct operation. This requirement makes it impossible to deploy history-based methods on newly installed systems, for which historical data has not been collected yet. Moreover, labelled faulty historical data, necessary to perform fault diagnostics, is very rarely available. In quantitative model-based methods, a model of the system under test is constructed from first principles and, as in history-based methods, is used to validate and predict the behaviour of the system itself. The main difference from history-based methods is the way the model is constructed. While, in history-based methods, the model was trained using data, in quantitative model-based methods, it is manually constructed by field experts using detailed knowledge of the system. Quantitative models often consists of a set of differential equations modelling the physical relationships of different quantities in the system, and include informations about materials, geometry and specific components. Quantitative models are usually much more accurate than black box models. They can also be used to detect and diagnose faults without requiring labelled faulty historical data, and sometimes they are even able to detect unknown faults. Depending on the required accuracy, quantitative models can have large complexity, and it can take extensive work from several field experts to build a model. Complexity also affects the runtime of such models, while history-based methods can validate data in real-time, for quantitative models, this can take several minutes. Moreover, such models are tailored to a specific system, and they are difficult to adapt to different ones. Finally, sometimes models are too complex to explicitly provide values for all their parameters, and historical data is necessary for parameter estimation. An example of a quantitative model-based method was proposed by Boracchi et al. [17]. The authors present a hierarchical framework for FDD with respect to contaminants across ventilation systems. The first two layers are used to detect local changes in contaminants concentration, and to ensure that such changes have statistical significance. The top layer analyzes the building's layout and determines whether changes are due to actual contaminants or sensors faults, under the assumption that they would propagate through the building in different ways. The proposed method is tested on several artificially generated datasets. In qualitative model-based methods, the behaviour of the system is encoded as a set of qualitative relationships. The most common approach is to build a set of rules describing the system's correct operation, and use them to validate the current behaviour. The main advantage of rule-based methods is their simplicity. Rules are defined by field experts without requiring historical data or detailed knowledge of the system's physics. Set of rules are usually simple enough that can be understood and manually validated. Moreover, rules can often be obtained directly from system documentation without any manual intervention. Set of rules, however, can only represent relatively simple system dynamics. For complex systems, a long list of narrow, non-overlapping rules is necessary. A long list of rules, moreover, is difficult to maintain and to validate. E.g. it becomes likely to add a rule which is inconsistent or contradictory with the rest. Nevertheless, rule-based systems are effective in representing and validating high-level, expected behaviour of the system. E.g. a simple rule stating that empty rooms have no lighting can detect a broken occupancy sensor. Another example could be a rule stating that temperature must be within setpoints. In case the rule is not satisfied, a fault in the heating and cooling system is present. In fact, many commercial BMSs offer rudimentary FDD using simple alarms. A recent example of rule-based method was proposed by Deshmukh et al. [18]. The authors define a set of rules for detecting simultaneous heating and cooling in a building. Two decision trees are defined, one for winter and one for summer, due to different dynamics and behaviours in the two seasons. The method is tested on a dataset from a real academic building. Moreover, the authors assess the impact of simultaneous heating and cooling over a single month in 400 MWh, which corresponds to a financial loss of more than 24000$. 2.1 Faults simulation According to Shi and O'Brien [19], modern FDD methods, while providing useful information about existing faults to building maintenance, often lack an assessment of such faults' impact on the overall building energy performance. The authors propose a methodology for faults impact evaluation based on comparing faulty conditions with a baseline, obtained from healthy conditions. They identify three challenges: identifying symptoms caused by faults, quantifying the severity of such symptoms, and mapping them to simulation inputs and outputs. They test their methodology on a model of a real building, simulating four different faults: low hot water supply temperature, low AHU supply fan efficiency, increased infiltration rate due to window leakage and stuck closed reheat valve inside a variable air volume (vav) terminal. A study using EnergyPlus to simulate HVAC faults was presented by Basarkar et al. [20]. Four faults were considered: clogging of pipes in the plant loop, fouling of water heating coils, leaking outside air economizer dampers and zone temperature sensor offset. In the first case, a model of the system curve in both healthy and faulty conditions is developed. The authors consider different approaches for faults simulation. EnergyPlus supports an internal scripting engine, however, it is complex and requires reimplementing control logic. Reusable fault model objects, on the other hand, remove that requirement. Finally, the authors test their method on a model of a real building, assessing the energy impact of the four faults. The custom implementation for faults simulation in EnergyPlus was presented in details by Zhang and Hong, applied to HVAC systems [21]. The authors argue that most of the current research focus on impact at component or subsystem level, and do not assess impact at the whole building level, and, therefore, propose to use EnergyPlus as a whole building simulation engine. The authors define three approaches for faults simulation in EnergyPlus. \u2022 Modifying parameters directly in the model file. This is the simplest approach, however, only a limited number of parameters are exposed, and it cannot be used for simulating faults which result in complex dynamics. \u2022 Using the internal scripting engine. This allows, but also requires, to define complex interactions between the individual components, and it requires extensive knowledge of the system. \u2022 Using native fault objects. With this approach, users can define complex dynamics within the system, however, internal interactions are handled by the engine itself. Moreover, faults objects are often generic and reusable across different buildings. The main drawback is that only a limited number of fault objects are available. The authors consider four faults objects implemented in EnergyPlus: sensor faults with air economizers, thermostat/humidistat offset, heating and cooling coil fouling, and dirty air filters. The impact on the whole building energy consumption of these faults is assessed on the model of an ideal building. Other engines has been successfully used for faults simulation. A model of a room-level ventilation system was developed using Simulink by Behravan et al., which was used to perform FDD using acyclic graphs [22]. Modelica simulation software was used to extend the building information model (BIM) by Andriamamonjy et al., who also presented a FDD framework for AHUs [23]. 2.2 Contributions FDD for HVAC systems is a popular research field, however, most publications focus on components such as chillers, refrigerators and heating coils, while heat exchangers are often ignored. Moreover, while faults simulation has been successfully used in literature for assessing impact of faults, the impact is rarely reported at whole building level. The main contribution of this paper is, therefore, two-fold. At first, we present a model-based method for non-simultaneous FDD on HVAC systems, supported by a set of rules. We use a detailed whole building dynamic energy model, calibrated using actual data, to isolate under-performing subsystems, and a set of rules to verify the correct operation of individual components. In particular, we consider components such as heat exchangers, hot water heating loops and fans, and we modify parameters in the model to simulate different faults. Afterwards, we present an assessment of the impact of selected faults on the energy consumption of a real case-study building. 3 Method In this paper, we propose a hybrid quantitative model-based method for FDD in ventilation units, supported by a set of rules. The overview, shown in Fig. 1 , is the following. A simulation of the building in healthy conditions is performed to obtain the expected energy consumption. Under-performing subsystems are identified by monitoring the building's energy distribution tree, as presented in our previous work [24]. Afterwards, a set of rules is defined to identify specific faults, indicated in the figure by the clauses A , B , \u2026 I . 3.1 Evaluation In order to test and validate a FDD method, it must be deployed on a known faulty system. We simulate the operation of a real building using its dynamic energy model, developed using the EnergyPlus simulation engine [25]. The models exposes several parameters corresponding to characteristics of many buildings equipment. E.g. operational schedules, building materials, airflow constraints, components efficiency and operational temperature, CO 2 and pressure setpoints. Normally, values for these parameters are selected to match the real building, either manually or using some parameter estimation method. However, they can also be modified to represent faulty components. E.g. the air infiltration rate can be modified in order to simulate an increased thermal loss caused by a leak. Airflow constraints can be changed to simulate oversized or undersized equipment. Components efficiency can be decreased to simulate wearing and damages. In this paper, we design a set of experiments to evaluate the presented FDD method. In each experiment, we select a fault and we simulate it by modifying the corresponding parameters. The output from the simulation represent the behaviour of the entire building when affected by the fault, not only the single component. Finally, we apply the presented method to the resulting data. 4 Case study: building OU44 In this paper, we introduce building Odense undervisning 44 (OU44) as case study. The building, located at the Campus Odense of the University of Southern Denmark, has been used as living lab for several studies and experiments. The building is mainly used for teaching and office work, and it contains about 200 rooms, divided among classrooms, offices, and other room types, layered in three floors. Four ventilation units provide air supply to the building, one for each corner (north-east, north-west, south-east, south-west). In order to provide an accurate prediction of healthy behaviour as well as to estimate accurately the impact of different faults, a detailed whole building energy performance model of the considered building is used [26]. The dynamic energy model, built in EnergyPlus, was calibrated considering the daily energy consumption data of the building sub-systems, including lighting, heating, ventilation and photovoltaic systems. For carrying out the calibration, specific parameters are highlighted as infiltration rates, fan pressure rise, insulation thickness, loads and schedules. The calibration starts with initial parameter values considered based on the building design numbers, and a margin of variation of ± 20% is set to eliminate any outliers in the chosen optimal scenario. It shall be mentioned that the calibrated model was validated by the authors considering actual daily building operation data. A diagram of a ventilation unit is shown in Fig. 2 . Inlet air enters from the bottom left, goes through a heat exchanger, which is used for preheating using exhaust air. Preheated air, if still colder than the desired setpoint, is further heated using a hot water based heating loop, and pushed to the main shaft, from which it will reach individual rooms. On the way out, air exits the rooms through the extract shaft, goes through the heat exchanger, and it finally leaves the building. In the model, one fan is used for pushing air through the unit pipes. In the real building, one additional fan is located on the exhaust pipe, before air exists the building. A ventilation unit contains several components, and each of them can be affected by faults. Few experiments were defined and performed, in order to evaluate the impact of faults on the final energy consumption, and also to test the FDD method previously defined. 5 Experiments In total, five experiments (A, B, C, D and E) were defined in order to conduct simulation of different faults in a ventilation unit. The experiments were divided in two groups: one for abrupt faults and one for gradual faults. In abrupt faults experiments, two simulations were performed over the same period, one with original parameters values, and one with faulty parameters values. In gradual faults experiments, one simulation was performed over the entire period using original parameters values, and several consecutive simulations were performed by gradually changing the parameters values. In abrupt faults experiments, faults in air temperature loop\u2014i.e. heat exchanger and heater\u2014were simulated. Each experiment was duplicated in both summer and winter, in order to account for difference in heating between warm and cold periods. In gradual faults experiments, on the other hand, faults were simulated in the air supply systems. Since air supply does not have a strong dependence on outdoor temperature, only one experiment was performed. Moreover, gradual faults required a longer simulation period, which span several months during both winter and summer. 5.1 Abrupt faults in air temperature loop The heat exchanger and the heater do not consume a significant amount of electrical energy, i.e. turning them on or off cannot be observed in the electricity meters, where they are dwarfed by the fans\u2019 electrical consumption. Instead, a faulty heat exchanger will result in increased heating, which could have a quantifiable effect on the heat meter. A faulty heater might also affect the heat meter, however, it should mainly affect the supply air temperature. Two faults were considered in these experiments. \u2022 Reduced efficiency of heat exchanger, experiments A and B. \u2022 Reduced heater effect, experiment C. Since heating depends strongly on outdoor temperature, the dynamics of the heating system differ significantly during winter and summer seasons. In order to cover both cases, every experiment is performed twice, once during winter and once during summer. 5.2 Gradual faults in air supply systems Fans are responsible for the largest share of electrical consumption in the ventilation unit. Two faults were considered in these experiments. \u2022 Reduced fan efficiency (gradual, due to wearing), experiment D. \u2022 Obstruct ducts (gradual, due to, e.g. filters accumulating dust), experiment E. In experiment E, there are two different outcomes. \u2022 The requested airflow is low enough that the fan can achieve it despite the ducts being obstructed. This situation should be indistinguishable from reduced efficiency. \u2022 The requested airflow is above the fan capacity (due to obstruction). 5.3 Rules The following rules are defined to detect the faults introduced in the experiments. If the energy consumed for heating the air is higher than the expected value, either the post-HX temperature is lower than expected, too, or the heater is not operating correctly. This behaviour is encoded in rule 1. Rule 1: Heater energy rule. Image 1 If post-HX temperature is lower than the expected setpoint, the heat exchanger is not recovering enough heat from extract air. The heat exchanger efficiency is lower than expected and, therefore, the component is faulty. This behaviour is encoded in rule 2. Rule 2: Post-HX air temperature rule. Image 2 Regardless of action of heat exchanger and heating energy consumption, supply air temperature must be above setpoint. If this constraint is not satisfied, the heater is not operating correctly. This behaviour is encoded in rule 3. Rule 3: Supply air temperature rule. Image 3 If fan energy is higher than expected, either the fan is wearing and its efficiency is decreasing, or ducts are obstructed. If, at the same time, provided airflow is lower than expected, ducts are obstructed. This behaviour is encoded in rule 4. Rule 4: Fan energy rule. Image 4 5.4 Experiments parameters 5.4.1 Experiments A and B In these experiments, the heat exchanger efficiency is reduced by list 20% and 50% from its proper operation calibrated value, in order to simulate wearing. In both cases, two separate instances were simulated, one for warm months and one for cold months. In the former, the experiment runs from 2016-05-01 to 2016-07-31. In the latter, the experiment runs from 2016-10-01 to 2016-12-31. Table 1 shows the parameters\u2019 values in the EnergyPlus model. 5.4.2 Experiment C In this experiment, hot water temperature in the heating loop is reduced by 3 K from its proper operation calibrated value, in order to simulate a reduced heater effect. This experiment was divided in two instances, one for warm months and one for cold months. In the former, the experiment runs from 2016-05-01 to 2016-07-31. In the latter, the experiment runs from 2016-10-01 to 2016-12-31. Table 2 shows the parameters\u2019 values in the EnergyPlus model. 5.4.3 Experiment D In this experiment, fan efficiency is gradually reduced over time from its proper operation calibrated value, in order to simulate wearing. The experiment runs from 2016-01-01 to 2016-07-31. A fault is simulated on 2016-03-01, at which point the fan efficiency decreases from its initial value of 0.8 by 2.5% every week. The relevant parameter in the EnergyPlus model is Fan Total Efficiency, and its values are shown in Table 3 . 5.4.4 Experiment E In this experiment, fan pressure rise is gradually increased over time from its proper operation calibrated value, in order to simulate obstructed ducts due to dust and other material. The experiment runs from 2016-01-01 to 2016-07-31. A fault is simulated on 2016-03-01, at which point the fan pressure rise increases from its initial value of 560 kPa by 2.5% every week. The relevant parameter in the EnergyPlus model is Pressure Rise, and its values are shown in Table 4 . 6 Results In experiments A and B, the efficiency of the heat exchanger were decreased by list 20% and 50%. The effect of heat exchanger is to heat up inlet air using extract air, in order to reduce the necessary energy from the heater. During warm months, no visible effect was present, neither in energy consumption, or in temperatures across the ventilation unit. During cold months, on the other hand, post-HX temperature was lower, and energy consumption increased. The weekly energy consumption for heating is shown in Fig. 3 for the two experiments, together with the one in the healthy case. In experiment A, the energy consumption increases over time compared with the healthy one, reaching about 2% higher in the coldest weeks. In experiment B, on the other hand, the increase is steeper and faster. The energy consumption is over 4% higher than expected already at the beginning of the cold season, and it reaches over 8% during the coldest weeks. In Fig. 4 , the total energy consumption over the entire winter season in healthy conditions and in experiments A and B is shown. The effect of the worst performing weeks in both experiments are diluted over the whole period, but the increase in energy consumption is still significant at about 1% and 4% in experiments A and B, respectively. The first chart in Fig. 5 shows the daily average post-HX temperature for the two experiments against the one in the healthy case. In the healthy case, temperature is always above setpoint, i.e. the heat exchanger is able to preheat inlet air. In both experiments A and B, on the other hand, the post-HX temperature is frequently lower than the setpoint, especially during the coldest weeks. In experiment A, where the efficiency was reduced by 20%, post-HX temperature can fall 1 K below the setpoint. In experiment B, where the efficiency was reduced by a more drastic 50%, the temperature consistently falls over 2 K below the setpoint. In the second chart in Fig. 5, the point-wise values of post-HX temperature are shown during one of the coldest weeks in the simulation period. Post-HX temperature falls below the setpoint at the beginning of the day, however, it also rises during the day. This is due to increase in outdoor temperature and indoor temperature, which, in turns, increases the effect of the heat exchanger. While the daily average captures the overall trend, the point-wise plot shows that the temperature falls over 2 K below the setpoint for long time during the day in experiment A. In experiment B, where the efficiency was significantly reduced, the temperature falls over 4 K below the setpoint. The low spike at the beginning of the week is due to the heating system being turned off during the weekend. In experiment C, the inlet and outlet water temperatures in the hot water loop were decreased by 3 K. The heater is used to heat up air when the effect of the heat exchanger is not enough to reach the setpoint. No significant increase in energy consumption was visible, neither during warm months, or during cold months. The charts in Fig. 6 shows the daily average supply temperature for the experiment, against the one in the healthy case during cold months, and the point-wise temperature for one of the coldest weeks. Besides some irregular behaviour on Monday, there is no visible difference. Therefore, the decrease in hot water loop temperature does not affect the heating system. In experiment D, the efficiency of the fan in the ventilation unit was decreased by 2.5% every week, starting on 2016-03-01. In experiment E, the pressure rise across the fan was similarly increased by 2.5% every week. Fig. 7 shows the energy consumed by the fan in the two experiments against the one in the healthy case. In the healthy case, the fan energy consumption is roughly constant over time. In both experiments, on the other hand, the consumed energy visibly increases over time after the fault happened. Fig. 8 shows the efficiency of the fan in the two experiments, computed as daily airflow divided by daily energy consumption (measured as m3 /s over KW/h), and aggregated by week, against the one in the healthy case. Airflows in experiments D and E coincide and, therefore, it was not possible to distinguish the case of reduced fan efficiency from the case of duct obstruction. 6.1 Impact of faults In experiments A and B, the heating energy consumption increased by up to list 2% and 8% compared with the one in healthy conditions. In the coldest weeks, heating energy consumption can reach 2000 KWh. Additional heating due to decreased heat exchanger efficiency would be responsible for40 kWh and 160 kWh. In experiments D and E, at the end of the simulation, the weekly fan electrical energy consumption was 464 kWh higher than the one in the healthy conditions. The energy waste caused by the faults simulated in the experiment appears to be relatively small. However, this is due to the high energy efficiency of building OU44. The building is, as a matter of fact, classified as a 2020 class building, according to the Danish Building Regulations [28]. This class includes buildings whose annual primary energy consumption must not exceed 25 kW h/m2, and was defined in the context of long-term energy savings goals. Therefore, the impact of faults on energy consumption, while significant in relative terms, is small in absolute terms for highly efficient buildings. The vast majority of existing buildings, on the other hand, are significantly less energy efficiency compared to building OU44. E.g. in Europe, over 80% of the buildings were constructed before 1990, and over 40% date back to 1960 [29], where there was not the same focus on energy efficiency as there is today, and, therefore, they consume a considerably higher amount of energy. The same relative impacts, therefore, become significant also in absolute terms for many buildings. 6.2 Implications for faults prediction The method proposed in this paper shows promising implications in the context of faults prediction. One of the limitations of FDD methods is that they can only detect faults after they happen. At that point, faults might disrupt the building use, and, moreover, maintenance operations might be delayed, causing prolonged energy waste and occupants discomfort. FDD methods are, therefore, reactive, since they react to faults, quickly detecting them and identifying their cause. Faults prediction methods, on the other hand, are proactive, i.e. they aim to predict the occurrence of faults before they even manifest, usually by observing behaviour that are known to lead to malfunctioning. For this reason, they are, in general, less accurate and reliable than FDD methods. However, the information that a fault is going to happen in the near future can be extremely useful, e.g. to avoid service disruption, to schedule maintenance in advance, or to gather replacement equipment before necessary. In experiments D and E, a decreasing efficiency was observed. In a real building, efficiency might be affected by noise, e.g. due to sensor bias, and seasonal variations. Therefore, the acceptable efficiency might be lower than the usual one. A slow decrease, such as the one observed in the experiments, might be detected before it could have a significant impact on building operations. Maintenance work could then be scheduled to address the fault, e.g. by replacing a wearing component, or cleaning the ducts. 7 Conclusion In this paper, we proposed a model-based method for FDD on ventilation units, supported by a set of rules. At first, under-performing components are identified by comparing the energy consumption recorded by the energy meters with the expected one. Afterwards, a set of rules is used to precisely diagnose the faulty component. We defined five experiments, in which we used an EnergyPlus model of an existing building, calibrated with real data, to simulate its ventilation system. In each experiment, we introduced different faults, and we tested our method on those data. One of the experiments did not yield any measurable effect on the building, while the others caused a measurable increase in energy consumption, and were detected and further diagnosed by the presented method. Faults were simulated by modifying parameters in the model. This allowed to assess the impact of the faults, both in terms of occupants comfort, and in terms of energy waste. Faults were responsible for significant relative increased energy consumption, up to 8% increase for heating energy, however, their effect was modest in absolute terms. The cause was the extremely high energy efficiency of the building presented as a case study, which belongs to the highest efficiency class defined in the Danish Building Regulations. Nevertheless, the results give insights on less efficient buildings, which are much more common nowadays, where the same relative energy consumption increase would result in significant absolute amounts. Finally, the experiments involving gradual faults showed promising implications with respect to faults prediction. By detecting a decreasing term in efficiency early on, maintenance operations can be scheduled before the system reaches problematic conditions. This would reduce disruption and downtime for building operations. Further development is still necessary for achieving a complete and autonomous FDD application. E.g. proper thresholds need to be defined to automatically determine whether a measurement is too distant from the expected value. Simulating abrupt faults with gradually changing parameters can be a way to determine such thresholds. Other faults can be simulated by changing parameters in the model, or by providing custom schedules, or by employing more advanced techniques such as the ones described by Zhang and Hong [21]. This method was developed in the context of a complete framework for FDD and energy performance monitoring for buildings [26]. At first, a series of test for time-series data [30] are used to validate the sensing infrastructure, which is fundamental for any building application. Once the status of the building can be trusted, the energy distribution tree is used to identify under-performing subsystems [24]. Finally, different methods were developed to further investigate individual subsystems and diagnose the precise faulty component [31\u201333].

In this paper, we propose a model-based method for fault detection and diagnostics of ventilation units supported by a set of rules. Under-performing subsystems are first isolated by comparing the expected energy consumption obtained through a dynamic energy model, then the faulty component is diagnosed using a set of rules. The method is tested on the EnergyPlus model of an existing building. Two types of faults are introduced by changing model's parameters: abrupt faults, and gradual faults, where parameters change gradually over time. The faults causing significant increase in consumption are correctly identified by the proposed method. Moreover, an assessment of the impact of the faults is reported, showing up to 8% increase in the ventilation unit energy consumption. Finally, detection of gradual faults has promising applications in faults prediction.",
