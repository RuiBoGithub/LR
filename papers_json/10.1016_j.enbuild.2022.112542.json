The current study proposed the Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) AI control algorithm for energy-saving optimization in 1U air-cooled server mockup for different configurations and scenarios. The proposed algorithm can handle the server's complex thermal environment, including number of heat sources and their locations, type of heat sink, airflow, fan and bypass airflow. Based on the analysis and test results, it is found that controlling a single fan individually and the fans in different zones can offer the reduction of fan energy by 39\u201347% compared with the controlling all fans collectively. After the modification in observation characteristics, the fan usage rate was reduced by 45% compared with the single fan control model. Further, five different control models were developed and tested with experiments for different function variables and reward functions on three server configurations with different algorithmic settings for energy saving optimizations. The heat source of the three server configurations was close to the upper limit temperature and maintained stably by saving about 12% to 50% fan energy consumption. The algorithm can judge the system status and successfully provide real-time decision-making action thereby the energy consumption of the fan is significantly reduced.

Hundreds to thousands of servers are stacked in numerous data racks of the data center along with enormous heat dissipation that must be managed beforehand. For either online or offline platforms, servers serve as the most important equipment behind all the applicative processing on the world wide web. Processing chips inside the servers are one of the major heat sources in the data centers. Standard air cooling, liquid cooling or immersion cooling can be used to handle the gigantic heat. Yet, air cooling is still the most popular cooling means for its simplicity in implication and reliability in long term operation [1\u20133]. Hence, server cooling strategies along with effective airflow management inside data centers are must-solved for data center deployment. From individual users to enterprises, they all rely on the servers with fast, stable, and reliable functions. However, without effective cooling, overheating can incur abnormal damage to the server. Yet, the temperature of the server must be contained within a certain threshold. Of course, one can run the fan at full speed to prevent overheating. However, this strategy is not good because a significant amount of energy is wasted in the server fan. Note that the fan power is proportional to the cubic of revolution (fan law). In this regard, it is essential to regulate the fan speed in the appropriate range provided that overheating is prevented as far as energy saving is concerned. A typical 1U server consists of CPUs, RAMs, graphics processing unit (GPU), network, etc. Heat dissipations of each component range from tens to several hundred watts. For effective heat dissipation, heat sinks with fins are normally deployed on the top of the CPU and GPU in the server. Among various fin configurations on the heat sink, plate-fin is one of the most preferred in the industry practice [4\u20137]. Server fans play a vital role in removing heat from the heat sink keeping the chip temperature within the threshold. Thermal loading based on the threshold defined for the junction temperature at the server CPU/GPU alters the fan speed. Therefore, optimizing the fan frequency in the operational server to save the electricity consumption is one of the imperative aspects of the research domains. Recently, the research based on the data driven and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) modelling has been proven to be one of the best Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for datacentre AI applications [8\u201311]. However, decision making action implementation based on the unknown variable changes is still one of the biggest challenges for these models. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms have a significant role in many applications to handle complex environments such as electrical vehicles, building clusters, thermal storage and HVAC systems [12\u201316]. However, pertaining to the datacentre server cooling applications at the server level fan control, some of the research studies are summarised in Table 1 . DRL algorithm is one of the most popular AI control strategies in various applications. Optimal outcomes can be easily accessible in DRL via deep neural networks with multi-dimensional datasets. By continuous learning, the algorithm can make accurate judgments in real-time to give the most appropriate decision-making action. This action corrects the control of the cooling system, and monitors the energy consumption according to the current status quo to avoid energy waste on the cooling system. Gao and Jamidar [17] added machine learning to Google's data center by combining the features such as heat load, temperature, external air dry humidity, airflow direction and speed to output predicted Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) values in artificial neural networks. It demonstrated that neural networks can couple multiple system features so that models can be taught to find optimal results. Extension of such neural networks using deep deterministic strategy gradient (DDSG) algorithms, Mnih et al. [25] conducted in-depth research, which repeatedly trains actors and critic artificial neural networks through memory playback. A simulated data center case study using EnergyPlus was used for the evaluation of DRL strategy to reduce energy consumption by Biemann et al. [26]. Four actor-critic algorithms were tested to balance the thermal environment with respect to weather adaptability and energy efficiency. All the algorithms showed a minimum 10 % energy reduction compared with the model-based controllers. Ma and Ding [27] developed DRL based DDPG method for energy consumption of cloud computing data center. Despite providing the method via flow chart with statistical modeling support, the research was incomplete due to the absence of experimental testing datasets and lack of energy consumption parametric relations to execute this method. For a similar application of edge computing data center (ECDC) systems, Perez et al. [28] proposed DRL based energy optimization for two-phase immersion cooling and smart allocation. This research has provided modeling, simulation and optimization insights with the support of mathematical physical phenomena and datasets from the hardware prototypes for ECDC system. The proposed DRL can reduced the energy consumption by 24 % and their immersion cooling ECDC saved 22.8 % average energy in comparison to an air-cooled system. The airflow and thermal management of the server-level energy analysis were missing from this research. The temperature setpoint is a very important parameter to achieve optimal control in building applications. A similar objective was achieved by Fang et al. [29] by designing Deep Q-learning (DQN) optimal control strategy for indoor air temperature using EnergyPlus Python simulation and case study experiments. The simulation platform was used to train the DQN environment and provided the temperature setpoint control action. Energy saving tradeoff between HVAC system energy consumption and indoor air temperature was achieved. The recommendations were provided for DRL control strategies for multi zone building HVAC system. In a similar way, another recent study by Zou et al. [30] developed DRL based control using the long-short-term-memory (LSTM) framework for Air Handling Unit (AHU). Two years of building automation system data was used for training and validation of the proposed algorithm resulting in achieving 27\u201330 % energy savings in the original system. A comparison of DRL based testing for nine campus buildings with the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) strategy, Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II, Rule-Based Control (RBC) and Model Predictive Control (MPC) was provided by Qin et al. [31]. DRL strategies were shown to be the best quantitively and qualitatively using seven factors compared with the other strategies recommending the best control environment for sustainable urban development. Due to the inherent challenges of DRL implementations for a wide range of variables due to the dynamic systems, there is still a research gap that needs to be addressed [32]. Thermal management inside the server is complex and dynamic due to the variable airflow rates, heat source variation from varying computational load, heat sink design and server fan configurations. Based on the literature review for server level and other DRL applications, it is evident that DRL algorithm can provide the platform for energy optimization for dynamic systems. Very few researchers attempted server level DRL, yet, none of them provided the detailed heat transfer-based modeling environment with the real time testing scenarios. Therefore, this research study aims for optimal energy saving aspect via fan controls based on DRL AI based algorithm while avoiding the server overheating. Depth Deterministic Strategy Gradient (DDSG) algorithm based on DRL is used as the training structure in this study, and the internal state of the system is quantified for energy-saving via server fan control according to the state of each heat source temperature as shown in Fig. 1 . Considering the previous research study that only uses simulation datasets [18], the agent can maintain the upper limit temperature to reduce energy consumption, the present study further explores the impact of control methods, system characteristics and reward function feedback on the 1U server. Yet the present method removes the supplied heat from the reward function and use the maximum temperature instead. The approach is more realistic in practice because temperature is a measurable quantity while heat generation is usually unknown in typical server system. In addition, optimization of fan energy consumption using experimental datasets is studied through the adjustment of the above three methods (impact of control methods, system characteristics and reward function feedback) to control system temperature. The experimental validation by real time fan control using this strategy is the uniqueness of the current research. The algorithm environmental system consists of an air-cooled server mockup. It is a closed loop forced convection air cooling system, coupled with the various internal component location. Therefore, the actual airflow inside the server may bypass the heat sink substantially. Hence, the estimation of thermal performance must be considered by different degrees of bypass effect. An empirical relation by Jonsson et al. [33] was used to predict the airflow and thermal aspect by pressure drop and the Nusselt number. This paper is organized by providing the details of DDSG based DRL algorithm in section 2. The detailed architecture of this algorithm along with computation and control process correlations are highlighted in section 2.1. Further, the experimental setup with measurement facility is explained in section 3. Section 4 methods detail the model variants along with the server mockup testing configurations. Energy saving effects of the fan (single and zone wise) and observation characteristics are analyzed in the result section for the entire server with ten fans in section 5. Further, five variants of this algorithm (model 1\u20135) were constructed for various algorithm settings and are compared for energy saving criterion for three server configurations to conclude the research summary in section 6. 2 Deep Reinforcement Learning: Depth Deterministic strategy gradient (DDSG) algorithm DDSG algorithm is based on the structure of the actor and critic neural network (Fig. 2 (a)) which is similar to most of the multi-objective DRL [27] such as DDSG. The actor is responsible for behavioral decisions and the critic is evaluated according to the behavior made by the actor. Actor and critic are composed of the evaluate network and the target network respectively. Thus, there are a total of four neural networks in the algorithm. The algorithm assigns some data from the data buffer for training. The training process will initialize the actor and critic neural network parameters. The actor network is updated by the policy gradient. The actor's current state and output actions are passed to the critic network for evaluation and gradient updates. The critic network is updated with its parameters by the loss function. The loss function is the error value between the Q value generated by the currently selected decision and the sum of reward (r) and Q value of the next state in the critic network based on the current network. Although DDSG is an off-policy algorithm, the policy learning can be defined as the action that maximizes the Q-function. Therefore, DDSG trains the deterministic policy in an off-policy way to find the useful learning signals for the proper action execution. After several iterations, the parameters are updated from the evaluate network to the target network as a soft update. The new network parameters are the replication part of the evaluate network plus some of the target network parameters. This overall target network parameters in this method slow down the learning speed by significantly improving the learning stability. In this study, the selected parameters are divided into heat transfer characteristics, server configuration, and cooling system (Fig. 2 (b)). The agent understands the internal environment of the server system through the above parameter indicators and gives the decision action according to this state. The decision-making used in this study is the output action of the fan\u2019s current Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) duty cycle (control action parameter). The duty cycle is expressed as the ratio of working time to the total time over a period of time. The three types of index parameters (indicators) and control action parameters of the above observation characteristics are shown in Fig. 2 (b). 2.1 Algorithm process The process of the DDSG algorithm in this study is shown in Fig. 3 . Before training, sufficient training data was generated into the data buffer. Subsequently, the server configuration and external environment conditions were randomly initiated with action strategies. Accordingly, the changes generated by the system will be the next server state, and the reward value of the action will be evaluated. The data will be recorded in the data buffer in the form of (s, a, r, s'). Where, s \u2013 state, a \u2013 action, r \u2013 reward and s\u2019 \u2013 next state. To build up the data buffer, the process of randomly generating action strategies can help the algorithm with the environmental changes caused by various action strategies. Throughout the algorithm training process, the current neural network parameters for actor will be regularly used to generate decisions and interact with the randomly configured environment. It observes the agent's action decisions to assess whether to continue training, and in the process, the test data is obtained in the data buffer for later training. The training phase implementation starts from the database creation, geometrical and environmental setup, initialize the neural network parameters to generate desired actions (steps 1 to 7 detailed further). After this process of training, the testing starts for a fixed time on the server mockup. The actions generated from the training is used to control the fans during the testing period. In the current study, various server configurations were prepared and there are many input variables that can create multiple batches. For a typical 1000 batch size, the training of the algorithm takes around 1.5 h on i5, four core desktop PC and the testing time is around 10 min. This study simplifies the server heat transfer model based on the following assumptions. 1. The server is a one-dimensional model with a single inlet\u2013outlet channel. There is no additional pressure difference caused by an external flow field outside this model. Under this assumption, fan static pressure is equal to the total channel pressure drop alongside the server. 2. The influence of the entrance region on forced convection is ignored. 3. The space between the different rows within the server (gray area of Fig. 4 ) is sufficient for the upstream flow field to be uniformly redistributed/mixed to yield a balanced state into the subsequent row (downstream). 4. The main heat dissipation is via the airflow passing through the heat sink, and the heat exchange between the bypass flow and heat source is negligible. 5. The airflow into the heat sink is fully contained and will not mix with the bypass stream. In addition to the above-mentioned assumptions, simplifications were made to the distribution of heat sources in the server as shown in Fig. 4. In a server system, several heat sources are configured and arranged according to the fluid flow direction, and each row is connected in series to form upstream and downstream. The downstream inlet will inherit the fluid properties of the upstream outlet; the heat sinks in the same row are in parallel configuration. This assumption provides a single and regular geometric form for the subsequent calculation model. With these aforementioned assumptions, the space in the server can be arranged into multiple imaginary regions as depicted in Fig. 4. Only one heat sink exists in a single region. At the same time, since bypass occurs for such geometric configuration, the heat sink cannot completely occupy the flow channel in a cross-sectional space (or row). The pressure drop and heat transfer empirical relations were used from the similar designed server model [26]. Based on the basic environmental assumptions, the transient heat transfer calculation process for this study is shown in Fig. 5 and details are given in the following steps and the variables are defined in the nomenclature. (1) Environment initialization: According to the initial configuration, the needed geometric parameters are calculated first. The number and performance of the selected fans are stored, and then the number of required transient loops is distributed according to the allocation of the configuration. These initialized parameters are calculated as the starting point of iteration. (2) Pressure drop: The static pressure of the fan is equal to the total pressure drop of the airflow across the server. Each row in the server has N ch channels in parallel. From the conservation of mass (eq.1 & 2), the average flow rate and channel velocity ( V d ) of N ch channels can be determined. The total pressure drops of the channel are used to calculate the system pressure drop which is equal to the sum of the pressure drop of each row (Eq. (2)). The coefficients ( n 1 , n 2 , n 3 , n 4 , n 5 ) in Eq. (1) are referred from the previous study [18].

(3) Airflow correction: The air flow calculated in Eq. (1) is different from the equilibrium airflow of the system, and the difference between these two values is corrected in this step. The corrected flow rate is shown in Fig. 6 (a) where Q tot , i t e r is the flow rate calculated in this iteration. According to the calculation from Eqs. (1) to (2), Δ P tot can be obtained, and Q tot , i t e r / N fan is the current flow of a single fan. The static pressure of the fan at this time can be inversely calculated by the interpolation method of Δ P fan . (4) Velocity distribution within each channel: Considering the pressure drop and ignoring the influence of gravity, the Bernoulli equations for airflow passing through the heat sink and the bypass section are listed in Eqs. (3) & (4). The representative meaning of each pressure drop is shown in Fig. 6(b). The pressure drop of the contraction segment and the expansion segment is computed from Eqs. (5) & (6) [26]. The frictional pressure drop is estimated by the duct flow pressure drop model from Eq. (7), the turbulent friction coefficient ( f turbulence ) is determined by the Blasius empirical (Eq. (7)), the laminar friction coefficient ( f laminar ) by Eq. (8) along with Reynolds number. The hydraulic diameter of the bypass channel of the cross-sectional was calculated by Eq. (9). Eq. (10) is obtained by subtracting Eq. (3) & (4). Since the pressure drop in the channel is mainly because of the heat sink can be approximated by Eq. (11). Then, the bypass section velocity is determined by the conservation of mass from Eq. (11). Fin velocity was evaluated using the quadratic equation of the heat sink flow rate from Eqs. (12) and (13).

(14). Heat dissipation ( Q remove ) is determined from Eqs. (15) & (16) assuming that the outlet temperature of the bypass area is equal to the inlet temperature. The coefficients ( m 1 , m 2 , m 3 , m 4 , m 5 ) in Eq. (16) are referred from the previous study [18].

(17). The left-hand side of the equation is the known mass flow rate at downstream ( M int ), and the right-hand side denotes the upstream value of the integrated range to be determined. Then, using the same iterative method, the height ratio r H of the source of upstream air can be calculated from Eq. (17). The downstream temperature of the air can be calculated from Eq. (18). Eq. (19) shows σ y which is the height ratio of the upstream bypass.

This dataset involves the current experimental testing server configuration details along with the previous test training data. A simulated server was constructed as the test section which contains heat sources, fans and heat sinks. The front and rear openings of this test segment act as the inlet of the airflow and the exhaust fan was placed at the exit as shown in Fig. 7 . Two power supplies are used to power the heat source and fan. The heat source modules (maximum 150 W) are ceramic heater and LM35 series precision integrated-circuit temperature sensor (by Texas instrument) was positioned at the center to measure the junction temperature of the heat source (Fig. 8 (a)). Insulated Bakelite was used at the base surface to reduce the heat loss. Thermal resistance from the heat source to ambience is listed in Table 2 . The ceramic heating plate was connected to a 24 V power supply for heat generation. For easier regulating the supplied power, a high-power ceramic disc variable resistance is used in the circuit for power adjustment (Fig. 8(b)). The relationship between variable resistance impedance and power distribution is shown in Fig. 8(c) under ideal conditions where the heater contains a nearly constant temperature at room temperature. In this study, a fan dedicated to the size of a 1U server was configured as an exhaust fan and all fans were connected in parallel to a 12 V power supply. Raspberry Pi was used to monitor, record and develop control strategies based on the DRL algorithm. A real time feedback loop was created in the experimental setup for signal transmission according to the algorithm action commands for fan speed control. The uncertainty of the measured parameters was calculated from the previous study [18] and tabulated in Table 3 . The fan is the key element to control the temperature of the heat source. Therefore, for the initial testings, the server was configured with a specific location of the heat source. The heat source configuration has three columns, close to the entrance is the first row of heat sources that has in-line circular pin fin configuration (Fig. 9 (a)) and the second and third rows contain rectangular fins. Ten fans with the same size are connected in parallel at the exit of the server. The detailed server specifications are provided in Table 4 . The relative positions of the heat source schematics are highlighted in Fig. 9 along with the fan curve. For further testing based on these initial experimental outcomes, the server configurations and DDSG model variants are updated in next section. 4 Methods: Three server configurations and five model variants This section highlights the details of the DDSG model variants for various reward functions along with the three new server configuration details. Three different server configurations were selected for testing the algorithm with experimental testing as shown in Fig. 10 along with the specifications in Table 6 for the five model variants. These server contains eight fans and are divided into two zones with each one containing four fans. Therefore, with reference to the initial results (section 5.1 and 5.2 based on server mockup testing as shown in Fig. 9), a single-zone fan control strategy is used in these models. The algorithm will take effect in the following sequence. Upon overheating, the agent will immediately give an instant action to reduce the temperature of the overheated heat source. The system is maintained under normal operation when overheated situations are not encountered. The agent's action will find a suitable operating point to facilitate effective heat transfer from the heat source through fan cooling. The follow-up is to confirm whether the model can effectively control the temperature in the real situation, and achieve the effect of energy saving accordingly. The first configuration (config 1) has two heat source modules in the first and the second row where rectangular fins are used as heat sinks. The second configuration (config 2) has two heat source modules in the first row and three modules in the second row. The third configuration (config 3) is similar to config 2 with two additional pin fin modules at the first row of heat sources. These three configurations are a standard 1U server with eight fans (Sanyo Electric San Ace 9GA0412P3M01) being packed side by side at the server exhaust. The controlling parameters for the algorithm are tabulated in Table 5 . The rectified linear activation function or ReLU in this study is a piecewise linear function that helps to output the summed weighted inputs. The time step was decided considering the Raspberry Pi response time in the server testing which is 1 s for this research study. The experimental results of the temperature changes for the heat source temperature subject to fan duty cycle in these three configurations are compared with the prediction of the algorithm. Five control models were developed and tested with experiments for various variables and reward functions as listed in Table 7 on three server configurations with different algorithmic settings for energy saving optimizations. 4.1 Model 1: Reward principle based on heat generation Notice that every decision-making action of the agent changes the environment that gives a reward value based on the state of the environment to judge the pros and cons of the decision-making action based on the reward principles (Eq. (22)). H gen , t o t in the non-overheating state is the sum of the total power consumption of all heat sources in the server and P fan is the sum of power consumption of all fans. The ratio of these two is used to evaluate the reward of the action. For a fixed heat source in the same configuration, the reward value is higher if it can dissipate heat with smaller fan power consumption. Reward value (r) range (0\u20131) is mainly designed with a tangent function that helps to train the critic neural network for convergence. Normal state: (22) r = 0.9 ∗ tan - 1 H gen , t o t 2 P fan - 15 + 0.5 π π + 0.1 Overheating state: Temperature drop: r = 0.1 ; Temperature rise: r = 0 . 4.2 Model 2: Reward principle based on the temperature The control of config 1 and 3 in Model 1 can effectively control the temperature of the heat source near the upper temperature limit (Fig. 12). However, in the case of config 2, the temperature of the highest heat source was lower. Therefore, it is expected that the agent can instantly respond the status of the server by modifying the reward function and adjusting the variables of the reward function (Eq. (23)). In the reward function, the original total heat output of the server ( H gen , t o t ) is adjusted to the highest temperature of the internal heat source ( T max ) as a variable. The approach is quite essential in practice because normally only temperatures are the major measurable parameters rather than heat dissipation. The ratio of the highest temperature heat source to the total power consumption of the fan is used as the definition of the reward function (r) in this model. (23) N o r m a l s t a t e r = 0.9 ∗ tan - 1 T max P fan 0.5 - 10 + 0.5 π π + 0.1 Overheated state Temperature drops: r = 0.1 ; Temperature rises: r = 0 . 4.3 Model 3: Normalize temperature and fan energy consumption After the first correction in Model 2, the temperature control and energy-saving have been significantly improved in some configurations. If a larger or smaller fan is used, it may cause uneven distribution of the feedback reward function, resulting in temperature scattering of the heat sources. Tailor this issue, some normalizations of the measure variables are made into Model 3 from Eqs. (24) & (25). (24) T hs , n o r = m a x T hs T limit + Δ T ; P fan , n o r = P fan , c u r r e n t , t o t P fan , m a x , t o t Normal state: (25) r = 0.9 ∗ tan - 1 7 ∗ T hs , n o r P fan , n o r - 15 + 0.5 π π + 0.1 Overheating state: Temperature drop: r = 0.1 ; Temperature rise: r = 0 . 4.4 Model 4: Reward values with a continuous function The previous model failed to effectively improve the decision-making action after the overheating phenomenon occurred, and hence the reward function is corrected in response to the overheating state in Model 4. The original reward value given by the overheating has two fixed values. r is 0.1 if the temperature drops after overheating, and r = 0 if it continues to rise. The preliminary judgment can cause the agent to have a discontinuous decision upon overheating. The agent cannot effectively differentiate the difference during the operation. Therefore, the reward value of the overheating state is limited from 0 to 0.1 through the tangent function (Eq. (28)). The product of the overheating degree ( T oh ) and the normalized overheating temperature ( T hs , n o r , o h ) is used to calculate the reward value after the overheating (Eqs. (26)\u2013(28)). (26) T oh = T hs - T limit ; T hs , n o r = m a x T hs + Δ T T limit (27) T hs , n o r , o h = T hs T limit ; P fan , n o r = P fan , c u r r e n t , t o t P fan , m a x , t o t Normal state: (28) r = 0.9 ∗ tan - 1 7 ∗ T hs , n o r P fan , n o r - 5 + 0.5 π π + 0.1 Overheating status: r = - 0.05 ∗ tan - 1 m a x ( T oh ∗ T hs , n o r , o h ) + 0.1 For Model 1, 2, 3 there were eight fans in the server configurations. However, in Model 4 and 5, the server configurations have six fans in two zones and each one contains three fans. As far as energy-saving is concerned, the number of fans was reduced to six for heat dissipation. 4.5 Model 5: Adjust the temperature and proportion of fan energy consumption ratio The agent acts quite sensitive in a certain interval of the temperature to yield a drastic change in the previous model. The change before and after this interval is very small, and hence the agent cannot provide a clear judgment directly through the reward function. Therefore, by using Eqs. (29)\u2013(32), the temperature difference is reduced, so that the reward function can have a more precise value for the agent to evaluate under each energy consumption situation. (29) T oh = T hs - T limit ; T hs , n o r = m a x T hs + Δ T T limit (30) T hs , n o r , o h = T hs T limit ; P fan , n o r = P fan , c u r r e n t , t o t P fan , m a x , t o t Normal state: (31) r = 0.9 ∗ tan - 1 3 ∗ T hs , n o r 2 P fan , n o r - 5 + 0.5 π π + 0.1 Overheating state: (32) r = - 0.05 ∗ tan - 1 max ( T oh ∗ T hs , n o r , o h ) + 0.1 5 Results and discussion This section details the energy saving aspect analysis by various DRL control algorithm variations using simulations-experiments and provides the optimized model. In the current configuration (Fig. 9), the upper limit of the temperature of the heat source in the first column is 80 °C, and for the second and third columns is 100 °C. If the upper limit temperature is exceeded, it is defined as overheated. Therefore, the control of the heat source temperature and the power consumption of the fan is one of the imperative discussions in this research analysis. In view of the simulation results of changing the fan control method, the fan power consumption, usage rate, and the overall proportion of its energy consumption ratio under different control methods are highlighted in this section. Fan energy is computed using the pressure drop (Eq. (1)), number of fans and the testing time of the server mockup, and fan RPM ratio based in fan power law.

Eq. (22) and Table 8 shows the details for the states and reward function for the current server mockup algorithm. It can be observed from Fig. 11 (a) that significant overheating occurs at the beginning. After 200 s, the temperature fluctuation is significantly reduced while some overheating still persists. The cause of overheating in the early stage each time is the action generated for a single fan has negligible impact on the heat dissipation of the overall system when overheating begins. Consequently, the temperature does not decrease but increases at the beginning. Yet, later temperature change tends to stabilize the overheating phenomenon, and the temperature is maintained closely to the upper limit of the heat source temperature. Although the temperature control is slightly delayed by this control method, the drastic change in the overall fan action is significantly reduced. Adjusting a single fan showed a longer time to react once the overheating appears. Note that this may cause catastrophic failure of electronic components. Therefore, the fan control method is adjusted to be zone-wise. Fans were evenly distributed in several zones and randomly selected in any zone to give the action value. For the studied server configuration detailed in Fig. 9, the server has ten fans. These ten fans divided into two zone and any one of the zones was selected to give action value during the testing. Through this adjustment, the continuous occurrence of overheating can be reduced appreciably. It can be observed from Fig. 11(b) in which the temperature control is more effective than that of changing a single fan. The temperature is close to the upper limit. Adjusting multiple fans can control the temperature more quickly, but the fan switching frequency is relatively higher, thereby lowering the temperature significantly. Changing the control of an individual fan at a time and the fans in different zones have shown considerable energy-saving of 39 \u2013 47 % compared with the conjoint-fan control method (Table 9 ). Server mockup testing was conducted for a fixed time period and therefore, the unit of energy power (kJ) which represents the total energy consumption is used for the fan power consumption in this research. Either individual fan control or single zone control shows a significant reduction in the fan power consumption. However, there is a big difference in the temperature control. Changing the temperature control of the fan one by one is inferior to the single-zone fan control. This is mainly because it requires a relatively long time for the fan to perform the cooling action to meet the required cooling effect by adjusting the fans one by one. Yet, the control of an individual fan with some algorithm variable changes might not be practical. Therefore, in further tests, individual fan control is used to discuss the temperature control for the maximum energy-saving effect. 5.2 Energy-saving effects by the influence of model observation characteristics In the previous results, although the phenomenon of continuous overheating was effectively eliminated, the phenomenon still exists in the later stage. Therefore, observation characteristics such as the standard deviation of heat generation, heat capacity, heat sink area, and temperature are changed to the maximum value. After the correction of the observed characteristic values, the fan usage rate and the portion of energy consumption are slightly increased to 15.6 % and 4.47 %, respectively (Table 10 ). However, the temperature control is relatively good, although there is still some overheating. Therefore, after adjusting the characteristic status and overheating temperature conditions later, the utilization rate dropped significantly to 8.3 % compared with the previous result (45.2 % reduction compared with the original state feature model). The temperature of the entire system has been effectively controlled, and the temperature fluctuation also becomes smaller. Maintaining the maximum effective temperature makes the energy consumption of fan cooling to 3.98 %, which greatly reduces energy consumption and improves the energy saving effect. Finally, the judgment of the overheating message is corrected. Although the usage rate has increased by 2 % with an increase of 4.97 % energy consumption ratio, there is no overheating in the temperature control. The temperature drop enables the agent to react immediately with a slight increase in the fan energy consumption. 5.3 Algorithm control test: three server configurations for five model variants Detailed control results are discussed for model 1 to 5 in this section as shown in Fig. 12. The reward function for these models is briefed in Section 4. Model 1: In case of close to overheating for config 1 (Fig. 12), the fan speed increased to dissipate heat, and once the temperature has successfully dropped, the speed was reduced. It maintained the maximum temperature near the upper limit temperature. Although config 2 greatly avoids overheating, it also consumes excessive energy of fans for heat dissipation. Config 3 is close to the control of config 1, when overheating occurs, the temperature rise will be controlled by increasing the fan speed. Although the actions can effectively reduce the range of temperature variations, the temperature trend is still slightly upward in the early stage of overheating. The temperature rise was successfully controlled in the later stage, and finally, the overheating phenomenon was successfully eliminated and the fan speed was reduced. It can also be found from this configuration that the agent can find a more suitable action to dissipate heat in the case of overheating. The actions taken by these three configuration agents are different, which means that the control model trained this time is still effective for temperature control under different configurations. However, further optimization of the system energy saving aspects without overheating is explored in subsequent models. Model 2: The reward value is returned by modifying the variable of the reward function to the highest heat source under this configuration. Compared with the original model, the control result of config 1 is higher (Fig. 12), and the agent takes a higher action to make a slight drop in the temperature by avoiding the phenomenon that the temperature is greater than the overheating temperature. The control result of config 2 still maintains a low temperature situation, and there is still a substantial increase in terms of energy-saving (Table 11 ). Compared with Model 1, the agent can immediately take strong actions to dissipate heat when it is about to overheat for config 3, thereby suppressing the temperature and maintaining the server that can continue to operate at a higher temperature of each heat source to reduce the fan energy consumption. This configuration is under normal operation, which greatly improves the energy-saving of the system. Compared with Model 1, the control of temperature and energy saving has been improved in config 1 and 3. However, the temperature for config 2 is still too low with a significant use of fan energy. Therefore, Model 3 is designed to further improve the previous models. Model 3: Adjusting the design concept of the reward principle, the trained model was verified through experiments for three server configurations. The actions taken by config 1 and 2 are too large, resulting in lower heat source temperature results (Fig. 12). In config 3, the temperature is lower than the previous two results, but it is still near the upper temperature limit. In terms of overall control results, the energy-saving effect is not the best compared to the previous models, but it is successful to control the temperature. Model 3.2 (addition of experimental dataset into model 3): The temperature of the entire maximum overheat source is close to its upper temperature limit (config 1 & 3 (Fig. 12)). This is mainly because the taken actions by the agent have been adjusted. With the past training, it can use a smaller speed to dissipate heat under normal operating conditions. Config 2 is slightly improved compared to the previous models. In the control results of config 3, it can be seen that when the system is close to the overheating temperature, the agent can also make effective decisions to suppress the temperature rise of the heat source. To avoid overheating, the fan speed is directly increased to the maximum, and the use of fan energy is relatively increased which revealed the inability to handle the overheating for config 1 & 3. Additional training using experimental datasets in Model 3.2 has improved the control results compared to Model 3 except for the decision action during the overheating phase. Therefore, further models are updated using a continuous function for the reward values. Model 4: For Model 1, 2, 3 & 3.2 there were eight fans in the server configurations. However, in Model 4, 5 and 5.2 server configurations have six fans in two zones with each one having three fans. To achieve more energy-saving optimization, the number of fans was reduced to six for heat dissipation. Config 1 and 2 show that the using higher fan actions to control the temperature to avoid overheating may result in excessive fan energy consumption. The maximum temperature was 78.7 °C, 64.05 °C and 92.69 °C for config 1, 2 & 3, respectively (Fig. 12). This indicates the model is very sensitive to the temperature with excessive fan action. Due to the excessive fan actions, the energy consumption ratio and the fan power consumption was observed to be very high in this model compared to the previous models. Therefore, the reward function is updated in Model 5. Model 5: The results of the control model take larger actions in config 1 and 2, and hence the temperature is still lower than the overheating temperature (Fig. 12). In config 3, the model showed successful improvement in the control action during the overheating phenomenon than the previous model. After overheating, effective actions are taken to suppress the temperature rise. When the overheating phenomenon is eliminated, the fan speed is reduced to save energy. Model 5.2 2 (addition of experimental dataset into model 5): It can be found that the actions are taken in config 1 and config 2 are relatively low with the addition of the past training so that the system heat source temperature is significantly increased to near the upper-temperature limit (Fig. 12). Config 3 adopts a higher action value to dissipate heat after overheating and also reduces the fan speed when it is not overheated to reduce unnecessary energy consumption. This model is updated to remedy the shortcomings of past models and hence shows the best control results compared to the previous models. However, these models were further reviewed to observe their control actions in terms of energy saving. 5.4 Comparison of algorithm control performance of each model This section compares all the model variants from Model 1 to 5 detailed in section 4. Model 3.5 & 5.2 are referred as the control results obtained after training based on the previous models with additional experimental data. It is observed from all five models that the Model 5.2 control is relatively ideal (Table 11). It can be seen that even no training is employed in this model, the temperature control still maintains a certain quality. The design of the reward function and the suitability of the agent's control have a considerable influence. Regardless of the weight of the fine-tuning variables, the control results obtained are very different in all the models. However, in each model, the temperature control has been successfully achieved. Fig. 13 and Table 11 show the operational time ratio (OTR) of the heat source (normal or overheated) and the portion of the fan power consumption under the control of different models. The operational time ratio is the time ratio of the non-overheat (normal) to the total operational time of the heat source. Time in seconds was monitored for the normal operation within the acceptable temperature range and the time above the maximum temperature range was termed as overheat. Model 1 is the original model, and subsequent revisions in accordance with the reward principle for the following models. After Model 4, the fan power consumption has significantly increased because of the subsequent use of six fans for cooling. No overheating was observed in config 1 and 2 after revising the reward principle. Therefore, the energy consumption of the fan is analyzed. Config 1 has good temperature control in the first three versions. Therefore, in Model 3.2, the temperature control is maintained at a higher temperature, and the power consumption is reduced from 5.25 % to 2.73 %. In the follow-up Model 4, to achieve more energy-saving optimization, the number of fans was reduced to six for heat dissipation. At the beginning of Model 4 (config 1), the fan usage rate was as high as 8.31 %, but it was reduced to 4.13 % (Model 5) by modifying the reward function. The addition of the experimental data into the data buffer (Model 5.2) further reduced the fan usage rate to 2.42 %. The energy-saving optimization effect of config 2 on the first three models is still relatively insignificant, but the addition of the experiment data helped to reduce the fan usage rate of Model 3 from 3.84 % to 1.94 % in Model 3.2. When six fans are used after Model 4, the original 7.09 % of fan usage rate in config 2 is reduced to 1.40 % in Model 5. Config 3 causes overheating, so the ratio of overheating and non-overheating time distribution is added in Fig. 13. For config 3 in initial Model 1, overheating accounted for 50 % of the control time. By adjusting the design of the reward principle, the overheating time was significantly reduced. Although the fan usage rate has been slightly increased from 2.05 % to 3.07 % from Model 1 to Model 3 respectively, the subsequent addition of actual data reduced it to 2.25 % in Model 3.2. According to the current results, the algorithm can judge the system status and successfully provide the real-time decision-making action thereby the energy consumption of the fan is significantly reduced. Implementation of this algorithm in a data center with tens to hundreds of servers can save significant energy. The validation of this study for different server configurations shows the robustness of the proposed DRL control algorithm for any type of server. In summary, the proposed DRL control can be easily implemented for the actual servers in data centers to reduce the energy consumptions on the server level. It is expected that the additional training datasets using different input variation patterns along with some failure scenarios can upgrade the control model. 6 Conclusions The current study aimed to control the energy saving and heat dissipation of 1U air-cooled server using AI based Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm with experimental verifications. The developed agent can handle complex thermal environmental interactions such as multiple heat sources with varying heat generation, type of heat sinks, bypass airflow, fan operation and the like. The purpose is to enable the system to maintain normal operation while saving cooling energy consumption at the server level irrespective of the cooling system architecture. Therefore, the temperature control and energy saving are optimized based on the state characteristics, fan control methods and reward functions. The following summary highlights the current study. 1. The power consumption of the fan can be reduced to 39 % and 47 % by controlling a single fan and single-zone fan compared with the full fan control method, respectively. 2. After the modification in observation characteristics from the average to the maximum value, and the reduction in the combination of state characteristics, the fan usage rate was reduced by 45 % compared with the single fan control original state feature model. 3. In order to allow the agent to have better control over the temperature of the system, the condition of restricting the overheating temperature of the observation feature effectively avoids the occurrence of overheating at the expense of 1 % increase in the system energy consumption. 4. The key factors that affect the stability of the server can be fed to the agent in the reward function. Modification of the reward function to evaluate the reward value based on the ratio of temperature to fan power consumption can accelerate the agent's evaluation of the system state. 5. Adjustment of the ratio by normalization of heat source temperature and fan power consumption for different server configurations allows the model to find better control actions. 6. The heat source of the three configurations in the test was close to the upper limit temperature and maintained stably by saving about 12 % to 50 % fan energy consumption due to the addition of the experimental data into the training. 7. From all models, the model 5.2 control result is relatively ideal because the temperature control still maintains a certain quality for the configuration. 8. The design of the reward function and the suitability of the agent's control have a considerable influence on the decision making control actions. 9. The addition of the real time experimental datasets into the model training showed a significant improvement in terms of energy-saving aspects. The unique contribution of this research is the addition of physical models to setup the server environment during the proposed algorithm training. The research conclusions from this study will be immensely helpful for the server and data center facility operators to implement the AI strategies to save system power consumption. Further testing of the server mockups along with the real servers and extending to the number of servers in one rack can be immensely helpful to extend the proposed AI algorithm to data center facility level cooling application.

The proposed algorithm can handle the server's complex thermal environment, including number of heat sources and their locations, type of heat sink, airflow, fan and bypass airflow. Based on the analysis and test results, it is found that controlling a single fan individually and the fans in different zones can offer the reduction of fan energy by 39\u201347% compared with the controlling all fans collectively. After the modification in observation characteristics, the fan usage rate was reduced by 45% compared with the single fan control model. Further, five different control models were developed and tested with experiments for different function variables and reward functions on three server configurations with different algorithmic settings for energy saving optimizations. The heat source of the three server configurations was close to the upper limit temperature and maintained stably by saving about 12% to 50% fan energy consumption. The algorithm can judge the system status and successfully provide real-time decision-making action thereby the energy consumption of the fan is significantly reduced.",
