Engineering Laboratory 111 865 Asp Ave. Norman OK 73019 USA Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based precooling strategies are typically analyzed through simulations. Their field studies in residential buildings are quite limited due to hardware retrofitting costs, lengthy parameter identification periods, and the need to have homeowners' participation. Therefore, there is a lack of MPC-based precooling impact analysis using field data which may have prevented widespread adoption of the technology. To address this issue, in this paper we developed an MPC agent and implemented it on an online cloud-based platform. The MPC agent makes use of a gray-box model to capture the home thermal dynamics, a novel set of constraints to ensure that the model parameters identified are realistic, and a node sensor to provide interior wall surface temperature measurement. To evaluate its performance and conduct impact analysis, we introduced a modified matrix profile-based weather clustering algorithm and two performance indicators for cost saving and energy flexibility. We also carried out extensive field tests on nine homes over a period of four months. Our results show that the MPC agent can reduce energy cost by 28.72%\u201351.31% on hot summer days and by up to 60.32% on mild summer days, in addition to achieving significant energy flexibility. Moreover, the agent's performance is found to be most impacted by weather conditions, AC performance, user comfort preferences, and floor areas of the homes.

Although renewable energy emits little to no greenhouse gas and is sustainable, it poses reliability risks to the grid due to its inherent variability. As a key driver of the electricity demand, residential buildings represent 21 % of the total energy consumption in 2021 [2]. Due to their high energy need and high energy flexibility, residential buildings have great potential in addressing grid reliability issues [3]. Therefore, many U.S. utilities offer Demand Response (DR) programs that include time-of-use (TOU) rates at the retail level to incentivize customers to shift their electricity usage from on-peak hours (when electricity prices are high) to off-peak hours (when they are low) [4]. Space cooling represents 16 % of the total electricity consumption in residential buildings across the U.S. This number will likely increase in the next 30 years due to climate and population changes [5]. Space cooling has therefore become a focal point in the study of DR operation. One popular topic that has received a lot of attention is precooling, where an AC overcools space during off-peak hours and uses the building structure as a passive thermal storage to avoid expensive operation during on-peak hours. The motivation of this study is to evaluate the cost saving and energy flexibility that is produced by precooling operation in real residential buildings under DR programs. To date, many precooling strategies have been studied including rule-based precooling control [6\u20138], optimal precooling control without feedback [9\u201311], reinforcement learning control [12], and Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based precooling control [13\u201319]. Among the existing strategies, both rule-based precooling control and optimal precooling control without feedback choose to not incorporate real-time information and revised forecast into their decision-making. On the other hand, reinforcement learning control requires a large number of training scenarios to make optimal decisions [20] although it does have a few advantages such as not requiring model pre-training. Therefore, MPC represents an attractive alternative to optimal precooling [21,22]. In building operation, the model used in MPC must not only be able to accurately capture the home thermal dynamics. It must also be simple enough to enable online operation. Such a model, along with a computationally economical optimization framework, is therefore essential to running MPC in real-time. In general, the performance of an MPC can be affected by many factors. In [23], the impact of weather conditions, home thermal conditions, prediction horizons, price structures, and rated cooling capacities on an MPC was investigated using MATLAB simulations, where it was assumed that the model had perfect temperature prediction. In [13], MATLAB and EnergyPlus simulations were performed to investigate the impact of different TOU structures and MPC prediction horizons. In [20], the authors utilized Python and EnergyPlus simulations to conduct an MPC study involving 500 buildings and discussed the impact of climate, floor area, and building age on energy saving and thermal comfort. Although [13,20,23] have contributed to the understanding of MPC performance in residential buildings, their results were obtained primarily using simulations and hence may have limited accuracy. To see how MPC performs in real residential buildings, a few experimental studies have been conducted [15,16,24]. In [15], the effectiveness of an MPC was investigated using a laboratory building containing a geothermal heat pump and a water tank to store energy. The MPC was first simulated in a computer to produce optimal control signals, which were then fed into the laboratory building for verification. The MPC did not actually use real feedback from the building, although it was nevertheless shown to enable load shifting and reduce electricity costs by 25 %\u201335 %. In [16], two different MPC formulations were considered in the context of heating (as opposed to precooling). Their controllers were implemented on a real residential building whose heat pump and PV (photo-voltaic) panels were installed virtually. Compared with a simulated rule-based controller, their controllers were found to decrease heating cost by 3 %\u20137% and increase energy flexibility significantly. Unlike [15] and [16] which considered a single residential building, [24] considered multiple (ten) such buildings in Switzerland and Germany. The authors employed neural networks to construct building and climate models for space heating, developed a custom-made MPC control system called NiQ, and installed it in each building for performance evaluation. It was found that approximately 1.8kWh of additional energy per day was needed for every degree Celsius of decrease in outdoor air temperature. Although the above publications have established the effectiveness of MPC in real residential buildings, they have a common drawback: their experiments were labor-intensive to set up, requiring significant effort in hardware retrofitting, model development, and post-analysis. Motivated by our initial goal to evaluate the cost saving and energy flexibility due to precooling, we have identified a pressing need to address this drawback. Consequently, the objective of this study is to investigate whether it is possible to develop an MPC for optimal precooling that can be seamlessly implemented in residential buildings, avoiding the aforementioned drawback and making impact analysis more easily conducted. In light of this objective, we have developed an MPC agent, implemented it to conduct MPC-based precooling, and analyzed it using field test results in test homes. The contributions of this study can be summarized as follows: i. An implementable MPC agent is developed that fully utilizes the Internet of Things (IoT) devices [25] that a home already has, such as smart thermostats with their built-in node sensors. Such an MPC agent eliminates the need for hardware retrofitting while still collecting sufficient data for training and control purposes. ii. A novel set of constraints is introduced for parameter identification in the reduced-order gray-box model utilized by the MPC agent. Using these constraints, more realistic values of the model parameters are obtained that accurately reflect how external conditions influence home thermal dynamics. iii. An extensive field test on nine homes with diverse characteristics and different TOU rates over a four-month period was carried out. iv. A detailed post-analysis of the field test results is presented. The analysis incorporates a modified matrix profile-based weather clustering algorithm to ensure a more equitable comparison and utilizes two performance indicators to represent the potential benefits stakeholders might derive from MPC-based precooling. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, an MPC agent, including a reduced-order gray-box model and its parameter identification, is described. Also described are an MILP problem formulation and two performance indicators. Section 3 describes an experimental setup for the MPC-based precooling test, including the participating test homes, cloud-based platform, and temperature and power measurements. Section 4 presents the field test results, demonstrates the weather clustering algorithm, and discusses possible factors that impact the results. Lastly, Section 5 formulates the conclusions. 2 Methodology To give an overall picture of the methodology of this paper, consider Fig. 1 which shows the MPC-based precooling workflow. At each time step of a precooling field test, the MPC agent uses a home thermal model (which contains the identified parameters) and additional information (TOU rate, thermal comfort range, weather forecast, AC power usage model, measured temperatures) to solve a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem, resulting in an optimal sequence of AC on/off signals along with future building states. The first AC on/off decision is then implemented on the test home via its smart thermostat. The process is repeated until the field test is over, after which the results are used to evaluate the cost saving and flexibility factor. The home thermal model and its parameter identification are detailed in Sections 2.1 and 2.2. The MILP formulation and MPC agent are described in Section 2.3. Finally, the two performance indices for evaluating the MPC agent are introduced in Section 2.4. 2.1 Home thermal model In this paper, we use a second-order resistance\u2013capacitance (RC)-based gray-box model to describe the thermal dynamics of a home and refer to it as the home thermal model. The reasons for our choice are as follows. First, a gray-box model for HVAC applications typically requires less effort to learn than a white-box model [26]. Since it is partially physics-based, a gray-box model also generally yields more accurate temperature prediction than a black-box model, especially in operating regimes where the models are not trained [18,27]. Second, RC networks of various orders have been widely used to model building thermal dynamics (e.g., 1R1C in [28], 3R2C plus 2R2C in [29], and 6R2C in [30]). For residential buildings, we believe that a second-order (i.e., 2R2C) model has the best trade-off between model accuracy and implementation cost: a first-order model, although simpler, would not be able to effectively separate the indoor air temperature dynamics (that usually respond faster to external changes) from the interior wall surface temperature dynamics (that usually respond slower). In contrast, a higher-order model, although potentially more accurate, would require more sensors to measure its states, making it costly to implement. The second-order RC-based gray-box model is given by: (1) d T ie dt = 1 τ 1 T o - T ie + 1 τ 2 T in - T ie (2) d T in dt = 1 τ 3 T ie - T in + 1 τ 3 a 1 S + a 2 S 2 + 1 τ 3 T o - T in b 1 W + b 2 W 2 + 1 τ 3 c 1 T o + c 2 T o 2 u , where t denotes time, T ie is the interior wall surface temperature, T in is the indoor air temperature, T o is the outdoor air temperature, S is the solar irradiation, W is the wind speed, and u ∈ { 0 , 1 } is the AC on/off signal. Note that (1) and (2) contain a total of nine unknown parameters: τ 1 is the time constant of the building envelope, τ 2 is a coefficient associated with the thermal resistance of air and thermal capacitance of the building envelope, τ 3 is the time constant of the indoor air, and a 1 , a 2 , b 1 , b 2 , c 1 , c 2 are coefficients representing the impact of solar irradiation, wind speed, and AC output, respectively. Also note that in general, the AC output mainly depends on both T o and indoor air web bulb temperature. However, the latter has relatively small variation compared to T o and, thus, is neglected. This allows us to represent the AC output as 1 τ 3 c 1 T o + c 2 T o 2 u in (2), which also ensures that the model is linear in T ie , T in , and u . 2.2 Parameter identification for home thermal model To identify the nine unknown parameters in (1) and (2), we first discretize these two equations and then consider an optimization problem having the following objective function: (3) m i n P ∑ k = 1 N t r a i n T in k - T in , m e a s k 2 + T ie k - T ie , m e a s k 2 where P = τ 1 , τ 2 , τ 3 , a 1 , a 2 , b 1 , b 2 , c 1 , c 2 contains the optimization variables, T in k and T ie k represent the indoor air temperature and the interior wall surface temperature at time step k , T in , m e a s k and T ie , m e a s k represent their measurements, and N t r a i n represents the number of time steps in the training dataset. The constraints for this optimization problem are: (4) T ie k = Δ t τ 1 T o k - 1 - T ie k - 1 + Δ t τ 2 T in k - 1 - T ie k - 1 + T ie k - 1 f o r k = 2 , ⋯ , N t r a i n (5) T in k = Δ t τ 3 T ie k - 1 - T in k - 1 + Δ t τ 3 a 1 S k - 1 + a 2 S k - 1 2 + Δ t τ 3 T o k - 1 - T in k - 1 b 1 W k - 1 + b 2 W k - 1 2 + Δ t τ 3 c 1 T o k - 1 + c 2 T o k - 1 2 u k - 1 + T in k - 1 f o r k = 2 , ⋯ , N t r a i n (6) a 1 ≥ 0 (7) a 2 ≥ - 0.5 a 1 (8) c 2 ≥ 0 (9) c 1 ≤ - 120 c 2 (10) c 1 ≥ - 140 c 2 . Here, (4) and (5) are obtained by discretizing (1) and (2) using the forward Euler method with sampling period Δ t (5 min). In general, parameter identification can yield multiple sets of values having similar performances. The presence of physics and empirically driven constraints (6)\u2013(10) ensures that the set of values that makes most physical sense gets selected. Constraints (6) and (7) are motivated by the fact that the solar impact a 1 S + a 2 S 2 in (2) should be zero when solar irradiation S is zero, and should increase with S until a maximum possible value S max of 1 (i.e., normalized). To ensure this behavior, the parabola a 1 S + a 2 S 2 can be either convex or concave, as illustrated in Fig. 2 (a) by the green and red curves. If it is convex a 2 ≥ 0 , its smallest root must be non-positive - a 1 a 2 ≤ 0 , meaning that a 1 , a 2 must lie in the green region in Fig. 2(b). If it is concave a 2 ≤ 0 , the x-coordinate of its vertex must exceed S max = 1 - a 1 2 a 2 ≥ 1 , meaning that a 1 , a 2 must lie in the red region. Taking the union of these two regions, we obtain (6) and (7). Constraints (8)\u2013(10) are motivated by the fact that the AC output c 1 T o + c 2 T o 2 u in (2) cools the temperature and thus should be negative for all practical values of T o during a typical summer. It also should increase with T o over the interval from 70 °F to 120 °F because as outdoor air\u2014which may be regarded as the air entering the condenser\u2014gets hotter, the condensation temperature gets higher, reducing the AC output. To satisfy these two conditions, the parabola c 1 T o + c 2 T o 2 must be convex c 2 ≥ 0 , its largest root must exceed 120 °F - c 1 c 2 ≥ 120 , and the x-coordinate of its vertex must stay below 70 °F - c 1 2 c 2 ≤ 70 , leading to (8)\u2013(10). 2.3 MILP problem formulation Having described the home thermal model, in this subsection we introduce the MPC agent. At the heart of the MPC agent is a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem for optimal precooling to be solved at each time step k . The objective function of this MILP problem is given by: (11) min U ∑ m = k k + N p r i c e m P m u m + w v m , where U = u k , ⋯ , u k + N , v k , ⋯ , v k + N is a vector of decision variables, N is the length of the optimization horizon, pric e m is the TOU rate at time step m , P m represents the total AC power usage, u m ∈ { 0 , 1 } is the AC on/off signal, v m ∈ R ≥ 0 is a non-negative slack variable intended for penalizing indoor air temperature deviation from a thermal comfort range, and w is a weight for the slack variables. The total AC power usage P m is modeled by: (12) P m = P indoor + P outdoor m = P indoor + A 1 T o m + A 2 T o m 2 + A 3 T o m 3 + A 4 f o r m = k , ⋯ , k + N , where P indoor is the constant indoor unit power, P outdoor m is the variable outdoor unit power assumed to be a polynomial function of T o m , and A 1 , A 2 , A 3 , A 4 are coefficients that can be experimentally determined. The constraints of the MILP problem are given by: T ie m = Δ t τ 1 T o m - 1 - T ie m - 1 + Δ t τ 2 T in m - 1 - T ie m - 1 + T ie m - 1 (13) f o r m = k + 1 , ⋯ , k + N T in m = Δ t τ 3 T ie m - 1 - T in m - 1 + Δ t τ 3 a 1 S m - 1 + a 2 S m - 1 2 + Δ t τ 3 T o m - 1 - T in m - 1 b 1 W m - 1 + b 2 W m - 1 2 + Δ t τ 3 c 1 T o m - 1 + c 2 T o m - 1 2 u m - 1 + T in m - 1 (14) f o r m = k + 1 , ⋯ , k + N (15) T lb m - v m ≤ T in m ≤ T ub m + v m f o r m = k , ⋯ , k + N (16) u m ∈ { 0 , 1 } f o r m = k , ⋯ , k + N (17) v m ∈ R ≥ 0 f o r m = k , ⋯ , k + N , where (13) and (14) are taken from (4) and (5), (15) represents soft constraints on thermal comfort, T lb m and T ub m are lower and upper bounds on T in m , (16) ensures that u m is binary, and (17) forces v m to be non-negative. Notice that the MILP problem makes use of two initial conditions T in k and T ie k , which come from real-time measurements at time step k . In general, the MILP problem may be infeasible because, for example, the forecasted outdoor air temperature is too high for the AC to keep up, or the homeowner\u2019s thermal comfort range is too narrow for the indoor air temperature to stay in. Such infeasibility may cause the MPC agent to crash. To ensure that the MILP problem is always feasible, instead of using hard temperature constraints T lb m ≤ T in m ≤ T ub m f o r m = k , ⋯ , k + N , we \u201csoften\u201d them by inserting into (15) a non-negative slack variable v m which represents the degree to which the hard temperature constraints are violated. Since such a violation is undesirable, we also insert into the objective function (11) the term wv m , which only imposes a penalty when T in m turns out to be higher than T ub m or lower than T lb m . In other words, the temperature constraints are relaxed only when necessary. Fig. 3 provides a graphical description of how the MPC agent operates. As illustrated by the figure, at each time step k , the home thermal model (i.e., 2R2C model) receives the identified values of its parameters, weather forecasts over the optimization horizon, and both the indoor air and interior wall surface temperature measurements. The MPC agent then uses the home thermal model along with the TOU rate, the identified parameters of the total AC power usage model, and the thermal comfort upper and lower bounds, to generate the objective function and constraints of the MILP problem. The MILP problem is subsequently solved to produce optimal sequences of AC on/off signals and slack variables. Lastly, the MPC agent implements only the first element of the optimal sequence of AC on/off signals by adjusting the temperature setpoint at the smart thermostat in such a way that the AC is forced to turn on or off until the next time step. 2.4 Performance indicators for MPC agent Two performance indicators are used to evaluate the performance of the MPC agent. Based on (11), the 24-hour AC operation cost C is given by: (18) C = Δ t T ∑ m = 1 N 24 h p r i c e m P m u m , where T is a unit conversion factor chosen so that C has unit dollar, m = 1 represents the beginning of a 24-hour period, and m = N 24 h represents the end. With C , we can define cost saving J- the first performance indicator-as: (19) J = C baseline - C mpc C baseline × 100 % , where C mpc is the 24-hour AC operation cost with the MPC agent, and C baseline is the cost without (i.e., the AC is under normal operation). Although cost saving J is a useful indicator of the MPC agent\u2019s effectiveness, it does not fully reflect the latter\u2019s load-shifting ability. To address this limitation, among metrics for evaluating energy flexibility [16,31\u201333], we adopt the so-called flexibility factor FF\u2014the second performance indicator\u2014defined as: (20) FF = ∫ L low P d t - ∫ L high P d t ∫ L low P d t + ∫ L high P d t , where L low L high represents the time interval over which the off-peak (on-peak) hours defined by the TOU rate take place and P is the total AC power usage first defined in (12). Note that FF is always between −1 and 1, where −1 means energy is consumed entirely during on-peak hours, while 1 means it is consumed entirely during off-peak hours. Therefore, flexibility factor FF quantifies the load-shifting effectiveness of the MPC agent. 3 Experimental setup In this section, we introduce the experimental setup for the MPC-based precooling test, including the participating test homes, the cloud-based platform for data management and control, and the temperature and power measurement setup in those homes. 3.1 Participating test homes The test homes include ten single-family homes in Norman, Oklahoma, and one single-family home in Miami, Florida. To ensure that a diverse set of test homes were chosen, a survey was carried out for each home to gather its building characteristics including its floor area, building age, building structure material, AC unit condition, and whether the homeowner had signed up for a TOU rate. The survey result is tabulated in Table 1 . Except for what we refer to as the Lab House near the University of Oklahoma, the test homes were labeled alphabetically based on the order in which they were registered. Fig. 4 shows the distribution of floor areas, count plot of AC tonnage, building ages, and AC unit service time for the 11 test homes. As can be seen from Fig. 4, the test homes were diversely distributed in terms of building and AC characteristics. Although there were 11 test homes, two withdrew from participation shortly after the field test began (Home F was sold and Home H had thermostat incompatibility issues). In addition, during the test period, only two participants (Home C and Home J) enrolled in TOU programs. For the rest who did not enroll, we still carried out the MPC-based precooling test as if they did. Depending on their locations and the utility services they use, we assigned one of the following TOU programs (i.e., rate structures) to these homes: Oklahoma Gas & Electric (OG&E) Smart Hours [34] where on-peak hours run from 2 pm to 7 pm, Oklahoma Electric Corporate (OEC) TOU rate [35] where on-peak hours run from 3 pm to 7 pm, and Florida Power and Light (FPL) TOU rate [36] where on-peak hours run from 12 pm to 9 pm. Thanks to our research sponsors, all the homes were equipped with smart thermostats and node sensors, among which five (Home A, Home B, Home I, Home J, and the Lab House) also had smart power meters installed for collecting indoor and outdoor power measurements. For those houses without smart power meters, the total AC power usage P in (12) was assumed to be a constant that depends on the AC model. The upper and lower temperature bounds in the MPC-based precooling test were determined based on observed homeowner preferences during normal operation and on what they considered to be acceptable during the test. Fig. 5 presents the Gaussianized setpoint distribution of several homes during normal operation (black) and during the test (red). Note that a 90 °F setpoint was assigned when a homeowner decided to manually turn off the AC. Also note that because the Lab House was unoccupied, its temperature bounds can be freely chosen. As such, the bounds were set to different values to allow us to examine their impact. 3.2 Cloud-based platform for data management and control The proposed cloud-based platform is shown in Fig. 6 . This platform was developed using Python and supports several functions of IoT devices including data communication, alert system, and remote control. To run the MPC-based precooling test on the platform, three types of datasets were required: parameter identification dataset, real-time control dataset, and post-analysis dataset. Table 2 lists, for each type of dataset, its purposes, components, data collection approaches, and data sources. Throughout the test, we adopted a uniform time step Δ t of 5 min for all three types of datasets. In addition, we let the optimization horizon be 12 h (i.e., 144 time steps), which means that at each time step, 12-hours-ahead forecasts of weather and the TOU rate were required. To collect and preprocess data of different types, several Python modules were also developed. Moreover, the open-source time series database InfluxDB 2.0 [37] was used for data storage and communication, and Grafana v7.4 [38] was used for data display and user interface. 3.3 Temperature and power measurement setup Fig. 7 shows the temperature and power measurement setup at some of the test homes. Specifically, Fig. 7(a) shows a smart thermostat for tracking the indoor air temperature and communicating with the cloud-based platform, Fig. 7(b) shows a node sensor for measuring the interior wall surface temperature, and Fig. 7(c) shows a smart power meter for measuring the total energy usage of each circuit inside the electric panel. The latter makes it possible to distinguish between the energy consumed by indoor and outdoor AC units. In the home thermal model described by (1) and (2), the interior wall surface temperature is one of the two states that reflects the heat transfer between indoor and outdoor environment. Accurate measurement of such temperature\u2014which depends heavily on the sensor location\u2014is therefore important. The node sensor is preferably mounted on a wall with no direct solar, no wind, and no shading. Thus, north-facing walls were selected because solar impact from the sun was lower compared to south- and west-facing walls, and east-facing walls for some of the test homes were chosen due to their structure. The walls near a diffuser, the kitchen, and the windows were avoided to shield the sensor from unwanted disturbances. 4 Results In this section, we first present the parameter identification results for the home thermal model and the total AC power usage model, followed by a discussion of the MPC agent performance at one test home. Then, using results from multiple test homes, we assess the MPC agent\u2019s cost saving and energy flexibility. The dominant factors that impacted the MPC-based precooling test are analyzed at the end. 4.1 Parameter identification results To identify the parameters of the home thermal model, we solved the optimization problem stated in (3)\u2013(10) using measured data. To validate its accuracy, we simulated the model using a different set of measured data. Fig. 8 (a) shows the simulated (black) and measured (red) indoor air temperature in the Lab House, from which it can be seen that the model is quite accurate, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.503°F. Model validation results for other test homes can be found in Appendix A. Note that because of model simplicity, the identified parameters can be sensitive to training datasets. Moreover, although being a gray-box model it has some extrapolation capability, regular model retraining and parameter updating are still needed while the MPC agent operates. To identify the parameters of the total AC power usage model, we solved a polynomial regression problem of the form (12) using measured T o and P outdoor data. To eliminate the impact of transient AC operation, only data with sufficiently large outdoor unit power (e.g., exceeding 3.2 kW) were used. Fig. 8(b) shows the resulting polynomial (red) alongside the measured data (black). The coefficient of determination ( R 2 ) of 0.845 and root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.162 kW suggest that the polynomial fit was satisfactory. 4.2 MPC performance assessment at one test Home From July to October 2022, a set of MPC-based precooling tests were conducted at different times at the nine test homes including the Lab House. Each test lasted five to 20 days depending on the homeowner\u2019s schedule, except for the test at Home G, which was terminated prematurely at the homeowner\u2019s request. This section describes the MPC agent performance at one test home\u2014the Lab House. Fig. 9 shows seven consecutive days (from August 4 to August 10, 2022) of test results at the Lab House. Specifically, Fig. 9(a) depicts the indoor air temperature T in (blue) and interior wall surface temperature T ie (red) along with the thermal comfort range T ub and T lb (black). Fig. 9(b) displays the TOU rate and number of seconds in a 5-minute interval during which the AC was on. Fig. 9(c) shows the actual weather conditions (solar irradiation S , wind speed W , and outdoor air temperature T o ). Also shown in the figure are red-shaded areas representing the on-peak hours. Analyzing Fig. 9, several observations can be made. First, T in mostly stayed within T ub and T lb but did occasionally exceed T ub . When T in exceeded T ub , the slack variables in (11) imposed a penalty on the objective function. If this happened during the on-peak hours, the penalty might be small compared to the high electricity cost and hence might not cause the AC to turn on immediately. Second, T ie changed much more slowly compared to T in . This was because the building structure was a much larger thermal storage compared to indoor air. Such a difference also justified the use of the home thermal model. Third, the MPC agent was able to take advantage of the cooler early morning air to precool the space with higher efficiency. More importantly, unlike rule-based precooling control which has a fixed precooling schedule regardless of weather, the MPC agent was able to adapt its schedule to weather, TOU rates, etc. For example, precooling began at 4:40 am on August 4 and 5:50 am on August 10. Fourth, despite the precooling, T in often reached T ub before the on-peak hours ended, forcing the AC to be on even though that was costly. These observations show that the MPC agent behaved as intended. Finally, we remark that the reason T in reached as high as 83°F on August 10 was that the MPC agent went offline unexpectedly. The test results for other test homes, comparing the MPC-based precooling with the normal operation, are included in Appendix B. 4.3 MPC performance assessment at multiple test homes In this subsection, we assess the MPC agent\u2019s performance at multiple test homes, focusing on its cost saving and energy flexibility. To enable a fair assessment, a modified matrix profile-based weather clustering algorithm is first described. 4.3.1 Weather clustering To properly assess the benefit of MPC, two experiments have to be performed, one with MPC and one without, under the same weather conditions. Unfortunately, weather conditions are hardly ever identical across days. To address this issue, we have developed a weather clustering algorithm that combines the matrix profile-based clustering algorithms proposed in [44\u201346]. As detailed in Appendix C, this algorithm can handle long, multi-dimensional, time series data spanning four months at one sample every five minutes that contains outdoor air temperature, solar irradiation, and relative humidity measurements. The algorithm was also found to have better statistical performance than the K-means algorithm. Equipped with the so-called Snippets [46], the algorithm can handle clustering subsequences (as opposed to a single point) and can group similar weather patterns into three representative days (hot, mild, and cold summer days) for a fair MPC assessment. Fig. 10 shows the weather clustering results for Norman and Miami over the four-month test period. The bold curves show the 24-hour outdoor air temperature for the three representative days, i.e., the hot (red), mild (orange), and cold (blue) days found by Snippets. The thin curves show the outdoor air temperature for days associated with the three clusters. The gray curves represent days that were not part of any cluster, referred to as extreme days. Observe that for the data in Norman, separation between the three clusters is clear. However, separation for the data in Miami is less so, since Miami experienced a thunderstorm during the test period, causing the cold cluster to include some \u201cabnormal\u201d curves. With that said, although far apart, these abnormal curves do possess the same general shape. Finally, note that solar irradiation and relative humidity were also accounted for in the clustering process, but were omitted from Fig. 10. 4.3.2 Performance with and without MPC agent Fig. 11 displays, for each test home, the average 24-hour AC operation cost (i.e., average of C defined in (18) without (black) and with (red) the MPC agent on hot summer days. Also shown is a breakdown of each cost into off-peak hour cost (unshaded) and on-peak hour cost (shaded). Listed on the bottom of Fig. 11 are the cost saving I defined in (19) and the percentage reduction in on-peak hour cost due to using the MPC agent. Observe that the cost saving I achieved by the MPC agent ranges from 28.72 % to 51.31 %, while the percentage reduction ranges from 36.17 % to 68.44 %. These numbers suggest that the MPC agent was quite effective in shifting the load from on-peak hours to off-peak hours, which contributed to cost saving. Fig. 12 displays the results for mild summer days following the format of Fig. 11. Similar to Fig. 11, there is significant reduction in on-peak hour cost ranging from 18.67 % to 67.65 %. However, unlike Fig. 11, the cost saving I exhibits a larger variability ranging from −14.56 % to 60.32 %. The reasons for a negative cost saving (Home C downstairs)\u2014meaning MPC ended up costing more\u2014and a small but positive cost saving (Home C upstairs and Home B downstairs) are as follows. First, the baseline cost without MPC was already small, making it easy for any saving to be drowned out by disturbances such as occupant activities. In addition, for Home C, the homeowner requested a narrow thermal comfort range of only 2°F (i.e., 78\u201380°F from 9:00 pm to 6:00 am) and 3°F (i.e., 78\u201381°F for rest of day), providing limited precooling opportunities for MPC. Finally, for Home C, lowering the upper bound of the thermal comfort range from 81°F to 80°F at 9 pm made the AC work harder at night, increasing the off-peak hour cost (white space of the bar) and thus the total cost. Table 3 summarizes the performance with and without MPC on hot summer days by listing, for each test home, the average 24-hour AC operation cost, the energy consumption, the on-peak hour cost, and the percentage of time the AC was on during on-peak hours. Table 4 and Table 5 present the same information for mild and cold summer days, respectively (Table 5 contains fewer rows because fewer homeowners agreed to running tests on cold summer days). Observe that regardless of whether the summer days were hot, mild, or cold, the AC operation cost, energy consumption, on-peak hour cost, and percentage of AC run time were uniformly lower\u2014sometimes even significantly lower\u2014with MPC compared to without MPC. Indeed, there were only a handful of exceptions to this observation. These positive results demonstrate the benefits of MPC across a diverse set of homes and across different summer weather. The substantial cost saving represents an incentive for homeowners to participate in MPC-equipped DR programs. The increased participation in such programs can potentially improve load shifting, leading to a more reliable power grid (Table 6 ). 4.3.3 Impact analysis on energy flexibility In this subsection, we use the flexibility factor FF defined in (20) to evaluate the MPC agent\u2019s load shifting potential, i.e., the test homes\u2019 energy flexibility under various operation conditions when such homes participated in MPC-equipped DR programs. Fig. 13 shows, for each test home, a box plot of its flexibility factor FF when MPC was used and when the hot, mild, and cold summer days were combined. Observe that other than Home D, FF of every test home was always positive, implying that the MPC agent was effective in shifting load. However, although there was cost saving, FF of Home D was heavily skewed, attaining negative values nearly half the time. This phenomenon was due to the fact that tests on Home D were conducted on cold summer days, when there was barely any AC demand during off-peak hours while there was some AC demand during on-peak hours. Because of that, the MPC agent decided that little precooling was needed. As a result, ∫ L low P d t in (20) turned out to be smaller than ∫ L high P d t , causing FF to be negative. This suggests that on cold summer days, MPC will not be efficient in load shifting because there is little load to shift. Fig. 14 examines how the flexibility factor FF depends on certain home characteristics. Specifically, Fig. 14(a) shows box plots of FF as a function of floor area for the test homes in Norman, where only data from hot and mild summer days are considered. Notice that if we disregard the box plot for Home A, FF tends to increase as floor area increases. A possible explanation for this trend is that smaller homes generally have smaller thermal masses, which make them more susceptible to external disturbances (e.g., outside environment, occupant activities) that could rapidly heat up the indoor air during on-peak hours. Further discussion regarding floor area of test homes, their thermal characteristics, and FF can be found in Appendix D. As for why the trend is violated by Home A, a probable reason is that its AC was found to be operating below its designed capability due to an undercharge refrigerant fault, which might have crippled the MPC agent's load shifting ability. This reason is supported by Fig. 14(c), to be discussed shortly. Note that if Home A is excluded, the average FF of larger test homes\u2014those with floor areas exceeding 2000 f t 2 \u2014is 11.90 % higher than that of smaller ones. Fig. 14(b) shows box plots of FF as a function of thermal comfort range for the Lab House, where only data from mild summer days are considered. Observe that the average FF decreased by 23.33 % as the thermal comfort range shrank from 76 ° F , 82 ° F to 78 ° F , 80 ° F (same midpoint). This result makes sense because the narrower the temperature band, the more limited the precooling opportunity during off-peak hours. Thus, the more often the AC must turn on during on-peak hours, causing FF to drop and reducing energy flexibility. Also note that the average FF decreased by 20.76 % as the thermal comfort range lowered from 76 ° F , 82 ° F to 70 ° F , 76 ° F (same width). This result agrees with intuition because as cooler temperature was sought, the AC must work harder during both off- and on-peak hours. Since the latter typically consumes more energy, FF became smaller, again reducing energy flexibility. Finally, recall that a probable reason Home A had a lower-than-expected flexibility factor FF (see Fig. 14(a)) is that its AC had an undercharge refrigerant fault due possibly to leakage. To see whether this reason is plausible, we experimentally simulated the undercharge fault at the Lab House by removing 30 % of the refrigerant inside its AC. Fig. 14(c) shows the average FF when the fault was present (i.e., undercharge) and when it was absent (i.e., full charge), with all else being equal (e.g., same weather, thermal comfort range, MPC agent). From the figure, we see that such a fault can indeed reduce FF by 23.16 %, bringing down energy flexibility. 5 Conclusion In this paper, an MPC agent for optimal precooling is developed, implemented, and analyzed under different weather conditions and TOU rates. The MPC agent operates on a cloud-based platform alongside a smart thermostat and its built-in node sensor. The MPC agent is also field tested at nine residential homes over a period of four months, through which it is proved to be robust and effective. The cost saving is found to range from 28.72 % to 51.31 % on hot summer days and from −14.56 % to 60.32 % on mild summer days. The negative percentage occurred only at one of the nine homes and was due to changes in the homeowner\u2019s preferred thermal comfort range. In addition, homes with larger floor areas are found to have higher energy flexibility than smaller ones. Indeed, the flexibility factor can increase by as much as 11.90 % as floor area increases by 775 f t 2 . Energy flexibility can also be significantly affected by thermal comfort range and AC condition. In particular, increasing the midpoint temperature of a thermal comfort range by 6 °F while keeping its width fixed can increase average energy flexibility by 20.76 %. Furthermore, we saw that homeowners experiencing similar weather conditions can prefer vastly different temperature setpoints. This suggests that the role of personal thermal comfort preference may be a topic worthy of future research. Finally, we also saw that certain hard-to-detect AC faults such as low refrigerant levels can negatively impact energy flexibility. For example, in the Lab House, 30 % refrigerant leakage can lead to 23.16 % reduction in energy flexibility. This points to the importance of automated fault detection research in residential buildings. As with any field study, results reported in this paper have limitations. First, they did not cover months outside of July through October and climate regions outside of Oklahoma and Florida. Second, due to homeowner schedules and the COVID-19 pandemic, certain tests had to be postponed to cooler summer days. Third, since all the test homes other than the Lab House were occupied, the results may be affected by unreported human activities. Lastly, for simplicity in modeling, we assumed that the interior wall surface temperature changes are consistent with the entire envelope, and we only use one node sensor to measure it. In cases where unrealistic data, such as wall temperature being lower than both outdoor air and indoor air temperatures, is present, data quality checks are necessary.

Appendix A: Parameter identification results for other test homes By solving the optimization problem stated in (3)\u2013(10) using measured data from other test homes, we identified the parameters of the home thermal model for those homes. Similar to Section 4.1, we also simulated the model using additional measured data to validate its accuracy. Fig. A.1 (a)\u2013(i) shows the simulated (red) and measured (black) indoor air temperature for Home A to Home J along with the resulting mean absolute errors (MAEs). Observe that the MAEs are quite small. Appendix B: Comparison of MPC-based precooling and normal operation To better understand the differences between MPC-based precooling operation and normal operation, consider Figs. B.1\u2013B.9 which compare results from the two operations for test homes other than the Lab House. Like Fig. 9, the first subplots depict the indoor air temperature T in (blue) and interior wall surface temperature T ie (red) along with the thermal comfort range T ub and T lb (black). The second subplots display the TOU rate and number of seconds in a 5-minute interval during which the AC was on. The last subplots show the actual weather conditions (solar irradiation S , wind speed W , and outdoor air temperature T o ). Also shown in the figure are red-shaded areas representing the on-peak hours. Appendix C: Matrix profile-based weather clustering algorithm In this paper, we combine the matrix profile-based data snippets from [44,45] (for finding the most representative subsequence) with the MASS algorithm from [44,46] (for a fast pattern discovery) and introduce our own modification to group similar weather patterns into clusters. Fig. C.1 displays a flowchart that describes the modified algorithm, which contains three stages. The first stage is data processing, whereby we first query historical weather datasets from a local weather station. We then resample the data at 5-minute intervals, remove duplicate and missing data, and run different data imputations (linear or polynomial interpolation) to improve data quality. The second stage is the time series snippets stage, whereby we use the matrix profile-based data snippets in [46] to identify three representative days\u2014hot, mild, and cold days\u2014from July to October. The third stage is the clustering stage, whereby we first calculate the distance profiles of outdoor air temperature, solar irradiation, and relative humidity between each representative day and each 24-hour subsequnce. To speed up calculation, the MASS algorithm from [46] is utilized. We then calculate the normalized weighted average of the aforementioned distance profiles and find the top K days that are most similar to the representative days. The latter is accomplished by selecting the top K smallest points of the new distance profiles. In this paper, K is selected to be 30. Since outdoor air dictates the heat transfer between indoor indoor and ourdoor environment, the weights assigned to the outdoor air temerpature, solar irradiation, and relative humidity are 0.6, 0.3, and 0.1. If a data point resides in multiple clusters, it is moved to the cluster in which it has the smallest new distance profile. To evaluate the effectiveness of the matrix profile-based weather clustering algorithm, we employ both the Davies-Bouldin (DB) index [47] and Calinski-Harabasz (CH) index [48]. We also conduct a comparative assessment against the K-means algorithm, which utilizes the same data preprocessing procedure in Fig. C.2 and conducts normalization for multidimensional dataset before clustering. Due to the unsupervised nature of K-means, the cluster labels generated needs further interpretation. We categorize them into hot, mild, cold, and extreme days based on the average outdoor air temperature of each cluster. The K-means clustering results are illustrated in Fig. C.2. Generally, smaller DB and higher CH values signify a higher clustering quality. As shown in Table C. 1, the matrix profile-based weather clustering algorithm outperforms the K-means algorithm when assessing four-month weather datasets from Norman and Miami. Due to its focus on daily averages, the K-means algorithm struggles to properly cluster \u201chot extreme\u201d and \u201ccold extreme\u201d days, especially when these extremes have distinct average temperatures. In contrast, the matrix profile-based algorithm is able to deal with more diverse weather patterns in extreme clusters and thus is more effective. Appendix D: Thermal characteristics analysis for test homes We observed a relationship between floor area and flexibility factor FF in Section 4.3.3, prompting further investigation into how different building characteristics impact the flexibility factor. Although a survey has been conducted prior to the test (as shown in Table 1), the exact thermal mass of the building envelope remains unclear. In Fig. D.1 , we use τ 1 from the home thermal model as the surrogate for building envelope thermal characteristics to investigate the energy flexibility variation in different test homes. Notice that the values for τ 1 are consistent with the validation results presented in Section 4.1 and Appendix A. Fig. D.1(a) shows scatter plots of τ 1 versus floor area for the test homes. If we disregard the plot for Home A, τ 1 tends to increase as floor area increases. Fig. D.1(b) shows box plots of FF versus τ 1 . The upward trend suggests that as thermal mass increases, the energy flexibility of a building improves. While these results agree with intuition, it is important to keep in mind of other factors when assessing the energy flexibility of a home under a TOU rate.

        "dc:description": "Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based precooling strategies are typically analyzed through simulations. Their field studies in residential buildings are quite limited due to hardware retrofitting costs, lengthy parameter identification periods, and the need to have homeowners' participation. Therefore, there is a lack of MPC-based precooling impact analysis using field data which may have prevented widespread adoption of the technology. To address this issue, in this paper we developed an MPC agent and implemented it on an online cloud-based platform. The MPC agent makes use of a gray-box model to capture the home thermal dynamics, a novel set of constraints to ensure that the model parameters identified are realistic, and a node sensor to provide interior wall surface temperature measurement. To evaluate its performance and conduct impact analysis, we introduced a modified matrix profile-based weather clustering algorithm and two performance indicators for cost saving and energy flexibility. We also carried out extensive field tests on nine homes over a period of four months. Our results show that the MPC agent can reduce energy cost by 28.72%\u201351.31% on hot summer days and by up to 60.32% on mild summer days, in addition to achieving significant energy flexibility. Moreover, the agent's performance is found to be most impacted by weather conditions, AC performance, user comfort preferences, and floor areas of the homes.",
