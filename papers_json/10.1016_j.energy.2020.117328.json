A data-driven energy-saving control strategy applied to balance the multi-zone demand controlled ventilation system is presented. The proposed strategy consists of two steps: system model construction and air balancing control. Based on observed datasets, a multi-layer perceptron structure is employed to model the multi-zone ventilation system. The model is used to predict the pressure differences of each damper based on the static pressure of the main duct and the desired airflow rates of each damper. Air balancing control approach is implemented based on the empirical formula of the damper. This approach is use to predict the operating positions of each damper based on the predicted pressure differences of the developed model. An experimental apparatus consisting of original components of ventilation system is set up to collect the training and testing data, and simultaneously used to validate the performance of the proposed control strategy. Experimental results demonstrate that the issue of over-ventilation and under-ventilation of demand controlled ventilation system is eliminated, and energy savings of fan power can be obtained with the proposed control strategy.

A small increase in system operating efficiency can result in substantial energy savings [7]. Therefore, promoting energy efficiency of HVAC systems is essential. Demand controlled ventilation (DCV) is one of the strategies that could offer a great opportunity to reduce energy consumption in HVAC systems. Luigi et al. [8] assessed the annual performance of a CO2-based DCV system compared with the case of constant airflow rate system in a university library established in an ancient building in Venice. The results demonstrated that the CO2-based DCV decreased the total primary energy consumption of air handling unit by 33%. Bart et al. [9] selected five rooms with large and varying occupancy profiles in four different school and office buildings in Belgium to assess the energy efficiency of DCV systems in a moderate climate. Results of the case studies showed that the energy consumption for the fans decreased by 50\u201355% and ventilation heat losses decreased by 34\u201347%. Through a variable frequency drive in one study [10], two static pressure reset strategies were used to modulate the airflow rate of supply air. The performance of two strategies were compared with constant static pressure set point strategy. Experiments results approved that up to 60% of system input power savings can be obtained. In DCV systems serving multiple zones, however, the over-ventilation issue may be serious because the required airflow fraction of critical zone differs significantly from the total airflow fraction, and results in the energy waste [11\u201313]. For addressing this issue, optimal control strategies are applied to maintain the acceptable thermal comfort and indoor air quality of each zone with minimized energy consumption. Mossolly et al. [14] explored the effect of optimized control strategies on energy consumption in an existing typical air conditioning system in Beirut. The cost function is formulated based on the cost of energy consumption and constrained by system and thermal space transient models. Genetic algorithm was used to solve the optimization problem. Results demonstrated that energy savings up to 30.4% can be achieved. Zeng et al. [15] constructed a predictive model of the HVAC energy consumption and the environment conditions of multiple zones using data mining algorithms. The firefly algorithm was utilized to solve the predictive models. The results indicated that over 17% of energy saving can be obtained in the least restrictive environment condition constraint. Kim et al. [16] constructed an integrated meta-model for a daylight, heating, ventilating and air conditioning system to predict building energy performance. Genetic algorithm was applied to solve the system optimization model. Results demonstrated that an average 13.7% lower total energy consumption can be achieved against the conventional model. However, the optimization algorithm is hard to find the globally optimal solution. The optimal control strategy is far more optimal in terms of energy saving, therefore, there is still energy saving potential in multi-zone DCV systems given that over-ventilation could be completely resolved. Jing et al. [17] proposed an air balancing strategy to eliminate the over-ventilation and under-ventilation issue for multi-zone DCV system. In this strategy, a physical mathematical model of the ventilation system was constructed based on the steady-state pressure balance, and the Bayesian linear regression supervised machine learning algorithm was used to estimate the unknown parameters of the model. Results demonstrated that a maximum value 14.3% of fan power reduction can be achieved compared to conventional strategy without air balancing. Sharing the same mathematical model, an optimal static pressure set-point selection method was developed to calculate the minimum closed-form static pressure necessary to guarantee the system consumes the least energy. Results showed that the proposed strategy can achieve an average energy saving of 21.4% compared to the conventional strategy with constant static pressure set-point [18]. Using the objective function based on L1-norm to characterize the relationship between the flow rate and pressure drop, Cheng et al. [19] improved the robustness of air balancing under noise environment. Results demonstrated that the robust method is suppressed to the sensor noise, and provided the possibility to obtain an accurate air balancing result when sensor accuracy cannot be guaranteed. It is very difficult to develop precise models of each subsystem using physical-based modeling methods, and a significant effort is required for a detailed understanding of system physics. On top of that, a large number of parameters of these models need to be either extracted from the manufacture supplied data or estimated using the parameter estimation techniques. Detailed physical-based models often involve high computational cost and excessive memory demand due to their complexity, which makes them difficult to apply in practice. When models for a variety of ventilation system configurations need to be developed and tuned, these limitations become very evident, and imped the deployment of such methods in real world. A simpler alternative to physical-based modeling methods is data-driven method that does not require the understanding of system physics. Some studies have demonstrated that the data-driven models can offer lightly higher accuracy than the physical-based models in the prediction of building energy consumption [20\u201323]. Therefore, it is necessary to discover an effective data-driven air balancing strategy for DCV systems readily implemented in practice. In this paper, a data-driven air balancing control strategy for DCV system is presented. The contribution of this paper is of four-folds: 1) the energy saving strategy is divided into system model construction and air balancing control; 2) a data-driven framework of modeling multi-zone demand controlled ventilation system is proposed; 3) the operating positions of each damper are resolved with empirical formula of damper; 4) the effectiveness of the proposed data-driven approach for saving energy of a multi-zone demand controlled ventilation system is validated through an experimental apparatus. The reminder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the overview of the energy-saving control strategy is presented. In Section 3, the data-driven model of the ventilation system is presented. In Section 4, the air balancing control method is presented, while in Section 5, the experimental tests are carried out to verify the performance of the proposed strategy. Finally, this paper is summarized in Section 6. 2 Overview of the energy saving control strategy The control strategy improves the energy efficiency of DCV system by implementing air balance of ventilation system. This strategy consists of two steps: system model construction and air balancing control. Fig. 1 shows the overview schematic of the strategy with a typical simplified DCV system having one supply duct and four zones, in which the blue dashed line indicates the related components of model construction, and the red dotted line indicates the related components of air balancing control. The blue line and blue rectangle indicate the energy saving model, and the red line and red rectangle indicate the air balancing control. System model construction is to map the relationship between the static pressure set-point and pressure differences of each damper, as depicted with the red dotted line in Fig. 1. The constructed model aims at predicting the damper pressure differences according to the static pressure set-point and the desired airflow rates of each zone. The construction procedure of system model is presented in detail in Section 3. Air balancing control is to determine the operation positions of each zone damper to realize the air balance for all zones, as depicted with the blue dashed line in Fig. 1. The air balancing control aims at providing the desired airflow rate of each zone with minimum total airflow rate. The details of air balancing control are presented in Section 4. 3 Energy saving model of ventilation system 3.1 Experimental apparatus and data collection 3.1.1 Experimental apparatus Experimental mechanism in this study is set up with original components of a commonly used ventilation system in buildings. The experimental apparatus is mainly composed of two parts, i.e., static pressure control zone and air balancing control zone. Fig. 2 is the photo of the experimental apparatus, and schematic diagram of the experimental platform is shown in Fig. 3 . The static pressure control zone is used to maintain the constant static pressure set-point of the main duct under dynamic working load. This zone consists of a fan, a PI controller and a pressure sensor. The fan is a variable-speed centrifugal supply fan with backward curved blades, and its speed is controlled by direct DC voltage over the rage of [0\u201310 V] provide by the controller. The PI controller is used to modulate the fan speed using the measured duct static pressure (pressure sensor presented through blue dot in the figure) to keep the duct static pressure at specific set-point. The pressure sensor is used to measure the static-pressure of the main duct and connected to the PI controller to maintain the static-pressure at the desired set-point. The air balancing control zone consist of 23 components: three elbows, seven straight ducts, four tees, two transitions, five smart dampers and five terminals. These components are the main components and extensively used in practice and their size are shown on the right of Fig. 3. The experimental ventilation system is fully instrumented. Smart dampers mounted in the air ducting system, shown in Fig. 4 , are used for measuring the pressure difference and airflow rate of the damper [24,25]. Two pressures sensors are installed in the smart damper. One sensor with measuring range ±250Pa is used to measure the static pressure of the main duct. The other one is used to measure the pressure difference which is used to calculate the airflow rate through the damper. The calculation model of the airflow rate is shown in Eq. (1). The smart damper is calibrated with the orifice flow meter YPLGK-65, and validated under various Reynold numbers varying from 6.38 × 103 to 19.1 × 103 with RMSE <0.2. The details of the smart damper is presented in study [24]. (1) Δ P 1 2 ρ ( q / A ) 2 = 0.1656 1 + e − 0.2988 × ( θ − 16.88 ) + p 0 ∗ ( Re ) where Δ P is the pressure difference of the damper, ρ is the air density, q is the airflow rate through the damper, A is the pipe cross-sectional area, p 0 ∗ ( Re ) is an empirical function or interpolation table provided by the manufacturer. Power consumption of the fan is measured by a power meter with accuracy of ±0.1%. 3.1.2 Data collection In this study, two datasets are collected from the experimental apparatus for training and testing of the energy saving model. The testing dataset is the unseen data from new runs of the experimental apparatus. For the purpose of the efficient multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model training, experimental data that contains sufficient information regarding the system behavior over the entire operation range is necessary. Therefore, several representative damper positions are chosen to cover the entire operation range based on the resistance characteristic curve of the damper, shown in Fig. 5 , in the data collection of training and testing. ● Training dataset collection: Four damper positions are chosen, namely 15°, 30°, 45° and 60°, representing one position of dead zone ([0° ∼ 20°]) and three positions of linear zone ([20° ∼ 60°]). In total, there are 1024 (45, five dampers) sets of measure data collected with the different combinations of four positions. ● Testing data collection: Three damper positions are chosen, namely 10°, 30° and 50°, representing one position of dead zone ([0° ∼ 20°]) and two positions of linear zone ([20° ∼ 60°]). In total, there 243 (35, five dampers) sets of measure data collected with the different combinations of three positions. Before triggering the data acquisition (DAQ) system, the experimental apparatus is to be stabilized for 10 min. Because of the existence of system and sensor errors, some abnormal data exist and will affect the accuracy of the experiment, the collected datasets will be processed. After pre-processing of the training and testing dataset, there are 1009 and 241 valid datasets respectively. The overall data sampling procedures of training data are summarized in Algorithm 1. The datasets utilized in training and testing process is summarized in Table 1 . Algorithm 1 Data collection pseudo-codes.

Apparently, it is a typical non-linear system. Therefore, the pressure difference at the damper is the function of static pressure of the main duct and the airflow rates of each damper, and the system model can be rewritten as: (3) Δ p = f ( P s p , q ) where Δ p = [ Δ p 1 , Δ p 2 , ⋯ , Δ p m ] T , q = [ q 1 , q 2 , ⋯ , q m ] T , m is the number of terminals, f ( ⋅ ) is an unknown non-linear function indicates the relationship between the pressure and airflow rates of each damper. The objective of this section is to design the data driven non-linear function f ( ⋅ ) to predict the pressure differences of each damper according to the static pressure of the main duct and the airflow rates of each damper. In this study, multi-layer feed forward network (MLFFN) [29,30] is adopted to construct the non-linear function. MLFFN is constructed using several layers of interconnected neurons having one or more hidden layers and the nodes are connected in a feed-forward manner between the input and the output layer. As depicted in Fig. 6 , the network considered in this study consists of an input layer, an output layer and a hidden layer. The static pressure of the main duct and the airflow rates of each damper are considered as the inputs, and the pressure differences of each damper are considered as the outputs of the developed MLFFN model (see Fig. 7). The predicted outputs of the constructed MLFFN based model can be expressed as: (4) Δ P = f 2 ( ∑ j = 1 M ω k j ( 2 ) f 1 ( ∑ i = 1 N ω j i ( 1 ) q i + ω j 0 ( 1 ) ) + ω k 0 ( 2 ) ) where vector Δ P denotes the pressure difference of each damper, f 1 ( ⋅ ) and f 2 ( ⋅ ) represent the activation functions of the hidden and output layers, q i denotes the desired airflow rate of each terminal, ω denotes the weights between nodes, N is the number of the output variables, M is the number of the neurons of hidden layer, the superscript (1) indicates that the corresponding parameters are in the input layer of the network, and the superscript (2) indicates that the corresponding parameters are in the hidden layer of the network. In this study, the linear function is used as the activation function of the output layer while the hyperbolic tangent sigmoid (tagsig) function is used as the activation function of hidden layer, as below: (5) f 1 ( n ) = t a g s i g ( n ) = 2 1 + e − 2 n − 1 In this work, the developed MLFFN based model is trained using a standard back propagation training method via Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm. This training algorithm is more efficient compared to other types of available gradient based training methods [31]. From Eqs. (3) and (4), it can be seen the constructed pressure predictive model f ( ⋅ ) is the combination of activation functions of the hidden and output layers as below: (6) f ( ⋅ ) = f 2 ( f 1 ( ⋅ ) ) 3.3 Energy saving model validation To evaluate the performance of constructed model, a regression analysis between the network outputs and the experimental data is utilized [32\u201334]. The evaluation function is represented as follows: (7) e r r i n d e x = w t r a i n ⋅ M A P E t r a i n + w t e s t ⋅ M A P E t e s t M A P E t r a i n = M A P E t r a i n = 1 n ∑ i = 1 n | p ˜ i − p i | p i where MAPE train is the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) computed based on the training dataset, MAPE test is the MAPE obtained based on the testing dataset, w t r a i n and w t e s t are the weighting parameters for the respective MAPE, p ˜ i is the predicted value of pressure, and p i is the observed value of pressure. The lower the prediction error index e r r i n d e x , the better the prediction capacity of the model is. Training error is taken into account in the fitness function, as it relates to how well the neural networks have learned and memorized the training data. Testing error represents how well the MLFFNs generalize. In this study, both w t r a i n and w t e s t are weighted equally set at 0.5. Utilizing the training and testing datasets in Table 1, the number of neurons in the hidden layer is determined (a 5-15-5 structure is employed by trial and error), and the developed MLFFN model is trained. Table 2 illustrates the results of performance comparison between the proposed model and the physical-based model proposed by Jing et al. [26], named SVM (Support Vector Machine) model, in which SVM supervised machine learning is used to identify the unknown parameters. As can be seen, the MLFFN model has a higher accuracy than the physical-based model. 3.4 Analysis of energy saving ways A mathematical analysis of the energy saving potential of the constructed model is provided in this section. In general, the demanded power [35,36] of the fan can be described by: (8) P f a n = P f a n ⋅ q η where P f a n is the demanded fan power, P f a n is the fan pressure, q is the airflow rate of the fan, η is the fan efficiency. In a DCV system, the fan pressure is a constant depending on the static pressure set-point. In Fig. 1, for example, the pressure can be calculated as follows: (9) P f a n = P s t + △ P d u c t where △ P d u c t is the pressure loss of the straight duct, and it can be calculated according to Eq. (2). According to Eqs. (2), (8) and (9), the demanded power of the fan can be rewritten as: (10) P f a n = α q + β q 3 where. The meanings of the symbols in Eq. (10) is the same as those in Eqs. (2), (8) and (9). In a more complex DCV system, the demanded power is similar to the format of Eq. (10). Assuming that the fan efficiency, η is approximately the same regardless of variation of the load, the way to influence the power consumption is to minimize the airflow rate. Therefore, the fan will save power consumption provided that the DCV system achieving air balance because the balanced system provides the thermal comfort with the minimized airflow rate. The energy saving way can be interpreted through the characteristic curve of the fan, as shown in Fig. 8 . As can be seen, the controller reduces fan speed from n 1 to n 2 as the total airflow rate decreases (i.e. from point W to X). Meanwhile, the power consumption is proportional to the cube of the rotational speed as follows: (11) P f a n = ( n n 0 ) 3 P f a n 0 where n is the rotational speed, n 0 is the initial rotational speed, P f a n 0 is the initial mechanical power. Hence, the fan will consume less energy because of the drop of the rotational speed. Although energy consumption of the fan is not directly calculated, it can be seen that reducing the quantity of airflow rate implies a reduction in energy use. Consequently, the constructed model is an energy-saving model. 4 Air balancing control The air balancing control is expected to be able to achieve the balance for all zones by modulating the damper operating position. The empirical formula based on the experimental results of the damper is used to design the air balancing control method. In this study, the adopted empirical formula has been summarized in American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) duct fitting database (DFDB) [37,38] as follows: (12) Δ P = 1 2 C f ρ V 2 where Δ P is the pressure difference of the damper, ρ is the air density, and V is the average velocity in the duct, which is proportional to airflow rate: (13) q = π ( D 2 ) 2 V C f is the local friction coefficient of damper and obtained from experiments. For example, C f of butterfly damper in round conduit is tabulated in Table 3 , and the data in the table comes from the handbook of hydraulic resistance [39]. The procedure of the air balancing control is demonstrated in Fig. 9 . The inputs are the pressure differences of each damper, predicted outputs by the energy saving model, and the outputs are the operating angels of each damper. The development of air balancing control is accomplished in the following three steps: \u2022 Predicting the pressure differences of each damper according to the static pressure of the main duct and the desired airflow rates of each zones; \u2022 Calculating the local friction coefficient C f of the damper according to Eqs. (12) and (13); \u2022 Determining the damper positon through the reference table, according to the value obtained for C f . 5 Experimental validation After developing the MLFFN based air balancing control strategy for the ventilations system as reported above, some tests are carried out using the experimental apparatus described in Section 3.1 to validate the performance and energy-saving potential. In the following tests, the static pressure of the experimental apparatus is preset to a constant value (36 Pa). 5.1 Command following test This test is to show the performance of the proposed control strategy modulating the damper positons to achieve the air balance. In this test, 32 sets of desired airflow rates are predefined to test the performance of command following of the proposed control strategy. They are selected as follows: ● First, 32 sets operating positions, each set including positions of five dampers, are selected. The position of each damper covers the dead zone ([0°, 20°]) and the linear zone ([20°, 60°]), but not cover the dead zone ([60°, 90°]) because the airflow rate is near zero in dead zone. ● Then, the experimental apparatus runs according to the predefined 32 sets of operating positions sequentially. When the testbed settles down at the predefined position of each set, the measured airflow rate is recorded and used as the desired airflow rates of command following test. After selecting the desired airflow rates, the proposed control strategy is used to determine the positions of each damper. The experimental apparatus modulates all dampers to their determined positon, and records the measured airflow rate. Using the recorded measurements, the performance of the propose control strategy is evaluated using the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and standard deviation of absolute percentage error (StdAPE) as follows [30,40,41]: (14) A P E = | q ˆ − q q ˆ | × 100 (15) M A P E = 1 n ∑ i = 1 n A P E i (16) S t d A P E = 1 n − 1 ∑ i = 1 n ( A P E i − M A P E ) 2 where q is the measured airflow rate through the damper, and q ˆ is the desired airflow rate through the damper, n is the number of experiments. In this test, the command following test is repeated 5 times. Fig. 9 illustrates the test results, in which the blue line represents the desired airflow rate, the red line represents the mean measured airflow rate, the green line represents the MAPE, and the pink line represents the StdAPE, and Table 3 summarizes the results for three representative datasets (No. 5, 10 and 20). As can be seen, the results of Fig. 10 and Table 4 demonstrate that the proposed control strategy successfully reduces the APE to 8.6%, which satisfies the ASHRAE\u2019s standard (10%). It proves that the proposed control strategy can provide a well-balanced ventilation system under dynamic working conditions, and also proves that the constructed the data-driven model, MLFFN model, is sufficient in modeling the ventilation system. 5.2 Energy saving potential The objective of this section is to show the energy saving potential of the proposed control strategy by trending a measured variables: fan power, providing useful information in regard to on-going energy savings. In this test, comparison will be made between conventional DCV without air balancing strategy and the proposed DCV strategy with air balancing control strategy. The conventional DCV control strategy without air balancing is used a reference. The procedure of the test is as follows: \u2022 All dampers are initially modulated to position 40°. The captured airflow rate (25.5 l/s) of the first path is set as the desired airflow rate of the first path, and the other four dampers are used to regulate their position to change the total load of the system. \u2022 The air balancing control strategy is used to determine the position of first damper to maintain the desired airflow rate 25.5 l/s. After the system settles down, the airflow rate of the first damper and the fan power are measured and recorded. In total, there are 22 sets of measure data collected. Fig. 11 illustrates the comparison results of the airflow rate under two control strategies. It can be observed that the airflow rate decreases with the decrease of the load, and the zone is over-ventilated when the airflow rate is larger than the desired airflow rate (25.5 l/s) and under-ventilated when the airflow rate is smaller than the desired airflow rate with conventional DCV strategy. Whereas, the airflow rate is approximately maintained at the desired airflow rate (25.5 l/s) using the proposed control strategy with air balancing. The results demonstrate that the proposed DCV strategy with air balancing can eliminate the over-ventilation and under-ventilation existed in the conventional DCV control strategy without air balancing. Fig. 12 illustrates the power consumption of the fan under two control strategies. The results show that the proposed DCV strategy with air balancing consumes less energy than the conventional DCV strategy without air balancing, and achieving a maximum value 12.5% of the energy saving. 6 Conclusion This research presented a data-driven energy-saving control strategy for multi-zone demand controlled ventilation system. The strategy consists of two steps: system model construction and air balancing control. The system model was constructed with MLFFN structure using the observed datasets. The static pressure of main duct and the desired airflow rates of each damper are considered as the input variables, and the pressure differences of each damper are considered as the output variables of the model. The air balancing control was implemented based on the empirical formula of damper. The outputs of the system model, the pressure differences of each damper, are used as the input variables, and the operating positions of each damper are considered as the output variables. An experimental apparatus with five terminals was set up to collect the training and testing data, used for training the developed MLFFN based model, and also was used to validate the performance of the proposed control strategy. Some tests were conducted to verify the performance and energy-saving potential. The results of command following tests indicated that the proposed strategy can resolve the issue of over-ventilation and under-ventilation of demand controlled ventilation system. Some tests were carried out to validate the energy-saving potential compared to conventional DCV system without air balancing control strategy. The results demonstrated that the desired airflow rates can be controlled within 8.9% absolute percentage error, and the reduction for fan power can achieve a maximum value 12.5%. The proposed control strategy involves the following advantages: \u2022 It establishes a data-driven model of the ventilation system based on the multi-layer perceptron structure; \u2022 It implements the air balancing control using the empirical formula of damper; \u2022 It eliminates the issue of over-ventilation and under-ventilation of multi-zone demand controlled ventilation system. The data-driven models are data dependent, and needed to be retrained for different datasets under different environments. However, the advantage of the data-driven models lies on its superior power of learning the underlying patterns of complex systems, provided sufficiently large datasets. Therefore, future research will focus on the real-time online implementation of energy-saving data-driven control strategy in practice.
