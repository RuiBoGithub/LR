University of Toronto Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering 35 St. George St. Toronto ON M5S 1A4 Canada As the proportion of the population who resides in urban centers grows, the number of dwellings in high-rise residential buildings is also increasing. In Canada, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) typically accounts for over half of all energy use in this building type and, as such, consideration of these loads is key to effective energy demand-side management. Smart thermostats present a new opportunity conserve energy and shift electricity load to off-peak periods in these buildings through modifications to HVAC control strategies. In this study, three thermostat control strategies were tested in 49 suites across two contemporary high-rise residential buildings: 1) baseline operation (thermostat operating as a standard programmable thermostat); 2) occupancy-based control (thermostat operating using an occupancy-reactive control strategy); 3) load shifting control (thermostat operating using a pre-conditioning strategy). HVAC runtime data was collected from smart thermostats installed in the suites and was used to develop data-driven regression models to estimate baseline suite HVAC runtime based on weather conditions and suite characteristics. Thermostat-measured HVAC runtime data for periods in which occupancy-based or load shifting control strategies were in use in the suite was then compared with estimated baseline runtime for similar outdoor conditions. Occupancy-based control was found to reduce HVAC system runtime during the cooling seasonby 5.9% ± 46% on average. On aggregate, the load shifting control strategy was not effective at reducing peak period HVAC load during the cooling season. The strategy was able to reduce peak period loads in a subset of suites substantially, which may be leveraged to reduce electricity demand during capacity-constrained periods of grid operation, however, based on marginal emissions factors for Ontario\u2019s electricity grid, even in these suites, the strategy was not effective in reducing GHG emissions overall. Keywords Demand management Energy flexibility HVAC Buildings Residential Connected Thermostats 1 Introduction In 2018, 55% of the global population lived in urban regions, with this proportion expected to grow to 68% by the year 2050 [1]. The resulting increase in energy use drives resource consumption, increases greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and places strain on energy infrastructure. Due to electricity storage limitations, electricity infrastructure is particularly sensitive to this growth in population. To combat the increases in transmission and generation capacity needs, effective demand-side management is required, which can be achieved using a variety of measures, including conservation and load shifting. In addition to managing transmission and generation capacities, in regional electricity grids with GHG emissions intensities which vary based on the time of day, shifting electricity demand away from on-peak periods may result in a net decrease in GHG emissions even if it results in a substantial increase in total energy use. The electricity grid in Ontario, Canada, where the study was conducted, is one example of this type of grid: Average hourly GHG intensities associated with electricity production during on-peak periods (generally considered to be between 11:00 and 17:00 in Ontario) are almost four times higher than typical GHG intensities overnight (13 g CO2eq/kWh) [2] in the region. Another consequence of population growth in urban regions, is an increase in the proportion of dwellings in high-rise residential buildings. In Canada, for example, construction of dwellings in high-rise residential buildings outpaced the construction of dwellings in all other building types in 2018, accounting for 53% of all new dwelling construction starts [3]. Heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) typically accounts for 50% of all energy use in high-rise residential buildings in Canada [4] and managing and reducing energy used by HVAC systems is one way to reduce the growing strain placed on energy infrastructure systems. Newly constructed Canadian high-rise residential buildings typically include non-programmable thermostats in each suite. As many of these buildings are constructed by developers with suites then sold to individual owners, we assume this thermostat selection is dictated by lowest initial cost. In the rare case that programmable thermostats are installed in suites, residents frequently do not program them or fail to take full advantage of energy-saving opportunities [5]. Connected, smart thermostats, which typically integrate occupant sensing technology and Wi-Fi connectivity, can be used to conserve energy and reduce the need for occupants to program and update thermostat schedules through the use of temperature set-backs when occupant presence is not detected. Furthermore, smart thermostats also present an opportunity to optimize space conditioning load profiles through the use of load shifting control strategies which can be deployed remotely over the thermostat\u2019s Wi-Fi connection 2 Background Previous studies on occupancy-reactive temperature control and load shifting through thermal mass activation were reviewed in order to understand the state-of-the-art in the high-rise residential building sector. 2.1 Occupancy-reactive temperature control Occupancy-reactive temperature control is a common feature in commercially-available smart thermostats which use presence sensors to detect when a zone is occupied and applies a temperature set-back when unoccupied. The efficacy of occupancy-reactive thermostat control has been previously demonstrated in single-family homes. Field studies in the U.S. have found average heating and cooling load energy savings ranging from 6% to 14% [6\u201310], although these savings have been shown to differ slightly between smart thermostat makes and models [7,8]. Despite the promise demonstrated in single-family homes, limited work has been completed in a high-rise residential setting with typical apartment or condominium building occupants. A 2016 study by Pritoni, Woolley, and Modera examined the effect of smart thermostats on energy use in university residence halls [11]. However, as university students and typical condominium or apartment residents likely have significantly different behaviours and expectations as occupants, the results of this study may not be applicable in high-rise residential buildings. Previous work on thermostat programming behaviours and occupancy-patterns in contemporary high-rise residential buildings showed promise for the efficacy of occupancy-based control in these suites [12], however changes in terminal HVAC unit operation were not quantified. 2.2 Load shifting using thermal mass activation Surface activation of building thermal mass is one strategy to reduce HVAC energy consumption during periods of peak electric grid demand by shifting these loads to off-peak periods. This load shift is accomplished through temperature set-backs (temperature reductions during the cooling season and increases during the heating season) prior to peak periods. These set-backs pre-condition building structural mass via conditioned indoor air provided through the forced-air HVAC supply system. The temperature change in the structural mass from over-conditioning during off-peak periods is used to \u201cstore\u201d cooling or heating energy for use during on-peak periods when the thermal mass is discharged to the indoor air, providing passive space conditioning. This pre-cooling approach has been widely studied in commercial and office buildings using surface activation of thermal mass [13\u201324]. These studies have found peak period electricity load reductions ranging from 0 to 100% reduction with an average peak load reduction of around 30%. A wide range of set-back depths (1 °C to 11 °C, average 3.7 °C) and set-back durations (2 h to 12 h, average 9 h) were used in the studies, although the load reduction performance did not consistently track with set-back depth or duration. Likely, differences in internal building structure, finishes, and building envelopes greatly impact the performance of the pre-cooling, along with the baseline building operating conditions. Investigation of pre-conditioning strategies in residential settings, however, has been limited with no high-rise residential building-based studies and only one simulation study in single-family homes. Turner, Walker, and Roux simulated the use of pre-cooling in a high-performance single-family home for 12 U.S. climate zones, using surface activation of thermal mass through a forced-air system [25]. A range of pre-cooling strategies were tested with a set-back depth of either 3.4 °C or 4.4 °C and set-back durations of 3, 5, and 8 h. Peak period loads were reduced by 50% to 75% and a set-back depth of 3.4 °C combined with a set-back duration of 8 h was found to be the most effective. It is difficult to assess whether the findings of this study may apply in high-rise residential buildings: while high-rise residential building occupants likely have similar comfort expectations and temperature schedules to occupants of single-family homes, the higher mass associated with high-rise residential buildings will likely impact pre-cooling effects and control strategy performance. While past literature has investigated the impacts of alternative thermostat control strategies in commercial buildings and single-family homes, the efficacy of these strategies has not yet been investigated in high-rise residential buildings, which differ substantially in terms of HVAC system configuration, thermal mass, and occupant schedules. This study is the first to investigate the impacts of occupancy-reactive control and load shifting in high-rise residential buildings. Smart thermostat data, collected over a one-year period in 49 suites, were used to assess the change in suite-based HVAC unit runtime resulting from the use of occupancy-reactive control and a novel loading-shifting control strategy during the cooling season in southern Ontario, Canada. 3 Methodology In this section, the studied buildings, participant recruitment methods, data collection methods, tested thermostat control strategies, and analysis methods are outlined. 3.1 Study buildings and participant recruitment Two contemporary, highly glazed high-rise residential buildings in downtown Toronto, Canada, were recruited for the study. The facades of the study buildings are shown in Fig. 1 and key characteristics of the studied buildings are outlined in Table 1 . In both buildings, occupants control their suite temperature setpoint through a thermostat which controls the in-suite terminal HVAC unit (fan coil in Building A or heat pump in Building B). A pressurized corridor ventilation system provides additional suite space conditioning through heated or cooled hallway air that, in theory, is forced into suites through door undercuts. Windows in both buildings are operable, however, due to building code restrictions, the opening area of windows is limited to 100 mm (4 in.) in diameter. Three main types of suite layouts exist in the two buildings: Layout 1 (one bedroom apartment, n = 14), Layout 2 (one bedroom apartment with set-back bedroom, n = 9), and Layout 3 (two- or three- bedroom corner suite, n = 16). Characteristic suite floor plans for each layout type are presented in Fig. 2 . Residents of the buildings were informed of the study by their condominium boards and given the option to opt-in. Participants were required to allow researchers to install an ecobee3 smart thermostat in their suites, remotely collect data, and change thermostat control strategies over the one and a half year monitoring period which commenced in February 2018 and ended in August 2019. Residents who owned their suite were compensated for their time through the retention of the thermostat after study completion and residents who were renters received a total of $50 CAD in gift cards for participation. This study was approved by the University of Toronto Research Ethics Board (protocol number 38815). Annual weather in Toronto, Canada can be largely grouped into three categories: heating season (typically October though March), cooling season (June through August), and shoulder season (September, April, and May), during which space conditioning demand is inconsistent and may comprise both heating and cooling loads (which building HVAC equipment may or may not be configured to provide). Toronto\u2019s climate is generally heating-dominated, however, cooling loads are not insignificant - for the one-year period beginning August 1st, 2018, Toronto had 3707 heating degree days and 470 cooling degree days (°C·d, base temperature of 18 °C) [26]. For the purpose of this analysis, only the cooling season is considered, as heating and shoulder season in-suite HVAC loads are relatively low due to excessive conditioning of building common areas in the heating season and the mild weather conditions during the shoulder season (see Fig. 3 b for heating season). 3.2 Data collection HVAC unit runtime data for the study (measured from the time the thermostat signaled the HVAC system to turn on until the time the thermostat signaled the HVAC system to turn off) were collected remotely from smart thermostats installed in participants\u2019 suites. Previous work has shown that, on an hourly basis, thermostat-signaled runtime is well correlated with actual FCU runtimes in Building A, however, the relationship between thermostat-signaled runtime in Building B has not been investigated [27]. Thermostat data from 54 suites were collected between June 2018 and August 2019 at five-minute intervals, however thermostat data were missing for short periods of time during the study due to intermittent connectivity issues and, in some cases, for longer periods of time in certain suites due to longer-term connectivity issues. Additionally, two participants left the study after selling their suite and data were no longer collected after they moved out. Ultimately, data were available for analysis from 49 suites during the cooling season. Historical weather data (outdoor air temperature and cloud cover) were collected at a government weather station in Toronto and daily solar irradiance data from NASA\u2019s Prediction of Worldwide Energy Resources (POWER) databases were downloaded for the period between June 2018 to August 2019 [26,28]. Data were aggregated or disaggregated to hourly intervals for the runtime comparison. Collected data measurement errors, intervals, aggregation methods, and sources are summarized in Table 2 . In addition to the collected thermostat and weather data, the solar azimuth angle corresponding to each thermostat data reading was calculated at five-minute intervals using the SolarPy package [30] and aggregated to hourly intervals by taking the average across the five-minute data. Dummy variables were created to indicate if each observation occurred during the cooling, heating, or shoulder seasons. The value of the dummy variable was based on typical trends of high and moderate heating and cooling demand in southern Ontario, Canada and central building system heating/cooling changeover dates. Specifically, an observation was deemed to take place in the cooling season if it occurred between June 1 and September 30, in the heating season if it occurred between November 1 and February 28, and in the shoulder season if it occurred in any other month. Additionally, suite characteristic data were collected from building floors plans. These data are summarized in Table 3 . All data were linearly scaled such that all model inputs were between 0 and 1. 3.3 Tested control strategies Thermostat data were collected under three scenarios to establish HVAC runtime profiles for each suite during: 1) baseline conditions (thermostat operating as a standard programmable thermostat); 2) occupancy-based control conditions (thermostat operating using an occupancy-reactive control strategy); 3) load shifting control conditions (thermostat operating using a pre-conditioning strategy). 3.3.1 Baseline conditions In the baseline scenario, all thermostat smart features were turned off and it was operated as a standard-programmable thermostat. Temperature setpoints were controlled by participants\u2019 set daily schedule (if any) or as a constant temperature (if participants had not set a schedule). 3.3.2 Occupancy-Based control In the occupancy-based control scenario, the smart thermostat \u201cAuto-Away\u201d feature was turned on. This meant that the temperature set-points would follow the participant\u2019s set daily schedule, when occupancy was detected. However, when occupancy was not detected for two hours during a scheduled home period, an away temperature set-back was applied in the suite, the depth of which was chosen by the suite occupant. The average temperature set-back depth was + 2.9 °C in the cooling season. If occupancy was detected during an auto-away period, the thermostat reverted to the participant\u2019s set schedule. 3.3.3 Load shifting control In the load shifting control scenario, default set-points changes were set by the researchers for the overnight period during the cooling season (pre-cooling) as detailed in Table 4 . Participants did not have the option to change the depth of the pre-conditioning set-back but could cancel the hourly scheduled temperature changes all-together and revert to their originally scheduled temperature set-point at any time (\u201cstrategy override\u201d). The aim of load shifting control was to reduce HVAC load between 11:00 and 17:00. The depth and length of these temperature setbacks were determined through the use of a simple spreadsheet model of the thermal mass of a representative suite layout. For simplicity, the model considered only the concrete mass in the suite (i.e., concrete sheer walls, floor, and ceiling slabs) as the thermal storage potential of other materials in the suite is comparatively negligible. A description of this model is included in the Supplemental Information (SI) document. 3.4 Analysis procedure Changes in suite-based HVAC runtime resulting from the use of occupancy-based thermostat control and load shifting control were evaluated with respect to the estimated baseline runtime which would have occurred if the thermostat was operating in standard-programmable mode. To enable a direct comparison of a suite\u2019s HVAC runtime using occupancy-based or load shifting control against the HVAC runtime in the baseline scenario under the same weather conditions, a baseline runtime prediction model was developed for each suite using baseline runtime and weather condition data. This prediction model was then used to estimate baseline runtime for the same set of weather conditions observed during periods in which occupancy-based or load shifting control strategies were used. The estimated baseline control runtime and measured occupancy-based or load shifting control runtime were then compared to assess the change in runtime between the different control scenarios. This change in HVAC runtime from the use of the occupancy-based control strategy is calculated using Equation (1): (1) Δ R u n t i m e OccupancyPredicted = Runtime OccupancyActual - R u n t i m e BaselinePredicted Likewise, the difference between the actual runtime resulting from the load shifting control strategy and the predicted baseline runtime from the prediction model, is calculated using Equation (2): (2) Δ R u n t i m e LoadShiftingPredicted = Runtime LoadShiftingActual - R u n t i m e BaselinePredicted Note that the formulations of Equations (1) and (2) yield reductions in runtime as negative values and increases in runtime as positive values. Runtime predictions were made for hourly periods using a suite\u2019s regression model, however, these predictions were aggregated over a larger timeframe to increase prediction accuracy (further discussed in 3.4.1.3). 3.4.1 Prediction model development and Testing: In the study buildings, which have short terminal HVAC unit runtimes on average (as seen in Fig. 3, Section 3.1), accurately predicting thermostat-signaled HVAC runtime under different weather conditions is a significant challenge. In prior work, we tested different regression modelling approaches on the dataset and showed that different modelling approaches are needed in different suites to improve runtime prediction accuracy [27]. Further, even when a large variety of model types (e.g., random forest, neural networks, etc.), training methods (e.g., using different subsets of data to train the model), and model tuning processes are considered, sufficient predictive accuracy may not be achieved for many suites. As such, a mixed-approach was used to develop HVAC runtime prediction models for each suite. Three main model development approaches were tested for each suite: Approach (1): Develop individual models for each suite which are trained using only data collected from that suite (note that suite characteristic features were not included in this modelling process). Approach (2): Develop individual models for each suite which are trained using data collected from all suites for all seasonal periods. Approach (3): Simple stacked model with one Stage 1 Model and one Stage 2 Model. For Approaches (1) and (2), models were developed for each suite using both random forest (RF) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) [31] regression algorithms, which have been shown to have good performance in building energy management applications [32\u201337]. Further information on the random forest and XGBoost models and the rational for their selection can be found in the SI document. For each model type tested in Approaches 1 and 2, three different training data subsets were tested for each suite: only cooling season data; cooling and heating season data; and all available data (i.e., from cooling, heating, and shoulder seasons). For each of the Approach 1 and 2 models, the same development process was followed. First, feature selection was performed (Section 3.4.1.1) followed by hyperparameter tuning (Section 3.4.1.2). For Approach (3), the best model from Approach (2) was used as the Stage 1 Model. For the Stage 2 Model, the type was selected based on the model type used in the Stage 1 Model. If the Stage 1 Model was an RF model, the Stage 2 Model was an XGBoost model (as shown in Fig. 4 ) and vice-versa. The Stage 2 Model used the same feature set as the Stage 1 Model, however, the input dataset for the Stage 2 Model was limited to cooling season data collected form the individual suite for which the model was developed. All tested models were implemented using the Scikit-learn package in Python [38]. During model development, available baseline-control data were divided into separate training and testing sets (training set = 75% of data; testing set = 25% of data). Model performance metrics were evaluated using the testing dataset, which was never seen by the model during training. An adapted mean absolute percentage error calculation (A-MAPE) was used to guide the model development process. The adapted MAPE formula used to calculate error is shown in Equation (3), where n is the number of test values, At is the actual runtime value, A - is the average of the test set runtime values, and Ft is the predicted runtime value. Note that the A-MAPE formula was used due to the existence of numerous actual zero-runtime values in the dataset, the error for which cannot be evaluated using standard MAPE calculations. (3) A - M A P E = 1 n ∑ t = 1 n A t - F t A - After the models in Approaches 1, 2, and 3 were developed for each suite, the best-performing model in terms of A-MAPE for each suite was selected for use as the final prediction model. However, for most suites, the predictive accuracy of these final models for individual hourly periods was insufficient to use for evaluation of runtime changes due to occupancy-based or load shifting control. To improve the accuracy of evaluating changes in runtime due to different control strategies, several aggregation methods were applied to the data (Section 3.4.1.3). 3.4.1.1 Feature selection Features were selected out of the available data, as outlined in Section 3.2. First, each model was trained using only outdoor air temperature as the independent variable. Next, features were added one at a time to the model. If an individual feature improved (i.e., reduced) the A-MAPE of the model, it was selected to remain in the model. For models developed using the RF algorithm, feature selection was completed using the default hyperparameters, with the exception of the number of estimators, which was set to 1500. For the XGBoost algorithm, the learning rate was set to 0.1, the maximum depth to 6, the minimum child weight to 5, and the maximum number of estimators to 10,000 with early stopping after 100 rounds and all other parameters left as the default values. 3.4.1.2 Hyperparameter tuning Hyperparameter tuning was completed using a Bayesian search for the random forest model and an exhaustive grid search for the XGBoost model to test different permutations of selected hyperparameter values using two-fold cross-validation. Further details on the hyperparameter selection process for individual model classes is included in the SI document. 3.4.1.3 Data Aggregation for improved accuracy Two different aggregation methods were used to generate higher accuracy runtime predictions: 1) aggregation of individual suite data over the entire cooling season (\u201cTotal Aggregation\u201d); and 2) aggregation of individual suite runtime changes for hourly intervals with all suite data in each building (\u201cBuilding Aggregation\u201d). 4 Results and discussion In this section, first, the accuracy of the baseline runtime prediction models is reviewed. Next, the performance of the occupancy-based and load shifting control strategies are analyzed and the potential impacts of the control strategies on thermal comfort and dehumidification are discussed. 4.1 Prediction model accuracy The A-MAPE for each thermostat model for the cooling season data was between 9% and 83% (average error of 31%), when individual hourly periods were considered for each suite. As the runtime prediction errors remained high for individual hourly periods, Total Aggregation was primarily used for evaluating changes in runtime between the baseline control scenario and the occupancy-based control scenario in aggregate over the entire testing period for each suite (Section 4.1.1) and, when hourly data was required, Building Aggregation was used for evaluation of both the occupancy-based and load shifting control scenarios (Section 4.1.2). 4.1.1 Total Aggregation The average error with Total Aggregation was 10% (range: 0.4% to 115%). Nine suites had HVAC runtime prediction errors over 15% when Total Aggregation was used, which were excluded from further cooling season analysis. Seven of these nine suites had very low HVAC runtimes during the baseline scenario (average of 2.8 min/hour) when compared to the average across all suites (11.5 min/hour), which likely explains the high percentage error. Further, due to the minimal existing suite loads, HVAC runtime reductions in these seven low-runtime suites would have minimal impact on building energy use. The reason for the high prediction error in the remaining suites was not easy to discern, however, it may be a result of a combination of lower than average HVAC runtimes (7 min/hour), high variation in runtime due to frequent occupant control overrides, and/or changes in occupant behaviour throughout the study period. When the runtime prediction error under the Total Aggregation scenario for the cooling season was considered with the seven suites omitted, the average prediction error across suites was reduced to 4.6%. Ultimately, data from 41 suites (84% of suites) were available for analysis for the cooling season when Total Aggregation is used, based on model predictive performance. 4.1.2 Building Aggregation When Building Aggregation was used, the average baseline runtime prediction accuracy was 4.6% in Building A and 6.1% in Building B for all hourly periods. In Building A, the minimum average hourly error occurred at 21:00 (0.8% prediction error) and the maximum average hourly error occurred at 13:00 (11.7% prediction error). In Building B, the minimum average hourly error occurred at 19:00 (1.6% prediction error) and the maximum average hourly error occurred at 07:00 (10.9% prediction error). 4.2 Occupancy control strategy performance results An average of 1303 occupancy-based control hourly periods for each thermostat were available for the cooling season analysis (min: 172 hourly periods, max: 2567 hourly periods). In the cooling season under baseline thermostat operation, the average suite-based HVAC runtime was 287 min/day (range: 16.6 min/day to 763 min/day). When occupancy-based control was used, a wide range of runtime changes as compared to the baseline control scenario were observed in the suites (see Fig. 5 ). Runtime reductions as high as 142 ± 13 min/day were observed, along with runtime increases as high as 118 min ± 47 min/day (using Total Aggregation). On average, suite-based HVAC system runtime during the cooling season decreased by 5.9% (15 min/day, standard deviation of ± 117 min/day) over baseline scenario. We hypothesize that, in many suites, runtime reductions were limited by building operational patterns, which were previously shown to result in low suite-based HVAC runtimes and frequent over-conditioning of suites, despite available thermostat temperature controls [39]. However, when a t-test was used to evaluate if there was any statistically significant difference in runtime changes between the two groups, suites with lower than average daily HVAC runtime had higher percent change in runtime as compared to suites with higher than average daily HVAC runtimes (p = 0.24). A difference between occupancy-based control strategy performance in the two study buildings was observed. Higher runtime reductions were achieved through the use of the occupancy-based control strategy in Building B as compared to Building A. On average, in Building B, runtime decreased by 8.3% (19 min/day) and, in Building A, runtime decreased by 3.1% (9.6 min/day) using occupancy-based control. It is unclear why this difference occurred, as the average runtime in Building B was lower in the baseline scenario (average = 250 min/day) as compared to Building A (average = 382 min/day) and participant demographics were similar in the two buildings. Further, in previous work, suites in Building B were observed to have more frequent periods of over-conditioning in the cooling season as compared to Building A [39]. The hourly percent change in runtime for Buildings A and B when Building Aggregation was used is shown in Fig. 6 . Runtime decreases due to the use of occupancy-based control were predominately observed during the midday period, when suites are frequently unoccupied, between the hours of 08:00 and 18:00 (average runtime reduction of 11 ± 8%), while runtime increases were predominately observed during the overnight period, between the hours of 23:00 and 05:00 (average runtime increase of 4 ± 5%). Notably, the estimated average increase in runtime during the overnight hours was within the bounds of the prediction error for that time period and may not actually represent an actual increase in runtime due to the control strategy. However, this general pattern (runtime decreases during midday hours and small runtime increases during overnight hours) is amenable with electricity grid operations in regions similar to Ontario Canada, where on-peak hours (and associated higher marginal electricity generation costs and emissions) occur during midday periods and off-peak hours occur overnight. 4.2.1 Remarks on efficacy of occupancy-based control in high-rise residential buildings While the observed suite-based HVAC runtime reductions resulting from the use of occupancy-based control were moderate in the cooling season, there may be an opportunity to increase runtime reductions (and associated building energy use reductions) by changing how the central space conditioning systems in these two buildings are operated. Over-conditioning of the suites was observed in both buildings during the heating and cooling seasons [39], which resulted in low suite-based HVAC runtimes and minimal opportunity for runtime reductions through occupancy-based control mechanisms. Reducing space conditioning provided to building common areas (i.e., through conditioned corridor ventilation) could shift the conditioning burden to the suites and reduce the energy use by central building systems. This approach would allow individual suite-based HVAC systems to be more responsive to demand and only provide conditioned air where and when it is needed. After this building tuning, occupancy-based thermostat controls in suites would likely be more effective in reducing overall building HVAC loads. However, without this tuning, the potential to reduce building HVAC loads by applying this strategy in contemporary high-rise residential buildings is limited, given the frequent lack of on-going commissioning in this building type. 4.3 Load shifting strategy performance Load shifting HVAC control may be used to reduce HVAC loads during electricity grid peak periods by over-conditioning spaces overnight. When the performance of the load shifting strategy was assessed on average across all suites, regardless of whether occupants chose to cancel the strategy setpoint changes at any point, a 6% decrease in HVAC load between the hours of 11:00 and 17:00 was observed (Fig. 7 ). To achieve this increase, however, an average daily load increase of 36% was required. As the magnitude and time distribution of suite HVAC loads vary based on the cardinal direction the suite faces, it is worthwhile to consider the impacts of the load shifting strategy on suites facing each cardinal direction for test days when few (less than two cumulative hours) strategy overrides occurred (Fig. 8 ). Data from 18 suites were available for analysis (three north-facing suites, two south-facing suites, three east-facing suites, and ten west-facing suites). The timing of the periods of load reductions and increases varied substantially between the groups due to differences in when direct solar radiation is incident on the suites\u2019 exterior facades. In this scenario, pre-existing short HVAC runtimes limited the opportunities for absolute reduction in runtime in south-facing suites. Of the suites facing the other cardinal directions, north-facing suites exhibit the most useful shifted load profile, in which HVAC load between the hours of 11:00 and 15:00 was decreased by 51% with an overnight (18:00 to 10:00) load increase of 185%. Better management of solar gains (e.g. through improved window shade use or solar films), would likely improve the effectiveness of this strategy and allow for improvements to mid-day load reductions in suites facing the other three cardinal directions. While on average, across all of the studied suites, the load shifting strategy was largely ineffective at reducing peak period loading, north-facing suites in general as well as some individual suites facing other directions demonstrated significant load reductions during the daytime peak periods. As an example, three individual suites facing north, east, and west are shown in Fig. 9 (note that the south-facing suites are excluded as the orginal and shifted load profiles do not substantially vary from the aggregate profiles shown in Fig. 8). In the suites shown in Fig. 9, the north-facing suite showed a 66% HVAC load reduction between the hours of 11:00 and 17:00 and the west-facing suite showed a 44% reduction during the same time period. The east-facing suite did not show a reduction in HVAC load between the hours of 11:00 and 17:00 overall, however, HVAC loads were reduced by 100% between the hours of 12:00 and 13:00. To achieve this, overall daily HVAC loads in the west- and east-facing suites were increased by approximately 80% each and the HVAC load in the north-facing suite increased by 39%. Of the suites with data from periods with few strategy overrides, two of the three north-facing suites, one of the three east-facing suites, four of the ten west-facing suites, and both of the two south-facing suites, showed substantial reductions for some portion of the on-peak hours between 11:00 and 17:00. It is not clear why the load shifting strategy was effective in some suites and not others. There did not appear to be a relationship between average baseline suite HVAC runtime, suite direction, or which building the suite was in. Usage patterns and type of window coverings installed in the suite and occupant use of auxillary devices are potential reasons for this difference. 4.3.1 Potential for GHG emissions reductions from load shifting While GHG emissions reductions from load shifting control will vary significantly based on suite load profiles and the jurisdiction the electricity is consumed in, it is still worthwhile to consider an approximation of the GHG impacts of this strategy. For the purpose of this estimate, the HVAC runtime changes over a one-day period from the north-, west-, and east -facing suites shown in Fig. 9 are considered and marginal emissions factors based on the Ontario electricity grid are used. Note that the energy and GHG emission calculations for the north-facing suite (located in Building B) assume the use of a fan coil and chiller system, as used in Building A, for consistency of the example amongst the four suites. Marginal emissions factors (MEFs) represent the GHG emissions (increase or decrease) associated with any increase or decrease in electricity consumption during a specific period. MEFs are dependent the operating conditions of the electricity grid and vary with respect to the time of day and season, as well as year-to-year based on generation infrastructure and demand changes. As MEFs must be estimated based on grid operation data and can vary significantly, several different hourly MEFs were tested. These include marginal emissions factors estimated by two different sources: 1) the summer seasonal average hourly MEF for 2018 by The Atmospheric Fund [2]and 2) monthly-average hourly MEFs based on 2017 data estimated by Gai et al. [40]. To calculate the energy changes from strategy use in the example suite, the manufacturer nameplate cooling capacity of the suite terminal HVAC unit (2.7 kW in the north-facing suite, 5.7 kW in the west-facing suite, and 6.0 kW in the east-facing suite) was used to calculate the hourly energy use within the suite based on an assumed primary energy use efficiency of 65% (accounting for fan coil operation and central system energy use by the chiller, pumps, etc.). Equation (4) was used to calculate hourly energy use: (4) EnergyUse Hour = Runtime Hour x N a m e p l a t e C o o l i n g C a p a c i t y x P r i m a r y E n e r g y U s e E f f i c i e n c y The hourly change in GHG emissions between the baseline scenario and the load shifting scenario was calculated using Equation (5): (5) Δ G H G E m i s s i o n s Hour = MEF Hour ( EnergyUse LoadShifting , H o u r - EnergyUse Baseline , H o u r ) Changes in GHG emissions from the use of the load shifting strategy in the example suites are shown for the different tested MEFs in Table 5 . The changes in emissions estimated vary significantly based on the MEFs used, however, for the example west- and east-facing suites, all scenarios resulted in an overall increase in GHG emissions. For example, in the north-facing suite, when the seasonal MEFs for summer 2018 were used, a net increase in GHG emissions of 412% was found, however when the monthly MEFs for July 2017 were used, a GHG emissions reduction of 11% was found. Based on this, the load shifting HVAC control strategy does not appear to have the potential to reduce GHGs emissions in the Ontario electricity market, however, in the future, as MEFs change in the Ontario market, or in different jurisdictions with different electricity grid operations, very different results may be found. The timing of on-peak periods and the ratio of on\u2013 to off-peak GHG emissions factors associated with marginal electricity consumptions will substantially how this control strategy impacts total GHG emissions. Therefore, detailed consideration of grid-specific MEFs which take into variation due to changing grid demand and generation conditions should be used to assess when and where use of the load shifting control strategy is needed. While load shifting control does not make sense as an emissions reduction strategy for the Ontario electricity grid based on the studied populations, this control strategy has the potential reduce peak loading during periods when the grid capacity is constrained or when building HVAC systems do not have sufficient capacity to meet peak daytime conditioning loads (e.g., during an extreme heat event). However, careful consideration of suite characteristics which drive baseline and shifted load profiles and strategy efficacy (e.g., suite orientation) is needed. Further study of a larger sample size of suites is needed to better understand the key mechanisms which influence strategy performance. The use of night-time, passive free-cooling via increased outdoor air ventilation may also provide opportunities for emissions reductions. However, the nature of ventilation systems in this building type regionally (i.e., the use of pressurized corridor ventilation systems with no provision of direct ventilation to suites) and the typically high relative humidity of outdoor air during summer nights in the region may limit the effectiveness of this approach and necessitates further investigation. 4.4 Thermal comfort and dehumidification impacts While not discussed in detail this paper, the impacts of the occupancy-based and load shifting control strategies on occupant thermal comfort in the studied suites was assessed in previous work by the authors [41]. Based on analysis of survey data and occupant-initiated control strategy overrides (e.g., the use of thermostat \u201cholds\u201d), no significant change in occupant thermal comfort in the suites was observed between periods of occupancy-based control and periods of baseline thermal control. While no survey data were available to evaluate any change in thermal sensation when the load shifting control strategy was used during the cooling season, participants frequently overrode the load shifting control strategy, which indicates that they experienced some degree of thermal discomfort beyond their tolerance level. Further discussion of the thermal comfort impacts of the control strategies can be found in [41]. The effects of the tested control strategies on the dehumidification of indoor air relative to outdoor air dew point temperatures during the cooling season was also considered. Fig. 10 shows the difference in suite dew point temperatures and outdoor air dew point temperatures for periods in which the thermostats were operated using each of the three control strategies. Note that the dehumidification data for the load shifting control strategy excludes test periods in which an individual suite overrode the control strategy for more than two-hours. 4.4.1 Occupancy-based control A significant difference in dehumidification between periods of occupancy-based control and baseline control was observed in both study buildings (Building A p-value < 0.001, Building B p-value < 0.001). In Building A, occupancy-based control was associated with increased dehumidification as compared to the baseline scenario, with a small effect size (Hedge\u2019s g = 0.19). In Building B, periods in which occupancy-based control was used were associated with less dehumidification on average, however, in practicality, due to the small effect size of this change (Hedge\u2019s g = 0.06), no significant impact was observed. 4.4.2 Load shifting based control To understand the impacts of the load shifting control strategy as designed, only data from test periods during which a suite did not override the strategy for at least 22 out of 24 h were considered in this portion of the analysis. In both buildings, the load shifting control strategy was associated with increased dehumidification as compared to the baseline scenario (Building A p-value < 0.001, Building B p-value < 0.001). In Building A, the load shifting control strategy resulted in a large increase dehumidification (Hedge\u2019s g = 1.11), corresponding to an incremental decrease in indoor air dew point of approximately 1.8 °C typically. In Building B, the increase in dehumidification was smaller (Hedge\u2019s g = 0.44), corresponding to an incremental decrease in indoor dew point of approximately 1.5 °C on average. While the load shifting control strategy resulted in improved dehumidification overall, surface condensation on cooled thermal mass may be of concern under some outdoor conditions. In general, the surface temperatures of suite thermal mass during load shifting control are expected to remain above the dew point of the indoor air: modelled surface temperature data suggest a lower limit on wall surface temperature of around 22 °C, while indoor dewpoint temperatures reached a maximum of 21 °C and only exceeded 20 °C 10 % of the time during load shifting control periods. That being said, given the high indoor dew point temperatures in study suites, surface condensation may occur during some time periods due to variation in thermal mass surface temperatures between suites and differences in outdoor conditions. However, even during baseline operation, high humidity is present in both of the study buildings. The 2019 revisions of ASHRAE Standard 62.1 suggests that a maximum dew point of 15 °C be maintained in mechanically cooled buildings [42]. During baseline control periods, this threshold was exceeded on average 48% of the time in Building A and 29% of the time in Building B during cooling season. As such, indicate that additional dehumidification is needed in both study buildings to keep indoor dew points below the recommended 15 °C maximum, which, when implemented, would reduce the likelihood of surface condensation due to load shifting control. 5 Conclusions In this study, the energy performance of occupancy-based and load shifting thermostat control strategies was tested using smart thermostats in 49 suites across two contemporary high-rise residential buildings in Toronto, Canada during the cooling season. Data were collected on HVAC terminal unit runtime and weather conditions under three thermostat control scenarios: 1) baseline control, in which the thermostat was operated as a standard programable thermostat; 2) occupancy-based control using the thermostat\u2019s built-in occupancy detection features; and 3) a novel load shifting control strategy, in which pre-conditioning was used to shift HVAC load from peak day time periods to overnight periods. Using black-box regression models, measured suite HVAC runtime during occupancy-based and load shifting control periods were compared with prediction runtime for the baseline control scenario during the same outdoor and in-suite conditions. We found: \u2022 Substantial variation in control strategy performance was observed for different suites, which is likely driven by suite usage patterns and occupant behaviours (including the use of window coverings); \u2022 On average, across the study population, occupancy-based control reduced suite HVAC runtime by 5.9% (standard deviation = 46%); \u2022 The largest change in suite HVAC runtime occurred during the daytime period (08:00 to 18:00), during which an average reduction in runtime of 11% was observed; \u2022 This suggests that installation of smart thermostats may be a cost-effective energy conservation measure in this type of building, however, building re- or retro-commissioning should be completed first to ensure space conditioning loads are being met by in-suite HVAC systems as opposed to common area conditioning systems; \u2022 On average, load shifting-based control did not substantially reduce HVAC runtime during on-peak hours (11:00 to 17:00) in the studied suites; \u2022 In 10 of the studied suites, substantial reductions in HVAC runtime for portions of on-peak periods were observed, however, to achieve these reductions large increases in overnight HVAC runtime was required; \u2022 Based on marginal emissions factors for the Ontario electricity grid, even in suites with substantial on-peak HVAC runtime reductions, the load shifting control strategy was shown to increase GHG emissions in the majority of scenarios; and \u2022 While load shifting control does not make sense as an emissions reduction strategy based on the studied populations, this control strategy has the potential to be employed to reduce peak loading during periods in which grid capacity is constrained or when building HVAC systems do not have sufficient capacity to meet peak daytime conditioning loads (e.g., during an extreme heat events).

        "dc:description": "As the proportion of the population who resides in urban centers grows, the number of dwellings in high-rise residential buildings is also increasing. In Canada, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) typically accounts for over half of all energy use in this building type and, as such, consideration of these loads is key to effective energy demand-side management. Smart thermostats present a new opportunity conserve energy and shift electricity load to off-peak periods in these buildings through modifications to HVAC control strategies. In this study, three thermostat control strategies were tested in 49 suites across two contemporary high-rise residential buildings: 1) baseline operation (thermostat operating as a standard programmable thermostat); 2) occupancy-based control (thermostat operating using an occupancy-reactive control strategy); 3) load shifting control (thermostat operating using a pre-conditioning strategy). HVAC runtime data was collected from smart thermostats installed in the suites and was used to develop data-driven regression models to estimate baseline suite HVAC runtime based on weather conditions and suite characteristics. Thermostat-measured HVAC runtime data for periods in which occupancy-based or load shifting control strategies were in use in the suite was then compared with estimated baseline runtime for similar outdoor conditions. Occupancy-based control was found to reduce HVAC system runtime during the cooling seasonby 5.9% ± 46% on average. On aggregate, the load shifting control strategy was not effective at reducing peak period HVAC load during the cooling season. The strategy was able to reduce peak period loads in a subset of suites substantially, which may be leveraged to reduce electricity demand during capacity-constrained periods of grid operation, however, based on marginal emissions factors for Ontario\u2019s electricity grid, even in these suites, the strategy was not effective in reducing GHG emissions overall.",
