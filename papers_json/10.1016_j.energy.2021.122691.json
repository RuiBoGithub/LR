Implementing multi-objective optimal controls in buildings is challenging and often not tractable due to the complexity of the problem and the computational burden that frequently accompanies such optimization problems. In this work, we extract near-optimal rule sets from a database of non-dominated solutions, created by applying multi-objective model predictive control to detailed EnergyPlus models. We first apply multi-criteria decision analysis to rank the non-dominated solutions and select a subset of consistent and plausible operating strategies that can satisfy operator or occupant preferences. Next, unsupervised clustering is applied to highlight recurring control patterns. In the final step, we build a supervised classification model to identify the right optimal temperature control patterns for a particular day. The performance of the simplified rule sets is then quantified through simulation. Despite the dramatically simpler form, the best rule sets were able to achieve 95\u201397% of the energy savings and 89\u201392% of the cost objective savings of the fully detailed model predictive controller, while achieving similar thermal comfort and peak electrical demand. Graphical abstract Image 1 Keywords Clustering Classification Multi-objective optimization Rule extraction Model predictive control of buildings 1 Introduction As one of the largest consumers of electricity, improvements in the buildings sector are needed to help mitigate and reverse climate change worldwide. To support the transition to increased deployment and utilization of renewable energy, buildings need to be both more efficient and more flexible. Efficiency enables buildings to be more productive with each unit of energy consumed. Flexibility allows buildings to use more energy when it is available from clean generation sources, and to shift consumption patterns in a way that increases the overall efficiency of the grid. Buildings that are both efficient and flexible have come to be known as \u201cgrid-interactive efficient buildings (GEBs).\u201d The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that achievable levels of GEB deployment could lead to between $8 billion and $18 billion in annual U.S. electric power system benefits by 2030, with annual CO2 emissions reductions reaching 80 million tons [1]. A key component in realizing the potential of GEBs is the development and deployment of predictive supervisory controllers that can optimally plan building operation in response to local needs and dynamic grid conditions. Although optimal building controls have been studied for quite some time, promising technologies like model predictive control (MPC) are not yet mainstream [2]. Several current challenges have made widespread deployment of such technologies difficult to achieve in practice. First, generating detailed physics-based building energy models for MPC can be time consuming and costly. Second, using such models within an optimization framework can be too computationally demanding for real-time implementation if model complexity is high. Third, buildings are unique and traditional white-box modeling approaches do not transfer well to new buildings (i.e., the model developed for one building will likely not work well for another). Fourth, the control decisions that result from optimization can sometimes be challenging to explain or interpret, especially in the case of multiple objectives and grid incentives. In this work we aim to address several of these challenges by developing a new method to extract simple and interpretable supervisory building control rules from multiple optimal solutions, created by applying multi-objective model predictive control to detailed building energy models. We used the combination of unsupervised and supervised learning techniques, and identified both dominant and recurring control pattern with two-stage clustering analysis. The simplified rules take the form of a single decision tree, which promotes transparency between the advanced control strategies and the building owner/operators. The low-dimensionality of the trees also facilities ease of implementation in building automation systems. This paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, background on several data mining techniques used for rule extraction is described, along with multi-criteria decision analysis and multi-objective optimization. In Section 3, the proposed methods of this work are presented with the multi-criteria decision analysis, clustering, and classification techniques. In Section 4, the main case studies are described before highlighting the performance evaluation of the rule sets in Section 5. Finally, the conclusions and discussion are presented in Section 6. 2 Background In general, the various approaches to implementation of optimal building controls can be organized into three general categories, as highlighted in Fig. 1 . In the first approach, detailed models are developed and used directly to generate optimal control strategies. This method may be suitable for research settings, however, practical considerations can emerge with this approach when aiming for large-scale field deployment, as noted earlier. In the second approach, a surrogate model or building emulator is trained using data from the building. The goal here is to develop a reduced order model that captures the physical behavior of the building and energy systems reasonably well, but without the computational complexity of the original model. For this approach, grey-box reduced-order modeling techniques or machine learning models (e.g., neural networks, random forests, etc.) are commonly employed. Once the surrogate model has been developed, it can be coupled with optimization routines to generate control strategies. In the third approach, the detailed model and optimization environment are used in an offline setting to generate a database of optimal control strategies. After the database has been developed, machine learning methods can be trained to learn the functional mapping between input variables and the corresponding optimal control strategy. In the online setting, the machine learning model is used to directly generate control decisions without the need to run optimization algorithms in real-time. Although there are opportunities to make advancements in any of these general categories, in this paper we focus on the third method. More detailed discussion of related topics are provided in the subsections below. 2.1 Multi-objective optimization and model predictive control Intelligent building controls make a significant contribution to building thermal comfort, energy performance, and operating costs. The application of artificial intelligence techniques to model predictive controller demonstrated its effectiveness and robustness to control energy systems compared with conventional proportional-integral controller [3]. In order to achieve more than one objective with the intelligent building controller, multiple objectives including energy, economic, and emission perspectives can be considered simultaneously [4,5]. Over the past decades, multi-criteria optimization techniques have been applied to net zero energy buildings [6,7], smart buildings [8], renewable energy systems [9\u201313], power systems [14], and distributed energy systems [15\u201317]. Deng et al. [18] combined the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and grey relational Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) for optimal building heating system selection. Delgarm et al. [19] applied multi-objective optimization algorithms to building model predictive controls (MPC) to enhance building performance. Naderi et al. [20] and Wonuk Kim [21] also studied a model-based multi-objective optimal control strategy for heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems. In addition, multi-objective optimization has been applied to different types of building systems [22\u201325], and it successfully demonstrated its effectiveness in engineering problems as it improves both energy system efficiency and economic benefits [26,27]. With trade-offs among the conflicting objectives, a number of non-dominated solutions formed a Pareto-front as a result of the optimization. Applying the multi-objective optimization showed that the final optimal solution significantly improved building performance, demonstrating the technique in solving complex building design and operational problems. However, after developing the pareto set of solutions, it is still required for building operators or decision-makers to select a single control strategy to implement among the full set of non-dominated solutions. 2.2 Multi-criteria decision analysis To facilitate and automate consistent decision making, Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) has been studied in recent decades. Ascione et al. [28,29] performed multi-criteria decision analysis after solving the multi-objective genetic algorithm to determine the optimal set-point temperature for the HVAC system. The decision was made based on the characteristic of weather for a specific day considering energy cost and thermal comfort. They achieved cost reduction with the proposed method in the case study. In another way, Harkouss et al. [6] applied a ranking decision-making technique and Zhu et al. [30] proposed the Utopian point method for building control. However, the multi-objective optimization itself already has a large amount of computational burden and the decision-making process accompanies another computational work. Thus, it makes it difficult to simply apply the technique in practice. To reduce the computing time, Si et al. [31] applied an artificial neural network (ANN) and demonstrated the technique in solving complex building design problems. Beykal et al. [32] utilized parallel algorithms for computational efficiency to optimize the multi-objective energy market design problems for a commercial building. 2.3 Data mining and rule extraction As a post-process of multi-objective optimization, data mining techniques have been applied to analyze the relationship in the optimization problems for building control. The operational features could be extracted by statistical, model-based, and pattern-based behavior from the result data [33]. May-Ostendorp et al. [34] introduced a statistical technique to extract a logistic decision model from optimization results to control window operation in buildings. The optimization results during summer were used as a training data set and operational characteristics for the rest of the days were predicted using a generalized linear model (GLM). The developed model was able to achieve 70\u201390% of the energy savings from the original solutions, with a small amount of the computational cost. This research demonstrated that the decision model can be applied to control building systems, however, it has stability issues to implement GLM model as controllers in real-time. Bandaru et al. [35,36] proposed four data mining methods to extract knowledge from the optimization solutions, which are sequential pattern mining, clustering-based classification trees, hybrid learning, and flexible pattern mining. Each method used a unique learning strategy to generate explicit knowledge from the patterns, decision rules, and unsupervised rules. They tested the methods for the design of production systems. As a result, similar knowledge was discovered from each method application. They demonstrated that the rules from the flexible pattern mining are the most consistent, while the rules generated by classification trees are observing user preferences. Nojima et al. [37] utilized multi-objective genetic fuzzy rule selection to develop the non-dominated solutions. They applied the method to the beam design and rocket engine design. With this method, a set of patterns was generated and fuzzy rules were determined by classification rule mining. However, a major drawback of the fuzzy rule is that it is highly dependent on the expert's knowledge and experiences. Das and Pratihar [38] proposed an approach to establish relationships between input variables and output of manufacturing processes. An initial set of Pareto-front solutions was used to train a neuro-fuzzy system. Then, a modified set of Pareto-front solutions was clustered. The clustered solutions were then analyzed to establish the relationships among decision variables and objectives. Tran et al. [39] applied fuzzy entropy method with similarity classifier for effective feature selection. With experimental analysis, they demonstrated its low computational burden and high classification accuracy compared to other existing machine learning techniques. Further, they [40] also introduced an artificial neural network (ANN) model for chatter classification and important features were selected using the recursive feature elimination method. They provided its effectiveness under industrial conditions and higher accuracy over existing schemes. Elsisi et al. [41] developed a hybrid fuzzy logic and nonlinear sliding mode controller of which gains are modulated by artificial intelligent technique to manage distributed controllable loads in the grid. The proposed hybrid control strategy improved system response taking into account uncertainties of the parameters. Drgoňa et al. [42] proposed an approach to train a neural network with the MPC data based on a detailed office building model. This work demonstrated that the control method based on deep learning can not only reduce the computational work but also maintain the control performance. Tran et al. [43] applied decision tree, random forest, and extreme gradient boosting algorithms for a new IoT architecture to detect bearing faults and cyber-attack. The results showed that the case with random forest had the highest accuracy to provide reliable services. Further, Elsisi et al. [44] demonstrated the effectiveness of the new IoT architecture based on extreme gradient boosting to detect all defects in the gas-insulated switchgear (GIS) status and improved the decision-making with more clarified visualization. Sato et al. [45] proposed a method that sequentially applies clustering and association rule analysis to a Pareto-optimal solution set. First, clustering was applied and then detailed features in each cluster were analyzed based on the association rule analysis so that characteristics of each cluster of the solutions can be extracted. They demonstrated the performance of the proposed method with cantilever design problems and provided useful information for decision-makers with desired performance and effective design solutions. 2.4 Contributions Recent studies showed that researchers have been studying rule-extraction from the multi-objective optimization results. They demonstrated that data mining techniques could achieve a fraction of optimization results with a lower computational burden. However, there is very little research on simplified control rules for building HVAC control by applying data mining techniques as a post-process of multi-objective optimization. Especially, most research discarded outlier patterns from the potential optimal solutions at the beginning of the data analysis. However, the ultimate solution from the MCDA analysis could be the only control pattern that is highly related to the unique building state and unexpected circumstances at that moment. Having consistency as well as adaptability for a variety of scenarios would be the key source for an intelligent building control method. Therefore, it is essential to put importance on not just the frequent patterns but also the less frequent outlier-like patterns to provide near-optimal solutions with the simplified rule sets. In addition to that, it is desirable to develop a method that can make a reasonable decision with easier deployment while providing high performance. To address these needs, this work aims to propose a method to develop a set of simplified control strategies based on rule-extraction from multi-objective model predictive control data sets. The primary contributions of this paper are: \u2022 Combined use of unsupervised and supervised learning techniques for consistent and interpretable rules extraction applied to multi-objective building control problem. \u2022 Two-stage density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) clustering to identify and preserve both the dominant, recurring patterns and the important outliers. \u2022 Low-dimensional classification trees for high interpretability and ease of implementation. Based on the literature reviewed, we believe this is the first study on rule extraction with multi-objective optimization applied to a building control problem. 3 Methods Fig. 2 illustrates the proposed process for extracting interpretable supervisory control rules from multi-objective building MPC data sets. First, the non-dominated optimization solutions (i.e., the Pareto set) from the multi-objective MPC optimization runs are loaded. Based on the building owner's preferences, each point on the Pareto front is ranked using the PROMETHEE II multi-criteria decision analysis algorithm [46,47]. The top-ranked solutions are selected represent the subset of preferred (PREF) control strategies from the full Pareto set. In this work we take the top 15 control strategies as the set of PREF control strategies, each of which is a daily control profile. Next the PREF strategies are clustered into several groups based on the similarity of the daily control profiles using DBSCAN. A set of archetypal control patterns is then generated by taking the average control profile of each cluster group. Finally, a decision tree classification model is developed that maps the conditions (i.e., predictor variables) for a particular day to one of the archetypal control strategies. The performance of the classification prediction rules are then evaluated through simulation experiments that compare the building control performance under both detailed MPC and simplified control rules. More detail on each of the individual steps is provided in the following subsections. 3.1 Multi-objective model predictive control data set To generate the data set of detailed MPC solutions, we use the a posteriori multi-objective optimizer NSGA-II [48] to solve daily model predictive control problems for one summer month. MPC was performed with 24 h-optimization horizon. Regarding the parameters for NSGA-II, we used the default settings [49]. The population size is 50, crossover rate is 0.8, and the mutation rate is 0.2. Setting the maximum number of iterations to 100 as a stopping criteria, it was implemented using Matlab. This results in a Pareto set of control strategies for each day of the month. The MPC environment is discussed in more detail in Corbin et al. [50], and has been extended for multi-objective optimization. In this work, it is desired to minimize the four objectives of energy use (C econsum ), total cost (C total ), comfort penalty (C comfort ), and peak demand penalty (C dempen ) as described by the formulation in Eq. (1), (1) min ( C e c o n s u m , C t o t a l , C c o m f o r t , C d e m p e n ) (2) Subject to: T l o w e r , k ≤ T o p t i m a l , k ≤ T u p p e r , k ∀ k ∈ K = { 1 , 2 , \u2025 , 24 } The decision variables are hourly zone air temperature setpoints for the HVAC system (T optimal,k ), which are subject to upper and lower bound constraints as in Eq. (2). The objectives are computed as in Eqs. (3)\u2013(10), (3) C e c o n s u m = ∑ k ∈ K E h v a c , k (4) C e c o s t = ∑ k ∈ K ( p e E h v a c , k ) (5) C e p e n = ( C e c o n s u m − C e c o n s u m n s u ) × μ e p e n (6) C c h i l p e n = μ c h i l ∑ k ∈ K s r m s , k (7) C e s p e n = μ e s ∑ k ∈ K max s e s , k − s e s , k n s u , 0 (8) C d e m p e n = max max E h v a c o p − E o p , 0 × μ o p + max max E h v a c p e a k − E p e a k , 0 × μ d e m p e n (9) C c o m f o r t = ∑ r ∈ R ∑ k ∈ K max P M V o c c , r , k − 0.5 , 0 × N o c c , r , k (10) C t o t a l = C e c o s t + C e p e n + C e s p e n + C c h i l p e n where C econsum denotes the total HVAC energy consumption over the planning horizon calculated by the sum of the hourly HVAC electric demand E hvac,k as in Eq. (3), and C ecost denotes the energy cost estimated by the sum of the hourly HVAC energy consumption E hvac,k multiplied by the flat energy rate p e of $0.061 3/kWh as in Eq. (4). C epen represents an extra energy penalty/incentive term for deviating from the default (i.e., NSU) energy consumption level. The difference between the NSU energy consumption C e c o n s u m N S U and the candidate solution is multiplied by the penalty factor μ epen as in Eq. (5). In this case, the energy penalty is allowed to be negative if the candidate strategy uses less energy. C chilpen denotes an extra cost associated with starting a chiller. This deters the optimizer from excessive switching of large chilled water plant equipment, and is calculated by multiplying the number of chiller starts s rms by the cost factor μ chil as in Eq. (6). C espen denotes the early start penalty, which can account for any costs associated with personnel overtime or other operator costs. s es is the number of hours that the building starts before NSU operation s e s n s u , and μ es is the early start cost factor as in Eq. (7). C dempen denotes the total demand penalty. When the maximum HVAC electric demand E h v a c o p is over a fixed demand limit E op during the whole operation hours, a small amount of demand penalty μ op is applied. During the peak hours (from 1 p.m. to 8 p.m.), a large peak demand penalty μ dempen is multiplied by the extra demand over the peak limit E peak as in Eq. (8). C comfort denotes the comfort penalty. When the predicted mean vote (PMV) of a zone r at time k, which represents the human sensation of thermal comfort, is over 0.5 or below −0.5 [51], the occupancy weighted comfort penalty is calculated as in Eq. (9). Note that since comfort is included as a specific optimization objective, the lower and upper temperature setpoint bounds during occupied hours were set at 21.67 °C (71 °F) and 26.67 °C (80 °F), respectively, to allow the optimizer more room to explore optimal setpoint strategies. C total denotes the sum of the cost values of energy cost C ecost , energy consumption C epen , early start penalty C espen , and chiller penalty C chilpen as in Eq. (10). The building model used in this work is a large commercial office building simulated with Washington, D.C. weather and pricing data. Cooling is provided to the building zones by chilled-water variable-air-volume (VAV) air-handlers and cooling-only terminal boxes. Zone heating is performed by electric resistance baseboard heaters. The central plant features two centrifugal chillers, two cooling towers, and water pumps (Fig. 3 ). The detailed MPC environment makes use of a physics-based multi-zone EnergyPlus model of the building, which includes high-fidelity building load and energy calculations. The equipment models include non-linear part-load performance curves and realistic dynamic limits on capacity and flows. Select building characteristics are summarized in Table 1 . 3.2 Ranking with PROMETHEE II multi-criteria decision analysis algorithm The multi-objective MPC results in numerous non-dominated control solutions for each planning horizon (i.e., 24 h period). PROMETHEE II is applied as a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) algorithm to rank each of the non-dominated solutions based on building owner preferences. PROMETHEE II is based on pair-wise comparisons of the objective values for each set of points along the Pareto-front. Preference functions are specified for each objective that articulate the preference given to one point versus another, based on the objective value differences. Preference functions may describe the user preference based on absolute differences or based on relative (i.e., percent) differences. The preference scores are then added up for all combinations of pair-wise comparisons to determine the overall ranking of each point [46,47]. The strategy at Rank 1 is deemed to be the most preferred strategy and would serve as the selected control strategy to implement. In this work, we take the 15 top-ranked points as a set of control strategies that most closely aligns with the operator or occupants\u2019 preferences. The set of top ranked solutions based on the given preferences are labeled as the set of PREF solutions. 3.3 Clustering analysis In order to look for general operating patterns among the PREF solutions, clustering analysis is performed. In this work, the DBSCAN clustering algorithm is applied to group the control profiles that are close to each other based on the Euclidean distance measurement and it also marks outlier points in low-density regions. To get a reasonable number of clusters, selection of several parameters of the DBSCAN algorithm are important. First the maximum distance between two samples for one to be considered as in the neighborhood of the other (eps) must be set. Second, the minimum number of control profiles (min_samples) to form a region of the cluster must also be selected. If the minimum number of control profiles in a cluster is greater than 1, some points may be labeled as outliers. To effectively select proper parameter values, K-nearest neighbor search is applied in this study [52]. It calculates the distances of each point to its nearest neighbor points (min_samples). Then, the K-distances is sorted and plotted in ascending order to find the knee, which corresponds to a desirable eps. Fig. 4 depicts an example of a plot and the K-distances have been sorted in ascending order. In this figure, the distance (eps) can be determined to be 2.7. In order to cluster 20 to 30 archetypal control strategies, we performed two-stage DBSCAN clustering. In the first stage of clustering, eps and min_samples were set to 2.7 and 2, respectively, using the PREF solutions. In the second stage of clustering, eps was set to 3.4, min_samples was set to 1 to include outlier regions even with only one single profile. The set of first-stage clusters and the outlier patterns from the second-stage clusters are combined to make a full set of clusters, to allow important outlier control patterns to contribute to extract the characteristics of daily control patterns. After clustering with all the PREF solutions, the average daily patterns of the clustered groups are obtained. We call them \u201carchetypal\u201d control strategies. In this work, the Python scikit-learn DBSCAN library and NearestNeighbors library were used for clustering analysis [53]. 3.4 Classification The final step is to choose one suitable archetypal control strategy for a particular day based on predictor variables that are easily observed or forecasted. The primary goal is to find a simple and interpretable relationship between the archetypal control patterns and the independent variables that leads to building performance that is as close to the detailed MPC performance as possible. As it is well-known that Classification and Regression Tree (CART) models can lead to intuitive and interpretable rulesets, we selected CARTs as the machine learning method to apply to this supervised learning problem. The decision tree is composed of decision nodes, branches, and leaf nodes. The tree is typically depicted in the upside down orientation with the root node at the top, and leaves indicating the outcome at the bottom. Each decision node corresponds to a single input predictor variable. The produced result consists of a set of rules used for predicting the outcome variable as a function of the predictor variables. The rules are produced by repeatedly splitting the predictor variables, starting with the variable that has the highest association with the response variable. Cross-validation is used with the testing data to evaluate the accuracy of the prediction rate of the classification model. In this work, rpart (recursive partitioning and regression trees) function in the R was used for the CART algorithm. Here our aim, is to develop a single decision tree with a relatively small number of splits, which leads to a high degree of interpretability and ease of implementation. In this work, we utilized 1) the daily average outdoor air temperature of the previous day (Pst.Wx), 2) the daily average outdoor air temperature of the simulation day (Cur.Wx), 3) the daily average outdoor air temperature of the following day (Fut.Wx), 4) the average temperature of the building in the previous day (Pst.B.Te), 5) the occupancy schedule (Occupancy), and 6) the day of the week (Weekday) as input predictor variables. The most influential variables used in our work are numerical variables. Table 2 summarizes the selected predictor variables for HVAC operation control. 3.4.1 Case weight Additionally, the classification models explored the use of case weighting to take advantage of the ranking information from the PROMETHEE II algorithm. Case weight is to map each solution to a weight value following the ranking results. As all the PREF strategies are clustered into groups depending on their control characteristics without the property of rank, it may be helpful for the post-cluster CART algorithm to utilize the preference rank information, so that the performance of the extracted rule sets can be close to the optimal solution from the MCDA analysis. We propose two regression models that can be applied to set the weight value. In descending order from the top rank, the solutions are weighted based on the rank where they are involved, using either an exponential function or a linear function. First, linear case weight is representing that the weight value has a linear relationship with the rank. Thus, the top rank will have the highest weight value, and the last rank will have the lowest weight following the linear equation formulated in Eq. (11), (11) w = a 1 x + a 2 where, w denotes the weight value, x denotes the rank from PROMETHEE II algorithm, and a 1, a 2 are regression coefficients and intercept as a linear component. The regression coefficients are decided by setting the highest weight value for the rank 1 and the lowest weight for the rank 15. Exponential case weight reflects an exponential function that fits the ranks and weight value. The exponential model can impose more weights on the cases having higher ranks compared to a linear model. Eq. (12) formulates the exponential case weight function, (12) w = b 1 e b 2 x where, b 1, b 2 denotes the regression coefficient. 3.4.2 Class weight Class weights were also considered to provide more even probability for all the archetypal control strategies. In the post-cluster data set, some cluster groups contain a large number of members, and other clusters may have only one or two outlier control profiles. Class weighting can be applied to balance the probability for all the cluster groups. First, the total number of cluster groups and individual control profiles found in the training model are observed to calculate the equal probability for all the groups. Then, the weight for each solution case in each cluster group is estimated as following Eq. (13)\u2013(14), (13) P = N c l / N t s (14) w c = P / N c s where P is the equal probability for all the cluster groups, N cl is the number of the cluster groups found in the training model, N ts is the total number of solutions, and N c s is the number of solution in each cluster c group. Thus, a cluster group with frequent solutions could put a lower weight on each solution in the group. On the other hand, the minor or outlier control patterns could impose a higher weight on them. 4 Simulation experiments Simulation case studies were performed to evaluate the capabilities of the proposed rule-extraction method for building cooling setpoint temperature control. A simulation study was performed using the detailed EnergyPlus model described in Section 3.1, as a building emulator. Fig. 5 highlights the process of the case study in this work. First, we performed the MCDA analysis with the Pareto-fronts from the multi-objective optimization. As a result, all the solutions are ranked based on the PROMETHEE II algorithm, and the optimal solution, which is ranked 1st from the MCDA, is called OPT in this study. The OPT case represents the \u201cbest\u201d control performance achieved by running the detailed MPC platform. And the subset of the PREF solutions is selected on the condition that the Pareto-fronts are ranked within 15 from the top and does not have any total demand penalty values. In order to cluster 20 to 30 archetypal control strategies, we performed two-stage DBSCAN clustering. For the decision tree, five different classification models were built; the Normal case represents the classification model without balancing the data set. Linear classification model is using the linear case weighting on the data set, EXP classification model is applying the exponential case weighting for the decision tree, Class classification model represents the model applied the class weight method. Additionally, we also included the TOP classification model that is trained using only the archetypal control strategies which are ranked the 1st from MCDA analysis. Thus, the data set used to build TOP is the averaged control patterns which are not the same as the original optimal solution (OPT). The performance of the simplified rule sets of the decision tree model were then quantified with the testing period through simulation experiment. Each day of the testing period selects one of the archetypal operating strategies following the developed decision trees. The selected daily control strategy was loaded as the operating schedule for simulation day in the building test-bed. Then, the cost values of total demand, comfort penalty, energy consumption, energy cost, energy penalty, chiller penalty, and early start extra penalty functions were calculated based on the simulation output file. In this study, EnergyPlus was utilized as a simulation test-bed. The case study was performed for July 2013. We utilized the 2nd week and 4th week of July for the training data set and the rest days as the testing period. The results of the classification models were compared with the default control strategy NSU and the optimal solution from MCDA OPT (rank = 1). 5 Case study results To illustrate the data set modifications and resulting model performance we present the results for each intermediate step throughout the overall process in the subsections below. 5.1 Subset with PROMETHEE II multi-criteria decision analysis Fig. 6 illustrates representative results of the independent variables belonging to the objective functions from multi-criteria decision analysis. The objective functions of the MCDA chosen in Fig. 6 are energy consumption C econsum , comfort penalty C comfort , and the sum of cost values C total (energy cost, energy penalty, chiller penalty, and early start extra penalty). Y-axis represents the energy consumption in the left subfigure and comfort penalty in right subfigure. X-axis denotes the C total . Variables are shown related to the objective function values of the X, Y-axis. The blue dots denote the optimal solutions (OPT) from the MCDA, the grey dots represent all the non-dominated solutions (Pareto-fronts) from the multi-objective optimization, and the red dots are the selected PREF optimal solutions which were ranked in the top 15 by the MCDA. It was observed that the sum of cost values C total of all the solutions has a linear relationship with energy consumption. The PREF solutions (PREF) and optimal solutions (OPT) are having low energy consumption among all non-dominated solutions. The relationship between the comfort penalty and the sum of cost values C total does not represent any concrete pattern. Some of the optimal solutions (OPT) show very low comfort penalties, and the PREF solutions have a wide range of comfort penalty values. In later sections we will provide more clarity on how to interpret these comfort values. 5.2 DBSCAN clustering Fig. 7 shows the daily profiles (grey solid line) of all the PREF optimal solutions over the time of a day. Each line represents one single control profile of the optimal solutions. It was observed that there are repetitive common control patterns and a few outliers due to specific days of the week, unusual schedules, or pre-cooling. 30 clusters were created using DBSCAN, and archetypal control strategies representing the clusters are illustrated in Fig. 8 . Therefore, the 465 PREF optimal solutions were simplified to 30 archetypal control strategies. Fig. 9 shows the daily breakdown of the clusters over the days of the week. It was observed that there are typical cluster groups for weekdays and weekends. Especially, only one control pattern (cluster number 4) was assigned for Sunday and cluster number 6 was almost always used on Saturdays. As shown in Fig. 8, the cluster number 4 control strategy shows the OFF condition of cooling operation so that the setpoint temperature remains at the initial value, and 7 represents a fairly constant temperature setpoint with a shortened occupancy period. In addition, it shows that the cluster 1 strategy frequently shows up on many weekdays. Fig. 10 describes the number of days in the clusters during the entire optimization period. It confirmed that the cluster 1 was the most frequent pattern. The control profile of cluster 1 is to operate cooling mostly from 6:00 to 17:00 within the range of 25\u201327 °C. On the other hand, it can be seen that this result is disproportionately weighted on cluster number 1, and this highlights that the data set may be imbalanced. Other than the most frequent control pattern, various outlier control patterns were selected as potential control strategies. For instance, cluster 17, one of the outlier patterns, is operating pre-cooling for the building from the very early morning. Such outlier patterns are very important for achieving the desired performance under certain disturbance patterns (e.g., extreme or sustained periods of high ambient temperatures). Thus, the simplified rules must be able to effectively predict both the correct utilization of dominant and outlier control patterns. 5.3 Classification model Figs. 11\u201314 highlight the results of the classification models and the selected the archetypal control strategies. The six predictor variables mentioned in Table 2 were used to build these classification models. Fig. 11 illustrates the classification model of Normal case, which did not apply any case or class weighting on the post-cluster data set. The decision tree model is very simple using only four splits considering days of the week and weather conditions in the previous day as independent variables for the model. Each terminal node contains the decision conditions. First, the model decides based on weekday and weekend. Then, the terminal node on the right side shows that this model suggests specific control strategies for Sunday (cluster number 4) and Saturday (cluster number 6). The cluster number 4 strategy represents the cooling operation is OFF so that the setpoint temperature remains at the initial value over 29 °C. The cluster 6 strategy shows the cooling operation schedule is shorter than weekdays. Thus, it was apparent that this model can correctly select suitable control strategies for weekends. For the weekday conditions, cluster numbers 1 and 18 strategies can be assigned. When the average outdoor temperature in the previous day was below 30.64 °C, the cluster number 1 strategy is set for the cooling operation. If the average outdoor temperature in the previous day was hotter and it is not Wednesday, the cluster number 18 strategy is selected as the operation schedule. As shown in the figure, there is a slight difference between them. The control strategy of cluster number 18 operates the cooling at a lower temperature from the early morning over cluster number 1. When applying case weighting, the decision tree with linear case weighting had the same structure as the Normal case. Therefore, the detailed classification tree for the linear case weighting is omitted from the paper. On the other hand, the structure of the classification model with exponential case weighting was a bit more intricate with six splits and seven different strategies as shown in Fig. 12. First, the model starts by making a decision based on the number of occupants. If the number of occupants is below 49, the cluster number 4 strategy will operate, which is the typical operation for Sunday as we learned from the previous classification model. It was found that having the total number of occupancy below 49 in the whole building, is equivalent to a Sunday operation pattern. If the number of occupants is over 49, the model identifies the operation for Saturday as cluster number 6 strategy by the next terminal node. Then, it classifies the operation for weekdays based on the average outdoor temperature in the previous day. If the average outdoor temperature in the previous day was over 31.01 °C, the cluster 10 strategy is assigned, and if it is between 30.64 °C and 31.01 °C, the cluster 18 strategy will operate. The cluster number 10 operates pre-cooling at a lower temperature than the cluster number 18. Additionally, when the average outdoor temperature of the previous day was below 30.64 °C, the cluster number 0 and 1 strategies can be set for the cooling operation. In general, comparing to the Normal case, the control strategies during weekdays had more diversity depending on the design factors. Fig. 13 shows the classification tree with the class weighting model (Class), which is the most complicated model, although still very interpretable, with 9 splits and 10 different control strategies. Since it gave equal probability to all the cluster groups, more control strategy options were selected in the model. The first decision of this model is decided by the number of occupants. After checking if the number of occupants is below 385, the next node sees whether it is Sunday or not. Thus, it can be assumed that the 385 occupants from the first root node condition were to decide control strategy for the weekend condition or weekday condition. Therefore, cluster number 4 is assigned for Sunday, and the cluster number 5 is set for Saturday. Compared to previous models, the cluster number 5 strategy is chosen for Saturday to operate at 24 °C from 7 a.m. to 12 p.m. The operating schedule shows that it could be a typical control strategy for Saturday due to operating hours. Then, the model decides the operation for weekdays based on a variety of design factors including current, future weather conditions, days of the week, and past building thermal conditions. It was observed that control strategies can be decided based on the simple temperature difference. For example, if the average building temperature in the previous day was higher than 29.1 °C, the model recommends operating control strategy with cluster number 15, which starts pre-cooling with lower setpoint temperature than cluster number 16 on the other side of the node. This model determines the control strategies based on more detailed conditions and included five outlier patterns as terminal nodes for specific occasions. Additionally, we built a classification model with top-ranked solution cases (TOP) as shown in Fig. 14. This model had six splits with seven archetypal control strategies, which are the same as the EXP case. The conditions of the terminal nodes are even similar to the EXP case. For instance, at the same stage of the terminal node, the condition in the TOP case is whether the number of occupants is over 385 or not, and the condition in the EXP case is whether a weekend or not. From the previous outcome, we understand the condition of 385 occupants is to recognize the weekend condition. Therefore, the meaning of the conditions from both cases was the same. The only difference was the final terminal node. The final condition of the terminal node in the TOP case is based on the past outdoor temperature. Overall, the classification models utilized a subset of the archetypal control strategies. In general, 4\u201310 clusters were selected to build the classification models to operate cooling for the building. It was demonstrated that 4\u20139 conditions contributed to building simple and logical classification rulesets. Figs. 15 and 16 represent the classification results by confusion matrices for the Normal case and Top case. Since 30 clusters were involved to build decision trees, the full confusion matrix has dimensions of 30 rows by 30 columns. However, for the sake of presentation here, we trimmed out the rows/columns that are all zeros and only non-zero portions of the matrix are shown in the figures. It shows that the Normal case had an accuracy of 87.9% and the TOP case had an accuracy of 76.8%. As the class distribution is highly skewed, it might be possible that the Normal case got a high accuracy simply by choosing the majority class. In this regards, the performance analysis is required to assess the rule sets of classification models over the optimal solution, since it is known that these problems can have many solutions with near-equivalent costs. 5.4 Performance analysis of the rule sets Fig. 17 illustrates the performance of the rule sets of the classification models over the optimal solution from the MCDA (OPT, solid navy), the subset of PREF solutions (PREF, boxplot), and the default control setting (NSU, dashed black) by the simulation experiment with the EnergyPlus building model. The top subfigure shows the estimated cost function of comfort penalty C comfort over the training and testing period. The periods filled with yellow color represent the testing period, and others are the training periods. In the top subfigure, the subset of PREF solutions had a wide range of comfort penalties, while there were nearly zero penalties with the default schedule (NSU). The comfort penalties of control strategies from the classification models are mostly located in the lower quartile of the PREF solutions during the testing period. From the middle panel, we can observe that the energy consumption C econsum of the default schedule NSU case is fairly large, with regards to the optimal solutions from multi-objective solutions. The PREF solutions (PREF) have a small range of cost values in every time interval, thus, selecting any of these PREF strategies would almost always lead to notable energy savings over the NSU case. During the testing period, the energy consumption of many of the classification models shows a similar trend as the OPT case as well. The third subfigure illustrates the performance with the sum of cost values C total . The control strategies selected by the classification models performed similarly to the OPT case on most days. The performance of the Class case (solid purple with circles) on the 25th was larger than the performance of the default schedule (NSU), indicating a day when a poor decision was made by the Class model. Overall, Fig. 17 shows that several of the classification models made decisions that led to energy use and cost values that were very near the detailed MPC (i.e., OPT) case, with some differences appearing in the comfort objective. Table 3 highlights the overall result of objective costs (C comfort , C econsum , C total ) during the testing period. Fig. 18 provides a visual summary of the data in Table 3 for easier comparison. First, looking the NSU case (grey bars) shows that it had the lowest value for the comfort penalty C comfort , but had the highest energy consumption C econsum and cost value C total . Since the NSU case is the reference case, the energy penalty and early start penalty should be zero, however, the energy cost component of the NSU case was much higher than the other cases. Comparing the NSU to the OPT (medium blue bars) shows that substantial cost and energy savings were found by the detailed MPC platform, with a slight increase in the comfort penalty objective. Comparing the energy and cost performance between the OPT case and the classification models shows that many of the simplified rule sets achieved values very close to the detailed MPC. One primary difference that is observed among the classification models is in the comfort penalty values. To more clearly illustrate the differences, Fig. 19 highlights the percentage change in comfort penalty C comfort , energy consumption C econsum , and the sum of cost values C total relative to the optimal solution (OPT). Each section of the figure illustrates performances of the default schedule (NSU, grey bar), archetypal control strategies (Cluster, white bar with hatch), and the various classification models. The Cluster case represents the performance change due to the clustering step, while the classification model cases represent the combined effect of clustering and classification model prediction accuracy. The original control strategy (NSU, grey bar) showed a negative percentage error for comfort penalty, which means it had improved indoor comfort over the optimal solution (OPT). However, the energy consumption and other penalty values were more than 100% higher. This means the default schedule may operate the HVAC system inefficiently even though it may provide slightly better comfort during some hours. With the archetypal control strategies after clustering (white bar with hatch), the comfort penalty increased three times more than the OPT case, however, the energy consumption and other cost functions were close to the optimal solution. The performance of the classification models varied depending on the feature of weights. The ruleset of the Normal case (red bar) had about 338.3% higher comfort penalty, 8.1% reduced energy consumption, and 13.9% reduced C total compared to the OPT case. The EXP case (green bar) had about 90.8% difference with OPT in the comfort penalty, which is a significant reduction from Normal case, while having only 3.8% higher energy consumption and 13.7% higher C total compared to OPT case. For the Class case (purple bar), the comfort penalty was about 184.6% higher, energy consumption was 2.2% higher, and C total was 19.3% higher. The comfort penalty of the TOP (orange bar) case was 218.2% higher than the OPT case. This is because the performance for thermal comfort was decreased as the original control strategies were averaged to the archetypal control strategy. Its energy consumption was about 1.6% lower and C total was about 2.4% higher than the OPT case. Overall, it was observed that there were trade-offs among the conflicting objectives. The rule sets from the decision trees tended to select strategies that saved energy at slightly higher values of the comfort objective. Figs. 20 and 21 show the detailed building simulation results for testing periods (2nd week and 4th week of July) to better evaluate the indoor comfort, building temperatures, and setpoint temperature changes compared to the NSU and OPT cases. The top subfigure represents the average zone temperature when each control strategy is applied for simulation days, and the second subfigure describes the setpoint temperature of the control strategies. It was observed that the optimal control (OPT, solid navy) operated pre-cooling on Monday (07/08) and Wednesday (07/10) in Fig. 20, and operated with reduced hours on Saturday (07/13). Several of the classification rules followed a similar pattern as the OPT case. For example, the control strategies from the EXP case (solid green with circles) correctly implemented a pre-cooling strategy on Monday and Wednesday. The other classification models missed the precooling strategy on one or both of these days, partially leading to their inferior overall performance. The third subfigure shows the occupancy weighted average PMV (OWA PMV). The light purple area illustrates the recommended thermal limit (between −0.5 and 0.5) from ASHRAE 55 standard. It was observed that the PMV of the NSU case was almost always below zero during the daily operation, signaling that the NSU strategy keeps the building on the cooler side. The OPT case and the majority of the classification models showed PMVs greater than zero but below 0.5, except the end of operation schedule. As it turns off the cooling, the OWA PMV tended to increase. The fact that the PMV values are almost always in the range of zero to 0.5 for many of the models provides an important insight to help interpret the comfort penalty values shown earlier on. Even though the comfort penalty values were noted to be different in earlier results, many of these models lead to very similar comfort as the OPT case. In addition, in Fig. 21 it can also be seen why the EXP case had higher energy consumption than other cases on July 22. The control strategy of the EXP case was operating pre-cooling strategy with an even lower set temperature than other cases on that day. Moreover, the optimal solution (OPT) operated on the 22nd was one of the outlier patterns, and the Class case (solid purple with circles) correctly selected a similar control pattern. From this result, it was demonstrated that including the outlier patterns for rule extraction was helpful in achieving performance close to the optimal solution for the specific occasions. Even though the TOP class showed lower accuracy than the Normal class when comparing the performance from the confusion matrix, the energy consumption differences were less than 3% compared with the optimal solutions and it had better performance in terms of comfort over the Normal case. Therefore, we observed that the classification model has the ability to form a decision tree leading the cluster having similar control pattern as the optimal control strategy. It means that the performance can be nearly optimal even though it had lower accuracy at the confusion matrix. We demonstrated it by implementing in the building emulator. Overall, the detailed building simulation results support the findings in the previous section. It was demonstrated that the rulesets were able to operate very close to the optimal solution in terms of energy savings, cost savings, and thermal comfort for occupants. 6 Conclusion This paper introduced a rule extraction method from detailed multi-objective MPC solutions for building HVAC control that combined multi-criteria decision analysis, control strategy clustering, and classification tree models. A set of archetypal control strategies was extracted from DBSCAN clustering including outlier patterns for unique and influential conditions. In addition to that, different weighting processes have been applied for the imbalanced data set to give more opportunities for outlier patterns. Using easily observable predictor variables, decision trees were constructed to identify near-optimal control strategies for each day. The performance of the extracted rule sets was evaluated with respect to the default schedule and optimal solution from detailed MPC. The comparable overall performance among the classification models showed that the models can select suitable control strategies depending on the weather condition, occupancy, thermal history of the building, and the day of the week. This work also demonstrated that outlier control strategies are important due to random variation or high impact on operational performance. Running multi-objective MPC took approximately 5 h to schedule control strategy for 1 day (24 h), however, we could reduce the computational time significantly to less than 1 s with the proposed scheme. Even though we need offline training to build the online platform, we can easily make a decision and reproduce the similar behavior with a very fast decision once we set up the control decision tree. Overall, this work demonstrated that the proposed rule extraction method is simple to understand, fast, can easily extract the interpretable results and makes a simple decision while maintaining indoor thermal comfort to occupants as well as efficient operation for building HVAC systems. The study's major findings are as follows: First, the best rule sets were able to achieve 95\u201397% of the energy savings and 89\u201392% of the cost objective savings of the fully detailed MPC controller, despite the dramatically simpler form. Second, the average of occupant weighted PMV was 0.425\u20130.492, which was within the recommended thermal limits during most of the operating hours when the control strategies were applied to the building emulator testbed. Third, the methods proposed in this work were able to strategically reduce the original MPC data set of 465 preferred strategies to 4\u20139 archetypal strategies that could achieve near-optimal performance. Forth, when the ruleset was with 4 decision nodes without any case or class weighting on the post-cluster data set, it operated 8% of energy-saving strategy over the optimal solution, however, it did not operate for Saturday. Therefore, it was confirmed that overly simplified models might not perform well on occasions where precooling may be necessary (e.g., peak days). Last, when the ruleset had a moderate complexity with 6\u20139 decision nodes with the appropriate class or case weighting, the outlier pattern received greater consideration, along with high-ranked solutions. The classification model with exponential case weighting showed a relatively similar control pattern to the optimal solution when precooling was required, thus, it achieved only a 3% difference in energy consumption. 7 Discussion and recommendation for future research This section identifies several challenges and limitations in this study, suggesting possible future work. First, more expansive predictor variables for the classification model can be investigated to recognize the specific occasion and improve the performance. For example, the average value of time-varying predictor variables used in this work can be subdivided into separate time intervals to represent more tailored control strategies. Second, the effectiveness of the proposed method can be verified with a more diverse set of building types and control scenarios. This work is limited to the building model that we used for this study. This method can be applied to different HVAC system configurations. For example, we can extract control rules for boiler heating operations. We could also apply the proposed method to control not just temperature, but also air or water flow rate. Third, future work could explore transfer, calibration, and adaptation of rules to other buildings, to further capitalize on the simplicity of the rules. Substantial computational and deployment savings can be achieved if the full rule-extraction process does not have to be repeated for each building. Last, the proposed control strategies would be implemented at the top level of the Building Automation System (BAS) as hourly supervisory zone temperature setpoint changes. The BAS is used to supervise the operations of HVAC systems, and distribute setpoints to each zone-level DDC controller. Each local level controller is placed and is able to modulate the control at each level accordingly. PI/PID (proportional integral/proportional integral derivative) controllers have been most commonly used in HVAC systems, and it has the ability to keep controlled variables close to setpoint values within the prescribed range. This work is limited in that there is no uncertainty and no mismatch between control strategy and actual operation. Future work can explore how the uncertainties in actual operation could affect the performance.

        "dc:description": "Developing intelligent building control strategies is increasingly becoming a multi-objective problem as owners, occupants, and operators seek to balance performance across energy, operating expense, environmental concerns, indoor environmental quality, and electric grid incentives. Implementing multi-objective optimal controls in buildings is challenging and often not tractable due to the complexity of the problem and the computational burden that frequently accompanies such optimization problems. In this work, we extract near-optimal rule sets from a database of non-dominated solutions, created by applying multi-objective model predictive control to detailed EnergyPlus models. We first apply multi-criteria decision analysis to rank the non-dominated solutions and select a subset of consistent and plausible operating strategies that can satisfy operator or occupant preferences. Next, unsupervised clustering is applied to highlight recurring control patterns. In the final step, we build a supervised classification model to identify the right optimal temperature control patterns for a particular day. The performance of the simplified rule sets is then quantified through simulation. Despite the dramatically simpler form, the best rule sets were able to achieve 95\u201397% of the energy savings and 89\u201392% of the cost objective savings of the fully detailed model predictive controller, while achieving similar thermal comfort and peak electrical demand.",
