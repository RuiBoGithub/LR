Mixed-mode (MM) buildings reduce air conditioning (AC) energy consumption while maintaining indoor thermal comfort through the appropriate use of natural ventilation (NV). The objective of this investigation was to propose a method to determine the best NV operation range suitable for MM buildings and further to propose a change-over control strategy. First, the usual natural ventilation operating range (NV-range) was obtained based on the upper and lower comfort temperature limits of the adaptive comfort model. The usual NV-range was extended by adding threshold conditions, and then, it was divided into nine natural ventilation operation subranges (NVOSs). Second, the comfort and energy performance of each NVOS were analyzed through a co-simulation for an MM office building in Xi'an, China, as an example to obtain the optimal NV-range for the local climate. The results showed that the proposed optimal NV-range reduced the number of discomfort hours by 248.33 h while increasing the energy savings by 13.29% compared to those of the commonly used NV-ranges. Finally, the control scheme with the adaptive comfort model changed to the PMV model (ACM-PMV-CS) with the addition of a 1.5-h transition period was proposed in order to solve the problem of using the steady-state PMV model directly in the AC mode under the frequent switching conditions between the NV and AC modes. The results showed that ACM-PMV-1.5 h transition period resulted in a reduction in the number of discomfort hours (248.33 h) and a 35.46% increase in the energy savings compared to those of ACM-PMV-CS without a transition period.

Heating ventilation air conditioning (HVAC) is the largest energy consumer in commercial and residential buildings [2], providing heating, cooling, and ventilation. People spend about 80% of their lives in buildings [3], and indoor discomfort can also affect human health and work efficiency. Therefore, many scientists have been researching methods to reduce HVAC energy consumption as much as possible to ensure thermal comfort. Mixed-mode (MM) ventilation combines natural ventilation (NV) with conventional mechanical heating and cooling systems [4,5]. The goal is to use as much free cooling generated by outdoor air as possible to minimize HVAC energy consumption [6\u20138] while using mechanical cooling to maintain indoor thermal comfort when outdoor conditions are not suitable [9]. The key to determining the energy efficiency of MM buildings is the timely switching of the window opening and closing states in response to changes in the indoor and outdoor environment [10]. However, the conditions that determine when windows should be operated are unclear [11]. Therefore, it is necessary to control the window statuses of MM buildings. According to the classification of MM building control strategies [12], the control strategy that switches between the NV mode and the air conditioning (AC) mode is called \u201cchange-over.\u201d The first key question for the MM building control strategy is how to develop NV mode thresholds applicable to the local climate. Research has shown that indoor and outdoor temperatures are essential factors in determining the effectiveness of NV, and the outdoor temperature and operative temperature are formulated as two-dimensional threshold conditions, which can also be referred to as the natural ventilation operation range (NV-range) [13]. The horizontal and vertical coordinates represent the outdoor temperature and operative temperature, respectively, and the temperature range that satisfies the threshold conditions is the NV-range. The NV threshold setting methods can be divided into fixed-threshold methods and variable-threshold methods. Duan et al. [14] used a fixed -threshold method to set the outdoor temperature ( ∈ (12,28)°C) and indoor temperature ( ∈ (22,26)°C) as the NV mode threshold. However, the optimal outdoor temperature conditions for the NV mode largely depend on seasonal variations [15], and thus, the control effect of this fixed-threshold method may not be satisfactory [16]. In addition, scholars have begun to study variable-threshold methods, where the threshold needs to be adjusted periodically based on outdoor climate changes. The daily changing comfort temperature limit is calculated by the adaptive thermal comfort model, and the NV-range is updated daily [16\u201324]. Aguilera et al. [24] proposed a variable-threshold MM building control strategy based on an adaptive comfort model. They simulated it using weather data from five regions. The results showed that the variable-threshold control strategy reduced the energy consumption by 20% in warm and humid climatic regions such as Palermo and Tokyo. In recent years, a number of studies [25\u201328] have compared the advantages of variable thresholds over fixed thresholds to show that the development of variable-threshold conditions for the NV mode based on the adaptive comfort model is a practical approach for energy conservation. However, the climatic conditions of the regions covered by the previous studies varied widely, and no consensus has been reached on how to further specify the NV-range of MM buildings beyond the upper and lower limits of the adaptive comfort model. Fiorentini et al. [22] directly composed the adaptive comfort model's upper and lower temperature limits as the NV-range, a regular square that was updated over time. Some studies added other threshold conditions, such as requiring the outdoor temperature to be greater than the indoor operating temperature [13,24], and some studies extended the lower limit of the outdoor temperature threshold to more fully utilize NV, such as requiring that NV be allowed when the outdoor temperature is <3 °C below the lower limit of the comfort temperature [13]. Previous studies were specific to different regions, so they developed different NV-range. The second key question for the control strategy of MM buildings is how to preferentially select control schemes of different thermal comfort models for the NV and AC modes of MM buildings. There are two classical models for thermal comfort evaluation. One is the predicted mean vote (PMV) model proposed by Fanger [29], which has been widely used for thermal comfort evaluation in steady-state environments. The other is the adaptive comfort model proposed by Humphreys et al. [30], which can predict the indoor comfort temperature from the outdoor temperature and is mainly used to evaluate NV buildings with a large number of adaptation possibilities. The two classical thermal comfort models mentioned above have been applied to develop MM building change-over control strategies with the following three schemes: 1) control schemes based on PMV (PMV-CS), where the PMV model is used for the NV and AC modes. However, it was demonstrated in an MM building thermal comfort model applicability study that there was a significant discrepancy between the PMV-CS result and the actual thermal sensation of the occupants [31] and that some of the operative temperature ranges would overestimate the occupants' thermal sensation. Therefore, the use of this scheme to develop the change-over control strategy for MM buildings is not considered in this paper. 2) Control schemes based on the adaptive comfort model (ACM-CS), NV and AC modes all use the adaptive comfort model. An ACM-CS can more accurately express the actual thermal sensation of the human body than a PMV-CS, and ACM-CS have been used in some studies in the development of control strategies for MM buildings [13,16,18,20], as well as in the European standard EN 16798 [32], which also suggests that the evaluation of the thermal comfort of MM model buildings can be achieved using this type of scheme. However, some studies have suggested that the adaptive capacity of occupants in automatically controlled MM buildings is limited [33], and it is possible that an ACM-CS needs to be used in specific modes or within a certain temperature range [34]. 3) Control schemes based on adaptive comfort models changed to PMV (ACM-PMV-CSs), which use the adaptive comfort model for the NV mode and the PMV model when converted to the AC mode. Fiorentini et al. [22] used this scheme to develop a control strategy for MM buildings, and the Chinese standard GB/T 50785 [35] and ASHRAE standard 55\u20132020 [36] also recommend this scheme to evaluate the indoor thermal environment. However, MM buildings may frequently switch between the NV and AC modes, and it must be determined whether it is appropriate to directly use the steady-state PMV model for AC mode evaluation and control in dynamic environments. In summary, timely switching between NV and AC modes based on the indoor and outdoor environment changes is the key to determining the energy consumption of MM buildings. Developing a variable -threshold NV-range for MM buildings based on the adaptive comfort model is an effective way to save energy. Nonetheless, it is clear from the literature [13,22\u201324] that the NV-range developed in different regions are not the same, and replicating the NV-range from other regions does not guarantee the optimal energy-saving effect. Is it necessary for MM buildings in Xi'an to switch to the PMV model for indoor environment evaluation and control in the AC mode, and it remains to be determined how to develop a control strategy to solve the problem that the dynamic AC mode is unsuitable for steady-state PMV under frequent switching conditions. Based on this, the main contributions of this study are as follows: 1. A method for developing an optimal NV operation range for MM buildings has been proposed. First, to fully utilize NV, the expansion threshold conditions were combined in this study to expand the usual NV-range (upper and lower temperature limits of adaptive comfort models). To further ensure thermal comfort, the expanded NV-range was refined into nine natural ventilation operation subranges (NVOSs), and the comfort and energy performance of each NVOS were analyzed and compared to determine the optimal NV-range. Furthermore, the NV-range optimization method is applied to the typical cities of Xi'an (cold), Harbin (bitter cold), Shanghai (hot summer and cold winter), Kunming (temperate), and Guangzhou (hot summer and warm winter), which are typical cities in five climate zones in China. 2. A change-over control strategy for MM buildings in Xi'an was developed. First, the MM buildings in Xi'an had high outdoor temperatures during the daytime in summer, which often results in a long duration of the AC mode, so it is more appropriate to consider the use of the PMV model for the AC mode and select the ACM-PMV-CS scheme to develop a control strategy. Furthermore, to avoid the problem that the dynamic AC mode directly adopts the steady-state PMV under frequent switching conditions, the ACM-PMV control strategy with an increased transition period was proposed. 2 Description of case study The programs for analyzing MM buildings operational frameworks is shown in Fig. 1 Section 2 describes the established model in detail (Step 1); Section 3 introduces the method of dividing the NVOSs (Step2) and the optimal NV-range in Xi'an (Step3); Section 4 introduces the control strategy applicable to MM buildings in Xi'an (Step4). Xi'an is located in the cold climate zone of China. The outdoor temperature has significant seasonal variations, as shown in Fig. 2 , and the effective time of NV is more than 20% [37]. Therefore, an MM office building in Xi'an was considered as an example in this study, and the transition season and summer (March 15 to November 15) were selected as the study period. The typical meteorological year data used in this study were from \u201cA Fundamental Data Sharing Platform for Building Energy Efficiency.\u201d [38,39]. Referring to a university office building in Xi'an, China, the west-oriented middle floor room was selected as the research object, and the simplified model was built in Sketchup, as shown in Fig. 3 The area of the office was 141.12 m2, and the building envelope and interior heat sources were designed according to the Chinese standard GB/T 50189 [40]. The number of office occupants was 30, with occupancy hours from 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. The occupant metabolic rate and clothing thermal resistance were estimated and set in Energyplus according to ASHRAE 55\u20132020 [36]. Fig. 4 shows the co-simulation flow of Energyplus and Python. First, a simplified model of the building, HVAC, and NV was created in Energyplus. The HVAC model is the ideal load air system in Energyplus, and the natural ventilation model is built from the airflow network external node. The office had four windows of the same area facing west, each of which had an operational area of 30% and performed the same operational action when controlled. Second, a co-simulation platform was established using Python and Energyplus. Specifically, using the external interface functionality in Energyplus, the .idf files created by Energyplus were converted to .fmu files readable by pyfmi via EnergyPlusToFMU. The model in Energyplus and the control program in Python exchanged data in steps of 10 min. Energyplus output real-time parameters to Python, which were processed by the Python control program to obtain the optimal window switching action and AC setpoint temperature at the current moment. The Energyplus model performed the actions to obtain the environmental parameters at the next moment. 3 Optimized natural ventilation (NV) operation range 3.1 Variable thresholds based on adaptive comfort model Based on the ASHRAE 55\u20132020 [36] standard for comfort temperatures for adaptive comfort models, the upper 80% acceptability limit (Tcom_ul) and the lower 80% acceptability limit (Tcom_ll) were calculated with respect to the prevailing mean outdoor air temperature (Tpma): (1) T pma − n = 1 \u2010 α t od − 1 + α t od − 2 + α 2 t od − 3 + ⋯ + α n − 1 t od − n where t od − n is the average outdoor temperature for n days prior to the evaluation date, and the standard specifies that the value of n taken should not be <7 days and not >30 days; in this study, n was taken as 7 days. The standard recommended α values range from 0.6 to 0.9, and Xi'an was located in the mid-latitude. Thus, α was assumed to be 0.6 [41]. Unlike the fixed comfort temperature threshold based on the PMV model, Tcom_ul (Eq. 2), Tcom_ll (Eq. 3), and the comfort temperature (Tcom) (Eq. 4) of the adaptive comfort model varied with Tpma, as shown in Fig. 5 . (2) T com _ ul = 0.31 T pma − n + 21.3 (3) T com _ ll = 0.31 T pma − n + 14.3 (4) T com = T com _ ul + T com _ ll / 2 3.2 Dividing NV operation subranges(NVOSs) To fully utilize NV to reduce the energy consumption of AC, this study added threshold conditions such as the upper limit of the operative temperature (Top_ul) and the lower limit of the outdoor temperature (Tout_ll) to expand the usual NV-range based on the adaptive comfort model. Based on previous studies on the setting of NV-range for MM buildings [13,22,24] (Fig. 6 ) and the comfort evaluation of MM buildings [31,42], Top_ul was set to 32 °C and Tout_ll was set to 12 °C. The NV operating range was refined into nine operation subranges (NVOSs) using Tcom, Tcom_ul, Tcom_ll, Top_ul, and Tout_ll as thresholds. As shown in Fig. 7 , for the division of nine NVOSs, Tout was divided into three segments, OC, OCC, and OCH, with Tcom, Tcom_ul, Tcom_ll, and Tout_ll as thresholds. Then, Top was also divided into three segments, ICC, ICH, and IH, with Tcom, Tcom_ul, Tcom_ll, and Top_ul as thresholds. Next, Tout and Top, which allow for NV, were combined, resulting in a total of nine NVOSs, (OC, OCC, OCH) × (ICC, ICH, IH), which could be flexibly combined to obtain the optimal NV range for the Xi'an area. 3.3 Performance comparison of NVOSs This section analyzes the thermal comfort, energy saving potential, and specific sources of discomfort caused by NV for the nine NVOSs mentioned in Section 3.2. The expanded subranges NVOS-5, NVOS-6, and NVOS-9 were obtained by adding the threshold condition Top-ul, and NV was allowed if Top was higher than Tcom_ul. Therefore, combining the expanded NVOS with the usual NVOS-3, NVOS-7, and NVOS-2 was more reasonable. Non-NV relied only on the AC system to regulate the indoor temperature, so it had the best comfort situation for the people in the room, and it was used as the baseline case to compare the performances with other NVOSs. The flowchart of the NV-range optimization method is shown in Fig. 8 . The details of the simulation comparison cases in this section are shown in Table 1 . 3.3.1 Discomfort degree hours and energy performance Table 2 shows that NVOS-2 and NVOS-29 had more hot discomfort hours in spring and summer, and NVOS-8 had more cold discomfort hours in fall. Fig. 9 shows that NVOS-3 and NVOS-7 had significant energy savings and fewer discomfort hours. The other cases (NVOS-1, NVOS-4, NVOS-35, and NVOS-76) had good comfort but no significant energy savings. 3.3.2 Analysis of reasons for discomfort To illustrate the reason why NVOS-2 caused more hours of hot discomfort in spring and summer, this section analyzes and compares NVOS-2&3 and NVOS-3 based on 24 h of operation on May 3 as an example. As shown in Fig. 10 , the outdoor temperature fluctuated between 14 and 25 °C on May 3. NVOS-3 allowed NV when Tout was lower than Tcom (11 a.m.\u20131 p.m. and 7 p.m.\u201310 p.m.), and the windows were closed to use AC to cool the room when Tout was higher than Tcom (1 p.m.\u20137 p.m.), which in this case kept Top well within the comfortable temperature range. The most significant difference between NVOS-2&3 and NVOS-3 was that Top floated at Tcom_ul from 14 p.m. to 19 p.m. and exceeded Tcom_ul at multiple moments, increasing the number of hot discomfort hours. When Top was higher than Tcom_ul, it was necessary to close the window for AC cooling; when Top was lower than Tcom_ul, satisfying the NV operation range, it was necessary to open the window for ventilation. The result was an NV and AC alternating operation. NVOS-2&3 not only increased the indoor hot discomfort time but also adversely affected the life of the AC system. Therefore, NV is not recommended when both Tout and Top are high (e.g., NVOS-2 and NVOS-9). To illustrate the reason why NVOS-8 caused more cold discomfort hours in fall, NVOS-7&8 and NVOS-7 were compared based on 24 h of operation on September 26 as an example. As shown in Fig. 11 , Tout fluctuated in the range of 11\u201315 °C, and the overall Tout was below Tcom_ll. However, Non-NV still required AC cooling during the daytime to keep the indoor temperature near Tcom. NVOS-7 maintained indoor temperatures within the comfort temperature range through short periods of intermittent NV during the day. NVOS-7&8 caused Top to remain at Tcom-ll, with some cold discomfort hours, and caused the NV and AC heating to run intermittently. Thus, NVOS-8 was prone to increasing cold discomfort time. 3.4 Best NV-range for Xi'an Based on the results in Section 3.3, NVOS-3 and NVOS-7, which provide significant energy savings and good comfort, were combined as NV-range-3, as shown in Fig. 12(c). NVOS-2, NVOS-8, and NVOS-9, which were not suitable for NV, were excluded to obtain NV-range-4, as shown in Fig. 12(d). The NV-range proposed in this paper was not exactly the same those as in previous studies, which were set as the control groups NV-range-1 and NV-range-2, as shown in Fig. 12(a) and (b), respectively . With non-NV used as the baseline case, for the simulated cases discussed in this section, the threshold setting of NV was different, and all other settings were the same. The set AC mode heating temperature was Tcom_ll + 3 °C, and the set cooling temperature was Tcom_ul-3 °C. 3.4.1 Analysis of daytime operation In Fig. 13 , the red and blue triangles represent the Top values of hot and cold discomfort, respectively, and the green scatter points represent the Top values of the NV periods. The comparison with Non-NV showed that all four NV-range could significantly reduce the duration of AC cooling by NV while exacerbating the hot and cold discomfort. NV-range-1 resulted in significant increases in the hot discomfort time and the indoor temperature (Tin) during May 1\u2013September 31, mainly due to the inclusion of NVOS-2 in NV-range-1. In contrast, NV-range-2 produced the highest number of cold discomfort hours, with significantly more cold discomfort hours in spring and fall compared to those in Non-NV, mainly because NV-range-2 contained NVOS-8. The proposed NV-range-3 and NV-range-4 significantly reduced the AC cooling time by NV during spring and fall, keeping Tin and Top in the comfort temperature range for the majority of the time. There were only small increases in the hot and cold discomfort times compared to those in Non-NV, and there were significant reductions in the hot and cold discomfort times compared to those in NV-range-1 and NV-range-2, which were commonly used in previous studies. 3.4.2 NV distribution time period Fig. 14 shows radar plots with the axes representing the NV operation times, hot discomfort times, and cold discomfort times for each time period throughout the day, with the center representing 0 h and the hours increasing moving toward the edge. As shown in Fig. 14(a), in NV-range-1, the NV times in summer were mainly concentrated in the ranges of 8\u201311 a.m. and 7\u20139 p.m., and the total NV time in summer was 460.83 h, while the total hot discomfort time was 224.33 h. It was observed that the distribution of hot discomfort hours in summer was very similar in shape to the distribution of NV hours, suggesting that the use of NV-range-1 could lead to an increase in the number of hot discomfort hours in summer. As shown in Fig. 14(b), NV-range-2 had a much longer duration of NV in spring and fall than the other cases, which also resulted in a higher number of cold discomfort hours in spring and fall, with values of 31.5 and 57.5 h, respectively. This case had a significant increase in the summer night NV time and a relative decrease in the hot discomfort time compared to those of NV-range-1. Fig. 14(c) and (d) shows the results for NV-range-3 and NV-range-4 proposed in this paper, where the discomfort time was significantly reduced compared to those of NV-range-1 and NV-range-2. In particular, in summer, the hot discomfort hours were mainly concentrated at 8 a.m., mainly because the air conditioner was allowed to run at 8 a.m., and Top could not be reduced to a comfortable temperature range within a short time. NV-range-4 increased the NV time in each season compared to NV-range-3. In particular, NV-range-4 significantly increased the NV time in the summer night (10 p.m.\u20137 a.m.) and reduced the indoor temperatures by dramatically increasing the length of night ventilation, and thus, NV-range-4 reduced the hot discomfort at 8 a.m. in summer compared to NV-range-3. In summary, NV-range-4 provided longer NV and better comfort than NV-range-3. 3.4.3 Discomfort degree hours and energy performance The discomfort hours and the energy-saving rates for the four NV-ranges are compared with those of Non-NV in Fig. 15 The numbers of discomfort hours for NV-range-3 and NV-range-4 were 34.67 and 33.17 h, respectively. The energy saves rates were 42.69% and 45.06%, respectively. It is also shown that in addition to NV in NVOS-3 and NVOS-7, where the energy savings were significant (NV-range-3), extending the range of NV allowed (NV-range-4) for better energy performance and comfort results, with an increase of 2.37% in energy savings and a reduction of 1.5 h in discomfort hours. Although there was no significant change in the energy-saving rate of NV-range-4 compared to that of NV-range-2, there was a significant reduction of about 258.5 h in the number of discomfort hours. NV-range-4 reduced the number of discomfort hours by 248.33 h and increased the energy -saving rate by 13.29% compared to those of the commonly used NV-range-1. In summary, NVOS-1, NVOS-3, NVOS-4, NVOS-5, NVOS-6, and NVOS-7 were combined to obtain the optimal NV operating range (NV-range-4) for Xi'an, which provided excellent comfort and energy efficiency. 3.5 Extension and validation of NV range optimization methods In addition to Xi'an (Cold), four other cities located in other climatic zones of China were selected for the study: Harbin (Severe Cold), Shanghai (Hot Summer, Cold Winter), Kunming (Temperate), and Guangzhou (Hot Summer, Warm Winter). The optimized NV-range for different regions can be obtained by following the steps shown in the flowchart as Fig. 16 .The results of comparing the usual NV-range and optimized NV-range for the four regions in terms of energy saving rate and comfort are shown in Table 3 .Harbin and Kunming Optimization of NV-range in Harbin and Kunming leads to an increase in energy savings; the number of discomfort hours is reduced in Shanghai and Guangzhou. 4 Mixed-mode (MM) building control strategy 4.1 Selecting thermal comfort model control scheme Analysis was conducted to determine whether the development of a control strategy for MM buildings in Xi'an requires the conversion of the adaptive thermal comfort model to a PMV model after the conversion of the NV mode to the AC mode. The longest continuous duration of window shutdown (the longest duration of the AC mode) during the daily working hours (8 a.m.\u201310 p.m., 14 h in total) is shown in Fig. 17 The percentage of days in which the AC mode lasted longer than 8 h per day was 50.01%. As shown in the radar chart in Fig. 18 , the longest duration of the AC mode ∈ 14\u20138 h lasted up to about 25 days in summer (June, July, and August), and >60% of the days with the duration of the AC mode ∈ 14\u20138 h occurred in March and November when the outdoor temperatures were cooler. The Top distributions of Non-NV-ACM and Non-NV-PMV are shown in Fig. 19 and the AC heating and cooling temperatures for the two cases were set based on the adaptive comfort model and the PMV model, respectively. In summer (June 1\u2013August 31), the Top values of Non-NV-PMV were mostly in the range of 26\u201328 °C, which is the comfortable temperature range for air-conditioned environments . The Top values of the Non-NV-ACM followed the variation of the Tcom_ul values, which were mostly in the range of 28\u201330 °C, and the overall Top value was about 2 °C higher in summer compared to that of Non-NV-PMV. In summary, due to the high outdoor temperature in summer in Xi'an, there were many days with the AC model ran for a duration of 14\u20138 h. The Top values were still in the higher range of 28\u201330 °C in summer when only relying on the adaptive comfort model to control the AC. Based on the results, ACM-PMV-CS was selected for developing the change-over control strategy for MM buildings in Xi'an. 4.2 NV\u2013AC frequent change-over conditions MM buildings face the problem of frequent switching between NV and AC modes, and whether the PMV model, which is applicable to steady-state AC conditions, can be directly applied to the AC mode for MM buildings needs further discussion. As shown in Fig. 20 , the number of days with more than five transitions between NV and AC was about 39%, especially during the transition season, when there were frequent transitions between the NV and AC modes. To illustrate whether the NV and AC frequent switching situation had an impact on the performance of the ACM-PMV control strategy, the whole day of May 8 was selected for analysis. In Fig. 21 , the line graph in the upper part shows the Top distribution, and the scatter plot in the lower part shows the PMV distribution. The ACM-PMV control strategy allowed windows to be opened and closed at intervals, with open windows resulting in lower indoor temperatures, while closed windows were immediately converted to the PMV model for evaluation and control, resulting in a PMV of less than −1 and a renewed need for AC. Under this control strategy, the Top values fluctuated between 22 and 24 °C, and the PMV values fluctuated between [−1.5,-0.5]. In summary, the frequent switching conditions between the NV and AC modes led to dynamic changes in the indoor temperature, and it was controlled and evaluated by the PMV model immediately after the windows were closed, which could easily lead to the wastage of AC energy consumption. Therefore, the ACM-PMV control strategy must avoid the AC mode directly adopting the PMV for evaluation and control as much as possible under the frequent switching conditions between the NV and AC modes. 4.3 Development of control strategy for MM buildings in Xi'an As shown in Fig. 22 , the longest interval between the two NV modes was 90 min for frequent switching conditions between the NV and AC modes. To avoid the problem of directly using the PMV model, it was necessary to add a transition period (1.5 h) at the end of the NV mode (after the windows were closed), and the transition period was still evaluated and controlled by the adaptive comfort model because the indoor temperature was dynamically changing during the transition period. Based on this, in this section, ACM-PMV-CS is separated into ACM-PMV without a transition period and ACM-PMV-1.5 h with a 1.5-h transition period, and the detailed information of the cases is shown in Table 4 . As shown in Fig. 23 , the discomfort hours of ACM-PMV was 202.67 h, and the energy-saving rate was 18.56% compared to that of Non-NV-PMV; the discomfort hours of ACM-PMV-1.5 h was 49.5 h, and the energy -saving rate was 42.22%. The discomfort hours of ACM-PMV-1.5 h was significantly reduced by 153.17 h, and the energy-saving rate was increased by 23.66% compared to those of the no-transition control strategy, ACM-PMV. 5 Conclusions With MM office building as an example, this study investigates the NV threshold condition setting problem of conversion control strategy for MM building, and selects typical cities in five climate zones in China for simulation verification, as well as the applicability of thermal comfort modeling under the condition of frequent switching between NV and AC modes.Thus, a variable-threshold NV operation range optimization method was proposed for MM buildings, and the ACM-PMV-1.5 h control strategy is applicable to MM buildings in Xi'an. In addition, the comfort and energy efficiency achieved by the optimized NV operation range and change-over control strategy proposed in this paper were also proven by a co-simulation, which provides a reference for the development of change-over control strategies for MM buildings in other regions. The main conclusions are as follows: 1. Under the climatic conditions of Xi'an, NVOS-2 and NVOS-9 may lead to a significant increase in the number of hot discomfort hours in spring and summer. NVOS-8 led to an increase in the number of cold discomfort hours in fall. Based on this, the optimal NV-range-4 was obtained for Xi'an, which reduced the energy consumption by 45.06% compared with that of Non-NV. Furthermore, it reduced the number of discomfort hours by 248.33 h and improved the energy savings by 13.29% compared with those of the commonly used NV-range-1. 2. The ACM-PMV control strategy with an increased transition period of 1.5 h was proposed to avoid the problem that the dynamic AC mode under frequent switching conditions between NV and AC modes may lead to an increase in the AC energy consumption by directly using the steady-state PMV model for evaluation and control. Compared with the no-transition ACM-PMV control strategy, the number of ACM-PMV-1.5 h discomfort hours was reduced by 248.33 h and the energy savings were increased by 35.46%. The AC energy consumption of this control strategy was reduced by 42.22% compared to that of the Non-NV. In this study, it was concluded that a transition period of 1.5 h was required for the transition of the MM building NV mode to the AC mode; after the this period, the AC mode could be used to evaluate and control the indoor environment using the PMV model for the steady-state operating conditions. In summary, the proposed method in this study can reduce air-conditioning energy consumption by more fully utilizing natural ventilation while ensuring thermal comfort, and the method can be replicated for use in other regions without the need for complex programming and calculations. However, in this study, only the simulation of a single orientation of an office building was considered, not buildings of different types and orientations. This is because the focus of this study is to develop optimization methods that can be applied to other regions or other types of buildings by changing the weather data or replacing the building model. In addition, this study used simulation, so it was not possible to assess the subjective thermal comfort of the occupants, and future research should include validation of this mixed-mode building control strategy in a real building.

The objective of this investigation was to propose a method to determine the best NV operation range suitable for MM buildings and further to propose a change-over control strategy. First, the usual natural ventilation operating range (NV-range) was obtained based on the upper and lower comfort temperature limits of the adaptive comfort model. The usual NV-range was extended by adding threshold conditions, and then, it was divided into nine natural ventilation operation subranges (NVOSs). Second, the comfort and energy performance of each NVOS were analyzed through a co-simulation for an MM office building in Xi'an, China, as an example to obtain the optimal NV-range for the local climate. The results showed that the proposed optimal NV-range reduced the number of discomfort hours by 248.33 h while increasing the energy savings by 13.29% compared to those of the commonly used NV-ranges. Finally, the control scheme with the adaptive comfort model changed to the PMV model (ACM-PMV-CS) with the addition of a 1.5-h transition period was proposed in order to solve the problem of using the steady-state PMV model directly in the AC mode under the frequent switching conditions between the NV and AC modes. The results showed that ACM-PMV-1.5 h transition period resulted in a reduction in the number of discomfort hours (248.33 h) and a 35.46% increase in the energy savings compared to those of ACM-PMV-CS without a transition period.",
