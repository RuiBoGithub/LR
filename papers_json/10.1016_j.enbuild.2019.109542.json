Changes in the electricity supply system induce the challenge of matching the highly fluctuating and unpredictable renewable energy generation with the yet inflexible electricity demand. This leads to an increasing demand for energy storage and demand-flexibility. Electrification of residential heating systems in combination with advanced controls utilizing dynamically the structural thermal mass (STM) of buildings as thermal storage could provide some of the required demand flexibility. In this work, a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm is developed and applied within a simulation framework to control dynamic heating operation as a measure of STM based residential load shifting (LS). The self-learning algorithm is functional without extensive measurement data or expert knowledge for parametrization. It optimizes heating operations required for LS according to a dynamic primary energy factor signal, while observing transient thermal comfort constraints. The implemented auto-regressive black-box model with explanatory variables predicts thermal conditions within the observed thermal zone with sufficient quality to support MPC. Based on that model, the control algorithm successfully activates STM as a measure of LS according to the given primary energy (PE) oriented utility function. For the observed system, the PE demand can be reduced by 3\u20137% while maintaining or even improving the thermal comfort.

Due to the current inflexibility of electricity demand, Germany has increasing difficulties to match the renewable energy generation with the electricity demand. The rising share of wind and PV in the total energy portfolio will further aggravate that challenge in the upcoming years [2]. Therefore, there will be an increasing demand for energy storage and demand-flexibility in the imminent future. Space heating of residential buildings is accountable for 18% of Germany\u2019s final energy demand (FED) [3,4] and a similar share is reported for the European Union [5]. Thus, dynamic control of residential heating systems could provide flexibility to counter the imbalances between supply and demand in the electrical grid. Since the heating demand of buildings is inherently not very flexible, thermal storages are required to actually exploit the flexibility potential of residential buildings. For this purpose, either technical storage systems such as hot water tanks can be used [6,7], or the intrinsic structural thermal mass (STM) of buildings could be actively used as a storage [8\u201310]. This work focuses on the latter approach since no dedicated technical storage must be purchased and accommodated within the building when using STM. However, there are several technical, social and energy policy based boundary conditions, which strongly impact the viability and the potential of employing STM as a storage in residential buildings. Technical challenges mainly arise from the required transition from fossil fuel powered heating systems to electricity driven systems as heat pumps (HP) or direct electric heating [11,12]. Additionally, a communication infrastructure between the power grid and the potentially flexible consumers has to be established. Moreover, the energy only market (EOM) currently established in Germany and in other European countries does not provide any motivation for flexible, grid supportive electricity consumption, since customers pay for the consumed energy regardless of the consumption pattern. Market models have to change in order to provide incentives for customers to adapt their consumption behavior. Energy policy has to motivate a change towards innovative electricity tariffs comprising dynamic pricing, dependent on the currently available electricity generation [12,13]. Finally, appropriate control algorithms have to be developed to demonstrate the viability of thermal mass activation in the residential building sector. These algorithms have to perform STM activations based on a given economic or ecological control signal, while ensuring constantly the thermal comfort for residents. The focus of this work is developing and evaluating the performance of such a control algorithm for STM activation. To enable adaptability of the algorithm in diverse residential buildings, the control should be functional without sophisticated measurement equipment or detailed knowledge of building specific physical parameters. Despite such simplicity, the control has to beneficially utilize the available STM, while avoiding violations of the thermal comfort boundaries. 1.2 Structure of this work The basic foundations and literature for STM activation and residential load shifting are presented in Section 2. Furthermore, the corresponding state of research is elaborated and the field of required research is presented. The objectives and the approach for the development of the control algorithm are described in Section 3, along with the introduction of utilized tools, methods and boundary conditions employed for the performed simulation, optimization and evaluation in this work. The simulation results of the algorithm\u2019s operation are presented in Section 4, focusing on the resulting thermal comfort, the load shifting efficiency and the sensitivity to different building standards. The computational effort and energy demand of the algorithm\u2019s operation are calculated as well. In Section 5, these results are discussed and evaluated with an additional focus on the limitations of the current work and suggestions for future work. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section 6. 2 Foundations and literature 2.1 Activation of structural thermal mass Generally, the structural thermal mass (STM) of a building is the cumulated heat capacity of the construction materials utilized to build it. Practically, it makes also sense to consider the furnishing in a building as STM, since it contributes significantly to the thermal behavior of the total building, as discussed in [14]. However, the thermal storage capacity of the STM becomes only evident and usable when variations of the temperatures within a building enable the activation, thus the charging and discharging of some fraction of that mass. The acceptability of such required temperature variations by the building\u2019s residents was evaluated in an extensive preceding experimental study [1]. The acceptable temperature range as well as the maximum rate of temperature change derived in that study will be applied as boundary condition for STM activations in this work. In the context of this work, the activation of STM is utilized and evaluated as an alternative thermal energy storage approach and a measure of gaining thermal flexibility in the context of load shifting (LS) and demand side management (DSM). 2.2 Load shifting in residential buildings In the context of power supply, demand side management is the general concept of influencing the consumers\u2019 energy demand with respect to the consumed amount of energy in general and the specific time dependent consumption behavior [15]. The main purpose is to actively change the consumers\u2019 load-shape according to the current availability of electricity in the power supply system [16]. This includes consumption modifications of both, the time pattern and magnitude of the required load. The concept of DSM itself is generally not new, and many applications can be traced back to times when the constant operation of inflexible nuclear or lignite base load power plants was more important than energy efficiency. Today, many viable DSM activities are summarized with the term load shifting, since it combines several typical DSM activities as peak clipping or valley filling. Motivated by the increasingly fluctuating and partially even negative electricity prices on the European electricity markets (e.g. the European Energy Exchange), DSM potentials of large industrial customers have been widely investigated [17,18]. There are only few DSM activities for the residential sector, mostly being based on static, daily repeating time of use (TOU) pricing schemes, motivating the consumers to shift consumption towards the nighttime [19]. Today, the main application in Germany are night storage heaters. [19\u201322]. However, it was shown that with the dissemination of suitable heating systems, thermal demand side management in residential buildings has great potential for stabilizing the future power grid [7,20,23,24]. Exemplary, HPs are operated according to an external signal indicating shut-off periods during peak consumption times, and first solutions for coupling the heat pump operation to the local PV generation are also available [25]. The thermal demand of residential buildings is usually not very flexible itself, since it is strongly correlated with the interior temperatures and thus with the residents\u2019 comfort. Since there are currently only few incentives to invest into technical thermal storage in Germany, the active utilization of the STM in buildings could be a viable alternative enable flexible operation of heating systems. The STM is already available within the buildings and it neither induces acquisition costs nor requires additional floor space for its deployment [26]. Further costs for required control equipment and electronic thermostats are far below the investment into hot water storage tanks or any other thermal storage system [20,26]. 2.3 Current state of research Generally, thermal mass activation in the past was driven by the intermittent operation of heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems or thermally activated building systems (TABS). The focus was on commercial cooling demands, since they required large amounts of electricity during the peak load times of the conventional power generation system [27\u201330]. Seldom, STM activation was also applied to heating in commercial buildings. [31] Residential utilization of STM was rarely investigated since there was no motivation to shift the heating operation of the mostly fossil fueled, thus not time dependent, residential heat generation. Therefore, the only common manifestation of residential STM utilization is the consideration of buildings\u2019 thermal inertia when scheduling room temperature reductions at night or in unoccupied periods [32]. However, recently a transition from fossil fuels towards renewable energy sources and electrified heating systems is observed in the residential sector, resulting in an upcoming interest in residential LS and the identification of the STM as a potential source of flexibility. Mostly, selected archetype buildings or individual thermal zones are simulated using detailed building models, which are parametrized with prescribed set temperature patterns, to evaluate the thermal behavior when STM activations are performed [8,10,33,34]. Usually, idealized simulation boundary conditions (e.g. no internal/external loads) were used in such studies. Observed temperature ranges are either limited by standardized comfort conditions or extended above these limits to evaluate the general thermal behavior of the observed buildings. Findings indicate that poorly insulated buildings can shift a larger amount of energy for a short time, while well insulated buildings can shift a smaller amount of energy over longer periods [8,10,34,35]. Furthermore, it is observed that poorly insulated buildings have significantly higher heat losses induced by STM activation, while very well insulated buildings have a strong risk of violating comfort constraints if STM activations are not well scheduled or internal and solar loads are not predicted precisely enough [8,10,33]. Still, these studies neither suggest viable control strategies for STM activation nor allow to draw conclusions upon a realistic LS potential, since the simulated idealized conditions and the evaluated thermal patterns were usually not representative for regular building operation. Only very few studies [9,36,37] combine residential building simulations with model predictive control (MPC) and optimization approaches controlling STM activations attempting to maximize comfort and LS potential. While the general conclusions regarding the impact of building standard could be confirmed in these studies, the resulting LS potential of STM is found to be lower for model based control when compared to rule based control [36,37]. On one hand, it is driven by the MPC operation, which minimizes comfort violations at the cost of a slightly lower LS potential [37]. On the other hand, the utility functions required to optimize the operation of a given system typically indicate profitability of STM activations only for limited periods, thus also limiting LS activities. 2.4 Field of required research The field of STM activation in the residential sector was just recently identified and only few studies focused on the real applied potential of STM activation for residential LS. For large commercial buildings, the development of tailored control solutions for every large project can be applicable. However, for residential application the cost of designing and parameterizing an individual MPC for any given case would likely exceed potential savings by far. Still, even for the commercial sector it was found that the control concepts should become simpler, reduce the required amount of inputs and self-learning control solutions were recommended [28]. This study contributes to the field of required research by further evaluating STM activation potential in the residential sector, focusing on real life applicability and going beyond the identification of the pure physical potential to store energy in STM. A simple and easily implementable MPC approach is developed and the resulting potential of STM activation for a residential, radiator based application is evaluated. The designed approach is easily adaptable to diverse residential buildings, operational without any prior knowledge of the local building physics and capable of stand alone MPC calculations without extensive computational expenses. For testing purposes, the MPC is embedded into a detailed physical building model representing the \u2018reality\u2019 feedback for the controller and allowing evaluation of the control performance with respect to energy use, storage performance and comfort compliance. The STM activation is controlled by a dynamic primary energy factor (PEF) signal, representing the expected future share of renewable energy in the German power system [38]. The underlying comfort restrictions are based on an extensive preceding experimental study, giving detailed insight into the actual acceptability of the thermal conditions resulting from residential STM activation [1]. In particular comfort criteria are taking into account the current activity of the people and incorporate the temperature change direction as an additional factor to the sole room temperature. The observed comfort restrictions are further specified in Section 3.3.2. 3 Approach 3.1 Concept and objectives To enable the assessment of thermal conditions and energy demands resulting from different control approaches, a detailed physical building model (further explained in Section 3.2.1) is utilized to represent a real building, which would be actually controlled in reality. For a declared \u2018test room\u2019 1 1 As depicted in Fig. 1 in Section 3.2.1. within the modeled building, heating operations are controlled either by the developed MPC algorithm or, for reference purposes, by a rule-based control. The MPC algorithm generates a simple black-box model based on the thermal behavior \u2018measured\u2019 from the physical simulation and uses that model to estimate future thermal conditions, as required for an optimized operation of the heating system. The algorithm constantly aims to find optimal operative temperatures, which ensure thermal comfort for the residents while minimizing the PE demand of heating operations, based on a dynamic PEF [38]. The performance of that control algorithm is evaluated for an observed period of two months in late winter/early spring (February 1st till March 31st). This period is selected, since the yet cold ambient temperatures induce a continuous heating demand, while the PV generation of this period is already prominent enough to ensure regular fluctuations of the PEF. The chosen period is likely to constitute favorable boundary conditions for STM activations and is therefore suitable to assess the general viability of this approach. The control algorithm developed in this work includes a rule-based and a model predictive part. The control is designed to start functioning with no system information and collect required data during its operation. The algorithm requires the current local ambient temperature and global solar irradiation, both available with high granularity from online weather services. Further, the occupancy of the building, the heating system\u2019s set temperature and the current operative temperature is required. Solely the measurement of operative temperature is actually challenging, however, it can be approximated with sufficient precision through the indoor air temperature and inner surface temperatures, which is either measured or estimated from the indoor/ambient temperature difference [39]. Alternatively, operative temperature can be measured with a ordinary temperature sensor placed in a small matte black sphere with the size of an ping pong ball [40]. In this work, a perfect occupancy profile for the observed room is assumed to be known. In reality, such occupancy profiles can be locally generated based on collected statistical occupancy data and modeled with at least reasonable precision, as long as no person specific high level positioning is required [41,42]. For example, the required occupancy signals can be collected from simple motion detectors. At the beginning of the algorithm\u2019s operation, the control system functions rule-based. It controls the set temperature to ensure the comfort operative temperatures while the observed room is occupied. When the room is not occupied, pudoseudo random binary signals (PRBS) [43] are selected as set temperature for the heating system, to gather more diverse measurement data for model fitting. Based on these excitations and all other available measurements, an auto-regressive black-box model with exogenous inputs (ARX) is fitted and the resulting model is updated daily. The model\u2019s accuracy is evaluated via root mean square error (RMSE) calculation, considering the model applicable if an error of less than 1 K is identified between temperature measurements and average predictions for the last three days. This model is then used for the optimization of the heating operation and if an optimal heating schedule is found, the MPC is applied. The optimization uses dynamic constraints for comfortable temperatures and rates of temperature change [1], as well as the objective of minimal PEF. If no optimal solution can be found, the basic rule-based control is applied again. The control algorithm is written in the programming language Python, which executes MATLAB for ARX model fitting, Gurobi for the optimization of heating operations and Dymola/ Modelica for the \u2018reality\u2019 simulation. 3.2 Building simulation 3.2.1 White box model representing the controlled building The physical white box model used in this work to represent the controlled building and generate \u2018measurement\u2019 feedback for the control system was built upon the HouseModels Library, which is part of the AixLib Library made publicly available by the Institute for Energy Efficient Buildings and Indoor Climate at the RWTH Aachen University [44,45]. The thermal building models are developed in the modeling language Modelica and used in the simulation environment Dymola. These dynamic models include detailed representations of all structural components and physical properties of the utilized materials and account for the interaction with the surrounding environment. The HouseModels Library has been previously validated with several test cases, for example with the ASHARE Standard 140 [46]. Simulations in this work utilize a model of a generic residential two-story detached one family house with 150 m2 heated floor area built out of aerated concrete and insulated with mineral wool according to the German energy conservation ordinance EnEV 2009 [47]. This standard is chosen, since it represents an average modern German building constructed or retrofitted ever since 2009 [47,48]. Still, as a measure of sensitivity analysis, the performance of the developed algorithm was also observed when changing the building\u2019s insulation thickness and air-tightness, as indicated by the German thermal insulation ordinance (TIO) 1984 [49] and passive house (PH) standard [50]. The detailed description of all construction materials and their thermal properties is given in Table A.2 through Table A.8 in the appendix, while an overview of the main U-values is given in Table 1 . The layout of the first floor of the modeled building is depicted in Fig. 1 . On this floor, a room with the label \u2018test room\u2019 can be found. This room is considered for further evaluations in this work, while the surrounding rooms are providing the thermal boundary conditions. The room is 2.6\u202fm high and has two windows of 1.8\u202fm2 area each. The room is modeled with one air volume, its space-enclosing structural components and a radiator based heating system based on components of the AixLib [44,45]. The space-enclosing structural components can be distinguished in heat storing components (e.g. walls, ceilings and floor-slabs) and non-storing components such as windows and doors. The heat storing structural components are further composed of multiple material layers like plaster, flooring, aerated concrete or screed. These main materials were further subdivided into very thin layers of maximum 20 kJ/(m2·K) or 2 cm thickness for insulating materials, to ensure a very detailed representation of the thermal building behavior. All structural components and layers were connected to adjoining components, layers, the indoor air or the outer environment by the applicable means of conduction, convection, radiation or mass flows depending on the individual thermal properties of the given component. Infiltration and ventilation air exchange represent the physical interaction of the air volume within any room with the ambient air. The resulting heat flow was calculated from the volumetric flow rate of ambient air into a room and its temperature. The flow rate of infiltration was calculated according to [51], whereas the ventilation air exchange was selected as 0.5 1/h according to the minimal air exchange rate as defined in [51]. Further parameters specifying the applicable air exchange are given in Table A.9 in the appendix. A preceding study indicated that especially under transient conditions, as induced by LS activities, the impact of furniture upon the simulated room temperature is significant [14]. Therefore, another adaption of the AixLib models was the integration of thermal structures representing the furniture within a room. The rooms furnishing was described in a simplified way by thermal capacities with properties of wood and metal, accounting for the assumed thermal mass and surface area of these materials in a given room [14]. Accordingly a correction was introduced, to account for the wall surface area covered by furnishing and therefore not included in the convective and radiative heat exchange within the room. The properties of the modeled materials, which represent the furnishing for each room of the simulated building, are given in Table A.1 in the Appendix. For the purpose of this analysis, it is not substantial to model the heat generation system in detail. Heat is generated by an ideal heat source, which is connected to the hydraulic, radiator based heating system in the observed \u2018test room\u2019. A nominal heating load of 829 W was calculated for the observed \u2018test room\u2019 according to [51], including a heat-up factor of 16 W/m2, as suggested for buildings with a moderate nighttime temperature reduction. Therefore, the modeled \u2018test room\u2019 is equipped with a type 22 steel panel radiator 2 2 adapted from: Kermi therm-x2 Profil-V, [52]. with a nominal power of 854 W. In the sensitivity analysis, the observed room\u2019s radiator is adapted to a 1065 W model for the TIO 1984 case, and a 411 W radiator for the PH according to [51] and [52]. Heat emission of the radiators is controlled by a conventional proportional integral (PI) controller, thus assuming a high quality level of thermostatic control. The flow and return temperatures for the heating system are 55 and 45 ∘C respectively, as designed for a low temperature heating system according to [53]. A share of 70% convective and 30% radiative heat flow was assumed [52,54]. All other rooms in the simulated building are not equipped with radiators, but controlled by ideal heat flows to maintain constantly a temperature of 22 ∘C. This is crucial to enable ideally constant boundary conditions for the observed room, despite the dynamically changing weather conditions impacting also the other rooms of the building. This allows at least partially to decouple the performance of the algorithm from impacts of the chosen building geometry. 3.2.2 Black-box model for predictive control The MPC relies on a simple ARX 3 3 auto-regressive model with exogenous inputs. black-box model to forecast the operative temperature within a controlled thermal zone. ARX models have been widely integrated in MPC and were successfully used to optimize energy consumption in the commercial building context [31]. However, non-linear models with higher complexity have been found to perform better [55]. Several methodologies for appropriate model choice exist [56,57], and have been consulted during the selection and development of a suitable model for the given control challenge. As a trade of between precision and simplicity an ARX model was selected in this work. The finally selected modeling approach and the structure of the ARX model are presented in the following section. The model is designed to predict the operative temperature, as it better characterizes the comfort of the occupants. The prediction of the operative temperature required for MPC algorithm consists of two parts. First, the auto-regression calculation, which is a weighted sum of the variable\u2019s own previous values. Second, the exogenous variables, which include the impacts of other factors influencing the operative temperature, adding their weighted values from the previous and current time step. Underlying exogenous variables are the solar irradiation (Ishortwave ), the set temperature (Tset ), the ambient temperature (Tout ), and the thermal zone\u2019s occupancy (occ). Thus, in this model, the uncontrolled heat gains within the heat balance are represented by solar irradiation and occupancy, the controlled heating power is represented by the operative temperature and the set temperature, whereas the heat losses are represented by the ambient temperature and the operative temperature. Such simple model structure was purposely chosen, to prove the model\u2019s applicability in real-life implementations with poor availability of measurements and very limited computational capacities. The choice of input variables is further supported by common gray-box and state space models, which typically utilize similar inputs for the temperature prediction in buildings [58]. The presented input variables were chosen based on the following considerations: \u2022 Required variables are available from online sources (e.g. weather data from online services) or can be measured/estimated without complex and expensive equipment. \u2022 Selected variables contain the minimal, though sufficient, information to formulate the total heat balance of a given thermal zone. \u2022 The model is simple enough to be computed and optimized without the requirement of high performance computing. A third order ARX model with 15-minute time steps is used. This means that three previous values of the operative temperature are used as the auto-regressive input for the prediction of the upcoming value. The respective time steps are referenced in square brackets in the following, where [t] is the current time step, [t+1] the predicted time step (t+15 min), [t-1] the previous time step (t-15 min), etc. Similarly, three time steps of the exogenous variables are taken as inputs, however, here the parameters of the actual predicted time step [t+1] are assumed to be available. The model order was selected based on a literature review by [43], which indicates good performance for third order model structures. The resulting structure of the ARX model is presented in Eqs. (1) and (2). In Eq. (1), To is the operative temperature, c i,y are the ARX fitting parameters, and X → is the vector of exogenous variables (specified in Eq. (2)). The parameters are computed using the ARX model identification function \u2018arx\u2019 in MATLAB [59]. (1) T o [ t + 1 ] = c → 0 , X → · X → [ t + 1 ] + c → 1 , X → · X → [ t ] + c → 2 , X → · X → [ t − 1 ] + c 1 , T o · T o [ t ] + c 2 , T o · T o [ t − 1 ] + c 3 , T o · T o [ t − 2 ] (2) X → = ( T s e t I s h o r t w a v e T o u t o c c ) 3.3 Boundary conditions and parametrization 3.3.1 Weather data To ensure that simulations are performed based on representative environmental boundary conditions, weather data from the test reference year (TRY) [60] for the German Lower Rhine region (western Germany - TRY region number five) was applied. This data was used for both simulations, the white box \u2018reality\u2019 representation and the ARX model utilized in the optimization process of the MPC. Thus, a perfect weather prediction was assumed to be available for the MPC. Taking into account that the optimization is performed for a horizon of 24 h and repeated hourly, it is likely that weather predictions with high quality would be actually available for the observed period. 3.3.2 Comfort boundaries Comfort boundaries for the MPC were taken from a preceding experimental study focused on the perception of transient thermal conditions induced by residential load shifting activities [1]. The major findings of the named study are the impact of the peoples activity level and the relevance of the temperature change direction. Thus, whether there is a change towards a more or a less preferred temperature, has a crucial impact upon the acceptable extent and change rate of temperature deviations. This stands in great contrast to conventional comfort criteria focusing solely on the absolute temperature and treating all types of temperature changes equally. The dynamic comfort constraints adapted from [1] and used in this analysis are presented in Table 2 , whereas the actual dynamic temperature profiles resulting from assumed activity patterns are visualized in Fig. 2 . Exemplary activity patterns are used to implement different comfort constraints for active, inactive and sleeping occupants. It is assumed that occupants present throughout daytime are rather active (cooking, cleaning, etc.), whereas they will have a lower activity level in the evening (watching television, reading a book, etc.). Further, it is assumed that activity increases again in the last hour before nighttime. Since the impact of LSiTD upon the thermal perception of sleeping occupant was not evaluated in the underlying study, nighttime comfort temperatures were selected according to the PMV/PPD 4 4 PMV: predicted mean vote, PPD: predicted percentage dissatisfied. approach [61]. Conventional comfort boundaries derived from current international standards [61\u201363] were used for comparison in two reference and one of the observed optimization scenarios. Based on these standards, an operative temperature of 22 ∘C is assumed to be the optimal comfort temperature for the observed residential conditions, when generalizing across all activity conditions. Furthermore, temperature fluctuations of up to\u202f±\u202f2 K with rates of temperature change below 2 K/h are expected to be widely acceptable, with on average less than 10% of the people being dissatisfied with the resulting thermal environment. 3.3.3 Occupancy and internal loads Internal loads representing the heat emission of occupants, appliances and lights were determined according to [64] for the white-box \u2018reality\u2019 model. In this simulation, it is defined that the \u2018test room\u2019 is occupied by one person performing sedentary activities. All internal heat gains are described in Table 3 . The occupancy of the observed room was predefined by a generic occupancy profile, generated based on the approach of Richardson [65]. This method generates statistically based occupancy time-series with daily changing profiles and general differentiation between weekdays and weekends. Therein, occupancy is defined as the actual presence of an active person within a given zone at a given time, thus resulting profiles are suitable for most residential zones except for the bedroom. Therefore, in this work, for the case of room occupancy, all internal loads are assumed to be active, whereas no internal loads are considered when the room is unoccupied. Thus, as a simplification, potentially existing minor heat gains from the standby of appliances are neglected, whereas moderate lighting is assumed to be always used in the occupied room. The estimated total thermal load from appliances and lighting of 165 W is assumed to be a good approximation of average heat emissions in an occupied residential room based on [64]. Fig. 3 exemplary presents the occupancy profile for two weeks in the middle of the observed two month period. It can be seen that the profile is irregular, comprising both long periods of presence and absence as well as quick changes between these two conditions. Based on this profile, the \u2018test room\u2019 is on average occupied for 34.5% of the observed period, therein 21.5% in phases when occupants are considered active, 11.8% in inactive phases and since the defined zone is not a bedroom, it is only occupied 1.2% of the nighttime. 3.3.4 Dynamic primary energy factor The utility function for the MPC algorithm is based upon a dynamic primary energy factor, enabling the minimization of the PE demand for heating purposes. This factor is adapted from the work of [38], where a fluctuating PEF is calculated based on actual time series of the German electricity demand and renewable generation from wind power and PV in 2015. The underlying time series are taken from publicly available measurement data of the four German transmission system operators [66\u201369], whereas the general PEF values are based on the definitions in German legislation and standardization [70]. The resulting profiles can be additionally scaled to represent any given share of renewable electricity generation in the power system. In this work the PEF is scaled for a renewable generation share of 80% as targeted by the German government for the year 2050 [11]. In this way, the utilized profile ensures enough fluctuation to actually enable a dynamic operation of the heating system, as required for LS and STM activation. The resulting dynamic PEF signal for the two-month period observed in this analysis is presented in Fig. 4 , whereas average PEF values for different phases of the observed period are given in Table 4 . 3.4 Model predictive control 3.4.1 Self-learning model predictive algorithm An overview of the designed control algorithm is given as a flow chart in Fig. 5 and its functionality is described in the following. The control algorithm is executed once per hour. For every iteration, it is first evaluated whether an adequately accurate ARX model is available. If this is the case, the dynamic heating mode is activated and the MPC attempts to optimize the heating operations for a time horizon of 24 h. If an optimal heating operation is found, the first hour of the optimized set temperature schedule is used as actual set temperature profile for the heating system. It is also possible that the optimization fails, meaning that there is no solution found for the observed optimization problem. This can occur, for example, when the violation of comfort constraints within the optimization horizon cannot be successfully prevented by any possible heating control measures. One reason for that could be high uncontrollable internal or solar heat gains, making it impossible to stay within comfort constraints. When no adequate ARX model is available or the optimization fails, one of the alternative rule-based control modes is selected. While the building is occupied, the comfort mode is activated, thus setting optimal comfort temperatures according to the current activity level of the residents. However, if the building is not occupied, the algorithm checks whether system identifications can be performed. If ambient temperature is lower than the minimal acceptable building temperature (19 ∘C) and the current PEF is not higher than its yearly average value of 1, the identification mode is activated. The heating system then receives pseudo random signals [43] as set temperature. Thus, the diversity of heating operations and measured temperature patterns increases, allowing generation of better fitted ARX models. When the building is unoccupied but the requirements for system identification are violated, the energy saving mode is selected and the minimal temperature for unoccupied conditions (19 ∘C) is defined as set temperature. The set temperature profile for the upcoming hour is then compiled from the operation modes individually selected for any 15 min time step. Finally, the complied set temperature profile for one hour is simulated within the physical model and resulting operative temperatures are returned to the control algorithm as measurement values for its next iteration. Furthermore, once a day all gathered measurements are used for fitting of new ARX models. The ARX model is fitted for the first time when measurement data of at least one week is available, utilizing the arx function [59] in MATLAB. The first four days of that week are used for fitting and subsequent three days to asses the model\u2019s accuracy. If more data is available, fitting horizons of 1 to 12 weeks are used to fit several models and the most accurate model of these is selected for the MPC operation. The maximum fitting horizon of 12 weeks is selected since the thermal behavior of a building is distinctly varying from season to season, thus the quality of a data-driven model fitted across many seasons is likely to decrease. Since the evaluated period in this analysis comprises only 59 days, the algorithm is provided additionally with simulated measurement data for one month before the observed period, to allow better observation of utilized fitting horizons. New model parameters are fitted every 24 h. After every fit, the model\u2019s accuracy is assessed through the calculation of the RMSE between operative temperature \u2018measurements\u2019 from the \u2018reality\u2019 simulations and estimations calculated based on the fitted model. Independently of the actually utilized fitting horizon, the data of the last three days is excluded from fitting and used for the accuracy assessment, calculating an average RMSE value for these days according to Eq. (3). If the found average RMSE is below 1 K, the model\u2019s accuracy is assumed adequate and the model will be used for MPC. This threshold is selected, since it represents already a decent estimation for such a simplified model, and since temperature deviations of\u202f±\u202f1 K from optimal comfort temperatures are still in the comfort range according to both the conventional and the dynamic comfort constraints. When the calculated RMSE is larger, the control will use the last model that was found accurate enough. If the currently fitted model is found inadequate and the last model fulfilling quality criteria is older than 3 days, the ARX model is not used for MPC until the next successful model fit. (3) R M S E = 1 3 ∑ d = 1 3 1 24 · 4 ∑ t = ( d − 1 ) · 24 + 1 24 · 4 · d ( T p r e d i c t e d ( t ) − T a c t u a l ( t ) ) 2 3.4.2 Optimization When an applicable ARX model is available, the dynamic heating mode is activated, thus the control algorithm attempts to perform heating operations based on the MPC, minimizing the PE demand for heating. An overview of the optimization procedure is given as a flow chart in Fig. 6 , while the individual steps of the approach are explained in the following. Generally, the optimization minimizes the PE required for the heating operation by minimizing the PEF weighted difference between the set temperature and the actually minimal acceptable operative temperature at all times. The utilized hourly changing PEF based on the findings of [38] allows correlating the chosen set temperature and the actual PE demand in the cost function given in Eq. (4). The dynamic PEF for the upcoming 24 h is expected to be known and available for the optimization. The cost function is minimized over a horizon of 24 h with a time step of 15 min. However, only the outcomes of the first optimized hour are returned as set temperatures for the MPC, while the optimization is repeated once every hour. (4) min T set ( ∑ t = 1 24 · 4 P E F ( t ) · ( T set ( t ) − T min ( t ) ) ) Four different optimization scenarios are implemented to test the potential of the developed algorithm, each with different static or flexible thermal comfort constraints. In scenario O1, fixed conventional comfort constraints are applied at all times, being 22\u202f±\u202f2 ∘C, with maximal temperature changes of 2 K/h. The dynamic comfort constraints (as presented in Fig. 2), which change according to occupancy and occupant activity, are utilized in scenario O2a together with the conventional temperature change restriction of 2 K/h and in scenario O2b with the dynamic rates of temperature change. Finally, in scenario O2c, the calculated RMSE is utilized to improve the model\u2019s compliance with the comfort limits. Thus, the applicable dynamic constraints are narrowed by subtracting half of the currently calculated RMSE from the higher and adding RMSE/2 to the lower limit. Since the maximal allowed RMSE is 1 K and the range of acceptable temperatures in occupied times is 3 K, a reduction of this range by more than 2·RMSE/2 would strongly reduce the potential for STM activation. Thus, half of the currently calculated RMSE is chosen as a trade-off between comfort improvement and optimization potential. The specific comfort constraints for all optimization scenarios are given in Table 5 . For all scenarios, a linear optimization is performed in Gurobi (version 6.5.0) utilizing the Python gurobipy package, both developed by Gurobi Optimization Incorporation. Thereby, a deterministic concurrent method [71] is employed for this optimization. This approach starts different solvers on different threads simultaneously and chooses the results of the method that finishes first. The deterministic version of the optimization method is utilized, thus under equal boundary conditions always the same optimal solution is found. If the optimization should fail, the algorithm reduces the optimization horizon in 2 h steps down to a minimal scope of 12 h. Only if these scope reductions still do not render the problem solvable, the total optimization actually fails. It was also evaluated, whether the introduction of a slack variable making the comfort constraints slightly flexible would increase the chance of finding optimal solutions. In case that no solution for the optimization was found, the slack variable increased the comfort constraints by as much as the current RMSE, thus up to 1 K. However, this relaxation of the permissible temperature range did not noticeably increase the chance of finding an optimal solution and was therefore rejected. 3.4.3 Evaluation concept To enable a precise evaluation of the control algorithm\u2019s performance, three reference scenarios were defined and simulated. For all reference scenarios, a rule-based control is used to implement time-dependent temperature profiles. References 1 and 2 allow the comparison of the developed algorithm with conventional building operations, keeping temperatures either constant at 22 ∘C (scenario R1) or reducing them in phases without occupancy and at night to 20 ∘C (scenario R2). In turn, reference scenario R3 is constantly following the optimal temperatures of the dynamic comfort profile and serves therefore as the main benchmark for the MPC algorithm. Table 5 presents all thermal constraints for these reference cases as well as for the optimization scenarios described in the optimization Section 3.4.2. The compliance with the defined dynamic comfort constraints was evaluated by quantifying the violations of these constraints for each scenario and comparing them against the optimal temperature oriented reference scenario R3. For each time step (t) when the operative temperature was outside of the comfort range, this violation time (tout in 0.25 h) was multiplied with the extent of the violation (ΔTout in K), thus resulting in the temperature violation index (TVI), giving the total constraint transgression in Kh. Similarly, the violations of the dynamic rate of temperature change are observed, however now on a hourly base. Thus, for all full hours (h) when the rate of temperature change is exceeded (hexceed in h), the extent of the violation (ΔTCexceed in K) was cumulated, resulting in the temperature change violation index (TCVI) likewise in Kh. (5) T V I = ∑ t Δ T out · t out (6) T C V I = ∑ h Δ T C exceed · h exceed To quantify the load shifting potential resulting from STM activations in an observed thermal zone, absolute amounts of stored or shifted energy are frequently stated [10]. However, such a measure is sensitive to the actually prevailing ambient conditions and the extent of the STM activation achievable for any individual occasion. In particular, the storage potential is impacted by the activation times and the temperature profiles throughout the activation phases, which are different on any single occasion when operated by an optimized MPC. Finally, with such control it is seldom possible to identify individual STM activation phases, which could be considered independent from the preceding utilization of the STM. It is therefore not viable to define an actual LS potential for individual activation phases. Thus, the potential of MPC operated LS should be quantified for a representative longer period of time, comprising a wide range of diverse STM activation, as applied by [8,9]. Also, it can be questioned if the frequently used normalization of the LS potential per m2 of considered floor space is meaningful. Especially, when dynamic occupancy and activity oriented temperature profiles are utilized for MPC of STM activation, it is likely that different utilization patterns of a thermal zone will have different resulting LS potentials per m2. As a result, relative measures describing the overall performance of the observed thermal zone throughout the whole observation period are chosen to quantify the LS potential in this work. Nevertheless, some absolute and m2 normalized values of the LS extent will also be presented to enable comparability with existing studies. It depends on the motivation of LS activities, whether the impact upon final energy or primary energy 5 5 FE: final energy, PE: primary energy. is of larger interest. Grid-services, for example, require large FE shifting potentials, while the focus of environmentally motivated LS is on PE. Therefore, the LS performance of the MPC is evaluated based on three efficiency measures, which observe separately the absolute LS efficiency as well as the LS performance with respect to FE and PE. The absolute load shifting efficiency is defined according to Eqs. (7)\u2013(9). This value (ηLS ) indicates which share of additional heating energy utilized for STM activation in the MPC scenarios is actually utilized to reduce the heating demand of the room at later times, taking the heating operations in scenario R3 as a reference. Thereby, all time steps (t) when scenario R3 requires less FE than an MPC case are defined as charging phases, whereas when R3 requires more FE than the MPC case, this is observed as a discharging phase. (7) η L S = F E MPC discharged F E MPC charged (8) F E MPC discharged = { ∑ t ( F E R3 ( t ) − F E MPC ( t ) ) ∀ t ∈ F E R3 ( t ) > F E MPC ( t ) 0 ∀ t ∈ F E R3 ( t ) ≤ F E MPC ( t ) (9) F E MPC charged = { ∑ t ( F E MPC ( t ) − F E R3 ( t ) ) ∀ t ∈ F E MPC ( t ) > F E R3 ( t ) 0 ∀ t ∈ F E MPC ( t ) ≤ F E R3 ( t ) Further, the final energy demand change, which compares the total FE demands in the MPC scenarios against the FE demand in scenario R3 is defined according to Eq. (10). And finally, the primary energy demand change, a similar comparison of the PE demands of the MPC scenarios against R3, is presented in Eq. (11). (10) F E demand change = ∑ t ( F E MPC ( t ) − F E R3 ( t ) ) ∑ t F E R3 ( t ) (11) P E demand change = ∑ t ( P E MPC ( t ) − P E R3 ( t ) ) ∑ t P E R3 ( t ) 3.5 Computational performance evaluation One of the main objectives for the development of the MPC algorithm is such simplicity that would allow implementing the suggested concept of MPC for STM activation in regular residential buildings without complex measurements, expert knowledge and expensive computations. Therefore, the actual computational effort of the performed model fittings and optimizations is estimated, being related to the expected calculation effort of a simple residential energy management system. The developed algorithm was operated on a workstation (WS) with a 64-bit Intel Xeon E5-2667 6-core CPU clocked at 2.9 Ghz, 32 GB RAM running a 64 bit version of Windows 7 Enterprise. The processor utilized in the WS has a computational capacity of 139 GFLOP 6 6 109 floating point operations per second. [72] per core. It was estimated which calculation effort would result if the developed algorithm would be operated on a Raspberry Pi 3 B (RP3) single-board computer. The system is chosen for comparison, since it is widely available at a low price, 7 7 Currently a Raspberry Pi 3 can be purchased for less than 35 Euro. has high connectivity 8 8 USB 2.0, 100 Mbit/s Ethernet, 802.11n wireless, Bluetooth 4.1, GPIO and HDMI. [73] and its Linux based operation system allows the usage of diverse programming and optimization codes [74]. The system selected for comparison is equipped with a 64-bit ARM Cortex-A53 4-core CPU clocked at 1.2\u202fGHz, 1 GB RAM, running a 64-bit version of Raspbian and requiring 1.8 W in idle and 4.4 W at full load [74]. The processor of the RP3 has a computational capacity of 6.4 GFLOP, when equipped with an additional passive heat sink [74]. For this evaluation, the WS computation times for the Matlab based model fitting and the optimizations performed with Gurobi were calculated using a single core and assuming the worst case computation effort feasible in the developed algorithm. Thus, for the fitting problem, a maximal availability of fitting data was assumed, resulting in 12 ARX models that need to be calculated. For the optimization, the worst case was defined by an optimization failure, since the 7 possible optimization horizons between 12 and 24 h are calculated in this case. The actually measured computation times of the WS were converted to estimated computation times of the RP3 according to three factors, one for the utilized processor and two for the utilized software. The actually observed additional RAM requirement of approx. 400 MB when running fitting or optimization routines was not expected to be a limiting factor. The processor oriented factor fp is calculated based on the computational capacity of the observed platforms as a ratio of their GFLOP scores. The software oriented factors are necessary, since the utilized software Matlab and Gurobi require expensive licenses and are not operational on a RP3. Therefore, alternative software which is freely available and functioning on the Linux based RP3 is selected for this computation time estimation. Is is assumed that model fitting would be performed on the RP3 with GNUOctave [75], a free scientific programming language, which is widely compatible with Matlab syntax and scripts. According to a comparison based on 50 benchmarks [76] Matlab is 2.5 times faster than the GNUOctave software, resulting in a ffit factor of 2.5. Similarly, it is assumed that the linear optimization would be performed with Cbc [77], which is an open-source linear programming solver. According to a comparison based on 87 optimization problems [78], Gurobi is up to 32 times faster than Cbc, resulting in a fopt factor of 32. Calculation times for RP3 were estimated by multiplying the calculation times measured on WS by the presented factors. The required FE and PE demand for the operation of the RP3 were estimated as well to compare these to the energy savings. It was assumed that the RP3 is operating in full load throughout the optimization and fitting routines and stays idle all the remaining time. Finally, it is stressed that the described performance estimation is expected to be suitable as a rough estimation for the calculation effort the developed algorithm would require, when recoded to be operated with freely available software on a distinctly simpler hardware. The actually implemented code is not operational on the soft- and hardware described in this evaluation. 4 Results 4.1 General performance of the ARX model and MPC algorithm All implemented scenarios are viable and the underlying control mechanisms are able to control the operative temperature within the \u2018test room\u2019 in a meaningful way over the total observed period. For the MPC algorithm controlled scenarios, an adequately precise ARX model was available at all times. The worst observed RMSE in accuracy estimation is 0.56 K and still well below the threshold of 1 K. A total of 1680 individual ARX models were fitted by the algorithm across all MPC based scenarios, whereof 236 were actually selected for MPC operation. Fig. 7 presents a histogram of the RMSE values achieved by all actually selected models in the accuracy estimation process. Most models selected for MPC had a RMSE in the range of 0.2-0.3 K, and 90% of the chosen models had a RMSE below 0.35 K. The average fitting data horizon utilized for the ARX models is 2.3 weeks, with a slight tendency towards longer horizons as more fitting data is available. Fig. 8 depicts the average fitting horizon of the selected ARX models in dependence of the actually available fitting data. It can be seen that even in the last weeks of the observed period, when more than 10 weeks of fitting data are available, the average selected fitting horizon is 2.8 weeks. A histogram of the fitting horizons of selected ARX models is given in Fig. 9 , depicting that 57% of the utilized models are fitted only with the data of the past week and 74% with two previous weeks, even though data of at least 4 weeks is available for all fitting iterations. Probably, the temperature fluctuations resulting from both STM activations and building identification yield well excited measurement data for model fitting, being the reason for the observed short fitting horizons [79]. Nevertheless, 7% of selected models have fitting horizons of even more than 6 weeks. In total, 43% of the selected models were based on fitting horizons longer than one week. Thus, the approach of creating models with different fitting horizons and selecting individually the best performing model proves to be viable and superior to a fixed definition of the fitting horizon. The dynamic heating mode is active for more than 40% of the evaluation period in all optimized scenarios, reaching a share of 64% for the O1 scenario. System identification is performed for approx. 6% of the time across all scenarios. When neither MPC operation nor identification were possible, heating is operated in comfort or energy saving mode according to the occupancy status. A full overview of the employed individual control modes is given in Fig. 10 for all optimized scenarios. When further specifying the operation times of different control modes, it can be calculated that scenario O1 operated 69% of the occupied times in MPC mode, whereas O2 scenarios were just able to find optimal control paths for 27\u201338% of occupied phases. Thus it can be derived that the optimization problem is distinctly easier to solve for static comfort constraints. An exemplary sequence of the algorithm\u2019s control behavior is presented in Fig. 11 for the O2b scenario. The \u2018measured\u2019 and predicted temperatures are well aligned in unoccupied phases (when Tmax is set to 24 ∘C) and at nighttime, with increasing deviations in phases with uncontrollable internal or solar heat gains. Still it can be recognized that the \u2018measured\u2019 temperature is close to the lower boundary in phases with high PEF and increases clearly when PEF is low. Periods when the set temperature is above the optimal comfort temperature are marked as STM activation phases in the lower part of the graph. These STM activations are frequently interrupted or limited, even when the \u2018measured\u2019 temperature is still well in the comfort range and the PEF is low. This happens either when the predicted temperature reaches the upper boundary, or when strong fluctuations of the predicted temperature prevent successful optimization and MPC is deactivated. However, due to such conservative operation, only few minor comfort violations are visible despite the distinct STM activation activities. On few occasions, the identification mode is activated, inducing significant temperature fluctuations at unoccupied phases with a PEF below average. 4.2 Resulting thermal comfort The thermal comfort is a crucial focus point in the evaluation of dynamic STM activation, since the compliance with comfort constraints is a vital condition for the general acceptance of such LS operations. Therefore, the simulated thermal conditions of all observed scenarios are presented and evaluated in the following, with a major focus on the impact of the suggested dynamic comfort constraints upon thermal comfort. Fig. 12 depicts the resulting average operative temperatures for the individual occupancy phases over the total observed period for all evaluated scenarios. The average values for the reference scenarios are well aligned with their defined temperature profiles, not diverging more than 0.5 K from set temperatures of the active, inactive and unoccupied phases. Solely throughout the seldom and short periods of occupancy during the nighttime, scenario R2 does not reach the targeted temperature reduction. It can be concluded that the rule-based control utilized for the reference scenarios is working properly. As expected, thermal conditions in scenario R3 are well aligned with the optimal temperatures throughout all occupancy phases. Therefore, scenario R3 is meaningful as the main benchmark for the further evaluation of the observed MPC scenarios. To improve clarity, the results of reference scenarios R1 and R2 will not be further presented in the following, however they can be found in [1]. All optimized cases keep the average temperatures above the optimal temperature for active, sleeping and unoccupied phases, indicating that STM activations are actually performed. Only throughout the inactive phase, the optimized temperatures are close to the lower comfort boundary. Scenario O1, which is actually not limited by the dynamic comfort constraints, violates on average the minimal temperature for inactive occupants. All other MPC scenarios are on average not more than 0.7 K away from optimal temperatures for the occupied phases. Fig. 13 depicts the TVI and the TCVI scores for all scenarios. As a benchmark, a daily temperature or temperature change violation of 1 K for 1 h would result in a TVI/TCVI score of 59 Kh for the evaluated 59-day period. Scenario R3 follows optimal temperatures at all times, thus violating given temperature limits only in the transition phases between different dynamic constraints. Thus, the TVI and TCVI values of scenario R3 can be seen as a benchmark for the lowest values, which can be reached when a rule-based control follows the dynamic temperature constraints. MPC scenario O1, which is controlled according to conventional comfort constraints, has the highest TVI score of all scenarios and the highest TCVI rating among the MPC scenarios. It is actually not unexpected that scenario O1 performs poorly on criteria not implemented into its control. Still, the results are emphasized to indicate that a conventional STM activation approach would result in far-reaching comfort violations according to the dynamic comfort constraints applied in this work. Scenario O2a exceeds the comfort violations of scenario R3 by approx. 25% for both TVI and TCVI, whereas scenario O2b has very similar scores than R3. Finally, in scenario O2c, the adaptive limitation of the comfort range by the value of the current RMSE reduces TVI by 7% and TCVI even by 42%. TVI improvement is limited probably because model predictions were either good enough to ensure the adherence of temperature constraints anyway, or the predictions were not suitable for MPC at all. However, the adaption of comfort constraints resulted in an overall reduction of the applicable temperature range, thus limiting temperature fluctuations and clearly improving the TCVI. 4.3 Energy consumption and load shifting efficiency Having shown that the MPC algorithm is generally capable of ensuring required comfort conditions, now the energy consumption of the individual scenarios is compared and impacts upon the final energy consumption, the average PEF and the resulting primary energy consumption are observed. Fig. 14 depicts these values for all scenarios. The MPC with conventional comfort constraints (scenario O1) has final and primary energy consumption well above these of scenarios with dynamic comfort constraints. However, the exemplary defined occupancy and activity periods in this analysis have a strong impact upon the resulting heating requirements and the choice of different periods could potentially change the results. Therefore, no general conclusion upon the energy consumption impact of conventional or dynamic temperature constraints can be made. Nevertheless, the assumption of higher occupancy and lower occupant activity in the evenings seems generally reasonable. This indicates the general challenge of increased heating demand in the evening, thus at times with hardly any PV generation and therefore higher average PEF values in the utilized profile, as presented in Table 4. Due to the increased temperatures required for STM activation, the FE consumption of all MPC scenarios are clearly higher than in the reference scenario R3. In turn, they have significantly reduced average PEF factors, being even 6\u201310% below the average value of the total observed period. As a result, all O2 scenarios are able to compensate the higher FE consumption induced by the STM activation and reach PE consumption below the level of scenario R3. Solely, potentially limited through the overall smaller range of temperature fluctuations, scenario O1 can not compensate the high FE consumption with its reduced PEF. Scenarios with a PE consumption reduction (O2a-c) reached absolute FE LS volumes of 137\u2013156 kWh for the observed 59-day period. When normalized to the size of the modeled \u2018test room\u2019 of 16 m2, the LS potential is 8.6\u20139.8 kWh/m2 or on average daily 146\u2013166 Wh/m2. Fig. 15 presents the associated LS performance of STM activation for all scenarios controlled by the MPC algorithm, always in relation to the optimal temperature scenario R3 (as defined in Section 3.4.3). The actual absolute LS efficiency is below 50% for all MPC scenarios, thus more than half of the additional FE consumption for STM activation is lost. Most of the energy is spent for maintaining temperatures above the optimal level, as indicated by the average temperatures presented in Fig. 12. Consequently, also the FE consumption increases with FE consumption changes in the range of 30\u201358%. However, driven by the reduced average PEF values, the PE consumption is reduced for all MPC scenarios controlled according to dynamic comfort constraints, reaching up to 7% lower PE consumption than scenario R3. Fig. 16 exemplifies one of the most prominent STM activation phases within the evaluated period. The operative temperatures of scenarios O2b and R3 are compared in the upper part of the diagram, whereas the respective heating power and the current PEF are depicted in the lower part, being normalized between 0 and 1. The MPC increases the temperature substantially for a period of 12 h while the PEF is 0. As a result, the heating consumption is significantly reduced throughout the subsequent occupancy phases, which occur at times with an increased PEF. The FE consumption for the 31 h period presented in Fig. 16 is 21.7 kWh in the R3 scenario and 42.5 kWh for the O2b case. The PE consumption is 15.0 kWh for R3 and 12.1 kWh for O2b. This results in an FE consumption increase of 96% and an PE consumption reduction of 19% for the observed period. Due to the STM activation in the first 12 h of the depicted period, the FE consumption of the subsequent 19 h is reduced by 4.3 kWh, yielding an η LS of 21%. If the resulting storage capacity is reported in Wh/m2 as suggested by [8], the resulting capacity would be 269 Wh/m2 of the final energy and 176 Wh/m2 of the primary energy. 4.4 Sensitivity to building standard The sensitivity of the MPC algorithm\u2019s performance with respect to the building standard is evaluated based on a comparison of EnEV 2009, TIO 1984 and the Passive House standard 9 9 \u2018EnEV 2009\u2019 or \u201809\u2019 refers to the energy conservation ordinance 2009, \u2018TIO 1984\u2019 or \u201884\u2019 refers to the thermal insulation ordinance 1984, \u2018PH\u2019 refers to the Passive House standard. for the reference scenario R3 and the MPC case O2b. Generally, average temperatures for the different occupancy phases are lower as in EnEV 2009 for the case of TIO 1984 and higher for PH as depicted in Fig. 17 . The high heat losses in TIO 1984 enable stronger temperature fluctuations and thus better adherence to the dynamic set temperatures. However, for the reference case R3 (84), these fluctuations also induce more temperature and temperature change violations, as depicted in Fig. 18 . These violations can be well mitigated in the MPC controlled O2b (84) scenario, reaching even distinctly lower temperature change violations than in the EnEV case, mainly because the MPC induced STM activations reduce the frequency of maximal permissible temperature reductions. The higher insulation level of the building envelope and the lower solar energy transmittance of the windows in the PH reduce the extent of temperature fluctuations. This also reduces temperature and temperature change violations in the reference case R3 (PH) (Fig. 18). The low temperature violation level can be even further reduced by the MPC, while temperature change violations are low in any PH scenario due to the moderate slopes of temperature fluctuations. For the TIO 1984 standard, the heating demand is generally larger and rather continuous, resulting in a lower PEF for the reference case, since the heat up phase in the evening is not that predominant anymore. In turn, the high heat losses are minimizing the potential for STM activation and therefore also the average PEF decreases just slightly. Due to the high heat losses, the MPC has generally difficulties to predict and control the rapid temperature fluctuations, as indicated by an MPC share of just 40%, as compared to 48% in the EnEV 2009 case. Additionally, the energy charged into the STM can be just stored for short periods due to the high heat losses. Therefore, STM activations are seldom performed and FE consumption just increases by 16%, as depicted in Fig. 19 . As a result, the reduced average PEF just compensates the increased energy consumption for STM activation. The actual PE consumption is solely 2% lower than the reference scenario (Fig. 19). In the case of the PH, the reduced temperature fluctuations enable MPC operation at 61% of the observed time, however only a limited part of the available temperature range can be actually used. Since the building cools down very slowly, even the moderate STM activation can shift heating demand across substantial periods, thus being able to concentrate most of the required heating activities in phases with lower PEF. The resulting average PEF is 47% lower than in the PH reference and even 33% lower than the average of the observed period. Still, due to the low general heating demand, the performed STM activations increase the FE demand by 58%. However, that increase is overcompensated by the very low average PEF, resulting in a 15% lower PE consumption for the PH with MPC (Fig. 19). Despite of these differences, the absolute LS efficiency (ηLS ) calculated from Eq. (7) is constantly in the range of 41\u201346% for all MPC scenarios, indicating that not the building standard dependent heat losses to the ambient, but the increase of operative temperatures above the optimal level are the main driver for the poor absolute LS efficiency. 4.5 Computational effort required for the MPC based STM activation The ratio between the GFLOP scores of the WS and RP3 is calculated as shown in Eq. (12). Thus, it is estimated that the RP3 is 22 times slower than the actually utilized hardware. (12) f p = 139 G F L O P 6.4 G F L O P ≈ 22 Table 6 presents the actually measured calculation times of the WS and the estimated calculation times for the RP3, based on the software factors presented in Section 3.5. It can be seen that even for the worst case of the hourly optimization a calculation time of approx. 0.3 h could be expected, being well below the available time-frame of one hour. The estimated time for the worst case of daily ARX model fitting is 0.5 h, thus enabling that even both routines, the optimization and model fitting could be performed in just one hour. This leaves enough calculation capacity to either optimize further thermal zones, increase optimization frequency, increase the number of fitted black-box models or provide entirely different smart home services. The required energy demand for the operation of the RP3 is estimated in Eq. (13), assuming that the RP3 is operating in full load throughout the optimization and fitting routines and stays idle all the remaining time. The resulting energy demand of 3.7 kWhel is adjusted with the average PEF of the observed period (1.12) to calculate an estimated PE demand of 4.1 kWhPE for the operation of the RP3. This PE demand accounts for 7\u201316% of primary energy savings observed in the MPC controlled scenarios with dynamic comfort constraints, thus even in that worst case estimation of the computation effort, the MPC operation would be still beneficial. (13) W e l = ( 1416 o p t 59 d · 0.3 h load o p t + 59 f i t 59 d · 0.5 h load f i t ) · 4.4 W e l h l o a d + 962 h idle 59 d · 1.8 W e l h idle ≈ 3.7 k W h e l 59 d 5 Discussion 5.1 Viability of residential STM activation for LS activities STM activations have regularly absolute LS efficiencies well below 50%, being lower than values of 50\u201390% observed by [8,10,79] for individual STM activation phases of more than 12 h. Still, the clearly higher FE demand resulting from long phases with increased temperatures is overcompensated by the reduction of the average PEF. The scenario with the best balance between comfort and LS performance (O2b) in the regular building standard reaches a PE demand reduction of 7%, while maintaining the comfort level of the optimal comfort reference (R3). The application of MPC driven STM activations can be therefore recommended based on the defined boundary conditions. For the building with lower thermal standard (TIO 1984) the LS potential is very limited since the PE demand reduction is just 2%. Such a minor improvement might not outweigh the effort required to implement MPC based STM activation. Nevertheless, since the observed PE demand reduction come along with a minimization of comfort violations for that building standard, the application of MPC might still be considerable. Furthermore, the absolute amount of shifted FE equals 71% of the total FE demand of the PH reference scenario R3 (PH). Especially if LS activities are considered as potential grid services, such a large absolute energy shifting potential might be valuable. For the future oriented PH standard, a PE demand reduction of 15% is reached, while even limiting comfort violations. Thus, even though the absolute amount of shifted FE is rather low, it is clearly advisable to perform MPC based STM activations in such buildings. Although, this study proofs the proposed LS concept, considering that the results have been obtained for just two month of LS activities in a single room, the found percentages can only be seen as an indication of the potential performance. In addition to the impact of thermal standards evaluated in this work, other parameters can affect the LS potential of STM activation. Among others, the type of heating system, building materials, the occupancy schedule and the selected utility function (here PEF) will have strong impact upon the algorithms performance and resulting LS potential. Thus, before the results can be generalized to all residential buildings, several follow-up studies, favorably including field-tests, should be done. 5.2 MPC based on a simple ARX model Both the implemented simple black box model and the developed self-learning MPC algorithm proved to be functioning and together capable of controlling STM activations in a residential building zone without any prior model parametrization. Due to temperature fluctuations, self-induced by the algorithm\u2019s operation, the measurement data covers a wide range of possible thermal conditions and allows computing accurate ARX models based on very short fitting horizons. These short horizons are likely a reason for the good accuracy of the models, because the weather conditions of the fitting data are close to these in the predicted phase. The resulting models perform well when neither internal nor solar heat loads are present, while the prediction quality deteriorates when these impacts increase. It can be concluded that these models are best suitable for thermal zones with intermittent occupancy and particularly throughout seasons with limited solar irradiance. Both criteria can be assumed to be fulfilled for the observed case of residential LS in winter. However, it can be expected that the utilized black-box models would not perform similarly well if adapted for air conditioning based LS in summer or incorporated in zones with strong and hardly predictable internal loads. Generally, the performance of the model improves when the overall amount of uncontrollable temperature fluctuations decreases. This becomes evident in the sensitivity analysis, by the increasing share of MPC operation for the building with higher insulation standard and lower solar energy transmittance through the windows. If required for other cases of applications, the quality of the model could be significantly improved as suggested in several identification approaches by other authors [56,57]. However, in this work identifying a high-quality model was not required and not in focus. The less accurate model is compensated by a prediction quality estimation and a small (one-hour) step in recalculating the optimal heating schedule. Generally, the required frequency of re-optimization depends on the quality of the available predictions and is limited by the models complexity and resulting calculation times. In this study we show that even a very simple model with robust predictions can be beneficially used for STM activation. Due to that model simplicity the execution of the algorithm requires minimal calculation effort, whilst it is required to re-optimize more frequently. Taking a more sophisticated model would reduce the amount of required re-optimizations. It could be evaluated and discussed in future work, whether an optimum between model complexity and optimization frequency can be found. 5.3 Trade-off between comfort and LS Operation of the heating system according to dynamic temperature constraints generally increases the risk of temperature and temperature change violations. Nevertheless, the temperature profile of the dynamically controlled reference scenario R3 is on average closer to the defined optimal temperatures than the static scenario R1 or the set-back scenario R2. It can therefore be assumed that despite a slightly increased number of comfort violations, the overall thermal conditions are not worsened by the implementation of dynamic temperature profiles. The developed algorithm is generally capable of operating according to dynamic or conventional temperature constraints. Assuming the validity of the dynamic comfort constraints applied in this work [1], STM activations according to conventional comfort constraints are clearly not recommended, since the amount of comfort violations increased strongly in comparison with any other scenario. When STM activations are performed within dynamic comfort limits, the MPC can ensure or even improve the adherence to defined dynamic comfort constraints. This indicates that despite the increased control complexity resulting from a variety of dynamically changing temperatures and temperature change constraints, the simple MPC algorithm can manage both STM activations and comfort conditions. This corresponds with the expectations formulated for model predictive STM activation by [8,9]. However, it was found than an increasing comfort performance always reduces the viable LS potential, thus indicating a trade-off between strict comfort observance and the extent of feasible STM activations. The utilized dynamic PEF profile indicates the challenge of increasing PEF values in the evenings, when PV generation is discontinued, while the heating demand increases at the same time. Especially the higher dynamic comfort temperatures in the evening, driven by the assumed inactivity of the residents, can aggravate that imbalance. However, the developed MPC algorithm is capable to counterbalance that effect by shifting the heating demand to periods with lower PEF, typically earlier in the day. 6 Conclusion and future work In this work, an MPC algorithm was developed and used to control dynamic heating operation in one room of a simulated residential building. The algorithm aimed to optimize required heating operations according to a dynamic primary energy factor signal, while observing dynamic comfort constraints defined in a preceding experimental study [1]. One of the main objectives for the development of the MPC algorithm was such level of simplicity that implementing the suggested concept of MPC for STM activation in regular residential buildings would be possible without complex measurements, expert knowledge and expensive computations. Therefore, the developed algorithm utilizes a simple ARX black-box model, which is fitted and assessed based on few simple input signals. Several rule based reference scenarios and MPC operated optimized scenarios were compared, leading to the following key findings. \u2022 The observed absolute load shifting efficiency of the MPC algorithm was below 50% for all optimized scenarios, thus clearly increasing the required final energy demand. However, the algorithm can distinctly reduce the average PEF of the consumed energy, reaching up to 7% lower primary energy demands than the rule-based reference, for scenarios controlled according to dynamic comfort constraints. A trade-off between thermal comfort and the load shifting potential of STM activations was observed, which leaves potential for individual user specific calibration of the STM activation extent. \u2022 In comparison with conventional heating operation, any heating control according to the suggested dynamic comfort constraints increased the extent of comfort violations, due to the existence of the transition phases between the applicable constraints. However, on average the resulting temperatures of dynamically controlled heating operations were closer to the suggested optimal comfort temperatures. STM activations according to dynamic comfort constraints result in a similar or even lower extent of comfort violations than the optimal temperature oriented rule-based control according to these constraints. However, STM activations according to conventional standardized comfort constraints increase the extent of comfort violations distinctly. \u2022 The utilized simple black-box model could successfully predict thermal conditions within the observed room with sufficient quality to support MPC. The control algorithm based on that model was capable to activate STM as a measure of LS according to the given utility function. However, the model\u2019s prediction quality was found to be sensitive to dynamic internal and solar loads, therefore the suitability beyond the winterly residential scope is likely limited. \u2022 For buildings with lower insulation standard, only very small improvements of the primary energy efficiency can be reached, however the absolute amount of relocated final energy consumption is high. Buildings comparable to the Passive House standard have a clearly higher increases of primary energy efficiency, while only small absolute amounts of final energy consumption can be relocated. \u2022 The low computational effort of the developed MPC enables an implementation on simple and affordable hardware, as the Raspberry Pi 3. The primary energy demand resulting from the computations was estimated to be distinctly lower than the potential savings due to the utilization of the MPC. In summary, the general concept to perform STM activations in residential buildings is viable. However, to ensure thermal comfort of residents while maximizing the extent of STM activation potential, at least a simple MPC is required. The performance of such control depends on the knowledge about few resident-specific factors as the expected presence in the controlled zone or the current and expected activity level. Assumptions of these factors can be either static, or defined according to time-based schedules, ensuring at least an approximation of their impact. Just few rough assumptions indicating a repeatable daily occupancy and activity pattern, can enable meaningful load shifting activities and even improve comfort conditions. Furthermore, future smart building, communicating with the residents\u2019 smart appliances, could actually gain precise knowledge of these factors. Thus, it is likely that the potential for residential STM activations will increase in the future. Control algorithms for STM activation have to be further developed by improving the MPC models, adapting them for other heat delivery methods than hydraulic radiators, and evaluating different utility function types. Finally, since it was shown that the required control can be easily implemented utilizing simple hardware, field tests should be targeted.

        "dc:description": "Changes in the electricity supply system induce the challenge of matching the highly fluctuating and unpredictable renewable energy generation with the yet inflexible electricity demand. This leads to an increasing demand for energy storage and demand-flexibility. Electrification of residential heating systems in combination with advanced controls utilizing dynamically the structural thermal mass (STM) of buildings as thermal storage could provide some of the required demand flexibility. In this work, a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm is developed and applied within a simulation framework to control dynamic heating operation as a measure of STM based residential load shifting (LS). The self-learning algorithm is functional without extensive measurement data or expert knowledge for parametrization. It optimizes heating operations required for LS according to a dynamic primary energy factor signal, while observing transient thermal comfort constraints. The implemented auto-regressive black-box model with explanatory variables predicts thermal conditions within the observed thermal zone with sufficient quality to support MPC. Based on that model, the control algorithm successfully activates STM as a measure of LS according to the given primary energy (PE) oriented utility function. For the observed system, the PE demand can be reduced by 3\u20137% while maintaining or even improving the thermal comfort.",
