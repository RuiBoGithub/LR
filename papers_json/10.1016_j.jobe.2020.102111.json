Fault detection in heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems is essential because faults lead to energy wastage, shortened lifespan of equipment, and uncomfortable indoor environments. In this study, we proposed a data-driven fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) scheme for air handling units (AHUs) in building HVAC systems to enable reliable maintenance by considering undefined states. We aimed to determine whether a neural-network-based FDD model can provide significant inferences for input variables using the supervised auto-encoder (SAE). We evaluated the fitness of the proposed FDD model based on the reconstruction error of the SAE. In addition, fault diagnosis is only performed by the FDD model if it can provide significant inferences for input variables; otherwise, feedback regarding the FDD model is provided. The experimental data of ASHRAE RP-1312 were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme. Furthermore, we compared the performance of the proposed model with those of well-known data-driven approaches for fault diagnosis. Our results showed that the scheme can distinguish between undefined and defined data with high performance. Furthermore, the proposed scheme has a higher FDD performance for the defined states than that of the control models. Therefore, the proposed scheme can facilitate the maintenance of the AHU systems in building HVAC systems.

The faults of HVAC systems cause wastage of energy, shortened lifespan of equipment, and uncomfortable indoor environments [5\u20137]. In a commercial building in Hong Kong, 20.9% of all variable air volume (VAV) terminals of the HVAC system worked abnormally [8]. In a survey in the U.S., 65% of residential cooling systems and 71% of commercial cooling systems had faults [9]. Furthermore, an abnormal operation of air conditioning systems can cause approximately 5\u201330% increase in energy consumption [10\u201312]. Therefore, early detection of faults in HVAC systems is crucial, not only for comfortable indoor environments, but also for prevention of energy waste. In the last decades, a considerable amount of fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) methods have been developed for building energy systems, such as economizers, chillers, air handling units (AHUs), VAV terminals, and HVAC system level [13]. Conventional FDD models evaluate the system based on the discriminating equation and model pre-established through data analysis. However, HVAC systems, the AHU in particular, are a result of onsite construction and operate with various mechanical parts integrated in and connected to the building. Thus, it is difficult to standardize such systems because the equipment and physical composition are different depending on the site. Defining the faults of non-standard products requires considerable time and cost. Moreover, even if the faults for various states are defined, undefined states (operational conditions or faults of new patterns) that have not been pre-trained may occur because of variations of complex environmental factors, such as aging equipment, ambient temperature, and occupant behaviors. Based on these characteristics, it is difficult to provide sufficient training data that cover all possible situations for the FDD of the AHU system. Although excellent diagnostic performance can be achieved when an FDD model is predefined, for the reasons discussed above, frequent misclassifications may occur unless the undefined states generated in the AHU are considered, thereby decreasing the reliability of the model. Additionally, malfunctions and deterioration that can be detected early and counteracted may not be recognized, leading to increased future maintenance costs and excessive energy consumption. In the literature, various studies have attempted to address the limitation of training data. Keigo et al. [14] proposed a combination approach based on a semi-supervised method to identify building energy faults with limited labeled data by leveraging domain knowledge. Zhao et al. [15,16] proposed a diagnostic Bayesian networks-based method for AHU fault diagnosis. The proposed method simulates the FDD process of experts using physical laws, expert knowledge/experiences, operation and maintenance records, historical and real-time measurements, etc. Hence, the method does not require fault data. Yan et al. [17] proposed a semi-supervised learning FDD framework for AHUs to address the limitation of labeled data. The proposed framework was designed to secure the FDD performance of the model with a limited number of data by repeatedly inserting confidently labeled testing samples into the training pool. Yan et al. [18] proposed an AHU FDD framework using generative adversarial network (GAN) to handle insufficient amount of faulty training samples. The proposed framework re-balances the training dataset by enriching the faulty training samples using GAN. The re-balanced dataset is then used to train supervised classifiers. The aforementioned methods cannot structurally consider undefined states. Additionally, the reliability of the methods degrades when FDD is performed under the undefined state, and some methods have recently been developed to address this problem. Li et al. [19] proposed an expert knowledge-based unseen fault identification (EK-UFI) method to identify undefined faults by employing the similarities between known and unknown faults. Yan et al. [20] proposed an FDD framework for AHUs based on Hidden Markov models (HMMs) to handle undefined faults. To identify new fault types, a robust statistical method is developed to compare current HMM observations with those expected from existing states to obtain potential new types, and then confirm new types by checking whether the observations have a significant change. Although these methods can handle undefined states, they were designed to heavily rely on expert knowledge; hence, they require a deep understanding of the causal relationships between faults and symptoms of the building energy systems [13]. Therefore, in this study, we proposed a data-driven FDD scheme to enable reliable maintenance in the AHU by considering undefined states. The proposed scheme determines whether the FDD model can significantly infer input variables, and the FDD model performs fault diagnosis only when it can perform significant inferences on input variables; otherwise, the model considers the state of the system as undefined, and feedback is provided by retraining the FDD model. Through this process, the model can achieve desirable reliability in undefined states. 2 Proposed scheme The proposed FDD scheme has two objectives: 1) acquire search performance for the undefined state and 2) acquire the FDD performance for the defined state. Hence, the structure of the proposed scheme is illustrated in Fig. 1 . The scheme consists of three steps: 1) offline model preparation, 2) FDD by the model, and 3) model feedback. In the offline model preparation step, the FDD model is trained using the training database (DB), and the threshold is set to find the undefined state. In the FDD step, the state of the AHU system is determined by the FDD model. In the model feedback step, the training DB is updated by newly labeling the input data of the undefined state after manual system check. Then, the model preparation step for model retraining is performed. The fault diagnosis performance of the model can be enhanced by repeating the above steps. 2.1 FDD model The model inputs are the real-time monitoring data of the system, and the output is the system state judgment result (\u201cundefined state,\u201d \u201cfault-free,\u201d and \u201cfault\u201d). \u201cUndefined state\u201d is the output when the FDD model cannot perform significant inferences about the system state. \u201cFault-free\u201d and \u201cfault\u201d are the output in the defined state in which the model can determine the system status. \u201cFault-free\u201d is the output when the system has no fault. \u201cFault\u201d means that the system has a fault, and the fault type is the output. The model is composed of three parts: preprocessing, operation, and post-processing units. Algorithm. 1 details the pseudocode for the FDD step. Algorithm. 1 Pseudocode for the FDD step Image 1 2.1.1 Preprocessing unit The preprocessing unit processes the system monitoring data to a form appropriate for model input. Thus, data filtering through steady-state detection and standardization are performed. Steady-state detection is performed to filter the transient-state data that occur due to the operation, stopping, or change of the operation conditions of the air conditioning system. The transient-state data increase the complexity of the model and degrade FDD performance [21]. In this study, a steady-state filtering method [15,21\u201323] based on the change rate of the reference variable was used. Five reference variables were set as follows: cooling and heating coil control signal, SA duct statistic pressure, SA temperature, supply fan speed [15]. The steady-state indicator is the sum of the change rates of the reference variables. When the indicator exceeds the threshold, which is set in advance by referring to data under the steady-state, it is determined as transient-state with severe variation; when the indicator is lower than the threshold, it is determined as steady-state. Following data filtering, the data are standardized as (1) x ˆ i , j = x i , j − X \u203e j σ j (2) X \u203e j = 1 N ∑ i = 1 N x i , j (3) σ j = 1 N − 1 ∑ i = 1 N x i , j − X \u203e j where x ˆ i , j is the i th standardized value of the feature j , X \u203e j is the mean of the feature j , σ j is the standard deviation of the feature j , and x i , j is the i th value of the feature j . 2.1.2 Operation unit The operation unit derives the basic information required for FDD. The input values of the operation unit are the data processed by the preprocessing unit. The operation unit outputs two values, which are required to determine the system state. The first output value is the \u201cpredicted label\u201d (fault-free or fault type), which is used to determine the system state when FDD is possible. The second output value is \u201creliability for predicted label,\u201d which is used to determine whether the FDD model can perform significant inferences about the input variables. For the operation unit, the supervised auto-encoder (SAE) was applied, which is a type of artificial neural network (ANN); SAE jointly predicts target labels and reconstructs inputs [24]. The reconstruction function of inputs is the same as that of an auto-encoder. A reconstruction error of the auto-encoder can be used to identify anomalies [25]. The reconstruction error represents the difference between the inputs reconstructed by the auto-encoder and the original inputs. During training, the auto-encoder learns the relationships among the input variables to reconstruct the inputs. During testing, the auto-encoder accurately reconstructs the inputs when the correlations among the input variables are similar to those of the training data (low reconstruction error); otherwise, the inputs cannot be reconstructed accurately (high reconstruction error) [25]. Considering these characteristics, the reconstruction error of SAE was used as the reliability indicator for the predicted label. A low reconstruction error is derived in the defined state, for which the SAE was trained, and a high reconstruction error is derived in the undefined state, for which the SAE was not trained. When the reconstruction error is high, the predicted label of the operation unit is not reliable; thus, the FDD model cannot make a meaningful judgment. The structure of the operation unit is illustrated in Fig. 2 . SAE derives the predicted label and the reconstructed inputs while the operation unit derives the reconstruction error by calculating the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the reconstructed inputs and the original inputs. The SAE is composed of an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. The input layer receives input data from the preprocessing unit and delivers it to the hidden layer. Each node of the input layer represents the individual variable of the inputs. The hidden layer is the encoder, which extracts common features required for the reconstruction of inputs and the derivation of the predicted label and delivers them to the output layer. The output layer derives the predicted label using the information derived from the hidden layer and reconstructs the inputs. Thus, the output layer is composed of a classifier and decoder in parallel. The classifier receives the extracted features from the encoder, outputs the predicted label, and solves a multiclass classification problem. The decoder receives the extracted features from the encoder and reconstructs the inputs. Each node of the decoder represents individual variables of the reconstructed inputs. 2.1.3 Post-processing unit The post-processing unit finally determines the system state. The inputs of the post-processing unit are the data (predicted label and reliability for the predicted label) derived by the operation unit, and the output is the result of the system state judgment (\u201cUndefined state,\u201d \u201cfault-free,\u201d or \u201cfault\u201d). The post-processing unit determines that the predicted label of the operation unit is unreliable when the reliability for the predicted label (reconstruction error of SAE) exceeds the threshold (error tolerance limit); otherwise, it determines that the predicted label of the operation unit is reliable. The threshold is set based on the training data in the offline model preparation process. When the predicted label is unreliable, the post-processing unit determines that the model cannot diagnose the system state and finally derives the \u201cundefined state.\u201d Through this process, the model reduces the false alarm rate due to lack of training data. When the predicted label is reliable, the post-processing unit determines that the model can diagnose the system state and derives the predicted label as an FDD result. 2.2 Offline model preparation The model is prepared for FDD in the offline model preparation step, which is performed in two stages: 1) training of the operation unit and 2) setting the threshold for searching the undefined state. The pseudocode for the offline model preparation step is shown in Algorithm. 2 . Algorithm. 2 Pseudocode for the offline model preparation step Image 2 2.2.1 Training of the operation unit In the training process of the operation unit, the SAE of the operation unit is trained using the training DB. Here, the DB is built, the dataset is prepared, and SAE training is performed. The initial DB can be built through the building commissioning process; the initial DB consists of AHU monitoring data in the fault-free and fault states and the corresponding labels. The fault data can be obtained by simulating the faults that frequently occur in the AHU. Once the DB is built, the dataset for SAE training is prepared, for which data preprocessing and dataset division are performed. Data preprocessing is performed as in the preprocessing unit of the model. The pre-processed data are divided into training and validation datasets: the training set is used to optimize the parameters of SAE, and the validation set is used to prevent overfitting of SAE. During training, the parameters of the SAE are optimized for two tasks: reconstruction of inputs and derivation of predicted labels. The SAE training process is illustrated in Fig. 3 . l o s s a is the loss of the decoder, which is the mean squared error (MSE) of the original and reconstructed inputs; l o s s b is the loss of the classifier, which is the standard categorical cross-entropy (CCE) [26] for the target and predicted labels. These two losses are summed with the weights w a and w b to obtain the final loss. Training is performed to make the final loss close to 0. In this process, the weights and biases of the SAE are optimized to satisfy the two objectives of the predicted label derivation and input reconstruction. The epoch is set through early stopping to prevent overfitting [27]. 2.2.2 Threshold setting The threshold for finding the undefined state is set by the three-sigma rule [28] using Eq. (4), based on the reconstruction error of the training set. The threshold is adjusted appropriately whenever the training DB is updated. (4) t h r e s h o l d = X \u203e + 3 σ (5) X \u203e = 1 N ∑ i = 1 N x i (6) σ = 1 N − 1 ∑ i = 1 N x i − X \u203e 2 where t h r e s h o l d is the tolerance limit for the reconstruction error, X \u203e is the average reconstruction error of the training set, σ is the standard deviation of the training set reconstruction error, and x i is the reconstruction error of the i th data. The three-sigma rule states that \u201cfor normal distributions, 99.7% of observations will fall within three standard deviations of the mean\u201d [28]. Therefore, the threshold set by the three-sigma rule is a value covering most reconstruction errors for data in the defined states under the assumption that the reconstruction error follows a normal distribution. This is considered to be suitable for searching for undefined states. 2.3 Model feedback In the model feedback step, the training DB is updated for model retraining. If the FDD result of the model is \u201cundefined state,\u201d the state is defined through system check, and the data are newly labeled. Then, the labeled dataset is updated to the training DB. When the FDD result of the model is \u201cdefined state,\u201d the corresponding dataset is updated to the training DB. However, it is practically impossible to obtain a 0% error rate in a classification model in an actual application because some misclassified results based on outliers will inevitably occur. To combat this problem, the model feedback step is executed only when the same result persists for more than a certain number of iterations (n) in the FDD step. For example, if an output value in the FDD step is {\u201cfault-free,\u201d \u201cfault-free,\u201d \u201cfault-free,\u201d \u201cfault A,\u201d \u201cfault-free,\u201d \u201cfault-free,\u201d \u201cfault-free\u201d} in chronological order and n is set to three, then the data corresponding to \u201cfault A\u2033 are judged to be outliers and only the data corresponding to \u201cfault-free,\u201d excluding those corresponding to \u201cfault A,\u201d are used in the model feedback process. The objective of this feedback process is to secure model performance by continuously updating the training data. Once the training DB is updated, model retraining is performed. Model feedbacks are repeated with a specific cycle. The pseudocode for the model feedback step is shown in Algorithm. 3 . Algorithm. 3 Pseudocode for the model feedback step. Image 3 3 Scheme implementation The proposed FDD scheme was implemented in Python with TensorFlow. The scheme implementation process consists of FDD model building, operation unit training, and threshold setting. 3.1 Experimental data The proposed scheme was evaluated using the experimental data of ASHRAE 1312-RP. In 1312-RP, the major faults of the VAV system, which is a representative AHU system, were experimentally simulated, and the fault-free and fault data acquired from the experiment were provided [29]. Most studies on FDD for AHU have verified model performance using this data [15\u201317,19\u201322,30\u201333]. The 1312-RP project acquired fault-free and fault data from a facility comprising two AHUs and eight zones. Each AHU was in charge of four zones. AHU-A was used to acquire the fault data, and AHU-B was used to acquire the fault-free data for comparison. These two systems were configured with the same structure, and the used AHU is shown in Fig. 4 . The AHU is largely composed of fans, a cooling coil, a heating coil, coil control valves, various dampers, and sensors. The AHU is interconnected through four zones and ducts, and a VAV unit is installed in individual zones. The experiment of 1312-RP was performed in spring, summer, and winter. In each season, the fault states were simulated for 2\u20133 weeks. The faults were simulated manually in AHU-A. AHU-B was operated in the fault-free state for comparison. The system operation was scheduled to be occupied from 6:00 to 18:00, and the data were measured every minute. The proposed scheme was evaluated using data in summer and winter when the cooling/heating load is large. In summer, the supply air temperature was set to 55 °F, and the indoor temperature was maintained at 72 °F [35]. Fault-free data obtained from AHU-B account for approximately 56.1% (23 days) of the summer dataset. Additionally, 18 types of fault data obtained from AHU-B account for approximately 2.4% (daily) of the summer dataset. In winter, the supply air temperature was set to 65 °F, and the indoor temperature was maintained at 70 °F. The supply air static pressure set point was 1.4 psi for both summer and winter, and the supply fan was controlled accordingly. The return fan was operated with a speed tracking control sequence (80% of the supply fan speed) [35,36]. In winter, fault-free data accounted for approximately 62.5% (20 days) of the dataset, and 12 types of fault data accounted for approximately 3.1% (daily) of the dataset. The fault types and severities to be trained by the model were selected considering the ease of fault mimicry and time constraints during the building commissioning process. Seven major faults in each season were classified as defined states, and the other faults were classified as undefined states. The defined states are listed in Table 1 , which were used to evaluate the FDD performance for data from the defined state for which the model was trained. The other faults were undefined states, which were used to evaluate the search performance of data from the undefined state for which the model was not trained. The data were used after preprocessing, which was performed as described in Section 2.1.1. The threshold for the steady-state detection was set by referring to the slope of the steady-state section. The selected reference section for summer was 2008/9/4 14:00-18:00 [22] when the system was operated in the steady-state, and the selected reference section for winter was 2008/2/17 14:00-18:00. The threshold was set to three times the standard deviation of the sum of the slopes under steady-state conditions [22]. The filtered data were divided into three datasets after standardization. The first was the training set, which was used for model training. The second was the validation set, which was used to check whether the training was performed appropriately by determining the occurrence of overfitting in the model training process. The third was the test set, which was used to evaluate the performance of the trained model. The data were classified as shown in Table 2 . Considering the time constraint in the commissioning process, the fault-free data for three days were used for training. The fault-free data for 14 days were classified as the test set. The training and validation sets were randomly sampled with 80% and 20% of the fault-free data for training, respectively. All the data of the undefined states were classified as test set. The data of the defined states were randomly sampled with 60%, 20%, and 20% for the training, validation, and test sets, respectively. 3.2 Model building The first step in building the model is to select the input variables. When many types of input variables are needed for the model, the introduction cost and model complexity increase because of the increased number of sensors to be installed. Therefore, the appropriate input variables should be selected to minimize the number of required input variables while securing the accuracy of the model. In this study, 13 input variables were selected as shown in Table 4 based on the usual sensors installed in AHU [33] and potential sensors [22] that can be installed for FDD. Next, the hyperparameters required for implementing the SAE of the operation unit were set heuristically. The input layer consisted of 13 nodes, which was the same as the number of types of input variables. The encoder consisted of 300 nodes, and the rectified linear unit (ReLu) was used as the activation function of the encoder layer. In addition, batch-normalization and dropout were applied for generalization performance [37,38]. The classifier consisted of eight nodes, and each node denoted the fault-free state and seven faults. The softmax function [39] was applied as the activation function of the classifier. The decoder comprised 13 nodes, which is the same number of the input variable types, and each node represents the reconstructed input variable. The linear unit was applied as the activation function of the decoder. 3.3 Operation unit training The operation unit was trained using the training process proposed in Section 2.2.1. The model for the cooling mode of the AHU system was trained using the summer data, and for the heating mode, the model was trained using the winter data individually. The hyperparameters required for training were configured through an empirical method using a validation set, as shown in Table 5 . Figs. 5 and 6 illustrate the operation unit training results of summer and winter, respectively. They depict losses according to the epoch of the training and validation sets. It can be seen that as the training progressed, the losses of the training and validation sets approached zero, indicating that the training of the operation unit was performed appropriately. 3.4 Threshold setting The threshold was set after training of the operation unit by applying the three-sigma rule to the reconstruction error of the training set. Figs. 7 and 8 show the reconstruction error distribution and threshold of each model. The solid line indicates the reconstruction error distribution of the training set, which is expressed as the kernel density estimate. The dashed line indicates the reconstruction error distribution of the validation set. The one-point dashed line indicates the threshold. Most of the validation set reconstruction errors were lower than the threshold. This means that the validation set was the data of defined states, and the FDD model can significantly infer the input variables of the validation set. 4 Performance evaluation The performance of the proposed FDD scheme was evaluated in this section. The following two evaluation factors were set considering the purpose of the model: 1) is the search performance for the undefined state secured? 2) is the FDD performance for the defined state secured? 4.1 Evaluation method 4.1.1 Evaluation scenario The scenario was established as shown in Table 3 to evaluate the model. S1 and W1 are the scenarios for verifying the second evaluation factor (is the FDD performance for the defined state secured?). S1 and W1 include the data of the types of fault-free and defined states for summer and winter, respectively. S2 and W2 are the scenarios for verifying the first evaluation factor (is the search performance for the undefined state secured?). S2 comprises S2-1 to S2-11, which include data for the 11 undefined states of summer. W2 comprises W2-1 to W2-5, which include data for five undefined states of winter. 4.1.2 Performance evaluation metrics The performance of the proposed scheme was measured in terms of the precision, sensitivity, and F1 score given as (7) p r e c i s i o n = T P T P + F P (8) s e n s i t i v i t y = T P T P + F N (9) F 1 s c o r e = 2 ⋅ p r e c i s i o n ⋅ s e n s i t i v i t y p r e c i s i o n + s e n s i t i v i t y where true positive (TP) is the case of correct classification of the actual true data by the model, false positive (FP) is the case where actual false data are misclassified as true by the model, and false negative (FN) is the case where actual true data are misclassified as false by the model. Positive denotes the data with the targeted labels while negative denotes the data with all other labels [21]. Precision means the ratio of data samples that are actually positive among the data samples that were determined as positive by the model. Sensitivity is the ratio of data samples that were determined as positive among the actually positive data. The F1 score expresses the model performance as a number when the number of data by category is unbalanced. The F1 score is calculated by the weighted harmonic mean of precision and sensitivity. In scenarios S1 and W1, the FDD performance of the model for the data of defined states was evaluated by precision, sensitivity, and F1 score. Higher values of these three indices indicate a more excellent model performance. The final performance of the model was evaluated using the mean of the index for each label. In scenarios S2 and W2, sensitivity was used to evaluate whether the model can find undefined states. A higher sensitivity means that the model can find the undefined states accurately (higher search performance). 4.1.3 Control model The FDD performance of the model for the data of defined states was comparatively evaluated against a model based on support vector machine (SVM) and another based on an ANN. The SVM-based model performed FDD using the radial basis function (RBF) kernel SVM. The hyperparameter of the SVM-based model was set through grid search. The ANN-based model used multi-layer perceptron including one hidden layer comprising 300 nodes. An exponential linear unit (ELU) was used as the activation function of the hidden layer of the ANN. A softmax function was used as the activation function of the output layer to perform multiclass classification. 4.2 Evaluation results 4.2.1 Search performance for undefined states The first objective of the proposed scheme is to secure the search performance for the undefined states. Hence, scenarios S2 and W2 composed of undefined states were established, and the evaluation results are shown below. Figs. 9 and 10 illustrate the sensitivity of the FDD model for undefined states in summer and winter, respectively. Sensitivity means the ratio of data samples that were determined as the undefined state by the FDD model among data samples from the actually undefined state. A higher sensitivity means that the model can find the undefined states accurately (higher search performance). For every scenario, the proposed scheme showed a sensitivity of 0.9 or higher. The mean sensitivities for summer and winter were 0.987 and 0.956, respectively. This means that the proposed scheme searched the data of undefined states in summer and winter well at the probabilities of approximately 98.7% and 95.6%, respectively. This confirms that the proposed scheme achieved the first objective. 4.2.2 FDD performance for defined states The second objective of the proposed scheme is to achieve FDD performance for the defined states. Thus, scenarios S1 and W1 were established, and the evaluation results are as follows. Table 6 presents the FDD result for scenario S1. \u201cFault-free\u201d indicates a normal state with no fault, and \u201cFault 1\u201d to \u201cFault 7\u201d indicate the trained faults. The last row indicates the mean value of the index for each label. Every result was evaluated using the mean value after 30 repeated tests. For every value, a value close to 1 means good performance, and a value close to 0 means poor performance. In terms of precision, the proposed scheme showed better performance than that of the control models in general. In particular, it showed higher precision than that of the control models for faults 5 and 7. The mean precision was 0.99, which means that 99% of the labels predicted by the proposed scheme were correct. The mean sensitivity was 0.969, which means that the proposed scheme could diagnose the correct fault type at the probability of approximately 97% when defined states occurred. The mean F1 score was 0.978, which is higher by approximately 0.1 than the control models because of the relatively high precision. This means that the proposed scheme showed better FDD performance than the control models for the defined states. Table 7 shows the FDD results for scenario W1. The proposed scheme showed higher precision than that of the control models in every label except faults 3 and 5. The performance difference was particularly large for fault 6. The mean precision was 0.965, which means that 96.5% of the results predicted by the proposed scheme were correct. The mean sensitivity was 0.971, which means that the proposed scheme correctly diagnosed the data of defined states at a probability of approximately 97% on an average. The mean F1 score was 0.968, indicating a higher performance than that of the control models. The evaluation results for scenarios S1 and W1 showed that the proposed scheme had a higher FDD performance than that of the control models for defined states, confirming that the second objective was achieved. 5 Conclusion In this paper, a data-driven FDD scheme was proposed for considering undefined states to enable reliable maintenance in the AHU. The proposed scheme was designed to determine whether the FDD model based on a NN can make significant inferences for input variables using the SAE. In the proposed scheme, the FDD model performs fault diagnosis only in the case where the reconstruction error of the SAE is within the error tolerance limit. Otherwise, the feedback of the FDD model is performed through retraining of the inputs. Scenario-based performance evaluation was performed using the experimental data of ASHRAE RP-1312. The proposed scheme was compared with well-known data-driven approaches to test its capabilities on fault diagnosis. The FDD model correctly searched the fault data of undefined states in summer and winter at the probabilities of 98.7% and 95.6%, respectively. This means that the proposed scheme can distinguish the data of undefined and defined states with high performance. For the fault-free and fault data of the defined states, the proposed model showed F1 scores of 0.978 and 0.968 in summer and winter, respectively. This suggests that the proposed scheme has a higher FDD performance for the defined states than that of the control models. Therefore, the proposed scheme can perform reliable FDD on the AHU system by taking into account undefined situations, and it is expected to facilitate the maintenance of AHU systems.

        "dc:description": "Fault detection in heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems is essential because faults lead to energy wastage, shortened lifespan of equipment, and uncomfortable indoor environments. In this study, we proposed a data-driven fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) scheme for air handling units (AHUs) in building HVAC systems to enable reliable maintenance by considering undefined states. We aimed to determine whether a neural-network-based FDD model can provide significant inferences for input variables using the supervised auto-encoder (SAE). We evaluated the fitness of the proposed FDD model based on the reconstruction error of the SAE. In addition, fault diagnosis is only performed by the FDD model if it can provide significant inferences for input variables; otherwise, feedback regarding the FDD model is provided. The experimental data of ASHRAE RP-1312 were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme. Furthermore, we compared the performance of the proposed model with those of well-known data-driven approaches for fault diagnosis. Our results showed that the scheme can distinguish between undefined and defined data with high performance. Furthermore, the proposed scheme has a higher FDD performance for the defined states than that of the control models. Therefore, the proposed scheme can facilitate the maintenance of the AHU systems in building HVAC systems.",
