Department of Industrial Management, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, 108, Taiwan. Department of Industrial Management National Taiwan University of Science and Technology Taipei 108 Taiwan Building air condition and mechanical ventilation (ACMV) systems which provide cooling operations suffers from the balance between thermal comfort (TC) and energy consumption (EC). This study presents a multi-objective optimization model that resolves the trade-off between TC and EC. Four operating variables are selected as decision variables because they significantly affect TC and EC. Firstly, the component power consumption pattern of the ACMV system (that is, fan, pump, and compressor) is built by a semi-empirical model. Then EC is modeled as a function of the component power consumption pattern and air temperature. Secondly, TC is modeled as a function of environmental, personal, and human-robot collaboration variables. Thirdly, an artificial neural network (ANN) was constructed as a prediction model of TC and EC. Then, ANN is coupled with multi-objective whale optimization algorithm for optimization of decision variables. Sensitivity analysis was carried out to examine the variation of decision variables. Experiment result shows that (1) the proposed ANN for TC and EC exhibits high performance with a goodness-of-fit of 98.83% and 98.25% respectively. (2) The optimization model reduces a 16.51% of EC and improves TC by 49.06% as compared to the reference operation. This study successfully builds a multi-objective optimization model of an ACMV system for TC and EC.

Appropriate TC setting largely depends on the physiological situation of the residents as well as the type of their activities [2]. How to maintain indoor TC for people has increasingly got attention [3] as 90% of the daily time people spend indoors [4]. Air condition and mechanical ventilation (ACMV), which is commonly used for space cooling, account 40%\u201360% of entire building energy consumption to maintain TC [5,6]. Despite energy spent to ensure TC, building occupants\u2019 thermal dissatisfaction reports are widespread [1,7]. The discrepancy between TC and energy consumption (EC) due to the two conflicting objectives needs to be throughout deliberated. TC and EC are two major concerns of the ACMV system [8,9]. This situation needs to be effectively managed in the ACMV system operations [10]. Studies on the ACMV system can be divided into two categories (1) comfort-driven control (i.e., comfort prioritized over energy): and (2) energy-consumption control (i.e., energy prioritized over comfort). A summarized previous research on ACMV system and their considered factors are shown in Table 1 . In the first category, TC requirement is prioritized over EC, resulting EC objective left unmet (e.g., Refs. [15,18\u201320,23,24,26,28,29]). Zhang et al. [15] explored TC in terms of supply airflow rate and indoor air temperature to achieve preferred thermal conditions in occupied zone. Aryal and Becerik-Gerber [28] studied occupant thermal satisfaction using zone level temperature setpoint. They showed that a TC-driven zone temperature setpoint adjustment improves thermal satisfaction with reduced EC. Chaudhuri et al. [20] proposed a comfort-driven framework for indoor TC control. Their framework comprises of a TC prediction and an optimization algorithm for indoor air temperature control. Zhang et al. [18,19] studied TC for stratum ventilation using air flowrate, supply and exit air temperature. Deng and Chen [23] examined the overall TC in multi-occupant offices based on environmental and personal factors. Kaushik et al. [29] investigated TC using relative humidity, mean radiant temperature, indoor air temperature, air velocity, and clothing insulation. Palladino et al. [24] proposed an algorithm for TC estimation considering indoor air temperature, relative humidity and clothing insulation. They showed that the accuracy of the proposed TC is better than the conventional one. Zahid et al. [26] proposed a dynamic TC model by combining building information and modeling (BIM) with Internet of things (IoT) sensors. They demonstrated the integration advantage of BIM models for geometric and parametric information and IoT sensors for real-time streaming of environmental data (humidity, temperature, etc.) to optimize the indoor thermal comfort. In the second category, EC requirement is prioritized over TC. TC criterion is left unmet because few comfort factors are considered (e.g., Refs. [11\u201313,16,21,27]. Acosta et al. [11] predicted EC using cooling loads of air-conditioning system. Zhai et al. [12,13] explored energy efficiency improvement of ACMV system considering operating parameters, indoor air temperature and skin temperature. In another paper, Zhai et al. [16] examined EC of ACMV system by integrated predictive thermal state model with their proposed ACMV operating state algorithm. They showed that a 13.5% energy saving can be achieved by the prosed method. Dong et al. [21] explored EC potential at different control strategies for air pump system. Afroz et al. [27], presented a simulation-based modeling and optimization approach to explore EC by optimal control setting (i.e., indoor air temperature setpoint, supply air temperature setpoint, supply air duct static pressure set point of the air handling units (AHUs) without compromising indoor environmental condition. Table 1 also highlights some limitations of previous studies on integrating operating, environmental, personal, and human robot collaboration (HRC) factors to assess TC and EC as multi-objective optimization problem (e.g., Refs. [14,22,25]. Zhai and Soh [14] proposed a modeling and optimization approach for an ACMV system to locate global optimal operating points and predict energy-saving rate. According to their experimental evaluation result on the optimization algorithms, the sparse augmented firefly algorithm was found to be more efficient than the sparse firefly algorithm. Satrio et al. [22], used a multi-objective genetic algorithm for a two-chiller system considering operating and environmental factors. Wu et al. [25] proposed a multi-objective optimization model for an active chilled beam system using environmental and personal factors. The most common limitation of previously proposed models was that they did not consider HRC factors concerning TC modeling. Obviously, a trade-off control model that caters both TC and EC can be a remarkable solution remains a research gap to be resolved. Occupant TC is mainly influenced by environmental, personal, and facilities-related human factors such as HRC [30]. Notably, TC proposed by Wang et al. [17] was the only study considering HRC factors (i.e., robot speed, proximity, position of delivery, and robot arm). They estimated TC based on HRC factors when the robot assists the human partner in the assembly tasks. The result demonstrates that TC is significantly affected by robot performance. However, HRC factors are only considered for TC estimation. EC is influenced by the ACMV system operating parameters and indoor thermal conditions [20]. To attain the TC of occupant while minimizing EC of the ACMV system, the trade-off control strategy should incorporate all major driving factors. Consequently, to assess such a trade-off, it is necessary to not only explore the independent effects but also to elucidate synergistic effects. However, a trade-off control strategy as a multi-objective optimization problem by integrating those factors (i.e., operating, environmental, personal, and HRC factors) was not fully addressed yet [31]. Therefore, in this study a multi-objective optimization model as a trade-off control in a human-machine coexisting environment is proposed by considering operating, environmental, personal, and HRC factors. Built on the existing reviews towards the ACMV system, this article aims to present a multi-objective optimization model that can trade-off TC and EC. Particularly, the following research questions are addressed. (1) How to establish the nonlinear property in TC and EC mapping with influencing factors? (2) How to achieve the optimal solution set considering TC and EC simultaneously? (3) How to conduct the trade\u2013off decision under various decision variables? The novelty and originality of the present study lies in three parts: (1) developing a multi-objective optimization model to trade-off TC and EC of the ACMV system. As a result, first, the component power consumption pattern of the ACMV system is represented by a semi-empirical model. Then, an EC model is developed as a function of component power consumption pattern and indoor air temperature. Second, differing from conventional TC model where environmental and personal are major concerns, the proposed TC model considers environmental, personal along with HRC factors. (2) Artificial neural network (ANN) is adopted as a fitness function in the optimization model to offset low accuracy. The proposed ANN model replaces the conventional multi-objective mathematical function and enables the mapping relationship between output objectives with corresponding input factors. (3) ANN coupled with multi-objective whale optimization algorithm (MOWOA) is proposed for solving the optimization of TC and EC. Finally, we validate the efficacy of the proposed model using an HRC scenario and demonstrate the flexibility of the proposed model under various decision variable settings. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents TC and EC models. Section 3 develops the multi-objective optimization model for the ACMV system and describes HRC based experiment design, data collection, and ANN modeling. Section 4 presents the experiment results and discussion. Lastly, section 5 provides the conclusions. 2 Modeling of energy conservation and thermal comfort 2.1 Modeling of energy conservation In the ACMV system, Air Handling Unit (AHU) is used to condition the mixed inlet outside fresh air with return air according to cooling demand and then supplied into the room, as illustrated in Fig. 1 . The energy-consuming functions of the ACMV systems consist of chilled water circulation and refrigerant circulation for heat transferring within the AHU system. For chilled water circulation, the chiller uses the water pump to circulate the chilled water through the evaporator and cooling coil of AHU. When the chilled water passes through the evaporator, heat absorbed from the circulating water flows to the cooling coil unit. As the air blow over the cooling unit, the system transfers heat from circulating air to chilled water, and then the fan supplies air into the room. The refrigerant circulation loop includes high and low-pressure sides. At high pressure, the compressor helps provide appropriate pressure to increase the vapor refrigerant and continuous circulation of refrigerant in the compression cycle. The condenser changes the refrigerant from vapor into liquid form to release heat. At low pressure, the evaporator provides heat transferring between water and liquid form refrigerant to generate chilled water. Then the liquid form refrigerant that received the heat transferred from water becomes a vapor and returns to the compressor for the next circulation. The power consumption from AHU and water chiller unit (WCU) mainly depends on indoor thermal condition. Once the AHU start operating, the condenser operates at constant power rate. In this study, component power consumption pattern of the ACMV system (that is, fan, pump, and compressor) changes due to indoor thermal condition only. We used the component power consumed for cooling demand along with indoor thermal condition as input parameters for modeling EC in the ACMV system. The operating points of the ACMV system component which are selected as input parameters for EC modeling are principally based on the following reasons. Firstly, indoor air temperature is a key indicator of the indoor thermal environment. Secondly, the AHU fan is a major part that provides conditioned air into the room. The rate of supply air affects AHU fan power consumption [32]. Thirdly, the water pump for water-circulation and compressor for refrigerant-circulation is responsible for a cooling system. These main components are significant for EC for cooling operations. The power consumption of component ( P c l ) from fan, water pump, and compressor is calculated as stated in Eq (1). (1) P c l = P f a n + P p u m p + P c o m p where P f a n , P p u m p , P c o m p are the power consumed for fans, water pump and compressor. The fan and water pump power consumption for variable speed drive is defined as Eqs. (2) and (3) [33]. (2) P f a n = ( ρ a . V ˙ a . D a , p ) η f a n (3) P p u m p = ( ρ w . V ˙ w . g . D w , p ) η p u m p where ρ a , V ˙ a , D a , p , η f a n are the air density (kg/m3), volume of airflow rate (m3/s), and differential pressure (Pa), and fan efficiency respectively; ρ w , V ˙ w , D w , p , η p u m p are the water density (kg/m3), volume of water flow rate (m3/s), differential head (m), and pump efficiency respectively; g is the gravity (9.81 m/s2). The compressor power consumption for air compression ( P c o m p ) is calculated as Eq. (4) [34]. (4) P c o m p = [ 144 N P 1 V k / ( 3300 ( k − 1 ) ) ] [ ( P 2 P 1 ) ( k − 1 N k ) − 1 ] η c o m p where N is the number of compression stage (1 in this study), P 1 and P 2 are the pressures of the condenser and evaporator of the refrigeration cycle (psi), V is the volume of air at atmospheric pressure (ft3/min), k is the coefficient of adiabatic expansion (k = 1.41), and η c o m p is the compressor efficiency. In the formula P c o m p is in hp unit (1hp = 745.7 W). Therefore, the EC ( E C t o t a l ) model in an ACMV system is a function of its component power consumption, operating parameter setpoint, and indoor air temperature as defined by Eq. (5) [35]. (5) E C t o t a l = Y ˆ ( V ˙ a , V ˙ w , T s a , T a , P c l ) where Y ˆ represents an ANN model in the present study for Eq. (5) because a close form did not exist [20]. V ˙ a , V ˙ w , T s a , T a , P c l are the volume of airflow rate, volume of water flow rate, supply air temperature, indoor air temperature and power consumed for cooling operation respectively. 2.2 Modeling of thermal comfort Predictive mean vote (PMV) model, targeting minimization, is commonly used for estimating TC [36,37]. According to ISO 7730 [53], the TC categories based on PMV value is shown in Table 2 . PMV value closer to 0 indicating higher TC satisfaction. In previous research, a simplified PMV model considered personal (i.e., cloth insulation, metabolic rate) [38,39], and environmental factors (indoor air temperature, relative humidity, air velocity, supply air temperature) [15]. Additionally, personal TC is also affected by HRC factors (i.e., robot speed) that should be considered in PMV calculation [30]. Current field base studies reveal that the oversimplification of factors considered in original PMV model results in a bias between the predicted PMV and actual thermal sensation [40]. Another simplification made in the original PMV model is sweat rate calculation, which is assumed to only depend on metabolic rate and independence of environmental parameter, resulting in a deviation occur between the expected PMV value and actual thermal sensation [41]. By this simplification introduced in the original PMV, studies showed that the deficiency of estimating TC in a warm environment [42]. Consequently, several studies have been conducted to promote or adjust the model by incorporating factors such as adaptive coefficient [35], and modify the sweat rate calculation in the original PMV for enhancing TC prediction in warm climates [43]. In the present study, we proposed a PMV model for TC analysis by taking the advantages of existing PMV models along with HRC factors. In a human-machine coexisting environment, the human is an interactive participant rather than being simply a passive recipient of the thermal environment. The proposed PMV model for TC analysis based on a human-machine coexisting environment is evaluated as a function of environmental, personal and robot speed factors, expressed as Eq. (6). (6) P M V = Y ˆ ( M , I c l , R H , T a , T r , T s a , v a , S r ) where Y ˆ will be represented as an ANN model for Eq. (6), M is the metabolic rate (met), I c l is the cloth insulation (clo, 1clo = 0.155 m 2 . °C / w ), RH is the relative humidity (%), T r is the mean radiant temperature ( °C ), T a is the indoor air temperature ( °C ), v a is air velocity (m/s), and S r is the robot speed. To quantify the effect of environmental and HRC factors on PMV, a regression model is constructed using filed data, as shown in Eq. (7) and Table 3 . The p-value of less than 0.05 indicates a significant impact on the response variable. The results show that the indoor air temperature and robot speed have the highest impact (i.e., p-value = 0.00) on the response variable. When the indoor air temperature increases by 1 °C , PMV increases by 0.1267 unit. Similarly, when the robot speed increases by 1%, PMV increases by 0.05349 unit. It also produced an adjusted R-square of 98.98%, indicating a significant relationship between the response variable and independent factors. (7) P M V = − 1.452 + 0.1267 T a − 0.0353 T r − 0.0222 v a + 0.051 R H − 0.0136 T s a + 0.05349 S r By a field test, a relationship of robot speed, indoor air temperature, and PMV at 50% RH is illustrated in Fig. 2 . It shows that both indoor air temperature and robot speed significantly affect PMV. When indoor air temperature and robot speed increases, PMV goes up. Thereby, robot speed should be considered to improve occupant TC in addition to environmental factors. 3 Proposed multi-objective optimization model The proposed multi-objective optimization framework is depicted in Fig. 3 . Indoor air temperature, relative humidity, supply air temperature, volume of airflow rate and water flow rate are selected as control variables. Regarding indoor air temperature and relative humidity, Fanger [36] proposed the PMV model for estimating TC. It considers four environmental factors (indoor air temperature, relative humidity, radiant temperature and air velocity) and two personal factors (i.e., cloth insulation, metabolic rate) [36]. Amongst six thermal comfort factors, indoor air temperature and relative humidity have higher influence on thermal comfort [24]. Therefore, indoor air temperature and relative humidity are considered as control variables for examining their variation impact on the TC. Further, the ANN model is built as the estimation model of TC and EC. Constraints are imposed on control variables to achieve feasible solutions for the proposed model. Then, TC and EC objectives are optimized (trade-off) using a multi-objective whale optimization algorithm (MOWOA). 3.1 Modeling The multi-objective optimization model is expressed as Eq. (8). (8) Min V ˙ a , V ˙ w , T a , T s a [ g 1 ( x ) , g 2 ( x ) ] T where g 1 ( x ) is EC of the ACMV system, g 2 ( x ) is TC. g 1 ( x ) = E C t o t a l ( V ˙ a , V ˙ w , T s a , T a , P c l ) , g 2 ( x ) = | P M V ( M , I c l , R H , T a , T r , T s a , v a , S r ) | and x is the input variable vectors for EC and TC (i.e., for TC, x = [ M , I c l , R H , T a , T r , T s a , v a ] and for EC, x = [ V ˙ a , V ˙ w , T s a , T a , P c l ] ). Subject to: constraints Eqs. 9\u201313, as stated below. For each decision variables (control variables), their minimum and maximum values are considered as lower and upper bound for optimization model, respectively. To maintain the indoor thermal condition, a constraint is imposed on operating control variable according to ASHARE standard 62.1 [44]. Therefore, the optimization model constraint conditions expressed as: 1. Airflow rate constraint: the minimum and maximum volume of airflow rate is set based on the fan motor capacity. (9) V ˙ a , min ≤ V ˙ a ≤ V ˙ a , max 2. Water flow rate constraint: the lower and upper bound of water flow rate is set based on pump frequency. (10) V ˙ w , min ≤ V ˙ w ≤ V ˙ w , max 3. Supply air temperature constraint (11) T s a , min ≤ T s a ≤ T s a , max 4. Indoor air temperature constraint (12) T a , min ≤ T a ≤ T a , max 5. Robot speed constraint (13) S r , min ≤ S r ≤ S r , max 3.2 Solution algorithm of the proposed optimization model ANN is used for mapping a complex relationship between input factors and output objectives. Studies proved that ANN in a good position to estimate PMV [45] and EC [46\u201349]. Thus, PMV and EC models are built in the study by ANN. For the PMV-ANN model, assuming that X p m v k = [ M , I c l , R H , T a , T r , T s a , v a ] is the input vector and P M V k is the PMV output for kth vector of n sample set, the PMV-ANN model can be formulated as Eqs. 14\u201316. (14) V i k = φ ( ∑ j = 1 h w i j X p m v k − b i ) (15) P M V k = ( ∑ i = 1 h V i k W i − B i ) (16) M A E P M V = ∑ i = 1 n | P M V k − P M V k ˆ | n where V i k is the hidden neuron output i , φ ( . ) is the activation function, w i j is the weight of input neuron of j for hidden layer neuron i , b i is the hidden neuron bias i , h is the hidden neuron numbers, W i is the weight of hidden neuron output i , B is the output neuron bias, the mean absolute error (MAE) of PMV, P M V k is the measured value of PMV for kth vector and P M V k ˆ is the ANN output of value of the kth vector. For EC-ANN model, assume that X E C k = [ V ˙ a , V ˙ w , T s a , T a , P c l ] is input vector and E C k is the EC output for kth vector of n sample set, then the EC-ANN model can be formulated as Eqs. 17\u201319. (17) V i k = φ ( ∑ j = 1 h w i j X E C k − b i ) (18) E C k = ( ∑ i = 1 h V i k W i − B i ) (19) M A E E C = ∑ i = 1 n | E C k − E C k ˆ | n where V i k is the hidden neuron output i , φ ( . ) is the activation function, w i j is the weight of input neuron of j for hidden layer neuron i , b i is the hidden neuron bias i , h is the hidden neuron numbers, W i is the weight of hidden neuron output i , B is the output neuron bias and the mean absolute error (MAE) of EC, the mean absolute error (MAE) of EC, E C k is the measured value of EC for kth vector and E C k ˆ is the ANN output of value of the kth vector. After establishing the complex correlation between PMV and EC with corresponding driving factors by a well-trained ANN model, MOWOA is used for multi-objective optimization solution algorithm to improve PMV and reduce EC. As a result, the trained ANN models for PMV and EC are used as a fitness function in optimization to replace the unknown exact function between output objectives with their driving factors. The computational framework for MOWOA is shown in Fig. 4 . The MOWOA consists of initialization, MOWOA optimizer mechanism and finalization stages as described Mirjalili and Lewis [50]. 1. Set up the algorithm parameters and generate the initial population, then the first offspring population is obtained by utilizing the MOWOA optimizer mechanism namely, encircling prey, bubble-net attacking, prey search, and selection. 2. Calculate the fineness value and keep the current optimal solution. 3. Update the algorithm parameters and a new population is produced using the MOWOA optimizer mechanism. Then calculate the new population fitness value and keep the current optimal solution. 4. Steps 2 and 3 are repeated until the maximum number of generations and obtain a set of Pareto optimal solutions. 3.3 Implementation and experiment 3.3.1 Implementation setting To validate the optimization method, HRC based experiment and data measurement were carried out in a robotic laboratory of National Taiwan University of Science and Technology. The human acts as a partner with the robot in the smart assembly process of motherboard and graphics processing unit (GPU) fan. A measurement is carried out for human TC analysis in this HRC assembly process having two zones: picking and assembly areas. GPU fan components are located in picking area where the robot is able to access them. In assembly area, the assembly operation for motherboard and GPU fan component is performed by human and robot collaboratively, as illustrated in Fig. 5 . The experiment was designed on the basis of a controllable and observable situation. It is performed on the MiniBOT industrial robot with a standard 6-axis package built for education is presented in Fig. 5. The MiniBOT industrial robot has an operating range: 595 mm (maximum), repeatability: ± 0.12 mm, rated payload: 1 kg, degree of Freedom: 6, and driving system: EtherCAT close-loop stepper. We conduct 30 rounds of collaborative task to collect experimental data. Each round of experiment lasts for 40 min, where 10 min for room pre-conditioning and 30 min for subject thermal condition survey. According to our experiment observations, for those samples less than 10 min, the thermal sate is not usually stabilized and would lead to a wrong prediction. Further, before starting the experiment, we spend 1 min to introduce matters that needs attention to the subject. To avoid human bias on measurement, the human subject is also pre-conditioned before the experiment for 5 min. The human subject performs two tasks: (1) Handling the GPU fan and motherboard and then placed into picking area. (2) Screwing/assembling the motherboard with the GPU fan by collaborating with the robot. 3.3.2 Data collection A measurement of data from environmental and personal parameters were done using sensors, as illustrated in Fig. 6 and Table 4 (a). The ACMV system supplies fresh air to circulate the indoor thermal condition. The airflow rate is a key parameter that determine the cooling load and supply fresh air which varies along outside air condition. Thereby, the minimum required airflow rate should be set to ensure TC, indoor air quality (IAQ) and to minimize EC. According to ASHRAE standard 62.1\u20132010 [44], the ventilation rate requirement is determined by taking occupant or room area. The general airflow rate solution is set as 2.5 L/s/person for a given floor area of room 0.3 L/s/m2. The dimension of the lab room floor area is 5 m × 4 m = 20 m2. Therefore, the minimum required airflow rate for ventilation can be determined as 0.011 m3/s (=2.5 × 2 + 0.3 × 20) by assuming 2 people in the room. The minimum fresh airflow rate supplied from the ACMV system is set as 0.011 m3/s. The other predefined parameters used for the ACMV system are shown in Table 4(b). The multi-objective optimization model constraints are shown in Table 4(c). 3.3.3 ANN training ANN toolbox in MATLAB is used to build and train ANN models. The ANNs input parameters are the collected data of influencing factors, and outputs are PMV and EC objectives as described in Section 3.2. A total of 400 samples for PMV and EC were grouped into ratio 70%:15%:15% for training, validation and test datasets respectively. All computations are performed using MATLAB® software (version R2019) and Intel® Core™i5-7200 CPU @ 2.50 GHz computer with 8 GB RAM. Five training algorithms was tested to train the ANN model, the Levenberg-Marquardt over-performs than others and shows the least MAE and largest R 2 , as indicated in Table 5 . Therefore, Levenberg-Marquardt are selected for training ANN models of PMV and EC, as illustrated in Appendix 1. 3.4 Model validation For further validation, the proposed model is compared with the original PMV model [43] and experimental data (i.e. subject's actual TC self-reported in experiments), as shown in Fig. 7 . The red line presents the estimated TC based on the original PMV model which uses personal and environmental data. The blue line presents the estimated TC by the proposed model which uses personal, environmental, and robot speed data. The proposed model has a good alignment with the experimental data than the original PMV model. As shown in Fig. 7(a), when the indoor air temperature setpoint varies from 21 to 28 °C, the proposed model estimates better and closer to the experimental data than the original PMV model. As seen in Fig. 7(b), when the robot speed varies from 10 to 70% of maximum speed, the proposed model demonstrates better agreement with the experimental data than the original PMV model. This is because of the proposed model considers more associated factors and resolves the over-simplifications made in the original PMV model. 4 Results and discussion 4.1 Individual operating variable effect on PMV and EC 4.1.1 Effect of indoor air temperature and relative humidity Fig. 8 illustrates the indoor air temperature and relative humidity changing effect on PMV and EC. The variation of those parameters leads to PMV and EC fluctuation. The indoor air temperature and relative humidity varied from 21 to 28 °C and 40%\u201368% respectively while other parameter set at optimum value. When indoor air temperature and relative humidity increase, the energy demand to maintain indoor air temperature within the comfortable range decreased. This is because of when the temperature and relative humidity difference between their setpoint and indoor air temperature is small, the EC for ACMV system for cooling and dehumidification operation becomes less. Subsequently, a variation of setpoint in temperature and humidity results in PMV to increase. 4.1.2 Effect of airflow rate and supply air temperature Fig. 9 displays the volume of airflow rate and supply air temperature variation effect on PMV and EC. Also, the performance of the AHUs is highly affected by volume of airflow rate and supply air temperature. This is because of the amount of airflow rate of AHUs is a significant role in ensuring the indoor air quality (IAQ), indoor TC and EC. The variation of those key parameter creates to a variation in heat removal and EC of the AHUs system. As shown in Fig. 9(a), when supply air temperature setpoint varies from 14 to 21 °C by setting other parameter constant, the chiller energy required to maintain indoor air temperature decreases. This is because of chiller workload depends on the temperature gap between supply air temperature and indoor air temperature. The EC from the chiller is less, as the supply air temperature becomes higher resulting lower workload on chiller and vice versa. Moreover, when supply air temperature increase, PMV increases because of slowing cooling process. When the difference between supply air temperature and indoor air temperature setpoint is moderate, more time takes to achieve indoor air temperature comfort. Accordingly, if higher supply air temperature is provided, the air temperature moves further way from indoor air temperature comfort range which results in PMV to increase. Otherwise, a low supply air temperature results in PMV to decrease. As seen in Fig. 9(b), when the volume of airflow rate was varied from 0.011 to 0.091 m3/s, result a fluctuation of PMV and EC. However, the change observed in EC is very small as compared to PMV. Furthermore, AHUs fan EC for air circulation is not dominant as compared to other component EC of ACMV system. It can be noted the variation of volume of airflow rate has a significantly impact on PMV than EC. Conversely, if the volume of airflow rate is not optimal, AHUs fan will consume more EC and the room will have IAQ problem. 4.1.3 Effect of water flow rate Fig. 10 illustrates the effect of water flow rate of WCU variation on PMV and EC. The changing of velocity from 2 to 9 m3/s leads a fluctuation on PMV and EC. As the volume of water flow rate increases, pump EC for circulating the chilled water through evaporator and cooling coil of AHU is higher. However, an increase in the volume of water flowrate causes a negative impact on the indoor air temperature (i.e., PMV decreases). It is clear that when the volume of water flow rate increases, the temperature difference between supply air and indoor air temperature is low, then the time takes to achieve indoor air temperature comfort is less (i.e., there will be a fast cooling process). 4.2 Synergetic effect of operating variables on PMV and EC The operating variables investigated in the study include water and airflow rates and supply and indoor air temperatures. Fig. 11 (a) illustrates the combined variation effect of volume of water and airflow rates on PMV and EC. The volume of water and airflow rates varied from 2 to 9 m3/s and 0.011\u20130.091 m3/s respectively leads a fluctuation on PMV and EC. When the volume of water and airflow rates increases, the energy required to remove heat from the AHUs circulating air increases. However, an increase in volume of water and air flowrates causes PMV to decrease resulting more TC. This is because of when volume of water and airflow rates increases, there is a fast cooling process to achieve indoor air temperature. Since the volume of water and airflow rates mainly affects indoor air quality, indoor TC and EC, if those parameters are not optimal, it can cause thermal discomfort and excess EC. Fig. 11(b) elucidates the synergetic variation of supply air temperature and air temperature on PMV and EC. The supply air temperature varies from 14 to 21 °C while indoor air temperature variation changes 21\u201328 °C to which results in a shift of PMV and EC. When the supply air temperature and air temperatures increase, the AHUs fan energy required to maintain indoor TC decreases. This is because of AHUs fan workload depends on the temperature gap between supply air temperature and indoor air temperature. 4.3 Multiple objective trade-off by Pareto frontier analysis The optimization of the PMV and EC for the ACMV system using five control variables in the HRC process was done by MOWOA. Fig. 12 illustrates the non-dominated Pareto solution curve for the multi-objective optimization results for PMV and EC, indicating that the conflicting nature of the two objectives. An increase in PMV value from 0.1 to 0.6 led to a decrease in the EC from 1350 kW h to 200 kWh. The highest EC and minimum PMV value (i.e., maximum TC) is shown at point A. Conversely, the lowest EC and maximum PMV value (i.e., minimum TC) is shown at point C. If energy-saving is the target objective (i.e., EC prioritized over TC) point C solution would be chosen, while if TC is the priority objective (i.e., TC prioritized over EC), point A solution would be chosen. Point B is the trade-off solution with PMV and EC of 0.24 and 489 kWh respectively. Table 6 shows the resulting optimal control variables and the optimization results for PMV and EC. The base case is the existing room thermal condition (i.e., reference operation) before the experiment. According to ISO 7730 standards, the base case and point C conforms class C representing the lowest TC satisfaction level which is the least requirement for indoor thermal environment condition. Point A conforms class A representing a highest TC satisfaction towards thermal condition. Point B conforms class B representing a moderate satisfaction level for thermal condition. 4.4 Comparison of solution algorithms To validate the proposed optimization model for the trade-offs between the TC and EC, the proposed ANN-MOWOA compared with the well-known non-dominated genetic optimization algorithm (NSGA-II) to justify the performance. Likewise, NSGA-II was applied to the well-trained ANN models. To improve accuracy and reduce computation time, the considered algorithm parameter tuned are defined as follows: In NSGA-II set as [500, 200, 0.9, and 0.1] [51,52] are the maximum generation, population size, crossover rate, and mutation rate respectively. Population type: double vector and selection method: tournament. MOWOA set as [500, 200, 2, and 1] [50] are the maximum generation, search agent, convergence factor, and spiral shape constant respectively. The comparison of the non-dominated curve set for MOWOA and NSGA-II performance are shown in Fig. 13 and Table 7 . The non-dominated curve set obtained by the MOWOA is below than that of NSGA-II indicating the MOWOA provides best solution. 5 Conclusion In this study, a multi-objective optimization model to trade-off the TC and EC of the ACMV system was proposed to enrich the novity of ACMV control. Indoor air temperature, supply air temperature, airflow rate, and water flow rate were determined as decision variables to optimize TC and EC simultaneously. Owing to the inherent high complexity within the system, ANN models were developed to model the relationship between TC and EC with their influencing variables. Then, ANN models regarded as fitness function and MOWOA is applied for seeking decision variables to simultaneously optimize TC and EC. The optimization model achieves a good trade-off between TC and EC of the ACMV system. The main conclusion can be summarized as: 1) The R-square of ANN models Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm for TC and EC are 98.83% and 98.25% respectively presented better performance than others training algorithm. 2) The importance of coupling ANN with MOWOA as a solution methodology lies in understanding the robust interaction between operating variable settings with trade-off objectives. 3) A set of sensitivity analysis were carried out to quantify the effect of decision variables on PMV and EC. The indoor air temperature and water flow rate have significant impact on EC. 4) The proposed PMV model not only improves accuracy but also resolves the overestimation in original PMV model. It is noteworthy that the proposed PMV model by introducing HRC factors along original PMV model enlarges the applications of TC analysis. 5) The optimization model achieves a 16.51% of EC and improves TC by 49.06% as compared to the reference operation by controlling water and airflow rates and indoor air temperature. The proposed model can be used as alternative tool to effectively manage the ACMV system control strategy. Several interesting extensions may be incorporated into future research. In terms of influencing factors of TC and EC, building geometry is worthy to survey in the future investigation. The effect of the position of air conditioning in the room and the airflow direction controlled by the louver in the air conditioning can be further investigated. Other HRC factors such as proximity and position of delivery can be examined. In terms of methodology, bi-layer stochastic modeling to investigate a combined effect of outdoor and indoor environmental factors on the EC of ACMV systems is promising for future studies. Instead of the ANN-MOWOA solution methodology, using ANN coupled with strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm-II (ANN-SPEA-II), Pareto envelope based selection algorithm-II (ANN-PESA-II) is worthy of being studied further.

        "dc:description": "Building air condition and mechanical ventilation (ACMV) systems which provide cooling operations suffers from the balance between thermal comfort (TC) and energy consumption (EC). This study presents a multi-objective optimization model that resolves the trade-off between TC and EC. Four operating variables are selected as decision variables because they significantly affect TC and EC. Firstly, the component power consumption pattern of the ACMV system (that is, fan, pump, and compressor) is built by a semi-empirical model. Then EC is modeled as a function of the component power consumption pattern and air temperature. Secondly, TC is modeled as a function of environmental, personal, and human-robot collaboration variables. Thirdly, an artificial neural network (ANN) was constructed as a prediction model of TC and EC. Then, ANN is coupled with multi-objective whale optimization algorithm for optimization of decision variables. Sensitivity analysis was carried out to examine the variation of decision variables. Experiment result shows that (1) the proposed ANN for TC and EC exhibits high performance with a goodness-of-fit of 98.83% and 98.25% respectively. (2) The optimization model reduces a 16.51% of EC and improves TC by 49.06% as compared to the reference operation. This study successfully builds a multi-objective optimization model of an ACMV system for TC and EC.",
