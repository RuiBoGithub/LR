Handling Editor: X Zhao Space heating accounts for a large proportion of a building's energy consumption, and improving heating efficiency is a significant approach to reduce heating energy consumption and carbon emissions. To improve heating efficiency and meet the demand for thermal comfort, this paper proposes an adaptive model predictive control (AMPC) based heating control strategy to regulate the heating parameters of heat exchange stations in residential communities. A multi-input non-linear model combined with subspace identification algorithms is constructed using the heating data from the heat exchange stations and meteorological data. An AMPC control system, a model predictive control (MPC) and a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control system, are then built to compare their control performances such as room temperature control accuracy, energy saving capacity, response speed, and robustness under extreme weather. The results show that the AMPC strategy outperforms the other two, with a 67.5% reduction in room temperature control deviation and a 20.3% reduction in energy consumption compared to the actual operation of the heating plant. Under extreme weather conditions, the AMPC strategy has 44% less deviation in indoor temperature control and a shorter response time than the least effective PID control strategy of the three. The AMPC system has broad application prospects in the heating field.

In developed countries, building energy consumption accounts for 20%\u201340% of the total energy consumption, and 40% of thisamount is consumed by heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) [2]. In northern Chinese cities, heating energy consumption accounts for 21% of building energy consumption. In the next 10 years, the energy consumption and total carbon emissions for heating in China will be twice as high as at present [3]. Thus, reducing heating energy consumption is essential to decreasing total building energy consumption and carbon emissions. The lowest-cost energy-saving solution is optimizing the control strategy to achieve on-demand heating [4]. Currently, the most widely used classical control method in the heating field is proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control. However, as a univariate input control approach, this method cannot meet the requirements for smart heating because of low accuracy of temperature control and the absence of energy-saving optimization functions [5\u20138]. Therefore, scholars have applied emerging algorithms, such as artificial neural network algorithms, genetic algorithms, and neuro-fuzzy algorithms, to centralized heating systems, which has resulted in continuous improvement of the energy efficiency and thermal comfort of heating systems [9\u201314]. However, maximizing thermal comfort and minimizing energy use and computational resources are two conflicting goals. The ideal solution for resolving this conflict is model predictive control (MPC) [15,16]. MPC can minimize cost functions by using predictive models to optimize a range of predictions [17]. MPC can provide flexible control that coordinates multiple control objectives based on an optimization formulation, unlike traditional PID control strategies designed to meet a single control objective [18]. Moreover, MPC has great potential to reduce energy use and associated greenhouse gas emissions while maintaining and improving thermal comfort [19\u201322]. For example, regarding energy consumption as the primary control objective, Lee et al.\u2018s [23] heating operation trials using MPC resulted in 12% energy savings compared to a simple on/off thermostat control strategy. Siroký et al. [24] saved 17%\u201324% energy compared to weather compensators. Taking thermal comfort as the main optimization objective, the distributed model predictive control (DMPC) proposed by Morosan et al. [25] was found to improve thermal comfort by 36.7% compared to PI control ]. Provan et al. [26] compared the stochastic model predictive control (SMPC) algorithm with the PI control strategy, and found that the algorithm could improve thermal comfort by 38.3%. However, few scholars have considered these objectives simultaneously and analyzed the performance of predictive controllers, such as control response time and the ability to cope with climate change. Building a predictive model is a key component of MPC and has a great impact on the performance of predictive control [27]. There are two main ways to build predictive models: white-box modeling and black-box modeling. Compared to the original rule control strategy, the MPC operation by Juan Hou et al. [28] using the resistance-capacitance (R\u2013C) white-box model reduced heating energy consumption by 2.8% and peak heating power by 8.8%. Yang et al. [29] used R-C-modeled MPC to considerably improve the comfort of room heating. Although the white-box modeling method is highly accurate, it is difficult to accurately estimate the large number of parameters related to building and system properties; moreover, this method cannot be generalized to large buildings [30]. As Internet of Things technologies have become commonplace for measuring and storing data in buildings, data-driven modeling approaches have become prospective [31]. For example, Lindeloef et al. [32] used the MPC of the black-box model based on the neural network algorithm to save approximately 24%\u201332% of heating energy in the actual operation of the heating system. Similarly, in Smarra's [33] study, MPC modeled with random forests saved 49% of the energy compared to a bang-bang controller. However, black-box models are often affected by the quantity and quality of the data. The types and quantities of input parameters of these two black-box models are relatively small, leading to insufficient model prediction goodness-of-fit. Furthermore, a building is a highly dynamic system with uncertain and time-varying physical properties, leading to predictions using a time-independent simplified building model that may have large errors in building responses over long control periods [34]. Using building operation data, such as control signals and weather conditions measured before MPC is put into operation to calibrate the building model once, the model prediction accuracy can be improved considerably [35]. With the continuous application of the state-space modeling method in the HVAC field [36], new methods are provided to address the above problems. .To realize the overall regulation of heating for residential communities, this paper proposes a subspace identification modeled adaptive model predictive control (AMPC) strategy to regulating the supply water parameters of the heat exchange station The outdoor temperature, solar radiation, wind speed, indoor temperature, secondary network flow, and secondary water supply temperature are incorporated into the influencing factors of heating control to develop a black-box model. This modeled AMPC uses historical operation data from the past week to optimize and update in a rolling manner to ensure the accuracy and robustness of MPC, further reduce the control response time and improve the temperature control accuracy. A technical route of this research is shown in Fig. 1 . 2 Methodology In this section, the methods used in this study, including the basic principles of the subspace identification method, the basic principles of AMPC, the data processing methods, and the construction methods of heating simulation systems, are introduced. 2.1 Principle of the subspace identification method The subspace identification method is a new type of system identification method that appeared in the early 1990s [37], which can be traced back to the state space theory of the early 1960s. AMPC requires a changing predictive model, and the state-space model fitted by subspace identification can be exactly used as the predictive model. For subspace identification, we first need to build a state space model, whose state space equation can be expressed as follows: x ( k + 1 ) = A x ( k ) + B u ( k ) + w ( k ) (1) y ( k ) = C x ( k ) + D u ( k ) + v ( k ) , where x(k) ∈ R N ，u(k) ∈ R r ，and y(k) ∈ R m are the state vector, input vector and output vector of the system, respectively; w ( k ) ∈ R N and v ( k ) ∈ R m represent the process noise and the measurement noise of the system; and A, B, C, and D are the system matrices corresponding to the determined state space basis. Then, the identification problem can be described as the input and output data sequence {u(k), y(k)} generated by the given system, and the system matrix (A, B, C, and D) can be estimated using the system identification method. Assuming that k is the current moment, (1) can deduce the output of the future moment f: (2) y f = Γ f x ( k ) + H f u f + G f w f + v f . The stack vector y f and Toeplitz matrix Γ f at the future f-time are shown in (3), and forms of the observable matrix H f and G f are shown in (2)-(4): y = [ y ( k ) y ( k + 1 ) \u2026 y ( k + f − 1 ] T (3) Γ f = [ C C A \u2026 C A f − 1 ] T (4) H f = [ D 0 \u2026 0 C B D \u2026 0 ⋮ C A f − 2 B ⋮ C A f − 3 B ⋱ ⋮ ⋯ 0 ] G f = [ D 0 \u2026 0 C 0 \u2026 0 ⋮ C A f − 2 ⋮ C A f − 3 ⋱ ⋮ ⋯ 0 ] . The rest of the stacking vectors such as w f , v f , and u f are defined in the same way as y f , which makes it possible to write future output equations as expressions of Hankel matrices: (5) y f = Γ f X f + H f U f + G f W f + V f . The Hankel matrix of output y f is in the form of: (6) Y f = [ y ( k ) y ( k + 1 ) \u2026 y ( N − f + 1 ) y ( k + 1 ) y ( k + 2 ) \u2026 y ( N − f + 2 ) ⋮ y ( k + f − 1 ) ⋮ y ( k + 1 ) ⋱ ⋮ ⋯ y ( N ) ] . The Hanker matrix representation of the input and noise at future moments can be analogous to y f , and the future state vector matrix is as follows: (7) X f = [ x ( k ) x ( k + 1 ) \u2026 x ( N − f + 1 ) ] T . The basic principles of the Hankel matrix of the subspace identification algorithm are introduced above, and the next step is to calculate the matrix of the system. Subspace identification first calculates the estimation of the state vector: X ˆ k = [ x ˆ ( k ) x ˆ ( k + 1 ) \u2026 x ˆ ( N − f ) ] (8) X ˆ k + 1 = [ x ˆ ( k + 1 ) x ˆ ( k + 2 ) \u2026 x ˆ ( N − f + 1 ) ] . Then the system matrix is estimated by using the least squares method to obtain the system matrices A, B, C, and D: (9) [ X ˆ k + 1 Y k ] = [ A B C D ] [ X ˆ k U k ] + [ ρ w ρ ] . After the state vector and the system matrix of the system are obtained, the model parameters are known, and the identification algorithm ends. 2.2 Principles of MPC and AMPC MPC uses the system model to predict the future state of the system, generate a control vector, and minimize the optimization of a cost function within the forecast range in the presence of interference and constraints. At any sampling moment, the first element of the control vector calculated by the algorithm is applied to the system input, and the remaining data are discarded. The next process repeats the process during the initial time period. The cost function can be combined with multiple factors such as error tracking, energy consumption cost, and demand cost, and these factors affect the cost function through different weight allocation. The MPC control process consists of two basic steps: The first step is to use information provided by the model about past inputs, outputs, and future signals to be calculated to predict future outputs in an open-loop manner. The objective function can be optimized to calculate the future control signal, usually in the form of a quadratic function standard. The second step is to send the first part of the optimal control sequence u (k) to the system while discarding the remaining sequences. At the next moment, the new output y (k + 1) is measured, the control sequence is recalculated, the first component of u (k + 1) is applied to the system, and the rest is discarded. In heating control, the reference trajectory y r ( k ) is a pre-known parameter in this paper. The main advantage of MPC is the ability to predict the calculation of y ( k ) and the corresponding input signal u ( k ) , which can avoid the undesirable effects of sudden changes in the control signal and delays in the system response. The optimization objective function of the MPC is as follows: (10) J = ∑ k = 0 N − 1 q ( k ) ( y ( k ) − y r ( k ) ) 2 + r ( k ) u ( k ) 2 , where q(k) is the weight of the difference between the output y(k) of the system and the reference y r ( k ) of time k, and r(k) is the weight of the displacement of the control signal u(k). If the expected output value of the future is known in advance, the criterion results in an optimal system input, which minimizes the weighted squares of y(k)-yr(k). After such control, the system output below the target value is disposed the same as the system output above the target value. The most intuitive method is to adjust the weights over time depending on the change in the reference trajectory. When the reference trajectory is in the upper layer, the weight is set to q(k), which is greater than r(k), and in other cases, q(k) is set to less than r(k). The MPC problem can often be expressed as a linear, time-invariant discrete-time deterministic model: (11) x ( k + 1 ) = A x ( k ) + B u ( k ) y ( k ) = C x ( k ) + D u ( k ) . The optimal control sequence for the predicted range is then found by minimizing the objective function: (12) J = ∑ k − 0 N − 1 q ( k ) ( y ( k ) − z ( k ) ) 2 + r ( k ) u ( k ) 2 The restrictions are as follows: (13) u min ≤ u ( k ) ≤ u max y r ( k ) ≤ z ( k ) ， Δ max ≥ | u ( k ) − u ( k − 1 ) | , where u min and u max are the minimum and maximum values of the control signal, respectively, and y r ( k ) is the expected value, and its upper bound is z ( k ) . Δ max is the maximum value that controls the magnitude by which the signal can vary. Formula (4) can be rewritten in matrix form: (14) j = ( y − z ) T Q ( y − z ) + u T R u , where Q and R represent the weighted matrix of output error and control effort, respectively. The output trajectory is: (15) [ y ( 0 ) y ( 1 ) ⋮ y ( N − 1 ) ] = [ C C A ⋮ C A N − 1 ] x ( 0 ) [ D C B D ⋮ ⋱ C A N − 2 B \u2026 C B D ] [ u ( 0 ) u ( 1 ) ⋮ u ( N − 1 ) ] And (16) y = Γ x ( 0 ) + H u . where Γ is the observable matrix and H is the pulse effect matrix. At this point, let y \u203e = Γ x ( 0 ) , and then combined with formula (6), formula (5) can be evolved to: (17) j = ( y ∼ + H u − z ) T Q ( y ∼ + H u − z ) + u T R u , The minimization of this formula is a nonlinear programming problem that can be easily rewritten as a quadratic programming problem: (18) J = [ u T z T ] [ H T Q H + R − H T Q − Q H Q ] [ u z ] + 2 [ y \u203e T Q H − y ∼ T Q ] [ u z ] + y ∼ T Q y \u203e . This creates an optimization problem, and minimizing J can be solved efficiently with a computer. Each process solves the optimization equation to produce the optimal solution output, forming a control loop. MPC employs a linear time-invariant dynamic model to predict future behavior. In practice, such predictions are prone to bias due to various disturbances and changes in model parameters. AMPC addresses this degradation problem by adapting the predictive model to changing operating conditions, as shown in Fig. 2 . AMPC can use a fixed-model structure, but it allows the model parameters to change over time. Ideally, when the controller needs to make predictions, it uses a model that is appropriate for the current situation. The object model used for AMPC must be the linear time invariant (LTI) discrete-time, state -space model. The model is roughly structured as follows: (19) x ( k + 1 ) = A x ( k ) + B u u ( k ) + B v v ( k ) + B d d ( k ) y ( k ) = C x ( k ) + D v v ( k ) + D d d ( k ) . Matrix A , B u , B v , B d , C , D v and D d are time-varying parameters. The other variables in the formula are as follows: k is the time index, x is the model state, u is the manipulation input, v is the measured interference input, d is the unmeasured interference input, and y is the model output. There are certain differences between AMPC and MPC in terms of nominal points. A traditional MPC controller contains a nominal operating point at which the object model applies, for example by using a linearized nonlinear model to obtain an approximation of the LTI. In AMPC, over time, the operating points of the nominal values must be updated in a timely manner to be consistent with the updated model. Therefore, the control model can be written according to the deviation from the nominal condition: (20) x ( k + 1 ) = x \u203e + A ( x ( k ) − x \u203e ) + B ( u t ( k ) − u \u203e t ) + Δ x \u203e y ( k ) = y \u203e + C ( x ( k ) − x \u203e ) + D ( u t ( k ) − u \u203e t ) , where x \u203e is the nominal status; Δ x \u203e is the nominal state increment; u \u203e t is the nominal input; y \u203e is the nominal output. The nominal input is the initial condition of the predictive model in AMPC, and the last set of the latest data used to update the predictive model is used as the nominal input. For state estimation, AMPC applies a Kalman filter to adjust the gain matrices L and M at each control interval to maintain consistency with the updated object model, which means AMPC uses a linear time-varying Kalman filter (LTVKF): (21) L k = ( A k P k ∣ k − 1 C m , k T + N ) ( C m , k P k ∣ k − 1 C m , k T + R ) − 1 M k = P k ∣ k − 1 C m , k T ( C m , k P k ∣ k − 1 C m , k T + R ) − 1 P k + 1 ∣ k = A k P k ∣ k − 1 A k T − ( A k P k ∣ k − 1 C m , k T + N ) L k T + Q . Here, Q, R, and N are the covariance matrices defined in the MPC state estimation. A k and C m , k T are the state space parameter matrices for the entire controller state, but the part affected by the model is updated to time k. P k + 1 ∣ k is a covariance matrix based on the time k-state estimation error of the information available at time k+1. L k and M k are the updated KF gain matrices. The state error covariance matrix and the KF gain are determined by the assumptions of the Q, R, and N matrices and the model parameters. If the object model is constant, the expressions L k and M k converge to the equivalent static KF solution used in the MPC. The equation for controller state evolution at time k is the same as the KF formula for the MPC described in controller state estimation, but the estimator gain and the state space matrix are updated to time k. The controller state can be updated by using a program outside the MPC controller, and then the updated state is provided to the MPC at each control moment k. In this case, the MPC controller skips all KF and LTVKF for calculations. As the building characteristics are affected by many uncertainties, it presents a strong nonlinear state in the real heat transfer process; therefore, this paper attempts to use AMPC to control the central heating system in real time. 2.3 Data processing methods The factors affecting the indoor temperature of a building can be divided into two types. One is the time-by-hour data of the secondary water supply temperature and the secondary flow of the heating system, which were obtained from the heating data of a residential heat exchange station in Cangzhou City, Hebei Province, in the winter of 2019. The other is outdoor meteorological parameters, such as solar radiation, outdoor temperature, and outdoor wind speed, which were obtained from the local meteorological station website. For the indoor temperature for model fit verification was performed by rationally selecting 23 representative monitoring points. To reduce unnecessary workloads, some variables that had little impact on room temperature changes were eliminated through correlation analysis. For long-term monitoring data, there are problems such as missing data, data outliers and noise, and data drift, which were processed using the sliding average filtering (SAF) algorithm and then used for modeling. When the correlation of the two variables is affected by other variables and cannot be directly determined, variables that interfere with the correlation of the two variables must be excluded. For example, when analyzing the correlation between the secondary water supply temperature and the indoor temperature, a partial correlation analysis must be used to eliminate the influence of solar radiation and the secondary water supply flow. The partial correlation analysis can be calculated as follows: When the data contain k (k > 2) variables x 1 , x 2 , \u2026, x k , the equation for the bias correlation coefficients of any two variables x i and x j \u2032 s g (g ≤ k-2) order samples is (22) r i j l 1 l 2 \u2026 l g = r i j l 1 l 2 \u2026 l g − 1 − r i j l 1 l 2 \u2026 l g r i j l 1 l 2 \u2026 l g − 1 ( 1 − r i j l 1 l 2 \u2026 l g − 1 2 ) ( 1 − r i j l 1 l 2 \u2026 l g − 1 2 ) . In this paper, goodness of fit is considered a key indicator of the model response and can be defined as follows: (23) f i t = ( 1 − ∑ ( Y i − Y ˆ ) 2 ∑ ( Y i − Y \u203e ) 2 ) , where Y i represents the model output, Y \u203e represents the average of Y i , and Y ˆ represents the actual measurement data. The value of this metric is proportional to how well the model matches the actual operation. 2.4 Simulation system construction method To compare the performances of the three control strategies, PID, MPC, and AMPC control systems are implemented in Python 3.6. The specific construction steps are as follows. First, the MPC module implemented in Python. Then, the basic prediction model is imported into the MPC controller, and the secondary water supply temperature is used as the operation variable that the MPC calculates. Data such as outdoor temperature and solar radiation are used as measurable disturbance types. The room temperature data are set to the measurement output type for control. After the MPC controller is set up, a running data module and a controlled object module are set up to build a complete simulation heating system. The AMPC controller adopts the same basic prediction model as the MPC controller; AMPC focuses on the construction of the prediction model update module. The key step is to update the basic parameters A, B, C, and D of AMPC's internal prediction model and the nominal values of the model U, X, Y, and DX with historical data from the previous week. Finally, the control system based on the PID module is used for comparison, because the PID controller without a prediction model is relatively simple, and only the internal parameters must be adjusted. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Filtered results for model input parameters This study aims to compare the room temperature control accuracy, energy saving ability, response speed, and robustness of AMPC, MPC, and PID simulation control systems in central heating. Thus, three main mathematical models must be built: the thermal dynamic response model, which reflects the temperature change in the building room; the energy consumption analysis model, which obtains the return water temperature to calculate the energy consumption level of the building; and the predictive control model inside the MPC controller. Considering that room temperature change is a slow and lengthy process, and the sampling time is too short to cause a significant decline in the performance of the controller [38], in this study, the model is constructed using the data obtained from a 1 h sampling interval. To build these three models, it is necessary to analyze the data types necessary to fit the three models above. In terms of the water supply parameters, the temperature of the water supply and the secondary supply flow have the most significant impact on building heating. For the meteorological parameters, solar radiation intensity, outdoor temperature, and wind speed have the maximum impact [39,40]. The bias correlation coefficients of the outdoor temperature, secondary water supply temperature, secondary water supply flow, outdoor wind speed and indoor temperature are 0.62, 0.53, 0.44 and 0.21, respectively. Therefore, the outdoor temperature, secondary water supply temperature, and secondary flow can be confirmed as the inputs required for the fitting model. Due to the discontinuity of the solar radiation data, correlation analysis cannot be applied here, and whether this parameter can be incorporated into the model input must be determined using the goodness of fit analysis. Comparing the output average room temperature with the measured data, the quality of the fitting effect can be analyzed to determine which parameters have a greater impact on the construction of the thermal dynamic model. The fitting results for the different input groupings are shown in Table 1 . Thus, the four parameters of water supply temperature, outdoor temperature, secondary flow data, and solar radiation are determined to be the input factors required for model fitting. 3.1.1 Modeling input data processing results The hour-by-hour outdoor solar radiation intensity and outdoor temperature data are obtained from authoritative meteorological websites, which means that the data are of good quality and do not need to be processed, as shown in Figs. 3 and 4 . The secondary supply and return water parameters collected from the heat exchange station often have a series of problems, such as missing data and outliers; thus, they cannot be used directly to fit the model before being processed. The processing scheme involves interpolating the missing values of the data first and then removing as many outliers in the data as possible by using the filtering algorithm. The results for the SAF treatment of the water supply temperature, where the same method is applied to supply water flow data and the average indoor temperature of the collected monitoring points, are shown in Fig. 5 . 3.2 Model-building results For the thermal dynamic response model and the energy consumption model, the fitting method involves sorting out the data obtained from the previous processing, extracting 70% of the data, using the subspace identification algorithm to fit the model, and then using the remaining 30% of the data for testing. For the prediction model, to use as much data as possible for the simulation comparison, the first 168 h of data are used as historical data to build a basic prediction model. 3.2.1 Thermal dynamic response model construction results In the process of building a thermal dynamic response model, solar radiation, outdoor temperature, processed secondary water supply temperature, and secondary flow data are used as inputs, and the processed indoor temperature data are used as the output. The canonical variate analysis (CVA) identification algorithm is used to obtain a fourth-order state space model. The main parameters are A (4 × 4 matrix), B (4 × 4 matrix), C (1 × 4 matrix), D (1 × 4 matrix), and X0 (4 × 1 matrix). As 70% of the data used to fit the model are randomly screened, the plausibility of the model must be tested to prevent the fitting effect from being inaccurate due to contingency. The model's response is verified with the remaining 30% of the data, and the fitting detection process is repeated 10 times to test the effectiveness of this modeling method in an averaged manner. As a result, the eighth goodness of fit of 0.75 in the modeling experiment is selected as the best thermal dynamic response model. The fit level of the model output to the actual room temperature is shown in Fig. 6 . 3.2.2 Energy consumption analysis model construction results The construction method employed in the energy consumption analysis model is the same as that used in the thermal dynamic response model, where the data are randomly selected 10 times for energy consumption analysis model fitting. The model has an average goodness of fit average of approximately 0.94, and thus, fits very well. The average error between the return temperature of the fitted model and the true return temperature is approximately 0.7% and the maximum error does not exceed 10%. The fitting effect diagram of predicting the return water temperature and the actual return water temperature is shown in Fig. 7 . 3.2.3 Predictive model construction results The input and output parameters of the basic prediction model, along with the construction steps are the same as those of the thermal dynamic response model, but only the data of the first week are used to build the basic predictive type. Predictions of room temperature for the next three days are shown in Fig. 8 . The prediction result shows that the goodness of fit with the actual indoor temperature for the next 3 days can total more than 0.75, reaching an ideal level. Therefore, this model can be used as a basic prediction model to further analyze the performance of MPC and AMPC. 3.3 Simulation results of the three control systems 3.3.1 Room temperature control capability and energy consumption analysis The control object is simulated with the three different control systems established above. The data from 168 h in the previous week are used as historical data, and outdoor temperature, water supply flow, and solar radiation data for the previous 1992 h are used as known data inputs. The control effect is evaluated from the room temperature stability, and the energy consumption level is measured by comparing it with the hourly average energy consumption of the original heat exchange station control system. The control effect during the actual operation of the heat exchange station is used as a comparison item, and the performance of each control system is analyzed and compared. In Fig. 9 , the average temperature control deviations of the different control systems are compared. The results of the data analysis show that the average absolute deviation between the indoor temperature achieved by the original heat exchange station control system and the target temperature is 0.4 °C, and the maximum deviation is 1.27 °C. The average absolute deviation from the target temperature of the PID system is 0.2 °C, and the maximum deviation is 0.77 °C; for MPC and AMPC, these values are 0.18 °C, 0.73 °C and 0.13 °C, 0.62 °C, respectively. Under the AMPC strategy, the average indoor temperature fluctuation is smaller than the other two and closer to the target temperature; the control level is ideal. The energy consumption of the heat exchange station heating system is calculated from the flow rate and the temperature difference between the supply and the return water. The average hourly energy consumption obtained from the actual heating system and the simulation results of the PID, MPC and AMPC systems are 1576, 1460, 1347 and 1256 kWh, respectively. As shown in Table 2 , compared to the actual control strategy, PID energy consumption is reduced by 7.3%, MPC energy consumption by 14.5%, and AMPC energy consumption by 20.3%. AMPC saves 6.7% of energy consumption compared to MPC and 14% compared to PID. Among the three control systems, AMPC is found to be the best, in terms of the ability to control the room temperature and the level of energy savings. This is because AMPC not only can predict future environmental change but also can prepare to adapt in advance. Moreover, during the operation, the predictive model can be updated according to the data received at the actual runtime to improve the accuracy of the prediction control. 3.3.2 Comparison of the response speeds of the three control strategies The response speed of the control system to changes in interference factors is an important evaluation indicator. For heating control systems, a timely response can make the system respond efficiently to factors such as weather changes and system failures, thus reducing fluctuations in indoor temperature. A good reaction speed can also avoid overshooting, resulting in unnecessary energy waste. A controller's response speed to a step control signal is usually assessed by how long it takes to reach 90% of a set target. The response speeds of the three simulation systems are compared in Fig. 10 . As shown in the figure, the response times of the PID control, MPC, and AMPC are 30, 29, and 26 h, respectively. The reaction speed of AMPC is slightly faster than that of basic MPC and PID control, and the overall response time of AMPC is relatively long because the building's thermal inertia makes the room temperature change slower. 3.3.3 Comparison of the performance in response to extreme weather To compare the performance of the three control systems against extreme weather, the period of normal weather data in the operating period must be replaced with that of weather data with sudden and significant cooling. The detailed method involves randomly taking continuous 168 h of outdoor temperature data and reducing them by 2\u20136 °C to lower than the average minimum temperature in winter. To simulate the process of sudden and large cooling and recovery, the intermediate time period is cooled down the most to achieve the same law as a sudden drop in the outdoor temperature in real life. The data obtained after the modification of the outdoor temperatures are shown in Fig. 11 . The simulation is performed using the modified room temperature data while other conditions remain unchanged. The results of the indoor temperature control for the three control systems are shown in Fig. 12 . The results of the analysis of specific data show that during extreme weather, the average absolute deviations between the target indoor temperature and simulation results for AMPC, MPC, and PID control systems are 0.18 °C, 0.27 °C, and 0.32 °C, respectively. The AMPC system appears to have a better effect on indoor temperature control than the MPC and PID control systems, and the indoor temperature deviation values are 33% and 44% lower, respectively, than those of the other two systems. Thus, AMPC system is the most robust. 3.4 Discussion At present, due to the difficulty of accurately modeling large-scale building complexes, most of the research on MPC in the field of heating is limited to a single room or building. This study proposed to use the subspace identification modeling method to establish a black-box model that affects the temperature of the heating room, which can promote the application of MPC in the field of heating to residential areas and other complex architectures at a lower cost. In addition, the AMPC central heating control system established by using rolling optimization of the operation data of the previous week in this study overcomes the problem of robustness deficiency that can easily occur in MPC central heating control, greatly enhances its ability to adjust to weather changes, and has better energy savings and comfort improvement. Compared with the original heat exchange station control strategy, the simulated indoor temperature control deviation is reduced by 67.5%, and the energy consumption is decreased by 20.3%, which further verified the feasibility of AMPC, especially the heat exchange station platform applied to central heating. As it is a model for all heating users in the entire community established by the water supply and return data and the meteorological data of the heat exchange station, the average temperature control deviation and heating energy consumption are optimized. However, some users in the most unfavorable heating circuit are prone to hydraulic imbalance. Individual monitoring and regulation of users at the most unfavorable points of the heating circuit may solve this problem. There are still many other aspects of performance that must be compared further, such as peak load transfer capacity, control system calculation time, and robustness to other disturbances and changes in operating conditions. In addition, while using the AMPC control algorithm, rolling optimization based on the internal optimization algorithm, in the future, the genetic algorithm, particle swarm algorithm, firefly algorithm and other advanced optimization algorithms will be combined with AMPC, which may be able to improve the control performance. 4 Conclusion A multi-input nonlinear model combined with subspace identification algorithms is constructed using the heating data from the heat exchange stations and meteorological data. The control performances of three different control strategies (PID, MPC, and AMPC) are evaluated. The main concluding points of this paper are as follows. Heating systems with AMPC strategies have significant advantages in terms of indoor temperature control and energy savings. Compared to the MPC strategy, the control deviation of the indoor temperature is reduced by 27.7%, and the energy consumption is reduced by 6.7%. Compared to the PID control strategy, the control deviation of the room temperature is decreased by 35%, and energy consumption is decreased by 14%. Compared to the original heat exchange station control strategy, the control deviation of the indoor temperature is decreased by 67.5%, and the energy consumption is reduced by 20.3%. The response times of the three control strategies are compared by changing the control signal. The results show that the response speed of AMPC is similar to that of MPC, and that both are slightly faster than the PID control strategy. AMPC is more robust in dealing with severe weather than the other two control strategies. Comparing the performances of the three control systems in terms of dealing with severe weather, the AMPC system reduces the indoor temperature deviation by 44% compared to the PID control system. In summary, the AMPC system has a better control effect on heat control than the traditional PID control and MPC systems, and has broad application prospects in the heating field.

        "dc:description": "Space heating accounts for a large proportion of a building's energy consumption, and improving heating efficiency is a significant approach to reduce heating energy consumption and carbon emissions. To improve heating efficiency and meet the demand for thermal comfort, this paper proposes an adaptive model predictive control (AMPC) based heating control strategy to regulate the heating parameters of heat exchange stations in residential communities. A multi-input non-linear model combined with subspace identification algorithms is constructed using the heating data from the heat exchange stations and meteorological data. An AMPC control system, a model predictive control (MPC) and a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control system, are then built to compare their control performances such as room temperature control accuracy, energy saving capacity, response speed, and robustness under extreme weather. The results show that the AMPC strategy outperforms the other two, with a 67.5% reduction in room temperature control deviation and a 20.3% reduction in energy consumption compared to the actual operation of the heating plant. Under extreme weather conditions, the AMPC strategy has 44% less deviation in indoor temperature control and a shorter response time than the least effective PID control strategy of the three. The AMPC system has broad application prospects in the heating field.",
