Building photovoltaic (PV) power generation is intermittent, volatile, random, and uncontrollable; thus, the use of solar grid-connected power generation can lead to a series of problems, such as grid voltage fluctuations and power imbalance. As a typical flexible load, the scheduling and regulation of the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system load can help a grid-connected solar grid achieve balanced and flexible operation. This study proposes a PV capacity dynamic tracking model predictive control strategy for air-conditioning systems with flexible loads. This strategy aims to effectively address the issue of unstable grid-connected output of solar PV systems. In particular, a solar radiation prediction model based on a long short-term memory neural network optimized by the grey wolf optimization algorithm was established, which effectively improved the model prediction accuracy. The cost function of HVAC flexible load control considers the law of solar PV output and the human thermal comfort model. A genetic algorithm (GA) is used to obtain the optimal control parameters for dynamic regulation. The GA was employed to efficiently and effectively optimize the control of flexible HVAC loads, considering the variability of the solar PV output and ensuring human thermal comfort. A dynamic regulation model was developed for a typical office building with a grid-connected solar PV power generation system. TRNSYS was utilized for verification based on the actual measured data and relevant meteorological parameters of the case building. A new evaluation metric, volatility, was proposed to evaluate net load fluctuation. The simulation platform based on the physical building yield results indicated a strong resemblance between the energy consumption curve under the predicted control conditions using the flexible model and the PV generation curve. Additionally, the net load volatility was measured to be 2.63. Compared with the predicted control condition without the flexible model, the net load volatility of the grid was reduced by 47.08%, and the energy-saving rate reached 10.89% in the summer.

Owing to the highly volatile, intermittent, and stochastic nature of renewable energy sources [1\u20135], the net load curve tends of the grid to exhibit a significant \u201cduck-shaped\u201d pattern as more of these energy sources are connected [6]. In this context, the net load refers to the total load after deducting the output from the renewable energy sources. Simultaneously, buildings worldwide contribute approximately 30\u201340% of total energy consumption [7\u20139]. Therefore, achieving power balance and ensuring grid stability through the integration of a building power system with the grid poses a new challenge. The increasing use of renewable energy in buildings is vital owing to its potential to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, mitigate climate change, and promote sustainable energy solutions [10]. In the future energy-supply regime driven by renewable electricity, buildings will be supplied with energy through a combination of external and renewable electricity sources. However, the grid connection of photovoltaics (PV) from buildings can lead to several problems such as power imbalance and voltage fluctuations. Although storage devices [11] are often used to capture the uncertainty in electricity produced by solar PV, current electrical storage technologies require large capital investments, which is the motivation for pursuing research on other options, such as heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems for buildings. The HVAC system of a building typically accounts for >40% of the total energy demand [12]. Owing to the significant proportion of electricity consumed by the HVAC system, it serves as a flexible building load with a wide range of load-regulation capabilities, offering numerous possibilities for demand response. On a daily timescale, there was a strong correlation between solar power generation and building cooling demands. However, on an hourly scale, the air-conditioning load remains relatively constant and does not closely follow the fluctuations in PV generation [13]. Specific measures can be implemented on either the air conditioning load side or the PV production side to address the disparity between PV power generation and HVAC system energy consumption [14]. These measures aim to correlate the energy consumption of the HVAC system with the PV power generation in the short term, enabling the cooling and heating loads to follow the power source. By achieving this synchronization, the stability of grid operation can be ensured. Numerous researchers have dedicated their studies to the scheduling and regulation of flexible loads in HVAC systems to reduce peak loads and enhance grid stability. The control of system load in HVAC systems involves numerous control parameters, and past research on regulating HVAC load has applied various means, such as room set temperature adjustment, chilled water flow rate control, chilled water supply temperature management, air supply volume modulation, and unit start-stop control. These efforts effectively regulate the electric load within an HVAC system. Hao et al. proposed a feedforward control system based on changing the fan speed of an air-conditioning system [15]. For the grid connection of integrated renewable energy systems in buildings, Dong et al. developed a mixed-integer quadratic optimization model to optimally schedule the on and off of air-conditioning units to achieve the effect of consuming most of the power generated by a local PV system [16]. Multiple studies have substantiated the feasibility of initiating flexible load deployment in HVAC systems by modifying their operating parameters [17,18]. However, current research indicates a gap in the fine-tuning of HVAC systems within the context of flexible load dispatching for integrated energy systems that incorporate emerging renewable energy sources such as PV power generation. In particular, the energy consumption of HVAC systems should be synchronized with PV power generation to ensure timely utilization of green power, ultimately reducing fluctuations in power grid operations. In conclusion, it is crucial to develop a dynamic control strategy for PV tracking, incorporate flexible load management, and optimize HVAC system operational parameters while considering the inherent uncertainties associated with renewable energy sources. In terms of control modeling, model predictive control (MPC) utilizes a dynamic model of the system as its foundation [19\u201330], allowing for the accurate prediction of future system behavior and making control decisions based on these predictions [31]. By establishing precise system models, MPC utilizes advanced optimization algorithms to solve optimal control strategies, enabling the precise control of the system [32,33]. Moreover, MPC incorporates real-time adjustments at each control time step to accommodate system variations and make optimal decisions promptly [34\u201337]. This approach effectively enhances the system response speed and stability. In addition, the MPC strategy has been fully applied to power and HVAC systems and has achieved satisfactory control results. For the power sector, Pandey et al. employed an MPC scheme to generate a hydro-turbine valve signal to dispatch the necessary hydropower to the intermittent grid and maintain the grid frequency [38]. Jin et al. proposed a phased dynamic economic dispatch framework to optimize the dispatch of distributed energy sources (PV and wind power) and smart buildings [39]. It was demonstrated that the MPC-strategy-based dispatching approach smoothened the power curve more optimally. Diaz-Londono et al. employed an economic MPC strategy that considered the uncertainty in the arrival time and state of electric vehicles. This strategy aims to minimize the operating costs of electric vehicle charging stations, thereby maximizing the grid balance maintenance [40]. Wang et al. conducted a comprehensive analysis of inverter air-conditioning systems using an MPC strategy during the summer [41]. Their study considered both the system energy cost and human thermal comfort to alleviate the operational burden on smart grids caused by a power supply-demand imbalance. Zhao et al. proposed an MPC strategy based on a regional energy system model that considers load forecasting and time-delay characteristics. This model improves the temporal alignment between energy supply and demand, thereby reducing energy peaks and overall energy consumption in regional energy systems [42]. Lv et al. proposed an adaptive MPC control model for a hybrid air-conditioning system that combines radiant floor heating and all-air heating. The design objective of this model is to maintain indoor thermal comfort with minimum system energy consumption and optimize the determination of the system operating mode [21]. Péan reported that the objective functions of the MPC in integrated energy scheduling primarily include minimizing economic costs, minimizing the use of nonrenewable energy sources, and minimizing carbon dioxide emissions [43]. However, a notable gap exists in research on MPC strategies for flexible loads in HVAC systems. Particularly, there is a lack of studies focusing on refined MPC strategies that effectively incorporate uncertainties and uncontrollable variations in renewable energy sources as optimization parameters specifically tailored for HVAC systems. Moreover, in existing research on MPC strategies, the cost function is primarily centered on cost, indoor thermal comfort, and carbon emissions. However, adjusting electricity consumption based on the energy production of renewable sources is rarely incorporated into the cost function of MPC strategies. Consequently, the establishment of MPC regulation strategies based on flexible load allocation at the HVAC system level to track renewable energy production can fill this research gap. A key component of MPC is the prediction model. To achieve accurate tracking of the PV capacity using an HVAC system, an accurate prediction of the PV output capacity is required [44]. With the development of deep-learning, long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks have gained extensive attention for the prediction of PV power generation owing to their advantages in modeling time series [45,46]. To further improve the accuracy and stability of the prediction method, Zhou et al. used the sine-cosine algorithm to determine the LSTM parameters [44]. Lin G-Q et al. used the moth-flame optimization (MFO) algorithm to optimize the support vector machine (SVM) parameters [47]. Abdel-Nasser et al. proposed the use of a long short-term memory recurrent neural network (LSTM-RNN) to accurately forecast the output power of PV systems [48]. Wang et al. proposed a hybrid deep-learning model and applied it to PV power prediction; the results showed that the hybrid prediction model had a better prediction effect than a single prediction model [49]. Coupled models for hybrid optimization were incorporated and optimization algorithms were employed to optimize the relevant parameters in the prediction algorithm; the prediction accuracy could be significantly improved. An optimal control strategy for an HVAC system that can effectively capture and utilize the PV generation curve should be developed. Fine-tuning control research for HVAC systems faces a limitation when it comes to optimizing operating parameters for uncertain and uncontrollable changes in solar power generation. With respect to the cost function in the MPC strategy in the reviews, the target of rolling optimization is to minimize the energy consumption cost without considering the volatility of the power grid caused by the current large-scale use of solar power. To address this limitation, this paper presents a PV capacity dynamic tracking model predictive control (T-MPC) strategy for air conditioning systems with flexible loads. The proposed strategy utilized the flexible load characteristics of buildings to develop intelligent HVAC MPC strategies. Tracking fluctuations in PV power generation enables dynamic optimization control of the thermal environment in buildings. This approach is important for enhancing power grid reliability. The innovative points of this study are as follows: (1) A PV dynamic T-MPC strategy was established for an HVAC system. This contribution addresses certain gaps in research on the supply side of PV power generation and the demand side of air-conditioning systems. The control model was developed by incorporating a building cooling capacity prediction model, PV power generation curve, and human thermal comfort model. The PV power generation curve was tracked while considering the penalty associated with the room temperature to form the cost function. (2) A solar radiation prediction model was established using a long short-term memory neural network optimized by grey wolf optimization (GWO-LSTM). The GWO algorithm was employed to optimize the setting parameters of the LSTM neural network, specifically the number of neurons in the hidden layer and the learning rate. This optimization approach enhanced the accuracy of solar radiation prediction and enabled the development of an accurate PV power prediction model. In addition, the computation time of the GWO-LSTM neural network was reduced from 20\u201330 min to 2\u20135 min, which significantly reduced the computation cost and improved the computation efficiency. (3) This study introduces a novel evaluation metric called volatility to assess net load fluctuation. The evaluation demonstrates that the proposed MPC strategy effectively utilizes green power, reduces net load volatility, and ensures the smooth operation of the grid. 2 Methodology The technical procedure used in this study is shown in Fig. 1 . The prediction models employed in this study include a solar radiation prediction model using a GWO-LSTM neural network, a PV prediction model using an artificial neural network (ANN), a building cooling load prediction model using a generalized regression neural network (GRNN), and an indoor temperature prediction model derived from a linear transformation of the cooling load prediction model. The T-MPC strategy aims to obtain the PV power generation curve, combined with timely feedback on indoor temperature and dynamic optimization of operation parameters, to achieve the goal of consistent change trends of the demand-side air conditioning load consumption curve and PV power generation curve while ensuring indoor comfort. 2.1 T-MPC control strategy The details of the MPC strategy implementation are as follows: MPC design mainly includes a prediction model and an optimization algorithm [50,51]. The T-MPC strategy optimizes the cost function to minimize the discrepancy between the slopes of the HVAC system power consumption curve and the PV prediction curve. Simultaneously, it ensures a penalty value for room temperature regulation. This optimization process allowed for the effective synchronization of power consumption and PV generation while maintaining the desired room temperature levels. 2.1.1 Cost function Random and intermittent inputs of PV power generation can affect the grid. Ensuring that the demand-side electricity consumption curve and PV power generation curve change with the same trend significantly contributes to maintaining stable power output from the grid. In this study, the PV power generation was insufficient to satisfy the building power consumption, resulting in non-overlapping curves for the two variables. The PV power-generation curve was used as the reference trajectory to align the trends of the HVAC system power-consumption curve as closely as possible. The power consumption curves are shown in Fig. 2 . This was achieved by ensuring that the straight lines formed by PV power generation at the current moment E k + i − 1 and PV power generation at the forecast moment E k + i were as close as possible to the trend of the straight line formed by HVAC power consumption at the current moment P k + i − 1 and HVAC power consumption at the future moment P k + i . The control objectives of the study were to ensure that the system power usage aligns with PV generation and to achieve acceptable indoor temperature control. The cost function considers two factors: The first factor aims to minimize the difference between the trend of the straight line formed by the current and forecasted PV power generation and the trend of the straight line formed by the current and future HVAC system electricity consumption. The second factor accounts for the penalty associated with the indoor temperature. The form of the cost function is given by Eq. (1). The weighting coefficients λ and γ are set according to the actual situation. The original format of this cost function [19] is provided in [26]. (1) J t = ∑ i = 1 N λ P k + i − P k + i − 1 E k + i − E k + i − 1 − 1 2 + ∑ i = 1 N γ T set , i − T 2 where N represents the prediction horizon; λ 、 γ is the weighting factor ( λ + γ = 1 ), in this paper, taking λ = 0.9 and γ = 0.1 because this study pays more attention to the approximate trend between the electricity consumption of HVAC system and the power generation curve of PV system； P k + i is the electricity consumption of the HVAC system at the future time, kW·h； P k + i − 1 is the electricity consumption of the HVAC system at the current time, kW·h； E k + i is the electricity generation of the PV system at the predicted time, kW·h； E k + i − 1 is the electricity generation of the PV system at the current time, kW·h； T set , i represents the room temperature setting value at the i moment, °C; T represents the optimal set temperature in the room, °C. To understand the physical quantities in the cost function better, the relevant parameters were expanded, as illustrated in Eq. (2). (2) cM Δ T / 3.6 = Q Δ T = T i − T o P g = Q COP P = P g + P e , pump + P c , pump where Δ T 、 T i 、 T o are the temperature difference, return water temperature, and supply water temperature, respectively, °C; c is the specific heat capacity of water, kJ / kg · ° C ; M is the water flow rate, m3/h; Q is the cooling load, kW； P 、 P g 、 P e , pump 、 P c , pump are the total HVAC system energy consumption, ground source heat pump unit energy consumption, chilled-side pump energy consumption, and cooling-side pump energy consumption, respectively, kW·h. 2.1.2 T-MPC strategy design The flow of the MPC constructed in this study is shown in Fig. 3 . The cooling prediction model, which uses the optimization variable T set as the input, predicts the output cooling prediction values. Rolling optimization uses a genetic algorithm (GA) [52] to perform iterative global online optimization of the cost function J t . The rolling optimization process involves minimizing the difference between the slopes of the HVAC power consumption curve and the PV generation curve. In addition, the penalty associated with room-temperature optimization was considered. This allows us to obtain optimal control variables within a finite time horizon. The first optimal control sequence at u is used as the output parameter for the control. The optimized chilled-water supply temperature T eo , chilled-water flow rate M e and cooling-water return temperature T ci were applied to a controlled system. The system then outputs the final actual cooling capacity, which is compared with the value predicted by the prediction model. This feedback comparison allowed us to achieve a feedback correction. 2.2 Prediction models 2.2.1 Input parameters section method Although various factors influence the prediction values, it is not necessarily better to include more input parameters in the prediction models. Too many parameters can complicate the network structure of the model and result in a longer training time. Therefore, the input parameters should be selected rationally before building a neural network model. In this study, Pearson bivariate correlation analysis was used to screen the input parameters. The Pearson correlation coefficient, introduced by Karl Pearson in 1895 [53], is extensively utilized to quantify the degree of correlation between two variables and is typically denoted as \u201cr.\u201d Pearson's correlation coefficient between variables X and Y is given by Eq. (3) [42]. (3) r = ∑ i = 1 n X i − X ¯ Y i − Y ¯ ∑ i = 1 n X i − X ¯ 2 ∑ i = 1 n Y i − Y ¯ 2 where n is the total number of samples, X ¯ and Y ¯ are the sample means, i refers to the i sample. The larger the absolute value of the correlation coefficient r, the stronger the correlation. Pearson's correlation analysis was conducted using SPSS software. In addition to determining the correlation by the size of the correlation coefficient, a significance test was also performed. A smaller sign indicates a higher correlation between the two variables, <0.05 is a significant correlation, and <0.001 indicates a highly significant correlation. 2.2.2 Solar radiation prediction model coupling of GWO and LSTM The GWO algorithm [54] has the advantages of fast convergence, simple structure, few adjustment parameters, and strong global search ability; therefore, it was utilized to optimize the hyperparameters of the LSTM neural network. Deep-learning algorithms have the advantages of strong learning ability and good adaptability; therefore, LSTM was used to build the solar radiation prediction model owing to its advantage in modeling time series. The LSTM cell consists of a forget gate, an input gate, an output gate, and a cell state [55]. The optimal solution in the population is α , the sub-optimal solution is β , the third optimal solution is δ , and all other solutions are called ω . The behavioral model of the grey wolf encircling its prey is represented by Eq. (4) and Eq. (5). (4) D → = C → · X → p t − X → t (5) X → t + 1 = X → p t − A → · D → where D → is the distance between the grey wolf and prey, t is the number of current iterations, X → p is the position vector of the prey, X → is the position vector of the grey wolf, A → is the coefficient vector, and C → is the random vector, which is calculated using Eq. (6) and Eq. (7). (6) A → = 2 a → · r → 1 − a → (7) C → = 2 · r → 2 where r → 1 and r → 2 are random vectors of [0,1], a → is the convergence factor. The parameters in the LSTM prediction models [56] were the number of neurons in the hidden layer, maximum number of network iterations, gradient threshold, and learning rate. The number of neurons affects the fitting ability of the algorithm: too few neurons lead to underfitting, whereas too many neurons lead to overfitting. The setting of parameters is very important, and these parameters are often selected by trial and error while combining experience, resulting in the inaccuracy of the LSTM prediction model [57]. Therefore, the GWO algorithm was used to optimize some parameters of the LSTM neural network to improve the accuracy of the prediction model. A flowchart of the building of the prediction model based on the optimization of the LSTM neural network using the GWO algorithm is shown in Fig. 4 . The specific implementation process is as follows: Step 1: Data preprocessing (including abnormal data rejection and data normalization) of the dataset and division of the training and test sets. Step 2: Initialize the LSTM neural network-related parameters such as the number of input layers, number of output layers, maximum number of iterations, and gradient threshold. Step 3: Apply the training set pair to carry out the GWO algorithm procedure and output the optimal solution α wolf location as hyperparameters (the number of hidden layer neurons and learning rate in the optimized LSTM neural network) into the GWO-LSTM prediction model. Step 4: Use the test set for validation, output the results, and calculate the relevant evaluation metrics. 2.2.3 PV power prediction model based on back propagation neural network Back propagation (BP) neural networks [58] have strong nonlinear mapping, self-learning, self-adaptive, generalization, and fault tolerance capabilities [59,60]. The BP neural network consists of an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer, as shown in Fig. 5 . The numbers of input and output layers are determined by the numbers of input and output parameters, respectively. The number of neurons in the hidden layer p is determined using Eq. (8), and the number of neurons in the hidden layer with the minimum error was determined using a trial-and-error method. (8) p = m + n + c where p is the number of neurons in the hidden layer, m is the number of nodes in the input layer, n is the number of nodes in the output layer, c is generally a constant in the range of 1\u201310. 2.2.4 Cooling load prediction model based on GRNN GRNN [61] has excellent nonlinear mapping ability and learning speed, as well as high fault tolerance and robustness with high accuracy for both large and small numbers of samples; therefore, GRNN is used as the building cooling load prediction model. The cooling load forecasting process is illustrated in Fig. 6 . The architecture of the GRNN consists mainly of four layers: the input, pattern, summation, and output layers, as shown in Fig. 7 . The input layer is the input parameter determined using the sensitivity analysis method, and the output layer is the predicted load. The ith mode layer neuron transfer function based on the Gaussian function can be expressed as Eq. (9). (9) P i = exp − X − X i T X − X i 2 σ 2 , i = 1 2 ⋯ n where σ is the smoothing factor or diffusion coefficient, X is the input variable, X i is the sample corresponding to the first neuron. There are two types of neurons in the summation layer, one of which is the arithmetic sum of the outputs of the neurons in the pattern layer, with a connection weight of 1 between the pattern layer and each neuron, and the transfer function is shown in Eq. (10); the other is the weighted sum of the neurons in the pattern layer, with y ij denoting the j th element in the i th output sample Y i , that is, the connection weight between the i th neuron in the pattern layer and the j th neuron in the summation layer. The transfer function is given by Eq. (11). (10) S D = ∑ i = 1 n P i (11) S Nj = ∑ i = 1 n y ij P i , j = 1 2 ⋯ n The number of neurons in the output layer is the dimension k of the output vector in the sample. Each neuron sums the two summation outputs of the summation layer, with neuron j corresponding to the j th element in sample Y i , calculated using Eq. (12). (12) Y j = S Nj S D 2.3 Evaluation indicators The evaluation indexes used in the study are listed below. The T-MPC strategy uses a grid volatility evaluation index to quantitatively assess the volatility of the net load, which refers to the power withdrawn from or transmitted to the grid. Volatility is used to evaluate power fluctuations in the grid; the higher the volatility, the greater the instability brought to the grid by power withdrawal or transmission. This was calculated using Eq. (13). (13) s = ∑ x − x ¯ 2 n − 1 where x is the net load at each moment in the sample, x ¯ is the average net load at each moment in the sample, n is the number of samples. The relevant evaluation metrics for prediction model accuracy [62] are as follows: (1) R-Square (R2), which measures the fitness of the model to the measured values, is shown in Eq. (14). (14) R 2 = 1 − ∑ i = 1 N x i sim − x i mea 2 ∑ i = 1 N x i mea − x ave mea 2 (2) The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), which reflects the average relative error between the predicted and measured values, reflects the accuracy of the model, as shown in Eq. (15). (15) MAPE = 1 N ∑ i = 1 N x i sim − x i mea x i mea × 100 % (3) The root means square error (RMSE), which reflects the degree of dispersion of the data, is more sensitive to outliers and reflects the stability of the model, as shown in Eq. (16). (16) RMSE = ∑ i = 1 N x i sim − x i mea 2 N (4) The correlation coefficient (R), as shown in Eq. (17). (17) R = ∑ i = 1 N x i sim − x ave sim x i mea − x ave mea ∑ i = 1 N x i sim − x ave sim 2 ∑ i = 1 N x i mea − x ave mea 2 (5) The relative RMSE (rRMSE), as shown in Eq. (18). (18) rRMSE = 1 N ∑ i = 1 N x i sim − x i mea 2 x ave mea where N is the number of samples, x i sim is the predicted value of the i sample, x i mea the measured value of the i sample, x ave mea is the mean value of the measured sample, and x ave sim the mean value of the predicted sample. 3 Case study 3.1 Case description The study was conducted in an office building in Tianjin, China. The building consists of five floors above ground and one basement floor. The five aboveground floors are primarily designated as offices and public areas, whereas the basement floor serves as a parking lot and equipment room. The overall dimensions of the building are 65.2 m × 58 m × 23.7 m, totaling 18,088.09 m2. The air-conditioning system covered a cooling area of 13,192.73 m2. PV power generation equipment was installed on the roof to provide renewable energy for electricity supply to the building. The external walls of the building were constructed using autoclaved aerated concrete blocks and equipped with external insulation. The windows were double-glazed with an air gap and internal shading devices were used for sun protection. Because of the nature of the building as an office space, human occupancy within each room was relatively stable, with a fixed value determined through on-site surveys. The total number of permanent occupants of the building was approximately 300. The building operates on weekdays from 9:00 to 17:00. The cooling season of the building is from June to September. The 3D DesignBuilder building model is shown in Fig. 8 . The heat transfer coefficients of the various building envelope components are listed in Table 1 , and the window-to-wall ratios for different orientations are listed in Table 2 . The indoor temperature, humidity, ventilation rate, occupancy density, lighting, and equipment density of the buildings are listed in Table 3 . The power consumption of the internal office equipment in each room was determined based on the number of working personnel, with each occupant equipped with a set of office devices, including a host computer and monitor. The heat dissipation rates of each device are listed in Table 4 . This study collected and calculated the monthly cooling load data for the case study buildings from June to September 2020 and June to August 2021. Fig. 9 shows a comparison between the simulated and actual values of the cooling load during the summer months. The calculation results in a MAPE of 2.10% and an rRMSE of 3.61%. Both values fell within the error tolerance range specified in the ASHRAE standard [63], indicating that the DesignBuilder building model developed in this study is acceptable and can be utilized for further research. The PV power generation system of this building is primarily a grid-connected solar PV power generation system composed of solar cell arrays, controllers, and inverters. The PV array converts solar energy into direct current (DC) electrical energy, which is fed directly into the alternating current (AC) load or grid of the building via a grid-connected inverter. The installed capacity of the PV power generation system of the building was 42 kWp, using 140 pieces of 300 Wp monocrystalline silicon modules with a module size of 1640 mm × 991 mm × 40 mm and fixed installation with a 35° tilt angle. The HVAC system was a ground-source heat pump with a radiant floor end. The air-conditioning system was mainly composed of two ground-source heat pump units, three air-conditioning side pumps, two ground-source side pumps, and a radiant end. In daily operation, both the ground source heat pump unit A and its associated ground-source side pumps were kept in standby mode. Unit A is activated only when ground source heat pump unit B either fails or cannot provide sufficient cooling capacity. This ensures that unit A serves as a backup system and is ready to be utilized whenever unit B is unable to adequately perform its cooling functions. The operational flow of the HVAC system equipment with PV modules is shown in Fig. 10 . The detailed parameters of the HVAC system are listed in Table 5 . 3.2 TRNSYS simulation platform construction 3.2.1 Equipment mathematical model In this study, a multivariate polynomial model was employed to construct a mathematical model of a ground-source heat pump unit. The \u201cequipment mathematical model database\u201d is utilized for parameter identification, which includes variables such as chilled water return temperature, cooling water return temperature, chilled water flow rate, unit hourly energy consumption, real-time cooling capacity, and the coefficient of performance (COP) value obtained through data pre-processing techniques. The multivariate polynomial regression model (MPRM) [64] is proposed by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in the USA and is calculated according to Eq. (19). (19) COP = b 1 + b 2 · Q e + b 3 · T ei + b 4 · T ci + b 5 · Q e 2 + b 6 · T ei 2 + b 7 · T ci 2 + b 8 · Q e · T ei + b 9 · Q e · T ci + b 10 · T ci · T ei where b 1 ∼ b 9 is the parameter to be identified; Q e is the cooling load, kW; T ci is the cooling water return temperature, °C; T ei is the chilled water return temperature, °C. Owing to the large number of parameters involved in the multivariate polynomial model, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm [65] is employed to determine the parameters to be identified within the model. Owing to the shorter duration of simultaneous operations, the databases of unit A and B operations contain a varying number of samples. Finally, ground source heat pump unit A was trained using 140 sets of operation data from the summer of 2020, and 70 sets of data from the summer of 2021 were used for validation. In contrast, ground source heat pump unit B was trained using 200 sets of data from the summer of 2020, with 50 sets of data from the summer of 2021 used for validation. The final outputs of each parameter of the mathematical models of ground-source heat pump units A and B are listed in Table 6 . Three types of pumps were used in this study. A mathematical model for the energy consumption of these pumps was derived by combining data preprocessing from the building automation system (BAS) platform with the operating performance curves provided by the manufacturers. Two hundred sets of operating data, including pump flow, head, and power, were collected for each pump type. Through linear regression analysis, the mathematical model of each pump was obtained as follows: (1) Unit AB air conditioning side pump 1 and Unit A ground source side pump. (20) P pump 1 = 3.423 + 0.07764 × M e − 0.00006 × M e 2 (2) AB unit air conditioning side water pump 2. (21) P pump 2 = 5.888 + 0.0875 × M e − 0.0003 × M e 2 (3) Unit B ground source side water pump. (22) P pump 3 = 12.927 + 0.03086 × M e − 0.00001 × M e 2 where P pump is the pump power (kW) and M e is the chilled water flow rate, m3/h. Fig. 11 illustrates the comparison between the measured and predicted energy efficiencies of ground source heat pump units A and B. As shown in the figure, the relative error between the predicted and measured values remained consistently within 10%. Thus, the established mathematical model for the energy efficiency of the ground-source heat pump units is reasonable. By employing Eqs. (14)\u2013(16) for error calculations in the mathematical model, the error evaluation of the mathematical model of the equipment is presented in Table 7 . The accuracy and validity of the established mathematical model for the energy efficiency of the unit were successfully demonstrated. 3.2.2 Verification of simulation platform This study utilized TRNSYS 16 to construct a primary simulation platform, employing custom-built modules developed in C language to create geothermal heat pump units and circulation pumps that accurately reflect real-world conditions. The components used in the system simulations are listed in Table 8 . The constructed TRNSYS is shown in Fig. 12 . The TRNSYS simulation platform serves as a foundation for future research on optimizing and controlling system operations. To ensure the accuracy of the simulation results, it was necessary to validate the constructed TRNSYS model. This study verified a self-built module for the ground source heat pump, a self-built module for water pumps, and the overall system. By setting the parameters of the self-built module, Type401 is established for the ground source heat pump. Actual operational data are inputted by Type9e, and energy consumption is outputted through Type25f, as shown in Fig. 13 . After performing the calculations, the MAPE was determined to be 4.60%. Accordingly, the established self-built module for a ground-source heat pump is accurate and can be used for further research. Upon completion of the self-built module for the circulation pump, an accuracy validation platform was constructed, and the validation models for the chiller pump and cooling water pump are presented in Fig. 14 . A comparison was made between the energy consumption output of the self-built modules and that obtained from the mathematical models. Through calculations, the MAPE for the chiller pump was found to be 0.71%, whereas that for the cooling-water pump was 0.20%. These results indicate a high level of accuracy for both models. In this study, 80 sets were selected for comparison with the energy consumption calculated using the simulation platform and the measured energy consumption. The energy consumption of the system includes the energy consumption of the heat pump unit, chilled water pump, and cooling water pump. A comparison is shown in Fig. 15 . The MAPE value for the energy consumption of the entire system is 2.8%. These results demonstrate the accuracy of the device module selection and parameter input in the established TRNSYS model. 3.2.3 T-MPC strategy of air conditioning system The flexible HVAC load can stem from the room-temperature setpoint, which can be dynamically adjusted. Fluctuating room temperature values can potentially affect human thermal comfort. In this paper, the predicted mean vote (PMV) and predicted percent dissatisfied (PPD) indicators [66] are employed to determine the optimal room temperature set point of 25 °C and the temperature range for human thermal comfort, which spans from 23 °C to 28 °C, inclusive of the critical value. The cost function of the optimal control strategy is expressed by Eq. (23). (23) J t = ∑ i = 1 N λ P k + i − P k + i − 1 E k + i − E k + i − 1 − 1 2 + ∑ i = 1 N γ T set , i − 25 2 Considering the feasibility of the actual operation of the system and the simulation, the range of variation in the operational parameters of the system was constrained, as outlined in Table 9 . Finally, the rolling optimization problem can be represented by Eq. (24). u op t = argminJ t (24) s . t . T i = f T i − 1 u t u t − 1 T n , min ≤ T n ≤ T n , max u min ≤ u ≤ u max T co , min ≤ T co ≤ T co , max Δ T e , min ≤ Δ T e ≤ Δ T e , max C M e Δ T e / 3.6 = Q e Δ T e = T ei − T eo P k + i − P k + i − 1 × E k + i − E k + i − 1 > 0 where u is the control variable, this refers to T eo , T ci and M e , T n is the room temperature, °C; T co is the cooling water supply temperature, °C; M e is the chilled water flow rate, m3/h; T eo and T ei are the chilled water supply and return temperatures, °C; Q e is the cooling load, kW; c is the specific heat capacity of water, kJ/(kg·°C). Fig. 16 illustrates the TRNSYS combined with the MATLAB simulation model developed in this study. The operating hours for the summer unit in the case study building ranged from 7:00 to 17:00. To ensure maximum simulation accuracy, the model simulation step was set to 5 min, the control time domain was set to 1 h, and the prediction time domain was 8 h. The optimal control variables obtained using MATLAB were the chilled water supply temperature T eo , chilled water flow rate M e and cooling water return temperature T ci . These values were then read by TRNSYS, which adjusted the operating parameters of the heat pump unit and circulation pump within the system. 3.2.4 Comparative conditions: Control model without accounting for flexible load In this study, rule-based control without accounting for flexible loads and an MPC model without accounting for flexible loads were selected for a comparative analysis. The rule-based control strategy for the unaccounted flexible load was determined based on operating time. A switching signal is then fed into the ground source heat pump and circulating water pump. A rule-based control strategy that does not consider a flexible load (referred to as the baseline variable flow condition) represents the conventional system control method. The main objective is to maintain fixed values for the chilled water supply and return temperature, as well as for the cooling water supply and return temperature. The flow rates of the chilling and cooling water systems were adjusted according to the cooling capacity required by the building. During the implementation of this strategy, there were no additional regulations or feedback regarding the operating parameters and room temperature. The MPC strategy does not account for flexible loads (hereafter referred to as the nonflexible MPC case), which track the set value of the room temperature while ensuring the energy efficiency of the system. For comparison purposes, the cost functions described in Eq. (25) are used. (25) J t = ∑ i = 1 N λ T t − T set t + 1 2 + ∑ i = 1 N γ P total In the cost function, the left term represents the tracking error of the room temperature with respect to the desired set room temperature. In this paper, the room temperature control target is set to 25 °C, and a larger value of the tracking error indicates a worse room temperature control effect. In contrast, P total represents the total operating power of the system, and a smaller value indicates a better energy-saving effect. λ and γ are weight coefficients, and in this case, a value of 0.5 is assigned to both λ and γ . 4 Results 4.1 Prediction models 4.1.1 Input parameters In this study, a Pearson bivariate correlation analysis was used to screen the input parameters. Eq. (3) was used to calculate the correlation between the input parameters. Correlation analysis was conducted using SPSS software. 4.1.1.1 Solar radiation prediction model The input parameters for the solar radiation prediction model were chosen by conducting a sensitivity analysis of the factors influencing the amount of solar radiation. These include the current horizontal total solar radiation value G t , solar azimuth A t , ambient relative humidity RH t , outdoor dry-bulb temperature at the predicted moment T w t + i , outdoor relative humidity RH t + i , and solar azimuth A t + i . The output parameter was the horizontal total solar radiation value at the predicted moment, G t + i . Table 10 presents the results of this analysis. 4.1.1.2 PV power prediction model The results of the correlation analysis of the PV generation prediction model are presented in Table 11 . Based on the absolute value of the correlation coefficient for each parameter, the input parameters used for the PV power generation prediction model were as follows: PV power generation at the current moment E t , total horizontal solar radiation G t , relative humidity RH t , total horizontal solar radiation G t + i , and relative humidity RH t + i at the predicted moment. The output parameter is the amount of PV generated at the time of prediction E t + i . 4.1.1.3 Cooling load prediction model A correlation analysis of the input parameters for the cooling load prediction model is presented in Table 12 . Finally, the cooling load Q t at the current moment, indoor dry-bulb temperature T n t , outdoor dry-bulb temperature T w t + 1 at the predicted time, total solar radiation E t + 1 at the predicted time, outdoor relative humidity RH t + 1 at the predicted time, and room temperature setpoint T n t + 1 at the predicted time were selected as the input parameters of the prediction model, and Q t + 1 was selected as the output parameter. 4.1.2 Accuracy verification 4.1.2.1 Solar radiation prediction model A total of 1615 sets of time-by-time meteorological data, spanning May 1 to August 31, 2021, were chosen for model construction and validation. Of the 1615 sets of meteorological data, 1292 sets were utilized as the training dataset, while the remaining 323 sets were designated as the test dataset, following an 8:2 ratio. In the GWO-LSTM model, the number of wolves in the GWO algorithm is set to six. The optimization parameters focused on in this model were the number of hidden layer neurons and the learning rate within the LSTM neural network. The upper limit of the two parameters was set at ub = 150,0.5 and the lower limit at lb = 80 1 0 − 10 . The configuration parameters for both the GWO-LSTM neural network and the comparative LSTM neural network are listed in Table 13 . Using Eq. (15), Eq. (17) and Eq. (18) to evaluate the model prediction error. The error evaluation indexes of the two models are listed in Table 14 . Fig. 17 shows a comparison between the two models and the actual values. Table 14 indicates that the GWO-LSTM model exhibits a 6.34% improvement in MAPE and a 4.38% enhancement in rRMSE compared with the comparative LSTM model. This signifies that the GWO-LSTM model offers a higher prediction accuracy and demonstrates stronger forecasting performance. As observed in Fig. 17, the GWO-LSTM model provided a better fit to the true values than the LSTM model, particularly for peak-to-valley fluctuations. 4.1.2.2 PV power prediction model The number of hidden layers was typically set to 1. According to the empirical Eq. (8), the BP model uses five input parameters and one output parameter. The hidden layer of the model comprises 17 neurons. A comparison between the predicted and measured values of the BP neural network PV power generation prediction model is shown in Fig. 18 . In general, a correlation coefficient of 0.85 or higher indicates a high level of accuracy. Additionally, to thoroughly assess the accuracy of the model, the R2 value was calculated as 0.9627, indicating that the model had a high level of prediction accuracy. 4.1.2.3 Cooling load prediction model The sample used for the GRNN cooling load prediction model consisted of 2662 sets of data obtained from the DesignBuilder physical model cooling load database. These data covered 22 working days, specifically from July 1 to July 31, 2021, between 7:00 and 17:00. Of the total dataset, 1863 sets of data were used for training the model, whereas the remaining 799 sets of data were reserved for testing the prediction performance of the established model. A comparison of the actual and simulated values of the established model test set is shown in Fig. 19 . The model prediction errors were evaluated using Eq. (15) and Eq. (18). The error evaluation metrics are listed in Table 15 . The MAPE of the test set and the rRMSE met the ASHRAE criteria [63]. Therefore, the established short-term prediction model for the cooling load was accurate. Because the subsequent study focuses on the changes in indoor temperature, a relationship equation between the predicted room temperature, current room temperature, and cooling load was obtained through linear regression. This simplifies the algorithm design and reduces optimization time. The obtained relationship equation is shown in Eq. (26). (26) T n t + 1 = 0.244 + 0.993 × T n t − 0.003 × Q t + 1 + 0.003 × Q t The predicted room temperature values are compared with the actual room temperature values in Fig. 20 . The predicted values of the indoor temperature closely match the actual measured values. This indicated a strong fitting effect and further confirmed the accuracy of the obtained linear relationship. 4.2 Comparison of the control effect of three control strategies Because this study aims to investigate the HVAC system regulation strategy under fluctuating PV power generation, July 6, 2020, a typical day with high fluctuations in PV power generation, was chosen as the starting point for studying the HVAC system regulation strategy based on a flexible load. The prediction and control regulation models were set to be the same, except for the cost function. In particular, the simulation step was set to 5 min, the prediction time domain was 8 h, and the control time domain was 1 h. A comparison of the three operating conditions is presented in Table 16 . 4.2.1 Flexibility effect The net load of the grid refers to the total load remaining after subtracting the output of renewable energy sources. Fig. 21 illustrates the power drawn from the grid by the HVAC system, which is also known as the net load. It compares the net load for three different cases: flexible MPC, nonflexible MPC, and the baseline variable flow case. As depicted in the figure, the net load under the nonflexible MPC condition exhibited significant fluctuations compared to the net load under the flexible MPC condition. Furthermore, the net load of the nonflexible MPC condition displays the typical \u201cduck-shaped\u201d characteristics. The volatility was calculated for the three operating conditions using Eq. (13), as listed in Table 17 . The figure shows that the volatility for the flexible MPC condition was 47.08% lower than that of the nonflexible MPC condition. The results indicate that the flexible MPC control strategy can effectively track PV power generation by implementing precise control of the HVAC system. This strategy enables the timely utilization of green power, reduces the impact of power fluctuations on the grid, and ensures the stable operation of the grid. 4.2.2 Energy saving effect Fig. 22 illustrates the recorded values of the total system energy consumption at each time interval for the three operating conditions, as well as the hourly power production of the PV. The flexible MPC consumed 10.89% less energy than the nonflexible MPC. The figure indicates that the total system energy consumption under the nonflexible MPC and baseline variable flow conditions did not fluctuate significantly. By contrast, the total system energy consumption under the flexible MPC condition demonstrated relatively more fluctuations. This is because the hourly system energy consumption in the flexible MPC case was optimized by adjusting the MPC to obtain the optimal value closest to the variation in PV generation. Fig. 23 provides a more visual representation of the power variation curves for the three operating conditions. In the flexible MPC condition, the system was activated at 7:00, and there was a sudden decrease in PV generation at 11:00. Utilizing the MPC strategy, the system promptly adjusted its parameters after forecasting a drop in PV power generation. Consequently, the energy consumption of the system was reduced. 4.2.3 Indoor temperature control effect Using Eq. (26) to analyze the room temperatures under different operating conditions. Fig. 24 illustrates the variation in room temperature. Table 18 lists the evaluation indices for room temperature control under the three conditions. This table demonstrates the exceptional control effectiveness of the MPC strategy in regulating the indoor temperature. The difference between the actual and set values of the room temperature was slightly larger in the flexible MPC condition than in the nonflexible MPC condition. This was attributed to the increased fluctuation in the actual room temperature caused by the fluctuation in the set value. In Fig. 25 (a) and (b), the PMV and PPD values corresponding to room temperature at each moment are shown for the three operating conditions. Under flexible MPC operating conditions, the maximum PMV was 0.82, and the PPD was 15%, both of which fell within the specified range. Despite the significant fluctuations in the indoor temperature settings under the flexible MPC condition, the actual room temperature exhibited smaller fluctuations than the set value. This can be attributed to the thermal storage effect of the building, which acts as a flexible building load. Consequently, human thermal comfort is not significantly compromised in comparison with the nonflexible MPC condition. The research objective revolves around achieving a power balance between HVAC system power consumption and PV power generation. To meet this requirement, there is a trade-off with human thermal comfort that remains within an acceptable range, based on the PMV-PPD index. 5 Discussion To track the fluctuation curve of renewable energy generation effectively and ensure the timely consumption of green power to maintain grid stability, this study introduces a flexible load regulation model for HVAC systems using the T-MPC method. The strategy incorporates a prediction model for the cooling load and introduces a cost function to optimize and balance power consumption and temperature control effectiveness. The evaluation is based on two factors: the discrepancy between HVAC system consumption and PV system generation, and the deviation from the desired thermal comfort temperature of 25 °C. The optimal values of the control variables, including the optimized chilled-water supply temperature, chilled-water flow rate, and cooling-water return temperature, were determined through rolling optimization using a GA. The controlled system was operated using a simulation system developed in TRNSYS software. The proposed strategy was then compared and analyzed against the nonflexible MPC strategy and baseline variable flow control strategy. The results demonstrated that the T-MPC strategy efficiently utilizes green electricity, reduces grid volatility, and significantly enhances grid stability. To integrate flexible loads, the flexibility of buildings can be achieved through the thermal storage capacity of the building, HVAC systems, electric vehicles, and adjustable power lamps, or by manipulating energy prices to influence electricity consumption behavior. Building on this, future research can incorporate different types of green power generation regulations, consider buildings as flexible loads, and explore flexible load regulation strategies ranging from individual buildings to regional buildings within the context of widespread green energy integration into the grid. This will enable the coordination of a balanced \u201cenergy source-building load\u201d relationship, reduce grid fluctuations, and enhance power system reliability and stability. 6 Conclusion This study focused on establishing a T-MPC strategy that considers the flexible load of an HVAC system. The deployment of a flexible load for HVAC systems has also been investigated. Furthermore, it addresses the inability of the HVAC system to track the fluctuation curve of renewable energy generation to fine-tune the control. The following conclusions were drawn from this study. (1) This study presents the development of a high-precision prediction model for renewable energy power generation. Two steps are involved in establishing the model. First, a solar radiation prediction model based on the GWO-LSTM algorithm is developed. Second, a PV power generation prediction model based on a BP neural network was constructed. The results show that the GWO-LSTM algorithm improves the MAPE and rRMSE by 6.34% and 4.38%, respectively. This demonstrates the strong predictive performance of the model and provides an implementation method for predicting PV power generation in engineering applications, where solar radiation prediction values are unavailable from weather forecasts. (2) This study introduces a T-MPC strategy for HVAC systems that incorporate flexible loads. The model introduces novel components to the cost function, which includes the system energy consumption curve tracking the PV prediction curve and the room temperature deviation from the optimal human thermal comfort temperature of 25 °C. The effectiveness of the MPC strategy in controlling room temperature was demonstrated through a comparative analysis with a nonflexible MPC operation and a baseline variable flow condition. (3) The evaluation of net load fluctuations is conducted using the concept of \u201cvolatility.\u201d By implementing the T-MPC strategy, the energy consumption curve of the flexible MPC condition was closely aligned with the trend of the PV power generation curve. As a result, the net load volatility decreases to 2.63, which is 47.08% lower than the net load volatility of 4.97 observed without the flexible MPC. In addition, the energy-saving rate reaches 10.89%. These findings demonstrate the high effectiveness and advanced nature of the T-MPC strategy in promoting the grid power balance and stabilizing grid fluctuations. This study revealed the substantial value of achieving a balance between power supply and demand, thereby enhancing grid reliability. Furthermore, the T-MPC strategy, which relies on flexible load management, enables the timely integration of renewable energy and improves the operational efficiency of grid-connected PV systems in buildings. Owing to technical limitations, the data were collected hourly. Hence, existing shorter-term PV power generation prediction models are inadequate. This calls for further research to facilitate the fine-scale adjustment and control of the system. CRediT authorship contribution statement Jing Zhao: Funding acquisition.

        "dc:description": "Building photovoltaic (PV) power generation is intermittent, volatile, random, and uncontrollable; thus, the use of solar grid-connected power generation can lead to a series of problems, such as grid voltage fluctuations and power imbalance. As a typical flexible load, the scheduling and regulation of the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system load can help a grid-connected solar grid achieve balanced and flexible operation. This study proposes a PV capacity dynamic tracking model predictive control strategy for air-conditioning systems with flexible loads. This strategy aims to effectively address the issue of unstable grid-connected output of solar PV systems. In particular, a solar radiation prediction model based on a long short-term memory neural network optimized by the grey wolf optimization algorithm was established, which effectively improved the model prediction accuracy. The cost function of HVAC flexible load control considers the law of solar PV output and the human thermal comfort model. A genetic algorithm (GA) is used to obtain the optimal control parameters for dynamic regulation. The GA was employed to efficiently and effectively optimize the control of flexible HVAC loads, considering the variability of the solar PV output and ensuring human thermal comfort. A dynamic regulation model was developed for a typical office building with a grid-connected solar PV power generation system. TRNSYS was utilized for verification based on the actual measured data and relevant meteorological parameters of the case building. A new evaluation metric, volatility, was proposed to evaluate net load fluctuation. The simulation platform based on the physical building yield results indicated a strong resemblance between the energy consumption curve under the predicted control conditions using the flexible model and the PV generation curve. Additionally, the net load volatility was measured to be 2.63. Compared with the predicted control condition without the flexible model, the net load volatility of the grid was reduced by 47.08%, and the energy-saving rate reached 10.89% in the summer.",
