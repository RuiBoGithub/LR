This study proposes a binary version of the recently developed Equilibrium Optimizer (EO) widely used in various applications. The performance of the proposed Binary Equilibrium Optimizer (BiEO) is evaluated against three classes of mathematical benchmark functions, including unimodal, multimodal, and composition functions. The results of BiEO are also compared to other binary optimizers, including Binary Particle Swarm Optimization with S-shape (BPSO/S) and V-shape (BPSO/V) transfer functions, Binary Dragonfly Algorithm (BDA), and Genetic Algorithm (GA). This study employs an advanced post-hoc analysis of Bonferroni\u2013Dunn test to reveal the significant difference between BiEO and its competitors from the statistical point of view. BiEO has implications for various applications, specifically optimal control problems in buildings due to its rapid convergence rate and simplicity. To assess BiEO efficiency in the building and construction industry, three different test cases are selected: (i) control of switchable Ethylene tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE) cushions, (ii) operation of motorized shades, and (iii) schedule of window opening during natural ventilation. The results from the optimal control problems are analyzed from two perspectives of optimization and building energy performance. The proposed BiEO method shows a fast rate of convergence compared to its competitors in most mathematical and construction case studies (i.e., on average 5 times). This characteristic highlights the merits of BiEO and makes it a powerful binary optimizer specially when there are limited budget of time and iterations for solving an optimization problem and specifically for building applications it allows deploying it to real-time control of building systems and components. The source code of BiEO is publicly available at: https://github.com/afshinfaramarzi/Binary-Equilibrium-Optimizer, https://built-envi.com/portfolio/equilibrium-optimizer/, and https://seyedalimirjalili.com/eo.

Such methods basically learn the characteristics of a problem ranging from simple local to complex global search in order to find the best solution and usually use a high level of abstraction allowing them to be adopted to a wide range of different problems [1]. Based on the nature of the decision variable, the optimization problems are categorized into three classes of continuous, binary and mixed-integer problems. When the decision variable domain is continuous (either bounded or not bounded), the problem is called continuous optimization problem [2\u20134]. When the domain is binary meaning that the variables can be assigned only two states of \u201c0\u201d and \u201d1\u201d or \u201con\u201d and \u201coff\u201d [5], the problem is called binary optimization problem [6,7], and finally when a variable domain can have both continuous and binary states then the problem is called a mixed-integer optimization problem [8\u201311]. Since the majority of the metaheuristics are inherently developed for continuous search space, their structure should be revised for solving binary problems. One of the methods for the conversion of a continuous optimization method to a binary-one (while preserving the concept of the search process) is to use a transfer function and position updating rules [12]. In this method, the process of changing the variable status from \u201c0\u201d to \u201c1\u201d and vice versa is determined by a probability outcoming from the transfer functions which converts the position\u2019s variations into a probability [12]. Transfer functions map a continuous search space into a discrete domain. There are mainly-two classes of S-shape and V-shape transfer functions. The names come from the fact that the shape of the transfer function resembles the word \u201cS\u201d or \u201cV\u201d. Mirjalili and Lewis [12] conducted a comprehensive evaluation on the usage of S-Shape and V-shape families of transfer functions in binary particle swarm optimization methods. They compared the performance of Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) with eight transfer functions (i.e., 4 S-Shape and 4 V-Shape) on different benchmarks and concluded that one of their newly proposed V-shape transfer functions has superior performance compared to the other seven functions of its types and the S-shape family functions. There is very limited literature on binary optimal control problems and application of metaheuristic search methods for solving the problems in the building applications. Most of the literature is focused on limited building optimal control problems such as optimization of room setpoint temperature [13], thermal energy storage [14], or operation of mechanical systems [15] which are not binary. These applications are mostly continuous, discrete, or mixed-integer problems. May-Ostendorp et al. [9] used a model predictive framework to optimally control the sequence of window operation in a mixed-used office building located in Boulder, Colorado. They defined their problem as a mixed-integer problem with the window position as the binary design variable and cooling temperature setpoint as continuous design variables in order to reduce the cooling energy consumption as the objective function. They aimed to solve a model predictive precooling problem with the help of natural ventilation through window opening to meet part of the cooling demand of the building. They reported up to 40 % of cooling energy savings through a near-optimal night cooling strategy. They also used binary particle swarm optimization as the optimization method. Hu and Karava [16] also conducted a study similar to the study already mentioned. They tried to minimize the cooling energy consumption of a mixed-mode building model with variables of window opening position, fan assist, and night cooling schedule within the thermal comfort constraints and then they compared their optimization results with heuristic fixed rules which the mix-mode cooling strategy were able to reduce energy consumption by 83 % compared to the fixed heuristic rules. They also used airflow and energy models to mathematically construct the building model in MATLAB and employed Particle Swarm Optimization embedded in GenOpt software for optimization purposes. Le et al. [17] used a hybrid model predictive method to find an optimal sequence of blind control actions considering four different discrete opening positions of \u201cfully closed\u201d, \u201c25 % open\u201d, \u201c50 % open\u201d, and \u201cfully opened\u201d for the blinds. SIMBAD (SIMulator of Building And Devices), a MATLAB tool box, is used as simulation engine and Branch and Bound method employed as optimization method. Since logical controllers use simple rules for controlling purposes, the authors used Support Vector Machine (SVM) to learn from the behavior of optimal control schedule to extract a simple sequence of operation rules as an input for the logical controller. In another study [18], authors compared four different control strategies for interior roller shades with respect to daylighting and energy performance. The control strategies included the operation of the shades considering that incident beam radiation and incident total solar radiations exceed different thresholds on the façade. The best control strategy (i.e., shades are automatically closed when incident total solar radiation on façade exceeds 200 W/m2) led to almost 20 % annual source energy savings compared to when the shading was fully closed and resulted in 7 % annual source energy savings when the shading was at fully open status. Another study used a fuzzy logic-based optimization to maximize daylight and provide glare control for office spaces using venetian blinds [19]. Combination of GA and fuzzy logic-based is also used in another study to control operation of blinds based on the optimization of blind tilt angle [20]. A different set of publications investigated conducting calibration of energy simulation using optimization for buildings with dynamic shading systems [21]. The focus of these studies was mainly on predicting cooling, heating, and energy consumption patterns or demands rather than developing or testing performance of optimization algorithms. Consequently, this study used most of the relevant studies that had specified the mathematical formulation of the problem and included details about the optimization algorithms used in the publication. The authors recently developed a widely used optimization algorithm, Equilibrium optimizer (EO) [22], inspired by the control volume mass balance model. To extend the use of this algorithm to binary problems, other researchers developed binary versions of EO mainly for feature selection and classification proposes. Gao et al [23] used sigmoid transfer function family (S-shape) with controlling a parameter as β to map the continuous search space into a discrete one to build the binary version of EO. They assessed the performance of their method by a couple of mathematical functions such as Sphere, Quadratic, Schwefel, and Levy functions. With changing the control parameter from the range of 0.1 to 10, they built different S-shape transfer functions and tested the performance of each in their benchmark. They concluded that among all parameters, β = 1/5 and β = 5 showed more promising results than others while they stated that it is difficult to propose a universal rule to simplify the usage of Sigmoid function. In another study, Elmanakhly et al. [24] tried to construct their binary version of EO by combining opposition based learning and an ad-hoc local search method to feature selection purposes. They first compared the performance of two binary EO\u2019s method which is constructed one by an S-shape and another by V-shape transfer function and found out that S-shape performs better on their datasets which finally proposed their method based on the S-shape transfer function. Their local search method works based on the random selection of three features from the existing good solution and switching the values from 1 to 0 and vice versa in an effort to provide a refined solution in the neighborhood. As another example, Gao et al [25] compared different binary version of EO based on the S-shape (BEO-S), V-shape (BEO-V) transfer function family and target based (BEO-T) which use best solution so far as target to propose the better solution. They compared all BEO models with other binary methods such as BGOA [26], BPSO [27] and BGWO [7] and concluded that among all models and methods, BEO with one of the V-shape transfer functions reached the best performance applying on the 19 well-known UCI datasets for feature selection. Other binary variants of EO can be found in [28].Their strategy works based on the learning from different candidates to search the space in a more promising direction applied for feature selection in biological data. The proposed BiEO method in this study tried to take the advantage of the best performing V-shape transfer function among its family [12] along with a mechanism of a random update associated with a high probability of concentration variation which invigorates the exploration ability of the method compared to the other algorithms. The selection of the best performing V-shape transfer function among its family (and not all types of transfer functions) was based on the experimentation conducted in this study. We picked the transfer function that is shown later in the paper since it provided more promising results among its family. 2 Equilibrium optimizer (EO) The search agents in EO are called particles, including concentration which is a representative variable/dimension in optimization terminology. The mechanism of EO is that the search agents randomly update their concentration with respect to some talented particles called equilibrium candidates to reach convergence. EO is a population-based optimization method which means that it needs initialization to start the search process: (1) C i initial → = C min → + rand i → C max → - C min → i = 1 , 2 , ⋯ . . n C i initial → is the initial concentration vector of the i-th particle, C max → and C min → is the upper and lower bounds for the variables, and rand i → is a random vector in the interval of [0,1]. Equilibrium state is the final convergence state of the algorithm, but in the initial iterations there is not any knowledge about the equilibrium state. Hence, the EO method takes advantage of the information of some talented particles called equilibrium candidates to guide other particles to take the correct steps and directions toward the optimum point in the search space. The equilibrium candidates are the four best-so-far particles identified during each optimization iterations plus another particle, whose concentration is the arithmetic mean of the mentioned four particles. These nominated particles are used to construct a vector called equilibrium pool as Eq. (2). shows: (2) C → eq , p o o l = C → eq ( 1 ) , C → eq ( 2 ) , C → eq ( 3 ) , C → eq ( 4 ) , C → eq ( a v e ) Another term that contributes to the EO\u2019s optimization process is exponential term (F). This term helps in having a good balance between exploration and exploitation abilities of the method which is defined as Eqs. (3) and (4) show: (3) F → = a 1 s i g n r → - 0.5 e - λ → t - 1 (4) t = ( 1 - Iter M a x _ i t e r ) a 2 Iter M a x _ i t e r a 1 is a control parameter which contributes to the exploration ability of EO. r → and λ → are random uniform numbers in [0,1]. t is defined as a function of the iteration while Iter is the current iteration. Max_iter is the maximum number of iterations, and a 2 is another control parameter which helps in tuning the exploitation ability of EO. The last term which is one the most important operators in EO called Generation rate (G). This operator helps the EO optimization to provide more an exact solution by enhancing the exploitation and also aid in preventing the solutions from getting trapped in local minima in some dimensions. The generation rate is defined as Eq. (5) shows: (5) G → = G → 0 F → where: (6) G 0 → = GCP → C eq → - λ → C → (7) GCP → = 0.5 r 1 r 2 ≥ G P 0 r 2 < G P where r 1 and r 2 are uniform random numbers in [0,1]. GCP is Generation rate Control Parameter, which determines the possibility of generation term\u2019s contribution to the updating process. The probability of this contribution is determined by another term called Generation Probability (GP) which specifies how many particles use the generation term to update their concentrations. Finally, the updating rule of EO is: (8) C → = C → eq + C → - C → eq . F → + G → λ → V 1 - F → The first term in Eq. (8) is an equilibrium concentration while the second and third term is concentration variations. Consequently, Eq. (8) can be written as Eq. (9): (9) C → = C → eq + Δ C → where: (10) Δ C → = C → - C → eq . F → + G → λ → V 1 - F → Eq. (9) demonstrates that the new concentration of a particle is achieved by the equilibrium candidate concentration plus the variations in the concentration. This variation is formulated in Eq. (10). EO also use a memory saving mechanism to help each particle to keep track of its coordinates. The fitness of each particle in the current iteration is compared to that of the previous iteration and will be overwritten if it achieves a better fit. The mechanism helps particles to not to return to the unpromising areas of the search space with worse fitness values. The simplified pseudo code of EO is presented in Fig. 1 : For more details on how different parameters and terms aid in improving EO\u2019s performance and to understand the detailed pseudo code, the interested readers is referred to the original paper [22] and the code repositories [29,30]. 3 Binary equilibrium optimizer (BiEO) The mechanism of position updating in some optimization methods is based on the concept of \u201cnew position = current position + variations in position\u201d which we call it here as \u201cvelocity-based\u201d methods. Please note that there is not any term of \u201cvelocity-based\u201d methods in optimization literature, and we just introduced and used this ad-hoc term for easy understanding and convenient referring. For example, PSO is a velocity-based method, the term of \u201cvariation in position\u201d is called particle velocity in PSO which is a function of the distance of particle\u2019s current position to pbest and gbest and acceleration coefficient. Another velocity-based and recently developed metaheuristic is Dragonfly Algorithm. \u201cvariations in position\u201d in DA is called \u201cstep vector\u201d which is the function of some terms such as Separation, Alignment, Cohesion, Attraction and Distraction. There are also other velocity-based methods such as GSA, GWO and SSA etc. Using the same terminology, GA is not a velocity-based method since the mechanism of offspring generation is based on the crossover and mutation operators which is different from the velocity-based concept. One of the advantages of velocity-based methods is that the methods that were originally developed for the continuous domain can be easily tuned and restructured for the discrete binary problems using transfer functions. Based on studies [27,31], the status of a search agent can be updated with the probability of its velocity. It means that a transfer function is used to map the velocity values to the probability values to update a position. In simple words, a transfer function defines the probability values for changing the position vector from \u201c0\u201d to \u201c1\u201d and vice versa. In EO, the velocity is considered as the change in concentration formulated as Eq. (10). Some criteria should be considered to select a proper transfer function for mapping a continuous value into a probability-one [31]: \u2022 Since the transfer functions represent a probability, they should be bounded in the interval of [0,1]. \u2022 A transfer function should provide high probabilities of changing the position for large absolute values of velocities since a large velocity indicates that a solution is far away from the optimal values and the position should be changed. It also should be able to provide small probabilities of changing the position for small absolute values of velocities. \u2022 The probability as the output value of a transfer function should increase as the velocity increases because the particles with low fitness function, should have the chance to change their position in order to return to their previous positions. Consequently, the probability should decrease as the velocity decreases. Thus, if a transfer function observes the criteria mentioned above, it is guaranteed that it can be able to successfully map the process of search in a continuous space into a discrete binary-one while almost preserving the search mechanism of the original continuous method. The transfer function that has been used for BiEO is V-shape transfer function [12,28] presented as: (11) P Δ C → = 2 π a r c t a n π 2 Δ C → where Δ C → is the vector of variation in concentration of a particle as Eq. (12) shows: (12) Δ C → = α → + C → - C → eq . F → + G → λ → V 1 - F → where: (13) α → = GP → × ( r a n d > 0.5 ) α → is a vector with the same size as a particle resulting from the multiplication of GP → (vector of GP number) and a binary term of rand > 0.5 . rand is a uniform random number in [0,1]. It means that we generate a random number, if the number is greater than 0.5, then the return value would be equal to 1 and α → = GP → , if the number is less than 0.5, the return value would be 0 and α → = 0 . It is noted that Eq. (12) is originally Eq. (10) with just an added α → value which helps in better exploration ability in the binary domain. The structure of Binary EO is almost the same as the continuous one, except for the variation of concentration in which we use Eq. (12) and Eq. (13) instead of Eq. (10). After calculating the variation of concentration using the equations, the probability vector by transfer function is estimated using Eq. (11). This probability is used in a set of formulas to update the new particle\u2019s concentration in the binary domain as Eq. (14) shows: (14) C i k ( t + 1 ) = C i k ( t ) - 1 r 2 < P i k ( Δ C ) C i k ( t ) r 2 ≥ P i k ( Δ C ) r 1 < 0.5 round ( r ) r 2 < P i k ( Δ C ) C i k ( t ) r 2 ≥ P i k ( Δ C ) r 1 ≥ 0.5 In order to clearly understand, Eq. (13) is written in the array form which \u201ci\u201c denotes the ith particle while k represents the kth concentration of that particle. First, we generate a uniform random number, r 1 , if the number is greater than 0.5, the particle updates it concentration using the formula in the upper brackets shown in Eq (13) otherwise it uses the lower formula. Thus, r 1 is a random number at the particle level and decides the particle should use which formula. It gives the equal opportunity to the particles to update their concentration using different updating rules since the threshold is set as 0.5. After deciding on the particle level, we need to go through the dimension level. Considering the upper formula, in the dimension level we generate another random number, r 2 , and we compare it to the probability value ( P Δ C ) from Eq. (11), If the probability value is higher than r 2 then the concentration of the particle would be its complement shown by C i k ( t ) - 1 . If the probability value is lower than r 2 , then the concentration value remains unchanged. The higher probability shows that the concentration should change its position and lower one shows that it is better for concentration to remain intact. We have almost the same logic for the lower formula, If the probability value is higher than r 2 then the concentration takes a random number of \u201c0\u201d and \u201c1\u201d shown by round(r). r is a uniform random number in [0,1], and round is the rounding operator which turns a real number into its nearest integer. Consequently, if the probability value is lower than r 2 , then the concentration value remains unchanged like the upper formula. The pseudo code of BiEO is shown in Fig. 2 . These pseudo codes represented in Figs. 1 and 2 are helpful for readers to correctly implement the code and observe the hierarchy of each step in the algorithm. Based on the literature review of the developed binary EO versions presented at introduction section, some researchers found out that S-shape transfer function (e.g., sigmoid) showed better performance than the other types for their case [23,24] and some of them reached to conclusion that V-type functions could surpass other types of the functions for their case of study. One of the reasons behind this disagreement might be that none of the studies mentioned above has gone through the extensive evaluation of their method for mathematical functions as well as some real case studies. Except Gao et al. [23] which used only five mathematical benchmarks for method assessment, the others just applied their methods mostly for feature selection. In this study we applied our proposed method (BiEO) to mathematical functions as well as some real-world engineering problems. Our proposed method is designed such a way to take the most advantages of a best performing V-shape transfer function among all families [12] by assigning each candidate to follow an specific rule with equal contribution presented in Eq (14) to the optimization process. The time complexity of BiEO resembles the complexity of its ancestor, EO, plus the complexity of mapping continuous space into a binary-one. Thus, considering n as number of particles, d as number of dimensions, t as number of iterations and c as cost function we can present the BiEO complexity as: (15) O B i E O = O p r o b l e m d e f i n i t i o n + O i n i t i a l i z a t i o n + O ( t f u n c t i o n e v a l a u t i o n ) + O ( t m e m o r y s a v i n g ) + O ( t c o n c e n t r a t i o n u p d a t e ) + O ( t ( b i n a r y m a p p i n g ) ) the overall complexity is defined as: (16) O B i E O = O 1 + n d + t c n + t n + t n d + t n d ≅ O ( t n d + t c n ) 4 Experimental results In this section, the experimental settings are first presented. The results are then covered, discussed, and analyzed. 4.1 Mathematical benchmarks The performance of the proposed BiEO is evaluated against nineteen mathematical benchmark functions in three categories of unimodal, multimodal and composition functions [32\u201334]. Function\u2019s formulas, dimensions, domains and the global optimum are presented in Appendix B. Since the functions are continuous, we converted the continuous variables into a binary-one to perform optimization [12]. To do so, we considered 20 bits for each continuous variable while one bit out of twenty bits is reserved for the sign of each variable. Thus, the dimension of each particle can be calculated by: (17) Dim particle = Dim function × 20 Dim particle is the dimension of each particle, and Dim function is the dimension of particular benchmark functions. Based on Eq. (14) and the dimension of functions presented in the Appendix B, the particles\u2019 dimension for unimodal and multimodal functions would be 100 ( 5 × 20 ) and particles\u2019 dimension for composition functions would be 200 ( 10 × 20 ) . In order to evaluate the proposed BOE method, we need to compare the results to the other binary optimizers. In this study we considered Genetic Algorithm (GA), Binary Particle Swarm Optimizer with S-shape (BPSO/S) and V-shape (BPSO/V) transfer function and Binary Dragonfly Algorithm (BDA). Mirjalili and Lewis [12] conducted a comprehensive study on the performance of Binary Particle Swarm Optimizer with 8 transfer functions; 4 from the S-shape family and the other 4 from the V-shape family transfer functions. The S-shape transfer function used in this study as the BPSO/S showed the fastest rate of convergence among the other transfer functions ( T S x = 1 / ( 1 + e - 2 x ) ) and V-shape transfer function used in this study as the BPSO/V ( T V x = ( 2 / π ) a r c t a n ( π x / 2 ) ) nominated as the best performing transfer function among the other functions in the Mirjalili and Lewis [12] study. For all comparative methods, the number of search agents is set as 30 with the 500 maximum number of iterations resulting in 15,000 function evaluations. The results are presented in Table 1 with average (Ave) and standard deviation (Std) resulting from 20 independent runs for each method. The best average results among the methods are bolded in Table 1. As it is shown in the table, for unimodal functions (F1-F7), the proposed BiEO were able to outperform all the other methods in most of the functions except F5 and F6. In these two functions, BiEO achieved the second-best results after GA. In the multimodal function category (F8 to F13), BiEO has outperformed all the competing methods in all the functions and got the best performing rank without having even a second rank in this class. Finally, in the composition function category (F14-F19) which is the most challenging category, similar to the two other categories, BiEO were able to achieve best results in four out of the six functions compared to the other methods. In F17 and F19, BPSO/S were able to get the best results and were able to outperform BiEO. The reason might be due to the high exploration ability and fast convergence rate of BPSO/S which make it suitable for some functions in this category. Since BPSO/S does not benefit from good exploitation ability, it could not get better results than BiEO in other functions (i.e., F14, F15, F16, and F18). The weak exploitation ability of BPSO/S is clearly observable in the unimodal category functions as it got the worst results among the other methods. Based on the results presented in Table 1, BiEO received the first rank among the other methods and proved that it takes advantage from a good balance between exploration and exploitation ability. Also, the low standard deviation achieved by BiEO in all function\u2019s categories compared to the other competing methods demonstrates that BiEO has a more reliable performance than the other methods and has merits as a good method for binary optimization. It is important to note that since the aim is to optimize the objective function and the methods to find the minimum point of the functions, the lowest average means that a method has the better performance. In addition, there is no need to consider confusion matrix and F1-score, since the problem is the binary optimization not the binary classification, we do not consider the metrics such as \u2018true positive\u2019, \u2018true negative\u2019, \u2018false positive\u2019 and \u2018false negative\u2019. Consequently, presenting confusion matrix and calculating F1-socre is not possible in this case. Fig. 3 shows the averaged optimization history of the methods on three random benchmark functions from each category. In unimodal functions of F1, F3 and F6, shown at the top row of Fig. 3, BiEO showed a very fast rate of convergence toward the optimum point compared to the other methods. The discontinuity of BiEO curve in F1 and F3 is due to the fact that BiEO was able to converge to the global optimum point which is zero in iteration 62 in F1 and iteration 59 in F2 and since the figures are drawn in logarithmic scale in y-axis for better comparison of the methods, it was not possible to show the zero in the figure and that why the discontinuity happened. In F6, although BiEO received the third rank among other methods, the fast rate of convergence is observable in the figure which helped BiEO get to the very competitive results in almost 80 iterations. Among multimodal function categories, BiEO was able to show its efficiency in F11 which performed far better than the other methods in finding the optimum solution. In F8 and F13, BiEO\u2019s performance was almost similar to BPSO/S and GA in the first half of iteration, respectively while surpassing those methods in the second half of iteration reaching better results. In the last category of composition functions, BiEO showed better performance compared to all other methods in F14, while in F16 and F19 BiEO\u2019s performance were similar to BPSO/S. In F16, BiEO reached better results than BPSO/S while in F19, BiEO was defeated by BPSO/S by achieving the second rank. In order to understand which method\u2019s performance is significantly different from the proposed method of BiEO, we run a post hoc statistical analysis of the Bonferroni-Dunn test [35]. This analysis indicates that the performance of two algorithms are significantly different if the difference in average ranking of the methods (i.e., Friedman mean rank) is larger than the critical distance [36]. This test considers a method as a control algorithm to be compared with other methods. In this paper, we considered BiEO as a control algorithm. The details about the theory and practical application of the test can be found in different studies [22,35\u201337]. The bars in Fig. 4 show the average rank of all methods while the horizontal lines represent the threshold value for the control algorithm which is BiEO. The dashed and dotted lines imply a different significance level of 0.1 and 0.05, respectively. The control algorithm is able to significantly outperform the methods for which their average rank is above the threshold line. The threshold line value is calculated by the sum of the control algorithm\u2019s average rank and the critical distance for the specified significance level. Based on the results of Fig. 4, BiEO could significantly outperform all the methods in the statistical point of view. 4.2 Building optimal control problems Three building optimal control problems considered in this study are: (1) optimal control of switchable Ethylene tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE) cushions, (2) optimal control of motorized shades, and (3) optimal control schedule of window openings [38]. All the problems are discretized in time meaning that time as a control node is considered as a design variable of ETFE status assuming that each control node can only have two binary values. In this study, we converted the optimal control problem into a non-linear binary optimization problem which can be solved by a binary optimization method. The problem is to find the control trajectory in order to minimize the objective function uniquely defined for each problem. The control trajectory includes two binary values defined as \u201cdark\u201d and \u201cbright\u201d in the first problem, \u201cup\u201d and \u201cdown\u201d in the second problem, and \u201copen\u201d and \u201cclosed\u201d in the third problem. It is noted that we used 70 search agents along with 400 iterations for all optimization methods in all the three problems. 4.2.1 Optimal switchable ETFE control In this example, we evaluate the performance of the proposed BiEO method on the optimal control of switchable ETFE cushions. The result of optimal control is also analyzed from the energy performance perspective. Switchable ETFE cushions are new technology applied on the envelope and roof of buildings [39]. Its application in buildings is gaining interest due to some mechanical and thermal properties over the conventional construction. The ETFE cushions consist of different layers ranging from one to five layers. The cushions are connected to air inflation units through pipe networks that stabilize the air pressure. By adjusting the air pressure, the ETFE layers can change their positions inside the cushions and create different modes of operation which are dark and bright modes. Dark and bright modes have different thermal and optical properties. Fig. 5 shows a simple representation of how dark (Fig. 5a) and bright (Fig. 5b) mode of the ETFE is created by changing the position of the middle layer in the cushion. Fig. 5c shows Kaplan Institute building with three layers of switchable ETFE cushion located in Chicago, IL. A core-perimeter office building model is considered for this study. The building is modeled based on ASHRAE 189.1\u20132009 High-Performance buildings standard [40] available in the OpenStudio Library [41]. Fig. 6 shows the schematic view of the building. The building is a square shape with 30 m length and 3.05 m height. It consists of four perimeter zones and one core zone. The depth of each perimeter zone is considered as 6.1 m. The building envelope shown as blue area is covered by the ETFE cushions for control purposes. The internal partitions shown as lines in the model roof are used to separate each thermal zone and the HVAC system is considered as an ideal air load system with dual thermostat setpoint schedule for the medium size office building located in Chicago, IL. The setpoint temperature for cooling is set to 24 °C from 6 am to 10 pm during occupied times with a temperature setback of 26.7 °C for unoccupied times. The heating temperature setpoint is set 21 °C from 6 am to 10 pm during occupied times with a temperature setback of 15.6 °°C for unoccupied times [42]. For this study we assumed the three-layered pressure inflated ETFE cushions of Texlon® \u201cVario\u201d constructed by Vector-foiltec company. The thermal and optical properties of the ETFE for both dark and bright mode is presented in Table 2 [43]. The objective function is considered as the total daily source energy use of heating, cooling and lighting. The site to source conversion factor is considered as 3 for electricity and 1.05 for natural gas [44]. The ETFE status in each side of east, south and west direction is considered as design variables. The execution horizon for optimal control problems is considered from 5:00 am to 7:30 pm assuming that ETFE status can be switched every 30 min resulting in 30 control node/design variables in each direction except the north side. Since the north side does not face direct sunlight, we do not control the ETFE on that side and we keep the status as always in bright mode. The ETFE optimal control problem is formulated as: (18) Minimize J ( u → E , u → S , u → W ) = ∑ i = 1 N α Q clg i + Q ltg i + ∑ i = 1 N β Q htg i C o n s i d e r i n g u → E ∈ 0 , 1 30 u → S ∈ 0 , 1 30 u → W ∈ 0 , 1 30 , a n d s u b j e c t t o T z ∈ [ T sch htg , T sch clg ] L z ∈ L sch where u → is the control trajectory, N is number of timesteps for simulation in a day, Q clg , Q ltg and Q htg are the site cooling, lighting, and heating energy consumption (J), respectively. α and β are the site-to-source energy conversion factors for electricity and heating. T z is the zone temperature (°C), and L z is the zone lighting intensity (lx). We also used MATLAB as an optimizer and EnergyPlus as a simulation engine, which the details of co-simulation can be found in [42]. The simulation day that is considered in this study is selected as September 30 as a representative day of shoulder season. September 30 is the fall equinox and represents a typical shoulder season in Chicago, IL. A shoulder season timeframe is considered because it captures days when we usually witness more fluctuations in outdoor temperature during day which helps to trigger more open/close actions of controller. Considering a hot day in summer or cold day in winter will usually leads to a fully dark or fully open ETFE or shade throughout the day [42]. The outdoor dry bulb temperature, direct solar radiation flux, and sky clearness from the typical meteorological year (TMY3) weather file on the simulated day is presented in Fig. 7 . We ran the optimization for the ETFE problem for the representative day and for all the optimization methods. Fig. 8 shows the optimization history achieved by all methods. As it is observed in the figure, BiEO and BPSO/S were able to surpass other methods even in the initial iterations which is due to their high exploration ability to globally search the domain. After almost iteration 30, BiEO could also outperform BPSO/S as well regarding the convergence rate. In iteration 62, BiEO were able to reach almost a stable point which was estimated very close to the solution reached at its final iteration. The optimum daily source energy consumption which is obtained by BiEO and BPSO/V are almost the same as 1.49 GJ (Giga Joule). However, BiEO\u2019s results (1.4897 GJ) were slightly better than the BPSO/V (1.4904 GJ), but the convergence rate of BiEO is observed significantly superior to the BPSO/V. The optimum daily source energy consumption obtained by BPSO/S, BDA and GA is reported as: 1.4972, 1.5238 and 1.5394 GJ, respectively. Therefore, based on the comparison of all methods in Fig. 8, it is realized that BiEO has a good ability to reach the near-optimum solution at initial iterations of the optimization process. This ability is also more or less seen in the mathematical benchmark functions especially in unimodal and multimodal ones. In other words, the proposed BiEO method needs significantly lower iterations compared to the other optimization methods to reach a solution which is almost the same (BPSO/V) or better (the rest) compared to the other methods. It is important to note that in population-based optimizers, the initial steps of optimization can be considered as warm-up period of an algorithm and its performance is not evaluated relying on the initial steps. Additional explanations are added to the text. After understanding the performance of the proposed BiEO compared to the other methods, we aim at analyzing the energy performance of the ETFE optimal schedule estimated by BiEO from the energy consumption perspective. Before going through the energy analysis, a brief explanation on how the ETFE mode can affect each lighting, cooling and heating energy consumption trend can be helpful in better understanding the analysis. When the ETFE is in bright mode, the visible transmittance and solar heat gain coefficient is higher compared to when it is in dark mode. Generally, the high visible transmittance can lower the lighting energy. High solar heat gain coefficient can lower heating energy consumption while increasing cooling energy consumption. When the ETFE is in dark mode, the scenario is the opposite. The low visible transmittance of ETFE dark mode demands for more lighting energy consumption and low SHGC aid in decreasing the cooling energy consumption while increasing the heating one. Please note that the bright and dark mode does not change the insulating property (U-value) of the ETFE. Consequently, a different ETFE mode does not help to preserve or reject the heat inside the building. Fig. 9 shows the optimal control schedule of ETFE achieved by BiEO for three directions of east, south and west while Fig. 10 shows the site lighting, cooling, and heating energy consumption for that optimal control schedule. The lighting energy consumption of the zones (Fig. 10a) shows that the core zone has the highest energy consumption compared to the other zones. It is because unlike the perimeter zones, the core zone does not benefit from daylighting due the partitions which separates the core zones from the perimeter zones. The trend of zones\u2019 cooling energy consumption is depicted in Fig. 10b. The zones need cooling from almost 9:00 am until 5:00 pm. All zones have almost the same trend for cooling with the highest energy consumption attributed to the core zone which is the largest zone among all. Finally, Fig. 10c shows the heating energy consumption for the zones. The demand for heating is observed in the early morning (from 6:00 am to 8:00 pm) and in the afternoon (from 6:00 pm to 10:00 pm). This demand for heating is to set the temperature to its setback value almost in non-office hours. Based on Fig. 9a, in the east perimeter zone, the ETFE would be mostly in the bright mode from 5:30 am until 9:00 am. The reason is due to non-intense solar irradiation (Fig. 7b) in the morning which helps the area to benefit from natural daylighting without significant increase in the cooling energy consumption. From 9:00 am to 11:00 am the east ETFE is switched to dark mode which is aligned with increasing solar irradiation which helps to decrease the cooling demand. From 11:00 am to 5:00 pm the ETFE is then switched to the bright mode. The reason for this switching is that the east side does not face direct sunlight after 11:00 am until sunset, so the optimizer decides to decrease lighting energy consumption by switching the ETFE to the bright mode. The pattern of lighting, cooling and heating energy consumption of the east perimeter zone is observable with the red color in Fig. 10. In the south zone (Fig. 10b), like the east zone, the ETFE is operated in the bright mode from 5:30 am to 9:00 am. After 9:00 am until 3:00 pm the ETFE switched its mode to the dark mode. The reason for this switching is due to increasing temperature (Fig. 7a) and intensity of solar irradiation in the south side (Fig. 7b), and in this interval that the optimizer decides to change the ETFE status to the dark mode. By this change the cooling energy consumption is decreased while the lighting energy consumption will consequently increase. However, it seems that the impact of cooling energy needs is greater than the benefits of natural day lighting that makes the optimizer choose the dark mode in this timeframe. Finally, from 3:00 pm to 5:30 pm the mode will be in bright mode due to the decreasing trend of both temperature and solar irradiation. For the west zone, the ETFE is operated in the bright mode from sunrise to 12:00 pm. This duration is longer than the east and west faces, since there is no direct sunlight in the south face until noon and ETFE operating in the bright mode will lower the lighting energy consumption. Subsequently, from 12:00 pm to 4:00 pm, the west ETFE changes to dark mode in order to minimize cooling energy consumption while after 4:00 pm until sunset (5:30 pm) the ETFE switches to bright mode, as the solar radiation decreases. It is noted that for all the faces, the optimizer prefers to keep the ETFE in the dark mode before sunrise (6:00 am) and after sunset (5:30 pm). We noticed that if the schedule would be in the bright mode in these time frames, there would be a slight increase in heating energy due to low ambient temperature compared to the setback temperature that would affect the office by radiative heat transfer to the outside. 4.2.2 Optimal shading operation We evaluate the performance of the proposed BiEO method with optimal shading operation in buildings compared to the other methods, such as the previous ETFE problem. After comparing different methods\u2019 efficiency on the problem, we technically analyze the energy performance of the shading schedule estimated by BiEO. The fact that 20 %-40 % of energy in buildings is wasted through windows [45] makes this element one of the most important components in the buildings. Adaptive envelopes such as motorized roller shades are applied on windows in an effort to reduce the energy waste while maintaining human comfort [46]. Fig. 11 a shows an internal roller shading device installed on windows, and Fig. 11b presents the schematic view of the roller device connected to the window frame. The roller is a motor which can push down and pull up the shading by rotating around its axis in a clockwise and counterclockwise direction. For the building model we used the core-perimeter office building that had already been used for the ETFE problem with only change in construction and schedule to the DOE Pre-1980 manual. There are two modes of shading operating on the window: \u201cup\u201d and \u201cdown\u201d. The shading is up meaning that shading is rolled up in the housing by the roller and none of the glazing area is covered by shading. The shading is down meaning that the glazing is fully covered by shading. Based on the roller and housing type and installation place, the shading might stick to the glazing or there might be a gap between them. We considered a 5 cm gap between glazing and shading in this study. The optical and thermal properties of the assembly, including the glazing, gap, and shading is modeled by the WINDOW® software [47]. Since the WINDOW® has an extensive library containing different types of shading and glazing from the manufacturers, we arbitrarily used sheerWeave 2410 performance + V22 charcoal grey by Phifer incorporated as the shading used in this study. Both up and down shading mode is modeled by WINDOW® software and optical and thermal properties are brought in the Table 3 . Based on the table, the thermal and optical properties of the down position of the shade is lower compared to when the shade is up. The fact that cloth shade plus the air gap acts as an insulator for the assembly aids in lowering the U-value compared to when the shading is up and the fact that the shading texture is not transparent helps in reducing the Solar Heat Gain Coefficient (SHGC) and visible transmittance (VT) compared to when the shade is up. The objective function for this problem is considered as the same for the ETFE problem as total daily source energy use of heating, cooling and lighting. The difference is that we include the north face shading status as design variables in the optimization process. So, the shading optimal operating problems is formulated as: Fig. 12 presents the optimization history achieved by all methods on the simulation day of 30 September. The curve trend for the methods resembles the ETFE optimization history. The proposed BiEO and BPSO/S methods showed a faster rate of convergence compared to the other methods in the initial iterations. After iteration 20, BiEO tried to keep improving the solutions to own to good global search ability while it seems that BPSO/S got stuck in local optima and was not able to improve the results with the course of iterations. The proposed BiEO method could reach a near optimal solution of 1.9120 GJ daily source energy consumption in only 65 iterations while the optimum solution found by BiEO in the last iteration is reported as 1.9116 GJ. As it is observed in Fig. 12, this slight improvement occurred at iteration 377. The objective function achieved by BPSO/V, BPSO/S, BDA and GA is also estimated as 1.9133, 1.9246, 1.9566 and 1.9609 GJ, respectively. (19) Minimize J ( u → E , u → S , u → W , u → N ) = ∑ i = 1 N α Q clg i + Q ltg i + ∑ i = 1 N β Q htg i C o n s i d e r i n g u → E ∈ 0 , 1 30 u → S ∈ 0 , 1 30 u → W ∈ 0 , 1 30 u → N ∈ 0 , 1 30 , a n d s u b j e c t t o T z ∈ [ T sch htg , T sch clg ] L z ∈ L sch Fig. 13 shows the optimal schedule of shading operation estimated by BiEO for all building faces while Fig. 14 presents the site lighting, cooling and heating energy consumption of the schedule. Comparing energy consumption figures of the shading problem (Fig. 14) with the energy consumption figures of the ETFE example (Fig. 10), one can notice that the site lighting, cooling and heating energy consumption of the shading example is higher than the ETFE example. The reason for this problem is due to the difference between standards. The ETFE example model is based on the ASHRAE 189.1\u20132009 High-Performance buildings standard while the shading example is based on the DOE pre-1980 standard. This selection of standards is intentional to represent our current building stock. ASHRAE 189.1\u20132009 is applicable for high-performance buildings and the ETFE enclosures are installed in new construction. On the other hand, the installation of shades is an energy efficiency measure for older existing buildings, and DOE pre-1980 is applicable for these buildings. Based on the Fig. 13a, the east shading is almost in bright mode from sunrise (6:00 am) to sunset (5:30 pm) except for half an hour which is from 9:30 am to 10:00 am. For the ETFE problem, the east ETFE schedule (Fig. 9a) is in the dark mode after 9:00 am until 11:00 am. The duration of this switch for the shading problem is less than the ETFE one. The reason is due to the difference of VT of the ETFE dark mode and shading down mode. When the shade is down the VT is 0.013 (Table 3), but when ETFE is dark the VT is 0.09 (Table 2) meaning that it demands far more lighting energy consumption to provide the same illuminance compared to the ETFE. Another interesting point is that although the down mode of shade has lower U-value and helps in decreasing the cooling demand, the increase in lighting energy consumption is considerably more than the decrease in cooling energy consumption. Fig. 13b shows the south shading schedule which is set as down from 9:00 am to 14:30 pm which is almost like the ETFE schedule. Since we have the high solar irradiation in the south face for that duration and it demands significant cooling energy consumption, the optimizer decides to switch to dark mode to increase the lighting energy consumption while significantly decreasing the cooling energy consumption. Regarding the west face, Fig. 13c, since the sun reaches to the west face at 1:00 pm, the shade is set to up before 1:00 pm and it turns to down from 1:00 pm to 3:30 pm which we witness the high solar irradiation during that duration. Since the north side does not face direct sunlight, the shading schedule is switched to the up position during the whole day at the north side shown in the Fig. 13d. Another point worth mentioning is that for the ETFE problem, we only considered control nodes in three directions of west, south and east, but for this problem all four directions are considered for the problem. The reason is that since we usually don\u2019t have direct sunlight in the northside of buildings and considering the northside as a single thermal zone, controlling the ETFE or shade in this direction will not significantly affect the heating and cooling energy consumption. The only effect will be on lighting. Thus, keeping the north side of the ETFE or shade as \u2018open\u2019 or \u2018bright\u2019 will help to reduce the lighting energy consumption during the day. In order to make the second problem more challenging for the optimizer, we added the control nodes of this direction to the problem and increased the variables to see if the optimizer is able to reach a pre-known solution. In Fig. 13(d) it is clearly seen that the optimizer was able to reach the solution and keep the shade in an \u2018Up\u2019 status between sunrise and sunset. 4.2.3 Optimal window opening schedule There are a vast number of spaces with inadequate ventilation rate mainly due to lack of mechanical ventilation systems. Unfortunately, examples of these spaces are dormitory rooms or school rooms that typically are related to the educational buildings and have a high occupancy density. Natural ventilation would be the only alternative to bring fresh outdoor air into the rooms and provide thermal comfort and acceptable level of carbon dioxide. So, opening the window would be the only source to bring the outdoor air into the space. The outdoor air is mixed with indoor air to balance the zone temperature and decrease the carbon dioxide emitted by the occupants in the zone. However, not all the occupants are proactive to adjust the windows throughout a day to dilute the space; the lower the number of times that an occupant changes the position of a window the more comfortable they will be. Thus, this example defines an optimal control problem in which we aim at minimizing an ad-hoc term called inconvenience index of occupants as objective function, indicating the total number of times that occupants need to adjust the window position. An occupancy schedule is assumed as the source of carbon dioxide generation. Fig. 15 a shows the schematic of the studied dormitory room highlighted with black color on the roof and south wall as the exposed face to the outdoors. The east, north and west faces are considered as adiabatic meaning that heat transfer to the adjacent rooms and hallway are negligible. The dimension of the room and its installed window on the south face is shown in the figure. Fig. 15b also presents the occupancy schedule for the dormitory room under consideration. The objective function for this problem is considered as the occupant\u2019s inconvenience index subject to the temperature and indoor air quality constraints as follows: (20) Minimize J u → = ∑ i = 1 N - 1 u i + 1 - u i C o n s i d e r i n g u → ∈ 0 , 1 96 , a n d s u b j e c t t o T z ∈ T min , T max C z ∈ [ C outdoor , C max ] where u → is the control trajectory (the schedule of window opening), N is number of control nodes in the execution horizon. The inconvenience index (J) is calculated as the sum of the consecutive difference between the position of the window considered as \u201c1\u2033 for open position and \u201c0\u201d for the closed position. The horizon is considered from 6:00 am to 10:00 pm assuming that the window positions can be switched every 10 min (6 times per hour) resulting in 96 (16 × 6) control node/design variables. T z is the zone temperature while T min stands for the minimum allowable temperature which is considered as 20 °C and T max is the maximum allowable temperature considered as 24 °C. C z is the zone CO2 concentration, and C outdoor represents the outdoor CO2 concentration as 400 ppm and C max stands for maximum zone CO2 concentration as 1,230 ppm [48]. The problem is subject to system dynamics of mass and energy balance equations. The mass balance captures the carbon dioxide concentration in the zone, and the energy balance provides the zone temperature variation for the thermal comfort assessment. It is noted that the detailed calculation of mass and energy balance and the definition of each term are presented in the Appendix B. The mass balance is presented as Eq. (21): (21) dC dt = V ̇ V p C out - C + E V The volumetric flow rate of air already defined in the mass balance equation is calculated by the sum of natural ventilation caused by window opening and infiltration as Eq. (22): (22) V ̇ = V ̇ nat + V ̇ inf Energy balances are used for estimating the variation of temperature in the zone. The equations are formulated around each element (node) to create a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) which can be discretized in time and solved analytically [49,50]. For our model we considered that the heat is only transferred through south wall, roof and floor node considering each node has two internal and external surfaces as: (23) C w i d T w i dt = h w i A w T z - T w i + U w A w T w o - T w i (24) C w o d T w o dt = h w o A w T out - T w o + U w A w T w i - T w o + Q sol wall (25) C r i d T r i dt = h r i A r T z - T r i + U r A r T r o - T r i (26) C r o d T r o dt = h r o A r T out - T r o + U r A r T r i - T r o + Q sol roof (27) C f i d T f i dt = h f i A f T z - T f i + U f A f T f o - T f i (28) C f o d T f o dt = U s A f T s - T f o + U f A f T f i - T f o We assumed that the solar heat gain through the window contributed to increasing the mass temperature inside the room. So, the energy balance from the perspective of mass node is formulated as: (29) C m d T m dt = h m A m T z - T m + Q sol win And finally, the energy balance from the perspective of zone air node is expressed as: (30) C z d T z dt = ρ air V ̇ C air T out - T z + h w i A w T w i - T z + h r i A r T r i - T z + h m A m T m - T z + h f i A f T f i - T z + U g A g T out - T z + Q occ + Q light + Q equip Unlike ETFE and shading problems which are box constrained problems, the window opening problem is a constrained problem. In box constrained problems the bounds are directly applied to the design variables while in constrained problems the bounds are applied on the design variables as well as other parameters defining the problem state or relating different design variables to each other. Depending on the problem and its constraints condition, the search domain is usually divided into feasible and infeasible regions. This division makes the problem more challenging for optimizers to find a feasible solution. Penalty methods are usually used to convert a constrained optimization problem into an unconstrained one [51]. For this example and for all methods we used death penalty method for this purpose. Fig. 16 shows the optimization history for the window opening problem. As it is observed in the figure, all methods start the optimization with an unfeasible guess with an inconvenience index around 107. BiEO and BPSO/S were able to highlight their exploration ability in the initial iterations with finding a feasible solution around iteration 20, while for other methods of BPSO/V, BDA and GA this scenario happened in iterations 190, 235 and 269 respectively. After iteration 20, BiEO was able to improve the results with the course of iteration while its competitor (BPSO/S) could not improve the results. Around iterations 250, BiEO and BPSO/V reached the same solution but before the maximum iteration, BiEO reached a slightly better solution compared to BPSO/V. The optimum inconvenience index achieved by BiEO, BPSO/V, BDA, BPSO/S and GA at the final iteration are reported as 8, 10, 20, 22 and 28, respectively. Fig. 17 a shows the optimal window opening schedule estimated by the proposed BiEO method while Fig. 17b and c shows the variation of CO2 concentration and temperature in the zone, respectively. Fig. 17a shows that the window is kept closed from 6:00 am until 10:10 am. Since the window is closed, we will witness an increase in CO2 concentration and temperature in the zone. The jump in CO2 concentration and temperature at 8:00 am is due to changing the occupancy schedule. The window needs to be opened from 10:10 am until 10:30 am to decrease the concentration and temperature based on natural ventilation. The window will be kept closed after 10:30 am until 12:50 pm and it will be opened again at 12:50 pm until 14:10 pm. We have the peak CO2 concentration as 1,200 ppm (Fig. 17b) and temperature (Fig. 17c) as 23 °C around 13:00 pm. Thus, opening the window will help to reduce the temperature and concentration in the zone. The window opening timeframe will again happen from 17:10 pm to 18:40 pm and from 20:20 pm to 20:30 pm. The occupancy schedule of Fig. 15b shows that at 17:00 pm we will have three occupants in the room until 19:00 pm, this will significantly and immediately increase the CO2 concentration in the room if the window is closed. This is the main reason why the window should be open during this timeframe. Based on Fig. 19a though the ambient temperature trend shows the decrease in this time frame, due to heat gain from occupants, lighting and equipment the zone temperature will not drop below 20 °C as comfort level. This interpretation s is applied for the window opening schedule from 20:20 pm to 20:30 pm as well. A behavior which is observed in the Fig. 17c is that the overall zone temperature\u2019s trend resembles the ambient temperature shown in the Fig. 19a which is low in the morning and night while having a peak around noon. 5 Discussion In this section, we summarize the results of the three building optimal control problems from optimization perspective using BiEO. Since we already discussed the results in detail from the energy savings perspective at each corresponding section, here we aim at providing practical implications of the results. Table 4 presents the optimization results of the control problems already defined in above sections. The first column is the problem under consideration, the second column shows the optimal schedule derived from optimization results, the third column presents the comparative convergence curve for all methods in reaching the optimal solution, and the fourth column shows the front view of the envelope element that is being controlled. It is noticeable that from the convergence curve, shown in the third column of the table, BiEO demonstrated a significantly faster convergence rate compared to its competitors. The convergence rate of BiEO compared to BPSO/V as the second-best performing method can be observed about five times faster in reaching the almost same optimal results in all problems. Since the optimization algorithms demonstrate different behavior in different problems, this paper aimed to first evaluate the efficiency of BiEO against mathematical benchmark functions and compared it to other methods. These mathematical benchmark functions are designed to completely assess our BiEO against other well-known optimization algorithms. After that we tested its efficiency with building optimal control problems with again comparing the method\u2019s performance with other well-known optimizers. Testing a new proposed method against mathematical functions are very important steps in the process of developing a new method. The reason is that these functions are uniquely designed to challenge the performance of optimization methods including a wide range of easy to hard problems (i.e., unimodal (easy), multimodal (medium) and composition (hard)). The performance BiEO was tested against other methods in Table 1, Fig. 3 for mathematical functions, in Fig. 8. Figs. 12 and 16 for engineering problems that compared BiEO against BPSO/S, BPSO/V, BDA, GA. To the best of our knowledge for the engineering problems, we have exhausted the common optimization algorithms. Unfortunately, there are very limited literatures that try to extensively evaluate the performance of a developed method in building applications, and this paper is one of the few that have created a database of binary problems that could be used by other researchers in future to validate their binary optimization algorithms as well as use the source code provided in this paper to deploy to other optimal binary problems in building applications. The results of this study have implications for the building automation systems (BASs). For instance, the proposed BiEO algorithm could assist developing sequences of operation (SOOs) for a near real-time optimal control of shades in buildings. Given the fast convergence rate of BiEO, in tandem with using a day ahead forecast, BASs could utilize the proposed schedules to optimize heating, cooling, and lighting energy consumption patterns. Interested readers are encouraged to read this reference [53]. Similarly, the ETFE problem is a unique example of how an efficient binary algorithm has an immediate application in real buildings (e.g., Kaplan Institute building at the campus of Illinois Institute of Technology). More information about the real implications are available here [42]. 6 Conclusion Equilibrium Optimizer (EO) is a recently developed optimization method inspired by a generic mass balance equation for a control volume. In this article, the binary version of EO was developed and introduced as Binary Equilibrium Optimizer (BiEO). The efficiency of the proposed method was benchmarked with mathematical test functions with a wide spectrum of functions entailing unimodal, multimodal and composition functions. For performance evaluation, the results of BiEO were also compared to other optimizers of BPSO/S, BPSO/V, BDA and GA. Statistically speaking, the Bonferroni\u2013Dunn test is applied by considering BiEO as a control algorithm and revealed that EO had a significantly superior performance compared to the other competitors. In order to more evaluate the performance of the proposed method, BiEO was also applied on three building optimal control problems including, switchable ETFE control, shading operation, and window opening schedule. The results of BiEO were analyzed from two perspectives of (i) optimization and (ii) building energy performance. In all optimal control problems, the estimated schedule provided the minimum total daily source energy use of heating, cooling and lighting. In optimization perspectives, the convergence history of BiEO and other methods were compared from the outlook of methods\u2019 behavior such as results accuracy and convergence rate. BiEO and BPSO/V were able to outperform other methods with showing competitive performance compared to each other. Specifically, for the case of ETFE, the objective function to minimize daily source energy consumption for BiEO, PSO/V, BPSO/S, BDA and GA are estimated as 1.9116, 1.9133, 1.9246, 1.9566 and 1.9609 GJ, respectively. While most of the solutions are relatively similar, BiEO reached to 1.912 GJ (close to its best 1.9116) after only 20 iterations while it seems that BPSO/S was stuck in its local optima and was not able to improve the results as the iterations progressed. This is an important feature of BiEO that has implications for developing sequences operation and also implantation in building automation systems. Thus, these methods were able to provide the most accurate results among all competitors (BiEO showed a little bit better performance). However, BiEO showed a significantly faster convergence rate (approximately 5 times) in reaching the same result as BPSO/V tried in solving the optimal control problems. From the building energy performance perspective, the optimal schedule estimated by BiEO were analyzed and interpreted to fulfill the question that why such an obtained schedule can be considered as the optimal schedule. As another contribution of this study, we developed a set of binary optimization problems for building applications that are suitable for testing future binary optimization algorithms or co-simulations as well as a new optimization algorithm, BiEO, that is a powerful binary optimizer. BiEO is specifically developed for when there are limited computation resources (i.e., time and iterations) available and enables building automation systems to deploy it in near real-time control of building systems and components. Making the source code of BiEO available will power opportunities to extend applicability of BiEO to other building applications as well as other applications.

Appendix B Mass balance In Eq. (18), dC / d t is the rate of concentration change in the zone. In addition, V ̇ , V , P, C out , and E are the volumetric flow rate, the volume of the room, the penetration factor, the outdoor CO2 concentration, and the CO2 emission rate by occupants, respectively. The emission rate is calculated by the number of occupants (Fig. 15 (b)) times the emission rate by one occupant which is considered as 0.31 Liter/min (or 517.5 mg/min). Ventilation Eq. (19) is the sum of natural ventilation and infiltration: (A1) V ̇ nat = 0.025 A opening U wind The natural ventilation is assumed for a single-sided through window opening [54,55]. A opening is the window opening area considered as the half area (i.e., 1 m2) of the window glazing (i.e., 2 m2). U wind is the wind speed. Infiltration is based on the ASHRAE Fundamentals Chapter 16 [56]: (A2) V ̇ inf = ELA 1000 C s Δ T v + C w U wind 2 (A3) ELA = 10 N L × A f ( H H r ) - 0.4 ELA is the effective leakage area.

Δ T w is the difference between wall inside surface temperature and zone temperature. d , e , f are the material roughness coefficients. Δ T r is the difference between roof inside surface temperature and zone temperature. D h = 4 A / p is the hydraulic diameter of the surface equal to 4 times of the surface area divided by the its perimeter. The surface area is the roof. Solar heat gain The total solar heat gain on any exterior surface is the combination of each component of beam, diffuse and horizontal solar radiation [57]. (A7) Q = α I t A s = α ( I b cos θ + I d 1 + cos ϕ 2 + I h ρ g 1 - cos ϕ 2 ) A s α is the solar absorptance of the surface. I t is the total solar irradiation. I b , I d and I h are the beam, diffuse and horizontal solar irradiation, respectively. θ and ϕ denote as the incidence and surface tilt angle. ρ g is the solar ground reflectance, and A s is the surface area. For the south wall we have: (A8) Q sol w = α w ( I b cos θ w + I d 1 + cos ϕ w 2 + I h ρ g 1 - cos ϕ w 2 ) A w And for the roof: (A9) Q sol r = α r ( I b cos θ r + I d 1 + cos ϕ r 2 + I h ρ g 1 - cos ϕ r 2 ) A r the solar gain passing through the glazing of a window is calculated by A9 considering α = 1 and multiplied by the glazing Solar Heat Gain Coefficient (SHGC): (A10) Q sol g = ( I b cos θ g + I d 1 + cos ϕ g 2 + I h ρ g 1 - cos ϕ g 2 ) A g S H G C Internal heat gain We have defined three sources for internal heat gain (i.e., sensible heat gain from occupants, lighting and equipment). Each heat gain is calculated by the multiplication of its schedule and the unit of heat gain that each source creates. (A11) Q occ = E occ Sch occ (A12) Q light = L P D A f S c h light (A13) Q equip = P e Sch equip E occ , Sch occ , L P D , A f , Sch light , P e , and Sc h equip are the heat gain by one occupant, the schedule of occupancy, the light power per floor area, the floor area, the schedule of lighting, the average power of the equipment which is considered as one desktop computer in the room for this study, the operating schedule of the equipment, respectively. Fig. 18 shows the schedule for occupancy, lighting, and equipment.

        "dc:description": "This study proposes a binary version of the recently developed Equilibrium Optimizer (EO) widely used in various applications. The performance of the proposed Binary Equilibrium Optimizer (BiEO) is evaluated against three classes of mathematical benchmark functions, including unimodal, multimodal, and composition functions. The results of BiEO are also compared to other binary optimizers, including Binary Particle Swarm Optimization with S-shape (BPSO/S) and V-shape (BPSO/V) transfer functions, Binary Dragonfly Algorithm (BDA), and Genetic Algorithm (GA). This study employs an advanced post-hoc analysis of Bonferroni\u2013Dunn test to reveal the significant difference between BiEO and its competitors from the statistical point of view. BiEO has implications for various applications, specifically optimal control problems in buildings due to its rapid convergence rate and simplicity. To assess BiEO efficiency in the building and construction industry, three different test cases are selected: (i) control of switchable Ethylene tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE) cushions, (ii) operation of motorized shades, and (iii) schedule of window opening during natural ventilation. The results from the optimal control problems are analyzed from two perspectives of optimization and building energy performance. The proposed BiEO method shows a fast rate of convergence compared to its competitors in most mathematical and construction case studies (i.e., on average 5 times). This characteristic highlights the merits of BiEO and makes it a powerful binary optimizer specially when there are limited budget of time and iterations for solving an optimization problem and specifically for building applications it allows deploying it to real-time control of building systems and components. The source code of BiEO is publicly available at: https://github.com/afshinfaramarzi/Binary-Equilibrium-Optimizer, https://built-envi.com/portfolio/equilibrium-optimizer/, and https://seyedalimirjalili.com/eo.",
