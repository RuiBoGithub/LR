Handling editor: X Zhao This paper proposes a bi-level optimal control strategy for thermally coupled multi-zone dedicated outside air system (DOAS)-assisted HVAC systems, which integrates the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm with Lyapunov function-based reward shaping (LRS) and an augmented genetic algorithm. The proposed strategy aims to maintain indoor air quality (IAQ) and thermal comfort while reducing the overall energy cost. On the upper level, the LRS method enhances the convergence of the DRL algorithm, ensuring satisfactory IAQ with reduced electricity cost. On the lower level, the embedding of the pre-trained optimal agent achieves a unidirectional decoupling, which mitigates model dependency and accurately control thermal comfort under thermal coupling. The proposed strategy offers the following advantages: a) It can efficiently maintain IAQ in multiple zones and high energy efficiency by optimizing the supply airflow, in response to real-time environmental changes. b) It can achieve satisfactory thermal comfort by regulating the fan coil unit power, while implicitly reducing the overall energy costs via unidirectional decoupling. c) Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed strategy achieves a maximum energy savings of 33.13 % and electricity savings of 34.14 %, compared with the traditional strategy. d) The proposed strategy exhibits good generalization ability under different test climates and occupancy scenarios.

Heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems account for more than 51 % of the total energy use in buildings, significantly surpassing other office facilities [3]. For conventional HVAC systems, the air handling units are designed to cover the demand ventilation for indoor air quality (IAQ) as well as the sensible and latent loads for thermal comfort [4\u20136]. However, the discrepancy between thermal loads and ventilation loads may not always match, leading to overestimated outdoor air intake and energy waste [7,8]. Dedicated outdoor air systems (DOAS) are widely recognized as a potential solution to overcome the aforementioned problem by separating the ventilation from the space conditioning, which achieves decoupled thermal comfort and precise IAQ control [9]. The DOAS runs alongside other HVAC equipment serving the building or space to meet the need for outdoor air [10]. The DOAS supplies the required ventilation air to meet the overall space latent load and a part of sensible load. The parallel thermoregulation system, such as variable refrigerant flow system, chilled beams, and fan coil unit (FCU), works in conjunction to handle the remaining sensible load within the zones, ensuring a comfortable thermal environment [11,12]. These DOAS-assisted HVAC systems offer greater flexibility and precision in controlling indoor air conditions compared to traditional HVAC systems, which attracted interest and research [13\u201316]. In recent years, advanced control strategies have been applied to DOAS-assisted HVAC systems to improve the indoor thermal environment and air quality while significantly reducing the system energy consumption. Its effectiveness has been validated in various scenarios, including laboratories [13], offices [14], and classrooms [15], which can achieve about 18∼20 % electricity cost savings under conference and office scenarios [16]. However, the DOAS-assisted HVAC system consists of two parallel systems, which introduces additional control variables and leads to a significant increase in the computational effort required for multi-objective real-time optimal control. As a model-free algorithm that relies solely on environmental interaction, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is proven effective in addressing computationally complex problems associated with optimization control in DOAS-assisted HVAC systems [17]. However, the existing reinforcement learning-based HVAC control strategies are predominantly discussed within single-zone applications, showing deficiency in practical use. Yang et al. [18] proposed a DRL control strategy, which combines a double deep Q network with a prioritized experience replay mechanism, demonstrating strong adaptability to dynamic environmental changes and achieving energy cost reductions of up to 8.56 %. Wu et al. [19] proposed a deep learning framework that combines proximal policy optimization and long short-term memory network, utilizing future state information to enhance control stability and achieving 24.29 % energy savings. Homod et al. [20] propose a deep clustering approach within cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning, which effectively addresses the challenges of data complexity and uncertainty in multi-objective reinforcement learning scenarios. The findings demonstrate an impressive 44.5 % energy savings compared to traditional methods, while maintaining indoor thermal comfort. However, practical HVAC systems usually consist of multiple zones with heat transfer and coupling among each zone [21]. Thus, model-free control methods, including DRL, tend to suffer from poor convergence and limited applicability for multi-zone systems. For practical DOAS-assisted HVAC systems that are thermally coupled, numerical or heuristic strategies are one of the feasible ways for multi-zone optimal control [22]. Kim et al. [23] proposed a centralized multi-objective optimal control strategy using genetic algorithms and response surface methodology, which increases the ratio of the hours satisfying the extended comfort zone by 19.1 % and reduces total system energy consumption by 20.4 %. Li et al. [24] proposed a multi-agent-based hierarchical distributed approach for optimal control of the thermally coupled multi-zone DOAS. Jiang et al. [25] proposed a hybrid modeling-based temperature and humidity adaptive control strategy to improve the set point tracking performance and effectively reduce energy consumption in thermally coupled multi-zone buildings. Mork et al. [26] proposed a distributed model predictive control approach based on a nonlinear Modelica controller for a multi-zone building, considering both thermal and hydraulic coupling, which realizes a 65.0 % reduction in thermal discomfort and a 7.6 % reduction in energy consumption, respectively. Overall, it is difficult to balance between reducing power cost with optimizing IAQ and thermal comfort, under heavy reliance on model accuracy in traditional multi-objective optimization control [27,28]. The main challenges for the optimal control of a DOAS-assisted HVAC system can be summarized as follows: a) Ensuring good IAQ and thermal comfort in multiple zones conflicts with pursing system energy conservation. b) The multi-dimensional control variables arising from parallel systems increase the complexity of the control problem. c) The over-dependence on system model limits the applicability and robustness of traditional optimization control strategies. d) The heat transfer between zones causes significant thermal coupling which can affect the control accuracy of thermal comfort. For this reason, this paper proposes a bi-level real-time optimal control strategy for multi-zone DOAS-assisted HVAC systems to achieve satisfactory IAQ and thermal comfort. The main works of this paper include: a) In upper-level control, a reward shaping-based deep reinforcement learning method is proposed to maintain IAQ with optimized electricity cost. b) In lower-level control, an augmented genetic algorithm is designed for real-time optimization control, with improved control accuracy under multi-zone thermal coupling. c) Decoupling control is achieved for multi-zone DOAS-assisted HVAC systems by embedding the trained upper-level DRL agent into lower-level control. d) The performance and generalization of the proposed strategy have been extensively tested and evaluated under different scenarios. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the multi-zone DOAS-assisted HVAC systems and the control objectives. Section 3 introduces the proposed bi-level real-time optimal control strategy. Section 4 presents the results and relevant discussions. Finally, this paper is concluded in Section 5. 2 Problem formulation 2.1 Introduction of multi-zone DOAS-assisted HVAC systems Fig. 1 shows a typical multi-zone DOAS-assisted HVAC system, which is a DOAS and FCU system. The main components are introduced as follows. (1) Supply fan: The supply fan provides the driving force for airflow movement. (2) Duct network: The duct network distributes the treated air to each zone within the building, which is equipped with dampers and sensors for airflow control. (3) DOAS: The DOAS is a unit that supplies ventilated, dehumidified outside air to each conditioned zone, encompassing an air filter, supply fan, and duct network. In this paper, airflow losses in the DOAS due to duct member friction, dampers, and analogous elements are neglected. It is assumed that the DOAS can accurately deliver a demand airflow to a specified zone through the duct network at each control step [22]. (4) FCU: FCU is a parallel system that provides temperature control for each zone by blowing air over a coil that is heated or cooled by the water from the chilled water piping. It is controlled by an integrated controller that regulates the water valve and the fan speed to adjust zone temperature. Given the integrated control scheme of the FCU, its operation is directly modulated by the supply power [18,19]. (5) Chilled water piping: The chilled water piping transports cold or hot water from the air-cooled chiller to the fan coils in the zones. This study assumes that the pipeline's water supply capacity consistently meets the heat exchange requirements of the FCU. (6) Air-cooled chiller: The air-cooled chiller produces cold or hot water for the fan coil. It works on a refrigeration cycle that transfers heat from the water to the ambient air through a condenser coil. Fig. 2 explicitly shows the thermal coupling effect between two adjacent zones. As can be seen, due to thermal coupling, the temperature change in one zone can cause a hysteresis change in the other zone, which in turn poses challenges for thermal comfort control in multi-zone systems. 2.2 Thermal dynamics modelling and thermal coupling in multi-zone DOAS-assisted HVAC systems In multi-zone DOAS-assisted HVAC systems, the thermal dynamics of each zone are not only related to the external environment, but also take account of the heat transfer from the neighboring zones [29,30]. According to the conservation of heat energy, the zone temperature change can be described as follows [18]: (1) ρ C ρ V i room d T i , t in d t = τ ( P i , t wall + P i , t win + P i , t ven ± P i , t tr + P i , t in ) where C ρ is the specific heat capacity (kJ/(kg⋅°C)); T i,t in is the indoor air temperature at time step t in zone i (°C); τ is the unit harmonization factor to ensure uniformity of physical dimensions; P i,t wall is the heat transfers power through the external walls (roof is treated as a wall [31]) at time step t in zone i (kW); P i,t win is the heat transfers power through the windows at time step t in zone i (kW); P i,t ven is the heat changes due to supply airflows introduced by the DOAS at time step t in zone i (kW); P i,t tr is the heat changes by FCU at time step t in zone i (kW) [32]; P i,t in is the internal heat gain power at time step t in zone i (kW) [33]; ρ is the air density (kg/m3). Mechanistic modeling of each part, P i,t wall, P i,t win, P i,t ven, P i,t tr, and P i,t in are explained in detail in the following. Firstly, the heat transfer power from walls, P i,t wall, depends on the temperature difference between the outside and indoors, and the temperature difference in the neighboring zone is given by Eq. (2) [3]: (2) P i , t wall = ∑ j = 1 N j U wall A j wall T t out − T i , t in + ∑ k = 1 N k U wall A k wall T t out − T k , t neighbor where U wall is the heat transfer coefficient of the walls (kW/(m2⋅K)); N j is the number of walls in direct contact with the external environment; N k is the number of walls that contact with the neighboring zone; A · wall is the area of the jth/kth wall surface (m2); T t out is the outdoor air temperature at time step t (°C); T k,t neighbor is the indoor air temperature of the neighboring zone (°C). As shown by Eq. (2), the heat transfer coefficient of the walls and the adjacency of the zones are the key factors of thermal coupling. The heat transfer coefficient U wall, characterizes the thermal performance of a wall under steady-state heat transfer conditions directly. In practice, a lower U wall-value signifies a more effective insulation effect on the wall, resulting in reduced thermal coupling between the zones. The impact of adjacencies of zones on thermal coupling can be described by an adjacency matrix A ∈ R n × n . The elements in row i and column j of the adjacency matrix A are defined as follows: A i,j = 1 if the ith zone is adjacent to the jth zone, and A i,j = 0 if the ith zone is not adjacent to the jth zone. Secondly, the heat transfer power through the windows, P i,t win, depends on both temperature difference outside and the heat contribution due to solar radiation [34]: (3) P i , t win = ∑ p = 1 N p ( U win A p win ( T t out − T i , t in ) + β p win A p win I t sol ) where U win is the heat transfer coefficient of the windows (kW/(m2⋅K)); N p is the number of windows; A p win is the area of the pth windows surface (m2); β p win is the shading coefficient of the pth window; I t sol is the solar radiation on the window surface at time step t (kW/m2). Thirdly, the supply fan of the HVAC system introduces outdoor air through a duct network to each zone, which causes heat changes by airflow, and this power, P i,t ven, can be calculated by: (4) P i , t ven = ρ C ρ q i , t ( 1 − q l ) ( T t out − T t in ) where q i,t is the supply airflow rate at time step t in zone i (m3/h); q l is the air leakage rate. Fourthly, the FCU adjusts the zone temperature by regulating the water valve and the fan speed. In fact, the FCU has integrated the flow and speed controller that only needs to consider the control power P i,t tr: (5) P i , t tr = η fcu ⋅ P i , t fcu where η fcu is the energy efficiency ratio of the FCU; P i,t fcu is the actual electric consumption for FCU at time step t in zone i (kW). Finally, the internal heat gain, P i,t in, is related to occupancy and electrical appliance heating, which is defined as follows: (6) P i , t in = P person N i , t o + ε appl η appl A p p l per A i room where P person is the power of heat production per person (kW); N i,t o is the number of persons at time step t in zone i; ε appl is the utilization of electrical appliances; η appl is the heat dissipation efficiency of electrical appliances; Appl per is heat density of appliances (kW/m2); A i room is the area of the ith zone (m2). In practice, the temperature of the zones can converge to a steady state within a finite time due to hysteresis in thermal changes of the multi-zone DOAS-assisted HVAC system [19]. Therefore, the differential Eq. (1) can be transformed into a finite difference equation as follows: (7) T i , t + 1 in = T i , t in + τ P i , t wall + P i , t win + P i , t ven ± P i , t fcu + P i , t in Δ t / ρ C ρ V i room where Δt is the time step interval (hour), and the range of T i,t in is [T min in, T max in]. Eq. (7) describes the thermal dynamics and thermal coupling of a multi-zone DOAS-assisted HVAC system subjected to environmental disturbances coupled, which is the governing equation of thermal dynamics for the subsequent control problem in Section 2.5. 2.3 IAQ modeling in multi-zone DOAS-assisted HVAC systems Indoor CO2 concentration is the most commonly used indicator for assessing IAQ. In multi-zone DOAS-assisted HVAC systems, the CO2 concentration in each zone satisfies the gas mass conservation equation [35,36]: (8) V i room d C i , t in d t = q i , t ( 1 − q l ) ( C t out − C i , t in ) + G i , t where C i,t in is the indoor CO2 concentration at time step t in zone i (ppm); C t out is the outdoor CO2 concentration at time step t (ppm); G i,t is the generated indoor CO2 at time step t in zone i (ppm), which can be estimated by: (9) G i , t = N i , t o ⋅ C t gen ⋅ 10 6 where C t gen is the generated CO2 per person at time step t (m3/h), which is related to the parameters of the human body: (10) C t gen = 9.936 ⋅ A D ⋅ R Q ⋅ M E T t ( 0.23 ⋅ R Q + 0.77 ) ⋅ 10 3 where RQ is the respiratory quotients; MET t is the metabolic equivalent of task at time step t (met); A D is the DuBois surface (m2), which is given by the height H and weight W of a person [37]: (11) A D = 0.203 ⋅ H 0.725 ⋅ W 0.425 Generally, CO2 achieves a homogeneous mixture within short minutes in a zone. It allows us to transform the finite difference equation for CO2 concentration in a steady state from differential Eq. (8) as follows: (12) C i , t + 1 in = C i , t in + q i , t 1 − q l C t out − C i , t in Δ t + G i , t Δ t / V i room where the range of C i,t in is [C min in, C max in]. Eq. (12) describes the dynamics of indoor CO2 concentration in the HVAC system, which is used for assessing IAQ in this paper. 2.4 Energy consumption modeling in multi-zone DOAS-assisted HVAC systems The energy consumption of DOAS-assisted HVAC systems is mainly determined by the supply fan and FCU. According to the fan affinity laws [38], the relationships among rotational speed M (RPM), ventilation volume q (m3/h), and power P (kW) of the supply fan at two operation points are as follows: (13) q 1 q 2 = M 1 M 2 (14) P 1 P 2 = [ M 1 M 2 ] ξ where ξ is the fan affinity law exponent, which is equal to 3 in ideal conditions. Taking into account varying fan efficiency and damper openings, ξ is set to 2 in this paper following literature [21]. Hence, based on Eqs. (13) and (14), supply fan energy consumption can be approximated by the following equation [21]: (15) P t fan = P max fan ⋅ ( q t total q max total ) 2 where P t fan is the power of supply fan at time step t (kW); P max fan is the maximum power of the supply fan (kW); q max total is the sum of the maximum airflow rate of all zones (m3/h); q t total is the sum of the airflow rate of all zones at time step t (m3/h), as Eq. (16): (16) q t total = ∑ i = 1 N i q i , t where N i is the number of zones. Another significant factor needing consideration is the power consumed by the FCU in each zone, and the sum of the power in all zones can be calculated as follows: (17) P t fcu , total = ∑ i = 1 N i P i , t fcu where P t fan, total is the sum of the power consumption for FCU at time step t (kW). Overall, the power consumption of the DOAS-assisted HVAC system can be described as follows: (18) P t HVAC = P t fan + P t fcu , total where P t HVAC is the total power consumption of the HVAC system at time step t (kW). In addition, due to the existence of the stepped tariffs [29], it is also necessary to consider the effect of tariffs on the total cost from an economic perspective. Therefore, the total electricity cost of a DOAS-assisted HVAC system is defined as follows: (19) F t HVAC = P t HVAC ⋅ U S D t where F t HVAC is the total electricity cost for the HVAC system at time step t ($); USD t is the electricity price at time step t ($/kWh). 2.5 Control objectives for multi-zone DOAS-assisted HVAC systems a) Objective1: Acceptable IAQ based on upper bound constraint The ASHRAE standard [39] suggests maintaining CO2 concentrations in the zone below the recommended value, to keep a healthy IAQ, for an extended period: (20) C i , t in ≤ C i max , ∀ i ∈ N i , t > 0 where C i max is the maximum allowable indoor CO2 concentration for zone i (ppm). b) Objective2: Satisfactory thermal comfort under thermal coupling effect The operation of DOAS-assisted HVAC systems should satisfy the thermal comfort requirements, which are represented by zone temperature bounds [3] in this paper: (21) T min comfort ≤ T i , t in ≤ T max comfort , ∀ i ∈ N i , t > 0 where T min comfort/T max comfort is the lower/upper bound of the thermal comfort interval (°C). In particular, to achieve the elimination of thermal coupling between multiple zones implicitly, direct constraints on the temperature vector are required: (22) T min comfort ≤ min T t in ≤ max T t in ≤ T max comfort , ∀ i ∈ N i , t > 0 where T t in is the vector of indoor air temperature for all zones at time step t. c) Objective3: Reduced system energy consumption by optimizing supply airflow and FCU power According to ASHRAE standard ventilation requirements, the minimum ventilation rates for HVAC systems are determined by Ref. [39]: (23) q i min = R a × A i room where q i min is the minimum airflow rate in zone i (m3/h); R a is the demand airflow rate required per unit area (L/(s·m2)). In addition, the system operation must abide by the physical limits of the dampers and supply fan, which means the maximum zone and total airflow rates are restricted by the upper physical constraints, given by Eq. (24). However, for energy-saving purposes, the supply airflow can be further limited by Eq. (25): (24) q i min ≤ q i , t ≤ q i max , energy − saving , ∀ i ∈ N i , t > 0 (25) q t total ≤ q max total , t > 0 where q i max,energy-saving is the maximum supply airflow rate with energy-saving requirements in zone i (m3/h); q max total is the maximum total airflow rate for multi-zone DOAS-assisted HVAC systems (m3/h). Similarly, the power of FCU must meet physical constraints and should consider energy efficiency in the meantime. Thus, the range of supply power under energy-saving conditions is given as: (26) P i , t fcu ≤ P max fcu , energy − saving , ∀ i ∈ N i , t > 0 where P max fcu,energy-saving is the upper bound of the supply power of FCU with energy-saving requirements (kW). d) Objective4: Real-time control with lowest electricity cost The control of a multi-zone DOAS-assisted HVAC system must address real-time requirements to achieve objectives (1)\u2013(3) while considering the impact of dynamic step tariffs. Consequently, it is essential to guarantee the real-time minimization of the overall electricity cost of the system at each time step. In conclusion, the real-time optimal control of a multi-zone DOAS-assisted HVAC system can be formulated as an optimization control problem ( P ), as described in Eq. (27), which is graphically illustrated in Fig. 3 : (27) min q i , t , P i , t fcu , i ∈ N i , t > 0 F t HVAC s . t . ( 2 ) − ( 7 ) , ( 9 ) − ( 12 ) , ( 15 ) − ( 26 ) 3 The proposed bi-level optimal control strategy for multi-zone DOAS-assisted HVAC systems 3.1 Architecture of the proposed bi-level optimal control strategy Considering the significant nonlinearity and nonconvexity of the problem ( P ), a bi-level optimal control strategy is proposed for multi-zone DOAS-assisted HVAC systems, as shown in Fig. 4 . The upper level employs an agent trained by the soft actor-critic with Lyapunov-based reward shaping (SAC-LRS) method to estimate the optimal demand airflow of each zone, for IAQ control and energy-saving purpose, where the agent adopts the observational information for decision-making. The lower level adopts an augmented genetic algorithm (AGA) optimization control method which combines the standard genetic algorithm and barrier method, to determine the optimal supply FCU power of each zone, to achieve accurate thermal comfort control under thermal coupling. Fig. 4 illustrates the optimized control flow and information exchange between the upper and lower levels. The two levels exchange information directly and indirectly through the communication layer. Notably, the execution order of the proposed bi-level optimal control strategy aligns with the information flow transmission. Firstly, the upper level receives the environmental feedback from the communication layer, extracts the observation information, and calculates the optimal supply airflow using the pre-trained agent of the SAC-LRS solution. Then, the lower level embeds the pre-trained optimal IAQ control agent into the model. In other words, it embeds the optimal solution of supply airflow (highlighted by the red line in Fig. 4), which implicitly ensures the global optimality and energy-saving efficiency of the optimization results in the lower level. Then, after receiving the environmental feedback, the lower level uses the proposed augmented genetic algorithm optimization method to obtain the optimal power of the FCU through a global and local search, which achieves thermal comfort for all zones. Lastly, the optimal supply airflow and regulated power information are updated to the communication layer to complete the calculation of a time step. A distinguishing feature of the proposed bi-level strategy is that it naturally realizes the unidirectional decoupling of DOAS-assisted HVAC systems [3]. Due to the parallel structure of the system, the temperature of supplied fresh air of the DOAS significantly differs from the required, introducing an additional thermal perturbation to the thermal comfort control. However, the thermo-regulation system, i.e. the FCU system, relies on the internal circulation of the air from the FCUs, which has no impact on IAQ control. It means that the optimal supply airflow is calculated preferentially when optimizing thermal comfort, and the thermal perturbation from the ventilation is implicitly encapsulated by the thermal variation of the model. This sequential output and loading are consistent with the bi-level control logic, which achieves the unidirectional decoupling of IAQ and thermal comfort control. In conclusion, the proposed bi-level strategy reduces the difficulty and computational effort through unidirectional decoupling, while diminishing the dependence system model by adopting the DRL techniques. 3.2 Upper-level control: SAC-based optimal control method with Lyapunov-based reward shaping The upper level aims to achieve IAQ control with minimal supply airflow in multi-zone DOAS-assisted HVAC systems. The optimization control problem is formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP), and a deep reinforcement learning optimal control method based on soft actor-critic and Lyapunov-based reward shaping is proposed to learn the control strategy through continuous interaction with the environment. 3.2.1 Design of DRL elements The IAQ optimal control problem on the upper level can be formulated as a MDP problem, described by a tuple M = (S, A, R, P, γ), where S is the state space, A is the action space, R: S × A→ℝ is the reward function, P is the state transition probability, γ is the discount factor. At time step t, the agent observes the state s t ∈ S of the environment and chooses action a t ∈ A based on the learned policy π: S→A, transferring the state s t to s t+1 according to the transfer probability P, and obtains the reward r t ∈ R feedback from the environment. The goal of RL is to find an optimal policy π*: S→A to obtain the maximal accumulated reward ∑ t = 0 ∞ γ t r t ( s t , a , s t + 1 ) , where r t (s t , a t , s t+1) denotes the reward received on the time step t in MDP. a. State-space formulation The state of DRL is the basis for action decision-making by agents. Hence, variables related to zone CO2 concentrations are included in state variables. Specifically, the state s t compromises the multi-zone indoor CO2 concentration C \u2022 , t in, the outdoor CO2 concentration C t out, the electricity price USD t , the number of occupants in each zone N \u2022 , t o, and their metabolic activity MET t , which is defined as: (28) s t = C 1 , t in , C 2 , t in , \u2026 , C N i , t in , C t out , U S D t , N 1 , t o , N 2 , t o , \u2026 , N N i , t o , M E T t b. Action-space formulation The variation of CO2 concentration in one zone is related to the supply fresh air. Therefore, the action of the upper-level agent is designed as the supply airflow rate for each zone: (29) a t = [ q 1 , t , q 2 , t , \u2026 , q N i , t ] c. Reward function formulation The reward function in DRL defines the goals of the agent's behavior in the environment and provides feedback that guides the agent to optimal strategies. In the upper-level control, the immediate goal is to keep the CO2 concentration in each zone below the specified upper bound during the working hours of the HVAC system. Besides, a lower bound on CO2 concentration is also established to implicitly reduce ventilation and maintain energy efficiency. Therefore, the threshold shaping sub-reward function r 1,t is defined as: (30) r 1 , t = { c 1 − c 2 0 max ( C i , t in ) ≤ C i max a n d min ( C i , t in ) ≥ C i energy − saving max ( C i , t in ) > C i max e l s e where C i,t in is the vector of indoor CO2 concentration for all zones at time step t; C i energy-saving is the CO2 concentration lower bound for energy efficiency militainment (ppm). To reduce the supply airflow rate directly, the airflow regulation sub-reward function r 2,t is introduced: (31) r 2 , t = − max ( q t ) where q t is the vector of supply airflow rate for all zones at time step t; Similarly, to reduce the electricity cost, the cost regulation sub-reward function r 3,t is defined as follows: (32) r 3 , t = − P t fan ⋅ U S D t Considering three parts together, the basic reward function is finally designed as follows: (33) r t = τ 1 r 1 , t + τ 2 r 2 , t + τ 3 r 3 , t where τ 1, τ 2, and τ 3 are the positive weight coefficients. 3.2.2 Design of Lyapunov-based reward shaping The state and action spaces will observe an exponential increase as the number of zones increases in large-scale HVAC applications, which causes the \u201ccurse of dimensionality\u201d for DRL-based methods [40]. Current methodologies mainly incorporate techniques like deep clustering [41,42], expert demonstration [43], and reward shaping [44] to address this challenge. In this paper, reward shaping with potential-based functions is applied to help the convergence of DRL while preserving the optimality of the original policy. The reward shaping is generally given in the following form: (34) r \u2032 ( s t , a t , s t + 1 ) = r ( s t , a t , s t + 1 ) + γ Φ ( s t + 1 ) − Φ ( s t ) where Φ ( s ) : S → R is the potential-based function, r(s t , a t , s t+1) is the original reward value, r'(s t , a t , s t+1) is the reward value after reward shaping. The shaped reward r' still satisfies the Bellman equation, guaranteeing the optimality of the policy. Therefore, the training process can be significantly speeded up if the potential-based function Φ(s) is initialized as an optimal value function V π *(s). However, it is nearly impossible to estimate V π *(s) accurately in complex high-dimensional state spaces, as Φ(s) depends only on the state and ignores the action, which greatly limits the application of reward shaping [45]. To further solve this problem, a Lyapunov function-based reward shaping (LRS) technique [46] can be adopted to accelerate the RL training by introducing actions into the Lyapunov function. From the perspective of stability analysis, the MDP-RL problem can be considered as an optimal control problem. The control scheme is to minimize a cost (negative reward) function, as follows: (35) L ( s t , a t ) = − r ( s t , a t ) where L ( s t , a t ) is the Lyapunov function which is determined by state and action. Motivated by pioneering investigation, this paper adopts LRS to address the challenges in IAQ control of the multi-zone DOAS-assisted HVAC system. A SAC-LRS scheme is proposed following the reward shaping approach, which is given by Eq. (36): (36) r lyap s t + 1 , a t + 1 = r s t , a t + λ lyap γ r s t + 1 , a t + 1 − r s t , a t where λ lyap is a tuning parameter that weights the shaped term γ r ( s t + 1 , a t + 1 ) − r ( s t , a t ) . The proposed SAC-LRS scheme offers the following advantages: a) increased convergence rate of the DRL algorithm; b) unbiased optimal greedy policy of the DRL algorithm and c) guaranteed optimality of the multi-objective control problem. Details can be found in the literature [46\u201348]. 3.2.3 The proposed SAC-LRS solution The proposed SAC-LRS solution is based on the SAC structure, since SAC offers fast convergence, wide exploratory, and good robustness for solving MDP problems of continuous state spaces [49]. SAC aims to maximize the future cumulative rewards while maximizing the entropy, to make the strategy as stochastic as possible. It disperses the probability of the action output rather than concentrating it on a specific action. The flow chart of the proposed SAC-LRS solution is depicted in Fig. 5 . The objective for the SAC algorithm [50] is defined as: (37) J ( π ) = ∑ t = 0 T E ( s t , a t ) ∼ ρ π [ r ( s t , a t ) + α H ( π ( ⋅ | s t ) ) ] where T is the total number of time steps for the agent to interact with the environment; ρ π is the state-action distribution of a policy π; α is the temperature coefficient that aims to control the degree of randomness of the optimal policy and to balance the importance of entropy in reward; H(\u2022) is the entropy value which measures the uncertainty of the probability distribution over actions: (38) H ( X ) = − ∑ x i ∈ X P ( x i ) log P ( x i ) Hence, the optimal policy π* in the SAC follows as: (39) π * = arg max π ∑ t = 0 T E ( s t , a t ) ∼ ρ π [ r ( s t , a t ) + α H ( π ( ⋅ | s t ) ) ] In the process of soft policy iteration, the Q-value can be calculated using the Belman variance based on entropy improvement, and the soft action-value function Q(s t , a t ) can be calculated by Eq. (40): (40) Q ( s t , a t ) = E s t + 1 ∼ D [ r ( s t , a t ) + γ V ( s t + 1 ) ] where s t+1 is sampled from the experience replay pool D, and the soft state-value function V(s t ) is defined as follows: (41) V ( s t ) = E a t ∼ π [ Q ( s t , a t ) − α log π ( ⋅ ∣ s t ) ] In the process of soft policy improvement, the policy π is updated towards the exponential of the new Q-value function, and the KL divergence is used to constrain the policy updates range, the detail is shown as follows: (42) π new = arg min π ' ∈ Π D KL π ' ⋅ | s t \u2016 exp 1 α Q π old s t , a t Z π old s t where π new/π old is the updated/old policy; Π is the feasible set of policies; Q π old ( s t , a t ) is the Q-value function of the old policy; Z π old ( s t ) is the partition function to normalize the distribution; D KL is the KL divergence as shown in Eq. (43): (43) D KL ( X \u2016 Y ) = ∑ i = 1 n ( X i log X i Y i ) where X and Y denote two different distributions. For the multi-zone DOAS-assisted HVAC systems with a continuous state space, the neural networks are introduced as function approximators to implement the soft policy iteration to guarantee the convergence of optimal policy. The SAC algorithm follows the actor-critic architecture [51], which consists of an actor, represented by a policy network, and critics, represented by the soft Q networks. For the soft Q network, parameterized by θ, its parameters can be updated by minimizing the soft Bellman residual: (44) J Q θ = E s t , a t ∼ D 1 2 Q θ s t , a t − r s t , a t + γ E s t + 1 ∼ p V θ ˆ s t + 1 2 where θ ˆ is the parameter of the soft state value function V θ ˆ ( s t ) , which can be calculated by Eq. (45): (45) V θ ˆ s t + 1 = E a t ∼ π Q θ \u203e s t + 1 , a t + 1 − α log π φ a t + 1 | s t + 1 where θ \u203e is the parameter of the target Q network Q θ \u203e ( s t , a t ) , φ is the parameter of the policy network π φ (a t |s t ). In practice, the gradient descent is introduced to update the parameters of the soft Q network because of the use of deep neural networks: (46) θ ← θ − λ θ ∇ θ J Q ( θ ) where λ θ is the update step of the soft Q network, ∇ θ J Q (θ) is the gradient of J Q (θ). Meanwhile, the parameters update of the target Q network relies on the soft Q network and alternately updates with it as follows: (47) θ \u203e ← λ θ \u203e θ + ( 1 − λ θ \u203e ) θ \u203e where λ θ \u203e is the update step of the target Q network. For the policy network, parameterized by φ, its parameters can be updated by minimizing the KL divergence in Eq. (48) as follows: (48) J π ( φ ) = E s t ∼ D [ E a t ∼ π φ [ α log ( π φ ( a t | s t ) ) − Q θ ( s t , a t ) ] ] Notably, a common strategy to obtain the action of the policy network involves employing the reparameterization trick, which can drastically reduce the amount of computation by constructing continuously differentiable objectives. In this paper, a Gaussian distribution function f(·) is chosen for action generation: (49) a t = f φ ( ε t ; s t ) = f φ μ ( s t ) + ε t ⋅ f φ σ ( s t ) where the mean μ and standard deviation σ are obtained from f(·); and ε is the noise, sampled from the standard normal distribution. Therefore, Eq. (48) can be reformulated as: (50) J π ( φ ) = E s t ∼ D , ε ∼ N [ α log π φ ( f φ ( ε t ; s t ) ∣ s t ) − Q θ ( s t , f φ ( ε t ; s t ) ) ] By using the gradient descent, parameter updates for the policy network can be implemented as follows: (51) φ ← φ − λ φ ∇ φ J π ( φ ) where λ φ is the update step of the policy network, ∇ φ J π (φ) is the gradient of J π (φ). To adaptively determine the hyperparameter temperature coefficient α, which can be implemented by solving an upper-bound-free constrained optimization problem [52]. An approximate method is to solve the following objective function: (52) J ( α ) = E a t ∼ π t [ − α log π t ( a t ∣ s t ) − α H \u203e ] where H \u203e is the desired minimum expected entropy. Similarly, the temperature coefficient is updated according to the gradient as follows: (53) α ← α − λ α ∇ α J ( α ) where λ α denotes the update step of temperature coefficient, ∇ α J(α) is the gradient of J(α). 3.3 Lower-level control: augmented genetic algorithm optimization control method The lower level aims to maintain the zone temperature in the thermal comfort interval of the multi-zone DOAS-assisted HVAC system. In this paper, a segmented objective function is designed to achieve thermal comfort and overcome the effects of regional thermal coupling. Meanwhile, an augmented genetic algorithm control method is proposed to calculate the optimal power of the FCUs during the operation phase. 3.3.1 Real-time optimization control considering overall costs This section introduces the implementation of real-time optimization control. Initially, the optimal supply airflow rates from the upper-level IAQ control are incorporated, ensuring that the power consumption and electricity cost of ventilation can be evaluated by measurable values. Considering objective 2, we can directly manipulate the temperature vector to eliminate the thermal coupling implicitly for all zones. Consequently, Eq. (22) needs to be explicitly incorporated into the overarching optimization objective. Hence, a segmented objective function for thermal comfort optimization control is designed in Eq. (54), taking into account the reduction of computation: (54) min P i , t fcu , i ∈ N i , t ∈ T normal J 2 = { 0 max T t in ≤ T max comfort a n d min T t in ≥ T min comfort κ 1 ⋅ J t Temp + κ 2 ⋅ J t Cost e l s e s . t . 2 − 8 , 18 , 26 where T normal is the normal operation period; κ 1 and κ 2 are the weight coefficients; J t Cost is the system total electricity cost at time step t (considering both supply fan and FCU); J t Temp is the temperature objective for multiple zones at time step t. J t Temp and J t Cost are defined as follows: (55) J t Temp = | T max comfort − max T t in | + | T min comfort − min T t in | + | T mid comfort − 1 N i ∑ i = 1 N i T i , t in | , i ∈ N i , t ∈ T normal (56) J t Cost = F t HVAC , t ∈ T normal where T mid comfort is the middle value of thermal comfort temperature interval (°C). It can be found that the temperature constraint is included in Eq. (54) for explicit optimization, and weighting factors are designed to alter the preferences of the objective. Furthermore, since Eq. (55) is formalized as a vectorized optimization, the proposed strategy can be extended to other HVAC systems of different sizes and topologies. 3.3.2 Augmented genetic algorithm solution To achieve effective control of the multi-zone DOAS-assisted HVAC system, under the nonlinear and strongly coupled characteristics described in Eq. (54), this paper proposes an augmented genetic algorithm based on the combination of genetic algorithm [53] and barrier method [54] for the lower-level thermal comfort optimization control. The rationale is explained in the following. a) Stage 1 (Global search): As a heuristic neighborhood search approach, a genetic algorithm exhibits good performance in global search under a large-scale solution space, which can quickly converge to the global approximate optimum [55]. The genetic algorithm selects the high-fitness offspring through the continuous evolution of the population in the solution space iteratively by applying genetic operators such as crossover and mutation, until either a predefined number of iterations is reached or a fitness value of an individual is satisfied [56]. The basic genetic algorithm can be defined as a tuple: (57) G A = { C , E , P 0 , M , Ω , Γ , Ψ , T s } where C is the individual coding methods; E is the individual fitness function; P 0 is the initial population; M is the population size; Ω is the selection operator; Γ is the crossover operator; Ψ is the mutation operator; T s is the termination conditions. b) Stage 2 (Local search): To enhance the local search ability of the genetic algorithm, this paper introduces the barrier method, which can provide a strictly feasible solution and enable accurate thermal comfort control at the lower level. However, the barrier method is significantly dependent on the starting point in non-convex optimization problems, requiring good iterative initial solutions from stage 1. The principles of the barrier method are introduced as follows [57,58]: The barrier method under linear constraints can be written as: (58) min x ∈ R n z ⋅ g ( x ) + φ ( x ) s . t . A x = b where x is the decision variables; g(x) is the original optimization problem; φ(x) is the barrier function; Ax = b denotes the equality constraints; z > 0 is a parameter that controls the trade-off between minimizing g(x) and satisfying the constraints. As z increases, the solution of the unconstrained problem converges to the solution of the original problem. The flow chart of the augmented genetic algorithm method is illustrated in Fig. 6 , and the barrier method mainly consists of the following steps. 1) Choose an initial value of the barrier parameter z > 0 and an initial strictly feasible point x(0); initialize the iteration number n b = 0. 2) Solve the unconstrained problem by Eq. (58) using Newton's method. Let x(n b +1) be the solution. 3) Update z by multiplying it by a factor μ > 1, as z = μz. 4) Stop if the duality gap m z is smaller than a desired tolerance ϵ, where m is the number of inequality constraints. Otherwise, increase n b by 1 and go to step 2. 4 Experimental results and discussion 4.1 Experimental settings To validate the proposed strategy, experiments were conducted on the test system shown in Fig. 1. A virtual multi-zone DOAS-assisted HVAC system comprising 5 office occupancy zones was built in MATLAB, the dimension of each is 9 m × 9 m × 3 m. Walls are installed with windows, all of which have an area of 5 m2, and the number of windows is determined by the topology of zones. The connection topology of these zones can be represented by an adjacency matrix AT 0 as follows: (59) A T 0 = [ 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 ] In the built multi-zone DOAS-assisted HVAC system, thermal dynamics modeling is implemented using Eqs. (2)\u2013(7). Firstly, the FCU regulates zone temperatures by exchanging heat through indoor circulating air with cold or hot water supplied by the air-cooled chiller, and thermal sensors are deployed to monitor indoor temperatures. Secondly, CO2 dynamics is modeled based on Eqs. (9)\u2013(12). Outdoor air is introduced by the supply fan and delivered to different zones through a duct network based on varying demands. Indoor CO2 concentration is monitored directly by CO2 sensors. Thirdly, energy consumption modeling is based on Eqs. (15)\u2013(19), where the primary sources of energy consumption are the supply fan and the FCU in each zone. Electricity costs are determined through smart power meters deployed in each zone. Lastly, the meteorological data on outdoor CO2 concentration, outdoor temperature, and solar radiation are obtained from local weather stations using an online API. All this information is transmitted via the Internet of Things to the control center, which enforces thermal comfort and IAQ management strategies according to the proposed strategy. In addition, zones are set occupied during 7:00\u201320:00, with occupancy varying with time, as illustrated in Fig. 7 . The value of MET t is set to 2 for medium office activities during 7:00\u201317:00, and set to 1 for light office activities during 18:00 to 20:00. The metabolic rate MET t and the number of occupants transmit to the control center, and analysis is performed within 1-h intervals for each time step. Physical constraints are strictly set for the supply fan and FCU in this paper, the supply airflow rate is set restricted between 87.48 m3/h and 500 m3/h, and the FCU supply power is set restricted between 0 kW and 4 kW. Other parameters are listed in Table 1 . To facilitate the training of the SAC agent for upper-level IAQ control and to meet the constraints of lower-level thermal comfort optimization control, real meteorological data from NASA POWER DATABASE are incorporated (Shanghai city) [59]. The dataset includes outdoor temperature, solar radiation, and tiered electricity pricing for the entire year of 2022. For outdoor CO2 concentrations, random sequences are generated since they vary with regions but have small variations over time. These sequences are constrained by the urban climate variation laws, which enhances the generalization performance of the proposed strategy. Additionally, to assess the control performance and algorithm robustness of the proposed strategy under extreme climate variations, this study examines two climate test scenarios. (1) Climate scenario 1: Hot summer scenario with all-day outdoor temperatures ranging from 25 °C to 40 °C. (2) Climate scenario 2: Cold winter scenario with all-day outdoor temperatures ranging from −2 °C to 12 °C. Figs. 8 and 9 depict the diurnal variation of outdoor meteorological data for a day in winter and summer scenarios, respectively. Fig. 10 shows the structure of the actor-critic networks of SAC. The input of the actor network is the SAC state, and the output is a Gaussian distribution of the action selection. The input of the critic network is the current state and the chosen action of the agent, and its output is a Q-value that measures the action. All intermediate layers use a fully connected layer (FC), except that the standard deviation layer of the actor network uses the SoftPlus activation to ensure the output is positive, while the other layers use the ReLU activation. The Adam optimizer is used for neural network parameter optimization, and L2 regularization is used to prevent overfitting. The training was performed on an Intel Core i7-12700KF@3.60 GHz processor and 32 GB RAM computer on the MATLAB R2022b environment. Table 2 shows the relevant parameters. The proposed AGA method is implemented using the genetic algorithm and barrier method with the parameters listed in Table 2. Furthermore, an \u201cElite retention strategy\u201d is introduced [60] to prevent the destruction of optimal individuals by the hybridization operation, to further accelerate the convergence. Additionally, the logarithmic function is selected as the barrier function, and the algorithm is iterated using Newton's method solver of MATLAB. 4.2 Convergence performance evaluation In this section, the convergence of the proposed SAC-LRS method is analyzed. The weighting parameters λ lypy are set at 0, 1, and 2, which correspond to no-shaping, proper shaping and over-shaping, respectively. This configuration tests the convergence performance under varying shaping intensities. Fig. 11 depicts the evolution of episode rewards across 500 training episodes. The results demonstrate that the reward trajectory when λ lypy = 1 can converge rapidly whiling attaining a higher average value. However, an excessively large shaping reward (when λ lypy = 2) results in reward dilution, rendering the degradation of convergence performance [46]. To further show the effect of reward shaping during training, reward surfaces for various λ lypy values are illustrated in Fig. 12 . It is evident that the reward surface is generally higher than the original after introducing reward shaping. Particularly, when λ lypy = 1, the reward value peaks at approximately 1000 ppm and 300 m3/h. This observation aligns with the constraints imposed by Eq. (30) and Eq. (31) regarding indoor CO2 concentration and supply airflow. Conversely, with λ lypy set to 2, the maximum value of reward occurs around 1000 ppm and 450 m3/h, which is lower than that when λ lypy = 1. This reduction is caused by excessive ventilation, thereby diminishing the reward value, as corroborated by the results of Fig. 11. Overall, the proposed SAC-LRS method can significantly enhance convergence efficiency and attain a higher average reward value. 4.3 Control performance evaluation In this section, the performance of the proposed bi-level optimal control strategy is evaluated in three dimensions \u2013 IAQ control, thermal comfort control, and energy consumption. 4.3.1 Evaluation of IAQ control performance To validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy on the upper level, we compare it with two commonly used IAQ control strategies in the industry, which are implemented as follows. (1) Occupancy-based control strategy: The occupancy-based control strategy relies on the ASHRAE Standard 62.1\u20132020 [39], which computes the regional supply airflow rate based on the zone area and the maximum occupant capacity for IAQ control. The formula for calculating regional demand airflow is as follows: (60) q i , t = R a × A i room + R p × N i , t o where R p is the demand airflow rate required per person (L/s), which takes 2.5 L/s as recommended by ASHRAE. In the test scenario, the area and maximum occupant capacity of five zones are the same, and thus require the same supply airflow rate of 99.3 L/s (357.48 m3/h) per zone. (2) PID-based control strategy: The PID-based control strategy is the most widely employed IAQ control approach that relies on the error between the actual CO2 concentration and the zone setpoint [61]. The PID controller generates control signals within the range of (0, 1) based on the magnitude of the error. These signals are then transmitted through the signal gain module to the dampers at the zone outlet end to adjust blade opening (disregarding damper regulation errors). The control law of the PID controller can be characterized using the following equation: (61) u ( t ) = K p e ( t ) + K i ∫ 0 t e ( τ ) d τ + K d d e ( t ) d t where u is the output signal of the PID controller; e is the error value; K p , K i , and K d are proportional, integral, and differential gains, respectively. During the test period, the CO2 concentration threshold is set to 1000 ppm for a 24-hour cycle. The multi-zone DOAS-assisted HVAC system executes IAQ control operations exclusively when zones are occupied. Otherwise, the supply fan halts (with actually a very small airflow), to avoid conveying unnecessary airflow to unoccupied zones to conserve energy. Fig. 13 illustrates the variations in supply airflow rate and CO2 concentration across 5 zones under different test strategies in 100 h. The results indicate that the proposed strategy can maintain CO2 concentration within the specified thresholds without causing over-ventilation. In contrast, all other test strategies result in over-ventilation. The occupancy-based control strategy keeps CO2 concentration significantly below the threshold with slight violation, whereas it lacks adaptive regulation for periods of low occupancy. The PID-based control strategy has obvious violations as CO2 concentration exceeds the threshold. It fails to track variations in zone occupancy timely due to integral saturation effects, leading to higher supply airflow most of the time. To quantitively evaluate the IAQ control performance of different strategies over a test period, this paper introduces three indicators, which are C e max, C b , and Q Tol . C e max is defined to evaluate the maximum CO2 concentration exceedance: (62) C e max = max C e , where C e = { C i , t in − C i max 0 C i , t in > C i max else C b is defined to evaluate the CO2 concentration violation rate: (63) C b = N c b N i ⋅ N T where N cb is the total number of CO2 concentration violations for all zones during the test period; N T is the number of operation time steps. The total supply airflow, Q Tol , is defined as: (64) Q T o l = ∑ t = 1 N T ∑ i = 1 N i q i , t Δ t Table 3 assesses the IAQ control performance of the three test strategies in terms of the three defined indicators. The results demonstrate that the proposed strategy yields superior performance with the lowest CO2 concentration violations and the total supply airflow. Compared with the other two strategies, the total supply airflow is reduced by a maximum of 22.76 % during the test period, and no CO2 concentration violation occurs. In conclusion, the proposed strategy achieves better IAQ control performance on the upper level. 4.3.2 Evaluation of thermal control performance This section evaluates the effectiveness of the proposed bi-level control strategy in terms of thermal comfort under regional thermal coupling. Tests were conducted under different heat transfer coefficients and different HVAC topologies. Considering the wall heat transfer coefficient, the U wall, is related to the degree of thermal coupling between zone, and a higher value implies stronger thermal coupling, implying a greater difficulty in achieving thermal comfort, a set of U wall = [0.17, 0.3, 0.45, 0.63] (W/(m2⋅K)) were tested respectively, to simulate different thermal coupling extent [62]. Figs. 14 and 15 show the thermal control performance and electricity cost of the proposed control strategy under 2 climate scenarios, respectively. As shown, during the system operation, the proposed strategy effectively maintains the temperature of all zones within the thermal comfort range, even under significant temperature differences between indoor and outdoor. Similarly, to quantitively evaluate the performance of thermal control over a test period, this paper introduces two indicators, which are T e max, and T b . The maximum temperature exceedance value, T e max, is defined as: (65) T e max = max T e , where T e = { T i , t in − T max comfort T min comfort − T i , t in T i , t in > T max comfort T i , t in < T min comfort where T e is the difference between the zone temperature and the nearest comfort temperature bound (positive value). The thermal comfort violation rate, T b , is defined as: (66) T b = N T b N i ⋅ N T where N Tb is the total number of temperature violations for all zones during the test period. Table 4 assesses the thermal control performance under different thermal coupling extents during 100 test hours. As can be found, the thermal comfort violation rate and the maximum temperature exceedance value increase with the U wall-values in both test scenarios, implying increasing difficulty for multi-zone DOAS-assisted HVAC control under deepening thermal coupling, which is consistent with the conclusion in Section 2.2. Specifically, the violation rate of thermal comfort can be controlled below 10 % for all test U wall-values. It can be concluded that the proposed strategy demonstrates satisfactory thermal control performance for the thermally coupled multi-zone DOAS-assisted HVAC systems most of the operating time. In addition, this paper also explores the impact of thermal coupling on the thermal comfort control, arising from zone topology. Three test systems of different zone topologies were built, named AT 1, AT 2, and AT 3, with the corresponding topological adjacency matrixes given in Eq. (67). The U wall-value of all structures is set to 0.3. The thermal control performance of each structure is tested in summer and winter scenarios for a duration of 100 h. The results are presented in Table 5 . (67) A T 1 = 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 A T 2 = 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 A T 3 = 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 Table 5 evaluates the thermal control performance under diverse zone topologies. Specifically, the topology AT 3, characterized by a more compact connection compared to the rest two, induces heightened area thermal coupling. A substantial increase can be seen in the thermal comfort violation rate T e max as the system becomes more compact and coupled, and AT 3 yields the highest violation rate. Overall, the thermal comfort violation rates remain below the 10 % criterion for all test topologies by using the proposed strategy. 4.3.3 Evaluation of power consumption and electricity cost This section analyzes the performance of the proposed strategy in terms of power consumption and electricity cost. First, the power consumption and electricity cost are evaluated under various thermal coupling scenarios. Fig. 16 compares the power consumption and electricity cost under various U wall-values and zone topologies across, both summer and winter climate scenarios. It is shown in both test scenarios, that the increase of the U wall-values causes notable changes in power consumption and electricity costs, whereas the structural change of the topology has little effect. Specifically, compared to the baseline (U wall = 0.3), an increase to U wall = 0.63 results in a maximum power consumption and electricity cost increase of 22.76 % and 22.55 % in the summer scenario, and 98.60 % and 90.00 % in the winter scenario, respectively. In contrast, the topology-induced changes are less than 10 % for both power consumption and electricity cost compared to the baseline. Additionally, the overall power consumption and electricity costs are higher in summer than in winter. Summer cooling consumes more energy for two primary reasons: a) it needs to eliminate the heat from the external environment and other zones, and b) it also needs to eliminate the internal heat dissipation within the conditioned zone. In contrast, internal heat dissipation contributes to temperature maintenance during winter, demanding lower additional heating energy. As for the impact of U wall-values, the power consumption in the winter scenario surpasses that in the summer scenario. That is because the increase in U wall-values not only enhances heat transfer between zones but also intensifies the heat exchange between zones and the external environment. It significantly diminishes the thermal insulation performance of the wall, and results in more pronounced heat leakage. Therefore, the indoor/outdoor temperature difference is more substantial in winter than in summer, further increasing energy consumption. The power consumption and electricity cost of the proposed strategy are further compared with traditional strategies over a 100-h period, as shown in Fig. 17 . It can be seen that the proposed strategy demonstrates excellent energy-saving performance, achieving a maximum reduction of 33.13 % in power consumption and 34.14 % in electricity cost compared with the two test strategies, respectively. 4.4 Generalization evaluation In this section, the generalization ability of the proposed bi-level optimal control strategy is evaluated under different occupancy scenarios and thermal scenarios. 4.4.1 Generalization ability under different occupancy scenarios This section explores the generalization ability of the proposed control strategy under different occupancy scenarios. Two test occupancy scenarios are defined as follows: a) Occupancy Scenario 1 (high uniform occupancy): the number of occupants in each zone randomly varies from 3 to 5; b) Occupancy Scenario 2 (medium uniform occupancy): the number of occupants in each zone randomly varies from 2 to 4. Fig. 18 illustrates the IAQ control performance of the three control strategies under two different occupancy scenarios. It can be seen that all strategies can effectively maintain IAQ, ensuring that CO2 concentrations remain below the specified limit in all zones. Nevertheless, the proposed strategy consumes the lowest ventilation power consumption and electricity cost, as detailed in Table 6 . In the two test occupancy scenarios, the proposed strategy achieves a maximum reduction of 24.55 % and 19.85 % in power consumption and 25.79 % and 21.63 % in electricity cost, respectively. In conclusion, the proposed bi-level optimal control strategy exhibits excellent IAQ management performance and generalization ability under varying occupancy scenarios. 4.4.2 Generalization ability under different thermal scenarios This section explores the generalization ability of the proposed strategy under different thermal scenarios. Two test scenarios that distinctly differ from the baseline were set: a) summer scenario with a comfort temperature interval of 24 °C\u201328 °C; and b) winter scenario with a comfort temperature interval of 20 °C\u201324 °C. Fig. 19 illustrates the temperature variation and total electricity cost in all zones under one test day. Quantitative results in 100-h test are presented in Table 7 , where P T HVAC and F T HVAC denote the total power consumption and electricity cost during the test period, respectively. The results demonstrate that the proposed strategy well controls the temperature of all zones within the comfort range under various thermal scenarios, and the overall temperature violation rate is less than 10 %. In conclusion, the proposed bi-level optimal control strategy shows good applicability under different occupancy scenarios and thermal scenarios. 5 Conclusions This paper studies the IAQ management and thermal comfort control problem for multi-zone DOAS-assisted HVAC systems under the thermal coupling effect. A bi-level optimal control strategy is proposed via unidirectional decoupling, considering the parallel structure of the DOAS-assisted HVAC system. The proposed strategy consists of two levels, where the upper-level deals with IAQ management and the lower-level is responsible for thermal comfort control. In the upper-level control, a Lyapunov function-based reward shaping method is used to enhance the convergence of the SAC algorithm, which can effectively maintain IAQ while reducing ventilation electricity costs. In the lower-level control, the unidirectional decoupling is implemented by embedding the pre-trained optimal DRL agent while reducing model dependence, and an AGA optimization method is proposed to accurately control the thermal comfort of all zones under thermal coupling, which implicitly optimizes overall energy costs. The proposed strategy is validated by realistic meteorological data under various scenarios. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy in achieving satisfactory IAQ and thermal comfort under all tested scenarios. Specifically, the temperature violation rate remains below the 10 % criterion in different climate scenarios, with no IAQ violations. In terms of energy savings, the proposed strategy achieves a maximum reduction of 33.13 % in power consumption and 34.14 % in electricity cost, compared to traditional strategies. Additionally, the generalization ability of the proposed strategy was also validated under different occupancy scenarios and thermal scenarios. The limitations of the existing work primarily stem from possible accuracy lacking in system modeling and long computation time required for lower-level control tasks. Future works will explore precise system modeling using joint HVAC simulation software/tools, alongside design of specialized numerical optimization methods for improved accuracy and expedited computational speed. These explorations can enhance the applicability of the proposed bi-level control strategy in practical use.

        "dc:description": "This paper proposes a bi-level optimal control strategy for thermally coupled multi-zone dedicated outside air system (DOAS)-assisted HVAC systems, which integrates the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm with Lyapunov function-based reward shaping (LRS) and an augmented genetic algorithm. The proposed strategy aims to maintain indoor air quality (IAQ) and thermal comfort while reducing the overall energy cost. On the upper level, the LRS method enhances the convergence of the DRL algorithm, ensuring satisfactory IAQ with reduced electricity cost. On the lower level, the embedding of the pre-trained optimal agent achieves a unidirectional decoupling, which mitigates model dependency and accurately control thermal comfort under thermal coupling. The proposed strategy offers the following advantages: a) It can efficiently maintain IAQ in multiple zones and high energy efficiency by optimizing the supply airflow, in response to real-time environmental changes. b) It can achieve satisfactory thermal comfort by regulating the fan coil unit power, while implicitly reducing the overall energy costs via unidirectional decoupling. c) Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed strategy achieves a maximum energy savings of 33.13 % and electricity savings of 34.14 %, compared with the traditional strategy. d) The proposed strategy exhibits good generalization ability under different test climates and occupancy scenarios.",
