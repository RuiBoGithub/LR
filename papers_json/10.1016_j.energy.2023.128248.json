The solutions on current researches mainly focus on heat prediction of demand side, so that the supply temperature can be adjusted according to the predicted heat demand and achieve a heat balance. However, this requires a significant amount of historical data, which limits their applicability. And the lack of pre-simulation platform of the new strategies makes their practical application more difficult. In this paper, a digital twinning of secondary district heating system (DHS) is created, which considers both human behavior and radiator heat dissipation characteristics. A new supply temperature regulate strategy based on indoor temperature feedback is proposed. It contains an indoor temperature prediction model, which require a small amount of measured data and can keep the prediction error within ±0.6 °C. The control effects are analyzed by comparing the proposed regulation strategy with the weather compensator. The result shows that the new temperature regulate strategy is superior to the weather compensator in maintaining indoor temperature and can save energy by 5.4%.

As of the latest statistics, the area of central district heating is 13.1 billion square meters [1]. With the price reduction of intelligent facility, most secondary district heating system (DHS) in China has realized the remote collection of end-users\u2019 data and sending the control signal. Compared with countries with advanced heating technology in Europe, such as Denmark, there is still much space of Chinese DHS for improvement [2]. However, the forms of DHS in two countries are not exactly the same, such as the heating season, district heating system forms and end users [3]. The scale of secondary DHS in China is more complex with larger substation for a group of building. The typical end users in China are usually high-rise and multi-family buildings, which brings new problems [4,5]. The goal of the DHS is to make a balance with the heat supply and the heat demand to maintain a comfortable indoor temperature. Due to the low management level of DHS in China, a good heat balance between the supply and demand is always considered by keeping the return temperatures all the same for each multi-family buildings, which are used temperature sensors to measure. However, this regulation strategy can only reflect that the flow rates obtained by the buildings from the pump is identical and cannot directly reflect the indoor temperature. When the heat supply from the heating substation is higher than the heat demand of buildings, overheating issue will occur and vice versa. Therefore, many scholars have proposed to use room temperature as an indicator of heat balance [6\u20139]. Both the personal activities and the thermal inertia of the buildings will have a certain impact on indoor temperature [10]. Yuan et al. [11] considered both the effects of building thermal inertia and occupant behavior on indoor temperature. Zwan et al. [12] also considered the thermal inertia of buildings and acceptable indoor temperature when regulating the heat supply. However, it is difficult to obtain the behavior of occupant with high accuracy at all the time. And the building thermal inertia is also hard to measure. The dispatching strategy of heat balance based on indoor temperature can be divided by flow rate regulation and supply temperature regulation. Due to the heat bill is fixed and charged by floor heating areas in China, the end users have less incentive to regulate the target indoor temperature when the heat supply exceeds the heat demand. On the contrary, consumers will complain to the heating enterprises if the heat supply is not enough. Besides that, the hydraulic balance valve installed in each building remains unchanged after the initial adjustment. As a result, the flow rate of heating medium flown into each building remains unchanged. Therefore, the most efficient way to meet the heat demand is to regulate the supply temperature of the heating substation [13\u201315]. Conventionally, the supply temperature is regulated by weather compensators in secondary DHS, which the inlet temperature of radiators is the function of outdoor temperature [16]. The essence of its control logic is feed forward control. The advantage of the weather compensator is easy to model, but the disadvantage of it is easy to mismatch the heat balance of supply and demand. Black-box model based on purely data-driven becomes increasingly popular for supply temperature regulation [17\u201319]. The principle is to use the black-box models to predict the heat demand of buildings and then adjust the supply temperature to make a balance between supply and demand. Gu et al. [20] established a prediction model using historical operating parameters of a heat substation, outdoor temperature, and indoor temperature, which adopted different algorithms including extreme learning machine (ELM), support vector machine (SVM), and genetic algorithm-back propagation neural network (GA-BP). The results showed that the SVM has the highest prediction accuracy. Building on this work, Yuan et al. [21] incorporated the building thermal inertia and found that considering thermal inertia had a significant impact on prediction accuracy. Xue el al [22]. developed a prediction model for heat substation based on attention long short term memory (ALSTM). Compared with other advanced prediction algorithms, the proposed model achieved an accuracy of 97.9%. A method for identifying heat substation unsuitable setback at night based on convolutional neural networks and transfer learning was proposed [23]. It enabled the inspection of heat substations by analyzing thermal images, which allows timely detection of heating problems. However, these models all require a significant amount of historical data set, which limits their applicability for newly built heat substations or those with limited amounts of data available. To tackle the mentioned issue, Aoun et al. [24] developed a gray-box model that utilizes building operational data to regress certain parameters and implemented mixed integer linear programming-based model predictive control (MPC) strategy to adjust the supply temperature. The results demonstrated that the proposed strategy is cost-efficient, while providing a well indoor thermal comfort level. Steer et al. [25] established a heat transfer model for heating pipelines and analyzed the relationship between DH operation costs and the frequency of adjusting the supply temperature. The results showed that operating costs can be reduced through appropriate control period selection by saving 5%\u201324% compared with constant supply temperature strategy. However, the regulation strategy of supply temperature is not allowed to implement in most cases. It is because that the heating enterprises are worried about the imbalance between heat supply and demand after adopting the new regulation strategy, which causes consumer to complaint. Besides that, there were many issues during the test period, such as the lack of the consumer cooperations and the damage of the temperature sensors. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a simulation test bed of the secondary DHS and create a digital twinning. However, there is still a lack of simulation methods considering both the radiator heating system and residential building. For the radiator heating system, the model is typically constructed by using the logarithmic mean temperature difference (LMTD) [26\u201328], which will lead to inaccurate calculations. Pedersen T H et al. [29] confirmed the temperature distribution of the radiator is uniform along the horizon and varies with the vertical direction by thermographic investigations. Wang et al. [30] established an accurate model of the radiator in frequency domain. For the residential buildings, RC (Resistance-Capacity) network is often adopted to represent its thermal dynamic [31\u201335], but it cannot simulate the impact of human behavior on the buildings. The EnergyPlus (EP) can solve the above issues efficiently and has been proved by several research [36,37]. The simulation test bed of residential building with radiator heating system is proposed in this paper and has been validated by the measured data. The building is simulated by EnergyPlus, whose environment can not only simulate the building thermal inertia, but also can simulate the influence of occupant behavior on indoor temperatures. The mathematic description of radiator heating systems is established by Matlab. Both software exchange data through Ptolemy II for co-simulation [38]. The main innovations of this paper are as follows: A novel simulation test bed for secondary DHS which consider both human behavior and radiator heat dissipation characteristics is proposed. This method enables the pre-simulation of different strategies before the practical application. Additionally, a supply temperature regulate strategy based on indoor temperature feedback is proposed. This strategy incorporates a precise indoor temperature prediction model, which is distinct from the black-box models and can be derived from a small amount of measured data. By compared with the conventional weather compensators, the control effectiveness of the proposed strategy is analyzed. 2 Thermal dynamics building simulation 2.1 Simulation test bed development 2.1.1 Building system The investigated building is a real residential building located in Tianjin, China with total floor area of 1420 m2. Radiator systems are used for heating during the winter period, and it has 6 floors with two households on each floor. Temperature sensors were installed in 4 typical spaces which were selected from 12 households to record indoor temperature, and intelligent control valve was installed at heating inlet of the building to record supply and return temperature. A variety of materials were used in the construction of the envelop, of which the detailed thermal parameters are listed in Table 1 . The Sketchup was used to build physical model of the building, which is shown in Fig. 1 . Since the goal of this article is to regulate the supply temperature of the heating substation, the entire building can be regarded as one thermal zone in order to simplify the analysis. Then some specific details were needed to set in the EP, such as lighting schedule, equipment schedule and occupant behavior. Especially for the radiator system, it is also necessary to set the radiator heating distribution ratio of convection and radiation in EP, which is listed in Table 2 . 2.1.2 Radiator heating system The dynamic model of the radiator can be considered as a one-dimensional heat transfer process because that the temperature distribution of the radiator is uniform along the horizon and varies with the vertical direction [29]. An accurate mathematical description of the radiator can be derived through the heat balance of control volume shown in Fig. 2 . The equation of radiator heat transfer process can be fully described by PDE [39], which is written as Eq. (1). (1) ∂ t ( τ , h ) ∂ τ + u ∂ t ( τ , h ) ∂ x = k R F c w ρ w V [ t a ( τ ) − t ( τ , h ) ] where t (τ, h) (°C) denotes the temperature distribution along the vertical direction of the radiator; τ (s) represents the time; h (m) is the vertical location of the radiator control segment; F (m2) denotes the heat transfer area of the radiator; c w [J/(kg K)] is the heat capacity of water; V (m3) is the volume of the radiator; ρ w (kg/m3) is the density of the water; t a (°C) is the indoor air temperature; u (m/s) represents the speed of the water within the radiator, which can be derived according to the Eq. (2) and k R [W/(m2 K)] is the heat transfer coefficient of the radiator, which can be written as the Eq. (3). (2) u = H V / q where q (m3/s) represents the volume flow rate and H (m) is the height of the radiator. (3) k R = a [ t a ( τ ) − t ( τ , h ) ] b where a and b represent the radiator heating transfer characteristics, whose value can be obtained from the manufactures. Along the vertical direction, the Eq. (1) is discretized into \u201cM\u201d segments by first-order upwind scheme, which yields the ordinary differential equation (ODE). The position of control volume is numbered by i. And the temperature of control volume can be considered as the supply temperature when i is equal to 0. Besides that, the temperature of last control volume can be regarded as the return temperature. Therefore, the radiator heat transfer model could be solved analytically in Matlab. The optimal number of control segments and radiator grid independence has been conducted in our previous work [17]. (4) d t ( τ , i Δ h ) d τ = K t a ( τ ) − ( K + u Δ h ) t ( τ , i Δ h ) + u Δ h t [ τ , ( i − 1 ) Δ h ] where K equals to k R F/(c w ρ w V); Δh denotes the spatial step size, which is related to the number of discrete segments. 2.1.3 System model development The integrated model of multi-family building equipped with radiator heating system is formed by connecting the building system with radiator system. The building system was simulated by EP and radiator system was constructed by Matlab. Implementation of co-simulation required correctness to handling the exchange data between two software and configuring the integrated environment, which is listed in Table 3 . Matlab obtained the temperatures of outdoor and indoor air from BCVTB, which are provided by EP. The outdoor temperature is used to calculate the supply temperature through the weather compensator. Once the supply temperature is obtained, the heat power of the radiator can be calculated according to equation (4). Then the calculated heat power is transferred from Matlab to the EP through BCVTB. From the above analysis, the BCVTB is essentially a platform with global simulation parameters (begin time, end time, time step) for transmitting data between different software, so the configuration file (*.cfg) must be set correctly to guide what data could be transmitted. The Fig. 3 Shows the process of how it works. 2.2 Model validation The integrated model was validated using the average indoor air temperature and return temperature from the four typical users, which were measured hourly between December 20th and January 3rd. The relative error (RE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) were used to analyze the deviation between measured and simulated values. RE can reflect the bias of the model, while RMSE can reflect the model accuracy. The supply temperature and outdoor temperature during the tested are shown in figure (4) . The Fig. 5 shows the comparison between the average indoor temperature and the simulated values, while the Fig. 6 shows the comparison between the average return temperature and the simulated values. (5) RE = | X o b s , i − X sim , i | X o b s , i (6) RMSE = ∑ i = 1 n ( X o b s , i − X sim , i ) 2 n From the Figs. 5 and 6, it can be concluded that the relative error will be larger at the beginning of the simulation, which is due to the initial value of the simulation test bed, and then the relative error will gradually decrease. The RMSE of indoor temperature and return temperature are 0.38% and 0.15% respectively, which indicates the simulation test bed of multi-family building with radiator heating system is accurate. 2.3 Data generation After proving the reliability of the simulation test bed, it was used as a data generator to find a new strategy to regulate the supply temperature in replacement of the weather compensator. The main conditions for data generation are: \u2022 Typical meteorological year (TMY) instead of measured outdoor temperature is used as the weather file. \u2022 The time step (τ s) of the simulation test bed is set as 600s and the simulation period if from November 15th to March 15th with a total for 119 days. \u2022 The influence of occupant activity, light schedule and equipment schedule on indoor air is set in EP according to the design specification. \u2022 The simulation test bed outputs the outdoor temperature (Tout), indoor temperature (Ta), supply temperature (Ts) and return temperature (Th) respectively, which are all data that can be measured in the engineering project. 3 The feedback predictive control strategy A new supply temperature regulate strategy based on indoor temperature feedback is proposed. It contains an indoor temperature prediction model, which can be derived from the following three parts: (1) Develop the ROM of building based the simulated data to predict indoor temperature. (2) Reduce the prediction error by using the real-time indoor temperature (3) Correct the model by eliminating the return temperature to make the prediction more accurate and more suitable for adjusting the supply temperature. The principle of this strategy is to calculate the target supply temperature by using the deviation of indoor temperature between the target value and prediction value, through the digital PID controller. The tunning process relies on the role of proportion, integral and differential in PID calibration. The obtained target supply temperature is used to replace the values calculated by weather compensator. And the method to obtain the target water temperature in heat substation remains unchanged, which the primary electric control valve is still adjusted by the PI controller to reach the target value. Since the control valve on primary side should not be adjusted frequently, determination the regulation period is also essential. As shown in Fig. 7 , the proposed regulation strategy uses the indoor temperature as a feedback signal to achieve heat balance between the supply and demand side. 3.1 Development the ROM based on simulated data Precise control of space-heating requires reduced-order building model. Developing a ROM needs to determine its structure firstly. Among all optional structures, we choose a structure of model with physical meaning, which is called a lumped Resistance-Capacitance (RC) structure shown in Fig. 8 . Different from black-box or purely data-driven models (for example: Artificial Neural Network) which require a large amount of data set, the ROM with RC-structure can be identified with limited data. Another important advantage of its structure is linearity, which is favorable to improve the efficiency of online prediction calculations. The ROM is a 3-order system shown as the Fig. 8, and the fully mathematical description of it is written in Eq. (7) based on the law of energy conservation. The time-invariant parameters of thermal resistances and capacity need to be identified. (7) { C wall d T wall d τ = T out − T wall R 1 + T a − T wall R 2 C R d T R d τ = T s − T R R w 1 + T h − T R R w 2 + T a − T R R R C a d T a d τ = T wall − T a R 2 + T R − T a R R where R (K/W) represents the heat resistances, T (°C) denotes the temperature, and the C (J/K) is the heat capacity. The Eq. (7) can be rearranged in the matrix form as following: (8) { X ˙ = A X + B U y = C X where X is the vector of temperature; U is the vector of input; A is the state matrix; B is the input matrix and C is the output matrix. The elements contained in them are listed as Eqs. (9)\u2013(13). (9) X = [ T wall T R T a ] T (10) U = [ T out T s T h ] T (11) A = [ − 1 C wall ( 1 R 1 + 1 R 2 ) 0 1 C wall R 2 0 − 1 C R ( 1 R w 1 + 1 R w 2 + 1 R R ) 1 C R R R 1 C a R 2 1 C a R R − 1 C a ( 1 R R + 1 R 2 ) ] (12) B = [ 1 C wall R 1 0 0 0 1 C R R w 1 1 C R R w 2 0 0 0 ] (13) C = [ 0 0 1 ] The Eq. (8) is a mathematical description of a continuous-time system. However, the simulation test bed generates data every τ s (s). The mathematical description form of the ROM system must be converted from continuous-time into discrete-time. The discretized system equations can be expressed as Eq. (14). (14) { X ( k + 1 ) = G X ( k ) + H U ( k ) y ( k + 1 ) = C X ( k + 1 ) where G and H can be derived from A and B by the following formula [40]: (15) G = e = A τ s I + A τ s + A 2 τ s 2 2 + ⋯ ≈ I + A τ s (16) H = ∫ 0 τ s e d A t t ⋅ B ≈ ∫ 0 τ s I d t ⋅ B = I + τ s B A genetic algorithm (GA) is adopted to identify the unknown parameters in formula (14) after making a reasonable initial guess for the vector X of ROM. The data used here included the effects of factors such as solar radiation, window heat transfer, and occupant or equipment behavior, etc. on the indoor temperature. The total identified parameters were 8, with 5 thermal resistances and 3 thermal capacities respectively. It took 6 min to identify the unknown values by GA method on a personal laptop with a 2.20 GHz Intel Core i7-8750H and 32G RAM. The identified parameters are listed in Table 4 . The Fig. 9 shows the comparison of indoor air temperature between simulated and predicted values. The red line represents the simulated indoor temperature (Ta) generated by simulation test bed and the gray line denotes the indoor temperature calculated by ROM with RC structure (Ta_RC). The Fig. 10 displays the distribution of prediction errors between Ta and Ta_RC. The best-fit Normal curve in the plot gives the mean and variance of the errors. It can be seen that the identified ROM with lumped RC structure can basically reflect the building thermal inertia and the occupant behavior from the fluctuation trend of two indoor temperature shown in Fig. 9. However, the maximum deviation of prediction error exceeds 3 °C in the Fig. 10. The mean value of the fitted curve is 0.3282, and the variance is 1.0438, which reflects that the distribution of the prediction error is relatively scattered. Therefore, the established ROM model cannot make accurate predictions on indoor temperature. It can only satisfy the general trend of indoor temperature variety. 3.2 Reduction prediction error by using real-time indoor temperature Through the above analysis, the prediction accuracy of indoor temperature calculated by ROM is poor. It is necessary to correct the ROM model by using the current simulated indoor temperature as a feedback signal, which is a common strategy to reduce error. The correction formula is as follows. (17) { T a _ p ( k + 1 ) = T a _ RC ( k + 1 ) + Δ T a ( k ) Δ T a ( k ) = T a _ R C ( k ) − T a ( k ) where k stands for time, which means the kth time step; the subscript a indicates the simulated indoor air temperature by data generator; the subscript of a_RC is the indoor temperature calculated by ROM, and the subscript of a_p is the indoor temperature after feeding back correction. In order to obtain general rules, the following two cases are adopted to compared and analyzed: (1) The supply temperature regulates with the variety of outdoor temperature, according to the weather compensator; (2) The supply temperature is not relevant to the outdoor temperature, and only keeps a change of square wave. The result is displayed in Fig. 11 and the distribution of prediction error between Ta and Ta_p is shown in Fig. 12 . The mean and variance of the best-fit normal curve are also given in the plots. Form the Fig. 11, it can be concluded that the prediction accuracy can be greatly improved after introducing feedback correction, no matter how the supply temperature is regulated. However, the predictive difference of indoor temperature in Fig. 12 (b) is larger than that of the Fig. 12 (a), which reflects that the prediction accuracy depends on the adjustment modes of the supply temperature. When the supply temperature regulates with the outdoor temperature, the temperature difference between Ta and Ta_p is all distribute within ±1.5 °C from the Fig. 12 (a). The mean value of the best-fitted normal distribution curve is −0.0712, and the variance is 0.4636. While form the Fig. 12 (b), the maximum predictive deviation exceeds 3 °C when the supply temperature keeps a change of square wave. The mean value of the best fit curve is 0.4517 and variance is 0.7423 in plot 12 (b), which is larger than the values of Fig. 12 (a). The results show that the prediction accuracy can be improved by introducing feedback and the most of predictive error is maintained within 1 °C. However, the prediction accuracy is related to the regulation modes of supply temperature and there are still some errors exceed 1 °C under some cases. It is necessary to further reduce the predictive error and modified this model. 3.3 Correction the ROM After initial adjustment, the flow rate flown into each building remains unchanged, Therefore the return temperature is related to the supply temperature, outdoor temperature, and the entire heating system. The goal of fine heating is to keep the indoor temperature constant, which means the left-hand side of the Eq. (7) is 0 in a short time. In this way, the relationship between the return temperature and the temperature of supply water, outdoor air, and indoor air can be obtained as Eq. (18). (18) R w 1 R R R 2 R w 2 R R + R w 1 R R + R w 1 R w 2 T h = ( R R R 2 + R 1 R 2 + R 2 2 R 1 + R 2 − R w 1 R w 2 R 2 R w 2 R R + R w 1 R 2 + R w 1 R w 2 ) T a − R R R 2 R 1 + R 2 T out − R w 2 R R R 2 R w 2 R R + R w 1 R R + R w 1 R w 2 T s The thermal resistances in the formula (18) are constant and it can be rewritten as the following form to simply the expression. (19) T h = d T a + e T out + f T s where d, e and f are constant values that can be calculated by thermal resistances listed in Table 4. Based on section 3.2, substitute equation (19) into equation (14) to eliminate the return temperature and make the predictive feedback model more suitable for adjusting the supply temperature. The detailed matrix equation can be derived as follows: (20) [ T wall ( k + 1 ) T R ( k + 1 ) T a ( k + 1 ) ] = [ g 11 g 12 g 13 g 21 g 22 g 23 g 31 g 32 g 33 ] [ T wall ( k ) T R ( k ) T a ( k ) + Δ T a ( k ) ] + [ h 11 h 12 h 13 h 21 h 22 h 23 h 31 h 32 h 33 ] [ T out ( k ) T s ( k ) a [ T a ( k ) + Δ T a ( k ) ] + b T out ( k ) + c T s ( k ) ] where g ij and h ij are elements of the matrix G and H respectively, which are constants after identifying the parameters for the ROM. The subscript i denotes the element position number in matrix row i, and the subscript j represents the position number in matrix column j. According to the laws for matrix operations, equation (20) can be further simplified to get the Eq. (21) as following: (21) { T wall ( k + 1 ) = g 11 T wall ( k ) + g 12 T R ( k ) + ( g 13 + a h 13 ) [ T a ( k ) + Δ T a ( k ) ] + ( h 11 + b h 13 ) T out ( k ) + ( h 12 + c h 13 ) T s ( k ) T R ( k + 1 ) = g 21 T wall ( k ) + g 22 T R ( k ) + ( g 23 + a h 23 ) [ T a ( k ) + Δ T a ( k ) ] + ( h 21 + b h 23 ) T out ( k ) + ( h 22 + c h 23 ) T s ( k ) T a ( k + 1 ) = g 31 T wall ( k ) + g 32 T R ( k ) + ( g 33 + a h 33 ) [ T a ( k ) + Δ T a ( k ) ] + ( h 31 + b h 33 ) T out ( k ) + ( h 32 + c h 33 ) T s ( k ) As the supply temperature coefficients in equation (21) are all equal to zero, a further simplified expression can be obtained. (22) { T wall ( k + 1 ) = g 11 T wall ( k ) + g 12 T R ( k ) + ( g 13 + a h 13 ) [ T a ( k ) + Δ T a ( k ) ] + ( h 11 + b h 13 ) T out ( k ) T R ( k + 1 ) = g 21 T wall ( k ) + g 22 T R ( k ) + ( g 23 + a h 23 ) [ T a ( k ) + Δ T a ( k ) ] + ( h 21 + b h 23 ) T out ( k ) T a ( k + 1 ) = g 31 T wall ( k ) + g 32 T R ( k ) + ( g 33 + a h 33 ) [ T a ( k ) + Δ T a ( k ) ] + ( h 31 + b h 33 ) T out ( k ) The equation (22) can be rearranged in the matrix form: (23) [ T wall ( k + 1 ) T R ( k + 1 ) T a ( k + 1 ) ] = [ g 11 g 12 g 13 + a h 13 g 21 g 22 g 23 + a h 23 g 31 g 32 g 33 + a h 33 ] [ T wall ( k ) T R ( k ) T a ( k ) ] + [ h 11 + b h 13 g 13 + a h 13 h 21 + b h 23 g 23 + a h 23 h 31 + b h 33 g 33 + a h 33 ] [ T out ( k ) Δ T a ( k ) ] Finally, the modified prediction feedback model of indoor temperature can be obtained, which is written as follows. (24) { X ( k + 1 ) = G m X ( k ) + H m U m ( k ) y ( k + 1 ) = C X ( k + 1 ) where G m and H m are modified matrix, whose element is shown in Eq. (23). The vector U m is the modified input vector whose element are outdoor temperature and prediction error of indoor air respectively. In order to test the predictive feedback model, the same cases of supply temperature regulation modes are used as described in section 3.2. One is regulated by weather compensation; the other is regulated by square wave signal. The result is showed in Fig. 13 , and the Fig. 14 displays distribution of prediction error between Ta and Ta_p. The mean and variance of the best-fit normal curve are also given in the plots. It can be seen from the Fig. 13 that no matter how supply temperature regulation modes is, the predicted indoor temperature curve is basically consistent with the simulated indoor temperature curve. It reflects that the modified predictive feedback model has nothing to do with the supply temperature regulation modes. When the supply temperature is regulated by weather compensation, the mean value of the best-fit normal distribution curve is 0.0048 and the variance is 0.1588 in the Fig. 14 (a). While the mean value of the best-fit curve is 0.0036 and variance is 0.2054 in the Fig. 14 (b), when supply temperature adopts the square wave regulation. It means that the obtained corrected ROM has higher prediction accuracy on indoor air temperature, and is not affected by the supply temperature regulation strategy. Besides that, the inputs of this modified model are easy to obtain. 3.4 Determination the adjustment period The supply temperature adjustment period needs to be carefully selected according to the above analysis. And the identified ROM with lumped RC structure was used to obtain the step response of the indoor air temperature to the supply temperature, which was displayed in the Fig. 15 . It can be got from the plot that the time constant is roughly 1.3 h, which means that the indoor temperature achieve stability after the supply temperature changing 1.3 h later. As a result, the supply temperature adjustment period is selected as 1.3 h. 4 Results and discussion 4.1 Analysis of thermal comfortable There are three ultimate goals of heating: (1) make the indoor air temperature reach at the target value; (2) reduce fluctuations of room temperature; (3) make occupants feel thermal comfortable. The target value is set as 20 °C in the simulation test bed. And the simulation test bed was used to simulate the indoor temperature under two different regulation of supply temperature strategy during the winter period. One is regulated by weather compensator and the other is regulated by feedback predictive model. Fig. 16 shows the simulated indoor temperature from November 15th to November 22nd. The red line represents the indoor temperature controlled by feedback predictive model and the gray line denotes the indoor temperature regulated by weather compensator. From the Fig. 16, the maximum indoor temperature is 23.5 °C and the minimum temperature is 18 °C when the weather compensator is adopted to regulate the supply temperature. The maximum deviation value is 5.5 °C. However, when feedback predictive model is used to adjust the supply temperature, the maximum indoor air value is 22 °C, the minimum value is 18.5 °C and the maximum temperature difference is 3.5 °C, which means lower fluctuations of indoor air. From a qualitative point of view, the gray line fluctuates more sharply than the red line, which means that the three goals of heating can be better satisfied with supply temperature regulated by predictive feedback model. With 20 °C as the target temperature, the histogram of temperature deviation between target and simulated values is obtained plotted in the Fig. 17 and the best fit normal curve is also plot in the figure. It can be seen from the Fig. 17 (a) that the maximum deviation between target value and simulated values exceeds 3 °C when the conventional weather compensator is used to regulate the supply temperature. Nearly half of the indoor temperature exceeded the target value by 1 °C, which means that the weather compensator can only adjust the heat balance in a certain extent and is not suitable for fine heating. By this regulation strategy, the mean value of the normal curve is −0.7171, and the variance is 0.9069. The Fig. 17 (b) displays that more than half of the simulated indoor temperature is within ±0.5 °C of the target value, and the maximum deviation does not exceed 2 °C. The mean value of the normal curve is −0.0157 and the variance is 0.5390, which are all smaller than the values of best fit curve regulated by weather compensator. After the above quantitative analysis, the same conclusion can be drawn. Compared with the weather compensator, the predictive feedback model is more suitable for fine heating with multi-family buildings. 4.2 Analysis of supply and return temperature The supply and return temperature are plotted in the Fig. 18 with different supply temperature regulation strategy. The gray solid line denotes the supply temperature controlled by weather compensator and the gray dashed line is the return temperature regulated by weather compensator. While the red solid line and bule solid line represents the supply temperature and return temperature respectively, which are regulated by predictive feedback model. From the qualitative analysis, the Fig. 18 shows that both the supply and the return temperature are lower than those adjusted by weather compensator. Low supply temperature has the following benefits: (1) It is important to exploit the potential of renewable sources and recover waste heat. (2) Reduce heat loss in surrounding soil during the heat transfer. (3) Increase the heat pump coefficient of performance in future low-temperature district heating (LTDH) systems. The lower return water temperature can improve the efficiency of plate heat exchanger in heating substation. For the primary side of DH system, it can reduce the supply temperature from heating producer or reduce the mass flow rate to meet the secondary demand sides of the DHS. It is beneficial to realize the LTDH system in future or save energy consumption by central pump. The temperature difference comparison of two regulation strategies is plotted in Fig. 19 . The black solid line is temperature difference of the first regulation mode adjusted by weather compensator and the orange solid line represents the temperature difference of the second regulation mode regulated by predictive feedback model. The following figure shows that the average temperature difference is lower under the second regulation mode. When the flow rate remains unchanged, the energy consumption can be reduced according to the law of energy conservation. 4.3 Analysis of energy consumption In this section, the energy consumption of the multi-family building with two regulation modes was compared during the whole heating period. The Fig. 20 shows the accumulated heating consumption. The red dashed line represents the regulation mode of supply temperature controlled by the weather compensator, and the blue solid line represents the regulation mode controlled by the predictive feedback model. The total heating energy consumption of the multi-family building during the whole heating period is 320.57 (GW) when weather compensator is used to regulate the supply temperature. The total energy consumption for heating the building is 303.13 (GW), when using the predictive feedback model regulates the supply temperature. The energy saving can reach 17.45 (GW) throughout the heating season, which accounts for 5.44% of conventional weather compensator. 5 Conclusions This paper constructs an efficient and reliable secondary DHS simulation model by co-simulation of EP and Matlab, which can be used to test and analyze different control strategies. A new supply temperature regulation strategy based on indoor temperature feedback is proposed, which contains an accurate indoor temperature prediction model that can be derived by using a small amount of measured data. Through the above analysis, the following conclusions can be drawn: (1) A reliable secondary DHS simulation test bed: the simulation test bed is validated by measured values and the RMSE is used as an indicator of accuracy. The RMSE of indoor temperature and return temperature between simulated and measured values are 0.38% and 0.15% respectively, which shows the reliable of simulation test bed. (2) An accurate indoor temperature prediction model: the current indoor temperature simulated value was used to establish the predictive feedback model, whose prediction error can be kept within ±0.6 °C. (3) Thermal comfortable: the temperature deviation between the simulated indoor air and the target value (20 °C) is calculated and the variance of the best-fit normal curve is also found. The variance is 0.5390 when the supply temperature is regulated by predictive feedback model. However, the variance is 0.9069 when the weather compensator is used to regulate supply temperature. Compared with the weather compensator, the predictive feedback model can provide a good thermal comfortable. (4) Energy saving effect: compared with the weather compensator, the energy saving rate is 5.44% by using the predictive feedback model to regulate the supply temperature.

        "dc:description": "For residential buildings with radiator heating system, the supply temperature is conventionally adjusted by weather compensator, which results in large fluctuations in the indoor air temperature and high energy consumption of heating. The solutions on current researches mainly focus on heat prediction of demand side, so that the supply temperature can be adjusted according to the predicted heat demand and achieve a heat balance. However, this requires a significant amount of historical data, which limits their applicability. And the lack of pre-simulation platform of the new strategies makes their practical application more difficult. In this paper, a digital twinning of secondary district heating system (DHS) is created, which considers both human behavior and radiator heat dissipation characteristics. A new supply temperature regulate strategy based on indoor temperature feedback is proposed. It contains an indoor temperature prediction model, which require a small amount of measured data and can keep the prediction error within ±0.6 °C. The control effects are analyzed by comparing the proposed regulation strategy with the weather compensator. The result shows that the new temperature regulate strategy is superior to the weather compensator in maintaining indoor temperature and can save energy by 5.4%.",
