Department of Smart City Engineering INHA University Inha-ro 100 Michuhol-gu Incheon 22212 South Korea Handling editor: X Zhao Model-based predictive control (MPC) is an advanced control method that is used to achieve energy and cost savings in building energy management. However, there are various challenges to implementing MPC in actual buildings, such as additional engineering costs, physical damage to systems, and security concerns. This study proposes a non-intrusive implementation method for MPC based on a low-cost communication system. Firstly, a grey-box building model was developed along with the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) models based on the actual measurements of the test building. A simulation case study of MPC was performed, along with baseline feedback control, using these constructed models. The MPC outperformed the feedback control in terms of comfort, electricity consumption, and cost. It was implemented in an actual test zone to demonstrate the feasibility of a low-cost and non-intrusive implementation method that was realized using Arduino-based infrared signal communication and to evaluate the cost-saving potential of the MPC when compared with the baseline control. This experiment was conducted under a confined schedule for occupancy and set-point temperature for three days for the MPC and two days for the baseline feedback control in the cooling season. The cost savings of the MPC are as high as 5.8 %. Additional feedback cases were considered with a non-confined occupancy schedule and set-point temperature. The resulting energy consumption and cost savings are 25.2 % and 33.7 %, respectively. In this study, the applicability of the Arduino-based low-cost and non-intrusive implementation method for MPC was demonstrated, and the actual saving percentage of the MPC was compared with the conventional control method in a real building.

According to the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) announced by South Korea (S. Korea) in 2021, greenhouse gas emissions from the building sector must be reduced by 32.8 % when compared to the emissions in 2018 (52.1 × 106 tons of CO2 eq), reaching a target of 35.0 million tons of CO2 eq by 2030 [1,2]. This is a relatively low target when compared to those set by other major countries, which are in the range of 40%\u201368 % [3\u20139]. The International Energy Agency (IEA) reports that building operations account for 30 % of global final energy consumption and 26 % of global energy-related emissions [10]. Additionally, the UNEP reports that the building and construction sector accounts for approximately 21 % of global greenhouse gas emissions and 34 % of global energy demand [11]. Several studies have reported the excessive energy consumption of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems and their corresponding costs in buildings, emphasizing the need for their reduction [12\u201314]. The IEA reported that space cooling in buildings accounted for approximately 14 % of the peak demand in 2016 [15], which can be attributed to climate change [16]. Furthermore, the cooling load and its peak during the summer exhibited a gradually increasing trend [17] from 2008 to 2016. This peak-related problem raises power management concerns, such as scenarios wherein the power supply capacity does not meet the power demand. Such energy supply problems may cause severe safety issues, such as large-scale blackouts. Typically, passive technologies are used to reduce CO2 emissions. For example, high-performance envelopes, such as smart window systems [18], have been analyzed to reduce building energy consumption. In recent years, renewable energy systems [19], such as solar water heating systems [20,21], have been analyzed as replacements for conventional energy systems. However, the integration and operation of these systems are more significant in maximizing their energy-saving potential, which helps reduce CO2 emissions and address global warming. Model-based predictive control (MPC) is an advanced control method that can be applied to HVAC building operations. It surpasses other control technologies (e.g., classic control, soft control, and hybrid control) in performance metrics such as peak shaving, energy and cost savings, improvement of indoor comfort, and variable control within constraints [22]. MPC is an optimal control method that calculates the optimal input sequences based on the predicted future data. The optimal solutions were derived by considering building models, HVAC system models, time-of-use (TOU) plans, and user-defined constraints. Typically, MPC in the building sector is used to reduce energy consumption and the corresponding electricity costs. In particular, cost savings can be ensured for building owners, residents, and enterprises. Recently, several studies have reported the improved operational performance of MPC through implementation and simulations [23\u201325]. Several studies have reported that MPC can achieve a higher saving rate in terms of energy consumption and electricity costs when comparing MPC, rule-based control (RBC), and feedback controls using simulations and implementations. Joe et al. implemented MPC in a commercial building on campus, where radiant floor systems were used as HVAC systems with a large thermal capacity. It was placed on a concrete floor that was suitable for maximizing pre-cooling. The MPC and feedback control were implemented in a real building using Modbus communication methods based on a grey-box model constructed with actual measurement data. The MPC outperformed feedback control by achieving 27 % lower energy consumption [26]. Bird et al. applied the grey-box model to an MPC study during the heating season. They performed simulations to compare the energy consumption of a commercial building using two control methods: MPC and feedback [27]. They reported 1.7 % lower energy consumption in the case of MPC. Several previous studies have reported a significant reduction in energy consumption and electricity costs when a building has a high thermal capacity (e.g., concrete floor systems) [26,28,29]. Alternatively, energy savings can be realized with MPC when a baseline control, such as RBC or feedback control, is improperly set. For example, Ra et al. implemented both MPC and a conventional control method (baseline case) in factory buildings [30]. The existing control was operated at the full capacity of the condensing unit, which caused overcooling; thus, the air temperature decreased due to the lower comfort limit. The implementation results presented 35.1 % higher energy savings when MPC was used. It is difficult to achieve energy savings via MPC when the room air temperature in the baseline control is properly maintained at the set-point (e.g., the upper bound for the cooling season and the lower bound for the heating season are appropriately set to avoid overcooling and overheating). Shifting the load, which is performed during pre-cooling and pre-heating, results in energy waste. In the cooling case, when the outdoor air temperature was low, the HVAC efficiency was high due to the favorable outdoor environment for condensation. This result was observed when radiant floor cooling in a building with a high thermal mass was performed using an air-to-water heat pump in the MPC [29]. It is difficult to save electricity through pre-cooling and load shifting for typical HVAC systems, such as air systems. Joe analyzed the savings potential of an MPC in a commercial building by performing a simulation study using a simplified grey-box model based on the measured data [31]. The saving percentage of MPC was observed to be approximately 8.6 % when compared with the conventional feedback control, which presents a relatively low saving rate. However, the MPC is still advantageous in terms of the cost savings through load shifting. This finding can be directly applied to the decision-making by building owners or corporations when applying MPC. Furthermore, since MPC utilizes the thermal mass of buildings to shift loads from the on-peak to off-peak periods, it is suitable for governments to manage electricity supply and demand while enhancing system stability [32]. 1.2 Literature review Load shifting presents two advantages: cost savings and the stability of the electricity supply. Governments and individuals primarily benefit from this information. Specifically, from a national perspective, this could contribute to reducing the unit cost of electricity generation and ensuring the safe management of power plants. There are various methods for generating electrical energy, including thermal, nuclear, pumped storage, hydroelectric, and natural-gas methods. The thermal and nuclear power generation methods require a long time to start but are cost-effective; hence, they involve a base load [33]. The pumped-storage hydroelectric and natural gas power generation can be operated instantly; consequently, the unit costs are relatively high, making them suitable for handling peak loads [34]. Therefore, distributing the load helps reduce electricity generation [35]. Furthermore, shifting the load from the on-peak to off-peak conditions can contribute to sustainable planning and management of the plant facilities [36]. Furthermore, this can help in preventing blackouts [37]. From the user's perspective, the utility cost can be reduced by applying a TOU plan. These plans are applied to the electricity costs in South Korea and other major countries to differentiate the costs based on different peak periods. The costs during the on- and off-peak hours vary by a factor of approximately two to three. Thus, users are driven to shift their energy usage from the on-peak to the off-peak period to reduce their utility bill, which includes the energy cost along with the peak demand cost [38]. In this regard, load shifting can contribute to alleviating CO2 emissions while achieving cost savings for governments and individuals and ensuring sustainable electricity generation. The need for demonstrating the implementation of MPC in actual buildings has been emphasized repeatedly; however, most existing studies have been limited to simulations. A few studies have implemented MPC using different communication methods, including Modbus [26], programmable logic controllers (PLC) [30], and BACnet [39\u201341]. Merema implemented MPC in an educational building, wherein demand-controlled ventilation (DCV) was used in the HVAC system. MPC was realized using two modeling approaches: grey-box and autoregressive with exogenous input (ARX) models, using the BACnet communication protocol. The implementation results demonstrated fan electricity savings ranging from 10 % to 40 % and 21 %\u201355 % for heating energy consumption [39]. Yue used BACnet as an MPC implementation method to reduce the energy consumption and related costs of operating HVAC systems in airports. When comparing the daily energy consumption of MPC and RBC, it has been reported that MPC can reduce energy consumption by 24.5 % [40]. Ra et al. implemented MPC in a factory building, where an air-cooled condensing unit (CDU) was used as the HVAC system [30]. MPC was performed using a deep neural network (DNN) model. It was implemented using PLC and direct digital control (DDC) as communication methods. They reported that the energy consumption with the MPC was 35.1 % lower than that achieved using the baseline control method. Recently, TUYA was employed to implement MPC, focusing on reducing cooling costs [42]. They used a cloud server on the TUYA platform for data communication, and the infrared signal was transmitted. The results demonstrated that MPC reduced the operation costs by 22%\u201327 % when compared to the existing control method. Another study employed Raspberry Pi and Arduino-based remote actuation systems [43]. An air-conditioner (AC) remote control was connected to a Raspberry Pi, and the signal was transmitted from the Raspberry Pi to the remote control using an SPI data communication protocol. The results from the MPC implementation demonstrated that the energy consumption was reduced by 8.8%\u201317.5 % when compared to the baseline control methods (e.g., operating at 22 °C and 23 °C). Despite various implementation methods, establishing communication can be challenging due to a variety of security issues. For example, the optimal control results from the MPC must be input into the HVAC system. Typically, an optimized set-point can be overridden in an existing building energy management system (BEMS). However, this has not been realized owing to security issues at the BEMS end (e.g., firewalls), which may lead to potential server problems [44,45]. Furthermore, using a cloud server can cause security issues regarding the data measured from buildings. Additionally, implementing MPC in actual buildings inevitably incurs costs, as emphasized in the last report of the OptiControl project, which is considered a pioneer in MPC for building HVAC operations [46]. Establishing communication with the existing HVAC systems requires customized communication module configurations specific to each manufacturer. Physical alterations and modifications are inevitable in the development of products for customization and may incur costs. Furthermore, additional costs are incurred when setting up the server and communication infrastructure [47]. The existing platforms, such as TUYA, may not be flexible, and additional engineering costs are required to expand or alter the platforms. 1.3 Objectives This study demonstrates the improved control performance of an MPC with actual implementation in an actual building where occupants reside. A non-intrusive implementation method that does not cause physical damage to the HVAC system while maintaining a low cost was demonstrated to overcome the challenges of applying this advanced control scheme to actual buildings. This is a flexible and straightforward method when compared with the existing approaches and can be easily generalized to other types and scales of buildings. A systematic simulation study was conducted to quantify the percentage savings of the MPC in terms of energy and related costs. This was implemented on an actual testbed using the proposed method and compared with experiments that applied a conventional control scheme. Section 2 presents an overview of the overall process, including the building modeling, MPC algorithms, and the MPC implementation method. Section 3 presents a discussion on building modeling based on actual measured data from a testbed building. Section 4 presents the MPC simulation results, including a performance comparison with a baseline case. Section 5 presents the results of the MPC implementation obtained using the demonstration method. Lastly, Sections 6-7 present the conclusions, discussion, and limitations of this study. 2 Methodology 2.1 Research process Fig. 1 depicts the study process. Firstly, a grey-box building and HVAC modeling were conducted using the measured data obtained from an actual test bed. The MPC simulations were performed based on the estimated models to quantify the savings percentage of the MPC when compared with the feedback control, which was considered the baseline. The MPC was then implemented in the testbed zone by applying real-time weather forecasts and temperature measurements. Infrared signal communication was performed using an Arduino board to apply the optimal control signal (e.g., room air temperature set-point) calculated on a computer with a MATLAB environment. 2.2 State-space formulation The grey-box model was constructed in state-space form using variables such as inputs, outputs, and state vectors. This is typically represented by a first-order differential equation, as shown in Equation (1). In this study, x denotes the temperature of the target point in the building, such as the envelope or room air. The input vector, u, includes the outdoor air temperature, lighting heat gain, equipment heat gain, and the cooling rate of the AC. Matrices A, B, C, and D represent the state, input, output, and feed-through matrices, respectively. They comprise the resistance, capacity, and coefficients multiplied by the input variables and are based on the heat balance equation, as shown in Equation (2). T ˙ and C p represent the temperature derivatives corresponding to the time and thermal capacity of the state, respectively. The left-hand side of Equation (2) represents the energy change at each state (node), and the right-hand side represents the heat transfer rate from the adjacent nodes, disturbance input, and control input.

Therefore, the value to be controlled (cooling energy consumption) was extracted separately from the input data and is represented by Equation (4). U U is divided into the disturbance input ( U w ) and control input ( U q ); Ω x , Ω w , and Ω q represent the corresponding matrices.

The minimization of f T · x c is achieved while satisfying the constraints and bounds of the decision variable. (5) f T · x c s . t . a i n e q · x c ≤ b i n e q , l b ≤ x c ≤ u b . 2.4 Infrared signal communication Communication with the HVAC system for the MPC implementation was accomplished through infrared signal communication performed using an Arduino board. This communication is achieved by transmitting specific waveforms, represented in binary form, to the target system. Serial communication was established between MATLAB and Arduino, along with infrared communication between the Arduino and HVAC systems. To transmit the optimal control signal (the set-point temperature of the AC) derived from the MPC to the HVAC system, it is necessary to imitate this signal as an infrared signal. Therefore, the infrared waveforms for different set-point temperatures were identified beforehand. 3 Building and HVAC modeling 3.1 Target building and HVAC system The target building was a campus building located at Inha University in Incheon, South Korea, which was completed in 1954. The building contains six floors; in this study, a single zone located on the fourth floor was considered. Fig. 2 depicts the target building, where the red area represents the target zone from an external perspective. This office space had a volume of 75 m3, floor area of 27 m2, and a ceiling height of 2.75 m. One side of the target zone comprised an external wall with windows, and the remaining surfaces were internal walls adjacent to the corridor and office space. The target building is leaky in terms of airtightness owing to its old window frame, which is vulnerable to outdoor air. However, the external windows face northeast; therefore, less solar radiation is induced, and the considered zone has a small thermal capacity owing to its light building structure and wooden internal furniture. Additionally, this zone has internal heat gain sources such as refrigerators, computers, and lighting. The HVAC system is a direct expansion (DX) cooling coil system with indoor and outdoor units commonly used in South Korea. The rated cooling capacity and coefficient of performance (COP) are 5,200 W and 3.71, respectively. Beyond the rated conditions, the actual performance curve, which varied with the outdoor air temperature, was estimated using the measured data. A total of 3,045 data points were collected over six days during the summer season with only the full capacity, excluding the warm-up period required when starting the unit. Lastly, the COP is shown as a linear function of the outdoor air temperature in Fig. 3 . 3.2 Grey-box building modeling A single zone in the target building was modeled using a grey-box model structure with two states (envelope temperature and indoor air temperature). Fig. 4 depicts the 3R2C model (three thermal resistances and two thermal capacities). The state matrix (A) and input matrix (B) are defined in Equation (6) using the state-space equation presented in Equation (1) and the heat-balance equation presented in Equation (2). A total of 11 estimated parameters are used, which include the thermal resistance, thermal capacity, and coefficients ( R o e , R e r , R r c , C p e n v , C p r o o m , α s o l a r . r o o m , α s o l a r . e n v , α l g t . r o o m , α l g t . e n v , α int . r o o m , α int . e n v ). These are considered to be linear time-invariant (LTI) models, which means they remain constant over time. The fmincon function, a nonlinear optimization solver in MATLAB [49], was employed to optimize these parameters by applying the measured data from the testbed. (6) A = [ − 1 C p e n v ( 1 R o e + 1 R e r ) 1 C p e n v R e r 1 C p r o o m R e r − 1 C p r o o m R e r ] B = [ 1 C p e n v R o e α s o l . e n v C p e n v α l g t , e n v C p e n v 0 α s o l , r o o m C p r o o m α l g t , r o o m C p r o o m 0 α int , e n v C p e n v 0 1 C p r o o m α int , r o o m C p r o o m 1 C p r o o m ] x = [ T e n v T r o o m ] , u = [ T o u t Q s o l Q l g t T c o r Q int Q c o o l i n g ] The grey-box building modeling experiment was conducted for 10 days in July 2023. The indoor experimental data were obtained from the sensors installed within the target zone, including sensors for the indoor air temperature, HVAC system operating time, occupancy schedule, and equipment load, as shown in Fig. 5 . The red areas in Fig. 5 represent the room-temperature sensors. The blue and green areas represent the return and supply temperature sensors, respectively. The outdoor environmental data, including solar radiation and temperature, were obtained from the Korean Meteorological Administration (KMA) [50]. In the modeling process that considered data for 10 days, the data for 7 days were used for estimation, and those for 3 days were used for validation. The model performance was evaluated using the root mean square error (RMSE), as shown in Equation (7). Fig. 6 depicts the measured and predicted indoor air temperatures derived from grey-box modeling, along with the outdoor environmental data. The estimation results demonstrate an RMSE of 0.49 °C; its value during the validation period was 0.50 °C. Both the results demonstrate good prediction performance with a minimum RMSE and a matched trajectory trend. While there is no specific rule or standard for temperature prediction performance in the RMSE evaluation, those values are relatively acceptable considering other studies that achieved around 0.23 °C and 0.63 °C for the 3R2C and 6R5C model structures, respectively [29,51].

Table 1 presents an overview of the TOU plans for various electricity companies in the United States (U.S.) and South Korea. For South Korea, Cases 1 and 2 were divided into the past (Case 1) and current (Case 2) structures. Typically, a cost difference of two to three times is observed between the off-peak and on-peak hours. Fig. 7 depicts the different peak periods. The prediction horizon was 24 h with a time interval of 15 min. The occupancy schedule was set from 08:00 to 18:00, and the comfort bound was set to a range of 20 °C\u201324 °C. The internal heat gain from lighting, equipment, occupants, and so on was set to 892 W, considering three occupants with individual and shared equipment, such as refrigerators and printers. 4.3 Simulations results Using the TOU plan discussed above, the MPC simulations were conducted using the one-day environmental data obtained on August 25, 2023. A feedback-control simulation was performed to quantify the control performance of the MPC. The set-point temperatures were set to the upper comfort bound to evaluate the savings percentage of the MPC in the most conservative manner. Another case with a temperature 1 °C lower than the upper bound was set to consider a more realistic case. Fig. 8 presents the simulation results for the indoor air temperature and power consumption of the AC, along with the outdoor air temperature, solar radiation, and COP. Optimized control was achieved for the MPC by minimizing the electricity costs while maintaining the room air temperature within the comfort bound. Consequently, pre-cooling was observed when the electricity costs were lower. However, feedback control was performed by operating the AC to react with the current room air temperature and follow the set-point temperature without any prediction. Therefore, a comfort violation was observed for approximately 30\u201360 min when the AC was activated upon the initiation of the occupied period. This was calculated by multiplying the deviation between the bound and room air temperatures and then summing for quantification. In the MPC cases, no comfort violations were observed because comfort was set as a hard constraint in the optimization formulation. However, in feedback cases, a comfort violation around 35.6 °C⋅min was observed for both Cases 1 and 2. Table 2 presents a comparison of the electricity consumption and cost between the MPC and feedback-control simulations. The electricity consumption in the MPC case was observed to be 0.99%\u20135.68 % higher than that in Case 1. However, the electricity cost in the MPC case was approximately 6.25%\u201311.31 % lower than that in feedback Case 1. MPC involves pre-cooling by shifting the load from the on-peak to off-peak while minimizing the costs. This demonstrates the cost-saving potential of the MPC. However, the electrical energy of the MPC was not saved when the feedback control perfectly maintained the room air temperature within the upper comfort bound. This comparison can be considered to be the most conservative case for evaluating the MPC control performance. A more realistic case with the temperature set 1 °C lower than the upper bound was also considered. In this case, the MPC exhibited an energy consumption reduction of 4.96%\u20139% and an electricity cost reduction of 15.53%\u201320.39 %. 5 MPC demonstration in actual building 5.1 Configuration of data communication This section describes the demonstration of the MPC in an actual building and presents the corresponding results with a detailed analysis. Real-time MPC and Arduino-based infrared signal communications were employed for implementation. Fig. 9 depicts the implementation process. This involves internet communication between the computation tool (e.g., computer) and weather forecast data, serial communication between the computation tool and Arduino, and infrared communication between the Arduino and AC. Fig. 10 depicts the Arduino board developed in this study for infrared signal communication. The temperature sensor and power meter were wired to an Arduino device and were used for data acquisition and real-time MPC implementation. Their specifications are as follows: the temperature sensor (HDC1080) has an accuracy of ±0.2 °C and the power meter (SCT-013-030) has an accuracy of ±0.1 %. Both the sensors had a sufficient margin of error for indoor temperature and power measurements. Furthermore, this board comprised an infrared signal receiver, infrared signal transmitter, and amplifier. The infrared signal receiver was used to detect the infrared waveform of the target HVAC system, and the infrared signal transmitter was used to transmit the generated infrared signal from the Arduino to the target HVAC system. The amplifier was configured to increase the communication distance between the infrared signals. For infrared signal communication between the Arduino and HVAC systems, it is essential to identify the infrared signal waveform of the target HVAC system. Typically, they exhibit different infrared signal waveforms for each set-point temperature and air volume. Therefore, an experiment was conducted prior to the real-time automatic control by using an infrared signal receiver to identify different infrared signal waveforms. Fig. 11 depicts an example of those with a binary format for three set-point temperatures, including 20 °C, 22 °C, and 24 °C. The green area represents the waveform that controls the air volume, whereas the yellow area represents the waveform of the set-point temperature. The AC operation in this study was performed with a fixed air volume; therefore, only those for the set-point were identified. The AC power consumption was measured in real-time using two power meters installed on a panel board, as shown in Fig. 12 . Among these, the black one is only used for measurement and monitoring and thus was used for AC modeling, as discussed in Section 3.1. The blue power meter can perform real-time data acquisition on the Arduino and was used for MPC implementation. 5.2 Optimization formula for real-time MPC The real-time MPC was conducted using the 3R2C grey-box and AC models, as estimated from the historical data discussed in Section 3. The prediction horizon was 24 h with a time interval of 15 min, during which the optimization was repeated constantly. The comfort bound was set between 20 °C and 24 °C based on the findings of the previous study [56], which is also a reasonable bound for South Korea's weather. Both weather forecasts and real-time temperature data are required to achieve optimal control. The weather forecast data (solar radiation and outdoor temperature) were obtained from a weather website at hourly intervals based on an application programming interface (API), which received the data in the JSON format and was loaded into MATLAB [57]. The data were then resampled from hourly intervals to 15-min intervals. The real-time indoor air temperatures were measured using the temperature sensors connected to an Arduino installed within the zone. Furthermore, the initial state value (temperature) of the unmeasured state (e.g., the envelope) is unknown for each optimization at each time step. Thus, a Kalman filter [58] was applied, as shown in Equations (10)\u2013(14), where Equations (10) and (11) represent the prediction and Equations (12)\u2013(14) correspond to the update phase. (10) x ˆ k − = A d · x ˆ k − 1 + B d · u k (11) P k − = A d · P k · A d ⊤ + Q (12) K k = P k − · H ⊤ · ( H · P k − · H ⊤ + R ) − 1 (13) x ˆ k = x ˆ k − + K k · ( z k − H · x ˆ k − ) (14) P k = P k − − K k · H · P k − X 0 and P 0 represent the initial values of the temperature and error covariance, respectively. A d and B d represent the discrete A and B matrix values of the grey-box model, respectively. x k and z k represent the temperature at the next time interval and the real-time measured temperature, respectively. The temperature data were filtered using a prediction-and-update process. The timer function in MATLAB was used, and MPC was repeated every 15 min [59]. 5.3 MPC implementation and results analysis MPC and feedback control were implemented from August to September 2023. The real-time MPC was implemented for three days (22 Aug, 25 Aug, and 6 Sep), whereas the feedback control was applied for two more days (26 Aug and 4 Sep). The MPC case aimed to minimize the electricity costs while satisfying the constraints for the comfort bound between 20 °C and 24 °C. However, the feedback-control case was conducted at a constant set-point temperature for the occupied period, ranging from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. South Korea's TOU plan was applied to the MPC. This structure divided the cost periods into the off-peak (22:00\u201308:00), mid-peak (08:00\u201311:00, 12:00\u201313:00, and 18:00\u201322:00), and high-peak (11:00\u201312:00 and 13:00\u201318:00) periods. Fig. 13 presents the implementation results of the MPC and feedback control, including the indoor air temperature (T room.imp ), outdoor conditions (T out and Q sol ), and power consumption. Additionally, the simulated room air temperature trajectories (T room.sim ) using the same weather profiles and internal heat gain information were drawn on top of the implementation trajectories to demonstrate the reliability of the MPC implementation results. The implemented trajectories present a trend similar to that of the ideal simulated trajectories, which ensures the fault prediction performance and robustness of the developed building model. In the MPC case, pre-cooling was observed more during the off-peak and mid-peak periods than during the on-peak period, thereby reducing the overall electricity cost. In addition to the cost-saving effects on electricity consumption, no comfort violations were observed over the occupied period. In the feedback control case, the AC was turned on at 8 a.m. when the occupied hours began. After the activation of the AC, the room air temperature did not lie within the bound for approximately 30 min to 1 h. Subsequently, it was able to follow the set-point, which was the upper bound of the comfort range. The comfort violations were quantified similarly to the simulation case study, and the results are summarized in Table 3 . Negligible comfort violations were observed in the MPC case, ranging from 0 to 1.27 °C⋅min. However, significantly higher comfort violations were detected in the feedback case, ranging from 32.06 to 43.6 °C⋅min. Table 4 quantifies the savings percentages of the MPC cases when compared with those of the feedback cases, and the total electricity consumption and costs were compared. The electricity consumption was 1.1 %\u20133.8 % higher in the MPC cases than in the feedback cases. However, the electricity cost was reduced by 2.6%\u20135.8 % in the MPC case. Energy savings were not achieved in the MPC due to the feedback control case with the application of a high set-point temperature, such as the upper comfort bound. Higher energy and cost savings can be achieved by applying a lower set-point for feedback control, as discussed in the simulation study in Section 4. Feedback control with a time-varying set-point (TVS) was also conducted considering a more realistic case, in addition to a conservative evaluation of the MPC with a strict temperature set-point at the upper comfort bound. For this, the set-point was not fixed but was overridden by the occupants, and the occupied period was not confined. Therefore, the range of the AC operation varied from the regular implementation schedule. Additionally, only the data from 08:00 to 18:00 were used for the calculation and evaluation. Table 5 presents a comparison of the electricity consumption and cost between the MPC and feedback control, including the TVS case. In the MPC implementation, electricity consumption and costs were reduced by up to 25.18 % and 33.7 %, respectively, when compared to those achieved using feedback control with the TVS. Fig. 14 depicts the room and outdoor air temperatures for the TVS cases. It can be observed that on some days (Cases 1 and 2), the occupied hours started late, leading to lower cooling energy consumption. However, the set-point temperature was far from the upper comfort bound, leading to overcooling. This effect of the lower set-point offsets the lower cooling energy owing to the delayed working schedule. The other two days (Cases 3 and 4) presented a relatively close occupancy schedule and set-point when compared to the implementation with a confined schedule. However, the electricity consumption and costs are not aligned with these analyses since the weather varies each day. Furthermore, the internal heat gains from the occupants and equipment that were not monitored can vary. 6 Conclusions This study investigated the applicability of an Arduino-based implementation method for MPC in actual buildings. This method can overcome the challenges of applying MPC to real buildings, including additional costs for building the communication module. This can lead to physical damage and an unwillingness for open data communication owing to security risks. To implement the proposed method, a grey-box model was developed using actual measured data obtained from a test bed. Subsequently, a simulation study was conducted to quantify the savings potential of the MPC when compared with feedback control. Lastly, a real-time MPC was applied to the testbed based on infrared communication between the Arduino and HVAC systems by applying weather forecasts and a Kalman filter. \u2022 In the simulation case study, the MPC outperformed feedback control in terms of comfort, energy consumption, and electricity costs. This depends on the TOU structure and set-point of the feedback control. When the set-point of the feedback control was set to the upper comfort bound of the MPC, the cost was reduced by up to 11.31 %, whereas the energy consumption did not decrease. However, higher energy and cost savings were achieved when a lower set-point was applied to the feedback control. \u2022 Comfort violations were rarely observed in the MPC, whereas they were observed in the initial occupied period for the feedback control. This is because the comfort bound was set in the inequality constraint of the optimization formulation of the MPC, whereas the room air temperature was controlled with an error between the current temperature and the set-point without prediction. \u2022 Arduino-based infrared communication was successfully configured and applied to a real-time MPC implementation in an actual testbed. \u2022 In the implementation results, the electricity cost was reduced to 5.843 % in the MPC without energy savings when the confined occupancy schedule and set-point were set for both cases. When these were not strictly applied, energy and cost savings of up to 24.9 % and 33.7 % were achieved, respectively. 7 Limitations and discussion The scope of this study was a single zone. It must be expanded to include multiple zones and buildings. Broader communication methods, such as Wi-Fi, which are typically configured for buildings, can be applied to achieve this. Furthermore, this method presents a longer communication range than infrared communication and enables communication with multiple devices using a server. Along with this communication issue, the computational burden of optimization upon expansion must also be resolved. As discussed in a previous study [26], it is essential to decentralize the optimization formulation while exchanging information among the optimizations in the subsystems. In future works, we will conduct a feasibility study and potential implementation with Wi-Fi-based communication for larger-scale problems while applying a distributed optimization algorithm. In applications for actual control systems, Arduino boards present practical constraints such as sensor accuracy, system setup, and technical complexity. Arduino boards can be considered prototypes with various detachable sensors rather than embedded systems for actual control, which essentially requires stability. Additionally, in future research, we aim to explore not only Arduino boards but also one-board computers, such as the Raspberry Pi, and the development of embedded systems. To enable this, hardware upgrades [60] and the development of a control algorithm based on AI [61] are crucial, as reported in previous studies. A recent study demonstrated an advanced control framework with an upgraded user interface for HVAC operations while applying an AI-based predictive controller [62]. Using infrared communication, the optimal control signals to the HVAC system were transmitted in integer form rather than real numbers. The optimized temperature set-point derived from the MPC formulation at each time step was in real numbers; however, it had to be converted into integers to utilize the infrared signals. Essentially, the control performance was limited to an integer while neglecting more granular results. However, this is an existing issue in typical HVAC systems, which only accept an integer as the set-point. In future studies, this might be resolved with additional engineering to reduce the gap between the optimization and actual behavior of the MPC. The fourth point of discussion concerns the energy-saving potential of the MPC. Based on the simulation study, it is difficult to achieve electrical energy savings for the MPC when we consider an ideal feedback control that closely maintains the room air temperature at the upper comfort bound. When compared to the TVS, where the room-temperature set-point was not strictly maintained at the upper comfort bound, the proposed MPC implementation achieved high energy savings. Furthermore, since the MPC was implemented to achieve cost savings, the results were limited to reductions in electricity expenses. Another significant attribute of these results was the thermal characteristics of the test building. The test building used in this study is old and has a relatively small thermal capacity, with significant infiltration through the windows. When the MPC is implemented in building systems with high thermal capacities, such as radiant systems, high energy and cost savings can be achieved. Future studies must consider additional elements such as energy storage systems (ESS) and renewable energy systems to maximize the energy and cost-saving potential of MPC. This study does not consider demand charges since the utility plan for demand charges is not identical to that of the US, which directly penalizes to the peak point of the month to promote relief and distribution of the flocking energy usage. In future works, this can be considered a target for reducing the application of the objective function or inequality constraint. This can be implemented using a distributed optimization strategy, considering the case of reducing the peaks of multiple buildings or communities. The reproducibility of the methodology proposed in this study can significantly contribute to this research field. The original coding for MATLAB and Arduino is presented in Ref. [63]. This includes the coding of the loaded weather forecast data, transmitting infrared signals to the AC, and the infrared waveform of the target AC.

        "dc:description": "Model-based predictive control (MPC) is an advanced control method that is used to achieve energy and cost savings in building energy management. However, there are various challenges to implementing MPC in actual buildings, such as additional engineering costs, physical damage to systems, and security concerns. This study proposes a non-intrusive implementation method for MPC based on a low-cost communication system. Firstly, a grey-box building model was developed along with the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) models based on the actual measurements of the test building. A simulation case study of MPC was performed, along with baseline feedback control, using these constructed models. The MPC outperformed the feedback control in terms of comfort, electricity consumption, and cost. It was implemented in an actual test zone to demonstrate the feasibility of a low-cost and non-intrusive implementation method that was realized using Arduino-based infrared signal communication and to evaluate the cost-saving potential of the MPC when compared with the baseline control. This experiment was conducted under a confined schedule for occupancy and set-point temperature for three days for the MPC and two days for the baseline feedback control in the cooling season. The cost savings of the MPC are as high as 5.8 %. Additional feedback cases were considered with a non-confined occupancy schedule and set-point temperature. The resulting energy consumption and cost savings are 25.2 % and 33.7 %, respectively. In this study, the applicability of the Arduino-based low-cost and non-intrusive implementation method for MPC was demonstrated, and the actual saving percentage of the MPC was compared with the conventional control method in a real building.",
