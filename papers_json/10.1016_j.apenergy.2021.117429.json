Graphical abstract Precise and quick thermal load prediction for buildings is imperative in realizing the flexibility of building energy systems. Operation optimization based on the prediction results can effectively mitigate the energy consumption and operation cost. Here, an artificial neural network (ANN) model is built to predict the load demand and energy consumption of an office building. Thermal zones division is considered to improve the prediction accuracy. Measured data are collected to establish and validate the ANN model. The total number of samples for training, validation and testing are 13674, 3978 and 3977, respectively.

In order to ensure the sustainable development of China nation economy and achieve the goal of peaking CO2 emissions before 2030 as well as realizing carbon neutrality before 2060, it is necessary to take measures to conserve energy and reduce carbon emissions. According to the statistical results provided by the International Energy Agency (IEA), buildings account for 36% of global energy consumption [1], while more than 50% of building energy is consumed by heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems. Furthermore, around 39% of greenhouse gas emissions are produced by buildings. Considering that HVAC systems are the major energy consumers in buildings, the operation optimization is helpful to improve the flexibility of building energy and save the operation cost. In order to mitigate the building energy consumption and operation cost, it is necessary to predict the load demand and energy consumption of buildings accurately and quickly [2]. Artificial intelligence is taken as a powerful prediction method [3]. Artificial intelligent regression models such as regression trees, artificial neural network (ANN) model and adaptive neuro-fuzzy have been widely used for prediction in engineering fields [4]. With the development of sensor technology, building automation systems (BAS) can be adopted to monitor and manage HVAC systems [5]. On the one hand, the operation data of HVAC systems collected by BAS can be utilized to establish the building energy database, which provides data for the model training of artificial intelligence algorithms. On the other hand, BAS can manage HVAC systems in real time, which provides technical support for the operation optimization of HVAC systems. As the hotspot of buildings, the conservation of building energy and operation cost attracts attention from scholars across the globe and a number of relevant researches have been carried out. 1.2 Literature review Prediction modeling methods are mainly divided into three categories, which are white box model, grey box model and black box model [6]. White box model uses the theory formula to build relationship between the load demand and various impact factors, which takes long time to calculate. Typical white box model includes building energy simulation software, such as EnergyPlus, TRNSYS and ESP-r [7]. Grey box model usually adopts model identification, and undetermined coefficients in the formula are identified by historical data. Typical grey box model includes resistance-capacitance model [8]. Black box model learns the rules of load demand through a considerable number of historical data, and maps the relationship between inputs and outputs without explaining mechanisms inside [9]. Typical black box model includes artificial neural network model [10] and support vector machine model [11]. Considering that the prediction of load demand and energy consumption is a complex nonlinear problem, it takes much time to establish white box model. Hence, black box model of ANN is widely investigated for load prediction. Predicting the load demand and energy consumption is beneficial to realize the match between supply side and demand side of HVAC systems [12]. Many scholars have established prediction models of HVAC systems with machine learning algorithms while the reasonable selection of inputs is crucial to improve the prediction accuracy. Various inputs are required to involve comprehensive information and improve prediction accuracy of the model. It is worth noting that too many inputs may exacerbate the complexity and training time of the model, so it is important to determine the appropriate inputs by correlation analysis such as Pearson correlation coefficient and Spelman correlation coefficient [13]. Biswas et al. [14] took outdoor temperature and solar radiation as inputs, and established ANN model based on Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to predict the building energy consumption with the coefficient of determination (R2) as high as 0.878. Li et al. [15] used back-propagation ANN model to predict building cooling load demand with outdoor temperature, outdoor relative humidity and solar radiation as inputs. The mean relative error (MRE) of the model was 2.024%. Sholahudin et al. [16] found that the outdoor temperature and wind speed were the most important meteorological parameters to ANN model. However, only considering meteorological parameters as inputs of ANN model could not involve all the impact factors of building energy consumption and load demand. Ding et al. [17] studied impacts of various inputs on prediction accuracy of office building cooling load demand by K-means and hierarchical clustering method, and found that the supply and return chilled water temperature of previous one hour had great impacts on prediction accuracy. Nasruddin et al. [18] selected cooling set-points as well as supply airflow rate as inputs to predict the building energy consumption and the root mean squared error (RMSE) of ANN model was 0.3. In addition to the above impact factors, the uncertainty of occupant behavior also impacts the prediction accuracy of the model [19]. Wang et al. [20] studied impacts of occupant behavior on prediction accuracy of the heating energy consumption. The results proved that occupant behavior could increase the coefficient of variation of root mean squared error (CV-RMSE) from 13.12% to 36.74%. Occupant rate is an important character which represents the ratio of occupied rooms compared to the total number of rooms at a certain time. The presence and energy-use behavior of occupants in the rooms impact the energy consumption of HVAC systems. Occupant rate is an important indicator of occupant behavior. Taking occupant rate as an input can improve the prediction accuracy of ANN model. Song et al. [21] demonstrated that taking the occupant rate as an input could improve the prediction accuracy of the model. They established the occupant rate prediction model and combined ANN model to predict the building energy consumption, and the CV-RMSE of ANN model was 26%. Deng et al. [22] combined ANN model with EnergyPlus to simulate occupant behavior and predict the building energy consumption, the MRE was less than 13%. According to the above literature, scholars mainly focused on the occupant rate, while seldom considered the impact of personalized thermal comfort differences on the load demand and energy consumption. The variation of occupant thermal comfort demands lead to different indoor temperature. Rooms with similar indoor temperature can be divided into a single thermal zone and a building is comprised of multiple thermal zones. Thermal zones division is important to investigate the impact of occupant behavior on prediction accuracy. Furthermore, thermal zones division has a strong impact on the energy consumption and energy flexibility of a building [23]. However, existing researches usually assume the same indoor temperature for all the rooms in a building without considering thermal zones division, which is detrimental to the prediction accuracy. Therefore, it is imperative to establish a zone-level ANN model with high prediction accuracy for the load demand and energy consumption. The optimization of HVAC system operation based on ANN prediction model is necessary. The combination of ANN model with optimization control model can improve the energy system performance, and provide preferable optimization results compared with the classic proportional integral controller [24]. Many studies were carried out to optimize various control variables of HVAC systems. Chaudhuri et al. [25] optimized the operation frequency of HVAC equipment with ANN model combined with greedy search algorithm and saved energy consumption by 36.5%. Moon et al. [26] introduced ANN model into model predictive control algorithm to schedule the heating set-points of a variable refrigerant flow heating system and realized the cost saving of 7.93%. Lee et al. [27] optimized the supply air temperature of air handling units (AHU) in real time with ANN model and the results showed that the energy consumption of AHUs could be reduced by 10% when the supply air temperature was 17 °C. Ferreira et al. [28] applied radial basis ANN model combined with discrete branch and bound approach to optimize the operation of HVAC systems, and the energy saving was greater than 50%. In addition to the above optimization methods, the following studies combined ANN model with genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize the HVAC system operation and the energy conservation potential varied according to the control variables. Lee et al. [29] optimized the airflow rate of an air-to-air heat pump and the annual energy consumption could decrease by approximate 30% in the heating season. Magnier et al. [30] optimized the indoor relative humidity as well as thermostat delays, and reduced energy consumption by 13%. Reynolds et al. [8] optimized the indoor temperature in the time of use (TOU) electricity price scenario, the optimization model could precool or preheat the building to take advantage of the building thermal mass and saved operation cost by 27%. Furthermore, rule-based control is a widely used optimization method in HVAC systems. Rule-based control model is established based on a series of \u201cif-then\u201d rules defined by experienced building managers. Saloux et al. [31] developed a rule-based control strategy to control the flow rate of a solar heating system with thermal energy storage, and reduced operation cost by 43%. Jokisalo et al. [32] established the rule-based control algorithm for a heat pump coupled with a thermal storage tank system, and conserved operation cost by 15%. Rule-based control is practical and effective in the HVAC system with thermal storage tank, and it is adopted in this study. From the literature review above, it is important to predict the load demand and energy consumption of the HVAC system with high accuracy. ANN model has edge in self-learning and generalization ability, and it is predominant in nonlinear function fitting. Furthermore, ANN model can help to investigate impacts of occupant behavior on the load demand and energy consumption with thermal zones division. ANN model is a powerful method to address the uncertain factors for prediction [33]. Therefore, ANN model is adopted in this study for accurate prediction. Furthermore, optimization of HVAC system operation based on ANN prediction model is promising to reduce the energy consumption and operation cost of buildings. 1.3 Problem description This study dedicates to establish a practical methodology for operation cost conservation and energy flexibility improvement of buildings. However, occupant behavior increases the difficulty for the prediction of load demand and energy consumption, which is detrimental to operation cost mitigation and indoor thermal comfort. Furthermore, it is necessary to propose an effective optimization method to improve the HVAC system performance based on the ANN prediction results. On the basis of the above problems, this study combines a zone-level ANN model with rule-based control model to provide appropriate operation strategies for the HVAC system. The results of this study help to improve the HVAC system performance. Furthermore, this study offers practical methods for HVAC engineers and building managers to operate HVAC systems efficiently and economically. The approach framework is presented in Fig. 1 . 2 Zone-level ANN model 2.1 Descriptions of the building and HVAC system An office building located in Tianjin, China is selected as the study case. The building has five floors with the height of 19.2 m. The total conditioned space is 2852 m2 while the heat transfer coefficients of exterior walls, windows and roofs are 0.3 W/(m2·K), 2.3 W/(m2·K) and 0.46 W/(m2·K), respectively. The geometry of the office building is presented in Fig. 2 (a). The BAS is employed in the case building to monitor the HVAC system operation since 2015. Monitoring values include indoor temperature, inlet and outlet temperature of heat pumps at ground source side and demand side, water flow rate at ground source side and demand side, electricity consumption of heat pumps and circulating pumps, cooling/heating capacity supplied by heat pumps, etc. Temperature recorders are installed at workspaces, rest areas, waiting rooms, corridors and lobbies of the building. Photographs of typical thermal zones are shown in Fig. 2 (b). Occupants can adjust the air-conditioner in their workspace according to their personalized thermal comfort demand. The building is equipped with two ground source heat pumps combined with a thermal storage tank to provide cooling and heating for the air-conditioning area. The schematic of the HVAC system is shown in Fig. 3 . The nominal cooling and heating capacity of the heat pump are 88 kW and 72 kW, respectively. The volume of the thermal storage tank is 40 m3 and the maximal storage capacity (SCAP max) is 2.88 × 106 kJ. Furthermore, the maximal charging rate (u c,max) in summer and winter is 176 kW and 144 kW while the maximal discharging rate (u d,max) is 150 kW. The TOU electricity price of Tianjin in different periods is shown in Table 1 . The pattern of electricity price represents the grid demands for improving the efficiency of electric power utilization, while the peak shaving and valley filling at user side can play a major role. The thermal storage tank is helpful to shift HVAC load from the on-peak period to off-peak period, which responses to the demand of power grid. Furthermore, the thermal storage tank brings energy flexibility for the office building and building managers can operate the energy system in low electricity price period, which improves economic performance of the system. Operating the heat pumps and thermal storage tank with appropriate control strategies is promising to activate demand response and energy flexibility of the office building [34]. 2.2 Principle and structure of ANN model Precise and rapid prediction is beneficial to realize the match between supply side and demand side of the HVAC system. Considering complex relationships between inputs and outputs, ANN model is introduced to solve the nonlinear fitting problem. As a black box model with strong self-learning ability, ANN model is predominant in predicting with high accuracy and fast computation speed. Compared with white box model which requires laborious model construction and detailed parameters setting, ANN model greatly simplifies the modeling process. Furthermore, white box model usually adopts fixed operation schedules of HVAC systems which increases prediction error. While ANN model has edge in predicting load demand and energy consumption based on actual occupant behavior in the office building. ANN model costs less computation time than white box model and it is suitable for optimization control in a real scenario. Regard to the model development, MATLAB toolbox is used to train and test ANN model. ANN model is comprised of neurons to mimic the working mechanism of a human brain. As the basic elements of ANN model, the transfer of signals relies on the working of neurons. Schematic of a single neuron is shown in Fig. 4 , it can be seen as an information processing unit with several inputs and one output. All the inputs x j are summed up by weight w and added with bias b, then converted to output y by the transfer function f. The formula of neuron output is shown as follows: (1) y = f ( ∑ j = 1 n w j x j + b ) Hyperbolic tangent sigmoid and pure linear transfer function are used for hidden layer and output layer neurons, respectively. Hyperbolic tangent sigmoid function is continuously differentiable and it converts inputs from [−∞, +∞] to [−1, 1]. The inputs and outputs of pure linear function are equivalent. Pure linear function enables ANN model to output any values. Expressions of hyperbolic tangent sigmoid function and pure linear function are shown as follows [18]: (2) f ( z ) = 1 - e - 2 z 1 + e - 2 z (3) f ( z ) = z Structure of ANN model includes input layer, hidden layer and output layer. The number of neurons at input layer and output layer is determined by the number of inputs and outputs, respectively. While the number of neurons at hidden layer needs to be adjusted repeatedly to achieve the highest model accuracy. Input signal transports from input layer to hidden layer, and then to output layer. The parallel computation of multiple neurons greatly enhances the information processing ability and adaptive ability of ANN model, which makes it possible to solve nonlinear problems. 2.3 Inputs and outputs of ANN model Inputs are crucial to improve the prediction accuracy and they should be diverse to contain information as much as possible. Based on literature review, meteorological parameters, HVAC system operation parameters, occupant behavior parameters are most commonly used [35]. Inputs should meet the requirements of strong correlation with outputs, as well as easy-measured [36]. With the support of the monitoring platform, inputs of ANN model in this study are as follows: outdoor temperature, indoor temperature of thermal zones, temperature difference between inlet and outlet at ground source side of ground source heat pumps, occupancy status. It is worth noting that the indoor temperature of thermal zones indicates thermal comfort preferences of occupants in different zones. As for occupancy status, 1 represents the workspace is occupied while 0 means that there are no occupants. The outputs of ANN model are the load demand and energy consumption of the HVAC system. It is worth noting that the cooling/heating load demand is represented by cooling/heating capacity supplied by heat pumps. The hourly cooling/heating capacity can be obtained by the heat meter and the energy consumption of heat pumps is obtained by the electric meter. All the monitoring data are collected and counted by BAS. Overall, eight inputs and two outputs are adopted for ANN model. Considering that the objectives of ANN model are to predict hourly load demand and energy consumption in the next 24 h, the hourly inputs for the next day should be available [8]. Weather parameters are available from weather station with good accuracy. While indoor temperature [37], temperature difference between the inlet and outlet at ground source side of ground source heat pumps [38] can be achieved by ANN prediction, respectively. Furthermore, prediction of occupancy status is obtained according to statistic results of the last three years. The features of inputs and outputs are summarized in Table 2 . 2.4 Parameters of ANN model Hyperparameters of ANN model mainly includes: number of hidden layers, number of hidden neurons and learning rate etc. Single hidden layer feedforward ANN model is adopted in this study. According to the inputs and outputs, the number of neurons at input and output layer are defined as eight and two, respectively. With respect to hidden neurons, the method of trial and error is recommended [39]. Training results indicate that ANN model has the highest accuracy when the number of hidden neurons is 10. Structure of ANN model is shown in Fig. 5 . Learning rate determines the variation magnitude of weights in training epoch. High learning rate may lead to vibration during the training which is detrimental to the stability of ANN model, while low learning rate results in slow convergence rate and long training time. Similar to hidden neurons, the learning rate requires repeated training to obtain a proper value. Learning rate of 0.3 is adopted after training and comparison. In addition to hyperparameters and transfer functions described above, training parameters are set as follows: the maximum epoch is 1000, performance function is mean squared error (MSE), the training performance goal is 10-3, training function is trainlm and the maximum validation failures are 6. It is worth noting that the trainlm function updates weight and bias values according to Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation algorithm [6]. The characteristics of the developed ANN model are summarized in Table 3 . 2.5 Training of ANN model Hourly data measured by a BAS of the office building from the year of 2017 to 2018 are collected to train ANN model while the data of 2019 are used to validate and test the model. Considering that the dimensions of different kinds of data are diverse, the dataset should be normalized between 0 and 1 to improve the accuracy and convergence rate [40]. The formula is as follows: (4) x \u2032 = x - min ( x ) max ( x ) - min ( x ) where x\u2019 is the normalized value, x is the original value. It is worth noting that overfitting is one of the common problems which occurs during the training process of ANN model. Overfitting means that ANN model shows high prediction accuracy for training samples, while the accuracy declines significantly when it comes to new data samples. ANN model with the overfitting problem shows weak generalization ability which is detrimental for its utilization in new situations. Cross validation is adopted to evaluate the performance of ANN model and solve the overfitting problem. The data samples are divided into three groups for training, validation and testing. Training samples are used to update the weight and bias values based on gradient descent. Validation samples are used to prevent the overfitting problem. The prediction errors for training samples and validation samples decrease simultaneously at the initial stage of ANN model training. However, the error for validation samples increases once the overfitting problem occurs while the error for training samples still decreases. The training process will stop when the error for validation rises to a specific number of times, and the weight and bias values are reserved for ANN model. Eventually, testing samples are used to test the prediction accuracy of the ANN model, and the structure and hyperparameters of the ANN model can be adjusted to improve the prediction accuracy. Building monitoring data from the year of 2017 and 2018 are used for training while data from the year of 2019 are used for validation and testing. The parameters for training, validation and testing data include: outdoor temperature, indoor temperature of different thermal zones, temperature difference at ground source side of heat pumps, occupant status, cooling/heating capacity supplied by heat pumps and energy consumption of heat pumps. Considering the contingency of data collection, the abnormal and vacancy values should be eliminated from data samples before model training, then data samples can be normalized by Eq. (4). After data preprocessing, the number of samples for training, validation and testing are 13674, 3978 and 3977, respectively. Training process of ANN model is adjusting the weight and bias constantly to minimize the error between the output and target. MSE is used as the performance function and the training goal of MSE is less than 10-3. The formula of MSE is shown as follows: (5) MSE = 1 m ∑ i = 1 m ( p i - t i ) 2 where m is the number of data samples, p is the prediction value, t represent the measured data, and subscript i is the i th sample. Convergence process of ANN model is shown in Fig. 6 . Five statistical indices are introduced to evaluate the prediction accuracy of ANN model comprehensively, which are R2, RMSE, CV-RMSE, expected error percentage (EEP) and mean absolute error (MAE). The five indices are as follows: (6) R 2 = 1 - ∑ i = 1 m ( p i - t i ) 2 ∑ i = 1 m ( p i - t i ) 2 + ∑ i = 1 m ( t i - t ¯ ) 2 (7) RMSE = ∑ i = 1 m ( p i - t i ) 2 m (8) CV - R M S E = RMSE t ¯ (9) EEP = RMSE max ( t i ) (10) MAE = 1 m ∑ i = 1 m p i - t i where t ¯ is the mean value of the measured data. Monitored data in 2019 are used to test the predication accuracy of ANN model and results are listed in Table 4 . In view of evaluation results, the R2 indicates that the inputs contain enough information for prediction [41]. CV-RMSEs for heat pump energy consumption and load demand are 10.76% and 15.59%, respectively. According to the requirement of ASHRAE Guideline 14 [42], the CV-RMSE should below 30% and ANN model in this study meets the standard well. Furthermore, calculation results of RMSE, EEP and MAE also show that ANN model can predict the heat pump energy consumption and load demand in high accuracy. To be intuitive, comparisons between the predicted and measured values are conducted in the typical days from January 7th to 20th in winter and July 1st to 14th in summer. Results are shown in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8 . It can be observed that the predicted values are in good agreement with the measured data. Furthermore, the accuracy of heat pump energy consumption prediction is higher than the load demand. It can be attributed to the energy consumption of heat pump is relative stable during the operation while the load demand fluctuates greatly. 3 Rule-based control optimization model To improve the efficiency and economic performance of the HVAC system, it is necessary to optimize its operation. An optimization model is established, which can provide appropriate operation strategies based on the prediction results of ANN model. Operation cost of the heat pumps is taken as the objective function, which is as follows [43]: (11) J = min ( ∑ k = 1 24 α k × E k ) where J is the objective function, α is the electricity price, E is the heat pump energy consumption, and subscript k is the k th hour of a workday. Decision variables include the stored energy SE total, charging rate of heat pumps u c,k, discharging rate of the thermal storage tank u d,k, and the cooling/heating capacity supplied by heat pumps h k. It is worth noting that the charging rate represents the energy delivered from heat pumps to the thermal storage tank, and the discharging rate represents the energy delivered from the thermal storage tank to the HVAC terminal equipment. Range of the decision variables are presented in Table 5 . To ensure stable operation of the thermal storage tank and feasibility of operation strategy, corresponding constraint conditions are given as follows: (12) 0 ⩽ u c,k ⩽ u c,max (13) 0 ⩽ u d,k ⩽ u d,max (14) ∑ k = 9 24 u d,k ⩽ S E total (15) u d,k + h k = Q k where Q is the load demand. It is worth noting that the load demand is predicted based on personalized thermal comfort needs of occupants, and it is assumed that satisfying the load demand leads to acceptable thermal comfort [44]. In general, four types of operation control strategies are commonly used for the thermal storage tank, which are chiller priority control, constant proportion control, storage priority control and rule-based control [45]. Compared with the former three control strategies, rule-based control can conserve operation cost by 30% in the TOU electricity price scenario [46]. Rule-based control makes full use of ANN prediction results to guarantee the match between supply side and demand side of the HVAC system. Furthermore, building managers can predefine operation rules based on their professional knowledge and requirements. Rule-based control facilitates building energy flexibility and improves economic performance of the system. Therefore, rule-based control is adopted to maximize the use of the thermal storage tank and reduce operation cost considering the electricity price policy of Tianjin. Control principle of optimization model in the off-peak period is shown as follows: (16) S E total = SCA P max i f S C A P max < Q total Q total i f S C A P max > Q total (17) u c,k = u c,max i f S E total - S E k ⩾ u c,max ( S E total - S E k ) i f 0 < S E total - S E k < u c,max 0 i f S E k = S E total Based on the predicted load demand, heat pump charges the thermal storage tank to reach SE total with the charging rate of u c,k, to match the supply side and demand side. Optimization procedure in the off-peak period is shown in Fig. 9 . As for the on-peak and flat period, the hourly COP of heat pump is calculated based on prediction results of ANN model. The thermal storage tank has priority to release energy when the COP is low and make full use of the heat pump to supply cooling/heating when the COP is high. The heat pump COP in the on-peak and flat period is labeled with n = 1, 2···8 according to the order of COP ascending, where n = 1 corresponds to the hours with the lowest COP while n = 8 is on the contrary. Control principle of optimization model in the on-peak and flat period is shown as follows: (18) u d,n = u d,max i f u d,max < Q n and S E n ⩾ u d,max Q n i f u d,max > Q n and S E n ⩾ Q n S E n i f 0 < S E n < u d,max or 0 < S E n < Q n 0 i f S E n = 0 Optimization procedure in the on-peak and flat period is shown in Fig. 10 . 4 Results and discussion In this section, the proposed zone-level ANN model is applied to predict the load demand and energy consumption of the HVAC system. Rule-based control model is adopted to optimize the HVAC system operation based on the prediction results. The effects of thermal zones division are investigated. Furthermore, the load pattern of representative days is analyzed and compared. Based on the prediction results, rule-based control optimization is implemented in the HVAC system operation. 4.1 Effects of thermal zones division on prediction accuracy Comparison of ANN models with and without thermal zones division is shown in Table 6 . By considering thermal zones division, the R2 for energy consumption and load demand is improved from 0.89 to 0.99 and from 0.91 to 0.97, while the CV-RMSEs decrease by 12.94% and 13.62%, respectively. Other evaluation indices also indicate the improvement for the prediction accuracy. It is worth noting that the inputs for ANN1 and ANN2 are different. The inputs for ANN1 are the indoor temperature of five thermal zones. While only indoor temperature of thermal zone 1 is used as the input of ANN2 to represent the whole office building. Apart from these, ANN1 and ANN2 share the same number of outputs, number of hidden layers, number of hidden neurons, learning rate, transfer function and training function. The detailed information can be found in Table 3. For further comparison, regression results of two ANN models are illustrated in Fig. 11 and Fig. 12 , respectively. It is obvious that the fitting degree of ANN model with thermal zones division is higher, and the distribution of predicted values is more concentrated and even. Conversely, regression results of ANN model without thermal zones division are dispersive and messy. Hence, considering thermal zones division is significant to improve the prediction accuracy. 4.2 Load pattern of representative days The maximal load days and part load days are picked for analysis and optimization according to load prediction results of ANN model. Load pattern of the maximal load days is shown in Fig. 13 . It indicates that the cooling load demand increases first and then decreases with the variation of outdoor dry-bulb temperature and solar irradiance. While the heating load demand presents the opposite trend. Furthermore, occupant behavior leads to the fluctuation of load pattern. The load demand maintains at high level in most of the on-peak as well as flat period, and the maximal load demand in summer is greater than that in winter. The long operation time of heat pumps in the on-peak period results in high operation cost although working at high load ratio can benefit the heat pump unit efficiency. Load shifting with the thermal storage tank from the on-peak period to off-peak period is essential. Load pattern of the part load days is shown in Fig. 14 . Compared with the maximal load days, the load demand level decreases by approximate 50% in the part load days. The thermal storage tank can undertake most of the load demand in the part load days which brings considerable economic benefits. Hence, it is crucial to shift the load in the on-peak and flat period to improve the heat pump performance and cut down the cost during the part load days. 4.3 Optimization of representative days In the TOU electricity price scenario, the heat pump system without thermal storage tank is taken as the baseline and the cost saving of the optimized operation strategy with thermal storage tank is analyzed. Based on the prediction results of ANN model, the optimization model is applied to improve the operation strategy in the maximal load days. The optimized load distribution as well as comparison between the optimization and baseline for heat pump energy consumption is shown in Fig. 15 . It can be observed that the heat pump charges the thermal storage tank to reach SCAP max in the off-peak period. All the stored energy discharges in the on-peak period while the load demand in the flat period is met by heat pumps due to the high load requirement during the on-peak period. It is worth noting that the thermal storage tank releases energy in 22:00\u201323:00 rather than in 21:00\u201322:00 due to the lower COP in 22:00\u201323:00 as presented in Fig. 15 (a). Comparison between the optimization results and baseline during the maximal load days is listed in Table 7 . The cost saving in the maximal load days of winter and summer reaches to 36.32% and 37.03% respectively, which indicates that the optimization model realizes the peak-load shifting and reduces the operation cost significantly. It should be noted that the optimized operation cost in the summer off-peak period is lower than that in the winter due to the higher COP of cooling. Furthermore, the cost saving in the winter on-peak period is lower than that in the summer due to the higher load demand during the on-peak period. Hence, it is challenging for the thermal storage tank to fully cut down the operation cost of heat pumps in the maximal load days of winter. Similarly, optimization is conducted in the part load days, and the load distribution as well as comparison between the optimization results and baseline for heat pump energy consumption is illustrated in Fig. 16 . The heat pump charges energy in the thermal storage tank during the off-peak period as the same in the maximal load days. Furthermore, there is energy left to release in the flat period owing to the reduction of load demand in the part load days. The energy stored in the thermal storage tank can cover most of the load demand, and the energy consumption of heat pumps is mitigated greatly in the on-peak as well as flat period. Comparison between the optimization results and baseline during the part load days is listed in Table 8 . The cost saving in the part load days of winter and summer reaches to 48.18% and 45.79% respectively, which shows greater cost reduction than the maximal load days. It can be attributed to the optimization model not only eliminates the operation cost in the on-peak period but also mitigates the cost in the flat period. The thermal storage tank is fully utilized and activates the building energy flexibility to shift load, and the cost saving potential is considerable due to heat pumps operate at the part load ratio rather than maximal load ratio in most of the time. 4.4 Optimization of the heating and cooling season Load pattern in the heating and cooling season is presented in Fig. 17 . Tianjin locates in the cold zone of China and the accumulated heating load is higher than cooling load. The optimization model is adopted to analyze the annual economic benefits. Comparison between the optimization results and baseline during the heating and cooling season is listed in Table 9 . The cost saving in the heating and cooling season are 39.22% and 44.41%, respectively. The optimized operation cost of heat pumps in the flat period is higher than that in the on-peak period due to the longer operation time. Furthermore, considering the high-level heating load demand, the cost saving potential in the heating season can be further exploited by expanding the capacity of the thermal storage tank. 5 Conclusions In this study, a zone-level ANN model is established and combined with the optimization model to predict the load demand and optimize the operation strategy. The main findings are summarized as follows: (1) Accuracy of ANN model is improved by considering thermal zones division. The R2 for energy consumption and load demand is improved from 0.89 to 0.99 and from 0.91 to 0.97, while the CV-RMSEs decrease by 12.94% and 13.62%, respectively. Furthermore, the accuracy of the proposed ANN model meets the requirement of ASHRAE Guideline 14. (2) The cost saving in the maximal load days of winter and summer are 36.32% and 37.03%, respectively. The optimized operation cost in the off-peak period of summer is lower than that of winter due to the higher system efficiency of cooling. Furthermore, it is challenging to mitigate the operation cost in the maximal load day of winter due to the higher heating load demand during the on-peak period. (3) The cost saving in the part load days of winter and summer are 48.18% and 45.79%, respectively. The cost saving in the part load days is greater than that in the maximal load days since the stored energy can cover most of the load demand during the part load days. Furthermore, the energy consumption of heat pump is greatly reduced. (4) The optimization model activates the flexibility of building energy and reduces the operation cost. The cost saving potential in the heating and cooling season are 39.22% and 44.41%, respectively. It is helpful for the optimization of HVAC system operation.

        "dc:description": "Precise and quick thermal load prediction for buildings is imperative in realizing the flexibility of building energy systems. Operation optimization based on the prediction results can effectively mitigate the energy consumption and operation cost. Here, an artificial neural network (ANN) model is built to predict the load demand and energy consumption of an office building. Thermal zones division is considered to improve the prediction accuracy. Measured data are collected to establish and validate the ANN model. The total number of samples for training, validation and testing are 13674, 3978 and 3977, respectively. A rule-based control optimization model is introduced and combined with ANN model to optimize the operation of heating, ventilation and air-conditioning system. Building energy flexibility is activated by optimization model in a time-of-use electricity price scenario. The results indicate that ANN model has high precision and the coefficient of variation of root mean squared errors corresponding to the load demand prediction and energy consumption prediction are 10.76% and 15.59%, respectively. Furthermore, the optimization results can reduce the operation cost by 39.22% and 44.41% in the heating and cooling season, respectively.",
