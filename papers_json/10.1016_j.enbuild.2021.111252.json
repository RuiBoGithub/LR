School of Information Science and Engineering Wuhan University of Science and Technology Wuhan 430081 China Demand response is an important way to improve buildings energy consumption.It aims to schedule the various appliances in the buildings to let their energy consumption match the real-time electricity price provided by smart grid. Based on buildings energy management systems, a DR scheduling algorithm is presented for buildings economic energy consumption. It defines the user target price to indicate different user requirements and learns the working time of the appliances for the residents' comfort in the buildings by logistic regression. Thus, the presented algorithm dynamically adjusts the maximum power threshold, and then automatically arranges the operation of the appliances to achieve buildings economic energy consumption. Simulation results show that the presented algorithm can significantly reduce the energy consumption demand during peak price period while ensuring the residents\u2019 comfort, and the total energy cost can be reduced by 15.1% compared with the user's expectation. © 2021 Elsevier Science.

Controlling buildings energy consumption plays an important role in reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and mitigating climate change. Demand response (DR) is an important way to improve buildings energy consumption. It aims to schedule the various appliances in the buildings to let their energy consumption match the real-time electricity price provided by smart grid to achieve peak shaving, which in turn saves buildings energy costs and ensures the stability of power grid [3\u20136]. Fig. 1 is a schematic diagram of the real-time buildings energy management system (RBEMS) for residential buildings, in which the core part is the RBEMS controller. DR scheduling algorithm runs on the controller and distributes limited energy between appliances based on energy consumption data, user target price (UTP), and real-time electricity prices from power grid utility. It controls the working status of all appliances in the buildings by adapting the start and end times of appliances in response to variable electricity prices or to avoid a peak demand in power grid. Many studies perform DR scheduling to reduce peak demand and the electricity bill [7\u201310]. However, the operations of appliances in buildings controlled by DR scheduling may not always be convenient for residents. Despite possible energy and money savings, new operations can heavily interfere with residents\u2019 comfort (such as HVAC operation) or convenience. The residents\u2019 comfort is implicit in two aspects. One is the residents\u2019 energy consumption patterns indicated by their historical energy consumption data. The other is the willingness to pay for energy costs. The former reflects how and when the buildings operate the appliances to better meet the residents' comfort. The latter reflects the affordability of energy costs for residents with various demands for comfort. Integrated the above two aspects that may affect residents' comfort, the working period of the appliances can be better scheduled by DR, to ensure residents\u2019 comfort as well as save energy costs. To address this issue, a DR scheduling algorithm is presented in this paper. Two features make this algorithm distinct from the existing DR algorithms. 1. The comfortable working time (CWT) model is introduced to the DR scheduling algorithm. In CWT model, residents\u2019 energy consumption patterns on each appliance are learned by logistic regression based on historical energy consumption data. The learning results classify the schedulable appliances into two categories: strong flexibility and weak flexibility. The schedulable appliance with strong flexibility can be scheduled by DR algorithm in a broader range of working time compared with that of weak flexibility. This broad working time range of the schedulable appliance is named as CWT in this paper, which flexibly operates appliances to meet the residents\u2019 comfort. 2. The UTP is defined to indicate the residents\u2019 affordability of energy costs. The maximum power threshold (MPT) at the current moment could be calculated by RBEMS based on the UTP set by the user and the real-time price provided by the power grid utility, which is used as a scheduling criterion for the DR scheduling algorithm. If the total energy required in the current time slot is greater than the MPT, the schedulable appliance with strong flexibility will be scheduled to its next available CWT slot. Thus, the DR scheduling algorithm could dynamically adjust the state of the appliances in response to the variation of the RTP. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews related work and motivates our research, and Section 3 introduces the DR scheduling model. Section 4 introduces the proposed DR scheduling algorithm.This is followed by simulation studies in Section 5.Finally, section 6 concludes the paper. 2 Related work and motivation This section first reviews the methods by which DR scheduling realizes buildings economic energy consumption. Then, the goals for the controlling of energy consumption in buildings are elaborated. Finally, the motivation for our research is summarized. 2.1 Methods for the design of DR scheduling Currently, DR scheduling in RBEMS focuses on how and when to operate the appliances according to the real-time pricing because the current smart grid can collect real-time energy consumption data from customers and provide RTP information to them with the help of Internet of Things [11]. The main methods for the design of DR scheduling are broadly divided into three categories: (i) mixed-integer linear programming (MILP); (ii) intelligent algorithms; (iii) machine learning. MILP is mainly used to schedule the appliances to operate during low price hours, thus minimizing the monthly energy costs [12]. To consider the variable power of schedulable appliances and the number of appliances in the buildings, minimum cost maximum power is also a scheduling criterion under residents\u2019 electricity bill target [13,14]. Machine learning algorithms are often used to get the priorities of various appliances in buildings depending on the characteristics of their energy consumption. Then, the appliances are scheduled to operate according to their priorities. For example, the appliance\u2019s regular working time is learned by Naïve Bayes classifier, then the appliances are scheduled according to the priorities of their working time [15]. A flexible load priority list is designed by a neural network, then the appliances are scheduled according to the load priorities [16]. Intelligent algorithms such as genetic algorithms and particle swarm are often used to optimize the peak energy consumption in buildings, thus minimizing the energy cost. By optimizing the size and switch-on priority of a multi-source energy plant in a commercial building with the genetic algorithm, the primary energy consumption is minimized [17]. By optimizing the peak energy consumption with genetic algorithm and particle swarm algorithm, the electricity cost and user discomfort are minimized [18]. By optimizing user waiting time with a genetic algorithm, the electricity cost and peak to average ratio are minimized [19]. 2.2 Goals for DR scheduling in RBEMS The goals of most DR scheduling in RBEMS are to reduce energy costs and peak to average ratio. Accordingly, DR scheduling generally reschedules the appliances from peak hours to valley hours. Such scheduling may reduce energy costs, but residents\u2019 comfort also gets disturbed. Although most research is towards energy saving, maintaining a balance between residents\u2019 comfort and energy consumption is drawing more and more attention. Comfort index is becoming a goal to consider in DR scheduling algorithm. It is generally represented by various forms such as thermal comfort, visual comfort, air quality comfort, and so on. Accordingly, those various comfort indexes are often taken as constraints to minimize energy consumption in DR scheduling algorithm. 2.3 Motivation Most of the existing literature only utilizes the variation of price to operate appliances and then save energy costs. Such operations don\u2019t take into account the residents\u2019 willingness to pay for energy costs. Different residents have different consumption demands, for example, some residents hope for a lower cost, while others hope to pay more for a comfortable life. This motivates our research on DR scheduling algorithm considering residents\u2019 comfort. The residents\u2019 comfort can also be reflected by their energy consumption patterns on the appliances in a building. Identifying those energy consumption patterns with machine learning to ensure the working time of the appliances can better meet the residents\u2019 comfort. At present, the classification and priorities of the appliances in a building have been studied based on the working characteristics of the appliance. Generally, in real life, high priorities are given to those non-schedulable appliances, and the energy requirements of those non-schedulable appliances must be met first. Schedulable appliances occupy a large part of the buildings appliances, and the working time of the schedulable appliances will have a great impact on the residents\u2019 comfort. Therefore, it is particularly important to schedule the working time of the schedulable appliances for the residents\u2019 comfort. This paper concentrates on how to obtain the CWT for each schedulable appliance automatically. 3 DR scheduling model According to the working characteristics of the appliance, the appliances in a building are broadly classified into the following two categories: \u2022 Non-schedulable appliances (NSAs) have the rigid load requirement that must be satisfied during energy distribution.These appliances typically need to be turned on at all times, RBEMS doesn't have to learn their CWT or schedule them. The representative NSAs are security systems, temperaturesensors, fire alarms, ambient light sensors and so on. \u2022 Schedulable appliances (SAs) also have energy demands.However, if the demand for these appliances cannot be met (as it is currently peak price time), these appliances will be preempted (i.e. shut down) and operation will be rescheduled until energy prices fall. The targets of DR scheduling are as follows: \u2022 Learn the residents\u2019 energy consumption patterns to ensure their comfort. \u2022 Control the real-time energy cost according to the user\u2019s budget to reduce electricity bills. \u2022 Reduce the peak demand. To fulfill these targets, a DR scheduling model considering UTP and CWT is proposed for the RBEMS. Fig. 2 shows the flow diagram of the DR scheduling model. There are two core parts in this scheduling model. The left part denotes the process of learning CWT. Residents\u2019 energy consumption patterns on each appliance are learned by logistic regression based on historical energy consumption data. The learning results are CWTs of the schedulable appliances, and they are used as the input of the DR scheduling. The right part denotes the process of DR scheduling. Table 1 and Table 2 are respectively the inputs and outputs of DR scheduling. One day is divided into 1440 time slots in minutes in the proposed model. UTP, along with RTP, allows RBEMS to calculate the amount of available energy. The usage data collected from each appliance will be provided to RBEMS in the future as historical energy consumption data as well. 3.1 User target price (UTP) The users can set a specified monthly budget for energy consumption to RBEMS based on their requirements. If the user wishes a higher comfort level, he will pay more. The monthly budget can be converted to an hourly user target price UT P hourly or a daily user target price UT P daily by RBEMS. MPT can be achieved by monthly budget and RTP. It represents the available energy of one month. Because RTP can provide hourly and day-ahead price data, the maximum power threshold can be divided into hourly maximum power threshold (HMPT) and daily maximum power threshold (DMPT). They will be used as a scheduling criterion for the DR scheduling algorithm. (1) HDE = UT P hourly RT P hourly ( k W h ) (2) HMPT = HDE 1 h = UT P hourly RT P hourly · 1 h ( k W ) HDE is the hourly available energy. HMPT is calculated by Eqs. (1) and (2). (3) DDE = UT P daily RT P daily ( k W h ) (4) DMPT = DDE 24 h = UT P daily RT P daily · 24 h ( k W ) DDE is the daily available energy. DMPT is calculated by Eqs. (3) and (4). 3.2 Molding comfortable working time (CWT) of schedulable appliances To meet the residents\u2019 energy consumption patterns, it is necessary to get the CWT of schedulable appliances. The CWT of schedulable appliances can be determined based on residents\u2019 comfort thresholds and residents\u2019 energy consumption patterns. The residents\u2019 energy consumption patterns can be reflected by historical energy consumption data. Their previous weekly and daily appliance usage data imply their energy consumption preferences. The logistic regression algorithm uses the historical energy consumption data to get the probability that the schedulable appliance can be started in each time slot. Then the final CWT can be calculated according to the comfort threshold α ( 0 < α < 1 ) set by the user. RBEMS could give a default threshold for each schedulable appliance. If the user requires more comfort ( α approaches 1), the CWT range of the schedulable appliance will be narrower. On the contrary, if the user requires less comfort ( α approaches 0), the CWT range of the schedulable appliance will be broader. Users can set different α for weekdays and weekends. The nomenclatures used in CWT module are shown in the Nomenclature before the Introduction. The training data of the CW T i of the schedulable appliance S A i is derived from the user's historical electricity consumption information and electricity consumption time, as shown in Table 3 . EC D i is the set of the electricity consumption data of the S A i , its dimension is N × 3 , each piece of electricity consumption data EC D j i as shown in Eq. (5). The schedulable appliance state SA S j i is a variable of 0\u20131, where 1 represents appliance start-up and 0 represents appliance shut-down; the day of week DO W j i is a variable of 1\u20137, represent Monday to Sunday respectively; and the minute of day MO D j i represents the collection time of the electricity record, and the collection frequency is once a minute, divided by 24 h, and the value range of MO D j i is [1,1440]. The schedulable appliance state SA S j i is the classification attribute and DO W j i , MO D j i is the feature attribute. For example, the data of (1, 485, 0) in Table 3 means that the state of the appliance was off at minute 485 (which is 8:05 a.m.) on Monday, and the data of (3, 715, 1) means that the state of the appliance was on at minute 715 (which is 11:55 a.m.) on Wednesday. The data in Table 3 are only examples and the SAS here only refers to the state of the appliance at the current moment and does not indicate that the appliance turns on or shuts down at that moment. (5) EC D j i = ( D O W j i , M O D j i , S A S j i ) , 1 ⩽ i ⩽ n , 1 ⩽ j ⩽ N (6) SA F j i = 1 DO W j i MO D j i ( D O W j i ) 2 DO W j i · M O D j i ( M O D j i ) 2 ⋮ DO W j i · ( M O D j i ) l - 1 ( M O D j i ) l To ensure the accuracy of training, the number of feature attributes should be appropriately increased by mapping [20]. If the number of mapping layers is l, then the schedulable appliance feature property SA F j i is shown in Eq. (6). Its dimension is m × 1 , where m = ( l + 1 ) ( l + 2 ) 2 . In the logistic regression model, the sigmoid function, as shown in Eq. (7), is needed to establish likelihood estimation function and classify data. In this paper, the probability of SA S j i = 1 could be represented by sigmoid function, as shown in Eq. (8). The regression coefficient θ i = θ 0 i , θ 1 i , ⋯ , θ m i , its dimension is m × 1 . (7) S ( x ) = 1 1 + e - x = e x 1 + e x (8) P S A j i _ o n = e θ iT S A F j i 1 + e θ iT S A F j i The regression coefficient θ i can be calculated by maximum likelihood estimation, the likelihood estimation function is shown in Eq. (9). Based on the idea of maximum likelihood estimation, maximizing Eq. (9) is equivalent to maximizing its logarithm, as shown in Eq. (10). (9) L ( θ i ) = ∏ j = 1 N P S A j i _ o n SA S j i 1 - P S A j i _ o n ( 1 - S A S j i ) = ∏ j = 1 N e θ iT S A F j i 1 + e θ iT S A F j i SA S j i 1 - e θ iT S A F j i 1 + e θ iT S A F j i ( 1 - S A S j i ) (10) l ( θ i ) = ln L ( θ i ) = ∑ j = 1 N [ S A S j i θ iT S A F j i + ln ( 1 - e θ iT S A F j i 1 + e θ iT S A F j i ) ] Take the partial derivative of Eq. (10) with respect to θ i , and set it equal to 0, like Eq. (11). (11) l \u2032 ( θ i ) = ∂ l ( θ i ) ∂ θ i = ∑ j = 1 N ( S A S j i - e θ iT S A F j i 1 + e θ iT S A F j i ) S A F j i = 0 The result of Eq. (11) is the regression coefficient θ i . Take the partial derivative of Eq. (10) with respect to θ i , and set it equal to 0, like Eq. (11). (11) l \u2032 ( θ i ) = ∂ l ( θ i ) ∂ θ i = ∑ j = 1 N ( S A S j i - e θ iT S A F j i 1 + e θ iT S A F j i ) S A F j i = 0 The result of Eq. (11) is the regression coefficient θ i . For the predicted data P D k i = ( D O W k i , M O D k i ) to be tested, the probability P S A k \u2032i _ o n can be calculated by Eq. (12) using sigmoid function. (12) P S A k \u2032i _ o n = e θ iT S A F k \u2032i 1 + e θ iT S A F k \u2032i If P S A k \u2032i _ o n > α , the time slot of item k is considered to be the CW T i of the S A i . The CW T i of the S A i could be expressed as Eq. (13). The S A i would request to open when time reaches to its CW T i where the P D k i = ( D O W k i , M O D k i ) and α is the comfort threshold. (13) CW T i = { P D k i P S A k \u2032i _ o n > α } Because this learning process uses historical data, the whole process can be done offline, with a weekly learning cycle. The CWT data of all the schedulable appliances are eventually aggregated into a CWT table. According to the regular running time of the appliances and the CWT obtained through logistic regression learning, the schedulable appliances can be divided into strong flexible schedulable appliances (SFSAs) and weak flexible schedulable appliances (WFSAs). \u2022 The CWT range of SFSAs is generally longer than twice its regular running time. Because the regular running time of the appliances meet this condition can be adjusted to a broader range. For example, users may use the washing machine from 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. on Monday, or from 4:00p.m. to 6:00p.m . on Wednesday. \u2022 The CWT range of WFSAs is less than twice its regular running time. This type of appliance includes two working situations: running for a long time a day or running in fixed time slots. Because WFSAs have a narrow adjustable range of running times, DR algorithm will distribute the available energy to WFSAs at first. Different user's energy consumption patterns will bring about the results of the classification for schedulable appliances. 4 DR scheduling algorithm The flowchart of the DR scheduling algorithm which is proposed in this paper is shown in Fig. 3 . It summarizes the main steps of the algorithm. Step 1 is the pre-processing of the data. The HMPT and CWT tables of SAs are derived from the DR scheduling model and the calculation process can be carried out offline. Step 2 is loop scheduling. Since the non-schedulable appliances are always on, the total power of the appliances with on state (include non-schedulable appliances and schedulable appliances that could be turned on at time t) at time t can be calculated by Eq. (14).Whether the next cycle is to be carried out is determined by comparing the magnitude of the value of P t over with that of HMPT. In order to minimize the number of appliances being shut down, we should look for the SFSA with the closest power to P t over . If P t over is greater than the power of all SFSA that can be turned on at time t, the SFSA with the highest power will be canceled to open and entering the next judgment until the requirements are met. (14) P t sum = ∑ a = 1 A P _ N S A a + ∑ b = 1 B P _ S A t b Since SFSA has a broader range of scheduling, compared with WFSA, it is more comfortable for users to cancel the opening of SFSA in case of P t sum > H M P T . If there is an extreme case that shutting down all the SFSA still doesn\u2019t meet the requirements, it will be considered to shut down WFSA to meet the requirements. However, in real life, there are a large number of SFSA, so the above situation does not occur. 5 Simulation analysis In this section, we developed the scheduling model for RBEMS using MATLAB. Our goal in conducting this simulation was to determine the relative advantages of the proposed DR scheduling algorithm by comparing the performance of a building property using DR with HMPT with that of one using DR with DMPT, and one using peak shaving.The method used here for peak shaving is to first calculate the average electricity consumption for the day based on previous historical data and then to use the average consumption as a threshold value to control the state of the appliances in a building during the current time slot to achieve a balanced distribution of energy. We design three kinds of simulations to verify the validity of the proposed DR scheduling algorithm. \u2022 By using historical data of washing machine and electric vehicle (EV), the effectiveness of CWT model of the proposed DR scheduling algorithm is testified. \u2022 With a small number of appliances, the role of HMPT in the proposed DR scheduling algorithm is observed. \u2022 With a large number of appliances, the effectiveness of DR scheduling algorithm is investigated. 5.1 The CWT of schedulable appliances simulation Based on the historical energy consumption data in the past 5 weeks, the CWT of schedulable appliances is learned from the CWT model of the proposed DR scheduling algorithm. The usage data of schedulable appliance washing machine and EV over the past 5 weeks is shown in the three-dimensional diagrams Fig. 4 (a) and Fig. 5 (a).The \u201chour of day\u201d on the vertical axis corresponds to the MOD in section 3.2. To facilitate observation, the unit is changed from minute to hour. The vertical bar is the range of time slots during which the appliance is turned on for the past 5 weeks. After training with logistic regression in the proposed DR scheduling algorithm, a decision boundary can be obtained. The range within the decision boundary is the CWT of the schedulable appliances. The vertical bars in Fig. 4(b) and Fig. 5(b) show the training results for the CWT of the washing machine and EV in the current week. The residents have different energy consumption patterns on each day of the week. If the same working time is set for schedulable appliances on each day, the residents\u2019 comfort will be affected. For example, the CWT of the washing machine on Tuesday is different from the CWT on Wednesday (as shown in Fig. 4(b)). The training results show that the CWT of the washing machine each day is significantly more than 4 h, which is two times more than its working time (2 h). The CWT of the EV is basically within 6 h, which is less than two times the charging time of the EV (3 h). Accordingly, the appliances in Fig. 4(b) and Fig. 5(b) are SFSA and WFSA, respectively. After training, the CWT of the schedulable appliance is measured in a minute instead of an hour or half an hour. This prevents a large number of appliances from requesting to start up at the beginning of the same hour slot, causing dramatically increasing in the energy load. 5.2 Simulation of eight appliances In this section, simulation scenarios are described firstly. Then the simulation performance criteria are given. Finally, the simulation results are analyzed. 5.2.1 Simulation scenarios To better comprehend the DR scheduling algorithm proposed in this paper, we chose 8 appliances that are commonly used in any building. Because there are fewer NSAs that need to be worked for 24 h a day in real life, the eight appliances consist of 2 NSAs and 6 SAs. Table 4 lists the information of 8 appliances used for this simulation. The RTP data which corresponds to March 3, 2020, is provided by the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) power company [21], as shown in Fig. 6 . The green bars and red bars represent two different price ranges: low-price periods and high-price periods. Table 5 lists the other parameters used in this simulation.Each schedulable appliance can be set with a different α . The values of these parameters depend on the user\u2019s settings.For comparison, the comfort threshold α of all schedulable appliances is fixed at 0.5. According to the hourly pricing and day-ahead pricing data provided by the PJM power market and the UTP, the range of HMPT and the value of DMPT can be calculated by Eqs. (1)\u2013(4). We have HMP T min = HDE 1 h = UT P hourly max ( R T P hourly ) · ( 1 h ) ( k W ) = 0.2 ( d o l l a r / d a y ) / 24 ( h ) 32.22 ( d o l l a r / m W h ) · 1 ( h ) = 0.258 ( k W ) = 258 ( W ) HMP T max = HDE 1 h = UT P hourly min ( R T P hourly ) · ( 1 h ) ( k W ) = 0.2 ( d o l l a r / d a y ) / 24 ( h ) 14.51 ( d o l l a r / m W h ) · 1 ( h ) = 0.574 ( k W ) = 574 ( W ) and DMPT = HDE 1 h = UT P hourly RT P daily · ( 1 h ) ( k W ) = 0.2 ( d o l l a r / d a y ) / 24 ( h ) 18.86 ( d o l l a r / m W h ) · 1 ( h ) = 0.441 ( k W ) = 441 ( W ) 5.2.2 Performance criteria In this section, we will describe three criteria for analyzing algorithm performance: peak average ratio (PAR) [22], total energy cost, and average comfort distance (ACD). PAR indicates the ratio of the peak load demand and the total daily average load demand, from t = 1 to t = 1440, as shown in Eq. (15). PAR describes the energy consumption changing tendency of the buildings. The smaller the PAR is, the flatter the change of energy demand is. The reduction of PAR is essentially to reduce the peak-valley difference. (15) PAR = max ( P t on ) 1 T ∑ t = 1 T P t on The total energy cost is calculated by Eq. (16), where the RTP is the hourly price. Because the schedulable appliances are scheduled in minutes, cost calculation requires to be accurate to the minute. Reducing the energy cost is one of the purposes of RBEMS. (16) Cost = ∑ t = 1 1440 P t sum × R T P × 1 60 ACD is calculated by Eq. (17). By comparing ACD, we can know the difference between the working time obtained by the proposed DR scheduling algorithm and the historical working time. The smaller the ACD is, the closer the working time is to the real working time. Thus, ACD can indirectly reflect residents\u2019 comfort. (17) ACD = 1 n × ∑ i = 1 n ∑ h = 1 W H i t h predict - t h true W H i 5.2.3 Simulation results This section illustrates the simulation results and evaluates the performance of the proposed DR scheduling algorithm in HMPT and DMPT situations, where the peak shaving situation is used as a benchmark. Fig. 7 shows the CWT of six schedulable appliances obtained by the residents' historical energy consumption data of the past 5 weeks. Among them, appliance 3, 4 and 5 belong to WFSA, and appliance 6, 7 and 8 belong to SFSAs. Fig. 8 shows the comparison of energy consumption on March 3, 2020, with the three scheduling algorithms. The solid line indicates the fluctuation of energy consumption of DR with HMPT. When the time reaches 8:00 a.m., the decreasing of RTP leads to the rising of HMPT. The energy that can be distributed per time slot increases, and the energy requests for more appliances can be satisfied, so the total energy consumption at 8:00 a.m. rises. When RTP increases to the peak at 6:00p.m., HMPT decreases dramatically. Thus, some schedulable appliances have to be shut down due to insufficient energy. Furthermore, when the time reaches 7:00p.m., the schedulable appliances being shut down previously are turned on as RTP decreases gradually. The thick dash line indicates the fluctuation of energy consumption of DR with DMPT. The dot line indicates the fluctuation of energy consumption of peak shaving. As can be seen from Fig. 8, between 6:00p.m. and 7:00p.m. (peak price period), the total energy consumption of DR with DMPT and peak shaving is still higher than that of DR with HMPT. Since HMPT varied with hourly RTP compared with the other two scheduling algorithms, the energy consumption fluctuations of DR with HMPT were sensitive to the changes in electricity prices. In addition, since the CWT of the SAs is also considered in the case of DR with DMPT, the energy consumption change curve of DR with DMPT coincides with that of DR with HMPT most of the time. Fig. 9 compares the energy cost of the three scheduling algorithms in each hour on March 3, 2020. As we can see from the Fig. 9, the energy cost of the DR with HMPT and DR with DMPT is higher than the situation of peak shaving in the period of low-price, meanwhile, in the period of high-price, the energy cost of the DR with HMPT is significantly lower than the other two situations, indicating that the DR with HMPT scheduling algorithm can balance the working time of appliances among CWT slots, thus achieve the purpose of cutting peak. Fig. 10 is the comparison diagramof three scheduling algorithms in performance PAR and maximum power at peak price period. It should be noted here that peak shaving algorithm is scheduled following the principle of balancing the total energy in each time slot, so the PAR of peak shaving must be smaller than the other two scheduling algorithms. The PAR of DR with HMPT is slightly higher than that of DR with DMPT under the same maximum P t sum . However, RBEMS more care about the total energy consumption at the peak price period due to the higher cost. DR with HMPT can significantly reduce the total energy consumption at the peak price period, to reduce the cost at the peak price period. The total energy consumption at the peak price period of DR with HMPT is reduced in exchange for a little rising PAR of DR with HMPT. Fig. 11 is the performance comparison of the three scheduling algorithms, in which energy cost is the total cost of the day in the simulation. As can be seen from the data in Fig. 11, the ACD of DR with HMPT and DMPT is far less than that of peak shaving because CWT is introduced in those two scheduling algorithms. The ACD of DR with HMPT is slightly larger than that of DR with DMPT because the starting request of schedulable appliances is delayed in the period of high electricity price (6:00p.m.) as shown in Fig. 8. However, the total energy cost of DR with HMPT was lower than that of DR with DMPT, which saved 35.1% of the daily budget. 5.3 Simulation of more appliances As there are generally more than eight appliances in a building, we considered expanding the number of simulated appliances to better simulate real-life situations. To better reflect the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, we also consider extending the duration of scheduling in the simulation. A total of 100 appliances were selected for this simulation and the duration of scheduling in the simulation is extended from 1 day to 3 days. 5.3.1 Simulation scenarios The simulation for 8-appliances in Section 5.2 is more to display the computational process of CWT and UTP as well as the scheduling process of the DR scheduling algorithm.However, the ultimate target of the proposed algorithm is to schedule the operation of all appliances in a building, and the number of appliances in a typical household must be much more than 8. So we increased the number of appliances to 100 (such as villas and manors). Considering that only a small number of appliances in a general building are Non-schedulable appliances that need to be kept on all the time, we set the number of Non-schedulable appliances to 10 and schedulable appliances to 90. Table 6 shows information of a selected key number of the 100 appliances used for this simulation. The pricing data from March 3, 2020, to March 5, 2020, was provided by the PJM power company.The price varied considerably during this period allows us to more clearly analyze the performance of the proposed algorithm. Table 7 lists the other parameters used in this simulation.Each schedulable appliance can be set with a different α . The values of these parameters depend on the user\u2019s settings.For comparison, the comfort threshold α of all schedulable appliances is fixed at 0.5. According to the hourly pricing and day-ahead pricing data provided by PJM power market and the UTP, the range of HMPT and the value of DMPT from March 3, 2020 to March 5, 2020 can be determined. 5.3.2 Simulation results This section illustrates the simulation results and evaluates the performance of the DR scheduling algorithm in HMPT and DMPT situations, where the peak shaving situation is used as a benchmark. Fig. 12 shows the comparison of energy consumption on March 3, 2020, to March 5, 2020, with the three scheduling algorithms.The solid line indicates the fluctuation of energy consumption of DR with HMPT.The thick dash line indicates the fluctuation of energy consumption of DR with DMPT.The dot line indicates the fluctuation of energy consumption of peak shaving. In general, the energy consumption of peak shaving and DR with DMPT did not respond to the price fluctuations.Ascan be seen from Fig. 12 that the energy consumption of DR with HMPT is significantly reduced in the three peak price periods (the period of 18, 42 and 55), and more schedulable appliances are scheduled in some low-price periods (such as the period of 23\u201327, the period of 59\u201365, etc.).Since DR with HMPT can constantly adjust the working time of the schedulable appliances with price fluctuations, it can minimize energy consumption during peak price periods and transfer them to low-price periods to avoid higher costs. Fig. 13 shows the comparison of energy consumption on March 3, 2020, to March 5, 2020, with the three scheduling algorithms.The scheduling algorithm of DR with HMPT reduced the energy consumption of peak price period compared with the other two situations and achieves the purpose of reducing the energy load of a building at the peak price period. Fig. 14 is the comparison diagram of three scheduling algorithms in performance PAR and maximum power at peak price period from March 3, 2020, to March 5, 2020.The maximum power at peak price period of DR with HMPT in each day is far less than the other two scheduling algorithms.Consistently, the scheduling algorithm of DR with HMPT can significantly reduce the energy consumption in the peak price period which we mentioned in the examples with eight appliances. Fig. 15 is the performancecomparison of the four algorithms. The scheme used in Ref. [15], which also considers user comfort, is added to performance comparisons. In Fig. 15, the ACDs of the first three algorithms considering the residents\u2019 comfort are far less than that of peak shaving.However, the ACDs of DR with HMPT and DMPT are less than that of the scheme in Ref. [15]. The reason is that the scheme in Ref.[15] schedules appliances according to the priority of discrete time window (DTW) while DR with HMPT and DMPT schedules appliances according to the available energy in each time slot. The differences for the total energy cost of four scheduling algorithms are very small. The total energy cost using DR with HMPT is the lowest because the more schedulable appliances are arranged to the low price time slots. Compared with the examples with eight appliances, the ACD of DR with HMPT in this section is superior to that of DR with DMPT due to the increase in the number of appliances.In other words, the scheduling algorithm of DR with HMPT is more suitable for buildings with a large number of schedulable appliances.In addition, the total energy cost of DR with HMPT was the lowest, which saved 15.1% of the UTP (2.2 dollars/day). From the simulation results, the following conclusions are summed up: 1. The scheduling algorithm of DR with HMPT could automatically arrange the operations of the appliances in a building following the energy consumption patterns and requirements of different residents, enabling load shifting from high-price periods to low-price periods while ensuring the residents\u2019 comfort. 2. While the scheduling algorithm of DR with HMPT is more costly in low-price periods, the total energy consumption and cost at peak times are significantly reduced, as shown in Fig. 12 and Fig. 13.The cost savings during high-price periods compensate for the additional costs during low-price periods, and the overall energy costs can be reduced over the long term using the DR with HMPT. 3. The scheduling algorithm of DR with HMPT is more suitable for buildings with a large number of schedulable appliances. 6 Conclusion In this paper, we propose a DR scheduling algorithm of the economic energy consumption in buildings. We introduced UTP as an indicator to satisfy the requirements of different residents and dynamically adjust MPT based on the RTP provided by the power grid utility. In the meanwhile, considering the relationship between residents\u2019 energy consumption patterns and their comfort, CWT of the schedulable appliances is learned based on the historical energy consumption data. The DR scheduling algorithm proposed in this paper automatically arranges the working time of the schedulable appliance according to UTP and CWT of the schedulable appliances. Compared with the traditional peak shaving DR algorithm, the proposed DR scheduling algorithm could significantly reduce the electricity demand in high-price periods because it can balance the working time of appliances among CWT slots, resulting in better economic energy consumption in buildings. Compared with the scheme used in Ref. [15], the proposed DR scheduling algorithm could have a shorter ACD because it schedules appliances according to the available energy in each CWT time slot instead of priority, resulting in better residents\u2019 comfort. Therefore, simulation results show that the proposed DR scheduling algorithm could significantly reduce the energy demand in high-price periods while ensuring user comfort and realize an overall energy cost reduction through load shifting. In future work, we are going to find a proper way to quantify the residents\u2019 comforts based on the CWT module in the proposed DR scheduling algorithm. In addition, an extension of the proposed DR algorithm for multi-family units and commercial buildings will be studied furtherly.

Based on buildings energy management systems, a DR scheduling algorithm is presented for buildings economic energy consumption. It defines the user target price to indicate different user requirements and learns the working time of the appliances for the residents' comfort in the buildings by logistic regression. Thus, the presented algorithm dynamically adjusts the maximum power threshold, and then automatically arranges the operation of the appliances to achieve buildings economic energy consumption.
