The development of the building energy management systems (BEMS) enable users to intelligently control Heating, Ventilation, Air-conditioning and Cooling (HVAC) systems based on digital information. In order to reduce the power consumption cost of the HVAC system while ensuring user satisfaction, a novel HVAC control system for building system based on a multi-step predictive deep reinforcement learning (MSP-DRL) algorithm is proposed in this paper. In the proposed method, the outdoor ambient temperature is predicted first by a featured deep learning method named GC-LSTM, where the Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) is enhanced by the generalized correntropy (GC) loss function to deal with the non-Gaussian characteristics of the collected outdoor temperature. In addition, the proposed temperature prediction model is combined with a reinforcement learning algorithm named Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) aiming to flexibly adjust the output power of the HVAC system under the dynamic changing of electricity prices. Finally, comprehensive simulation based on real world data is delivered. Numerical results show that the GC-LSTM algorithm is more accurate than other counterparts prediction algorithms, and the proposed HVAC control system based on the multi-step prediction deep reinforcement learning algorithm is effective and could save over 12% cost compared to other approaches, where the user comfort is maintained simultaneously.

To mitigate the impact of the growing demand and shape a low carbon energy future, more intelligent strategies are needed to improve building energy efficiency [1]. In building energy management system (BEMS), the users electricity consumption habits and distributed renewable energy directly lead to power peak and valley, which may cause serious impacts on the power grid [2,3]. In recent years, with the development of smart grids and the implementation of the demand response (DR) strategy, residential users have changed from passive power consumers to active participants in power consumption [4,5]. The electricity price and power generation information are bidirectionally exchanged with user demand information [6]. In BEMS, the power consumption of the HVAC system accounts for about 35% of the power consumption of all equipment [7]. Therefore, under the circumstance of satisfying users comfort to a certain degree, the output of the HVAC system should be intelligently controlled according to the grid electricity price and environmental temperature information power, which is of great significance for reducing the power consumption of the HVAC system and reducing user costs. The HVAC systems usually adopt traditional control methods: on-off rule, closed-loop control and model predictive control algorithms [8\u201310]. In the system implementation, temperature sensors are designed inside the on-off rule or closed-loop control system. When the HVAC system detects that the indoor temperature reaches a set value, it will stop to reduce the operational cost. The HVAC system based on closed-loop control or on-off rule has a simple structure and is easy to implement. However, in the environment of smart grid and DR strategy, it is difficult to intelligently adjust the power output of the HVAC system according to the dynamic electricity price to meet the standards of energy saving and emission reduction. To solve this problem, Ferreira et al. [11] proposed a model predictive control algorithm to control the HVAC system by establishing an indoor temperature change model. Turhan et al. [12] proposed a thermal comfort driven control algorithm to improve HVAC control systems with no need of retrofitting HVAC system components. The use of existing HVAC systems in buildings has attracted increasing attentions to implement continuous DR in providing frequency regulation service, which enhances instantaneous power balance and reliability of power grids without extra huge investment. Wang et al. [13] proposed a hierarchical optimal control strategy, consisting of a regulation bidding controller and a power use following controller. It optimizes power usage baseline and regulation capability considering trade-offs between economic return (regulation capability) and thermal comfort while meeting HVAC system operating constraints. However, it is often intractable to accurately establish an indoor ambient temperature changes model, which is seriously affected by a variety of factors [14,15]. With the development of intelligent algorithms, particle swarm optimization (PSO) and genetic algorithms (GA) have been utilized to optimize the HVAC system [16,17]. This type of algorithms optimizes the power output of the HVAC system under the mechanism of real-time electricity prices to reduce user costs. Zhang et al. [18] used the PSO algorithm to optimize the PID controller parameters of the HVAC system to reduce energy consumption costs. However, the aforementioned evolutionary based intelligent algorithm has the characteristics of difficult parameter tunings. Kotevska et al. [19] proposes a model-free reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to optimize scheduling HVAC running time to reduce user costs. In complex off-grid microgrid systems, the uncertainty of renewable energy sources and the randomness of user power demand pose significant challenges to effectively control off-grid microgrids throughout their life cycles. In order to effectively address the series of changes that occur during the life cycle of an isolated grid containing gradual and sudden changes, Totaro et al. [20] proposed a novel model-based reinforcement learning algorithm for the lifelong control of a microgrid. However, RL algorithms have strong limitations to solve the problem of high-dimensional state information, and it is also difficult to deal with continuous action space problems [21]. Yan et al. [22] proposed a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm to optimize the multi-objective function of the HVAC system to reduce the power consumption of the HVAC system; Zou et al. [23] proposed a framework aiming to achieve optimal control over Air Handling Units (AHUs) by implementing long-short-term-memory (LSTM) networks to approximate real-world HVAC operations to build DRL training environments. However, the future changes of outdoor temperature and the delay response of indoor temperature are not considered in the above control algorithms, which could not guarantee the user comfort. Considering to characterize the dynamic changes of outdoor temperature, the featured regression methods have been used such as Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average model (ARIMA) [24], Monte Carlo algorithm [25] and grey prediction model (GPM) [26] etc. Bouznad et al. [27] employed the ARIMA algorithm to model a random time series and predict the trend of evaporation, temperature, and the precipitation through the analysis and calculation of related climate data. However, the ARIMA prediction model is only suitable for stationary data or difference stationary data set by differentiation. Taking in to account the uncertainty of weather data, Jing et al. [28] used Monte Carlo algorithm to process the weather forecast data and adopted support vector machines to predict the load of the HVAC system. On account of the complexity and uncertainty of the energy system, Zhang et al. [29] established a novel flexible grey multi-variable model by introducing a power exponential term, a linear correct term and a random disturbance term. The algorithm used the grey wolf optimizer to determine the power index of the model to further improve the prediction performance of the new model. By comparing the fitting and prediction results of the proposed algorithm with those who provided by a variety of competing models, the results illustrated that the novel model is superior to other competing models and offering more accurate and better performance. These conventional methods are suitable for small samples, exponential growth and uncertain system data, but the prediction accuracy for non-exponential growth data is fairly low. With the rapid development of deep learning (DL), nonlinear problems with high-dimensional information have been heavily addressed by the DL, which has shown obvious advantages in classification, image processing, natural language processing, and regression analysis [30,31]. Before using DL approaches, researchers initially used radial basis function neural networks (RBFNN), BP neural networks and wavelet neural networks (WNN), etc. [32\u201334]. These types of algorithm have simple network structures and fast training speed. However, they are easy to fall into a local optimal solution due to the limited approximation ability. New neural networks such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), LSTM neural networks, autoencoders and Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) have been gradually applied to the prediction of time series data [35\u201338]. Zhang et al. [36] combined LSTM neural networks and fully connected layers to establish short-term and long-term prediction models for sea level temperature forecasting; Moumita et al. [39] proposed a stacked autoencoder model that combined sea level temperature and sea level pressure predictors to accurately predict the summer monsoon two months in advance. To accurately predict the metal temperature of the re-heater tube in real-time, Yin et al. [40] proposed a multi-feature-scale fusion temporal convolution network prediction model, which has a strong ability of feature extraction and nonlinear function fitting, and can infinitely approximate the relationship between input and output data. Innovative methods feature construction, spatial partition and feature fusion, are proposed to improve the prediction accuracy of the temperature distribution of the reheater tube. These type of algorithm usually adopts mean square error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) as loss functions. However, the both MSE and MAE index have poor robustness and low prediction accuracy when processing non-Gaussian data [41\u201343], which calls for more effective approaches in the function design. In this paper, a new HVAC control system method based on a multi-step predictive deep reinforcement learning algorithm (MSP-DRL) is proposed. The major contributions of the paper are as follows: (1) In addressing the non-Gaussian nature of Outdoor ambient temperature, a LSTM neural network based on the generalized cross entropy (GC-LSTM) loss function multi-step prediction model is proposed to improve the accuracy and robustness of prediction; (2) To improve the user comfort, the both current indoor temperature and the predicted outdoor ambient temperature are simultaneously considered in the predictive modeling process and decision method, which can better ensure the user's comfort. (3) A new model-free multi-step predictive deep reinforcement learning (MSP-DRL) algorithm based on policy function is proposed to intelligently adjust the power output of the HVAC system as the environmental information changes. The algorithm framework will more effectively reduce the power consumption of the HVAC system, where the user comfort is maintained simultaneously. The rest of the article is organized as follows: Section II introduces the simple mathematical model of the HVAC system for temperature changes, and then RL theory is used to describe the HVAC control system; Section III proposes GC-LSTM neural network, and demonstrate the theory of HVAC control system based on the multi-step predictive Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm; Section IV verifies the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm through simulation and comparison with multiple counterpart algorithms; Section V and Section VI make the discussions and conclusion respectively. 2 Problem formation As one of the high-power devices on the user side, the HVAC system has the characteristics of large power consumption and strong controllability. Driven by the era of smart grid and Internet of Things [44,45], the power output of the HVAC system is intelligently optimized and controlled. It can bring effective economic benefits to users while not affecting their satisfaction [12]. However, the accurate model of HVAC system is usually difficult to be formulated, which could affected the control performance. In the following, HVAC system control problem based a model-free reinforcement learning is described. 2.1 HVAC system changes to temperature HVAC system is a complex control system including Heating, Ventilation, Air-conditioning and Cooling, serving cooling and heating functions. Many researchers have addressed HVAC system modeling, optimization control and stability analysis [46]. Among them, the modeling of HVAC control system for indoor temperature is an extremely complex process. It is necessary not only to consider some quantifiable factors such as outdoor temperature changes and indoor temperature changes, but also to consider some non-quantifiable factors such as the influence of the heat generated by the HVAC system itself and the influence of the heat generated by other equipment on the change of ambient temperature [14,15], whereas the heat generated by HVAC and other equipment is data that may be unknown. Under the influence of the dynamic electricity price of the smart grid, the change of the electricity price is also crucial to the user's satisfaction and power consumption cost of HVAC system. In this study, the mathematical model of the output power P HVAC of the HVAC control system on indoor temperature T in (t + 1) changes is used [15], as shown in the following formulation (1): (1) T i n ( t + 1 ) = ς ⋅ T i n ( t ) + 1 − ς T out ( t ) ± η HV AC P HV AC A In formulation (1), T in (t) and T out (t) are the indoor temperature and outdoor temperature at time t, respectively. ς the coefficient of inertia, which is equivalent to the weight coefficient among the indoor temperature, the outdoor temperature and the output power of the HVAC system. A is the overall thermal conductivity, which is the coefficient of the output power of the HVAC system to the temperature conversion. In \u2018±\u2018,\u2019 + \u2019 and\u2019 − \u2019 indicate that the HVAC is in heating mode and cooling mode, respectively. By controlling the output power of the HVAC system, the indoor temperature can be smoothly and effectively controlled within a certain range to meet the user's sense of experience and satisfaction, as shown in the following formulation (2), where T min and T max are the lower limit and upper limit of the human body comfort temperature, respectively. formula (3) describes the power consumption cost c(t) the of HVAC system in time interval Δt, and ρ(t) is the electricity price at time t. (2) T min ≤ T i n t ≤ T max (3) c t = Δ t · P HV AC t · ρ t From the above analysis, it can be known that the change of environmental information strictly follows the change of the time series, such as the temperature at the next moment is affected by the temperature at previous moment. The indoor temperature value is controlled by the output power of the HVAC system, and the cost of the HVAC system will be determined by the output power of the HVAC system and the dynamic electricity price. The adjustment process of the HVAC system to the indoor temperature is a dynamic process that affects each other, and the process can be described by RL theory. 2.2 Reinforcement learning HVAC system Reinforcement learning is another machine learning algorithm that is different from supervised learning and unsupervised learning. RL is an intelligent algorithm with model-free and no prior information. It is widely used to solve optimization control problems, such as AI games, Robot control, intelligent driving and other fields [47]. Reinforcement learning is an online learning algorithm whose goal is to maximize the reward of the agent itself. The main idea of the algorithm is that the agent continuously interacts with the environment through full \u2018exploration-utilization\u2019 to obtain the optimal control strategy based on the current state. Reinforcement learning algorithm mainly includes five basic components: state, action, reward, strategy and environment [48]. After undergoing \u2018exploration-utilization\u2019 learning, the agent selects action with the optimal strategy a in the environment state s to obtain the maximum reward r max, and the environment reaches the next new state s\u2032. In the following, the state, actions, and rewards of the reinforcement learning algorithm are used to define the HVAC control system. 1) State information S(t): In the HVAC intelligent control system, the environmental information includes the current and future outdoor ambient temperature T out (t), T out \u2032 t + 1 , \u2026 , T out \u2032 t + n at n time, the current indoor ambient temperature T in (t), and the dynamic electricity price ρ(t) of the smart grid; i.e., S t = T out t , T out \u2032 t + 1 , \u2026 , T out \u2032 t + n , T i n t , ρ t . 2) Action set A(t): In the HVAC intelligent control system, the agent can flexibly control the output power P HVAC of the HVAC system with an optimal strategy according to changes in environmental state information. i.e. A t = [ P HV AC ] , output power of HVAC system must meet a certain range P HV AC ∈ 0 , P max . 3) Reward value R(t): The reward value setting mechanism is very important, which determines whether the agent can obtain the optimal control strategy through trial and error learning. In the HVAC control system, not noly the power consumption cost should be controlled, but also the users\u2019 comfort must be guaranteed. Therefore, two-parts rewards are set in the system, user satisfaction reward r 1(t) and HVAC system power consumption cost reward r 2(t), which are set as shown in the following formulas (4) and (5): (4) r 1 t = − λ 1 · T t + 1 t < T min , T t + 1 t < T min − λ 2 · T t + 1 t > T max , T t + 1 t > T max 0 , others (5) r 2 t = c t In the above formula (4), λ 1(t) and λ 2(t) are the weights of the balanced rewards. The final reward R for the agent will be composed of r 1(t) and r 2(t), as shown in the following formula (6). (6) R = ∑ t = 1 n r 1 t + λ · r 2 t Where λ is the weight that balances user satisfaction and HVAC system power consumption cost. The interaction process between the HVAC intelligent control system based on the RL algorithm and the environment is shown in Fig. 1 . 3 Proposed methods It is learned from Section II that the HVAC intelligent control system based on the RL algorithm is affected by the outdoor ambient temperature change at consecutive n time instants in the future. In current research, the temperature data of the environment comes from a featured site collected every 15 min in summer [49], and the data is recorded as a three-month period. Actually, the proposed method in optimizing HVAC system requires extra short-term local out-door temperature forecasting, which is not available from any meteor forecasting systems or resources. Therefore, it is necessary to establish an accurate prediction model of outdoor ambient temperature. The probability density function (PDF) of the outdoor ambient temperature data is non-Gaussian, as shown in Fig. 2 . It is the distribution of the temperature itself rather than the measurement noise. Considering the time-series and non-Gaussian properties of temperature changes, where a GC-based LSTM multi-step prediction model is proposed to predict the temperature changes of outdoor ambient. Due to that the high-dimensional state information and continuous range of action space, the RL algorithm and the DRL algorithm based on the value function are usually difficult to achieve. In light of this, the DDPG algorithm [50], a deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on policy functions, is proposed to intelligently control HVAC systems. The GC-LSTM and DDPG algorithms are integrated in the multi-step predictive deep reinforcement learning algorithm, e.g. MSP-DRL algorithm. 3.1 GC-LSTM multi-step prediction model LSTM neural network is a kind of neural network with memory, forgetting and learning ability. Compared with BP neural network, WNN, support vector machine (SVM) and recurrent neural network (RNN), LSTM has stronger model description ability and stability in processing text analysis, natural language processing, non-linear regression and prediction, etc. [51]. Many researchers usually use MSE and MAE as the loss function of the neural network to calculate the error when using LSTM neural networks for prediction and regression. The formulas of MSE and MAE are as follows (7) and (8), y t and y r are the predicted value and the actual value respectively. Since the MSE and MAE can not fully characterize the randomness of the non-Gaussian stochastic variables, the prediction accuracy would be low and the robustness of the corresponding prediction model is poor [41,42]. (7) L MSE y t , y r = E y t - y r 2 (8) L MAE y t , y r = E y t - y r The GC loss function has better anti-interference ability in processing non-Gaussian data for prediction, and improves the accuracy of prediction. The GC loss function is shown in (9). (9) L G C l o s s y t , y r = G α , β ( 0 ) − V ̃ α , β y t , y r = G α , β ( 0 ) − 1 N ∑ i = 1 N G α , β y t i , y k = α 2 β Γ 1 α − 1 N ∑ i = 1 N α 2 β Γ 1 α exp − y t i − y i β α The LSTM neural network is composed of multiple blocks, and each block has a forget gate, an input gate and an output gate. The structure diagram of LSTM is shown in Fig. 3 . First, the processed information X = T 1 , \u2026 , T i is input into the first block of the LSTM neural network, the forget gate uses the sigmoid(σ) function to determine how much of the input information X at the current moment and the output information h (t−1) at the previous moment can be retained by the current block, i.e., the output of the forget gate is f t = σ w f h t − 1 , X t + b f , w f and b f are the weight and bias value of the forget gate; secondly, the input gate uses the σ function to determine the updated information i t = σ w i h t − 1 , X t + b f , then the tanh function is use to generate new candidate values c ̃ t = tanh w c h t − 1 , X t + b c , the candidate value c t of the current block will be jointly determined by the output of the forget gate, the output of the input gate, the new candidate value and the candidate value of the previous block, i.e., c t = f t * c t − 1 + i t * c ̃ t ; Finally, the output of the model is h t = o t * tanh c t , o t is an initial output through σ function of the output gate, i.e., o t = σ w o h t − 1 , X t + b o . 3.2 Proposed MSP-DRL method In order to intelligently control the HVAC system, a DDPG algorithm based on policy gradient function is proposed to reduce the power consumption cost of the HVAC system and meet the customer satisfaction. It is different from RL algorithms based on value functions, e.g. Q-learning, SARA and DDQN algorithm, whose output action value is discrete range. However, DDPG algorithm can output continuous action value, which can effectively solve practical optimization control problems. Algorithm 1 The pseudocode of HCAC control system based on MSP-DRL algorithm.

The agent outputs an action value through the actor neural network based on the state information of the environment, and then the agent evaluates the advantages and disadvantages of the action by the ctric neural network output value. When the four neural networks do gradient updating, only actor and ctric current network update their own neural network parameters through gradient back propagation. At regular intervals, the actor and ctric current neural network parameters are respectively soft-assigned to the corresponding target neural network. The pseudocode of HCAC control system based on MSP-DRL algorithm is shown in Algorithm 1. In Algorithm 1, during the training process, the action is selected according to actor network parameter θ μ and the current exploration noise N t . The current exploration noise is added in allowing the agent to fully explore the environment. The noise level decreases to zero as the number of explorations increases, after that, the agent only chooses the action according to the optimal strategy. The setting of noise is a crucial step for the agent to learn the optimal control strategy [52]. The calculation of the target value y i is divided into two parts. If the environment reaches the final state, then y i = R i is established. Otherwise, y i = R i + γ Q \u2032 S i + 1 , μ \u2032 S i + 1 | θ μ \u2032 | θ Q \u2032 . It is worth noting that the calculation step of Q\u2032 is divided into two steps: an action μ \u2032 S i + 1 | θ μ \u2032 is selected based on the actor target neural network first, and then the target value is calculated through the critic target neural network θ Q \u2032; The parameter update method of the target network is different from the step-by-step update method proposed in the paper [50]. Here, some parameters of the current neural network are copied to the corresponding target neural network every C steps, which can improve the stability of the agent's learning and make sure that the optimal control strategy of HVAC system is learnt faster by using the multi-step prediction DDPG algorithm. 4 Experiment and results In the numerical study, the temperature data of the environment comes from the real open source data set collected every 15 min [49]. The HVAC intelligent online control system based on the multi-step predictive DDPG algorithm is shown in Fig. 4 . The simulation experiment of the HVAC intelligent control system based on MSP-DRL method is divided into two steps: the establishment of a multi-step prediction model for outdoor ambient temperature, and the training and online test of the HVAC control system based on the MSP-DRL method. In the multi-step forecast establishment stage, the time series of environmental temperature data is converted into supervised series data and normalized to improve the accuracy of the prediction. Then the data set is divided into a training set and a test set, which are used to train and test the multi-step prediction model based on the GC-LSTM algorithm. The prediction results are also compared with popular counterpart algorithms. Finally, the outdoor temperature multi-step prediction model is obtained. In the second step, the training set is used to train HVAC control system based on the multi-step predictive DPPG algorithm. The test set is used to validate the trained HVAC control model online, and the final test results is compared with different algorithms and scenarios. In the HVAC control system, the output power of the HVAC system and the indoor temperature on the indoor temperature was not immediate, which seriously affects the comfort of the user. Therefore, T out (t) of formulation (1) is replaced by the predicted value T out \u2032 ( t + 1 ) based on the GC-LTM neural network. All simulation programs are run on a workstation with i9-10900 K CPU, and the tensorflow and keras frameworks are compiled on python. 4.1 Description of data and experimental parameters In the HVAC control system based on multi-step predictive deep reinforcement learning, the setting of parameters is critical to the convergence of the neural network. The main parameter settings of the GC-LSTM neural network include the number of iterations, the number of minimum batch gradient descent, and the number of LSTM cells, which are 100, 32 and 100 respectively. In the training process, the dropout function is used to prevent the neural network from over-fitting, and the Adam function is used for gradient back propagation to update the network parameters. In the DDPG algorithm, the actor network includes an input layer, two hidden layers (the activation function is Relu and tanh), and an output layer (the activation function is sigmoid). The hidden layer activation function of the ctric network is set to Relu, and the output layer is a linear fully connected layer. The remaining main parameters of the environment and the multi-step predictive DDPG algorithm are presented in Table 1 . 4.2 GC-LSTM prediction results and discussion The outdoor temperature data at 6 consecutive time points are input to the GC-LSTM neural network to predict the outdoor temperature at 3 time points in the future. In order to evaluate the prediction accuracy of the proposed GC-LSTM algorithm, under the same parameters and conditions, LSTM neural networks based on GC, MSE, and MAE loss functions are trained and tested respectively. The GC-LSTM algorithm based model is also compared with counterparts prediction algorithms, e.g., BP with attention mechanism, RNN, GRU, and TCN neural network. Fig. 5 shows the comparison between the multi-step predicted value and the actual value of part of the test set, where the GC-LSTM method is compared with the 6 algorithms mentioned above. Based on the above 7 algorithms, the PDF of the absolute value of the error between the predicted value and the actual value at the t + 1 step is shown in Fig. 6 . It can be seen that the blue line, representing the GC-LSTM algorithm, is higher and narrower, and the PDF of the prediction error is closer to the distribution near 0 compared with the lines of other colors. This shows that the multi-step prediction model based on GC-LSTM neural network has higher prediction accuracy when processing non-Gaussian outdoor temperature signals. The training time of the multi-step prediction model and the RMSE, R 2, and MAE indicators of the error between the actual value and the predicted value of the test set are shown in Table 2 . It can be seen from Table 2 that the RMSE and MAE of the prediction error are smaller, and R 2 is larger based on the GC-LSTM neural network compared with other algorithms. Comparing with MSE-LSTM, BP-attention and GRU algorithms, the prediction accuracy of proposed GC-LSTM algorithm was improved by 11.63%, 33.62% and 13.39% at t + 1, respectively. Although the error indicators of the TCN neural network are close to the proposed algorithm, the training time of the TCN neural network is 4.5 times longer than the GC-LSTM algorithm. 4.3 Results and discussion of HVAC system control Based on the above established multi-step prediction model for outdoor temperature, the simulation experiment of HVAC control system under the proposed multi-step prediction DDPG algorithm is executed. Fig. 7 shows the training reward changes of the HVAC control system based on the multi-step predictive DDPG algorithm. In the training process before 80 steps, under the effect of exploration noise, the reward fluctuation is random. After 80 steps training, the reward gradually converges to a stable value. Fig. 8 shows the indoor temperature changes of a part of the test set under different λ values. Comparing with the black curve, the variation range of the blue curve line representativing indoor temperature changes is smaller. That is because the power consumption cost of the HVAC system accounts for a small ratio of the total reward when λ = 1.65. At the same time, the power consumption cost of the HVAC system is lower. The corresponding power consumption costs of λ = 1.35, λ = 1.65 and λ = 2.10 are 67.13, 55.32 and 54.33 respectively. From the perspective of user satisfaction and power consumption cost of HVAC system, λ = 1.65 was chosen as a compromise. In order to test the effectiveness of the proposed HVAC control system with MSP-DRL algorithm, different rule models are adopted. Rule 1: The HVAC control system based on the MSP-DRL algorithm proposed in this paper; Rule 2: The traditional HVAC control system based on on-off rule mode, when the indoor temperature is higher than the set temperature T max, the output power of the HVAC system is 1.5 kW, when the indoor temperature is lower than the set temperature T min, the HVAC system stops working. Rule 3: HVAC control system based on DDPG algorithm without predictive model, which will not consider the influence of future temperature. Rule 4: HVAC control system based on the DQN algorithm, which discretizes the output power of the HVAC system and divides the action output values in four dimensions. Rule 5: HVAC control system based on DDQN algorithm. The comparison results of some indoor temperature changes under different rules are shown in Fig. 9 . It can be seen from Fig. 9 that the blue curve representing Rule 1 changes slowly comparing with other color curves, and the indoor temperature is strictly controlled within the user satisfaction range. The error of temperature deviation from the set temperature is presented in Fig. 10 under different rules. It can be seen that the temperature deviation of Rule 1 is 0 at each moment, except for the extreme individual values that deviates from the range of user satisfaction. However, there are larger deviations for other rules. Fig. 11 shows the thermodynamic diagram of indoor temperature under different Rules. It can also be seen from the figure that the color of Rule1 is a gradual trend, and the temperature value is mainly concentrated around 24.5 °C. The temperature colors represented by other Rules are multi-colored and changeable. Table 3 shows the temperature deviation and cost of HVAC system power consumption under different rules. It can be seen from Table 3 that the average daily temperature deviation of Rule 1 is almost 0. The average daily temperature deviation based Rule2, Rule3, Rule4 and Rule5 are 2.558, 27.125, 10.248 and 17.923, respectively. The power consumption cost of the HVAC system based on the multi-step predictive DDPG algorithm is reduced by 12.79%, 1.25%, 3.15% and 1.83% comparing with Rule 2, Rule3, Rule4 and Rule5, respectively. Through the analysis of Figs. 9, Fig. 10, Fig. 11 and Table 3, the HVAC control system based on MSP-DRL algorithm effectively reduce user costs while ensuring user comfort. In order to test the robustness of the proposed HVAC control system based on the MSP-DRL algorithm, the electricity price information of the test set was added with an appropriate amount of random noise to test the stability of the proposed algorithm on the HVAC system control. Part of the test results are shown in Fig. 12 , the indoor temperature change represented by the blue line is controlled within a comfortable range. The power consumption cost of the HVAC system is 58.54 Yuan. Compared with no noise Rule 1, the power consumption cost of the HVAC system is slightly increased, but the power consumption cost is reduced by 7.71% comparing with Rule 2 and user satisfaction is not affected. 5 Discussions In this study, in order to reduce the electricity energy consumption of the building system, a model-free multi-step prediction deep reinforcement learning algorithm was developed to improve the HVAC control system. This research makes two contributions to the knowledge body. First, the research improves the current LSTM algorithm for predicting outdoor temperature based on time-series data. In the existing literature, when it comes to building a strong nonlinear prediction model using deep learning approaches, many studies adopted MSE or MAE as the loss function, which however may suffer poor prediction accuracy. This is because the raw data collected by sensors is often noisy and presents a non-Gaussian characteristic [35\u201337]. This study innovatively applies GC as the loss function of the LSTM neural network, which enables the model to better handle non-Gaussian data. In the experiments, with the help of the improved GC loss function, the RMSE of the GC-LSTM multi-step prediction algorithm was improved by 33.62% and 34.06% respectively compared with the BP-attention and RNN neural networks. Despite that [38] proposed the TCN neural network which can achieve competitive prediction performance, the training time was about 4.5 times that of the proposed model. As such, it can be argued that the proposed GC-LSTM model can reach high prediction accuracy while ensure training efficiency as much as possible. Due to the limited data variables collected and the lack of comprehensive information in the process of establishing the environmental temperature prediction model, a variety of factors should be considered as the input information for prediction in the future, such as satellite signals, ultraviolet intensity and air humidity to improve the accuracy of prediction. The second contribution of this research is the proposal of an improved HAVC control algorithm. In previous studies, various algorithms, such as PID, MDP, and reinforcement learning [11,18,19] have been employed to control HVAC systems. However, they do not consider the future door temperature change. The change of indoor temperature is not only affected by outdoor temperature and output power of HVAC system, but also by the trend of future outdoor temperature changes. In contrast, this study is an early attempt in this area, which combines multi-step predictive models and deep reinforcement learning algorithms to control HVAC system in a more intelligent manner. In addition, the impact of the output power of the HVAC system and outdoor temperature on the indoor temperature in the HVAC control system is not immediate, which is again not adequately considered in previous studies [11,18,19]. This can seriously affect user comfort. This research addresses this issue by replacing the outdoor temperature value T out (t) of formulation (1) with the predicted value T out \u2032 ( t + 1 ) based on the outputs from the GC-LSTM neural network. As such, the HVAC control system implementing the proposed MSP-DRL algorithm can change indoor temperature slowly. The deviation of indoor temperature is smaller, the power consumption cost is lower, and user satisfaction is higher. In the experiments, the electricity cost of the improved HVAC control system was reduced by 12.97% compared with the on-off rule widely adopted in current building systems [8]. Compared with other rule-based algorithms, the proposed algorithm can also cut HVAC cost by approximately 1.7% meanwhile reduce indoor temperature deviation to 0.015. The HVAC based on MSP-DRL is limited by the experimental environment and hardware facilities. This research is still in the stage of simulation and verification, which is not implemented and tested in a real-life building yet, where new problems may be encountered. Future case study will be carried out to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed method in practice. In the era of smart building and smart grids, it can be expected that the MSP-DRL algorithm proposed in this study can be successfully implemented in building energy systems. The proposed algorithm is implemented in the HVAC management system, and an effective HVAC intelligent control system is trained by interacting with historical environmental data. The trained intelligent system model adjusts the output power of the HVAC system according to the real-time environmental information. Such improved HVAC systems enable and encourage residential users to actively join grid terminals to reduce power consumption cost without affecting user comfort. Therefore, the proposed algorithm can save enormous electricity and energy consumption, which can contribute to carbon neutrality. In the future, the development of high-performance processors and IoT technologies will facilitate the implementation of this system in smart building energy systems. 6 Conclusion and future works In this article, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on multi-step prediction, namely MSP-DRL method, is proposed to intelligently control the model-free HVAC system for building system. Due to the time series and non-Gaussian characteristics of outdoor environmental temperature changes, a multi-step prediction model with GC-LSTM neural network is proposed to improve the accuracy of prediction. Compared with the prediction results of similar algorithms such as MSE-LSTM, MAE-LSTM, BP-attention and TCN, it is verified that the proposed GC-LSTM neural network model has better stability and higher prediction accuracy when dealing with data with non-Gaussian features. The RMSE of the GC-LSTM multi-step prediction algorithm was improved by 11.63%, 33.62% and 34.06%, compared with that of MSE-LSTM, BP-attention and RNN neural networks. The error indicators of the TCN neural network are close to that of proposed algorithm, while the training time of the TCN neural network is 4.5 folds longer than that of the GC-LSTM algorithm. The combination of information entropy theory and the concept of LSTM neural network provides a research idea for the predictive modeling problem of non-Gaussian data. In addition, the multi-step predictive models and deep reinforcement learning algorithms are combined to intelligently control model-free HVAC systems. By comparing with a variety of rules, the proposed deep reinforcement learning based multi-step prediction model has a more accurate prediction performance. The power consumption cost of the HVAC system based on the multi-step predictive DDPG algorithm is reduced by 12.79% comparing with that of the On-Off rule. Meanwhile, compare with other rule-based algorithms, the proposed algorithm can also cut HVAC cost by approximately 1.7%. The HVAC system based on the MSP-DRL algorithm better controls the indoor temperature and reduces the power consumption cost of the HVAC system according to changes in the environment. In summary, this paper proposes an intelligent control method of the HVAC system based on MSP-DRL. Through the discussion and analysis of the experimental results, the convergence, effectiveness and adaptability of the MSP-DRL algorithm framework are verified. The algorithm framework based on data-driven method provides a new idea for solving the intelligent control problem of HVAC system. In future work, a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm will be considered in the cluster HVAC control system, where user behaviors and more scenarios can be integrated. Simultaneously, future case study will be carried out to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed method in practice.

In order to reduce the power consumption cost of the HVAC system while ensuring user satisfaction, a novel HVAC control system for building system based on a multi-step predictive deep reinforcement learning (MSP-DRL) algorithm is proposed in this paper. In the proposed method, the outdoor ambient temperature is predicted first by a featured deep learning method named GC-LSTM, where the Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) is enhanced by the generalized correntropy (GC) loss function to deal with the non-Gaussian characteristics of the collected outdoor temperature. In addition, the proposed temperature prediction model is combined with a reinforcement learning algorithm named Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) aiming to flexibly adjust the output power of the HVAC system under the dynamic changing of electricity prices. Finally, comprehensive simulation based on real world data is delivered. Numerical results show that the GC-LSTM algorithm is more accurate than other counterparts prediction algorithms, and the proposed HVAC control system based on the multi-step prediction deep reinforcement learning algorithm is effective and could save over 12% cost compared to other approaches, where the user comfort is maintained simultaneously.",
