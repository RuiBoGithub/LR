Department of Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering Syracuse University Syracuse NY 13244 United States With the rapid development of sensing technology, occupancy-based control (OBC) demonstrated great energy saving potentials while maintaining a comfortable indoor environment. By leveraging advanced sensing technologies, OBC can adjust temperature and ventilation settings based on real-time occupancy information, thereby addressing the energy wastage issue caused by discrepancies between actual occupancy and pre-defined schedules. This study adopted a first two-year long-term field testing to evaluate the OBC performance in a medium-sized office building, which included one open space with up to 30 people and four cubicles with 4 individuals. Three state-of-art OBC algorithms were integrated with the real-time Heating, Ventilation, and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) system. And the results were compared with a data-driven baseline model. A 4% to 11.2% heating load reduction and a 3.6% to 6.5% cooling load reduction were observed for the open space. 8% to 16.3% of HVAC energy decreased during the heat wave and winter storm. As for the cubicles, OBC achieved a 4% to 64% cooling load reduction, along with an 18.3% reduction in fan power. However, the heating energy reduction was negligible (1%). Different OBCs failure cases caused by sensing errors or BACnet issues were discussed, which could make HVAC systems operate incorrectly and raise thermal comfort concerns. In summary, this long-term field study demonstrated the considerable energy-saving potential of OBC while identifying its five key drawbacks: thermal comfort issues, damper cycling, privacy concerns, peak load demand challenges, and limitations in free cooling. This research provided valuable insights for the practical implementation of OBC in HVAC control systems while guiding its real-world application.

The energy consumption caused by HVAC systems had exceed 30% in commercial buildings and up to 60% in residential buildings [3]. And among them, nearly 5%-60% of energy was wasted during the unoccupied period [4], and about 40% of energy was wasted caused by the inappropriate temperature setpoint, mismatched operation schedule, etc. [5]. Therefore, occupant behavior has been identified as one of the most significant factors for building HVAC systems operation [6,7]. Parker et al. [8] found that occupant behavior could result in up to a threefold increase in HVAC system energy usage. Clevenger et al. [9] conducted simulations with two different occupant behaviors and more than 150% of energy consumption difference was observed. According to Naylor\u2019s review [4], different occupant behaviors could cause a 30%\u2013150% energy consumption difference in commercial buildings. Hong et al. [10] evaluated occupancy-based control in simulation and found a −50% to 90% energy difference between different occupant behaviors. Consequently, more and more researchers are expressing interest in combining occupant behavior with the HVAC operation to achieve efficiency building design. Occupant-Centric building Control (OCC) has shown great potential in addressing the conflict between achieving HVAC system energy saving and maintaining occupant\u2019s thermal comfort. OCC was defined as a control system in which control variables were adjusted by querying occupant feedback, behavior and monitoring the indoor environment [11,12]. Naylor [4] further separated OCC into four categories: 1) Real-time response to occupancy status; 2) Oriented control to individual occupant preference; 3) Control to individual behaviors/activity types and 4) Occupancy/behavior prediction based predictive control. Park et al. [13] simplified the definition of OCC into two parts: 1) the occupancy-based control (OBC) which adjusts the building system setting like setpoint, lighting, etc. based on the occupancy status (presence or absence) and occupancy level. 2) the occupancy behavior-based control which adjusts the building system setting based on the occupant\u2019s individual building environment preference. And thanks to the developments of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and information communication technologies in smart buildings, OCC strategies and its application had grown up rapidly [10,14]. There were lots of case studies with different OBC algorithms, various building and system types trying to demonstrate the energy-saving potential of OCC within the last decades, which could be divided into simulation based and experiment based. 1.1.1 Simulation-based OBC studies Building Performance Simulation (BPS) was widely utilized to analyze the thermal dynamic of a building through establishment sets of mathematical models. A well-calibrated model could not only accurately represents building thermal characteristic such as building energy consumption and occupant comfort but also guide the HVAC control algorithms design [15,16]. Ouf et al. [17] present an OCC simulation framework which can be used to evaluate OCC performance based on synthetic data before actual field implementation. As shown in Park\u2019s review [13] and Naylor\u2019s review [4] most of the OCC case studies were evaluated by simulation. For example, O\u2019Neill et al. [18] implemented a CO2 based demand-controlled ventilation (DCV) on an EnergyPlus and CONTAM co-simulation platform. The minimum outdoor air flow rate was calculated by space CO2 concentration according to the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Standard 62.1. One prototype office building and four climates were simulated, and the results could achieve up to 9% to 33% HVAC energy savings. Jiang et al. [19] compared four different machine-learning approaches for occupant number forecasting. The predicted results were used for ventilation control. It can be found that OBMPC can shift peak load by 3 h and maintain the infection risk lower than 2% for 90% of the time while saving HVAC energy by 10.7% to 28.2%. Pang et al. [20] did a comprehensive OCC simulation study for two prototype commercial buildings with three different occupancy scenarios across 16 U.S. climate zones. Two versions of ASHRAE Standard were used and the energy savings were compared at both the zone level and system level. The occupancy presence sensor could achieve about 19% to 44% energy savings and the occupant counting sensor could save 20% and 45% energy consumption. Ye et al. [21] implemented presence-based and counting-based OCC strategies for 96 buildings in 16 U.S. climate zones considering two building energy code versions, which could save up 10.2% and 12.4% for presence-based OCC and for counting-based OCC. The author also mentioned that the energy-saving potentials were vary from 1.79% to 12.41% under different climate zones and code versions. Zhang et al. [22] developed a detailed simulation for a large office prototype building. Comparing scenarios with and without OBC across 15 U.S. climate zones. The results indicated that less than 1.1% of total building energy could be saved by occupancy-based lighting control. 1.3 kBtu/ft2-y to 3.8 kBtu/ft2-y of energy consumption could be reduced, and the energy expenditures are between $15,000/y to $44,200/y. Heidari et al. [23] implemented a model-free reinforcement learning method in TRNSYS building simulation platform to train an optimal controller, which could balance the energy consumption and occupant comfort under stochastic occupants behavior, solar power generation, and weather conditions. Results indicated that 7% to 60% of the energy could be reduced by adjusting the solar power generation. 1.1.2 Experiment-based OBC studies Although a great beneficial can be seen in simulation-based case studies, the field testing has some competitive advantages such as the ability to analyze real building dynamics, system responses, sensor performances and actual occupant behaviors. However, there are fewer OCC field testing studies compared with the simulation-based studies. The majority reasons are high initial cost, complexity implementation and privacy concerns etc. A comprehensive study for OCC field testing could be found from review [13]. For example, Dong et al. [24] implemented a comprehensive occupancy based nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) in a solar house. A set of machine learning methods were used for weather forecasting and occupancy prediction. Then a NMPC was designed and tested for two-month heating season and one week cooling season. The results shown that up to 30.1% and 17.8% energy could be saved in the heating and cooling season respectively. Choi et al. [25] tested the deep vision-based occupancy counting technique in six office buildings, then integrated this counting algorithm with an energy recovery ventilation control method and then implemented in a small office. Up to 35% of the ventilation rate could be reduced while maintaining the space CO2 concentration properly. Kong et al. [26] implemented three OBC strategies with three state-of-the-art occupancy sensing technologies in a side-by-side experiment lab. Sensor performances, energy savings and occupants\u2019 thermal comfort were analyzed. The results showed that OBC could maintain good thermal comfort and indoor air quality while achieving energy savings of up to 24%. Peng et al. [27] proposed a machine-learning-based cooling control strategy to predict occupancy presence then adjust the cooling setpoint in 11 rooms of a commercial building. The energy savings for multi-person offices, single-person offices, meeting room and the entire space were 7%, 21%, 52% and 21% respectively. Furthermore, an additional 2% to 6% energy savings could be achieved by neglecting short presence periods.. Anand et al. [28] applied three overlapping operational OBC strategies in an office building with multiple zones. The variable air volume (VAV) system employed three levels of temperature and ventilation setback. The results demonstrated that energy savings ranging from 23% to 34% in the classroom zone, 19% to 38% in the computer room zone, 21% to 31% in the open office zone, and 24% to 34% in the closed office zone. 1.1.3 A summary for OBC studies As a summary, Table 1 provides detailed field testing results in the state-of-the-art occupancy-based control field.The table includes information on building type, system type, method, experiment duration time, control strategy, occupancy detection method, control variable and the energy savings potentials. 1.2 Knowledge gap and contributions As summarized above, despite the numerous proposed occupancy-based control (OBC) strategies for design and control purposes, there are still some limitations that need to be addressed: 1. Most of the existing case studies are simulation-based studies or short-term experiment studies and there is a lack of long-term field-testing studies. 2. Most studies utilize occupant presence as control input and only fewer studies include multiple sensing technologies and OBC strategies simultaneously. 3. Most studies predominantly focus on heating and cooling experiments while lacking an overall analysis of OBC performance during transition seasons or under various extreme weather conditions. Therefore, to address those existing limitations, one medium office building with up to 30 occupants was recruited for two year\u2019s OBC experiment. Two types of occupancy sensing technology (people motion sensor and people counting sensor) were employed to query occupancy data. These data were then integrated with three OBC strategies for real time control. The HVAC system in this case study was Roof-Top Unit (RTU) system with a constant supply fan and two stage heating/cooling coil. The OBC performance was evaluated for two continuous year which includes extreme weather analysis. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The testing bed configuration, experiment setup and data acquisition were described from section 2.1 to section 2.2. Three types of OBC were introduced in section 2.3. The energy consumption quantification method was presented in section 2.4. Section 2.5. evaluated occupancy sensing performance. Section 3.1 presented the sensing performance and section 3.2 to 3.4 investigated OBC heating results, cooling results and the overall results respectively. Section 3.5 introduced several OBC failure cases and the pros and cons of OBC were discussed in section 3.6 section. 3.7 compared with other previous OBC studies. 3.8 presented the limitation of the study and section 4 conclude the results. 2 Methodology This research was conducted in upstate New York, United States, in a climate type categorized as DFB, corresponding to ASHRAE Climate Zone 5A. The region experiences a mean ambient temperature of 27.7°C in July and −4.5°C in January.According to the ASHRAE handbook [43] the 99.6% annual percentiles winter design dry bulb temperature is −19.3°C, and the 0.4% summer design dry bulb temperature is 31.6°C. Therefore, for the subsequent analysis, extreme weather conditions were considered as −25°C and 40°C. A medium office building named Campus Planning, Design and Construction (CPDC) Organization of Syracuse University (SU) was recruited from September 2021 to June 2023. This office can be divided into two different thermal zones. One is an open working space with up to 30 occupants working inside and another one is consisted of four small cubicles, each cubic has one occupant inside. Two identical RTUs were utilized to serve the two thermal zones. We installed two depth radar-based occupant counting sensors on the door frames of the entrance and exit, which could count how many people enter/leave the space and give us the space occupant number in real time. Additionally, four passive infrared (PIR) sensors were installed in the four small cubicles to detect motion and presence of individuals. The occupancy data were upload to the cloud first and then stored into a local database every 5 min via Python API. At the same time, HVAC and building system data such as supply temperature, indoor air temperature, temperature setpoint, outdoor air flow rate were queried by BACnet tool via Python program every 5 min and stored into a local database. Then three different OBC strategies (OB ventilation control, OB temperature control and OB ventilation & temperature control) were implemented in those two thermal zones. The temperature setpoint and demand outdoor air flow rate were calculated by occupancy level, following the guidelines outlined in ASHRAE Standard 62.1\u20132022, Ventilation and Acceptable Indoor Air Quality. After calculation, the control signals were sent in BACnet system in real time to achieve occupancy-based control. The detailed experiment configuration was presented in below subtasks and Fig. 1 is the overview OBC testing diagram. 2.1 Testing bed description The testing bed consists of two main areas: the open working space (the red box zone) and the four cubicles (the blue box zone) as shown in Fig. 2 . The cubicles have an area of 60m2(620 ft2and the one open working space is 420 m2 (4500 ft2). Two identical Darkin roof top units (Maverick_MPS008B) were used separately to conditioning the different rooms. Each RTU was installed on the roof and equipped witha two-stage cooling coil and a two-stage heating coil. The cooling capacity is 29.59 kW (101,000BTU) to control the discharge air temperature. The fixed speed supply fan has a constant supply flow rate of 5946.5 m3/h(3500 ft3/m). The energy consumption is about 1500 W, 5000 W and 8500 W for fan-only mode, cooling stage1 and cooling stage 2 respectively. Both supply air duct and return duct were installed at the top of the space to facilitate air circulation and ventilation. 2.2 Experiment setup and data acquisition Fig. 3 depicts the installation of three types of sensors in our testing bed: two depth radar-based occupant counting sensors and two floor mat sensors. The radar-based sensor were installed on the door framework of the entrance and exit, while the floor mat sensor were placed on the ground at the same location. These sensors accurately count the number of people entering or leaving the space, providing real-time occupancy data. Four PIR sensors were installed in those four small cubicles near the entrance, facing the desks, todetect people motion and presence statusof individuals. All the occupancy data were transmitted to the cloud and queried by a Python API and then stored into a local database every five minutes. For PIR sensor, a rolling window method was used to convert motion signal to presence status. Because PIR sensor cannot distinguish between an unoccupied state and a state where an occupant is present but not moving. So, the space was assumed to be unoccupied if no motion was detection for 15 min referred from [44] below. Detailed HVAC system data and building system data like supply air temperature, return air temperature, space temperature, outdoor air temperature was monitored by the sensors integrated intothe building manage system (BMS). All the data was accessible through the BACnet system. In this study, a laptop was connected to a BACnet controller directly allowing us topull/push data from the BACnet system by BACnet tools. We developed a Python program which can collect this data every five minutes, and then store it in our local database. 2.3 Control logic One baseline control logic and three OBCs were tested from September 2021 to June 2023. For cooling experiment, the baseline was tested on Monday and Tuesday and the three OBCs were tested from Wednesday to Friday. For the rest of time, the baseline and three OBCs were tested week by week. This scheduling was adopted due to the relatively short cooling season in Syracuse, allowing for sufficient time to debug any issues that may arise. We tested three OBCs strategies which include temperature control, ventilation control and temperature-ventilation combine control. Each OBC consisted of four modes: 1. unoccupied mode: when the space was scheduled to be unoccupied (18:00 to 6:00) and no occupant detected; 2. occupied mode: when the space was scheduled to be occupied (6:00 to 18:00) and occupant detected; 3. unoccupied standby mode: when the space was scheduled to be unoccupied but temporarily occupied; 4. occupied standby mode: when the space was scheduled to be occupied but temporarily unoccupied. The overview diagram of control logics was shown in Fig. 5 and a detail description was shown below: 2.3.1 Baseline control logic The baseline is rule-based control with fixed schedule. Both RTUs were set to operate from 6:00AM in the morning to 18:00PM in the afternoon. The occupied heating and cooling setpoint was 21.67°C (71°F) and 23.33°C (74°F) respectively. The unoccupied heating and cooling setpoint was 18.33°C (65°F) and 26.67°C (80°F) respectively. The minimum outdoor air flow rate for the open working space and cubicles was 892 m3/h (525 ft3/m) and 90 m3/h (53 ft3/m) respectively. This was calculated by breathing zone outdoor airflow (OA) equation according to ASHRAE Standard 62.1 [43]: (1) V bz = ( R p ∗ P z + R a ∗ A z ) / E z where V bz denotes as the outdoor airflow required in the breathing zone. A z 1 = 420 m 2 ( 4500 ft 2 ) , A z 2 = 60 m 2 ( 620 ft 2 ) , R p = 2.5 L / s ∙ p e r s o n ( 5 c f m / p e r s o n ) , R a = 0.3 L / s ∙ m 2 0.06 c f m / ft 2 . The zone air distribution effectiveness E_z should be 0.8 according to Table 6.2.2.2 in ASHRAE Standard 62.1 \u2013 2019, because the supply air comes from ceiling and returns to ceiling. An outdoor air damper was used to control the outdoor air flow rate. However, as shown in Fig. 4 , the relation between the outdoor air flow rate and the damper position is nonlinear. We collected the outdoor air flow rate data by adjusting damper position and made a look up table for ventilation control as shown in Table 2 . The outdoor air flow rate for small cubicles was always fluctuated around 170 m3/h (100 ft3/m) when the damper position was between 0% and 5%, because damper may not be fully closed. So the minimum outdoor air flow rate for small cubicles was set to 170 m3/h (100 ft3/m). 2.3.2 Occupancy based temperature control logic (OBCT) For Occupancy Based Temperature Control, the minimum outdoor air flow rate was fixed as in the baseline control. Start from 6:00AM, the occupant number was checked every five minutes. If no occupants were detected, the space temperature was assessed to determine if it was within the setpoint range (20°C/68°F for heating; 25°C/77°F for cooling). If the temperature was within the setpoint range, a temperature setback of 3.4°C/6°F was applied, adjusting the setpoint to 18.33°C/65°F for heating; 26.67°C/80°F for cooling and if the temperature was not maintained, a 1.7°C/3°F temperature setback was given (68°F for heating;77°F for cooling). Once the space was occupied, the setpoint should be changed back to the baseline values (21.67°C/71°F for heating; 23.3°C/ 77°F for cooling). 2.3.3 Occupancy based ventilation control logic (OBCV) For Occupancy Based Ventilation Control, the temperature setpoint remained fixed as in baseline control. Start from 6:00AM, the occupant count was checkedevery five minutes, if no people in the space, the space temperature was assessed to determine if it was within the setpoint range (20°C/68°F for heating and 25°C/77°F for cooling). If the temperature was maintained in setpoint range, the outdoor air flow rate was set to zero. However, if the temperature was not within the setpoint range, the Eq. (1) was used with \u201cocc\u201d set to 0 to calculate the outdoor air flow rate for each zone, which should be 573 m3/h (338 ft3/m) for the open working space and 170 m3/h (100 ft3/m) for the cubicles. Once we detect the space was occupied, the outdoor air flow rate will be controlled by occupant number calculated by Eq. (1) for each zone respectively. 2.3.4 Occupancy based temperature & ventilation control logic (OBCTV) For Occupancy Based Temperature & Ventilation Control, both temperature setpoints and outdoor air flow rate were adjusted based on the occupancy level. The occupant count was checked every five minutes from 6:00AM, if no people in the space, the space temperature was evaluated to determine if it fell within the setpoint range (20°C/68°F for heating; 25°C/77°F for cooling). If the temperature was maintained in the setpoint range, we would set outdoor air flow rate to zero and give a 3.4°C/6°F temperature setback (18.33°C/65°F for heating; 26.67°C/80°F for cooling). On the contrary, if the temperature was not maintained, we will set outdoor air flow rate to 573 m3/h (338 ft3/m) for the open working space and 170 m3/h (100 ft3/m) for the cubicles and adjust the temperature setpoints to 20°C/68°F for heating; 25°C/77°F for cooling. The outdoor air flow rate will be controlled by occupant number calculated by Eq. (1) for each zone respectively. 2.4 Energy consumption calculation 2.4.1 Heating season During the heating season, gas furnace systems are utilized in the RTUs, so the power meter data cannot be used for energy consumption comparison. And the primary heating source is the radiation board system installed around the space. Consequently, the RTUs primarily operate in fan-only mode for most of the time, switching to heating mode only during the initial one to two hours in the early morning. Therefore, the energy savings are quantified from heating mode and fan-only mode respectively. In the heating mode, we compare the air side coil load by Eq. (2) and for fan-only mode, the coil actually does not consume any energy. However, it's important to note that increasing the outdoor air flow rate introduces colder air and subsequently augments the radiation heating load. Hence, we consider the OA as heating loss and compare from OA load perspective calculated by Eq. (3): Q coil = C p × m ̇ sup × T sup - T mix (2) = C p × m ̇ sup × T sup - m ̇ ret × T ret + m ̇ oa × T oa m ̇ ret + m ̇ oa (3) Q oa = C p × m ̇ sup × T zone - T mix 2.4.2 Transition season During the transition season, RTUs are working in fan-only mode for most of the time, so only OA load was considered by Eq. (3). 2.4.3 Cooling season During the cooling season, energy consumption is directly compared using power meter data. To analyze the energy usage pattern and energy saving potential, a data driven baseline was built by a four-layer recursive deep neural network (DNN) as depicted in Fig. 6 . Unlike continues system, RTUs operate as stage-based discontinuous systems, with the cooling stage fluctuating between stage 1 and stage 2. Predicting the energy consumption directly in such systems is challenging. Instead, we use DNN to predict the indoor temperature, and based on the predicted temperature, the cooling stage can be determined by the control manual. RTUs work in fan-only mode with fan power for 1500 W until the space temperature exceeds the setpoint for 0.9F. Once the space temperature exceeds the setpoint for 0.9F, RTU will switches to cooling stage 2 directly with cooling load 8500 W. RTU transitions back to cooling stage 1 with cooling load 4500 W when the space and the setpoint temperature difference decreases from 0.9F to 0F. Thus, we use the outdoor air temperature, solar radiation, outdoor air flow rate, cooling load and current space temperature to predict the next step space temperature. We employ a rolling window method in a for loop to predict the next step in space temperature incrementally. Following the space temperature prediction, we derive the baseline energy usage pattern from the control logic. 2.5 Occupancy sensing evaluation Mismatch ratio was used to evaluate the sensing performance as show in Eq. (4): (4) Mismatch R a t i o = ∑ n = 1 N I n N ; I n = 0 , i f Y real = Y measure 1 , i f Y real ≠ Y measure where N is the total number of occupancy measurement data points, Y real denotes the ground truth number of occupants in the space and Y measure is the measured number of occupants. 3 Results and discussions 3.1 Occupancy sensing results 3.1.1 People counting sensor The people counting sensor used in this study has been well calibrated for one week in previous study [26] and demonstrated with a high accuracy with 99.16%. Top of Fig. 7 depicts the occupancy distribution of the space for two years, a typical lunch break can be found at around 12:00 AM. One thing needs to be noted here is the office has an emergency exist and some occupant leaves from that door, and we do not have a sensor there. It is the reason why the occupancy distribution is not zero after 18:00. And this sensing error is quantified in the bottom of Fig. 7. Approximately 30% of time none of the occupants leaves from the side door and about 95% of the time fewer than 5 people utilize that door. The occupancy sensor reset to zero daily at 4:00 AM. 3.1.2 Floor mat sensor Fig. 8 illustrates the performance of the floor mat sensor. In comparison to the depth radar-based sensor, the floor mat sensor exhibits a larger sensing error. The mismatch ratio is about 47.2% indicates that about half of the time, the sensor cannot detect occupancy accurately. This is primarily due to the challenge of accurately distinguishing the exact number of occupants when multiple individuals walk on the sensor simultaneously. Furthermore, this error accumulates and becomes more pronounced. But the floormat sensor can work stable if the occupant passes over it individually. For 84.4% of the time, the sensor's sensing error is within 5 occupants, implying that it provides reasonably accurate measurements in the majority of cases. 3.1.3 People motion sensor Fig. 9 presents the occupancy status distribution of four cubicles for one week in December. Compared with the open space, each cubicle exhibits more occupied standby time. However, as there is no VAV box available for individual rooms, they are considered as one thermal zone. As a result, the occupancy status is determined by the summation of four cubicles. 3.2 Obcs heating results 3.2.1 Obcs for open space Fig. 10 depicts the results of a one-day heating experiment. The green line represents the OA flow rate which is triggered by the occupant number. In the morning, as the space transitions from unoccupied mode to occupied mode, the space temperature initially fails to meet the setpoint, prompting the RTU to operate in heating mode. The air side heating load can be calculated by Eq. (2) and shown in the blue line. Occupancy based ventilation control effectively reduces the intake OA flow rate and achieved 13.4% of the load reduction. When comparing the OA load, about 28.9% of savings can be observed. Additionally, it is worth noting that the OBC savings are concentrated on the early morning, lunch break and late afternoon. During these times, the number of occupants is significantly lower, allowing for a greater reduction in OA intake. There are always two peak occupancy periods occurring at around 9:00 AM and 3:00 PM, and the OBC saving decreased during these periods. Fig. 11 presents weekly OBCs experiment result in the open space, where \u201cVent & Temp\u201d refers to occupancy-based ventilation control and temperature control; \u201cVent\u201d refers to occupancy-based ventilation control and \u201cTemp\u201d refers to occupancy-based temperature control It is evident that the heating mode only lasts for less than 2 h in the morning, and about 3.8% − 8.7% of HVAC load can be reduced. Occupancy based temperature control has the least saving for the open space because only little standby mode can be found, the space is always consistently occupied according to the schedule. The majority savings come from the ventilation control, particularly when the monitored occupant number has a large discrepancy with the default occupant numbers (30). Up to 13.3% of the OA load can be reduced, although the absolute value is below 1 kW. 3.2.2 OBCs for cubicles Fig. 12 depicts one day heating experiment result for four cubicles. It is observed that the cubicles exhibit longer periods of occupied standby time during the lunch break and afternoon compared to the open space, and the OA flow rate decreased accordingly as shown in the green line. However, only 1.4% of load reduction achieved for this particular day even the cubicle has longer occupied standby time. This can be attributed to the fact that the demand for ventilation in the cubicles is significantly lower compared to the open space, as there are only four occupants. And the maximum ventilation energy saving potential is limited by the difference in OA flow rate coming from four occupants. In terms of the OA load comparison, approximately 33.3% load could be reduced during the standby period. However, the absolute reduction is less than 0.5 kW. Fig. 13 presents the weekly OBCs experiment result in four cubicles. In the case of ventilation control, we can observe the damper is controlled by the occupancy statues, and a temperature setback is given to the system. But unfortunately, the energy savings is very limited. It can be explained in three points: 1). The four cubicles are all internal zones, resulting in a relatively low heating demand during the winter season. Therefore, regardless of the temperature setback applied, it does not significantly affect energy consumption since the RTU operates in fan-only mode during the daytime. 2). Occupants consistently arrive on time in the morning, which means that the RTU is not in standby mode and there are no energy savings associated with heating during this period. 3). Ventilation control can only save about 1% of the coil energy, because only four occupants in cubicles. Even the OA load reduction is significant, the absolute reduction is pretty limited, lower than 500 W. But the fan power can be reduced by about 19.7% when the system turn off during occupied standby mode. 3.3 OBCs cooling results 3.3.1 Data driven baseline results Fig. 14 presents the performance of the data driven temperature prediction model for two weeks. The prediction model can be used for baseline energy consumption estimation. The prediction error is lower than 1°C with a mean absolute error for 4.7%. The key contributing factors to the prediction model are outdoor air temperature, solar radiation and HVAC power. With this model, we can estimate the distribution of baseline energy consumption patterns during the OBCs testing days. 3.3.2 OBCs for open space On week cooling experiment result is shown in Fig. 15 . And a reminder for the cooling experiment schedule: baseline is established on Monday and Tuesday, occupancy-based temperature and ventilation control is implemented on Wednesday, occupancy-based ventilation control is tested on Thursday and the last day is for occupancy-based temperature control. For ventilation control, the damper is triggered by the occupant number, and we can find a noticeable OA flow rate reduction on Wednesday and Thursday. For temperature control on Wednesday and Friday, a short (15 min) temperature setback can be found in the early morning and late afternoon, when the space is scheduled to be occupied but no people stayed at room. However, based on the observation, only about 5% of cooling energy can be reduced. The reason can be summarized as two points: 1). Occupants in this case building always arrive and leave on time, so only very limited standby time can be observed; 2). The ventilation baseline of the case building is strictly followed the ASHRAE Standard, so our advanced controller could not have large energy saving potential in ventilation control. Because the baseline ventilation is calculated by the maximum occupant number which is set to be 30 in this case study, and minimum occupant number is always greater than 10 people in the daytime, so the energy saving is basically from the difference of the mismatched occupant number; 3). The relation between the damper position and OA flow rate is highly nonlinear. This nonlinearity poses a significant challenge in achieving precise control of the OA flow rate, especially when the damper is adjusted to a low opening position. As a result, the actual OA flow rate always fluctuate. For example, the ventilation may not perfectly align with the occupancy trend during the lunch break. Maybe because the wind speed is higher, or the damper position has some bias at that time. Another thing needs to be mentioned is we also observes negative energy savings for OBCs happened in the morning. As shown in the figure, the occupant number is typically lower in the morning, leading to a corresponding decrease in the OA flow rate. But the outdoor air temperature of Syracuse in the early morning is lower than the space air temperature. This implies that the ventilation during this period provides free cooling, but OBCs limit this free cooling source int to the space. 3.3.3 OBCs for cubicles Fig. 16 depicts the cooling experiment result of the cubicles. Different with the open space, the occupancy-based ventilation & temperature control, ventilation control and temperature achieve HVAC energy savings of 52.9%, 26.9% and 16.4% respectively. This is because longer standby period for cubicles can be observed. And as internal zones, the cubicles\u2019 air temperature is consistently maintained within the standby setpoint, which means the system can turn off for most occupied standby period. This is where the majority energy savings come from. Different from the heating season, OBCs achieves significant energy savings in cubicles. The reason can be explained in the following: Even for both cooling and heating experiments, the cubicles have noticeable standby time, but the heating source is not RTU so the energy saving can only come from the OA difference of four occupants. However, in the case of cooling, the RTU serves as the cooling source, allowing for energy savings whenever the system implements temperature or ventilation setbacks or is turned off. 3.4 OBCs overall results 3.4.1 OBCs for open space Fig. 17 depicts the overall OBCs experiment result for the open space, and the \u201cVentilation\u201d, \u201cTemperature\u201d, \u201cVentilation & Temperature\u201d, \u201cBaseline\u201d is referred to \u201cV\u201d, \u201cT\u201d, \u201cVT\u201d and \u201cB\u201d respectively. It should be noted that when the outdoor air temperature falls between 0°C and 20°C, OBCs show no energy savings as the system operates in \u201cfan fan-only mode\u201d during this transition season. During the heating season, occupancy-based ventilation control can reduce the OA load by 1.28 to 1.88 kW on average according to different weather conditions, but only less than 0.8 kW OA load can be reduced during the cooling season. This is because the difference between the OA temperature and space temperature is larger in winter and smaller in summer. And as mentioned in section 3.3.1, ventilation control might limit the utilization of free cooling. Thus,it can be observed that at times, the baseline exhibits more free cooling compared to OBCs during mild summers.. As for coil load energy consumption, 4% to 11.2% coil load reduction is observed during the heating season on average. And up to 16.3% of coil load could be reduced during the extreme weather condition. The majority saving comes from occupant number-based ventilation control, and less than 1% of the energy can be saved by temperature control because the space is always occupied during the scheduled occupied time. 3.6% to 6.5% of cooling energy could be saved during the summer and up to 8% saving can be found during the heat wave event but the overall energy savings are less than winter season. Because the outdoor air temperature is approximately 0°C during the winter season and the supply air temperature is above 40°C, there is a significant temperature difference of over 40°C between the outdoor air (OA) and the supply air. In contrast, during the summer season, the outdoor air temperature is around 30°C, while the supply air temperature is approximately 15°C. As a result, the temperature difference between the OA and the supply air decreases from 40°C to 15°C. This is why OA flow rate control becomes more crucial during the winter season. 3.4.2 OBCs for open cubicles Fig. 18 presents the overall OBCs experiment result for the cubicles. As mentioned above, the primary heating source of this case study is the radiation panel, and since these four cubicles are internal zones, there is minimal heating demand during the winter season. Consequently, there are negligible energy savings observed from the overall results.. Regarding to the OA load reduction, OBCs can reduce the OA load for about 0.6 kW, but the fan power decreased about 18.3%. No energy saving observed until the cooling season when RTU become the only cooling source of the space. And the overall energy savings ranging from 4% to 21% for temperature-based control, 12\u201347% for ventilation-based control and 24%-64% for temperature and ventilation combined control respectively. The most energy saving comes when the space is under standby mode, then the system will shut down and significant energy savings can be found. 3.5 OBCs failures Different OBCs failures are displayed in Table 3 . As mentioned in section 3.1.1, there are certain failures observed during our OBC testing. One such failure occurs when some occupants leave through the side door, causing our people counting sensor to overestimate the occupant number of the space as shown in (1) of Table 3. Consequentlythe HVAC system will still operate in occupied mode until the sensor automatically reset in the mid night. Another failure is caused by BACnet error as shown in (2)(3) of Table 3. The sense is working normally, but the system responds incorrectly due to BACnet hardware errors, such as a connection error. It always happens when our laptop (the OBC controller is running on this device and connect with BACnet) update system automatically or lose WIFI connection. (4) of Table 3 shows the sensing error happens in the cubicles. It happens when our PIR sensors run out of battery in the middle of a week, so the system will operate in unoccupied mode. In summary, there are two majority failures happens during our OBCs testing. One failure will make the system operate in wrong mode, such as run in occupied mode when no people in the space or run in unoccupied mode when the space is actually occupied. This failure has larger impact for OBC performance, and it could cause thermal comfort issue or waste energy. Under another failure, the system can operate in correct mode, but the occupant input is not perfect accurate. For example, when the actual space population is 25 people, it may be monitored as 24 people. However, this minor difference does not significantly affect ventilation control, as the damper cannot achieve such high precision. The first failure can be addressed by integrating more robust sensors, running thecontrol algorithm on a more robust platform, and incorporating fault detection and diagnostics algorithms. This will help improve the accuracy and reliability of the occupancy detection system, reducing the occurrence of incorrect mode operations. The second failure can be mitigated by installing additional sensors, improving the sensing performance, and implementing calibration and maintenance procedures to ensure their proper functioning. These measures will enhance the accuracy of occupant counting and minimize discrepancies between the actual occupant count and the monitored count. 3.6 Advantages and disadvantages of OBCs 3.6.1 Advantages of OBCs 1. Energy saving potential In the open space, we observed a 4% to 11.2% energy reduction in the heating season and 3.6% to 6.5% energy reduction in the cooling season through the implementation of occupancy-based controls. These controls effectively optimize energy usage based on occupancy patterns and temperature conditions. In the case of cubicles, significant energy savings were achieved through occupancy-based ventilation and temperature combined control, with up to 64% reduction in cooling. Additionally, about 18.3% fan power can be reduced annually. During extreme weather, OBCs exhibited more energy saving potential, particularly through prompt ventilation control. 3.6.2 Disadvantages of OBCs 1. Thermal comfort issue The occupants in cubicles are more sensitive to ventilation control because they are in closed small space, and closer to the supply duct. They can clearly feel the change of ventilation. And the system needs a response time when changing from standby mode to occupied mode, we received several complaints about the ventilation because the system cannot response promptly. These complaints mainly come from three aspects, 1) Noise when adjusting the system. 2) Miss sensing. The PIR sensor used in this case study needs to change battery weekly, and it sometimes runs out of power in the middle of the week. Then miss sensing will occur and the system will switch to standby mode at the wrong time and cannot provide ventilation correctly. 3) Lag response, the control resolution is 15 min in this case study, and it also needs time to response to the control signal (The system needs time to exchange the air volume of the closed space). A higher sensing accuracy is required for OBCs in small individual spaces. 2. Damper cycling issue Compared with the fixed ventilation control strategy, occupancy-based ventilation control will adjust the damper position more frequently according to the occupancy level to meet the ventilation requirements. In this case study, the control resolution is set at 15 min, which means the ventilation rate needs to adjust 4 times per hour. To achieve more accurate control, the damper position needs to briefly return to 0% for one minute before transitioning to the desired position For example, if the current damper position is 10% and the calculated damper position for the next step is 12%, the ventilation rate will not change if we change the damper from 10% to 12% directly. Instead, the damper position has to first change back to 0% and then adjust to 12%. Consequently, in this case study, occupancy-based ventilation control needs to adjust the damper position 96 times per day compared to 0 time in baseline. This frequent damper movement accelerates system aging and can have a detrimental impact on damper health. 3. Privacy issue Even though all the sensors used in this case study are non-invasive occupancy sensors, privacy concerns still arise, especially for the cubicles. Different from the open space, where the occupied states and occupant numbers do not reveal the identity of individual occupants, the sensor used in the cubicles can easily detect the occupied states for each individual occupant. This raises privacy concerns related to personal workspace monitoring. 4. Peak Load demand issue When the system changes from unoccupied to occupied mode, the coil stage can quickly jump from 0 to 1 or even 0 to 2, resulting in a sudden increase in peak load of 4\u20138 kW. And the fan power also has a 1.5 kW jump from stop stage to working stage. For this case study, the open space and the internal cubicles always working in fan-only mode and only fill standby period observed. So the peak load demand issue is not significant, but this load jumping need to be carefully considered in the other case studies. 5. Free cooling limitation Occupancy-based ventilation control limited the air intake in the cooling season when the outdoor air is cool and can be used for free colling. This limitation can inadvertently increase the cooling load demand of the system. But it could be addressed by implementing a coordinated control with an economizer. By coordinating the operation of the ventilation control with the economizer, the system can effectively utilize the cool outdoor air for free cooling while still maintaining the desired ventilation levels when the OA increase. This integrated approach ensures that energy savings from occupancy-based ventilation control are maximized without compromising the overall cooling performance of the system. 3.7 Comparison Numerical simulation studies conducted previously have demonstrated significant energy-saving potentials of occupancy-based control in office buildings, with up to 52% of energy consumptions could be reduced [27,45\u201348]. However, it is important to note that the actual energy savings achieved can vary greatly depending on the specific occupancy schedule [49]. The commonly used occupancy schedule in simulation study includes: 1) Predefined schedule such as ASHRAE 90.1 [50], 2) Probability-based occupancy generators, utilizing data from American Time Use Survey (ATUS) data [51], 3) Agent based occupancy generator [52,53] and 4) Machine learning based method [54]. Despite using these occupancy schedules, there can be a discrepancy between the generated and measured occupancy data, which may lead to significant differences in energy usage [49]. To demonstrate OBC performance in real world application, this case study installed three different types of occupancy sensor. These sensors provide can provide real-time occupancy data to control the HVAC system effectively. Compared with widely used PIR sensors [55,56] or RFID sensors [56], the occupant number-based sensors offer better ventilation control by precisely knowing the exact number of occupants. However, the Wi-Fi [57,58] or CO2 based [59,60] occupancy estimation algorithms require expertise knowledge to develop an accurate model, camera based people counting sensors [46,61] may raise privacy concern, and pressure based sensors exhibit instability issues [26]. In this case study, the depth radar-based people counting sensor was used, offering high accuracy in detecting the number of occupants without compromising privacy [26]. Occupancy-based temperature control was widely adopted since it does not require information about number of occupants, it can achieve 7% to 17.8% energy savings during standby period by a proper temperature setback [20,37,57]. While comparing with occupancy-based temperature control, occupancy-based ventilation control is more sensitive with outdoor temperature condition, occupancy level and baseline ventilation demand, and has a higher requirement for people counting sensor. The combined temperature and ventilation control has the highest energy saving potential [26] regardless of the control strategy employed, the most significant energy savings typically occurs during standby period [4,62]. 3.8 Limitations This study has successfully demonstrated the performance of OBCs through long-term field testing. However, it is important to acknowledge certain limitations that should be addressed in future studies: 1. Dehumidifier energy consumption: This study does not consider the dehumidifier energy consumption, because the system used in this case study does not enable this function and the climate condition in Syracuse is relatively cool. However, it is crucial to investigate the impact of dehumidification energy consumption, particularly in tropical moist climates where humidity control is critical. 2. Heating system limitations: During the heating season, the primary heating in this study was come from radiation board so we could not observe significant energy saving. Future studies could consider using a different testing setup that does not have alternative heating or cooling sources to better evaluate the energy-saving potential of OBCs during the heating season. 3. Occupancy sensing limitations: The occupancy presence data in this study were obtained from PIR sensors. However, one major limitation of PIR sensor is their inability to differentiate between occupied but still status and unoccupied status. It can be improved by occupancy estimation algorithm in the future study to enhance the accuracy of occupancy detection and improve the performance of OBCs. 4 Conclusion In this study,the performance of three OBCs including occupancy-based temperature and ventilation combined control, occupancy-based temperature control, and occupancy-based ventilation control were evaluated in a medium sized office building for two years. A data driven model was developed to estimate the baseline energy consumption. Three different occupancy sensors were used and evaluated. The occupancy data, space sir temperature, supply and return air temperature, outdoor air temperature, and system power were monitored and recorded. These data were used to analyze the performance and energy-saving potential of the different occupancy-based control strategies. A comprehensive energy comparison was was conducted to assess the effectiveness of occupancy-based controls in reducing energy consumption. From the results, 4% to 11.2% energy reduction in the heating season and 3.6% to 6.5% energy reduction in the cooling season can be found in the open working space. About 16.3% and 8% HVAC energy can be saved under winter storms and heat wave event by OBCs for the open space. Temperature-based control, ventilation-based control and combined control can reduce the HVAC energy of the cubicles by 4%-21%, 12\u201347% and 24%-64% respectively, and about 18.3% fan power reduction can be observed as well. But less than 1% energy reduction was found in cubicles. Two major OBCs failures were identified and discussed in section 3.5. The first failure could make system operate in an incorrect occupied mode, leading to improper control and unnecessary energy consumption. The second failure involves sensing errors that affect the accuracy of the OBCs control algorithm. As a result, the system may enter standby mode at the wrong time or fail to provide accurate ventilation control. These sensing errors can compromise the effectiveness of OBCs in optimizing energy consumption and maintaining thermal comfort. The pros and cons of OBCs were discussed in section 3.6, highlighting both the energy-saving potential and the associated drawbacks of OBCs in terms of thermal comfort issue, damper cycling issue, privacy issue, peak load demand issue and free cooling limitation issue. Understanding these drawbacks is essential for the effective implementation and optimization of OBCs. By addressing these concerns through advanced control algorithms, improved sensor technologies, privacy safeguards, load management strategies, and coordinated control with economizers, the overall performance and acceptance of OBCs can be enhanced. The study demonstrates the real-world energy-saving potentials of a real time occupancy-based HVAC controller by a long-term field testing the findings not only quantify the energy savings achievable through OBCs but also highlight the limitations and drawbacks that need to be addressed. This study can be used to guide the application of the OBCs in real world HVAC control applications. Building managers and practitioners can benefit from the knowledge gained in this study to make informed decisions regarding the selection of sensing technologies and the appropriate occupancy-based control strategies for their specific buildings. Furthermore, we also discussed the OBCs performance under different extreme weather condition which aims to contribute to building resilience study since the extreme event occurs more fluently with the climate change such as winter storms and heatwaves. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive analysis to researchers, practitioners, and building managers involved in the implementation of occupancy-based HVAC control. By leveraging the energy-saving potentials and addressing the identified drawbacks and failures, the study contributes to the advancement of energy-efficient building systems.

        "dc:description": "With the rapid development of sensing technology, occupancy-based control (OBC) demonstrated great energy saving potentials while maintaining a comfortable indoor environment. By leveraging advanced sensing technologies, OBC can adjust temperature and ventilation settings based on real-time occupancy information, thereby addressing the energy wastage issue caused by discrepancies between actual occupancy and pre-defined schedules. This study adopted a first two-year long-term field testing to evaluate the OBC performance in a medium-sized office building, which included one open space with up to 30 people and four cubicles with 4 individuals. Three state-of-art OBC algorithms were integrated with the real-time Heating, Ventilation, and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) system. And the results were compared with a data-driven baseline model. A 4% to 11.2% heating load reduction and a 3.6% to 6.5% cooling load reduction were observed for the open space. 8% to 16.3% of HVAC energy decreased during the heat wave and winter storm. As for the cubicles, OBC achieved a 4% to 64% cooling load reduction, along with an 18.3% reduction in fan power. However, the heating energy reduction was negligible (1%). Different OBCs failure cases caused by sensing errors or BACnet issues were discussed, which could make HVAC systems operate incorrectly and raise thermal comfort concerns. In summary, this long-term field study demonstrated the considerable energy-saving potential of OBC while identifying its five key drawbacks: thermal comfort issues, damper cycling, privacy concerns, peak load demand challenges, and limitations in free cooling. This research provided valuable insights for the practical implementation of OBC in HVAC control systems while guiding its real-world application.",
