Flourentzou et al. [33] studied rule-based natural ventilation control with automatic windows in a school gym in a central European climate and found that the system can maintain good thermal comfort and indoor air quality in winter. The challenge in rule-based CO2 demand control is the inflexible control over temperature variation [34]. Most of the existing rule-based natural ventilation control systems are designed to operate according to indoor air quality threshold values [35,36]. A potential solution is to apply modern control strategies including Model Predictive Control (MPC) [37]. To date, MPC is rarely applied to natural ventilation [37]. Chen et al. [14\u201317]investigated the performance of MPC for natural ventilation in different climates and found that MPC is superior to heuristic control. Their research was conducted through EnergyPlus simulations. Further work is needed to evaluate MPC in real-world conditions. Gautam et al. [38] applied various machine learning algorithms to hybrid ventilation system control in a real building. Despite that the building's temperature set point deviation was largely improved compared to a rule-based control scheme, the application of MPC to natural ventilation is still challenging due to the lack of control-oriented models. The existing simple models for natural ventilation are empirical or semi-empirical. The mathematical expression of these models is still too complex and hard to be implemented into MPC [39,40]. An alternative solution is to use machine learning (ML) algorithms to provide data-based and control-oriented models for MPC [41,42]. ML algorithms can identify the relevant parameters and formulate a data-driven model that can be easily implemented into MPC. The popular ML algorithms include random forest, gradient boosting regressor, K nearest neighbor, Gaussian process regression, multivariate linear regression, support vector regression, and deep neural network. These algorithms have been applied in natural ventilation research to estimate the ventilation flowrate [14,15,43]. However, the analysis considered only stationary scenarios through simulation engines, like EnergyPlus [44]. https://doi.org/10.15223/policy-017 https://doi.org/10.15223/policy-037

Natural ventilation in buildings has the potential to reduce building energy consumption and the incidence of sick building syndrome. However, controlling natural ventilation is often challenging. For instance, natural ventilation through operable windows may cause cold draughts for the occupants in winter. This paper presents the key findings of a novel machine learning-based model predicted control of single-sided natural ventilation in a retrofitted four-story smart building in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in the northeast region of the United States. A data-driven methodology is used to realize this natural ventilation modeling, including data collection, system dynamics identification, and control formulation. The prediction model of indoor CO2 and room air temperature is built through a learning process. The model predictive control (MPC) formulation step combines thermal comfort and indoor air quality requirements. Finally, the natural ventilation MPC is tested in the real building, and the results showed that indoor air quality and thermal comfort are maintained successfully, without increasing significantly the heating energy consumption in winter. This scalable data-driven methodology can potentially be applied to natural ventilation in smart buildings.

Poorly designed, operated, or maintained mechanical ventilation systems could exacerbate SBS risk [5]. A plausible solution to mitigate SBS is using natural ventilation with operable windows [6]. In the last decade, much research has been conducted on single-sided natural ventilation (SSNV). The quantity of publications on SSNV during 2011\u20132020 is nearly doubled compared with those during 1976\u20132010 [7]. Research on SSNV has been largely advanced due to the wide application of whole building energy simulation software and computational fluid dynamics (CFD). For example, Wang et al. [8] applied numerical CFD models to study the cross-transmission of pollution in built environment with SSNV. One challenge to model SSNV is to mimic the real-world window operation. Wu et al. [9] proposed a direct forcing approach to model window operations in CFD simulations. Another challenge in SSNV study is to determine the sensor locations. Chen et al. [10] applied CFD simulations to investigate the optimal temperature sensor placement in a building with natural ventilation. Notwithstanding the numerous advantages of CFD, it is impossible to test SSNV control strategies with CFD. The whole building energy simulation software such as EnergyPlus is often used widely in natural ventilation control. For example, Zhang et al. [11] proposed a passive pivoted window and evaluated its potential to achieve a stable natural ventilation rate with EnergyPlus. Song et al. [12] investigated the natural ventilation in central London with EnergyPlus and suggested that optimized window opening strategies consider both energy saving and occupant health. Bamdad et al. [13] analyzed the energy-saving potential of mixed model ventilation in Australia with EnergyPlus. Chen et al. [14\u201317] realized a series of natural ventilation control studies with EnergyPlus. However, the challenge to mimic real-world window operations remains unsolved with whole building energy simulation software. Kyritis et al. [18] carried out experiments to assess window opening patterns for natural ventilation in the Mediterranean basin and demonstrated natural ventilation as a positive passive cooling for office buildings in the hot and dry climate. Izadyar et al. [19] conducted experiments to analyze how the façade opening affected natural ventilation of a balcony. Despite much research on different aspects of SSNV, further investigations are still needed on the indoor air quality and thermal comfort of occupants in real-world naturally ventilated buildings. Short-term SSNV in winter remains a challenge due to the need to maintain simultaneously indoor air quality and thermal comfort. A review of 500 papers on natural ventilation research from 1980 to 2021 [20,21] showed that the thermal comfort is rarely addressed for naturally ventilated buildings in winter in cold climates. This gap is also confirmed by a report on natural ventilation research [22] conducted by the New Zealand Ministry of Education. During winter, there may be inadequate ventilation rates for 27%\u201379% of the occupied time [23], potentially leading to an increased risk of microorganisms growth in uncleaned rooms [24]. To achieve satisfactory ventilation rates, an on-site experiment of a residential building in northeastern China recommended 2 to 6-min as window opening time in winter [25]. Shorter window opening time especially with a small opening area might not dilute CO2 effectively. But longer window opening time (in hours) especially with a large opening area would cause the room air temperature to drop to an unacceptable condition [26]. To ensure the performance of winter natural ventilation, an Adaptive-Temperature-Amplifier control strategy with CO2 demand control was proposed for office buildings in Stuttgart [27]; EnergyPlus simulations showed thermal discomfort occurred only for a small range of time. However, the analysis of data from 94 naturally ventilated classrooms in the same geographic region showed that spontaneous natural window ventilation in winter results in high indoor CO2 levels, and concluded that necessary measures are still required to maintain thermal discomfort and minimize the risk of cold draughts [28]. A study in the UK also reported risks of high CO2 level up to 5567 ppm and cold draughts adjacent to the window openings in naturally ventilated classrooms [29]. Another issue for winter natural ventilation is the difficulty in controlling indoor air speeds and distributions [30] that add more challenges to ensure satisfactory thermal comfort [31]. Hence, winter natural ventilation is often compromised as a short-term emergency solution in buildings, especially schools [32]. One reason for the difficulty to maintain an acceptable indoor CO2 level (1000\u20131500 ppm) and avoid the cold draught in cold winter is attributable to manually operable windows that are widely used for natural ventilation now. A potential solution to improve the performance of winter natural ventilation is to design motorized operable windows regulated by a proper control strategy. State-of-the-art popular control strategy for natural ventilation is rule-based CO2 demand control. Flourentzou et al. [33] studied rule-based natural ventilation control with automatic windows in a school gym in a central European climate and found that the system can maintain good thermal comfort and indoor air quality in winter. The challenge in rule-based CO2 demand control is the inflexible control over temperature variation [34]. Most of the existing rule-based natural ventilation control systems are designed to operate according to indoor air quality threshold values [35,36]. A potential solution is to apply modern control strategies including Model Predictive Control (MPC) [37]. To date, MPC is rarely applied to natural ventilation [37]. Chen et al. [14\u201317]investigated the performance of MPC for natural ventilation in different climates and found that MPC is superior to heuristic control. Their research was conducted through EnergyPlus simulations. Further work is needed to evaluate MPC in real-world conditions. Gautam et al. [38] applied various machine learning algorithms to hybrid ventilation system control in a real building. Despite that the building's temperature set point deviation was largely improved compared to a rule-based control scheme, the application of MPC to natural ventilation is still challenging due to the lack of control-oriented models. The existing simple models for natural ventilation are empirical or semi-empirical. The mathematical expression of these models is still too complex and hard to be implemented into MPC [39,40]. An alternative solution is to use machine learning (ML) algorithms to provide data-based and control-oriented models for MPC [41,42]. ML algorithms can identify the relevant parameters and formulate a data-driven model that can be easily implemented into MPC. The popular ML algorithms include random forest, gradient boosting regressor, K nearest neighbor, Gaussian process regression, multivariate linear regression, support vector regression, and deep neural network. These algorithms have been applied in natural ventilation research to estimate the ventilation flowrate [14,15,43]. However, the analysis considered only stationary scenarios through simulation engines, like EnergyPlus [44]. To fill the above research gaps, this study will develop and implement an MPC based on data-drive prediction models for short-term winter natural ventilation in a real building in very cold climate. The goal of this paper is to study the potential of short-term (5 min) winter natural ventilation to regulate indoor CO2 level without causing significant decrease in indoor air temperature. This study also explores the potential energy penalties of short-term winter natural ventilation. The innovation of this study is to propose the concept of short-term winter natural ventilation in very cold climate to maintain indoor air quality and implement a MPC with data-driven prediction models in a real building to minimize the decrease in indoor temperature and the increase in heating energy supply. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Building and heating & ventilating system MPC of short-term winter natural ventilation is implemented in a room of a building (Fig. 1 a) located in Cambridge, MA. The building is smart by installing over 300 sensors to monitor environmental parameters and regulate indoor environmental quality. The building has 4 floors with a total floor area of 365 m2. The room for MPC test is on the 3rd floor and has a dimension of 3.85 × 2.60 × 3.00 m. The roof and exterior wall of the room is insulated to reach a U value of 0.13 and 0.18 W m2 K−1, respectively. A concrete layer of 8.3 cm is added to the existing floor. Insulation is added between the concrete layer and the existing floor to prevent heat transmission between different thermal zones. Two windows are added to the exterior wall (Fig. 1b). Each window has two panels. The upper panel is bottom-hinged and operated automatically. The lower panel is bottom- or right-hinged and operated manually. The windows are triple pane with a U value of 0.8 W m2 k−1 and solar heat gain coefficient of 0.5. The room is conditioned by thermally active building system (TABS) [45] with energy supply from a geothermal heat pump. Water tubes are embedded in the concrete layer of the floor. The tubes are 1.9 cm below the floor surface and are separated by a distance of 15 cm. Due to the high thermal inertia of the concrete layer, the space heating and cooling is not regulated by room setpoint temperature. Instead, the concrete layer temperature is controlled according to the predicted outdoor air temperature in 24\u201348 h. The detailed control strategy and setpoints can be found in Ref. [46]. As the experiments in this study were carried out in winter. The operation strategy for winter period is briefly introduced. When predicted outdoor air temperature is below 8 °C, warm water from heat pumps is supplied to TABS for space heating. The supply water temperature is adjusted based on the outdoor temperature and the water flow rate is modulated according to the concrete layer temperature. Since TABS can only provide space heating, an additional ventilation system is needed to maintain indoor air quality. The room is 100% naturally ventilated. During the experimental period, only the automated windows were operated to facilitate SSNV. The opening position is monitored and recorded. The two upper windows can be opened to a maximum angle of 18°. 2.2 Sensors Environmental sensors and energy meters (Table 1 ) are used to develop and run MPC of short-term winter natural ventilation. A weather station is located on the top of the building to record outdoor air temperature, wind speed, wind direction and solar radiation. One GS 40.10 knx (Hugo Müller®) sensor installed on the interior partition is used to record indoor air temperature and CO2 concentration. One occupant sensor (Siemens UP258E22) based on passive infrared is used to detect the presence of people. A temperature sensor is installed between the tubes in the concrete slab. Besides environmental sensors, BTU meters are also installed to monitor the water flow rate and temperature. The above sensors are connected to computer servers and used to provide input data to the MPC to operate the windows for short-term winter natural ventilation. Portable sensors are also adopted in this study to monitor indoor CO2 concentrations and air temperatures at different locations. The purpose of portable sensors is to collect indoor environmental data to identify the data-driven model coefficients. The location of the portable sensors is determined based on an earlier experimental study in Denmark [47,48]. The study identified three possible airflow patterns (Fig. 2 ) that may also occur in the lab: 1) thermal jet airflow that deeply enters the lab following the roof; 2) smoothly releasing airflow that is absorbed by the room air near the window; and 3) waterfall airflow that falls from windows to the windowsill, then arrives at the slab. According to the three potential airflow patterns, the lab is divided into three zones (Fig. 2): 1) near the window, 2) the working area, and 3) around the entrance. Three portable sensors are placed in the three zones, respectively. Sensor T1C1 was placed at the windowsill in zone 1, and the purpose is to detect airflow 3 and measure the air temperature near the window area. Sensor T2C2 was placed on the reading desk in zone 2, and the purpose is to evaluate the thermal comfort and room air quality for occupants. Sensor T3C3 was placed above the entrance in zone 3, and the purpose is to detect the possible airflow 1. 2.3 Experiments The first experimental campaign on winter natural ventilation was carried out during office opening hours between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. for 17 days (January\u2013February 2020). The purpose of this campaign was to measure indoor and outdoor environmental parameters such as CO2 concentrations to identify the parameters affecting natural ventilation rates. These parameters were then used to develop the data-driven model. During each experiment, one or several occupants worked in the lab with a closed door and the room CO2 level increased gradually. The occupant-generated CO2 was treated as a tracer gas to estimate the natural ventilation rate [49]. In this campaign, windows were operated to mimic rule-based control and CO2 demand control, respectively. In the rule-based control experiments, windows were opened and closed at a preprogrammed time interval of 20 or 30 min. In the demand-control experiments, windows were opened when CO2 level exceeded 1000 ppm and closed when CO2 level dropped below 800 ppm. The second experimental campaign on winter natural ventilation was carried out in March 2020, November 2020, and January 2021, with a total of 10 tests (see Table 2 ). The purpose of this campaign was to implement and test MPC to regulate short-term (5 min) winter natural ventilation in the lab. The duration of each test varied from 1.5 h to 7 h. The occupancy information is a part of the CO2 system dynamics. In the MPC tests 1\u20137, the occupancy sensor was not involved. In the MPC tests 8\u201310, the occupancy information was added to the CO2 system dynamics equation. The high CO2 limit was set as 1000 ppm in tests 1\u20138 and increased to 1100 ppm in test 9 and 1200 ppm in test 10. The motor operation indicator records the window operation: a complete opening operation is 100, as well as a complete closing operation. 2.4 Data-driven models MPC requires a set of models to predict indoor CO2 concentration and air temperature in a time horizon of 5 min. In this study, linear data-driven models are proposed to predict short-term winter natural ventilation. The system dynamics of indoor CO2 concentration and air temperature are obtained by the single subspace algorithm [50,51] in the following form. (1) C z ( k + 1 ) = a 1 * C z ( k ) + U * g C + n G (2) T z 1 ( k + 1 ) = a 2 * T z 1 ( k ) + U * g T Where, C z (k) is the indoor CO2 concentration at kth time interval (ppm); T z1 (k) is the room air temperature at kth time interval (°C); U is the motorized operable window opening ranging from 0 to 100%; n is the number of persons inside the room, 1\u20134 persons in this study; G is the CO2 generated by one occupant inside the room, approximately 0.31 L/min [4], equivalent to 11 ppm/min in the lab; a1 and a2 are the model coefficients to be determined; gC and gT are linear functions of selected parameters affecting natural ventilation rates statistically, and these parameters need identified. The parameters for gC and gT are nonlinear combination of indoor-outdoor air temperature difference, external wind speeds and directions that are assumed to affect short-term winter natural ventilation rates. The ventilation rates are described by the following statistical relationship: (3) V N V = U * f 1 ( p a r a m e t e r s f o r g C a n d g T ) where, V NV is the natural ventilation flow rate (m3/min); f 1 is a linear function of the parameters. To obtain these parameters statistically, V NV needs to be estimated. In this study, the CO2 generated by occupants is used as a tracer gas [52] to estimate the natural ventilation rate with the mass balance equation: (4) v C z 2 ( k + 1 ) − C z 2 ( k ) Δ t = n G − V N V ( C z 2 ( k ) − C a t m ) where, v is the volume of room space (m3); C z2 (k) is the CO2 concentration for zone 2 at kth time interval, (ppm); C atm is the CO2 concentration in the local atmosphere (assumed as 400 ppm); Δt is the time interval, (1 min). The indoor CO2 concentration and air temperature in each zone is a weighted average of different sensors (See Table 3 ). For example, the indoor CO2 concentration at zone 1 is a weighted value of the windowsill sensor (80%) and reading desk sensor (20%). The weighting 80% and 20% is to maintain a balance between temperature variance in windowsill and temperature relative stability in reading desk area. The 80% windowsill sensor measurement introduced more the windowsill air temperature in the temperature control reference. With the weighted indoor CO2 concentrations (Table 3), the regression analysis [50,51] is utilized to find the best group of parameters for gC and gT based on R2. The statistically selected parameters are given in Table 4 . The R2 depends on external wind speeds and directions. The R2 value is 0.404 for an external wind speed smaller than 1.5 m/s. When the external wind speed exceeds 1.5 m/s, the value is 0.596 and 0.252 for windward and leeward wind directions, respectively. Although the R2 values are smaller, the selected parameters are still justified, and the reason is furnished in Section 4.1. In addition, solar radiation is not a statistically significant parameter for gC and gT as its coefficient is only 2.896 × 10−5. This is due to the short prediction time span of 5 min. In this short time, the contribution of natural ventilation to the room condition is more profound compared to solar radiation. After the parameters for gC and gT are determined, the coefficients a1 and a2 are extracted by model identification [53]. Based on a previous study on natural ventilation with a manual window [54], the room CO2 level and air temperature can be modeled with 1st order system. The data from the first experimental campaign was used to determine the system dynamics for equations (1) and (2). The original winter dataset is split into 79 sequential datasets. Each dataset represents a time sequence during which the indoor CO2 concentration decreases due to natural ventilation, with window opening as the starting point and window closing as the ending point. Most of these sequential datasets are recorded for 15\u201320 min. Three sequential datasets are removed due to their very short duration and the rest 76 datasets are utilized as training datasets for system identification. In system identification, cross-validation is used to select the best parameters for system dynamics. The realization of system identification is through the MATLAB System Identification Toolbox (2019b). The timestep of system dynamics is assigned as 5 min. An input delay of 2 min due to window operating time is considered as a complete window opening requires around 75 s. The training and evaluation method for system identification is the leave-one-out cross-validation. The training and evaluation occurred 76 times; each time, a single different dataset is picked for testing and the remaining 75 datasets are used for training. The analysis shows very similar coefficients among all the evaluations. The final system dynamics were obtained with all 76 sequential datasets. The coefficients a1 and a2 are given in Table 4. The fitness between the original dataset y and identified system dynamics output ŷ is evaluated by the follow equation. (5) A c c u r a c y = 100 * ( 1 − n o r m ( y − y ˆ ) n o r m ( y − m e a n ( y ˆ ) ) ) where, norm means L2 norm that is the square root of the sum of squares of the difference between fitted value as output and measured value in the original dataset. The percentage of qualified tests with an accuracy above 60% are 76% and 66% for CO2 concentration and temperature, respectively. To verify the repeatability and robustness of the data driven model, the experimental data collected in November 2020 from the second experimental campaign were combined into the above 76 sequential datasets to form a new training dataset with 86 sequential datasets. Applying the same process of system identification to the new dataset, the new coefficients for parameters in gC and gT are obtained (Table 4). The new coefficients have similar magnitudes with the previous ones and indicates that the data-driven model can represent the system dynamics of the buildings in different periods. 2.5 MPC formulation The MPC formulation contains two parts: the objective function and the constraint conditions. The objective function defines the optimization goal for the control action and is set to minimize the operable window opening area and the change of its position. For winter natural ventilation, the constraint conditions include indoor air quality and thermal comfort requirements. The indoor CO2 level is recommended to be not more than 700 ppm higher than the outdoor CO2 level [4,55]. In this study, the outdoor air CO2 level is around 400 ppm [56] and the upper limit of indoor CO2 level is set to 1100 ppm. A margin of 100 ppm is considered for control practice and the CO2 level upper limit is therefore 1000 ppm. In this study, the thermal comfort requirements are simplified as 1) room air temperature range between 20°C and 24°C, and 2) change of room air temperature in 5 min should be less than 1°C. The initial formation of winter natural ventilation MPC is as follows: Objective function: (6) min c 1 * ∑ U ( k ) 2 + c 2 * ∑ ( U ( k ) − U ( k − 1 ) ) 2 With system dynamics in the format of equations (1) and (2). Subject to: C z ( k ) ≤ 1000 20 ≤ T z 1 ( k ) ≤ 24 ( w i n t e r ) | T z 1 ( k + 1 ) − T z 1 ( k ) | ≤ 1 0 ≤ U ( k ) ≤ 100 % MPC iteration: T c o n t r o l ( k + 1 ) → T z 1 ( k + 1 ) where, c 1 and c 2 are the coefficients (or hyperparameter) to be assigned; T control (k) is the room air temperature at kth time interval, (°C). The MPC iterates to maintain the zone temperature. The MPC, including the optimization, is realized through Gurobi optimizer [64]. The prediction horizon is 5 min that is adequate for short-term airing with winter natural ventilation. 3 Results 3.1 Performance of the data driven models and MPC Fig. 3 shows a comparison of the model predictive and measured indoor air temperatures and CO2 concentrations during five test periods. In general, the predicted values correspond well with the monitored data. Some of the spikes in the temperature data are due to sensor noise. The predicted indoor air temperature is consistent but slightly higher than the measured values during the unoccupied hours. This is most likely due to the neglect of infiltrations in Equation (2). During the period of window operation, the predicted CO2 concentrations are lower than the monitored data. However, the difference is within the sensor accuracy of 120 ppm. To further analyze the errors of the data driven model, the average relative error NMBE recommended in the ASHRAE 14\u20132014 standard [57] is used to assess the prediction performance on indoor CO2 concentrations. Fig. 4 shows the error evaluation indexes of equation (1) with the coefficients in Table 4 for 76 datasets. Except Test #1, the error indexes of the rest 4 cases meet the limitation requirements of 10% specified in ASHRAE 14\u20132014 standard when the for the time interval is 5 min. Test #1 has a NMBE of 10.8% that is slightly higher than the 10% limit. This might be due to the two spikes caused by sensor noise. When the prediction time interval is increased to 10 min, NMBE is increased but still within the 10% limit for Test #2\u20135. The main purpose of this study is to use data-driven model predictive control of short-term natural ventilation to maintain indoor CO2 level. MPC has been implemented and tested in different time periods in the winters of 2020 and 2021. Five tests are chosen to illustrate the MPC performance (Fig. 3b). During Test #1, occupant entered the room at 14:05 p.m. on November 18th, 2020. The indoor CO2 level started to increase from 568 ppm to 810 ppm after 25 min. MPC opened the windows by about 30% for 5 min to slow down the rate of CO2 accumulation. This process was repeated every 25 min. At 15:55 p.m., the CO2 level exceeded 1000 ppm, MPC opened the windows by 72% and the CO2 level was decreased below 800 ppm after 5 min. The same patterns have been observed for other tests. For Test #4\u20135, the CO2 level was higher than 1000 ppm for some occupancy hours. This is because the MPC control threshold was adjusted to 1100 ppm and 1200 ppm for these two tests, respectively. Overall, MPC of short-term winter natural ventilation can maintain indoor CO2 level below the prescribed threshold. 3.2 Influence of short-term winter natural ventilation on indoor air temperature and energy use A major concern of short-term winter natural ventilation is thermal discomfort caused by decreasing indoor air temperature. Fig. 5 a shows the variation of indoor air temperature for a day with MPC (red lines) and the previous day without MPC (dark red lines). Due to the difficulties of finding two similar days to perform the tests with or without MPC, two continuous days are chosen to compare the variation of indoor air temperatures. For Test #1, before 10:00 a.m., the indoor air temperature for the day without MPC is higher but simply due to the higher TABS temperature. The power of TABS is 231 W and 165 W for the test day without and with MPC, respectively. After 10:00 a.m., the TABS temperature became higher for the day with MPC, the corresponding indoor air temperature also became higher. The variation of indoor air temperature is more related to the temperature and heating power of TABS. For Test #2, TABS were shut off and the floor slab temperature decreased significantly, causing a significant decrease in corresponding indoor air temperature. Therefore, it is not possible to compare indoor air temperature in the day without or with MPC. However, a 1°C decrease in the indoor air temperature is observed between 11:15 a.m. to 12:35 p.m. for test day with MPC. This is due to the long-time (80 min) operation of windows by opening 50%\u2013100%. Besides TABS, the indoor air temperature variation is more related to outdoor climate (Fig. 5b) rather than short-term (5 min) operation of windows. For Test #3, a combination of higher outdoor air temperature, higher solar radiation and higher TABS temperature led to a much higher indoor air temperature for the day without MPC. Short-term (5 min) MPC of window operation was not observed to cause sharp decrease in the indoor air temperature. To understand whether the short term winter natural ventilation would cause more energy use, the average daily energy use for the days with and without MPC is compared in Fig. 6 . The average daily energy use for the days with or without MPC is the same, 3.73 kWh. The standard error for the days with MPC is 0.419 kWh, larger than 0.160 kWh for the days without MPC. However, the difference is not statistically significant (P > 0.05). Specifically for the window opening period, for example between 14:00 p.m. to 15:00 p.m. on November 18, 2020, the TABS heating energy consumption was relatively stable at 200 W. Energy penalty for short-term winter natural ventilation was not observed during the on-site tests. 4 Discussion 4.1 Parameters for gC and gT and system identification The parameter identification for gC and gT and the system identification are two important steps in this study. In Table 4, the accuracy of the regression for high-speed wind from the leeward direction is relatively low. When the wind comes from the leeward direction in winter, the cold air flow is unlikely to enter the lab as Airflow 1 in Fig. 2. One MPC design goal is to avoid Airflow 1 in Fig. 2. In this context, the regression of high-speed wind from the leeward direction is less important than that of high-speed wind from the windward direction. Therefore, the selection of the same parameters for gC and gT is justified for both wind conditions. Furthermore, the selection of these parameters is a trade-off between the flow rate regression accuracy and the simplicity of form. The deployment of these parameters is to directly predict the CO2 and temperature trend in the room through system identification, as shown in Table 4. The interpretation of system identification accuracy is crucial to understand the modeling. Two evaluation cases with different accuracies for CO2 level are illustrated in Fig. 7 . The curve in the case of 53% is still capable to predict well the CO2 level trend in 10\u201315 min, that is good enough for the MPC in this study with a control interval of 5 min. The accuracy in Fig. 7 measures the fitness between the identified curve and measured data. Therefore, the cases with an accuracy of around 50% are good to be used in this study, and the accuracy of 60% is used as a stricter criterion. A similar discussion about temperature trends can be found in our previous study [58]. 4.2 Capability of short-term winter natural ventilation to alleviate SBS The alleviation of SBS can be achieved by supplying sufficient fresh air. ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 62.1 [4] recommends 30 m3/h for each person. In the test room, one person occupied the room most of the time. The estimated fresh air flowrates are given in Fig. 8 . The fresh air flowrates are estimated using equation (4). For Test #1, the fresh airflow rates range from 1.79 m3/h to 500 m3/h. The median fresh air flowrate is 180 m3/h, equivalent to about 6 ACH in the test room. The high ventilation rates were due to the combined effect of high average wind speeds of 5 m/s during the window operation period and high temperature difference of about 24 °C between indoor and outdoor. For Test #2, the external wind speed was small (below 1 m/s), short term operation of windows can still maintain a median flowrate of 22.8 m3/h, which was mainly driven by indoor and outdoor air temperature difference over 11°C. For Test #3, the median flow rate is 58.3 m3/h due to combined effect of average external wind speed of 3 m/s and an indoor and outdoor air temperature difference of 18°C. For Test #4, the external wind speed is small, but the temperature difference of indoor and outdoor air is over 16°C. The temperature difference can maintain median flowrates of 43.1 m3/h. Test #5 showed a case that external wind effect competes with the stack effect caused by indoor and outdoor air temperature. With a similar external wind speed and air temperature difference as Test #3, the median flowrates were only 42%. Nevertheless, the large indoor and outdoor air temperature difference in winter shows the potential to drive short term natural ventilation with acceptable fresh airflow rates to alleviate SBS. 4.3 Limitations and future work In the data-driven modeling, the sensor characteristics affected results. For example, the portable sensor accuracy was 50 ppm for CO2 measurement, which introduced more uncertainty in the CO2 room level measurement than sensors with an accuracy of 30 ppm. To improve the control performance, a margin of 100 ppm was included for the CO2 higher limit in the MPC formulation. In addition, the uncertainty in wind sensor measurement also impacted the control performance. When the wind speed and direction varied quickly, and the time-averaged wind speed and direction are therefore better parameters to describe the natural ventilation than instantaneous wind speed and direction. This data-driven natural ventilation MPC study requires a data preparation period for each building, as the training of ML-based control-oriented model needs to learn various knowledge in buildings and the built environment. This experimental data-driven natural ventilation design aims to regulate the airflow through vents for a specified building for occupants. The onsite evaluation should be continuous for a longer period. In the future, research will be conducted to generalize this method and apply it to other buildings, such as rooms with multi-operable windows. 5 Conclusion The purpose of this study is to explore the potential of short-term winter natural ventilation to maintain indoor CO2 level with data driven model. The conclusions include: \u2022 The winter natural ventilation MPC was trained through a learning process after the training data was generated and collected. The trained MPC showed successful indoor air quality regulation performance in the ten MPC onsite evaluation. \u2022 Short-term (5 min) MPC of window operation was observed to cause maximum 1°C decrease in the indoor air temperature. \u2022 The difference in the average daily energy use for the days with or without MPC is not statistically significant (P > 0.05) and mean daily energy consumption is the same with the value of 3.73 kWh. The controllable natural ventilation design is a sort of integrated design with intelligent control in architecture. In this study, the choice of bottom-hung motorized operable windows and window position for single-sided ventilation in architectural design is decided based on sustainable architecture design insight, which results from previous design experience. The ML algorithms in the learning process and MPC control design in this study enable the implementation of natural ventilation in the smart building context. Furthermore, the MPC control design with the learning process is not limited to algorithm design but extended to a completed implementation in a building, as it should be. The MPC control design is built on a better understanding of the building and built environment as an entire complex system and on the insight into how to regulate the indoor environment with weather information.

        "dc:description": "Natural ventilation in buildings has the potential to reduce building energy consumption and the incidence of sick building syndrome. However, controlling natural ventilation is often challenging. For instance, natural ventilation through operable windows may cause cold draughts for the occupants in winter. This paper presents the key findings of a novel machine learning-based model predicted control of single-sided natural ventilation in a retrofitted four-story smart building in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in the northeast region of the United States. A data-driven methodology is used to realize this natural ventilation modeling, including data collection, system dynamics identification, and control formulation. The prediction model of indoor CO2 and room air temperature is built through a learning process. The model predictive control (MPC) formulation step combines thermal comfort and indoor air quality requirements. Finally, the natural ventilation MPC is tested in the real building, and the results showed that indoor air quality and thermal comfort are maintained successfully, without increasing significantly the heating energy consumption in winter. This scalable data-driven methodology can potentially be applied to natural ventilation in smart buildings.",
