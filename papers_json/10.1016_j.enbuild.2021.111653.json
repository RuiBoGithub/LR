Fig. 13 Timeline of the user experiment, consisting of a warm and cool training phase (TP WARM 10 min, TP COOL 20 min), a cool control phase (CP1, 30 min), and a warm control phase (CP2, 30 min). During the training phase, all four trainable models are trained in parallel and the actuators are turned off. During the control phases, during which the models are tested, the controllers are turned on and use predictions of the selected model as controlled variable (in order ZH, MC, DT, SVM, MLP for each control phase respectively). Models assigned to local actuator controllers are switched every six minutes during CP1 and CP2. Fig. 14 Local (top) and overall (bottom) comfort and sensation votes.

Graphical abstract Modern air conditioning makes up a large part of global energy consumption. HVAC systems are the most energy consuming devices in the building sector and also contribute to greenhouse gas emission in the transportation sector when used for vehicle cabin climatization. Conventional HVAC systems are designed to heat or cool air volumes of entire rooms or zones. A much more efficient way is to condition a person directly by generating a microclimate around the body through the use of local conditioning actuators taking into account the respective individual\u2019s preference. This work proposes a so called personalized thermal conditioning testing system which offers a server based, modular platform to test actuators, control strategies and facilitate monitoring and data collection. The focus of this work lies in the evaluation of control algorithms and machine learning heuristics that are used to train individual thermal comfort models used to adapt the system\u2019s actuators to user preferences. Specifically, the control methods ON/OFF, Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) and Model predictive control (MPC) are compared. Monte Carlo sampling, regression tree, support-vector machine and multilayer perceptron heuristics are assessed as machine learning techniques for individual model training. A brief introduction of the modular system architecture is given, and results from a controller experiment and preliminary user study are presented. The system was able to successfully train and compare control and machine learning algorithms in real-time, and to integrate sensors, actuators, as well as skin temperature measurement with a thermal camera.

Buildings are responsible for 20% to 40% of primary energy consumption in Europe and the United States [30]. Among building energy services, HVAC systems rank among the highest energy consuming devices, and account for 10% to 20% of final energy used in developed countries [29]. Due to global warming, the energy demand of buildings is likely to increase [21]. With electric cars on the rise, a reduction in HVAC energy consumption is also important for this field of transportation. Here, air conditioning can reduce the driving range by up to 50%. Vehicles with combustion engines would also benefit from reduced energy consumption for climatization purposes, leading to lower fuel consumption and, in turn, less carbon emissions. These examples give rise to novel, more efficient approaches such as personalized and local climatization systems that can be used for vehicle applications (energy constraints in battery powered electric vehicles) as well as workspaces such as office desks. Currently, most air conditioning systems are designed to heat or cool the entire air volume within a confined space, such as an office room [31]. However, conflicting preferences lead to \u201cThermostat Wars\u201d in multi-occupant spaces [35] since pre-defined zones allow adjustments for larger groups of spaces, but little distinction can be made between demands of individual occupants or passengers. While modern consumer vehicles offer some degree of zonal heating or cooling for different passenger seats, air conditioning is mostly still done by adjusting the temperature of the complete cabin air volume. Large quantities of energy are used to condition air which is not in direct contact with the human body, providing huge saving potentials if climatization could be targeted to the immediate surroundings of a person. Consequently, the more effective and efficient approach is to heat and cool body segments directly by creating a microclimate surrounding the human body. With detailed information about segment-wise preferences and demands, the surrounding environment can be kept at a higher or lower temperatures while only the target regions on the body are affected by thermal actuators such as fans or heaters. Furthermore, individual thermal preferences can be accounted for in a way that is impossible for a zonal HVAC system with a single set-point. Local thermal conditioning 1 1 Local air conditioning requires novel methods to increase or decrease body temperature, hence, the term \u201cair conditioning\u201d is not accurate in this context. Throughout this work, \u201clocal thermal conditioning\u201d will be used in order to also include methods such as infrared radiators and surface heating. requires the use of what is referred to as \u201clocal actuators\u201d in this work. These actuators are devices in close proximity to the human body that can increase or decrease body temperature through surface contact or short distance conditioning, such as infrared radiation. In addition, sensor data about the thermophysiological state of the human body as well as ambient sensor information is required to control the actuators. Lastly, numerical models are needed that correlate sensor information with quantifiable thermal comfort assessments in order to be able to apply necessary control heuristics. In short, the objective of the system presented here can be defined as: minimization of climatization power consumption while creating and maintaining an optimal level of thermal comfort, defined as a desirable, subjective thermal state of the human body, taking individual preferences and interpersonal differences into account. For this purpose, testing environments that allow the evaluation of heating and cooling devices, control strategies as well as monitoring and data collection are needed. 1.1 Related work Warthmann et al. [39] give an overview of the current state and directions of personalized climatization. Rawal et al. [31] summarize comfort, energy-related, and economical aspects and implications of PCS, and call for consistent frameworks in order to study effectiveness and efficiency of PCS in a comparable manner [2]. Current developments include various means of heating and cooling as well as ventilation control. Oftentimes, the PCS are embedded in a wider field of environmental control, including access to lighting, shading, and other appliances of building control systems. The following section gives an overview of the various PCS approaches, the devices used, and their effectiveness as well as efficiency. Vesely et al. [38] state that through personalized thermal conditioning, proximal thermal comfort can be maintained at distal temperatures 4\u20135 K higher or lower than recommended standards. Additionally, simulation results indicate that personalized thermal conditioning can lead to reduction in energy consumption by up to 60%. Indeed, most works conclude that elevated or reduced room temperature is possible when using personalized thermal conditioning systems. While their main focus is on air quality, Melikov et al. [24] give an important insight in possible personalized conditioning system designs using desk-mounted local actuators. Melikov et al. [25] show that at a high temperature of up to 28 ° C and relative humidity of up to 70%, personalized supply of cool air significantly improves acceptability and freshness. They present a thermal sensation assessment equal to that reported at 23 ° C and 40% humidity. Amai and colleagues [1] evaluate three desk mounted conditioning systems and report equal or better thermal comfort assessments at a room temperature setpoint of 28 ° C in comparison to a setpoint temperature of 26 ° C. Zhang et al. [44] investigate the use of heated and cooled seats and the impact on accepted ambient temperature range. They show that heated seats increase the 90% satisfied range of room temperature by 5.5 ° C below and 2.3 ° C above the neutral point. Conceição et al. [8] evaluate local thermal comfort as well as air quality in classrooms where desks are equipped with two personalized ventilation systems. They report that in slightly warm settings the predicted percentage dissatisfied (PPD) can be reduced from 27.7% to 16.1% when personalized ventilation is added. Li et al. [19] evaluate a system that combines personalized ventilation with additional under-floor air distribution. Personalized ventilation outlets are mounted on a desk in order to prevent a warm head effect and outlets on the floor prevent cooling of feet. Yang et al. [42] show how ceiling mounted personalized ventilation nozzles combined with background mixing ventilation can save cooling energy with an overall increased temperature. Watanabe et al. [40] present a system that uses an individually controlled microenvironment to create a whole body heating effect that corresponds to 5.9 ° C room temperature increase and a cooling effect corresponding to −0.8 ° C. Zhang et al. [48] presents a system based on research of local thermal discomfort that heats only feet and hands and cools only hands and the face. Comfort here can be maintained at an acceptable level between 18 ° C and 30 ° C ambient temperature. Pasut et al. [28] evaluate the effect of a heated and cooled office chair on occupant\u2019s thermal sensation and comfort. They conclude that the chair provides comfortable conditions for 92% of participants in an experimental with a room temperature range between 18 ° C and 29 ° C. Taub et al. [36] investigate effects of radiation foot warmers on thermal comfort and power consumption. They show a possible reduction of heating energy between 38% and 75%, depending on the magnitude of set-point change as well as outdoor conditions. The study supports the notion of a bodypart-spefic investigation of thermal comfort. A current example for the application of control strategies and the inclusion of occupant feedback can be found in Liu [22]. While focusing the HVAC system instead of local actuators, the authors show the feasibility and energy saving potential when control strategies and human feedback are combined. Choi and Yeom [6] focused on seven body parts in order to individualize thermal comfort predictions and identify significant and representative body parts, which in turn could be used for a thermal sensation prediction model based on skin temperature. By combining skin temperature measurements from waist, arm, and wrist, and combining these with gender, overall thermal sensation could be predicted with an accuracy of almost 96%. The benefits of this user-centric and individualized approach which combines subjective ratings, local skin temperature measurement and additional characteristics of a person (e.g., gender or body mass index) for environmental climatization purposes was replicated and supported in follow up studies [7]. Deng and Chen [11] followed the approach of local skin temperature measurements, and used data on indoor environmental conditions, wrist skin temperature as well as heart rate to control the HVAC system. Increases in occupant comfort as well as energy savings (when combined with information about occupancy) were demonstrated when these environmental, physiological, and subjective data were used in the proposed artificial neural network. Li and colleagues show that energy savings between 13.4% and 20.5% of the daily consumption can be achieved when skin temperature and environmental measurements are fed back to a fuzzy comprehensive evaluation strategy controlling the room\u2019s HVAC system [20]. The approach of non-invasive thermal imaging to extract skin temperatures has been studied by Cosma and Simha [9,10]. The authors demonstrate the feasibility and usefulness of this approach when analyzing the individual differences in thermal comfort perception, although subjects had been exposed to the same environmental conditions. Furthermore, Cosma and Simha also applied Machine Learning-based classifiers in order to forward the measurements of clothing temperature, temperature gradients, or discrepancies between measurements taken at different body parts to an HVAC system. On average, the presented approach improved thermal comfort predictions by 60% on average. 1.2 Thermal comfort models Thermal sensations and resulting thermal comfort are subjective experiences that vary between and within individuals. They are influenced by external factors, but also vary due to metabolism, emotional states and expectations, or previous thermal environments [14]. In order to properly model and predict overall and local comfort, relying on thermal comfort models is mandatory. Local thermal comfort models allow the differentiation of thermal comfort perceptions for different body parts and are therefore crucial in order to find means of energy reduction in personalized thermal conditioning systems. Since actuators are in close proximity to the body, the distinction made between energy demands for different body regions directly impacts power consumption of the system. This work uses two established thermal comfort models as its basis: the model proposed by Zhang [43] (see Section 2.2.3) and the local mean vote (LMV) index based on the model proposed by Nilsson (see Section 2.2.4). The LMV is merely used as a reference in order to evaluate controller heuristics while the Zhang model functions as a basis for individual models established through the use of machine learning techniques. 1.3 Present work The studies cited in the section before show the benefits of individualized climatization as well as the usefulness of algorithmically controlled HVAC systems. Also, thermal imaging and wearable devices prove helpful in those endeavors. From our perspective, a modular and integrative system would be helpful to facilitate research. Therefore, we describe a modular, server-based system that allows the study of PCS components and control algorithms in this paper. Compared to the existing systems reviewed in the section before, the rationale for and expected benefits of the present study are to: \u2022 present a complete testing environment that allows concurrent comparisons of competing control algorithms in real-time. \u2022 facilitate data collection and feedback collection with a server-based structure and ready-to-use user app \u2022 introduce a system that focuses on local climatization in the close proximity of persons instead of whole-room HVAC systems \u2022 apply the complete system in a feasibility study that compares machine learning methods and PID control strategies as well as first user interaction tests A brief overview is given of the technical platform and its software and hardware components. Here, the Zhang model is used a reference model for comparison. Moreover, this work also compares common control heuristics that can be used for local thermal conditioning systems. Specifically, an experimental study is conducted that compares ON/OFF control, proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control and model predictive control (MPC) in an isolated manner using a thermal manikin and the LMV thermal comfort index. Subsequently, participants evaluate the complete system and its effectiveness as well as energy use of providing thermal comfort under changing room temperature conditions. 2 System overview The software and hardware architecture (Fig. 1 ) presented in this work is the result of numerous experimental tests and iterations. The system is conceptualized as a research platform that fulfills all software and hardware requirements to facilitate research on the local climatization efforts described in the introduction, while maintaining as little domain dependency as possible. The system is created in a modular fashion where the components communicate over a centralized hub via a REST API. This reduces interdependencies and keeps maintenance and development feasible. Software and hardware components are arranged around the central communication hub, which is (referred to as \u201cData Server\u201d). In the following sections, the components are described in order to show the idea and capabilities of the system, followed by a description of the \u201cUser\u201d component, which is essential for the control and learning aspect described in this work. The Communication Protocol utilizes a key-value based model. A component can store a key-value pair in the data server, from where it can be requested by all components. A key-value pair is referred to as \u201csignal\u201d, and can comprise any alphanumeric character sequence. The Signal Database Component stores meta-information about communicated signals such as min/max values and physical units. The Data Server is the central communication hub of the system over which components communicate. The Visualizer allows real time monitoring of all communicated data. Data can be visualized in animated 2D plots or using pseudocolors on a 3D manikin. The Sensor Adapter component is used to convert data from sensor hardware to signals and forward them to the data server. With the help of a CAN Bus adapter, data server signals can be sent and received to a Controller Area Network (CAN). This is important, for example, to communicate with a vehicle HVAC system. The vision component is used to acquire thermal skin temperature measurements using a combination of body and face tracking and thermal imaging. The MORPHEUS component contains a numerical model for prediction of human thermoregulatory responses to static, dynamic, homogeneous and inhomogeneous ambient conditions [41], and is used to simulate skin temperature for body segments that are not visible to the thermal camera (e.g. covered by clothing, furniture). An individual comfort model for each body part head, face, neck, breath, upper and lower back, chest, pelvis, upper and lower arm, hand, thigh, lower leg, foot is developed. The input data are the measured skin temperatures by the thermal camera of the four visible body parts face, neck, unclothed left and right upper arm. By coupling a thermal camera with the depth information of the Kinect, the body parts are assigned and tracked. For clothed body parts, invisible for the thermal camera, the developed comfort models are based on the applied numerical model MORPHEUS simulating the thermophysiological responses as well as skin temperatures based on the measured environmental data. Finally, the Balanced Comfort Model (BCM) component is a model for the prediction of thermal comfort under inhomogeneous climate conditions proposed by Schmidt et al. [33]. 2.1 Actuator adapter component The actuator adapter component converts control signals sent to the data server, and forwards them to physical actuator hardware. In the present study, the component is used to communicate relative setpoints to heaters and fans which in turn are converted into absolute voltage settings and pulse-width modulation (PWM) signals. Fig. 2 shows one of the two local actuator prototypes used in this work. Each actuator has two infrared heating lamps with 150 W each and two radial fans with max. 1600 RPM. 2.2 User component The user component is responsible for individual thermal comfort model training and generation of actuator control signals. The software provides a graphical monitoring interface that, different from the visualizer interface offers a dedicated visualization of the thermal comfort model training process. Moreover, the user component has an integrated server that hosts the user feedback web application through which subjective thermal comfort assessments can be collected for model training. In addition, the user component integrates the software functionalities used to control the actuators. Control is integrated into the user component instead of a separate component because control is directly linked to the model predictions and preliminary tests showed that this combination is more practical during experimental evaluation. Fig. 3 shows an illustration of how models generated by the user component are structured. Based on segment wise model structure introduced by Zhang, each individual segment can be assigned a model that is able to predict local thermal sensation and local thermal comfort. The combined local thermal comfort model can then be used to calculate a global thermal sensation and thermal comfort assessment. The user component is capable of training multiple model types simultaneously. Hence, multiple models can be assigned to a single segment. The specific model type instance used as input for the controllers can be selected dynamically. 2.2.1 User feedback The user feedback web app is implemented as a web app in Javascript. It is part of the user component and hosted by a simple Python Flask web server. The app shows a three-dimensional human manikin with 18 distinct body segments (according to the split Zhang model). The color of each segment is mapped according to the thermal sensation color gradient at the bottom and indicates the local thermal sensation. A small emoticon at each segment shows the state of local thermal comfort. In addition there is a \u201cglobal\u201d segment that can be displayed which again is assigned a thermal sensation and thermal comfort value. At the bottom of the app are two button bars where the user can select a thermal sensation and thermal comfort assessment for a segment respectively. In order to collect a single datapoint the app iterates through all 12 segments and the global segments each of which the user has to give an assessment for. After a full iteration the data is sent to the user component and the internal user models are retrained using the new datapoint and the remaining previous datapoints. The models training correlates the subjective user feedback data with skin temperature values retrieved from the data server. The subjective assessment is also available as signals on the data server in order to be monitored or retrieved for later evaluation. Fig. 4 shows a screenshot of the web app interface with the manikin and the two button bars for local thermal sensation and local thermal comfort. 2.2.2 Controller interface The actuators (heaters and fans) can be assigned to a dedicated controller. The first experimental evaluations show that a simple PID controller is sufficient for actuator control in the setting of the current study. The assigned controller can use thermal sensation and thermal comfort votes of body segments as its feedback signal. The controller user interface (see Fig. 5 ) consists of multiple panels: the manual control panel provides sliders to manually adjust controller inputs. It can only be used if the control is set to manual. All variables and constants that are part of the PID heuristic can be monitored. Actuator input values can range between 0 (off) and 255 (full power). Actual mapping in terms of voltage or fan rotations is determined by the actuatorses. In case of the ON/OFF control, the values 0 and 255 represent 0% and 100%. The scale is used because both infrared heaters and radial fans use a single byte as voltage/PWM control. The controller interface is also capable of switching to ON/OFF and MPC control for experimentation purposes. The system identification and controller evaluation is given in Section 4. 2.2.3 Comfort model implementation The Zhang (ZH) model [43,45\u201347] forms the basis for the models applied in this work. All models use its local/global thermal sensation and thermal comfort ratings scales, and comfort predictions are based on the method proposed by Zhang. As a reference, this model and its original parameterization are compared to the other control strategies which provide updated comfort predictions due to their learning algorithms. The ZH model is based on the rate of change of skin and core temperature as well as the perception of local and overall thermal sensation which is assessed in human subject studies. Table 1 shows the Zhang thermal sensation, thermal comfort, and local voting scales. Zhang created a database that consists of skin temperature, derivative of skin temperature, body core temperature, subjective thermal sensation (19 segments + the overall body sensation) and subjective thermal comfort (19 segments + overall body comfort). A mathematical framework accompanies the model, which describes local and global phenomena and their interactions. The model is parameterized using regression analysis of subjective parameters with respect to measured physiological parameters. Two distinct sets of equations in order to calculate thermal sensation and thermal comfort predictions respectively. The model is symmetric, i.e., right side extremities coefficients are equal to left side extremities. For the study presented here, the non-symmetric version was chosen in order to be able to train each segment model independently. 2.2.4 Nilsson model Nilsson proposes a local thermal comfort index and a thermal comfort measurement method using a thermal manikin. In this work it is used to test controller heuristics in isolation because it omits the requirement for human probands and provides sufficiently meaningful results to derive conclusions for system use by actual people. Nilsson presents a thermal comfort model along with a thermal manikin method that measures a local, integrated measure referred to as the \u201cequivalent temperature\u201d. Nilsson refers to the measure as \u201crecognized, integrated measure of the effects of non-evaporative heat loss from the human body\u201d [27] which can be used as an indicator for human thermal comfort. The equivalent temperature is an integral measure that combines the effect of air temperature, radiant temperature and air speed. The sensors measure the so called \u201cdirected equivalent temperature\u201d which is also defined in ISO-14505 2 [17]. Nilsson derived the local mean vote (LMV) which correlates body segment specific equivalent measurements with empirically determined LMV assessments. The LMV itself combines thermal sensation and thermal comfort assessments as opposed to having two different scales like the Zhang model. Fig. 6 shows the zones proposed by Nilsson that map the measured local equivalent temperature to a respective LMV index. Table 1 shows the LMV scale which serves as a subjective mapping table between the equivalent temperature and the LMV. Note that the LMV in combination with the thermal manikin is only used as a measure for controller tuning as a substitute for human subjects. 3 Control strategies and algorithms The following sections introduce the machine learning algorithms used to modify or train subjective thermal comfort models as well as control heuristics for local actuators, which use the models as predictors. Based on the individual user data, the Monte Carlo (MC) method is used to modify the coefficients of the original Zhang model whereas the decision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM) and multilayer-perceptron (MLP) train bottom-up regression models for each segment. The ON/OFF, PID and MPC control heuristics are the three control heuristics considered and evaluated to control the actuators based on the predictions of the trained models. 3.1 Monte Carlo The Monte Carlo MC method describes a class of algorithms that use repeated random sampling and statistical analysis to obtain a result [32]. It was first formally introduced by Ulam et al. [26] in 1949 and is closely related to random experiments for which no outcome can be predicted with certainty. Random samples are commonly generated using a pseudo-random number generator. The samples are not truly random but possess the statistical properties of truly random numbers. In this work, Monte Carlo is used to reparameterize the original Zhang model in order to fit the specific individual data given by the user instead of the Zhang proband pool. Specifically, coefficients of the Zhang model are randomly varied within a certain range and the coefficient that yield the lowest prediction error are chosen. The number of iterations is set to 1000 for each training which was shown to be sufficient enough for reaching model convergence. 3.2 Decision tree The decision tree DT is one of the three thermal comfort models that are trained bottom up without any prior data or parameterization. Note that the decision tree is actually a regression tree where the leaf nodes predict continuous numeric values instead of discrete classes [37]. The regression tree is trained using the reduced error pruning tree (REPtree) algorithm, which is a fast decision tree learner that uses variance as node splitting criteria and that applies reduced error pruning with backfitting to generate simpler, more accurate trees [34]. During training, population splits with lower variance are selected in order to find appropriate \u201cbags\u201d. 3.3 Support vector machine Similar to the decision tree support vector machines SVM are commonly used as classifiers but can also be extended for regression tasks [3]. An SVM aims to maximize margins of a hyperplane that linearly separates data classes. Samples that lie on that margin are called the \u201csupport vectors\u201d. In order for the SVM to be applied to data that is not linearly separable, it can be extended through the so called \u201ckernel trick\u201d. Here, the data is implicitly mapped to a higher dimension in which a separate hyperplane is constructed. The hyperplane is then able to linearly split the data in the higher dimension. The radial basis function (RBF) is used as kernel function in the SVM used in this work. 3.4 Multilayer perceptron The multilayer perceptron MLP is a type of feedforward artificial neural network. Like the decision tree and support vector machine, it is commonly used for classification tasks but can also be used for regression. The sigmoid function is used as neuron activation function and the output nodes layer consists of unthresholded linear units [13]. The structure of the neural network is kept fixed to a configuration that was shown to be sufficient to represent thermal sensation and thermal comfort functions similar to the sigmoid functions presented by Zhang (not to be confused with the neuron activation functions). Fig. 7 shows an illustration of the neural network structure with two input and output neurons respectively as well as a hidden layer with three neurons. Two individual networks are created for each body part so that thermal comfort and sensation is body part specific predicted. Note that the neural network, similar to the support vector machine provides a continuous function for both the negative and the positive side of skin temperature setpoints as opposed the conditional functions given by Zhang [43]. 3.5 On/off control ON/OFF control is one of the three control methods evaluated in this work. It is a feedback control system that switches between two states based on a desired setpoint and can be regarded as the simplest type of feedback control. Upper and lower thresholds can be defined, above and below which the output is set to \u201con\u201d or \u201coff\u201d, respectively [18]. The interval between upper and lower thresholds is commonly referred to as deadband. While the ON/OFF/ controller is the easiest to implement it is not suitable when the process involves inertia that causes oscillations around the setpoint. Since heating and cooling processes exhibit inertia, a simple controller of this type is usually not applicable. Nevertheless, in this work it is used to evaluate potential oscillations under various conditions and, in addition, use ON/OFF control to generate oscillating test datasets that can be used to identify the system and its plant models. Algorithm1 shows the controller\u2019s pseudocode for one segment with LMV as controlled variable. Instead of actual on and off states the controller turns on the infrared radiators when the LMV is below the lower threshold and the fans while the LMV is above the upper threshold. An LMV of 3 represents neutrality and is regarded the center of the deadband. Algorithm 1. On/Off Controller pseudocode for one LMV value Input: lmv a local mean vote for a body segment t upper upper threshold t lower lower threshold u heater u for heater when on u fan u for fan when on Output: u heater , out output u heater u fan , out output u fan 1: if lmv ⩽ t lower then 2: u heater , out ← u heater 3: else if lmv > t upper then 4: u fan , out ← u fan 5: end if 3.6 PID control In comparison to an ON/OFF controller, a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller is able to reduce oscillations around the setpoint by calculating the error between the measured signal and the desired reference value. PID control is based on the following equation: (1) u ( t ) = k p e ( t ) + k i ∫ 0 t e ( σ ) d σ + k d de ( t ) dt + b where e ( t ) is a continuous error value and k p , k i and k d are coefficients for the proportional, integral and derivative terms respectively and b is a bias. The input signals U_FAN and U_IR_HEATER for the fan and heater actuators are treated as one continuous signal in the range of - 255 < u < 255 . If the PID output is positive it is assigned to the respective U_IR_HEATER signal (with respective segment suffix), if it is negative it is multiplied by - 1 and assigned to the respective U_FAN signal. The LMV of the assigned segment is used to compute the current error and thus the current u. Algorithm2 shows the PID pseudocode for a single LMV value. Integral and derivative terms of the PID controller are discretized. Hence, the integral term becomes the sum of recorded errors while the derivative terms is defined as the delta between the current and previous error. Algorithm 2. PID controller pseudocode for one LMV value Input: lmv \u2013 a local mean vote for a body segment Output: u \u2013 u for local actuators 1: e ← 3 - lmv ▷ neutral LMV setting 2: e sum ← e sum + e 3: e Δ ← e - e prev 4: e prev ← e 5: b ← 0 ▷ Bias is zero 6: k p ← 0.3 ▷ Proportional gain 7: k i ← 0.5 ▷ Integral gain 8: k d ← 0.5 ▷ Derivative gain 9: u ← b + k p e + k i e sum + k d e delta ▷ Combined PID 3.7 MPC control An MPC controller is a more sophisticated method as ON/OFF or PID controllers because it uses an actual internal plant model of the system it controls based on an identified system. The MPC controller designed in this work uses a single input variable \u201cpower\u201d and a single measured output variable \u201cLMV\u201d. The sample time is one second which is equivalent to the sampling time of the system. The prediction horizon is set to 50 s while the control horizon is set to 2 s. The input is constrained between 0 and 255 and the minimum and maximum input change rate is −40 and 40 respectively. The identified system in Section 4.2 is used as internal plant model. The MPC uses a reference trajectory that it tries to mimic which in this experiment is simply set to a flat line at LMV = 3 . Similar to the ON/OFF and PID controllers, the U_FAN and U_IR signals are treated as one continuous signal - 255 < u < 255 . If the output is negative it is multiplied by −1 and set as U_FAN input signal. 4 Actuator control and tuning process Adequate control of infrared actuators and radial fans is a central aspect of this work. The thermal sensation/comfort models are used as controlled variables for the feedback controllers. The effectiveness of the system depends on the correct system identification and subsequent optimal controller tuning. Note that controllers can also be tuned manually through trial and error. Controller tuning determines the settling time as well as magnitude of overshoots which in turn directly impacts user comfort and power consumption. Three controller types are experimentally evaluated in this work: ON/OFF control, PID control and MPC. The experiments are conducted as follows: first a manually tuned PID controller is used to generate sufficient oscillations in order to identify the underlying system. The subsequent system identification generates a plant model in the form of a transfer function. The state space model is then used to tune the PID controller and the performance is compared with manually tuned PID controllers. The identified system is also used as the internal plant model of the MPC. The ON/OFF controller is parameterized manually. 4.1 Controller tuning setup The purpose of the actuator control experiments are to determine the best suitable control heuristic for thermal conditioning. In addition, the experiments provide information about suitable parameterization and allow formulation of a plant model for the interaction between actuator and skin surface. The experiments are conducted in an air conditioned room using the thermal manikin described in Section 2.2.4 (see Fig. 8 ). Focus was given to cool conditions because warm conditions are less prone to non-optimal controller configurations. Disturbances introduced by cooled beam air conditioning have far greater impact on controller performance, thus yielding more meaningful test results. In addition, under warm conditions preliminary tests showed that oscillation is lower and there is an overall faster convergence. The setpoint temperature for the cool condition was 16 ° C. 4.2 System identification The system of actuator interaction with the thermal manikin is identified using a suitable input/output dataset. The dataset is generated using a manually tuned P controller with k p = 300 . The setting provides overshoots and oscillation behavior which gives the system identification heuristic enough information to create a model with high confidence. The MATLAB system identification toolbox is used to estimate a transfer function model. The number of poles and zeros is set to 8. The model is trained as a discrete model with no direct feedthrough and a fixed I/O delay with a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 30 s. The model generated from the training datasets exhibits a goodness of fit value of 92.76 %, which is calculated using the NRMSE = RMSE x ¯ between the model predictions and the original data. This is a sufficiently accurate fit. Fig. 9 shows poles and zeros of the identified plant model where x and o denote the poles and zeros respectively. Since the identified model is a discrete-time system and all poles in the complex z-plane lie in the unit circle the system is stable. Note that this number of poles and zeros was chosen because it resulted in a high goodness of fit of the model to the data. We did not further investigate other configurations. 4.2.1 On/Off controller experiments Fig. 10 shows measurements of the ON/OFF controller experiments with settings u heater = u fan = 150 , u heater = u fan = 200 and u heater = u fan = 255 respectively. t lower and t upper are both set to the neutral LMV = 3. Hence, the deadband is equal to 0. Fig. 10a shows the controller is unable to reach the setpoint. After approximately 300 s it starts to converge to a steady state error of slightly less than one. Throughout the experiment the controller is in \u201con\u201d state since the LMV fails to reach the setpoint and the deadband is set to 0. This also explains why no oscillations occur in this measurement. Fig. 10b shows a measurement where the controller is able to reach the setpoint of LMV = 3. However, turning off the heater results in a rapid temperature and thus thermal comfort decline. It takes approximately 50 s for the controller to increase the LMV to the setpoint again which again results in the controller to be turned off thus repeating the cycle. The ON/OFF controller will keep oscillating indefinitely which again results in a steady state error. The results shown in Fig. 10c reveal a similar pattern. The higher power setting increases the amplitude and frequency of the oscillation, but does not prevent a steady state error. It can be concluded that a simple ON/OFF controller is insufficient for the task at hand because there is no configuration that can eliminate the steady state error. 4.2.2 PID controller tuning For testing purposes, the PID controller is tuned both manually and using the identified system 4.2. Controller A is tuned using the identified system with the following coefficients: k p = 92.681 , k i = 0.7235 , k d = 46.1596 . Controller B and C are tuned using preliminary observations as well as trial and error. They have coefficients k p = 50 , k i = 1 , k d = 2 and k p = 50 , k i = 1 , k d = 2 respectively. Fig. 11a, 11b, 11c and 11 d show controllers with only the P having a positive coefficient. It is immediately apparent that this configuration is insufficient for real world application and that the I and D terms are required as well. The controller in Fig. 11e has the lowest overshoot and settling time followed by controller Fig. 11f. Each controller reaches the setpoint after about 210 s and convergence after approx. 1000 s. The PID controller will continue to oscillate around the setpoint with low amplitude due to disturbances. 4.2.3 PID controller experiments Fig. 11a and 11b show controller measurements of P controllers with coefficients k p = 100 and k p = 200 respectively. It can be seen that in both cases the controller does not reach the neutral LMV setpoint because the proportional coefficient is too low. Instead, the measurements exhibit a steady state error of - 2 and - 1.7 respectively. Fig. 11a shows very little oscillation and minimal disturbance while Fig. 11b shows slightly higher disturbance, leading to oscillations. Fig. 11c and 11g show measurements with P coefficients k p = 300 and k p = 400 respectively. From this it can be seen that merely increasing the proportional coefficient of the controller does not eliminate the steady state error but merely increases the oscillations. Note that the dataset displayed in Fig. 11c was used as input dataset in order to identify the plant model (see Section 4.2). Fig. 11g\u2013i actual measurements using the control configurations from the simulation. The coefficients are k p = 92.681 , k i = 0.7235 , k d = 46.1596 , k p = 50 , k i = 1 , k d = 2 and k p = 100 , k i = 1 , k d = 10 respectively. It can be seen that in contrast to the simulation each controller performs similar when used to condition the manikin. Fig. 11h and 11i show a settling time after approximately 250 s. Fig. 11h and i show small overshoots at 220 and 400 s respectively which can be explained through disturbances by the chilled beam air conditioning. 4.2.4 MPC controller experiments The MPC method was not investigated in depth because it became apparent that it yields similar performances when compared to the PID controllers. The major drawback of the MPC method is that it is more complicated to set up while PID tuning is comparably simple. Hence, the PID was chosen as the preferable method for the task at hand (see Fig. 12 ). Settling time in the experiment is noticeably longer (approximately 500 s) in comparison to the PID controllers (approximately 200 s), however, the MPC is more stable when generating the power input variable for the actuators. All PID controllers obtain a slightly higher disturbance and oscillation after convergence. The MPC controller chosen for the experiment balances between robust and aggressive closed-loop performance which was experimentally tested to show in the best results. 5 User study Upon controller testing described before, the PID controller was chosen to be implemented in the subsequent user study to evaluate the entire system in human interaction. This includes thermographic skin temperature measurement with pose tracking, online thermal comfort model training as well as control of local heating and cooling actuators. The experiments are divided into a training and two control phases, dedicated to model training and evaluation, respectively (cf. Fig. 13 ). 5.1 Experimental setup The experimental setup of the user study is similar to the actuator control setup, see Fig. 8. The outlets of the HVAC system pointed towards the walls, and preliminary measurements ensured that the air velocity at the sitting position does not exceed 0.8 m/s ([16]). The Microsoft Kinect sensor is mounted at a height of approximately 1.2 m. The thermal camera is mounted on top of the Kinect with a vertical distance of 4 cm. Both cameras are aligned in parallel and tilted approximately 20 ° . The test subject sits in front of the cameras at a distance of about 1.5 m. The reference sensor for the thermal camera is placed to the left side of the test subject at approximately 3.0 m parallel distance to the cameras. The local air conditioning actuators are mounted at a height of 1.0 m and turned approximately 45 ° from the person\u2019s orthogonal viewing direction. The distance of the person from the actuators is approximately 0.3 m equivalent to the manikin in the actuator experiment. 5.2 User overview The user study was conducted using a convenience sample of male and female participants. Focus was given to a proof of principle test of the system, and generalizability across age groups or gender was not the primary scope of the current study. The sample consisted of eight Ph.D. and M.Sc. students from the Faculty of Civil Engineering. Table 2 shows the user IDs along with basic demographic characteristics of the sample. 5.3 Procedure Before participation, users were asked to rest in a neutral thermal environment (21\u201322 ° C) for about 30 min as a preparation before entering the experimental procedure (cf. Fig. 13). Each phase lasted 30 min, the total duration was 90 min. Users manually initialize the next phases after a previous phase is concluded. During the first (training) phase, subjects provide subjective thermal comfort assessments approximately every three minutes. One assessment consists of a complete iteration through all segments including the global rating including an assessment for local thermal sensation (LS) and thermal comfort (LC) for each body segment as well as the overall thermal sensation (OS) and the overall thermal comfort (OC). The training phase (TP) is used to train all modifiable user models: Monte Carlo (MC), decision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM) and multilayer perceptron (MLP). During the training phase the room is heated using floor positioned fan heaters for the first 10 min (not to be confused with local actuators). The heaters are turned off after 10 min and for the remaining 20 min the chilled beam HVAC cooling is activated to reduce the room temperature. Here, the HVAC setpoint is set to 16 ° C. By transitioning between heating and cooling of the room a large room temperature range is obtained that gives a great variety of thermal sensation and thermal comfort assessments, allowing to investigate the system in a larger temperature range and whether it is able to reinstate thermal comfort even if the temperatures deviate strongly from the comfort zone. Local actuators are turned off during the training phase. The purpose of the remaining two phases (CPq and CP2) is to gain insight into how the trained models perform when applied to actuator control. During the phases local actuators are turned on and consecutively assigned to trained models. The assigned model is switched every six minutes in order to generate comparable measurements (see Fig. 13). During CP1 the chilled beam cooling stays activated and during CP2 the HVAC system is turned off and the floor fan heaters are turned on again. Hence, CP1 tests model performance under cool conditions and CP2 tests performance under warm room conditions. 5.4 User sensation and comfort The user study was designed to cover a large range of skin temperatures during the 30 min training phase. This is important because the amount of collected training data is relatively low and models need a possibly wide skin temperature range in order to be able to interpolate. While data density also contributes to better models, quality and range of data determine model quality to a larger extent. When analyzing local and overall comfort and sensation votes (Fig. 14 a\u2013d), it can be seen that during TP WARM and CP2 combined mean LS and OS votes are higher than during TP COOL and CP1. The combined mean LC and OC show the same trend. It can also be seen that during CP1 negative LS/OS and LC/OC cannot be eliminated by local actuator heating. For TP WARM the combined mean LS lies between neutral and slightly warm. The combined LC mean lies close to slightly comfortable. The combined mean OS lies between neutral and slightly warm while the combined mean OC lies between slightly comfortable and comfortable. It can be concluded that users in TP WARM are generally in a comfortable state. During this phase the chilled beam HVAC system and local actuators are turned off. Floor fan heaters are turned on. All LC segment means (mean of all users for a particular segment) lie between 0.8 and 1.54 ( 0.1 = slightly comfortable , 2 = comfortable ). Note that all min/max values are averages of all segments as well. The combined mean for the comfort and sensation metrics for TP COOL are as follows: LS between slightly cool and cool, LC between slightly uncomfortable and uncomfortable, OS between slightly cool and cool and OC between slightly comfortable and uncomfortable. The thermal sensation and comfort during the cool part of the training phase is influenced by the decreased room temperature and, in addition, by the chilled beam HVAC draft. The HEAD, FACE and BACK segments obtain a mean LC between slightly comfortable and comfortable ( M LC = 0.31, 0.31, 0.23). All other segments have a combined mean of less or equal to 0. The arm segments are especially affected by the cold. The reason is likely that the users are asked to pull up their sleeves and the skin is directly affected by the draft from the ceiling mounted HVAC system. The combined means during CP 1 are: LS between neutral and cool, LC between slightly uncomfortable and uncomfortable, OS between neutral and cool and OC between slightly comfortable and slightly uncomfortable. The Zhang model obtains overall highest LS/LC/OS/OC while the decision tree obtains the lowest. The reason for the better performance of the Zhang model compared to the models that are generated bottom up is that the trained models are slightly biased towards predicting warm sensations. This is because the users gave thermal comfort sensations that are skewed towards feeling warm during TP WARM and too little cool sensations are acquired during TP COOL. The resulting zero crossing of the models on average is lower than in the original Zhang model. Hence, the models require a lower skin temperature to predict a cool thermal sensation that the actuators can compensate. 5.5 Power consumption In order to assess the overall energy performance, a Sonoff Smart Power Switch measured the mean power consumption for each phase of the user study (15). The training phase is omitted since actuators are turned off, and power consumption of electronic control devices was omitted. From Fig. 15 a it can be seen that ZH consumes the most and SVM consumes the least amount of power during CP1 respectively. ZH consumes the most and MC consumes the least amount of power during CP2 respectively. Fig. 15b show the mean power consumption for each individual user in order to assess the influence of user training on power consumption. User 5061ba38 consumes the least amount of power (0.05 kW) and user 2b7419ba consumes the most (0.2 kW). Note that the fans consume only a fraction of the power of the infrared heater power consumption (less than 2 W per fan as opposed to a maximum of 150 W per infrared heater). Hence during the warm phase less power is consumed by the infrared heaters and, even at full speed the fans do not consume a significant amount of power. 5.6 Limitations of the experimental study SVM and MLP are flexible algorithms that behave differently depending on which kernel (SVM) or activation function (MLP) is selected. In this work, the RBF kernel and the logistic activation function were used for the SVM and MLP respectively. Choosing, for example, a polynomial kernel or rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function may yield very different results. Moreover, completely different architectures are possible and should be evaluated in future studies. For example, it is possible to represent all body segments in a single deep neural network, possibly with additional thermophysiological input nodes and additional subjective output nodes. 6 Discussion 6.1 System design This work introduced a modular system for the evaluation of personalized thermal conditioning systems and the control algorithms used for these systems. An important system feature is the communication over a centralized server using common HTTP and REST APIs. Additionally, the first results of human subject studies showed that automated experiment timing and guidance for the participants can greatly improve the workflow and subsequent data quality. 6.2 User comfort The user study showed to which degree the system is capable of substituting uncomfortable ambient temperatures. During the cool phase (16 ° C room temperature), the system was only able to maintain comfort for some body segments. There are two main reasons: first, there are only two local actuators for the upper part of the body. A system for real world application would require more actuators so that each body segment can be sufficiently conditioned. Second, the models trained with user data were slightly biased toward predicting warm thermal comfort sensations. Prolonged training periods and additional sensor information are likely to improve prediction quality. During the warm phase, thermal comfort was maintained by all models. Here, the system does not reach capacity limits and does not have to work against the draft of the HVAC system\u2019s chilled beam. Among the control strategies tested, the PID works well to keep the skin temperature neutral by balancing fans and infrared heaters. 6.3 Prediction accuracy In order to assess prediction accuracy, RMSE and R 2 metrics were used. The calculated RMSE was generally in the range 1 to 1.5 for the LS scale and 1 to 2 for the LC scale. Note that the step size for the LC scale is 2 and hence increases the resulting RMSE. Sensation and thermal comfort values for segments seen by the thermal camera generally obtain better prediction accuracy than segments where skin temperature is simulated. Model correlation is better during CP2 (warm phase) since users vote closer to the model zero crossing. The reason here is that the model zero crossing is generally accurate. Model inaccuracy is mostly focused on regions farer away from the neutral point. 6.4 Power consumption Power consumption is more influenced through individual user training than through specific model type. While there are differences in model quality (e.g. the MLP can create nonlinear regression models while DT creates piecewise linear functions) this only marginally influences power consumption. User training on the other hand can shift the entire model towards predicting warmer or cooler thermal sensation and thermal comfort which greatly impacts power consumption as the controller needs to compensate by increased cooling or heating respectively. In practice, the system could impose limits on power consumption and provide rich visual information about the model bias, acceptable range of the individual user and possible improvements for power consumption. In the present study, the energy consumption of the central HVAC system was not monitored, so that the energy use cannot be compared directly to potential savings due to localized climatization. This is a major aim in the subsequent studies. Lastly, the presented combination of sensors, actuators, and control strategies and algorithms need to be more exhaustive in future studies. Especially Bayesian approaches appear to be highly suitable for controlling and optimizing HVAC systems [4,5]; for a recent review of Machine Learning applications in the whole building life-cycle see also Hong et al. [15]. 7 Conclusion In this paper, we described a modular testing system to evaluate local climatization components and control algorithms. The testing system is able to compare Machine Learning and PID control approaches concurrently, integrate user feedback elicited with the help of a dedicated smartphone app, and assist the researcher in visualizing as well as saving data from the actuators\u2019 energy consumption, thermal imaging, model performance and feedback collected via the smartphone app. We experimentally evaluated the use of thermal comfort models trained using online machine learning as predictors for controllers of local climatization actuators. Sample sizes, experimental design, and general research settings are to be sharpened and elaborated in the future, yet, we demonstrated that an integrative, modular system can integrate sensors, actuators, and thermal images data for evaluation purposes. Due to the modular structure and open communication protocols, individual hard- or software components can be changed and manipulated without the need to restructure the whole system.

        "dc:description": "Modern air conditioning makes up a large part of global energy consumption. HVAC systems are the most energy consuming devices in the building sector and also contribute to greenhouse gas emission in the transportation sector when used for vehicle cabin climatization. Conventional HVAC systems are designed to heat or cool air volumes of entire rooms or zones. A much more efficient way is to condition a person directly by generating a microclimate around the body through the use of local conditioning actuators taking into account the respective individual\u2019s preference. This work proposes a so called personalized thermal conditioning testing system which offers a server based, modular platform to test actuators, control strategies and facilitate monitoring and data collection. The focus of this work lies in the evaluation of control algorithms and machine learning heuristics that are used to train individual thermal comfort models used to adapt the system\u2019s actuators to user preferences. Specifically, the control methods ON/OFF, Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) and Model predictive control (MPC) are compared. Monte Carlo sampling, regression tree, support-vector machine and multilayer perceptron heuristics are assessed as machine learning techniques for individual model training. A brief introduction of the modular system architecture is given, and results from a controller experiment and preliminary user study are presented. The system was able to successfully train and compare control and machine learning algorithms in real-time, and to integrate sensors, actuators, as well as skin temperature measurement with a thermal camera.",
