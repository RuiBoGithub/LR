Graphical abstract The space conditioning of buildings is liable for more than 10 % of World final energy uses and related CO2-eq emissions. Such share must be drastically reduced to pursue sustainability by optimizing both energy design and devices control. In this frame, space cooling is assuming an increasing weight owing to climate change. Accordingly, this study applies a simulation- and optimization-based framework for the model predictive control (MPC) of space cooling systems. The case study is a nearly zero energy building located in Benevento \u2013 Southern Italy, Mediterranean climate \u2013 featuring an efficient air-source multi-split system for cooling. The framework is envisioned to provide optimal values of setpoint temperatures on a day-ahead planning horizon to minimize energy cost and thermal discomfort, based on weather forecasts. Accordingly, a Pareto multi-objective approach is applied considering different discomfort indicators to compare the Fanger theory with the adaptive one of ASHRAE 55. The optimization problem is solved by running a genetic algorithm \u2013 variant of NSGA II \u2013 under MATLAB® environment. The objective functions are assessed via the coupling between MATLAB® and EnergyPlus, using a validated building energy model. The multi-criteria decision-making is performed by setting a limit to discomfort to pick an optimal Pareto solution. The framework is tested addressing a typical day of the cooling season and using monitored weather data to simulate weather forecasts. Different optimal solutions are provided to fit different comfort categories. Compared to a reference control at fixed setpoint \u2013 26 °C \u2013 the proposed solutions with similar comfort performance ensure cost savings around 28 %. Besides the proposed hypothetical implementation, the framework can be integrated in automation systems for real-time MPC. The novel contributions of this study lie in the methodology to combine MPC with different thermal comfort models as well as in the results, which provide deeps insights about the application of MPC for the space cooling of nearly zero energy buildings in a balanced climate.

In the European Union (EU), buildings account for around 40 % of energy consumption and 36 % of greenhouse gas emissions [2], which are linked to construction, use/operation, retrofit and demolition [3]. Similarly, at the World level, in 2020, the building sector accounted for about 36 % of energy consumption, with a share of around 35 % for space conditioning [4]. In this frame, globally, HVAC systems are liable for over 10 % of final energy uses and related CO2-eq emissions. Thus, enhancing the energy efficiency of such systems plays a pivotal role in pursuing the carbon-neutrality by 2050, target set out by the European Green Deal to fight climate change and to ensure sustainable development [3]. Through research projects and grants policies, the EU is investing in smart meters and digital tools to optimize the control of energy systems. About such a research field, nowadays, there are advanced management strategies for HVAC systems, e.g., model predictive control (MPC) ones. MPC is becoming an established technology in control and automation of HVAC plants [5]. It is based on a building model to achieve energy load predictions as a function of weather forecasts and building use. Such predictions are handled to optimize the control actions in order to minimize/maximize one or more objective functions, while taking into account comfort, cost and technological constraints within a systematic and flexible framework [6,7]. A proper implementation of MPC requires consistent definitions of control/planning horizon, prediction horizon and sampling time. These factors can highly affect computational efforts, rejection capability of disturbance factors, stability and setting time of controllers [8]. The most popular applications employ deterministic models \u2013 i.e., based on physical laws to simulate building energy performance \u2013 because this approach ensures good trade-off between computational complexity and reliability, even if it may imply cost degradation [9,10]. Model predictive controllers can be a pivotal solution to increase energy efficiency for both newly-built and existing buildings. Notably, thanks to continuous technological development and digital transition, MPC is becoming a market-ready and technically mature solution to promote the energy renovation process of existing HVAC systems, implying huge energy savings \u2013 up to 50 % in particular cases \u2013 with low payback times [11]. The recent scientific literature proposes sundry studies unveiling the advantages of MPC in building applications, as shown by the comprehensive review of Yao and Shekhar [8]. The available studies usually indicate that the adoption of this technique can provide energy savings and improvement of thermal comfort. Yang et al. [12] experimentally tested a MPC system in the campus of Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. They achieved a decrease in cooling energy demand of around 58.5 % for an office, and a decrease in HVAC electricity consumption around 36.7 % for a lecture theatre, compared to the original rule-based control strategies. Mork et al. [13] numerically found that distributed MPC can reduce thermal discomfort by 65 % and energy consumption by 7.6 % compared to a rule-based control. Lee et al. [14], addressing a residential unit in the Republic of Korea via simulations, showed that a MPC framework, compared to a simple on/off thermostat, can achieve heating energy savings up to 12 %, or reduction of comfort violation less than 0.5 °C. Hou et al. [15] proposed an error model to improve MPC prediction performance under uncertainty in weather forecasts. The model was tested by simulations on a university building located in Norway, yielding energy cost savings around 3.4 % and a reduction of temperature violation numbers around 73 %, compared to a standard rule-based control. Li and Wang [16] provided a comparative assessment of alternative MPC strategies and interesting insights for optimal use in buildings. A novel economic MPC setup was developed by Knudsen et al. [17] and applied to a highly insulated single-family house in Norway. The setup was able to achieve significant demand response potentials, related to the exploitation of building thermal mass. De Lorenzi et al. [18] proposed an innovative smart controller prototype for small-scale district heating networks, which was tested on real case studies. Compared to standard rule-based control approaches, energy savings up to 34 % were attained while keeping the same comfort level. Freud et al. [19] applied a MPC framework in a building section hosting the two local ministries for energy & environment and urban development in Hamburg, Germany. During a three-month testing from February to April 2020, they found that heating energy consumption in the model-predictive-controlled section was lower by around 30 % compared to the traditionally-controlled sections, while keeping the same level of thermal comfort. Salakij et al. [20] applied a finite horizon linear quadratic tracking to optimize setpoint temperatures, achieving thermal energy savings up to 43 % compared with a fixed setpoint temperature control. Accordingly, Ławryńczuk et al. [21] compared MPC with a fixed setpoint temperature and MPC with a setpoint optimizer, finding that the setpoint decrement from 21 °C to 18.5 °C leads to reducing the energy demand by around 1430 kWh during the heating season. Bianchini et al. [22] proposed a MPC system integrating a centralized HVAC plant, photovoltaics, thermal and electric storage, achieving energy cost savings of around 25.5 % compared to a standard rule-based control. Aftab et al. [23] developed an automatic HVAC control framework integrating real-time occupancy detection, dynamic occupancy predictions, and simulation-based MPC, which yielded energy savings higher than 30 % while ensuring acceptable comfort levels. Kumar et al. [24] compared stochastic and deterministic MPC for a university campus, showing that the former provides total cost savings up to 7.5 %, reducing electricity (by 6.9 %) and natural gas consumption (by 8.6 %), as well as peak loads (by 29.8 %). Avci et al. [25] proposed a cost-effective and energy-efficient MPC strategy under real-time electricity pricing, unveiling substantial energy savings compared with a fixed setpoint strategy. Recent studies combined MPC with advanced multi-objective optimization algorithms in order to maximize energy efficiency and thermal comfort. For instance, Du et al. [26] proposed a novel regulation and control method integrating MPC and a multi-objective genetic algorithm to attain reasonable dynamic operation strategies of HVAC systems for large multi-regional public buildings in Hohhot, Inner Mongolia, achieving energy savings higher than 10 % without penalizing thermal comfort. Definitely, MPC potentials are huge for both newly-built and existing buildings. In the former cases, efficient and smart controllers are fundamental to \u201cnot waste\u201d the optimized energy design of the building-plants system, and to really achieve low- or zero-energy performance. In the latter case, potentials are even larger, since often existing buildings operate with rude HVAC regulation strategies, such as at fixed setpoint, implying substantial energy savings. Definitely, the potential energy savings depend on the baseline, and can vary between 10 % and 50 % at equal comfort conditions. However, the prediction of energy loads is a critical issue when it comes to develop controllers for heating and cooling systems, especially as regards MPC, which needs reliable predictions of building performance. A solution can be the implementation of simplified building energy models. Accordingly, Cholewa et al. [27] proposed an original simplified but accurate method for short-term forecasting of heat power demand as a function of local outdoor weather conditions (i.e., temperature, wind speed and solar radiation). The method is based on multiple linear regression applied to monitored data, and provides coefficients of determination around 0.9 for three real buildings in Lublin, Poland, with different use destinations (i.e., a multifamily residential building, a health clinic, and a supermarket) and heating systems. The method was updated to take into account also occupant behavior as input variable [28], and integrated in an easy and widely applicable MPC system (forHEAT) for space heating operation of existing and new buildings [29], based on the forecasts of weather parameters. This system was installed and tested in a multi-family building and an office building located in Lublin, Poland, reaching energy savings around 15.2 % and 24.1 %, respectively. Another cutting-edge and promising solution for load forecasting within MPC frameworks can be machine learning, which implementation is rapidly escalating in the building filed thanks to the increasing opportunities in collecting and processing building data. Accordingly, Yang et al. [30] proposed an approximate MPC framework using a nonlinear autoregressive network trained with measured data, addressing the case studies of [12], i.e., an office and a lecture theater in Singapore. For the office, the MPC and approximate MPC cut 58.5 % and 51.6 % of cooling energy consumption, respectively, compared to the original control, while for the lecture theatre, the savings were about 36.7 % and 36.2 %, respectively. The adoption of an artificial neural network-based model predictive control for a residential house located in Ontario was investigated in [31] and compared to a fixed setpoint strategy, showing that MPC was able to save operating costs between 6 % and 73 % depending on the season. In the same vein, machine learning was applied to occupancy-based HVAC control systems in residential buildings, showing the significant impact of occupancy forecast models on controller performance [32]. Very recent studies combined machine learning and multi-objective numerical optimization to fully exploit MPC potentials, e.g., energy savings up to 58 % [33], and to extract interpretable building control rules [34]. 1.1 Aim of this study The literature review indicates that the development of MPC strategies for reducing energy consumption and running cost of HVAC systems is a central topic of present and future research. The potential energy savings can be higher than 50 % while maintaining or even improving thermal comfort. Thus, MPC can be a precious tool to optimize the energy performance of both newly-built and existing buildings, generally with low investments and payback times because the application of such strategies could require not-expensive software and hardware equipment. The major investment lies in the development of effective MPC frameworks, easy to be applied to real buildings. Several case studies have been addressed for different building types, using different numerical methods for making simulations/predictions and solving the optimization problems. In this frame, the present work proposes a hypothetical implementation of a simulation- and optimization-based framework for the MPC of space cooling systems. The case study is an existing nearly zero energy building (nZEB) located in Benevento \u2013 South Italy. The framework implements a Pareto multi-objective approach to minimize energy cost and thermal discomfort, considering different comfort indicators. The optimization problem is solved by running a genetic algorithm \u2013 variant of NSGA II [35] \u2013 under MATLAB® environment. As shown by the reviewed studies, simulation- and optimization-based MPC to minimize both energy consumption and discomfort is not a novelty. However, as per the authors\u2019 knowledge, there are research gaps concerning the application of such MPC frameworks to space cooling systems, investigating different thermal comfort models within a Pareto optimization framework. This can be crucial to answer important research questions when implementing multi-objective MPC of space cooling, i.e.,: \u2022 Which are the potential energy and cost savings provided by optimal trade-off (Pareto non-dominated) solutions for different comfort categories? \u2022 Which are the differences in the results between the Fanger theory and the adaptive comfort one? \u2022 Can a correspondence between such theories be found? \u2022 Which is the comfort theory that enables to exploit MPC benefits the most? This paper tries to answer such questions, thus the main innovation lies in the following points: \u2022 a novel regulation of controlled parameters is presented for the cooling season. The optimized values of controlled parameters are obtained by considering and comparing two different approaches to the thermal comfort: the well-known semi-static theory proposed by Fanger and the adaptive one of ASHRAE 55 [36]; \u2022 the dynamic temperature setpoint regulation model on-demand level is established based on a multi-objective optimization method, which can reduce the cooling demand while ensuring the thermal comfort and the minimum exercise cost. The multi-criteria decision-making is performed by setting a limit to discomfort to pick an optimal solution from the Pareto front, providing \u2013 as novel contribution \u2013 different trade-off optimal solutions to fit different comfort categories related to different comfort theories; \u2022 the model predictive control concept is applied to a nZEB in a Mediterranean climate for verifying the further possible efficiency increase in a building designed to have very low energy requirements in such climatic conditions. The building model is calibrated and validated against monitored data and the application of the MPC framework is simulated for a typical day of the cooling season. 2 Materials and methods This section elucidates the addressed case study, the building energy model, and the applied simulation- and optimization-based framework for the model predictive control of the space cooling system. 2.1 Case study The BNZEB (Fig. 1 ) is a nearly zero energy building (nZEB) designed and built in Benevento (BN) in the frame of the Italian project \u201cSMARTCASE\u201d (code PON03PE_00093_1) \u2013 European Regional Development Found. Benevento is a middle-size city in Southern Italy with a typical Mediterranean climate (Italian climatic zone C, 1316 heating degree days at baseline 20 °C). The last summer (2021) has been characterized by a maximum temperature higher than 38 °C, with average daily values very often higher than 30 °C. The situation is not better during the ongoing summer 2022. January and February are usually the coldest months with a minimum temperature of around 0 °C. A detailed description of the technical solutions concerning BNZEB design has been already proposed by Ascione et al. [37], however for improving the readability of the paper the main information is here summarized. The building net conditioned area is around 70 m2, the window/wall ratio is 22.5 % and the surface-to-volume ratio is 1.03 m−1. The structural frame is in cross laminated wood with two layers of fiber-wood insulation. The measured thermal transmittance (U) values of thermal envelope components are 0.19 W/m2K for the external walls, 0.22 W/m2K for the roof, 0.79 W/m2K for the internal walls. Windows are double-glazed with low-emissivity coatings and PVC frame, resulting in a U-value of 1.5 W/m2K. The space conditioning system consists of two alternative options, installed for testing purposes: i. an efficient air-source multi-split system, with heating and cooling capacity of 3.50 kW, heating COP (coefficient of performance) of 3.45, cooling EER (energy efficiency ratio) of 4.78; ii. a packaged air system, with an air-to-air reversible heat pump, which can be used for heating, cooling, dehumidification, and mechanical ventilation, with heating capacity and COP equal to 3.18 kW and 3.83 respectively, cooling capacity and EER equal to 2.14 kW and 2.95, respectively. 100 m long horizontal geothermal probes at a depth of 2.0 m are used to pre-heat or pre-cool the ventilation air. The first option is activated in this study because it represents the most popular space cooling system for residential buildings, without precise control of ventilation and latent heat load. A 2.16 m2 solar thermal collector is used to produce domestic hot water and to pre-heat the ventilation air. Finally, a photovoltaic (PV) system with 16 monocrystalline silicon panels (peak power of 330 W for each one) is installed on the roof. The PV modules are South-oriented with a tilt angle of 5° in order to achieve the best trade-off of power/producibility, minimization of mutual shading, and visual impact. The system is equipped with a 6.5 kWh lithium battery. The energy converted by renewables does not affect the results of this study, reported in section 3, because the focus is on electricity demand for space cooling. 2.2 Building energy model: Development and validation Ascione et al. [38] already presented the development and validation of the numerical model of the BNZEB considering the packaged air system for HVAC. Briefly, DesignBuilder® was used for the graphical construction (Fig. 2 ) and the building model was simulated via EnergyPlus [39]. Particularized data concerning thermal envelope and windows, lighting systems, and air conditioning systems were included, by considering all features of fans and pumps. Also, the renewable energy source systems were properly modeled. For the purpose of this paper, the model has been modified considering the real occupation, equipment pattern, weather data, and the activation of the multi-split system for space conditioning, without taking into account energy conversion from renewables. At this aim, a monitoring campaign was done during the period July 21\u201328, 2021. During this week, using the BNZEB monitoring system detailed in [38], the following parameters have been recorded with a continuous time-step of 15 min: electric consumption, disaggregated for type (lighting, air-conditioning, equipment), outdoor conditions, indoor air temperature and relative humidity. The monitored weather data have been used to define a weather file for EnergyPlus simulations in real conditions. About the occupants\u2019 behavior during the indicated week, from 9:00 to 17:00, three students occupied the building. More in detail: \u2022 on 21st and 26th July, passive approach: the space cooling system was always turned on with a fixed setpoint (26 °C); the windows were closed without the adoption of indoor shading devices, the artificial lighting system was turned off and the internal loads consisted only of personal computers; \u2022 on 22nd and 27th July, semi-active approach: the space cooling system was always turned on with a fixed setpoint (26 °C), free opening of windows and adoption of shading devices, as well as free schedule for artificial lighting system and electric equipment (personal computers, television, kitchen devices); \u2022 on 23rd and 28th July, active approach: similar to the previous one but the setpoint temperature was dynamic and freely selected by the occupants. Two days for each approach have been considered for redundancy. The EnergyPlus models have been calibrated by acting on setpoint values and schedules of indoor temperature, infiltration and ventilation (windows opening) rates, use of shading systems, and internal loads due to electrical equipment. In order to perform the calibration procedure, the outputs of EnergyPlus simulations have been compared with monitored data (both consumption and indoor parameters) following the approach proposed by ASHRAE 14 Guideline [40]. The considered indices have been: MBE (mean bias error) and CV(RMSE) (coefficient of variation of the root mean squared error); the admitted thresholds, when hourly data are used, are ± 10 % and 30 %, respectively [40]. The comparison between the measured hourly values of electricity consumption for space cooling and the outputs of the calibrated EnergyPlus models is reported in Tab. I, Tab.2 and Tab. 3 for the passive (21st July), semi-active (27th July), and active (28th July) approaches, respectively. The tables also report the values of MBE and CV(RMSE) which fall within the mentioned admitted ASHRAE thresholds. Similar values of such indices \u2013 complying with the thresholds \u2013 have been achieved also for the other days. Therefore, the EnergyPlus models can be considered validated and well-representing the real energy performance of the building. Thus, they can be used in the MPC optimization framework as a prediction tool. Notably, the passive approach is assumed in the application of the framework (see section 3) for testing purposes. In this regard, the results in Tables 1-3 show that \u2013 moving from the passive approach to the active one \u2013 electricity consumption for space cooling tends to increase, even if the weather conditions in these days were very similar. This is mainly due to setpoint temperature variation \u2013 based on occupants\u2019 preferences \u2013, free opening of windows and free use of electric equipment (higher internal loads). Therefore, MPC potentials can be even higher if compared to a baseline characterized by an \u201cactive\u201d occupants\u2019 behavior. Accordingly, a passive approach is here assumed to model the baseline for simplification reasons and for avoiding to overrate the benefits \u2013 in terms of energy savings \u2013 produced by the MPC. 2.3 Model predictive control optimization framework A simulation- and optimization-based framework for the model predictive control (MPC) of space conditioning systems is applied. The framework is an enhancement of the version proposed by some of the authors in [41], and compared to this latter it offers the following upgrades: \u2022 it is applied to space cooling systems addressing a real building; \u2022 it investigates different thermal comfort indicators to compare the semi-static Fanger theory with the adaptive one of ASHRAE 55 [36] in order to achieve different optimal solutions fitting different comfort categories, providing deep insights about the correlation between thermal comfort and energy consumption/cost. The framework \u2013 sketched in Fig. 3 \u2013 is envisioned to provide optimal values of cooling setpoint temperatures (Tsp) on a day-ahead planning horizon to minimize energy cost and thermal discomfort, based on weather forecasts, using a Pareto multi- (i.e., two-) objective approach. As argued in [41], the adoption of a 24-hour day-ahead planning horizon means that in real-time applications within a building automation system, the optimization procedure should be run every day (assessment day) to optimize the control strategy for the following day (application day). Thus, the size of the planning horizon is fixed, i.e., 24 h, but it is receding since it progressively moves from one day to the next. In this regard, the minimization of the computational time required by the optimization process is fundamental, and it will be addressed in future studies as discussed in the Conclusions. For instance, if such a time is lower than 1 h, the procedure can be implemented at 23:00 of the assessment day, when the weather forecasts for the application day are more accurate. Otherwise, if it is higher, the procedure must be implemented earlier, and this can affect weather forecast reliability. Notably, the use of a day-ahead planning horizon is suggested in different studies, e.g., [42,43], because it provides a good trade-off between forecast reliability and computational burden [41]. It is more effective than shorter ones as long as it enables to maximize the use of the building thermal mass [44,45], and to achieve optimal solutions by constraining the maximum daily operation of HVAC systems [41], which is restricted in some countries (e.g., in Italy for space heating). On the other hand, it is better than longer horizons because it ensures more reliable weather forecasts. In addition, such a planning horizon is particularly effective when the thermal inertia of the building-HVAC system is not considerable, e.g., in the addressed case study characterized by lightweight construction and air-based cooling system, thereby impeding to exploit thermal buffers for next days. Definitely, the methodology needs to be enhanced to take into account unexpected changes in weather forecasts, but this point needs further investigation. The design variables are the 24-hourly values of Tsp in the building during the application day. Each variable can vary in a discrete range, i.e., in this study the following one (8 values per variable) is used, typical of cooling operation in residential buildings: (1) Tsp ( ° C ) ∈ 24 , 24.5 , 25 , 25.5 , 26 , 26.5 , 27 , 50 system s w i t c h e d o f f It is assumed that Tsp is the same in the whole building being a small construction, but different Tsp values could be considered in different thermal zones when larger buildings are addressed. The solution domain is therefore composed of 8^24 = 4.722e + 21 solutions. As clear, a brute-force (i.e., exhaustive) search is unfeasible from a computational viewpoint making unavoidable the implementation of a proper optimization algorithm. The first objective function is the daily energy cost for space cooling per unit of conditioned area, denoted with CC, while different discomfort indicators are used as second objective function: \u2022 PPDmax: maximum daily value of the predicted percentage of dissatisfied assessed according to the Fanger theory (PPD) \u2013 optimization 1; \u2022 PPDmean: mean daily value of PPD \u2013 optimization 2; \u2022 DHashrae: daily percentage of discomfort hours (over 24 h) assessed according to the adaptive comfort theory of ASHRAE 55 [36] considering a 90 % acceptability status, as recommended for high performance buildings; the reference is to ASHRAE guidelines, being a well-accredited standard at international level \u2013 optimization 3. For PPD assessment, the clothing thermal resistance is set equal to 0.0775 m2K/W (=0.5 clo) as typical of the summer season [36], while the metabolic rate is set equal to 120 W/person (around 1.15 met assuming a body mean surface area of 1.8 m2) that is typical of sedentary activity and standing at rest. Notably, this latter value has been calibrated in order to achieve the best fitting between simulated PMV values and occupants\u2019 perceptions during the monitoring campaign cited in section 2.2. These two parameters are considered constant throughout the day because the clothing resistance does not undergo significant daily changes in summertime (while it can drastically increase during nights in wintertime because of heavy blankets), and the metabolic rate does not undergo substantial daily changes in residential buildings, which generally host sedentary activity or resting/sleeping. Actually, during summer nights, the clothing resistance tends to slightly increase because of light bed sheets, while the metabolic rate decreases, but it is assumed that such variations compensate each other. Different indicators are investigated to compare different comfort theories and to achieve insights about thermal comfort. The optimization problem is solved for each couple of objective functions (all of them to be minimized) \u2013 i.e., CC vs PPDmax, CC vs PPDmean, CC vs DHashrae \u2013 by running a variant of the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) [35], under MATLAB® [46] environment. EnergyPlus [39] is used as building simulation tool and it is automatically coupled with MATALAB® as detailed in [41]. The genetic algorithm (GA) is a numerical, semi-heuristic, semi-stochastic, and population-based optimization method, which simulates the \u201cDarwinian\u201d evolution of a population of solutions, called \u201cindividuals\u201d, through a series of iterations, called \u201cgenerations\u201d, via the processes of creation, selection, crossover and mutation. Details about the algorithm are available in [41]. Each design variable is encoded by a string of 3 bits, so that it can assume one of the 8 (=2^3) values reported in (1). Therefore, each solution is encoded by 3*24 = 72 bits. The proper setting of GA parameters is fundamental to achieve a fast convergence, which is essential in MPC applications because the computational time required by the optimization process should be lower than the planning horizon. In this regard, the population size is set equal to 144 (twice the number of bits) and the maximum number of generations equal to 100. Furthermore, a kind of convergence analysis is implemented, as shown in section 3.1, to see how the Pareto front changes as a function of the number of generations. Such an analysis can be useful to understand if fewer generations can be sufficient to reach consistent suboptimal solutions. In order to achieve a further decrease of the computational times, the minimum running period (tmin ) introduced in [41] is used in EnergyPlus simulations. It represents the minimum number of days that should be covered by dynamic energy simulations for achieving reliable results. The tmin value achieved in [41] for a similar case study is equal to 10 days. Here the running period is set equal to 20 days to be on the safe side. Therefore, EnergyPlus dynamic simulations do not start from 1st January but from 20 days before the day of application of the MPC strategy. Adopting such an expedient, the simulation time for each solution, as concerns the addressed case study, is around 18.4 s using a processor Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-9700KF. Therefore, the maximum computational time required by the whole optimization process is equal to: (2) ( m a x i m u m n u m b e r o f g e n e r a t i o n s ) x population s i z e x single s i m u l a t i o n t i m e = 100 x 144 x 18.4 s = 73.6 h This value is higher compared to the planning horizon (24 h), and therefore it needs to be further reduced for real applications of the proposed framework in building automation systems, as discussed in section 4. At the end of the optimization, the GA provides the Pareto front, which collects the non-dominated solutions. Hence, the multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) is performed by setting a limit to the discomfort objective function and selecting the solution that complies with such a constant and minimizes CC (see Fig. 3). Different limit values are investigated in section 3 to provide different optimal solutions, fitting the following comfort categories of SFS-EN 15251 [47]: \u2022 comfort category II (PPD ≤ 10 %): \u201cNormal level of expectation and should be used for new buildings and renovations\u201d; \u2022 comfort category III (PPD ≤ 15 %): \u201cAn acceptable, moderate level of expectation and may be used for existing buildings\u201d. The comfort category I of SFS-EN 15251 is not considered because it refers to particular cases, i.e., \u201cHigh level of expectation and is recommended for spaces occupied by very sensitive and fragile persons with special requirements like handicapped, sick, very young children and elderly persons\u201d. Notably, the optimal scenarios reported in Table 4 are identified and investigated. Each scenario is associated with one of the mentioned comfort categories: \u2022 the two scenarios related to optimization 1 \u2013 i.e., a) and b) \u2013 strictly respect the associated comfort category because the PPD is always lower than the limit (10 % and 15 % for categories II and III, respectively), given that the addressed discomfort objective function is the maximum daily value of PPD; \u2022 the two scenarios related to optimization 2 \u2013 i.e., c) and d) \u2013 refer to \u201crelaxed\u201d comfort categories, because the mean daily value of PPD is considered, and therefore the hourly PPD value can violate such a limit; \u2022 as concerns the two scenarios related to optimization 3 \u2013 i.e., e) and f) \u2013 the considered 90 % acceptability status of ASHRAE 55 [36] generally corresponds to PPD ≤ 10 % [36] like the comfort category II of SFS-EN 15,251 [47]. Therefore, DHashrae = 0 is associated with category II, while DHashrae ≤ 10 % presumably provides performance similar to category III. The chosen solution, day-by-day, can be implemented by an actuator system acting on the operation parameters of space conditioning units, e.g., mass flow rate of heat transfer fluids or fan power. Notably, the implementation of the Pareto approach is fundamental to investigate different optimal solutions produced by the same optimization process, depending on the users\u2019 preferences (i.e., after MCDM), ensuring high flexibility and offering comprehensive insights about thermal comfort. 3 Results The application of the model predictive control (MPC) framework is simulated for the case study \u2013 BNZEB \u2013 referring to the day July 21, 2021. The assumed electricity price \u2013 including all taxes \u2013 is 0.22 \u20ac/kWhel, which was roughly the average value for Italian households in 2020/2021 [48]. The monitored weather data are used to generate the weather data file, simulating weather forecasts. Addressing only one day can appear not comprehensive, but the aim of this study is proposing and testing the methodology for a typical day of the summer season to understand the potential benefits as concerns energy/cost savings and thermal comfort, providing insights on different comfort models. In real-time applications within a building automation system, the MPC framework needs to be applied day by day to achieve a day-ahead optimization of HVAC control. In this theoretical study, performing optimization for all days of the summer season is not feasible from a computational viewpoint and goes beyond the aims. However, future studies will address the application to different climates and weather scenarios to fully characterize the potentiality of this framework. The achieved optimal control strategies are compared with a reference case (ref.), characterized by a fixed cooling setpoint temperature (24 h) equal to 26 °C, assuming a passive approach as concerns occupants\u2019 behavior (see section 2.2). This reference case has been chosen for the following reasons: \u2022 it is typical of Italian residential buildings, especially in the age of COVID 19 pandemic, which forces people to spend most time in their homes requiring 24 h space conditioning of buildings; the rising of outdoor temperatures due to climate change (values around 40 °C have been reached in Benevento during the ongoing summer 2022) worsens the situation making crucial a careful and constant micro-climatic control to ensure occupants\u2019 comfort and health; 26 °C is the conventional cooling setpoint temperature according to the Italian standards [49]; \u2022 as shown in section 1, several previous studies [20,21,25,31] compared the proposed MPC frameworks with basic strategies at fixed setpoint in order to quantify the potential benefits compared to a typical, rudimental and not-efficient control; \u2022 the use of a passive approach \u2013 instead of an active one with variable setpoint \u2013 to model occupants\u2019 behavior enables to not overrate the potential benefits of MPC, as discussed in section 2.2. In addition, it is noticed that using a fixed setpoint strategy does not mean that the cooling system is switched on throughout the whole day, but only when the indoor temperature (Ti ) gets higher than the setpoint, i.e., 26 °C in this case. Accordingly, Fig. 4 shows the daily trend of hourly Ti values during the examined day applying the reference control, outlining the hours when the cooling system is switched on and off, respectively. Notably, the cooling system is turned off during most night hours because the outdoor temperature is quite low, falling below 20 °C, thereby making redundant the use of night-time set-back for the reference case. The validated EnergyPlus model provides the following ref. performance indicators: \u2022 CCref = 2.93c\u20ac/m2day; \u2022 PPDmaxref = 16.0 %; \u2022 PPDmeanref = 12.6 %; \u2022 DHashraeref = 25 %. It is noted that the comfort indices PPD and DH are standard outputs of EnergyPlus simulations. Hence, the MPC framework is applied for each couple of objective functions: \u2022 optimization 1 → CC vs PPDmax; \u2022 optimization 2 → CC vs PPDmean; \u2022 optimization 3 → CC vs DHashrae. In the days before the application day, the cooling system operates according to the reference strategy. 3.1 Convergence analysis A kind of convergence analysis is carried out to investigate the sensitivity of the achieved Pareto fronts to the number of generations, as shown in the Figs. 5\u20137 for optimizations 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The figures represent the Pareto fronts achieved after 25 generations (gen.), 50 gen. and at the end of the GA running. For optimization 3, convergence is reached before the maximum number of generations (i.e., 100). The results demonstrate that: \u2022 in all three cases the optimal solutions are consistent since the difference between consecutive Pareto fronts tends to decrease; indeed, the fronts related to 50 gen. and maximum gen. are almost overlapped; \u2022 accordingly, 50 gen. are sufficient to attain robust suboptimal solutions; \u2022 in order to reduce the computational time of the optimization process, 25 gen. are sufficient to achieve acceptable suboptimal solutions, even if the results are clearly worse because the Pareto front is completely dominated by the fronts related to higher numbers of generations. In this regard, using 25 gen., the computational time is reduced from 73.6 h to 18.4 h. Therefore, it becomes smaller than the planning horizon (24 h), making the framework feasible for real applications. The Pareto fronts related to the maximum number of generations are used for multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) in order to show the full potential of the proposed MPC framework. 3.2 Pareto optimization 1: CC vs PPDmax As concerns optimization 1, MCDM is carried out by constraining the value of PPDmax using two limits: a) PPDmax ≤ 10 %, associated with the comfort category II of SFS-EN 15251 [47]: \u201cNormal level of expectation and should be used for new buildings and renovations\u201d; b) PPDmax ≤ 15 %, associated with the comfort category III of SFS-EN 15251 [47]: \u201cAn acceptable, moderate level of expectation and may be used for existing buildings\u201d. With regard to scenario a) , Fig. 8 shows the achieved Pareto front highlighting the selected optimal solution and the reference case (ref.), while Fig. 9 represents the hourly values of cooling setpoint temperature (Tsp) over the planning horizon provided by such an optimal solution. This latter is characterized by the following performance indicators, which are all better (i.e., lower) than the reference ones: \u2022 CC = 2.71c\u20ac/m2day: \u2022 PPDmax = 9.7 %; \u2022 PPDmean = 7.6 %; \u2022 DHashrae = 0. With regard to scenario b) , the Pareto front and the optimal Tsp values are represented in Figs. 10 and 11 , respectively. The selected optimal solution features the following performance indicators, which are all better (i.e., lower) than the reference ones also in this case: \u2022 CC = 2.17c\u20ac/m2day; \u2022 PPDmax = 14.5 %; \u2022 PPDmean = 10.1 %; \u2022 DHashrae = 16.7 %. As expected, the optimal solution b) provides a lower thermal comfort level compared to a) but reduced cooling cost, well representing the human dilemma between \u201cspending less\u201d and \u201cfeeling better\u201d. 3.3 Pareto optimization 2: CC vs PPDmean As concerns optimization 2, MCDM is carried out by constraining the value of PPDmean using two limits: c) PPDmean ≤ 10 %, associated with a \u201crelaxed\u201d comfort category II of SFS-EN 15,251 [47], because the mean daily value of PPD is considered, and therefore the hourly PPD value can violate such a limit; d) PPDmean ≤ 15 %, associated with a \u201crelaxed\u201d comfort category III of SFS-EN 15,251 [47]. Again, with regard to scenario c) , the Pareto front and the optimal Tsp values are represented in Figs. 12 and 13 , respectively. The selected optimal solution features the following performance indicators, showing lower cooling cost than ref., with a similar comfort level: \u2022 CC = 2.11c\u20ac/m2day; \u2022 PPDmax = 17.7 %; \u2022 PPDmean = 10.0 %; \u2022 DHashrae = 25 %. With regard to scenario d) , the Pareto front and the optimal Tsp values are represented in Figs. 14 and 15 , respectively. The selected optimal solution features the following performance indicators, showing significantly lower cooling cost than ref., with a worse comfort level: \u2022 CC = 1.64c\u20ac/m2day; \u2022 PPDmax = 42.9 %; \u2022 PPDmean = 14.9 %; \u2022 DHashrae = 37.5 %. As expected, optimization 2, provides lower cooling cost but worse thermal comfort compared to optimization 1, because the comfort category is \u201crelaxed\u201d and high hourly values of PPD can occur. Therefore, this scenario fits cases with less rigorous comfort requirements and higher flexibility of occupants\u2019 behavior and expectations. 3.4 Pareto optimization 3: CC vs DHashrae As concerns optimization 3, the ASHRAE 55 adaptive comfort model with 90 % acceptability status [36] is considered. Such a model assesses the acceptability of indoor conditions as a function of monthly mean outdoor temperature and indoor operative temperature. It is here used to compare Fanger comfort theory with the adaptive one. Accordingly, a 90 % acceptability status is considered because it generally corresponds to PPD ≤ 10 % [36] like the comfort category II of SFS-EN 15251 [47]. Notably, the objective function is the percentage of hours not falling in the 90 % acceptability status, denoted with DHashrae (discomfort hours). MCDM is carried out by constraining the value of DHashrae using two limits: e) DHashrae = 0 corresponding, as aforementioned, to comfort category II of SFS-EN 15251; f) DHashrae ≤ 10 %, which presumably provides performance similar to comfort category III of SFS-EN 1525I. Again, with regard to scenario e) , the Pareto front and the optimal Tsp values are represented in Figs. 16 and 17 , respectively. The selected optimal solution features the following performance indicators, showing lower cooling cost than ref., with a similar comfort level according to the Fanger theory, but a higher level according to the adaptive one: \u2022 CC = 2.10c\u20ac/m2day; \u2022 PPDmax = 17.0 %; \u2022 PPDmean = 11.1 %; \u2022 DHashrae = 0. With regard to scenario f) , the Pareto front and the optimal Tsp values are represented in Figs. 18 and 19 , respectively. The selected optimal solution features the following performance indicators, showing lower cooling cost than ref., with a worse comfort level according to the Fanger theory, but a higher level according to the adaptive one: \u2022 CC = 1.98c\u20ac/m2day; \u2022 PPDmax = 52.6 %; \u2022 PPDmean = 13.6 %; \u2022 DHashrae = 8.3 %. 4 Discussion The achieved results are summarized in Table 5 as concerns performance indicators and Tsp values provided by the optimal solutions in all scenarios investigated, denoted with the letters a) - f) . The reference case (ref.) is reported too for comparison Table 5 . In all cases, the optimal solutions determine a reduction of the cooling cost compared to ref. case. Scenarios a) and b) \u2013 optimization 1 \u2013 provide the lowest reductions but the highest comfort levels, because they set stricter thermal comfort requirements, especially as concerns scenario a) (comfort category II). The adaptive comfort theory \u2013 optimization 3, scenarios e) and f) \u2013 provide similar results to the Fanger theory with \u201crelaxed\u201d comfort categories \u2013 optimization 2, scenarios c) and d) \u2013 showing that the \u201crelaxation\u201d of the categories emulates an adaptive occupants\u2019 behavior. In this regard, scenarios c) and e) \u2013 which refer to category II \u2013 determine thermal comfort levels similar to ref. with a cooling cost reduction of around 28 %. Furthermore, the optimal control strategies are consistent with the following observations: \u2022 during nights and early mornings (0:00\u20139:00) the cooling system is switched off because the outdoor temperature (Tout) is lower, except for scenarios a) - c) that feature stricter comfort requirements. Notably, scenarios b) and c) envisage the system switched on from 0:00 to 1:00 with a very low Tsp in order to drastically cool the indoor environment, thereby avoiding that in the next hours the indoor temperature increases excessively. Scenario a) envisages the system switched on from 0:00 to 3:00 to ensure higher thermal comfort (comfort category II). From 0:00 to 1:00 Tsp is lower for the same reason aforementioned and because Tout is higher. Notably, in such cases, the cooling system is switched on even if Tout is lower than Tsp in order to balance the load due to the heat stored in the building thermal mass during the previous day; \u2022 Tsp tends to be lower when the cooling system is switched on after the night break \u2013 i.e., from 9:00 to 10:00 \u2013 in order to drastically cool the indoor environment, thereby \u201cpreparing\u201d the building to the high heat loads of the next hours, when Tout rises, reducing the peak load of the system and increasing the efficiency. Accordingly, the control is optimized thanks to load predictions over the planning horizon. This is the essence of model predictive control. In summary, the proposed MPC framework can ensure energy/cost savings by maintaining or improving the thermal comfort level of the reference case. The user keeps his role of main actor because he/she can set the comfort requirements to be fulfilled. However, for real applications, the framework should be enhanced according to the following points: \u2022 the computational time required by the optimization process should be reduced, e.g., by using machine/deep learning methods as simulation tool; \u2022 the procedure should be integrated in a building automation system for achieving a real-time optimized control of space cooling systems. Thus, hardware and software equipment should be carefully designed, and a mobile app can be developed to ensure the best interaction with the users. In this regard, the forecasts of occupancy profiles can be integrated to attain customized and more efficient control strategies, and the setpoint temperatures can be optimized for each thermal zone based on such profiles. A vision of the potential application and upgrading of the proposed MPC framework is sketched in Fig. 20 . The framework can provide sentient space conditioning systems able to feel and satisfy the occupants\u2019 needs under the banner of sustainability. Substantial benefits can stem, concerning both private and public perspectives. Savings in costs and comfort improvement can be ensured for the single individuals, decrease in energy and carbon footprint of buildings can be ensured to the collectivity. Accordingly, since building space conditioning is liable for over 10 % of final energy uses and CO2-eq emissions at European and World levels [2,4], large-scale implementation of the framework, and generally of optimization-based model predictive controllers, can have a huge impact on energy transition toward sustainability and carbon neutrality. This is why research is pivotal to bring MPC into our homes. Definitely, the applicability of such controllers is not easy because there are some barriers/weak points than need to be overcome, but research is struggling to promote a widespread implementation of MPC to new and existing buildings. To achieve this goal, controllers need to be efficient, easy to install to different terminals (e.g., radiators, fan coils, heat pumps), smart, flexible for different users and destinations, feasible for large-scale deployment. As concerns the proposed framework, the main technical issues can concern the building energy simulation/prediction tool, which must be at the same time reliable and fast in predictions, i.e., requiring low computational burden. Machine/deep learning methods can be a solution in this regard providing MPC solutions based on artificial intelligence. Also, the controllers should be enhanced to be more flexible in order to take into account unexpected changes in weather forecasts and/or building use, using dynamic planning and application horizons. Furthermore, for a real implementation, different hardware (e.g., sensors, actuators) and software (e.g., monitoring tool, weather/occupancy forecasting tool, simulation tool, optimization tool) need to be integrated in a holistic framework to attain effective, digital and smart controllers able to feel and satisfy the occupants\u2019 needs under the banner of sustainability. Accordingly, model predictive controllers can couple the big revolutions of our times, i.e., energy and digital transitions. This is challenging also because often the main barrier is the people mindset, which is hard to change. However, model predictive controllers can make it possible because the potential energy, economic and comfort benefits are huge, with potentially low investments (payback times). Future studies will try to address such weak points to achieve a real implementation of the proposed conceptual MPC framework. 5 Conclusions This study simulates the application of an optimization-based framework for the model predictive control (MPC) of space cooling systems to a real nearly zero energy building located in Benevento \u2013 Southern Italy, Mediterranean climate. The framework provides optimal values of setpoint temperatures on a day-ahead planning horizon to minimize energy cost and thermal discomfort, based on weather forecasts. Accordingly, a Pareto optimization is implemented by coupling a genetic algorithm \u2013 working in MATLAB® environment \u2013 and a validated EnergyPlus model. Different objective functions related to thermal comfort are investigated to compare the Fanger theory with the adaptive one of ASHRAE 55. Thus, different two-objective optimizations (energy cost vs comfort) are implemented, and optimal solutions are selected to fit different comfort categories, i.e., II and III of SFS-EN 15251. The proposed case study refers to a specific day of the summer season, i.e., 21st July 2021. The monitored weather data are used to simulate weather forecasts. The optimal MPC solutions are compared with a reference control at the fixed setpoint of 26 °C. In this regard, the main conclusions can be drawn as follows: \u2022 the parameters of the optimization algorithm should be carefully set in order to reduce the computational time, which is essential in MPC applications. Accordingly, the results show that using 25 generations of the genetic algorithm \u2013 instead of 100 \u2013 can be sufficient to achieve acceptable suboptimal solutions, even if the outcomes are clearly worse; 50 generations provide the best compromise; \u2022 the optimal control strategies are able to predict the cooling load, thereby optimizing the hourly values of setpoint temperatures as a function of weather forecasts; \u2022 the optimal solutions always imply a reduction of the cooling cost compared to the reference case; \u2022 the Fanger comfort theory with \u201crelaxed\u201d comfort categories \u2013 i.e., considering the mean daily value of PPD (predicted percentage of dissatisfied) \u2013 provide results similar to the adaptive comfort one. In this regard, by referring to the solutions achieved for the comfort category II, the cooling cost is reduced by around 28 % compared to the reference case maintaining a similar comfort level; \u2022 the optimal solution achieved for the comfort category II using the Fanger theory determines a drastic improvement of thermal comfort compared to the reference case, reducing, at the same time, the cooling cost by around 8 %. Finally, the framework can ensure high energy and cost savings by maintaining or improving the thermal comfort level. Nevertheless, upgrades are required for the application in building automation systems. In this vein, future studies will address the following tasks: - use of machine/deep learning methods as a simulation tool in order to reduce the computational time of the optimization process, which is still excessive; - careful design of software and hardware equipment for a real implementation of the MPC framework. Research is needed to open our doors to large-scale deployment of model predictive controllers, which can play a crucial role in the energy and digital transition of the building sector.

        "dc:description": "The space conditioning of buildings is liable for more than 10 % of World final energy uses and related CO2-eq emissions. Such share must be drastically reduced to pursue sustainability by optimizing both energy design and devices control. In this frame, space cooling is assuming an increasing weight owing to climate change. Accordingly, this study applies a simulation- and optimization-based framework for the model predictive control (MPC) of space cooling systems. The case study is a nearly zero energy building located in Benevento \u2013 Southern Italy, Mediterranean climate \u2013 featuring an efficient air-source multi-split system for cooling. The framework is envisioned to provide optimal values of setpoint temperatures on a day-ahead planning horizon to minimize energy cost and thermal discomfort, based on weather forecasts. Accordingly, a Pareto multi-objective approach is applied considering different discomfort indicators to compare the Fanger theory with the adaptive one of ASHRAE 55. The optimization problem is solved by running a genetic algorithm \u2013 variant of NSGA II \u2013 under MATLAB® environment. The objective functions are assessed via the coupling between MATLAB® and EnergyPlus, using a validated building energy model. The multi-criteria decision-making is performed by setting a limit to discomfort to pick an optimal Pareto solution. The framework is tested addressing a typical day of the cooling season and using monitored weather data to simulate weather forecasts. Different optimal solutions are provided to fit different comfort categories. Compared to a reference control at fixed setpoint \u2013 26 °C \u2013 the proposed solutions with similar comfort performance ensure cost savings around 28 %. Besides the proposed hypothetical implementation, the framework can be integrated in automation systems for real-time MPC. The novel contributions of this study lie in the methodology to combine MPC with different thermal comfort models as well as in the results, which provide deeps insights about the application of MPC for the space cooling of nearly zero energy buildings in a balanced climate.",
