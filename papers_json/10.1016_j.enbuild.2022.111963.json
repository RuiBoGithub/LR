The application of hierarchical control to complicated systems can considerably simplify the complexity of system control. The multi-energy system can be divided into superior control (such as load forecasting), intermediate control (dispatch control of each subsystem), and subordinate control (equipment operation control under each subsystem), and a realisation path for the theory of overall control strategy based on hierarchical control is formulated. In this work, the combined cooling, heating, and power system(CCHP) + ground-source heat pump(GSHP) + conventional cold and heat source + storage systems are used as examples based on the TRNSYS platform. The objective is to achieve the best comprehensive evaluation index by simulating the system\u2019s key parameters of control. The operation control strategy method applicable to the typical multi-energy system is identified. When the system load rate exceeds 5%, the CCHP is switched on as a priority. Energy storage equipment release energy when the system load rate exceeds 13% with priority release at spike and peak sections. GSHP are turned on when the system load rate exceeds 37%. The gas boiler unit is turned on when the system load rate exceeds 72%. The system water supply temperature is simultaneously optimised in stages according to the outdoor air temperature. This strategy can make the annual comprehensive energy consumption per unit area of the case system the lowest. It can achieve better energy-saving operation effect in multi-energy system. Keywords Multi-energy system Layered control Start\u2013stop priority Overall scheduling 1 Introduction Designing the entire control system to perfectly manage and regulate complex systems is extremely difficult. However, dividing the hierarchical structure of complex systems into different levels and then controlling each level can considerably simplify control and management [1]. In the event of local failure in the control system, layered control can effectively isolate the fault. This can limit the fault impact locally to ensure the reliability of the entire system [2,3]. Moreover, the hierarchical control structure is flexible to adapt to system development. For large-scale systems that frequently change and expand the control object, managing change and expansion is easier if the local system is viewed as a collection of subsystems [4,5]. However, the application of hierarchical control also has its deficiencies. For example, subsystems may be mutually exclusive or contradictory to achieve their control objectives; in this case, the subsystems and their functions must be integrated and coordinated [6]. In implementing hierarchical control, limiting the scale of each level or subsystem and regulating the control objectives and relationships between levels and subsystems are necessary to fully benefit from the advantages of this control approach. At present, the layered control method is widely used in large-scale and complex structures of the regional dispersion of power system control [7]. Multi-energy system use subsystems for coupling energy production, transmission, consumption, and other links to achieve more efficient and perfect operation results. Furthermore, their system operation control is more complicated than traditional single-energy systems, complex structures, regional dispersion, etc. [8\u201310]. However, the size and capacity of the current mainstream multi-energy system are relatively small, the proportion of intermittent energy is high, and the application range of the layered control concept is low [11,12]. The optimisation of the operation control mode is achieved according to the system optimisation objectives, including system economy, environmental protection, and comprehensive benefits. The power supply equipment for implementing reasonable scheduling is a centralised coordination control strategy [13]. It does not comprehensively consider upper load prediction, other controls, and underlying equipment operation control optimisation research. For example, Zhang [14] optimised the demand and supply sides of the integrated energy system. However, only the scheduling of cooling, heating, and gas supply for a single user was optimised; it did not involve multi-user joint coordination optimisation and equipment start\u2013stop control and other aspects. Considering the demand side response, Yongli Wang [15] optimized the energy production and transmission process of the integrated energy system with the economic benefit and comprehensive capacity as the goal. However, the strategy does not involv the coordination and optimisation of the underlying equipment control and multiple. Yongli Wang [16] further optimised the energy scheduling between electric and thermal gas networks in integrated energy systems, but did not optimise the start\u2013stop and control of equipment operations within a single network. Kong [10] optimized the superior operation scheduling and intermediate equipment output of the network of composite energy system, but did not involve the optimization of the operating parameters of the subordinate equipment in a single network. Some control strategies consider layered control, but the research is often limited to the current layer control, not from the superior load prediction to the intermediate energy scheduling to the subordinate equipment start and stop overall optimization control. For example, Di Wu [17] divides the control of distributed energy system into coordination layer and equipment layer. The coordination layer is responsible for optimal scheduling, while the equipment layer controls equipment operation parameters. However, the influence of superior load prediction on system operation is not studied in this hierarchical idea. Mian Hu [18] proposes a hierarchical distributed algorithm for operators of total operating cost minimization, maximize the profitability of each aggregators, each user's maximum profit equilibrium strategy, the hierarchical control method considering the scheduling a few days ago, but no days rolling optimization, and not on the system operation strategy for research. To sum up, the current hierarchical control optimization of multi-energy systems is mostly limited to the optimization scheduling of intermediate equipment, without taking load prediction as the guidance of equipment scheduling, and lack of research on the operating parameters of the subordinate equipment. In view of the above shortcomings, based on the advantages of layered control, this study takes the typical CCHP + GSHP + conventional cold and heat source + storage systems as an example. Furthermore, the regulation of the multi-energy system at different levels (i.e. superior control, intermediate control, and subordinate control) is implemented. The hierarchical control structure of the multi-energy system is constructed using the TRNSYS simulation software. With the comprehensive evaluation index (i.e. equal to 0.43 × system costs + 0.39 × economic operation + 0.18 × environmental impact) as the optimisation target [19], the superior control (load forecast), intermediate control strategy (device start\u2013stop priority), and lower equipment control strategy are studied. Finally, an operation control strategy suitable for a typical multi-energy system is formulated, and the multi-level depth optimisation of the system and efficient coupling linkage control among different levels are realised. The hierarchical method takes into account the control of all levels from the subordinate equipment operation to the intermediate system scheduling to the superior load prediction, and can optimize the whole process of multi-energy system. 2 Research methods 2.1 Technical route This study defines the control of the multi-energy system at different levels as superior control, intermediate control, and subordinate control. The subordinate control , which is the equipment layer, mainly contains the control equipment at the end of the subsystem. It also implements local regulation, maintains the normal operation of the subsystem equipment. The itermediate control is mainly the central control equipment that schedules the operation strategy of each subsystem. It can effectively ensure flexible scheduling in the complex energy system. The superior control is the management platform of the composite energy system, which monitors the overall information, feeds forward, predicts the operation, controls and dispatches, and analyzes the centralized control strategy of the system. Furthermore, the load feed-forward prediction in the superior control of the multi-energy system is studied. The current feed-forward control theories and methods are summarised in this paper. A multi-energy system model and its control platform were built based on the TRNSYS simulation platform. According to the platform, the intermediate control strategy (i.e. the equipment start\u2013stop priority) of the multi-energy system is investigated. First, using actual research results, three more common operational control strategies (i.e. the priority scheme shown in Fig. 1 ) are examined. Then, the typical daily energy supply under each scheme are analysed and compared. The annual cumulative heat and cooling load supply as well as the energy consumption of the system are assessed. Finally, the optimal call priority order is determined. After determining the intermediate control strategy, the control strategy of the lower-level (i.e. underlying equipment) was studied. Then, the minimum load rate, thermostable heat, and thermostable time period of the three-way supply system were determined. The minimum load rate of the CCHP and GSHP were also obtained. The overall scheduling strategy combined with the middle priority control strategy of the multi-energy system was derived. The technology roadmap, shown in Fig. 1, is suitable for other typical multi-energy system control strategies and provides ideas for the control of multi-energy systems. 2.2 Hierarchical control model In this study, the multi-energy system is divided into three levels: superior control, intermediate control, and subordinate control (from the equipment structure), as shown in Fig. 2 . Moverover, the control parameters of each level are simulated and optimized to obtain the optimal control strategy in the current level The superior control mainly includes demand forecasting, operation parameter monitoring, and scheduling strategy formulation. Consequently, the multi-energy system can achieve environmental protection, economy, and efficiency under the premise of satisfying the balance between cold, heat, and electric power. The intermediate control is mainly used to schedule subsystem matching. After the superior control predicted cold, heat and electricity loads. In order to achieve the best comprehensive benefit, the intermediate control will determine the cooling quantity, heating quantity and power supply required by each subsystem in the forecast period according to the system characteristics under the condition of ensuring the balance of energy supply. To achieve direct local control, the subordinate control of the multi-energy system mainly hosts the subsystems, pump and other equipment, start\u2013stop, temperature, and flow controls. The subordinate control coordinates micro gas turbine, GSHP and other subsystems according to the output determined by the intermediate control, and controls the relevant operation parameters of each subsystem, so as to ensure the safe and efficient operation of the subsystem under the corresponding load conditions. 2.3 Simulated computing platform and optimisation objectives This study builds a simulation platform based on TRNSYS for multi-energy systems, as shown in Fig. 3 , to realise the hierarchical control of the case system. The computing platform consists of eight parts: 1) regional overall information input system; 2) main control system; 3) pipe network transmission and distribution system; 4) GSHP; 5) hot and cold gas CCHP; 6) auxiliary heat and cold source system; 7) storage system; and 8) calculation output system. Overall, the types of external input parameters of the energy system model include meteorological parameters, user hot and cold power load, equipment dynamic performance curve, and system equipment design selection parameters, which serve as the boundary conditions of system simulation calculation. After obtaining the user\u2019s hot and cold power demand, the system model distributes relevant load data to different subsystems, such as CCHP and GSHP, according to the control logic. The subsystems realise dynamic simulation calculations with the equipment performance parameters after receiving the control signal. Finally, they achieve the dynamic simulation of the system and output the relevant calculation results. Detailed equipment models are found in the literature [19]. Based on the platform shown above, this study uses the comprehensive evaluation index proposed by the author [19] to consider the influence of system cost, economic operation, and environmental impact. Each index is empowered based on the qualitative method of hierarchical analysis and the sensitivity quantitative analysis method based on the Monte Carlo simulation. The indicators and weights at all levels are summarised in Table 1 . The index is researched based on the above platform, and the index and weight obtained are suitable for comprehensive energy system planning. In the table, the calculation of indicators at all levels in a typical system (triple-supply and GSHP, storage, and gas boiler system) is divided by the calculation of indicators in conventional energy systems (e.g. gas boilers and chiller systems). The ratio is multiplied by the corresponding weight coefficients, and results are added. The comprehensive evaluation index, Y, of the case system in this study can be obtained as follows: Y = 0.43 × system cost ratio + 0.39 × economic operating ratio + 0.18 × environmental impact ratio. 2.4 Typical system equipment parameters This research project is located in Hebei Province. The complex includes offices and a hospital. The total construction area is approximately 476 000 m2, the total cooling load of the region is 41364.4 kW, and the total heating load is 24 609.2 kW. Research on the layered control technology of multi-energy systems has been conducted on the CCHP and GSHP as well as conventional cold and hot sources and storage systems. For the multi-energy system to satisfy the heating and cooling requirements of buildings, such as the energy supply target and CCHP power generation for the energy system, the capacity of each equipment is configured, as summarised in Table 2 . The main parameters of the equipment and economic calculation constraints of the project system are listed in Table 3 . The gas price is calculated at 3.76 yuan/m3 for non-residential classes. Regional electricity prices are divided into spikes, peaks, flat, and valley in terms of price and time, as follows. At a peak power demand (18:00\u201320:00), the electricity price is 1.0636 yuan per degree; at a flat power demand (7:00 and 11:00\u201317:00), electricity prices are 0.9352 and 0.6786 yuan per degree, respectively; and at a valley power demand (23:00\u20137:00), the electricity price is 0.6786\u20130.3578 yuan per degree. 3 Superior control policy of multi-energy system Superior control is the core of flexible scheduling and coupling matching of multi-energy systems. It includes demand forecasting, operation parameter monitoring, and formulation of scheduling strategy. Accordingly, the multi-energy system can achieve environmental protection, economy, efficiency under the premise of satisfying the balance between cold, heat, and electric power. The accuracy of the feed-forward prediction of system demand is a prerequisite for the formulation and optimisation of operational strategy. Therefore, based on the actual demand for the superior control of the multi-energy system, this study investigates the feed-forward prediction method. 3.1 System feed-forward control theory Feed-forward control is a class of computer algorithms that use process models to control the future behavior of objects. Although there are various forms of feed-forward control, feed-forward control generally includes three major parts: prediction model, rolling optimization and feedback correction. The function of prediction model is to predict the future output of an object according to its historical information and future input. Online rolling optimization is the most important feature of predictive control. Rolling optimization is a process of finite time optimization based on actual feedback information, which can constantly consider the impact of uncertainty and timely correction. Feedback correction is the basis of rolling optimization, after the optimization of predictive control determined the role of a series of future control, in order to prevent the deviation of control from ideal state caused by model mismatch or environmental interference, predictive control first realizes the control function at this moment, and at the next moment, it first detects the actual output of the object, and uses this real-time information to modify the model-based prediction, and then carries out new optimization. The predictive control process is shown in Fig. 4 below. The set input (y set) and the actual output (y) of the feedback are taken as the input, and the output reference trajectory (y r) is obtained according to the existing reference trajectory. The reference trajectory (y r) and the predicted output (y c) are used as the input for rolling optimization, and the independent variables (u) of optimal optimization objective are obtained. The controlled object performs the current control according to the control variable (u) to obtain the actual output value (y). The predictive model gets the model output (ym ) according to the control variable (u). The model output (ym ) and the actual output (y) are processed to obtain the prediction output (yc ), which is again used as the input of rolling optimization for the next rolling optimization. The actual output (y) is also fed back to the reference trajectory for the next prediction. At present, the practical forecast control methods are dynamic matrix control, model algorithm control, generalised prediction control, model prediction heuristic control, and prediction function control [20,21]. These methods have the following characteristics. (1) The techniques can be implemented online by computer. (2) Modelling is convenient and does not require knowledge of the internal mechanism of the process because model accuracy is not high. (3) A rolling optimisation strategy and repeated optimisation calculations can be implemented such that compensations for model mismatch and changes in the external environment caused by uncertainty can be timely implemented to improve the control quality [22]. 3.2 Outdoor weather parameters and load prediction The prediction of hot and cooling loads in buildings is a specific application of feed-forward control technology in HVAC systems. The accurate prediction of building load is a prerequisite for the energy-saving control of multi-energy systems. The traditional HVAC system control strategy is an on-demand energy supply. It is mainly based on a steady-state calculation method, that is, the load is assumed to be positively correlated with the indoor and outdoor temperature difference. It ignores the outdoor wind speed, radiation, indoor environmental parameters, and other factors. As a result, climate compensation technology and prediction models combined with feed-forward technology have been widely used in HVAC systems. Presently, there are two main methods for building load prediction. The first is the traditional mathematical prediction method, such as the parameter regression method. The second type is based on machine learning prediction method, such as time series method, artificial neural network, and support vector machine [23,24]. Defects in the use of the above mathematical models to predict the air conditioning load are encountered. Moreover, detailed models require memory increase, mathematical equations do not easily adapt to physical conditions or health changes, computer processing time is extremely long, satisfactory accuracy is not achieved, and building description input is overly high. To achieve more accurate predictions, traditional statistical methods provide new forecasting methods, such as artificial neural networks. In 1995, Kawashima et al. [25] quantitatively compared and demonstrated seven load prediction models, including artificial neural network models, using identical data. The results showed that because the time series model was completely dependent on a previous series of data, considerable limitations in its use to track load fluctuations caused by the weather were encountered. Moreover, dealing with nonlinear problems using a linear regression model was difficult. In particular, the potential advantage of the artificial neural network model was in the nonlinear recognition of HVAC systems in which its predictions were the most accurate. Artificial neural networks have many applications in HVAC systems, such as nonlinear calculation, air conditioning load prediction, intelligent control, and fault diagnosis. These networks have achieved satisfactory prediction accuracy according to their application scenarios. Because artificial neural networks are extremely portable, they can be applied to different buildings with only slight modifications. Moreover, artificial neural networks are simple and easy to operate and capable of determining the complex relationship of a process without understanding its internal mechanism. In addition, the parallel processing of neurons substantially improves the calculation and running speed, thus facilitating real-time control. In view of these, this paper proposes the use of an artificial neural network as a superior control method to predict the cooling load of buildings. The neural network prediction load flow is shown in Fig. 5 . The prediction process involves entering the sample set of the neural network after data normalisation, further determination of the neural network structure, training the neural network algorithm, and deriving a neural network model after convergence. This model can be used to predict the load [26,27]. In this work, owing to the limitations of the actual project, real data are not available to study the relationship between load forecasting and the operation optimisation control of the multi-energy system; hence, subsequent improvements cannot be implemented. In addition, the study of load prediction in feed-forward control is mature; thus, no further research on load forecasting in superior control is conducted in this work. 4 Intermediate control strategy for multi-energy systems By considering the typical system presented above, the characteristics of each subsystem, and the actual research results, the following typical operational control strategies are proposed as bases for three schemes. Scenario 1: CCHP > energy storage equipment > GSHP > gas boiler (chiller). The priority is to open the CCHP to sustain the base load. During the day, the main building load is given priority to the energy storage equipment. When the CCHP and energy storage equipment supply capacity are insufficient, the GSHP and gas boiler (chiller) are opened for peak adjustment and supplement Scenario 2: CCHP > GSHP > energy storage equipment > gas boiler (chiller). The priority is to open the CCHP to sustain the base load and GSHP to bear the main building load . When the CCHP and GSHP power supply capacities are insufficient, the energy storage equipment and gas boiler (chiller) are opened for peak adjustment and supplement Scenario 3: GSHP > CCHP > energy storage equipment > gas boiler (chiller). First, the GSHP is turned on to sustain the base load. Moreover, the CCHP is the main source of supplementary energy. When the CCHP and GSHP power supply capacities are insufficient, the energy storage equipment and gas boiler (chiller) are opened for peaking and supplementation. Further, the advantages and disadvantages of a typical system control scheme are determined based on the TRNSYS dynamic simulation analysis via a comprehensive evaluation method. In this case, the typical day-by-day energy supply under different schemes, the annual cumulative heat and cooling load energy supply ratio, the year-round time-by-time energy supply status, and the system\u2019s annual energy consumption level are compared for analysis. 4.1 Run policy analysis on typical day-by-day basis under different scenarios Using the simulation platform presented above, with the comprehensive evaluation index as the optimisation target, the daily operation of the typical system under different schemes is analysed. When the typical day load rate is 100%, 75%, 50% and 25%, the operation situation of Scenario 1 is shown in Figs. 6\u20139 , respectively. When the typical day load rate is 100%, 75%, 50% and 25%, the operation situation of Scenario 2 is shown in Figs. 10\u201313 , respectively. When the typical day load rate is 100%, 75%, 50% and 25%, the operation situation of Scenario 3 is shown in Figs. 14-17 , respectively. From the above result: (1) Under the conditions of Scenarios 1 and 2, the CCHP is opened to sustain the base load first. The operation hours and economy of the CCHP are realised for most of the day under typical daily load rates of 100%, 75%, 50%, and 25%. Under the Scenarios 3, the CCHP opening at 50% and 25% of the typical day load rate cannot use more hours of the opening of the day, thereby reducing the annual operating hours of the CCHP. (2) Under the condition of Scenario 1, the storage device (as the second priority energy storage mode) can achieve a greater degree of energy storage and energy utilisation under typical daily load rates of 100%, 75%, 50%, and 25% to improve the energy utilisation rate of the system. Moreover, the operating costs of the system are reduced. The failure of Scenarios 2 and 3 to prioritise the use of storage system for energy supply and to fully use the storage system at typical load rates of 50% and 25% results in higher system operating costs. Overall, under the conditions of Scenario 1 and 2, the advantages of the CCHP can be leveraged to ensure the daily running time of the CCHP. The CCHP under the scheme can be operated at full load for most of the time owing to the basic load and high energy efficiency. This can ensure that the operating cost of the system is relatively low. In Scenario 3, although the overall energy consumption of the system is low, the advantages of the triple-supply and storage systems cannot be fully leveraged, resulting in wasted investment. 4.2 Proportion of energy supply of annually accumulated heating and cooling loads Figs. 18\u201322 show the heating and cooling load ratio of the system\u2019s main equipment and subsystem year-round time-by-time heating and cooling hours after a year-round dynamic simulation calculation. Figs. 18\u201319 show that under the conditions of Scenario 1, the CCHP assumes 18.30% of the yearly cumulative cold and hot load demand in the region. The system annually operates for a total of 3975 h, whereas the GSHP covers 63.75% (i.e. 4312 h) of the same annual total demand. Conventional energy systems account for 17.95% of the above yearly demand with 1034 h of operation. Under Scenario 2, the CCHP covers 18.30% of the total cold and heat load demand in the region throughout the year with a total of 3975 h of operation. The GSHP covers 67.49% of the same annual total demand with 4138 h of operation. The conventional energy system covers 14.21% of this annual requirement with an operating time of 785 h. Under Scenario 3, the CCHP covers 10.85% of the annual total cold and heat load demand in the region with a total of 2753 h of operation. The GSHP covers 78.51% of the same demand with 4593 h of operation. The conventional energy system covers 10.64% of the above requirement with 712 h of operation. From what has been discussed above, the CCHP under the conditions of Scenarios 1 and 2 can sustain a large proportion of the heating and cooling load demand throughout the year while ensuring that the operating hours of the system reach more than 3000 h to achieve better system economy and energy utilisation. Under the Scenario 3, the system has low operating hours throughout the year, and the proportion of cold and hot loads is low. Consequently, the advantages of high energy utilisation and those of the CCHP cannot be fully leveraged. Therefore, based on the typical day energy supply situation of each subsystem during the heating season in terms of the heating load, cooling load and power load demand of the building during different seasons, the operation mode of Scenario 1 is better. 4.3 Analysis of system\u2019s comprehensive operation effect The system\u2019s annual energy consumption level is shown in Fig. 20. Under Scenario 1, the annual energy consumption per unit area is 48.73 kWh/(m2∙a), and the annual energy consumption per unit area under Scenario 2 is 51.17 kWh/(m2∙a). The annual energy consumption per unit area under Scenario 3 is 55. kWh/(m2∙a). The foregoing shows that the conditions of operation scheduling under Scenario 1 result in the lowest energy consumption level for the system, fully ensuring that the system can run efficiently. The above clearly indicates that the typical system must be in accordance with the middle control strategy of Scenario I (CCHP > energy storage equipment > GSHP > gas boiler (chiller)) for scheduling control. 5 Sub-control strategy for multi-energy systems Based on the study of the intermediate control of the typical system, a best operation strategy is defined. Further, based on the TRNSYS simulation platform, the operating principles of the CCHP, the minimum load opening rate of the equipment, and the subordinate control strategy are ana·lysed. 5.1 Principle of CCHP operation This project uses the TRNSYS dynamic simulation optimisation platform with a comprehensive evaluation index as the optimisation target. It optimises the operation principle of the CCHP and determines the opening ratio of the period with principle of heat fixed electricity and principle of electricity fixed heat. Under the principle of heat fixed electricity, and according to the user\u2019s heating load demand, when the system heating load demand reaches 40% of the customised heating capacity of the CCHP and peak electricity price, the CCHP is switched on. Under the principle of electricity fixed heat, and according to the user\u2019s power load demand, when the system power load demand reaches 40% of the customised power capacity of the CCHP and peak electricity price, the CCHP is switched on. Based on the principle of minimum energy consumption for system operation, the independent variable will be determined by thermal setting or by electric setting thermal opening mode (0: principle of heat fixed electricity; 1: principle of electricity fixed heat). Thus, the simulation platform automatically summarises the simulation results of the relevant operating strategy and determines the opening principle of the CCHP, as shown in Fig. 21. The optimisation results in the above figure show that the coupling system runs at the principle of heat fixed electricity throughout the year for 1353 h. It mainly operates from January to March of the heating season; for the rest of the year, it runs on the principle of electricity fixed heat. This indicates that to ensure optimal coupling system performance, the operating strategy based on the thermostatic principle must employed from January to March of the heating season, and the operating strategy based on the thermostatic principle must be used for the rest of the year. The following discussion is based on the optimisation results of the CCHP operation mode, the simple use of the heat fixed electricity mode, and the simple use of the electricity fixed heat operation mode for comparison. Fig. 22 shows the considerable variations in the comprehensive energy utilisation rate and system operating load rate of the CCHP under different operating modes. The optimised operation mode derived by this study can ensure that the load rate of the CCHP is high and improve the comprehensive energy utilisation rate of the system. 5.2 Minimum load of device on rate control In the multi-energy system, the equipment characteristics of the CCHP and GSHP must be matched with the overall operating effect. Therefore, to further improve the operating economy of the system, the minimum load rate of the CCHP and GSHP equipment in typical systems are analysed. In this study, different parameters were taken as the minimum opening load rate of the CCHP and GSHP. Moreover, the change in the comprehensive evaluation index of the typical system was analysed. The calculated simulation results are summarised in Table 4 . According to the simulation results, the lower the opening load rate requirement of the CCHP, the longer its annual operating hours. However, because the system is in a lower load, the running time is longer, the GSHP running time is reduced, and the overall energy consumption increases. The lower the minimum load rate of the GSHP, the lower the overall energy consumption of the GSHP (because of its role as a supplementary energy supply and high efficiency). Combined with the results, the comprehensive evaluation index is the best when the CCHP is at 50% load rate and the GSHP is at 10% load rate as the lowest opening condition. 5.3 Lower-level control of overall scheduling policy The commonly used overall scheduling strategy for the system includes the system return temperature control mode, outdoor temperature control mode, and system load rate control mode. The strategy employs the traditional single-control parameters for system equipment operation control scheduling. Based on the hierarchical control method of the multi-energy system, the subordinate control of hierarchical control is proposed. (1) In the superior control stage, the system analyses and corrects the energy demand and energy supply strategy according to the outdoor meteorological parameters and load prediction results. (2) Based on the superior control, a system water supply temperature optimisation strategy based on outdoor temperature parameters was developed. (3) The system implements the subsystem priority order according to the intermediate control strategy. (4) At the same time, based on the optimisation of the water supply temperature, the number of units and the equipment start-stop are controlled according to the load rate state of the system, forming a combination control method based on the outdoor temperature and load rate. In this study, the hierarchical control strategy based on (2) and (4) and the general single-parameter control method are compared and analysed. General GSHPs, chillers, and other equipment are employed during summer cooling and winter heating. However, the energy efficiency of the system is directly affected by the water supply temperature. The water supply temperature increases and decreases by the end of summer and winter, respectively. In the latter, the operating power of the unit is reduced, thereby improving the energy efficiency of the unit. In the formulation of the actual control strategy, the unit\u2019s water supply temperature and the outdoor temperature regulation monitoring data are effectively considered to achieve the automatic optimisation of the water supply temperature, as shown in Figs. 23\u201324 . To optimise the water supply temperature of the system based on the outdoor temperature, the equipment start\u2013stop and number of units are controlled according to the load rate status of the system. When the system load rate exceeds 5%, the CCHP is switched on as a priority. The system operates in accordance with electric fixed heat or heat fixed electric. When it satisfies the minimum load opening rate of 50%, the CCHP is opened first. When it is not satisfied with the load rate opening conditions, the ground-source heat pump system is opened first. Energy storage equipment is turned on when the system load rate exceeds 13% with priority release at spike and peak sections. GSHP are turned on when the system load rate exceeds 37% (the control is based on the ratio difference between 37% and 72% of the total number of units). The gas boiler unit is turned on when the system load rate exceeds 72% (the control is based on the ratio difference between 72% and 100% of the total number of units). The system water supply temperature is simultaneously optimised in stages according to the outdoor air temperature. The following is a comparison between the operation effects of the subordinate control and traditional single parameter control. The results (Fig. 25 ) show that under the condition of the hierarchical control strategy proposed in this paper, the system unit area has the lowest comprehensive energy consumption. Thus, the control strategy can achieve energy-saving operation effects in a typical system. 6 Conclusion This study considered the CCHP, GSHP, and conventional hot and cold source and storage system project as an example. The classification control concept commonly used in power systems is introduced into the control of a multi-energy system. The intermediate control strategy of the multi-energy system, particularly the equipment start\u2013stop priority and the lower-level underlying equipment control strategy, is investigated. The specific conclusions derived are as follows: 1. Start and stop priority for CCHP + GSHP + conventional cold and heat source + energy storage system. The priority is to open the CCHP to sustain the base load. During the day, the main building load is given priority to the energy storage equipment. When the CCHP and energy storage equipment supply capacity are insufficient, the GSHP and gas boiler (chiller) are opened for peak adjustment and supplement. In this scheme, the annual energy consumption per unit area is 48.73kWh/(m2·a), which is the lowest compared with other schemes and can fully ensure the efficient operation of the system 2. Select the operation mode of the triple supply system. From January to March of the heating season, CCHP follows the principle of heat fixed electricity. For the remaining period, CCHP follows the principle of electricity fixed heat. This operation mode can guarantee the system to be in a high load rate and improve the comprehensive energy utilization rate of the system to a large extent. 3. Selection of minimum load rate for equipment. In the CCHP + GSHP + conventional cold and heat source + energy storage system , the minimum opening condition of CCHP is at a load rate of 50%. For the GSHP, the minimum opening condition is at a load rate of 10%. In this case, the operation hours of the CCHP are 3905 h, and the annual operation hours of the GSHP are 6228 h. 4. The overall scheduling strategy for the CCHP, GSHP, and conventional hot and cold source and storage systems based on layered control logic is as follows. When the system load rate exceeds 5%, the CCHP is switched on as a priority. The system operates in accordance with electric fixed heat or heat fixed electric. When it satisfies the minimum load opening rate of 50%, the CCHP is opened first. When it is not satisfied with the load rate opening conditions, the GSHP is opened first. Release energy is turned on when the system load rate exceeds 13% with priority release at spike and peak sections. GSHP units are turned on when the system load rate exceeds 37% (the control is based on the ratio difference between 37% and 72% of the total number of units). The gas boiler unit is turned on when the system load rate exceeds 72% (the control is based on the ratio difference between 72% and 100% of the total number of units). The system water supply temperature is simultaneously optimised in stages according to the outdoor air temperature. Compared with the traditional single control parameter, the annual comprehensive energy consumption per unit area of the system is the lowest, which is 48.73kWh/(m2·a) under the condition of this strategy. In this work, the concept of hierarchical control is introduced into the regulation of multi-energy systems. The control of multi-energy systems is optimised at different levels to scientifically and effectively take into account all factors. Moreover, the problem of system control optimisation is systematically solved, and relevant optimisation ideas are provided. For the control of other types of energy stations in actual engineering projects, the control system of the energy station is divided into three levels according to this method, and the control parameters of each level are simulated and optimized in order to find the optimal strategy of the existing strategy or reaserch the energy saving of the new operation strategy. However, this method is affected by the accuracy of superior control and load prediction, and the workload of hierarchical control is large, which requires control strategy planning step by step. Compared with the traditional single variable control method, this method means more work.

        "dc:description": "The application of hierarchical control to complicated systems can considerably simplify the complexity of system control. The multi-energy system can be divided into superior control (such as load forecasting), intermediate control (dispatch control of each subsystem), and subordinate control (equipment operation control under each subsystem), and a realisation path for the theory of overall control strategy based on hierarchical control is formulated. In this work, the combined cooling, heating, and power system(CCHP) + ground-source heat pump(GSHP) + conventional cold and heat source + storage systems are used as examples based on the TRNSYS platform. The objective is to achieve the best comprehensive evaluation index by simulating the system\u2019s key parameters of control. The operation control strategy method applicable to the typical multi-energy system is identified. When the system load rate exceeds 5%, the CCHP is switched on as a priority. Energy storage equipment release energy when the system load rate exceeds 13% with priority release at spike and peak sections. GSHP are turned on when the system load rate exceeds 37%. The gas boiler unit is turned on when the system load rate exceeds 72%. The system water supply temperature is simultaneously optimised in stages according to the outdoor air temperature. This strategy can make the annual comprehensive energy consumption per unit area of the case system the lowest. It can achieve better energy-saving operation effect in multi-energy system.",
