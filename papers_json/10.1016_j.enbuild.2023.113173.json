Defrost control using digital image processing is a potential, economical, and energy-saving solution for air-source heat pump or refrigeration system, comparing with currently studied or used direct/indirect measuring methods. However, under complex operating condition of different shooting angles, lighting conditions, and pixel level, which are common in refrigeration system, the accuracy of frost state recognition with existing digital image processing methods decrease dramatically. Therefore, a new method based on optimized gray level co-occurrence matrix and new characterization parameter combination to extract image texture characteristics, combining extreme learning machine algorithm (OGLCM-ELM), is proposed for the first time. An experimental rig for evaporator frosting image under different lighting intensity, shooting angle and pixel level is set up. The collected experimental image data are divided into 3 classifications (Frostless, light frost, and heavy frost) or 2 classifications ((Frostless + light frost, and heavy frost)). The results show for ternary classification, OGLCM-ELM reveals significantly higher recognition accuracy then existing methods, average accuracy is as higher as 98.14%. It is also 5.28% and 3.14% higher than those of OGLCM-SVM, OGLCM-BP. Other performance parameters, precision, recall, F1-score, and calculating time are also totally better than other methods. For binary classification. the average accuracy of OGLCM-ELM even reaches 99% under complex operating condition, indicating it is a practical and potential technology for defrost control.

However, when the surface temperature of the outdoor heat exchanger of ASHP is lower than both zero and the dew point temperature of the outdoor air, frosting on the surface of the heat exchanger fins and tubes will probably occur [6,7]. With the growth of the frost layer, airflow between the heat exchange fins is hindered, and the heat transfer resistance between air and refrigerant increases, which can cause significant degradation of heat exchange performance, further resulting in decreases in both efficiency (as high as 35\u201360% [8\u201311]) and heating capacity (as high as 30 ∼ 57% [12\u201314]) of the whole heat pump system. In severe cases, it may even cause accidents such as shutdown and compressor damage. To ensure the stable operation of refrigeration equipment and reduce energy consumption, defrosting the outdoor heat exchanger is necessary. At present, the main defrosting approaches include reverse cycle defrosting [15\u201318], hot gas bypass defrosting [19,20], electric heating defrosting [21,22], etc. The defrost effect depends not only on the defrost approach but also on the defrost control method. However, in practical engineering, the identification of frost is not accurate enough, leading to too frequent defrosting or belated defrosting. Therefore, defrost control method with high accuracy, low cost, and good adaptability are necessary to be studied [23]. Some of studied methods are based on direct parameters of frost (layer thickness, frost area, etc), namely, direct defrost-start control method. While the rest of them are so-called indirect method, based on parameters not directly measured from frost layer, such as pressure or temperature at certain point of ASHP. The most common indirect control methods is the time control, due to its low cost [24]. Using the time control method, the running time of the compressor is measured, and defrost starts when the running time of the compressor reaches a preset value. However, it may result in inaccurate defrost start times, as the set running time not always match the time of frost growth, which changes a lot with different working conditions. In an experimental of time control defrost method, Wang et al. [13] found that nearly 68% of the defrosting was unnecessary. They improved the time control method by measuring not only the compressor run time but also the evaporating temperature to determine defrost time, that is T-T defrost control method. Wang et al. [12] showed that T-T still lead to inaccurate defrost initiation times under variable operating conditions, namely, \u201cmal-defrosting\u201d. For example, T-T might perform a defrost operation without a frost layer in low humidity conditions. Liu et al. [9] proved that the \u201cmal-defrosting\u201d operation is as high as 53% in the experimental study using the T-T control method in 9 typical cities in China. To overcome the \u201cmal-defrosting\u201d, Chung et al. [25] experimentally studied a defrosting control method based on the pressure difference between the airs entering and leaving evaporator. It was significantly affected by installation position of the differential pressure sensor, which can cause 15.10 ∼ 19.50% identification error. The low accuracy of sensor also limited the performance of this method. Jiang et al. [26] proposed a defrosting control method based on refrigerant superheat. Experimental results showed that this method can realize the start of defrosting before the operation performance of the heat pump unit deteriorates rapidly. But frost is not the only factor for the change of superheat, leading to considerable inaccuracy. Generally, some progresses are found in the above defrost control methods, but substantial improvements are urgently needed to increase identification precision and avoid \u201cmal-defrosting\u201d. Efforts were also made to use direct measuring method to improve defrosting accuracy. Kandula [27] used vernier calipers to measure frost thickness. Experiments were carried out on the aluminum hydrophilic surface of a square plate with graduated calipers of 0.127 mm accuracy. The average of the measured values of 5 points was calculated as the frost thickness. However, the device and measurement might affect the growth of frost. Meanwhile, the average thickness still struggled to reflect the whole frost layer and it is also difficult to install electrodes, hampering wide practical application. Qu et al. [28] used interferometry to analyze local changes in frost thickness and morphology. The laser displacement meter was located below an experimental setup, facing the frost layer. Results showed that the measurement uncertainty of frost thickness is 0.01 mm. Dong et al. [29] used laser diffraction to measure the thickness of the frost on the evaporator surface. Diffraction fringes that based on the space between fin and reference surface moved, when the space was narrowed by the frost on the fin. With the displacement of diffraction fringes, the frost thickness measured with a high accuracy of 0.1 μm. Moreover, this method was non-contact, precise, real-time, and convenience. But errors caused by the heat carried by laser and the strong penetration of laser, limited its application, as well as the high initial cost. Matsumoto et al. [30] reported scanning probe microscope (SPM) measurement for frost thickness. In SPM, various interactions between the test board surface and the probe were attached to the cantilever end and were measured as the probe scanned the test board surface. The thickness value of this method was closer to the average thickness of the entire frost layer. However, the measurement process was too slow, the equipment was too expensive, and the scan probe might destroy frost crystal. Byun et al. [31] used photoelectric sensors for defrosting control, finding the accuracy of photoelectric conversion method was 5.5% higher than that of time defrosting control method. Low classification accuracy for uneven frost and complicated installation were main disadvantages. Ge et al. [32] proposed a defrosting control method using tube-encircled photoelectric sensors (TEPS) and experimentally confirmed a 4.1%∼10.9% improvement in average COP. However, it may perform \u201cmal-defrosting\u201d operation as it can only test the frost at single location. Besides, expensive cost and short life further weakened its suitability for commercial use. Therefore, low-cost, easy-to-operate direct measurement methods are still needed to deal with current dilemma. Image processing technology can directly analysis frost area, is playing an increasingly important role in defrost control as a direct measuring method, especially with the development of artificial intelligence technology [33]. Song et al. [34] studied the feasibility of digital image processing technology in frost thickness measurement. However, as the uneven characteristics of frost is not properly addressed, the precision is still low. Zheng et al. [35] proposed a multi-threshold segmentation method to further improve defrosting accuracy, incorporating additional system operating parameters including ambient temperature and relative humidity. Miao et al. [36] proposed a new defrosting control strategy using image processing technology and fractal theory. Compared with the traditional T-T method, the proposed control strategy reduced the defrosting energy consumption for \u201cdelayed defrost\u201d and \u201cunnecessary defrost\u201d by 10.6% and 22.3%, respectively. Li et al. [37] proposed a frost detection method based on image recognition and developed a new characteristic parameter to quantify the degree of frost formation. A series of experiments indicated that with the changes in shooting angles and lighting conditions (complex working condition), the characteristic parameter values decreased by respectively about 50% and 100%, which can adversely affect the accuracy of identification. Sun et al. [38] proposed a frost detection method based on the theory of gray contrast amplitude and average gray value of frost gray. The frost image was quantified and the proposed new characteristic parameter was use to evaluate the amount of frost on the evaporator coil. This method had a certain improvement in accuracy, but the error was still as high as 11.37%, when the lighting conditions were changed. Chen et al. [39] proposed a convolutional neural network model to extract deep and complex features for frosting state detection. Compared with the original time-based control method, the defrosting frequency and energy consumption were reduced by 31.68%, and 42.92%, respectively. However, for frosted images of different shooting angles and light intensities, the accuracy rate is only 75%, and the accuracy rate drops by 21%. From the above references, two conclusions can be drawn: \u2022 Firstly, that the accuracies of current defrost control methods are mainly in the range of 32%∼50% [9,13,24], being not fully prepared for practical application. \u2022 Secondly, current defrost control methods based on image processing technology show higher accuracies most in the range of 58%∼75% [36,38,39] in laboratory test, while strongly limited by the low ability of dealing with complex working condition (different shooting angles, lighting conditions, etc). Therefore, in this paper, a new defrost control method is presented, which proposes optimized gray level co-occurrence matrix (OGLCM) and new characterization parameter combination to extract texture characteristics and uses extreme machine learning (ELM) to classify. The OGLCM combining ELM method (OGLCM-ELM) is expected to significantly improve the recognition accuracy and the ability of dealing with complex operating condition, as it can crawl the unique information of surface texture characteristics of evaporator image, such as the direction, adjacent interval, and variation range of the image gray level. Besides, it can work with cheap and easy-to-operate devices. An ASHP frosting experimental system is then established to obtain experimental data samples of the outdoor heat exchanger under different environmental conditions. On this basis, the advantages of the new method are verified, and compared, and studied. The research results are expected to be applied to the identification of the frosting state of the outdoor heat exchanger to effectively increase the defrosting control accuracy, thereby improving the stability, safety, and energy efficiency of the heat pump system. 2 Method The method includes four main parts: image preprocessing, calculation of modified gray level co-occurrence matrix, extraction of surface texture feature as statistic parameters, training the OGLCM-ELM model. 2.1 Image pre-processing Before feature extraction, image preprocessing needs to be performed to obtain the depth surface texture feature vector of each image. 2.1.1 Image denoising The image may be polluted by random noise in the process of acquisition or transmission, interfering with subsequent image segmentation, feature extraction, and other processing. Thus, the image usually needs to be denoised [40]. The main noise of frost image, caused by insufficient lighting or sudden temperature change is Gaussian noise, which greatly impacts the overall image. Therefore, this study uses Gaussian filtering algorithm to process the images. In the algorithm, the gray value of all pixels in the neighborhood of the pixel to be processed is weighted using Gaussian template firstly. Then, the gray value of the processed pixel is replaced by the weighted result, expressed as follows: (1) G x , y = 1 2 π σ 2 e - x 2 + y 2 2 σ 2 2.1.2 Image grayscale compression Generally speaking, the gray level of a grayscale image is 0\u2013255, a total of 256 levels, and the extraction of texture features in this range involves an extremely huge amount of computation [41]. When using the gray level co-occurrence matrix to calculate the image texture features, considering the calculation efficiency, it is necessary to compress the gray level of the image. This research will use distortionless compression. Firstly, the color components of the sample image are converted into corresponding grayscale images, and their expression forms such as Eq. (2), and then the grayscale levels of the grayscale images are compressed. Under the premise of ensuring the accuracy of the model, the gray value of the image is properly compressed to the gray level (g), which is beneficial to improve the training speed of the model. In this study, the image gray level corresponding to the compression level 1\u20135 is 8, 16, 32, 64, 128 and 256, respectively. (2) Gray = 0.3 R + 0.59 G + 0.11 B The complete image pre-processing process is shown in Fig. 1 . 2.2 Optimized gray-level co-occurrence matrix (OGLCM) 2.2.1 Principle of the gray level co-occurrence matrix The statistical method of gray level co-occurrence matrix was proposed by Haralick et al. [42] in the early 1970s. It is a comprehensive texture analysis method proposed on the premise that the spatial distribution relationship between each pixel in the image contains the image texture information. The gray-level co-occurrence matrix is defined as the joint probability formed by the simultaneous occurrence of gray value j at the point leaving a fixed position (distance d , orientation θ) from the pixel with gray value i , and all the estimated values can be expressed in the form of a matrix, called the gray-level co-occurrence matrix(GLCM) [43,44]. As shown in Fig. 2 , shows how to solve the GLCM. At the same time, the joint probability density formula is P i , j , d , θ , and the GLCM in the four angular directions of 0°, 45°, 90°, and 135° are calculated by rotating counterclockwise around the vertical axis. Then the probability density formula of each direction is expressed as follows: (3) P 0 ° = f x 1 , y 1 = i , f x 2 , y 2 = j ; x 1 - x 2 = d & y 1 - y 2 = 0 (4) P 45 ° = f x 1 , y 1 = i , f x 2 , y 2 = j , x 1 - x 2 = y 1 - y 2 = d | | x 1 - x 2 = y 1 - y 2 = - d (5) P 90 ° = f x 1 , y 1 = i , f x 2 , y 2 = j ; x 1 - x 2 = 0 & y 1 - y 2 = d (6) P 135 ° = f x 1 , y 1 = i , f x 2 , y 2 = j ; x 1 - x 2 = d , y 1 - y 2 = - d | | x 1 - x 2 = - d , y 1 - y 2 = d The GLCM of an image can reflect comprehensive information such as the direction, adjacent interval, and variation range of the image gray level, so the GLCM has a good effect on feature extraction. 2.2.2 Optimized GLCM (OGLCM) and new characterization parameter combination for gray texture features According to the principle of gray co-occurrence matrix, its value is related to the construction parameters such as image gray level g, generation step d and scanning angle θ . In this paper, OGLCM is obtained by optimizing these construction parameters. Due to the large dimension of the GLCM, it is usually not directly used as a feature to distinguish textures. But based on it, statistic characterization parameter combination of contrast, homogeneity, correlation, and angular second moment are proposed as texture classification features. The four nonlinear statistic parameters are defined as follows: Contrast: It measures how the values of the matrix are distributed and how much the total local variation of the image is, reflecting the image's sharpness and the texture's groove depth. (7) Con = ∑ i ∑ j i - j 2 P θ , d i , j Homogeneity: It also known as the inverse moment, reflects the homogeneity of the image texture and measures the local variation of the image texture. (8) H = ∑ i ∑ j P θ , d i , j 1 + i - j 2 Correlation: It is used to measure the similarity of the gray levels of the image in the row or column direction, so the value of the value reflects the correlation of the local gray level. (9) Corr = ∑ i ∑ j i , j P θ , d i , j - μ i μ j σ i σ j Among them, μ i , μ j , σ i and σ j are defined as: (10) μ i = ∑ i = 0 ∑ j = 0 i ∙ P θ , d i , j (11) μ j = ∑ i = 0 ∑ j = 0 j ∙ P θ , d i , j (12) σ i = ∑ i = 0 ∑ j = 0 P θ , d i , j i - μ i 2 (13) σ j = ∑ i = 0 ∑ j = 0 P θ , d i , j j - μ j 2 Angular second moment: It is the sum of squares of the element values of the gray co-occurrence matrix, so it is also called energy. The energy transformation reflects the uniformity of the image distribution and the thickness of the texture. (14) ASM = ∑ i ∑ j P θ , d i , j 2 Through the above calculation method, the correlation statistic parameters in the four directions are solved respectively. However, the obtained 4 × 4 matrix requires a large amount of computation and the saved image information will be too redundant. In this paper, the grayscale texture features of the image are obtained by using the mean and standard deviation of four nonlinear correlation statistic parameters in four directions. 2.3 ELm Extreme learning machine is a machine learning method based on feedforward neural network proposed by Huang [45] in order to improve the backpropagation algorithm and improve the learning efficiency. The network structure of ELM is shown in Fig. 3 . For the ELM network structure with input sample X and hidden layer node number L, the output function can be expressed as: (15) ∑ i = 1 L β i g ( W i · X j + b i ) = o j , j = 1 , . . . , N The goal of ELM network learning is to minimize the error between the expected output and the true value, that is, the error approaches zero infinitely. That is: (16) ∑ j = 1 N o j - t j = 0 Where, t j represents the output of the j sample. As β i , W i and b i exist, so that Eq. (15) can be converted into: (17) ∑ j = 1 L β i g ( W i · X j + b i ) = t j , j = 1 , . . . , N The matrix form is: (18) H β = T Where, H is the output of the hidden layer node; β is the output weight coefficient; T is the expected output. For the input parameter X = [CON1, CON2 HOM1, HOM2, CORR1, CORR2, ASM1, ASM2] is said by the above mentioned four directions are related to the four nonlinear characteristics of the mean and standard deviation; Y represents the corresponding frosting state, which can be expressed as frostless, light frost or heavy frost state in the ternary classification, and whether defrost operation is required in the binary classification. The learning algorithm of ELM can be summarized into the following steps: 1. Determine the number of neurons in the hidden layer, randomly set the connection weight w between the input layer and the hidden layer and the threshold of the neurons in the hidden layer b ; 2. Select an infinite differentiable function as the activation function of the hidden layer neurons, and then calculate the hidden layer output matrix H ; 3. Calculate the output layer weight β ^ : β ^ = H + T ; H + is the Moore-Penrose generalized inverse matrix of matrix H , and T is the desired output. 2.4 Classification evaluation index The accuracy rate, precision rate, recall rate and F1-Score extended from the confusion matrix as evaluation indicators were used to verify the quality of the model. The confusion matrix map is shown in Fig. 4 , which is true positive, true negative, false positive and false negative. True positives mean that the prediction of the class is positive and the prediction result is correct. False positives mean that the result of the class is predicted to be positive and the predicted result is wrong. The same applies to true negatives and false negatives. The calculation formula of the extended classification evaluation index is expressed as follows: a. Accuracy: the proportion of all correct results of the classification model to the total predictors. (19) Accuracy = TP + T N TP + T N + F P + F N b. Precision: in the model prediction is Positive, the proportion of the model prediction pair. (20) Precision = TP TP + F P c. Sensitivity (Recall): The proportion of the model-predicted pair among all outcomes where the true value is Positive. (21) Sensitivity = R e c a l l = TP TP + F N d. F1-Score: F1-Score is the harmonic mean of Precision and Recall; In general, when F1-Score is higher, the test method is more effective. (22) F 1 _ S c o r e = 2 P R P + R where P is the Precision and R is the Recall. 2.5 The proposed OGLCM-ELM method Based on the proposed OGLCM-ELM method, an identification and classification model of the frosting state of the ASHP\u2019s evaporator can be established to realize the defrosting control of the ASHP system. The flow chart of the defrosting control method of the ASHP is shown in Fig. 5 . The implementation steps of this program are: 1. Use the image sensor to collect the image signal of the evaporator fin surface under different operating conditions of the evaporator; 2. Use image preprocessing technology to preprocess the image, and extract the features of the image data by using the statistical method of OGLCM to obtain data samples. Correctly classify and divide samples into training samples and test samples; 3. Build the ELM network structure, determine the relevant parameters, and establish the ELM classifier; 4. Input the training samples into the ELM classifier to obtain appropriate input weights and thresholds; 5. Input the test sample into the trained model to get the recognition result; 6. Collect and process the surface images of the evaporator fins in the running state, and input them into the ELM classifier model to identify the frosting state. 3 Experimental systems and method 3.1 System and devices To verify and study the accuracy and feasibility of the proposed method, experimental system simulating the frosting of air source heat pump heat exchanger is built. The whole experimental system is divided into three parts: indoor A, outdoor B, and control room C, as shown in Fig. 6 . Areas A and B are set as closed-cell micro-environment laboratories, which can simulate indoor and outdoor environments by controlling temperature and humidity. The air source heat pump indoor unit and temperature control device are placed in area A; the tested outdoor unit, temperature control device, humidifier, monitoring camera, and image acquisition module are placed in area B. It is equipped with a 5-megapixel CMOS camera and an image acquisition system. The detailed information of experimental apparatus and measurement devices are given in Table 1 and Table2 . 3.2 Experimental procedure Using the above air-source heat pump frosting simulation experimental system, frosting experiments are conducted under five different outdoor temperatures (−10 °C, −13 °C, −15 °C, −17 °C, −20 °C). According to the degree of frost blocking between the heat exchanger fins and the system performance, the frosting state is divided into three classifications: frostless, light frost and heavy frost. In this study, frostless dataset and light-frost dataset are also merged to form positive dataset, for which defrosting operation is not needed. Then the heavy-frost dataset, namely the negative dataset, indicates the defrosting operation is needed. Shooting angle and lighting condition are randomly changed during the experiment, as shown in Table 3 . The specific experimental steps are as follows: 1. Check the experimental equipment, confirm the safety, and start the experimental operation. 2. Turn on the temperature control device, humidifier and data acquisition unit. Set camera shooting angle and light intensity. Ambient temperature in area A is maintained at 35 °C and temperature in area B gradually drops. 3. When the ambient temperature in area B drops to the target temperature and relative humidity is higher than 90%, turn on the air-source heat pump. The temperature controlling error does not exceed 0.5 °C; 4. As the heat pump operates, the frost layer begins to grows on the clean fin surface, being thicker. At the same time, image acquisition was performed every 180 s until gaps between fins are completely occupied by frost. 5. Stop data collection and temperature control. Start heat pump defrost operation. 6. Set new target temperature in area B. Set new camera shooting angle and light intensity. Repeat step 2\u20135. 4 Results and discussion 4.1 Data analysis and recognition results (ternary classification) Experimental data of this work is mainly the evaporator images. So data reduction of this work is firstly checking and removing invalid samples, and secondly labeling the images with frost state. According to this process, a total of 683 images with different pixels were obtained, including 219 for the frostless state (label 1), 251 for the light frost state (label 2), and 213 for the heavy frost state (label 3), as shown in Table 4 (ternary classification). The data set is randomly divided into a training set containing 80% data and a test set with 20% data. The study is conducted with MATLAB 2020a on a PC (i7 2.38GHZ, 16GRAM). There are some key hyperparameters in the OGLCM-ELM model, such as the node number and activation function of the hidden layer in machining learning, as well as the selection of image gray g, scanning Angle and generation step d when calculating GLCM, which affect the classification results. Therefore, the sensitivity analysis for node number (1 ∼ 500) and activation function (sigmoidal, sine function, Hardlim, Triangular, and Radial basis function) are firstly conducted, according to the method proposed in Section 2. The results are shown in Fig. 7 and Table 5 , which indicate sig function, tribas function and radbas function have outstanding performance, and the highest recognition rate can reach more than 97%. Considering the simplicity and calculation time cost, the activation function of ELM network structure is determined to be sig function with hidden layer nodes of 120. Sensitivity analysis and optimization of image gray level g (from 8 to 256) and generation step d (from 1 to 4) for GLCM are conducted secondly. The results are shown in Fig. 8 , which shows that when the value of the image gray level g is smaller, the recognition accuracy is higher, especially when the image gray level g value is 8, 16, and 32. With g = 8 and d = 3, the method reveals the highest accuracy and smallest error, as well as low calculating complexity. Therefore, the parameter combinations of g = 8 and d = 3 is selected. The corresponding extracted grayscale texture feature vector is shown in Fig. 9 . Using the selected optimal parameters, the recognition accuracy of the extracted feature vectors for different frost degrees is obtained and shown in Fig. 10 . It can be seen from that after 10 repetitions of training, the recognition rates of the ELM model for the training set and test set in the frostless state are 99.66% and 99.54% respectively. And those of light frost and heavy frost states are 96.06% and 95.89%, and 99.64% and 98.22%, respectively. The recognition accuracy for frostless state and heavy frost state is very high, while the recognition accuracy for the light frost state is slightly lower. That\u2019s because misclassification easily occurs between adjacent frost degrees, as the data samples of early light frost state are easily misclassified as the frostless state, and the data samples in the late light frost state are easily misclassified as heavy frost state. Generally, among existing technologies, the high recognition accuracy of OGLCM-ELM is outstanding, with the interference of shooting angle, lighting condition, and pixel level. 4.2 Comparison with other network models for ternary classification To further verify the effectiveness of OGLCM-ELM method, comparative analyses against OGLCM-BP with OGLCM-SVM are conducted. It can be seen from Fig. 11 , compared with Fig. 8, the accuracy and error of SVM and BP models both fluctuate greatly. Moreover, in general, the recognition rate of the model increases with the increase of the scanning step size, from Fig. 11. Based on comprehensive consideration, when SVM and BP models have the highest recognition accuracy and the lowest error, the generated step size d is 1 and 3, respectively, and the image gray value g is 16 and 16 respectively. After determining the parameters, the samples are inputted into the ELM, SVM and BP network to obtain the training accuracy, test accuracy, and recognition rate of each frost state. In order to reduce the impact of randomness, all the results are obtained by repeating the operation 10 times. The results of the 10 runs are shown in Fig. 12 , indicating the results of SVM and BP model not only fluctuates greatly, but also are not ideal in most cases. The ELM model is always the most prominent of these methods, and the difference between the results of each run is particularly small. The mean value and standard deviation of operation results are shown in Table 6 . The average test accuracy of ELM model is significantly higher than that of SVM model and BP model, among which the SVM model has the lowest accuracy. It is worth mentioning that both SVM model and BP model have significantly lower recognition accuracy of heavy frost status than other frost status, while ELM model has a recognition rate of up to 99.71% in heavy frost status. The classification results of frost free and light frost are also better than those of other models. In 10 trials, the test time of different methods is shown in Fig. 13 It can be seen that ELM has the lowest test time, with an average test time of 1.40 ms. Although the test time required by SVM is short, it can be seen from Fig. 12 that its recognition accuracy is the lowest, because the final decision function in the SVM model is only determined by a small number of support vectors, and the computational complexity depends on the number of support vectors rather than the spatial dimension of the sample, but it is difficult to solve the multi-classification problem. Although the recognition accuracy of BP can reach 94.72 ± 3.34%, its test time is two orders of magnitude longer than that of SVM and ELM. This may be because BP neural network has strong nonlinear mapping ability and flexible network structure, but its convergence needs at least hundreds or even thousands of times each time. This makes it slow to learn and prone to falling into local minima. The convergence process of the three methods under ternary classification condition training is shown in Fig. 14 . It is worth noting that SVM is convergent at the beginning, but has a large error (7.35%). This is because the parameters in SVM are pre-set, without changing. After 250 iterations, the training error of ELM remains unchanged for the first time (1.42%). It must be pointed out that the proposed method not only can obtain higher accuracy with less time, but also has room for improvement in future study. In order to further prove the effectiveness of the proposed OGLCM-ELM method, the classification evaluation index introduced in Section 2.4 was used to evaluate the performance of the model. Table 7 shows the results of the 10 runs. In contrast, the accuracy of ELM network is 5.54% and 3.30% higher than that of SVM and BP network, respectively. The average precision is improved by 5.98% and 3.68%, respectively. The sensitivity is increased by 5.31% and 3.34% on average, respectively. The average increases in F1-Score are 5.51% and 3.41%, respectively. In addition, the results of SVM and BP network fluctuated greatly, especially the BP model's recall error of heavy frost state reached 6.40%. The performance is unstable, which is unfavorable for subsequent defrosting control. In the ELM model, the sensitivity rate of frostless state and heavy frost state can reach 100%, being significantly higher than the results reported in literature [39]. It also indicates the method can quickly identify the frost state on the surface of the heat pump heat exchanger under different frost thickness. 4.3 Comparison with other network models for binary classification As practical application only cares about defrosting or not, the data sample set is divided into positive set and negative set (binary classification). The positive sample set consists of frost-free and light-frost images, for which defrosting operation is not needed. While, the negative set of heavy-frost images indicates defrosting operation is needed. The image numbers of positive and negative datasets are 470, and 213, respectively. After repeating the above operations, the re-divided data sets are put into the SVM, BP, and ELM models for identification. In Fig. 15 , when SVM, BP and ELM models have the highest recognition accuracy and the lowest error, the generated step size d is 3, 4 and 4 respectively; the value of the image gray level g is 8, 8, 8 respectively. The results of the 10 runs are shown in Fig. 16 . In 10 experiments, the accuracy of SVM model, BP model and ELM model increased by about 4.95%, 7.15% and 0.77%, respectively, compared with that of various frosting states. The mean value and standard deviation of operation results are shown in Table 8 . The ELM model is still significantly higher than the other two models, with the highest accuracy (98.09%) and the smallest error (±0.88%), among which, the identification accuracy of the model for positive and negative samples is more than 98.48%. It is worth mentioning that the SVM model has a recognition error of about 15% for positive and negative samples. On the one hand, this phenomenon may be caused by the imbalance in the number of positive and negative sample data, which makes the learning rate of this method for negative samples insufficient. Subsequent studies should collect more data. On the other hand, the reason may be that the extracted feature vectors are not simple linear relations and the SVM model used is not suitable for nonlinear mapping relations. The subsequent research should consider introducing kernel function to solve such problems. In 10 trials, the test time results of the three models are shown in Fig. 17 . Among them, the time of SVM and ELM model is in the same order of magnitude. The average test time of SVM model is 3.269 ms, that of ELM model is 1.445 ms, and that of BP model is 147.581 ms. Therefore, the ELM model is superior to other models both in terms of accuracy and testing time. Fig. 18 shows the training process of the three methods for binary classification. The proposed method is very close to the final results at the beginning, and almost reaches complete convergence after 125 iterations, with an accuracy of 99.82%. The convergence of SVM remains unchanged for the same reason as Fig. 14. The accuracy of BP model converges quickly but is finally larger than ELM. In order to further prove the reliability of the ELM model, we also conducted performance evaluation of the model, and the evaluation results are shown in Table 9 . It can be seen from Table 9 that the ELM model is superior to the other two models in performance parameters, and its smallest fluctuation and the maximum error is only ± 0.60%. Compared with the SVM model, the accuracy rate, precision rate, sensitivity and F1-Score of the ELM model are improved by 5.95%, 6.89%, 15.28% and 10.39%, respectively. Compared with BP model, the accuracy rate, precision rate, sensitivity and F1-Score increased by 2.05%, 2.72%, 5.89% and 4.10%, respectively. To sum up, the ELM model has the highest recognition rate, the smallest error and the smallest fluctuation compared with other models in binary classification, showing method is effective. 5 Conclusion To improve the low performance of existing defrost control method with image processing under complex operating conditions (different shooting angles, lighting conditions, and pixel levels), a new method, combining optimized gray level co-occurrence matrix, new characterization parameter combination, and extreme learning machine algorithm (OGLCM-ELM) is proposed and studied. Several important conclusions can be drawn. 1. An experimental rig is set up to model evaporator frosting state under different air temperatures. Based on it, image sample set with different lighting intensity, shooting angle and pixel level are obtained, for the validation and study of the proposed method. 2. For binary classification (Positive set: frostless and light frost; Negative set: heavy frost), the average accuracy of OGLCM-ELM is as high as 98.94%±0.18, being significantly higher than traditional methods (their accuracy is usually around 58 ∼ 75% under complex working condition). 3. For ternary classification (Frostless, light frost, and heavy frost), the average accuracy of OGLCM-ELM reaches 98.14%, being 5.28% and 3.14% higher than those of OGLCM-SVM, OGLCM-BP, respectively. And the calculating time and other performance parameters of OGLCM-ELM are also significantly higher than other methods. The outstanding performance of OGLCM-ELM, which reaches almost 99% accuracy for complex operating condition, indicates it is a practical and potential technology for defrost control. It should be also pointed out that the current work doesn\u2019t include all environmental conditions, which should be considered in future study.

        "dc:description": "Defrost control using digital image processing is a potential, economical, and energy-saving solution for air-source heat pump or refrigeration system, comparing with currently studied or used direct/indirect measuring methods. However, under complex operating condition of different shooting angles, lighting conditions, and pixel level, which are common in refrigeration system, the accuracy of frost state recognition with existing digital image processing methods decrease dramatically. Therefore, a new method based on optimized gray level co-occurrence matrix and new characterization parameter combination to extract image texture characteristics, combining extreme learning machine algorithm (OGLCM-ELM), is proposed for the first time. An experimental rig for evaporator frosting image under different lighting intensity, shooting angle and pixel level is set up. The collected experimental image data are divided into 3 classifications (Frostless, light frost, and heavy frost) or 2 classifications ((Frostless + light frost, and heavy frost)). The results show for ternary classification, OGLCM-ELM reveals significantly higher recognition accuracy then existing methods, average accuracy is as higher as 98.14%. It is also 5.28% and 3.14% higher than those of OGLCM-SVM, OGLCM-BP. Other performance parameters, precision, recall, F1-score, and calculating time are also totally better than other methods. For binary classification. the average accuracy of OGLCM-ELM even reaches 99% under complex operating condition, indicating it is a practical and potential technology for defrost control.",
