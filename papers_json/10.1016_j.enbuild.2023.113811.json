As smart thermostats become increasingly available in residential buildings, there is an opportunity to use measured building data to calibrate models for community and district applications, instead of relying on high-fidelity simulations. This study used smart thermostat data from 60,000 houses in North America to create single-zone models. The model structure was defined with an automated forward selection procedure. 61% of the final models were classified as good fits and the structure of 80% of them was of 5th-order (5 thermal capacitances). An investigation of the 24-hour prediction error of the models showed that the ones classified as good fits are accurate enough for day-ahead predictions and Model Predictive Control (MPC) applications. An analysis of the model parameters suggested no strong correlation between them and the available metadata. The time constants of the houses were estimated, providing valuable information about the houses thermal inertia. Building models that can accurately capture and leverage building thermal inertia are ideal candidates for MPC and energy flexibility applications.

Advanced building control strategies, such as Model Predictive Control (MPC), have been identified as suitable candidates for this challenge because they can leverage energy flexible technologies, such as thermal [4] and electrical [5] energy storage, and facilitate the transactive interaction of buildings with the utility grid [6]. The International Energy Agency's Energy in Buildings and Communities (IEA-EBC) Annex 67 \u201cEnergy Flexible Buildings\u201d defined energy flexibility as \u201cthe ability to manage the demand and generation according to climate conditions, user needs, and energy network requirements\u201d [7]. Dozens of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) can be used to characterize energy flexibility. In most cases, this quantification takes place in comparison with a baseline or benchmark [8]. For example, Athienitis et al. [9] defined the average dynamic Building Energy Flexibility Index (BEFI) for time t and duration Δt as shown in Equation (1), where Q ref is the total power consumption under a reference energy consumption profile and Q flex is the total power consumption of the flexible strategy (e.g., an MPC strategy). (1) B E F I Δ t ( t ) = ∫ t t + Δ t Q r e f ( t ) d t − ∫ t t + Δ t Q f l e x ( t ) d t Δ t Energy and demand flexibility are tightly connected to Demand Side Management (DSM), an encompassing name given to techniques that aim to modify customer load patterns, and more specifically to its Demand Response (DR) aspect, which offers incentives to the customers to encourage change in their consumption patterns [10]. 1.1 Literature review Both MPC strategies and energy flexibility applications rely on building models. In the former case, the building model is necessary to obtain the optimal control; in the latter, the model is used to estimate the reference and flexible power profiles needed to quantify energy flexibility [11] (e.g., Q ref and Q flex in Equation (1)). 1.1.1 Building modeling methods Building thermal models are traditionally categorized in the scientific literature as white-box, black-box and grey-box models [12]. White-box models use mathematical equations based on fundamental physical principles to model the energy response of a building. The parameters of these models are user-defined based on information (either available or assumed) about the building, such as geometry, construction materials, equipment, etc. Most Building Performance Simulation tools, like EnergyPlus and TRNSYS, use high-fidelity, detailed white-box models. White-box models can be extremely accurate, but they are time-consuming to calibrate and require the expertise of an engineer, which often involves high costs [13]. Moreover, necessary information for their calibration is frequently not available, leading to assumptions that can compromise the model accuracy [14]. On the other hand, black-box models are purely data-driven relationships between inputs and outputs, ranging from simple statistical regressions to complex machine learning algorithms [15]. Black-box models are trained on measured data, can be greatly accurate, and they do not need engineering expertise during their training [16]. The growing availability of machine learning methods has also contributed to the popularity of black-box models. However, black-box models lack interpretability and do not guarantee the ability to extrapolate to situations not captured in the training dataset or from building to building [17]. During the last few years, there has been significant effort to constrain the parameters of black-box models to \u201cphysical\u201d bounds and improve their interpretability, but such research is still at the early stages [18,19]. Grey-box models are a compromise between white-box and black-box models. They have a simplified structure that has physical meaning (like white-box models), but their parameters are calibrated with measured data (like black-box models). Grey-box models are often represented using a resistance-capacitance (RC) analogy, or \u201cthermal network\u201d [20]. Their simplified structure makes them much easier and faster to calibrate than white-box models, while at the same time, they have a better extrapolation ability than black-box models [21]. Grey-box models are arguably better candidates than both white- and black-box models for MPC and flexibility assessment. Compared to white-box models, they require less computational power to calibrate and are easier to integrate into an MPC framework, while compared to black-box models, grey-box models require fewer data and have the significant advantage of providing insight into the thermal behavior of the building [22]. 1.1.2 Large-scale modeling of buildings A critical challenge when modeling buildings at a district or community level is the characterization of the dynamic response of buildings on a large scale. In this case the models are called Urban Building Energy Models (UBEM), and they are bottom-up, physics-based models that simulate the thermal performance usually on a building-to-building basis [23]. UBEMs rely on the development of architectural building archetypes, which are physics-based representations (usually high-fidelity white-box models) that simulate single buildings as generalizable typical samples of an entire building stock [24]. Such a building archetype is often generated by sampling building parameters from available distributions or databases [6]. For example, several studies (e.g., [25\u201327]) have used the TABULA database [28], which clusters residential buildings based on size and age and includes typical building material values for various European countries. Similar studies in North America (e.g., [29,30]) use ResStock [31], a building stock energy model based on millions of EnergyPlus simulations. The high computational cost often associated with these large-scale simulations has also created a need for surrogate models, i.e., fast statistical models that emulate high-fidelity simulations and have been trained on their inputs and outputs [32]. More information on archetype buildings can be found in [33] and a detailed literature review on existing residential high-fidelity building stock classification studies can be found in [34]. Even with archetypes, however, building model parameters often rely on a certain amount of guesswork, e.g., the wall materials and insulation are estimated based on the location and the year of the house. However, with the development of novel technologies, such as the Internet of Things and smart thermostats in particular, a substantial amount of operational data has recently become available. These data can be used to develop and calibrate fast, reduced-order models for control applications (also known as control-oriented models) or UBEM for district-level applications. Using real data to calibrate UBEMs has been proposed as a means to ensure that archetype buildings are in fact representative of a district and to estimate the actual simulation error [35]. Moreover, the lack of control-oriented models has been identified as a significant hurdle for the widespread adoption of MPC solutions at a building level [36]. Some methods for automated model development using smart thermostat data have been published, both for single-zone and multi-zone models. Bacher and Madsen [37] proposed a stochastic model identification and selection procedure for single-zone RC models. They suggested a forward selection procedure using likelihood ratio tests and applied it to an experimental setup. Prívara et al. [38] suggested a two-stage forward RC model selection method for MPC applications. They first selected the inputs and then the states of the model, and then validated the procedure on a two-zone TRNSYS model simulation. Wang et al. [39] proposed a backward RC model selection based on the ratio of parameter standard error over the identified parameter estimate. They applied the methodology to measured data from a low-energy house using one zone per floor. Arroyo et al. [40] presented a forward selection method for multi-zone RC models. They applied their method on an emulator building model implemented in BOPTEST and showed that the multi-zone model can outperform the single-zone model for MPC because it creates less thermal discomfort. Vallianos et al. [41] proposed an automated method for multi-zone RC models for MPC applications that uses both forward and backward selection to ensure proper parameter identification. The Bayesian Information Criterion was used as the evaluation metric and applied the method on measured data from an experimental house. As the number of houses increases, methods that generate models with \u201cvarying\u201d structures require significant computational resources. As a result, most studies that have endeavored to model houses on a large scale have used a fixed model structure. For instance, multiple studies have calibrated first-order models using large smart thermostat datasets [42\u201346]. All these studies employed the same dataset of North American houses. However, these studies focused mostly on time constant estimation, most of them neglecting the effect of solar radiation in the process ([42\u201344,46]). John et al. [42] showed that the time constants vary seasonally, probably as a result of opening and closing windows in response to weather. Doma et al. [44] found the building age to be the most influential factor on time constants, and the number of floors the least influential. Huchuk et al. [45] calibrated control-oriented first-order models for multi-hour predictions and compared it with other data-driven models. They showed that first-order models were outperformed by other models, the order and structure of the model was suggested as the most likely explanation. Hossain et al. [47] used Bayesian Neural Networks based on the nRnC structure of grey-box models to model 8,884 houses in Canada. They used 3 months of data and showed that the 2R2C model performs the best. They also used transfer learning (both across buildings and across seasons), which resulted in models with the same or better accuracy with much fewer data. Leprince et al. [48] used data from 247 Dutch houses to calibrate stochastic single-zone models. They used the method presented in [37] and they proposed a new evaluation metric, the normalized Cumulative Periodogram Boundary Excess Sum (nCPBES), which indicates the residual auto-correlation. Based on nCPBES they classified their models as good (38%), close (38%), and poor (24%). They used the identified parameters to benchmark the building envelope insulation performance. They also published the calibrated model parameters [49]. Vallianos et al. [50] calibrated models for 7,800 houses in Québec and Ontario, Canada for 24-hour predictions and assessed MPC on a large scale. They used second-order models, and tested the effect of training length and calibration horizon on the 24-hour prediction accuracy of the models. They used the existing dynamic pricing and Time-of-Use tariffs to show that MPC shifts the peak power consumption, reducing it by 15% in the case of Ontario and 30% in Québec. If just 1,000 houses adopt MPC the grid could see an average reduction in high-price energy consumption of up to 15 MWh in Ontario and 11 MWh in Québec. Doma and Ouf [46] used data from 60,000 houses in North America to calibrate first-order RC models and estimate their thermal constant. They used only periods during the night, where there are no solar heat gains, and the occupancy gains would be minimal. Then, they clustered the estimated thermal constants into four groups representing the building's need for retrofit. They reported approximately 22,000 reliable models with a median time constant of 51 hours and 90% of the values in the range of 11 to 110 hours. 1.2 Motivation The increasing adoption of smart thermostats facilitates the development of control-oriented thermal models in the residential sector. At the building level, data-driven models can be used for assessment of energy flexibility, DR measures, MPC or other advanced control strategies, fault detection and diagnosis [51,52] or retrofit evaluation [53,54]. At the district level, data-driven models can be used for energy policymaking, assessment of renewable energy penetration potential [55], or assessment energy aggregator performance [56]. The absence of publicly available datasets of control-oriented models was identified as a challenge for large-scale studies. The issue arises from both the lack of an automated method for developing building models using smart thermostat data and the scarcity of measured data itself. This article uses smart thermostat data from 60,000 houses in North America to create single-zone models with an automated forward selection procedure and makes the resulting models publicly available to be used in community and district applications. The models are control-oriented, focusing on scalability, practicality, and simplicity. They only use information available to a smart thermostat, and, although they are physics-based, they focus on accurate predictions and not the evaluation of physical meaning of every single model component. The work adapts the automated model selection and evaluation procedure for stochastic building model identification presented in [48] and applies it on a large dataset of 60,000 houses in North America. The calibrated models are analyzed and the most likely model structures are identified. The ability of the models to be used in MPC applications is evaluated by investigating the 24-hour multi-step prediction error and calculating the time constants of the houses. The full dataset of the resulting models is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8347091 [57], allowing studies on large building stocks to gain access to and sample from building models calibrated from measured data. Section 1 reviewed the literature and presented the motivation behind this work. Section 2 describes the dataset and provides details about the model generation and selection procedure, as well as the evaluation metrics. Section 3 investigates the calibrated models, their accuracy, model parameters and time constants. Lastly, the article concludes with Section 4. 2 Methods This section describes the methods used to develop stochastic RC models from smart thermostat data. In general, this method modifies the work of Bacher and Madsen [37] for model generation and Leprince et al. [48] for automatic model selection. Section 2.1 describes the available data, the preprocessing procedure and the final dataset. Section 2.2 outlines the RC model used to represent each house, its components and the equations defining the heat transfer. Finally, Section 2.3 presents the forward selection procedure and the evaluation metrics. 2.1 Data description and selection This study uses data from thousands of houses in North America, provided by Ecobee, a smart thermostats company based in Toronto, Canada. Ecobee offers the Donate Your Data (DYD) [58] program to their customers, allowing them to donate an anonymized dataset of the data logged by their thermostats. The dataset is the same one used in [42\u201347,50]. Each house is equipped with one or more thermostats. Each Ecobee thermostat collects measurements of indoor temperature value and upper and lower setpoint, relative humidity value and upper and lower setpoint, runtime of the heating and cooling systems equipment (in seconds) and motion. The data are sampled every 5 minutes. The dataset also includes a \u201ccontrol\u201d temperature, which is an aggregated temperature from all the available thermostats used to compare against the setpoints, and the outdoor temperature of the closest weather station. The control temperature is often the average of the individual zone temperatures, but it can also be a weighted average based on user input. The dataset also comes with metadata provided by the user, which includes information about the country, province/state, and city of the house, the floor area and age of the house, the number of occupants and floors, the style of the house, whether it has a heat pump, and whether the house uses natural gas or electricity for heating. Approximately 20% of the houses are equipped with a heat pump, while the rest 80% are heated with natural gas. A breakdown of the metadata information (after preprocessing) is shown in Fig. 1 . It is worth noticing that, since the metadata are provided by the user, they included erroneous, missing, or heterogeneous values. Approximately 500 houses were excluded as outliers for having more than 6 occupants, or more than 4 floors. The house style was homogenized (e.g., \u201ccondominium\u201d, \u201cCondominium\u201d, and \u201ccondo\u201d to \u201cCondo\u201d). House style \u201cOther\u201d included missing values as well as answers like \u201cI don't know\u201d, \u201c0\u201d, or \u201cOFF\u201d. Additionally, two home styles, \u201cLoft\u201d and \u201cMultiplex\u201d were included in \u201cOther\u201d, as they included less than 1% of the homes. Similarly, the \u201cother\u201d climate category consisted of 10 climate zones that each included less than 1% of the houses. An important piece of information missing from the dataset is the solar radiation, a major disturbance in building energy modeling. The city, province/state, and country were used to find the approximate latitude and longitude of each location through geopy [59], using the Nominatim Application Programming Interface (API) [60]. Then, the latitude and longitude of each location were used to fetch the historical global horizontal solar irradiance data from the National Solar Radiation Database of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory of the U.S. Department of Energy, using their API [61]. The irradiance has units of W/m2 and its temporal resolution is either 5 minutes or 30 minutes, depending on the location and the year. The 30-minute data were interpolated to 5-minute intervals. The latitude and longitude of each location were also used to retrieve its Köppen Geiger climate zone classification [62], which was made available on arcGIS by Commission for Environmental Cooperation (CEC) [63] and was accessed using the arcGIS python API. Fig. 2 shows the location of the used houses, along with their climate zone classification. The available dataset includes data from approximately 100,000 houses in the United States and Canada, spanning the years from 2015 to 2021. Around 5,000 houses with typos or missing information regarding their location were excluded, since the location is necessary to retrieve historical solar irradiance data. Moreover, the nature and resolution of the dataset makes missing values unavoidable, so for each house only the periods that contain consecutive data of more than 30 days are considered. The final dataset includes approximately 60,000 houses. Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 show that although there are houses all over North America, they are more densely distributed on the east side, where the houses are both more in quantity and better dispersed on the map. That is also reflected on the climate zone classification, where zones Cfa (temperate, without dry season, hot summer) and Dfa (cold, without dry season, hot summer) are prevalent. Observing the rest of the metadata, the house styles are also biased towards detached homes, and the prevalent number of occupants is 0, which could indicate missing information. The house age, floor area and number of floors are fairly well distributed. 2.2 Model structure Each house can be modeled as single equivalent zone, using the \u201ccontrol\u201d temperature T i already calculated by the thermostats. This temperature acts as an equivalent zone temperature and is compared to the setpoints and used to define the runtime of the HVAC system. However, the actual structure and order of the single-zone model can range from a simple first-order model that only models the indoor air temperature to a more complicated fifth-order model that models the heat capacity of various elements of the house and the heat transfer between them. The model structures and selection procedure are based on [37] and is similar to the ones used in [48]. The full model is shown in Fig. 3 . The model can have up to 5 states: \u2022 T i (°C) is the effective indoor air temperature. \u2022 T m (°C) is the effective temperature of the interior thermal mass. \u2022 T e (°C) is the effective temperature of the building envelope mass. \u2022 T h (°C) is the effective temperature of the heater(s). \u2022 T s (°C) is the effective temperature of the sensor(s). Each state is associated with an equivalent thermal capacitance C (J/°C), while R (°C/W) denotes the thermal resistance between two nodes that defines the thermal exchange between them. T a (°C) is the ambient temperature, Q h (W) is the total heating output, α (m2) is a solar factor, which includes solar aperture, and Q sol is the solar horizontal irradiance (W/m2). All the available model parameters are presented and explained in Table 1 . The different components of the model are shown with different colors in Fig. 3. The full model includes all the components showed and is denoted T i T m T e T h T s α e α i R ia . The simplest model is T i and includes only parameters C i , R ia and α i . The structure of the final model is decided automatically through a forward selection procedure. A detailed explanation on the different model components and the forward selection procedure is presented in Section 2.3. The heat transfer dynamics are represented by the stochastic continuous state-space equations showed in Equation (2), where ω represents a standard Wiener process and σ represents the incremental variance of the Wiener process, which includes any thermal dynamics phenomena not captured by the rest of the model.

The optimal parameters of the model can be identified as the parameters that maximize the joint probability density (4) L ( θ ; Y k ) = ( ∏ k = 1 N p ( Y k | Y k − 1 , θ ) ) p ( Y 0 | θ ) where p ( Y 0 | θ ) denotes the initial conditions, Y k represents all observations from the initial condition to timestep k and θ are the model parameters. p ( Y k | Y k − 1 , θ ) represents the conditional density probability of observing Y k given the specific parameters and all the previous observations until that timestep. Equation (4) can be estimated by a Kalman filter and then maximized by an optimization function to yield the final parameter estimates θ \u204e . The parameter estimation was performed in programming language R [64], through the package CTSMR [65], a package developed by Technical University of Denmark Compute for Continuous Time Stochastic Modeling, which estimates model parameters for timeseries data. For more information on continuous stochastic modeling for buildings and CTSMR specifically, the reader is referred to the work of Kristensen and Madsen [66], Kristensen et al. [67], Bacher and Madsen [37], and Leprince et al. [48]. The smart thermostats do not measure the heating output itself, but only the total runtime of the heating or cooling system. There is no information about the total installed capacity Q nom of the systems, and including it as a parameter to be calibrated in Equation (2) guarantees that the models are overparameterized and could pose challenges to the optimization and the effective parameter estimation. For that reason the stochastic equations are expressed in the form shown in Equation (5), where the parameters that can be identified are not the actual values of capacitances and resistances, but their ratios and products, i.e., C i , C s and R is cannot be identified separately, but C i /C s and R is C i can. In this manner, the ratio Q nom /C i can be identified and used in combination with δ, which denotes the runtime of the heating or cooling system. (5) d T s = C i C s ⋅ T i − T s R i s C i d t + σ s d ω s d T m = C i C m ⋅ T i − T m R i m C i d t + σ m d ω m d T h = C i C h ⋅ T i − T h R i h C i d t + C i C h ⋅ Q n o m C i δ d t + σ h d ω h d T e = C i C e ⋅ T i − T e R i e C i d t + T a − T e R e a C e d t + C i C e ⋅ α e C i Q s o l d t + σ e d ω e d T i = T s − T i R i s C i d t + T m − T i R i m C i d t + T h − T i R i h C i d t + T e − T i R i e C i d t + T a − T i R i a C i d t + α i C i Q s o l d t + σ i d ω i The model parameters vary throughout the day due to occupant activities. For example, if the occupants open a window, the effective thermal resistance of the air zone to the outdoors will decrease. Another example is solar factors, which will vary throughout the day or even the season. The effect of global horizontal irradiance on the heat gains is influenced by the orientation of the house and its windows, as well as the position of the sun during the day. The effect of the solar radiation could be modeled in more detail by using a time-variant solar factor, or even using B-splines as described in [68]. Using time-variant model parameters may increase the model accuracy, but can increase complexity and computational resources exponentially. As in most studies in the reviewed literature, the model parameters are assumed to be time-invariant in this study, prioritizing simplicity and speed over improved accuracy. 2.3 Model selection The structure of the model is decided automatically by a forward selection procedure. The procedure starts with the simplest model, T i , and iteratively adds complexity by adding one component at a time. For every new model, a statistical test is performed; a likelihood ratio test that establishes whether the more complex model is statistically significantly better than the simpler one. The procedure is shown schematically in Fig. 4 and the components can be seen with different colors in Fig. 3. The available components include the 5 states T i , T e , T m , T s , T h , the solar factors α i and α e , and the infiltration R ia . When the state of the building envelope mass T e is included, the parameter R ia which expresses the heat exchange between indoor air and outdoor air is discarded, because it is assumed that heat transfer occurs through the envelope mass. The parameter R ia is then introduced as a separate component in the following iterations to represent infiltration. Similarly, the initial inclusion of the state of the building envelope mass T e does not include a solar factor α e , because the solar effect is included on the interior air node. In the following iterations, a component α e is introduced that can be included to substitute α i . In turn, if component α e is included, α i is added as a component in the following iterations, allowing the effect of solar radiation on both the envelope and the interior node. During every iteration, all models of the iteration are identified and statistically compared to the base model. The model with the lowest p-value is considered the best candidate, and the procedure moves to the next iteration. If none of the candidate models has a p-value below a 5% threshold then the procedure stops and the last model is the final model. The accuracy of the final building model can be evaluated using root mean square error (RMSE) or the mean absolute error (MAE), the goodness of fit (FIT) and the coefficient of determination (R2) [36,38]. The goodness of fit (FIT) is 1 - NRMSE, where NRMSE is the Normalized Root Mean Squared Error, and it is a percentage that expresses how good the model predictions are, with 100% meaning that the model explains even the system noise [39]. These metrics essentially evaluate how close the predicted values are to the available data. The choice of which criterion to use is often dictated by the application. Another way to evaluate whether the model captures building thermal dynamics properly is to test the residuals for whiteness, since the model structure assumes white-noise residuals [69]. This is often done using the auto-correlation function (ACF) and cumulative periodogram (CP) of the residuals. The CP is a Fourier transformation of the autocovariance function of a stationary process. If the model residuals correspond to white noise, then the CP should be a straight line. The ACF represents the same concept as the CP, but in the time domain instead of the frequency domain. Leprince et al. [48] extended the evaluation phase of [37] by introducing the normalized Cumulative Periodogram Boundary Excess Sum, or nCPBES, facilitating the automated evaluation of building models. The nCPBES is essentially the sum of all the instances where the CP of the residuals exceeds the boundaries where white-noise residuals would (statistically) reside. They used threshold values of 0.01 and 0.03 to classify models to three categories: \u201cgood\u201d, \u201cclose\u201d, and \u201cpoor\u201d fits. This work uses the nCPBES with the same thresholds to check the whiteness of the residuals and differentiate between the three categories, as well as the RMSE of multi-step predictions as evaluation metrics. 3 Results and discussion This section presents and discusses the results of thermally characterizing 59,794 houses in North America. The calibrated models are presented and evaluated and their parameters are closely investigated. 3.1 Model evaluation The final resulting models are shown in Fig. 5 . By far, the most likely model structure was T i T m T e T h T s α e , which accounted for almost 50% of the final models. Overall, 80% of the final models were of 5th order and an additional 15% are of 4th order. The fact that models of higher order were much more prevalent highlights that more detailed models are more likely to capture house thermal dynamics of single-zone houses better, but does not necessarily mean that models of lower order would not have adequate accuracy. Traditionally, lower-order models are preferred due to their simplicity in the calibration process, but an automated model selection process such as the one proposed mitigates the challenge. The nCPBES was used to classify models into good, close, or poor, as explained in Section 2.3. An nCPBES that is not 0 suggests that there are still some thermal dynamics that are not being captured by the model. That is expected since the models do not include any information regarding occupancy or use of appliances and internal loads, which would not typically be accessible on such a large scale. As seen in Fig. 5, from the total of 60,000 models, 61% were classified as good fits, 28% were classified as close fits and 11% were classified as poor fits. The equivalent multi-step prediction RMSE is shown in Fig. 6 in the form of letter-value plots. Letter-value plots are an alternative to boxplots, which is more suitable for large-scale data [70]. The widest box represents 50% of the datapoints, and every box width after that contains half of the rest of the data. Fig. 6 shows that the RMSEs followed on average the classification of the models based on nCPBES, with good models being consistently more accurate than close models, which in turn were more accurate than poor models. Moreover, the figure shows that 50% of the produced good models had a 24-hour RMSE of less than 1.35°C and 80% of them less than 2°C, proving that the models were accurate enough and suitable for day-ahead MPC applications. The forward model selection procedure for all houses is shown in Fig. 7 . During the first iterations, the selection procedure preferred models that include states T s and T h , with model T i T m T e T h T s being the most likely by the 4th iteration. After the model reached the 5th order it was fine-tuned with the addition of infiltration or solar factors on the envelope instead of the air node, or on both. Very few models (only 0.4%) reached the full configuration. 3.2 Parameter investigation of 5th-order models The 5th-order models accounted for 80% of all the final models. This section investigates their model parameters in an effort to evaluate the models, find patterns, or correlate them with the available metadata. Fig. 8 shows histograms of the calibrated parameters of the 29,500 5th-order models that were classified as good fits. At first glance, the thermal capacitance ratios seem to make physical sense, with the thermal capacitance of the building materials C e being 1 to 4 orders of magnitude higher than C i , the capacitance of the interior thermal mass C m is 1 to 2 orders of magnitude higher, while the capacitance of the heater C h and the sensor C s are 1 to 2 orders of magnitude lower than C i . The envelope node parameters seemed to gravitate towards two distinct local minima areas. One is close to the lower bound of C i /C e , which corresponds to the smaller peak of R ea C i and the values at the upper limit of α e /C i . The second is close to 0.1 C i /C e and corresponds to the larger peak of R ea C i and the middle values of α e /C i . Parameters R is C i , R ih C i , and R ia C i were concentrated at their upper bounds at 3, 6, and 24 hours respectively, while parameter α i /C i was stuck at the lower bound. Running the calibration procedure with higher upper bounds had minimal effect on the model accuracy or T i , but it did make the parameters stick to the new upper bound, also affecting parameters C i /C h and C i /C s . It seems that the many degrees of freedom in the parameter space can lead the calibration to fine tune the parameters to non-physical values, stressing the importance and need for proper parameter bounds. It is not expected that all parameters of all 29,500 models will strictly follow physics. A single-zone representation of a large and diverse space such as a house can make parameter identification challenging. Moreover, missing essential information such as the total heating output, or occupancy and appliance loads can incline the parameter identification towards non-physical values, which can be affected with the careful selection of parameter bounds. The effect of metadata on model parameters was investigated and it is shown in Appendix A. Figs. A.1 and A.3 to A.6 showed absolutely no effect of the style of house, its age, area, number of floors, or number of occupants on the parameter distributions. Fig. A.2 shows a rather small influence of the climate on some of the model parameters, most notably on the parameters related to the envelope node T e . 3.3 Time constant investigation The time constants of each house can be identified by estimating the poles of the transfer functions of the system of equations in Equation (5), or, equivalently the eigenvalues of the state matrix in the state-space representation. For a real and positive pole, the time constant τ is given by Equation (6) [71]: (6) τ = − 1 l n ( p ) Each house has one time constant per state, i.e., per capacitance. The poles of the system were calculated in R using the Package \u201ccontrol\u201d [72]. Therefore, the 5th-order models have 5 time constants: \u2022 Building material time constant τ e : This time constant reflects how quickly the building envelope materials respond to fluctuations in the outdoor temperature and solar radiation. A shorter time constant suggests that the building mass adjusts quickly to changes in outdoor conditions, affecting heat transfer between indoor and outdoor conditions. \u2022 Interior mass time constant τ m : This time constant characterizes the rate that the interior mass (e.g., the floor furniture etc.) of the building adjusts to fluctuations in the temperature of the indoor air, and consequently to heating and cooling. The interior thermal mass behaves like a dedicated thermal battery for the indoor air and its time constant reflects how effectively the building can store heat in its interior and how quickly it can \u201ccharge\u201d or \u201cdischarge\u201d. \u2022 Indoor air time constant τ i : This time constant indicates how fast the indoor air temperature responds to any change in the system, such as outdoor weather conditions or changes in heating and cooling. A shorter time constant means that the indoor air temperature adjusts faster to these changes, which is detrimental to building thermal comfort and its ability to maintain a desired indoor temperature. \u2022 Heater time constant τ h : This time constant reflects how quickly the building heating (or cooling) system reaches its steady-state condition in response to changes in heating (or cooling control). A shorter time constant implies that the heater temperature responds rapidly to changes in heating demands. \u2022 Sensor time constant τ s : This time constant indicates how rapidly the sensor temperature responds to changes in the indoor air temperature. Sensors with shorter time constants may provide quicker feedback about temperature variations. The building material time constant τ e is expected to be the largest, since the envelope materials are usually the most thermally massive part of a house, followed by the interior thermal mass time constant τ m . The heater time constant τ h and the sensor time constant τ s are expected to be the smallest and have a magnitude of just a few minutes. The most important time constants are τ e and τ m , which quantify the ability of a house to store thermal energy and can be very important in studies about energy flexibility potential of a house, and τ i , which is associated closely with occupant thermal comfort. Fig. 9 shows the distributions of the time constants for the 29,500 5th-order models considered a good fit. The building material time constant τ e has a median of 52 hr, with 80% of the points being in the range of 17 to 297 hr. These values are consistent with the overall literature [73]. More specifically, John et al. [42] used a first-order RC model to model 10,000 houses in Canada and found time-constants in the range of 15 to 55 hours, while Doma and Ouf [46] used the same model on 60,000 houses in North America and found time constants in the range of 11 to 110 hours with a median of 51 hours. Vallianos et al. [50] used a second-order model on 7,800 houses in Ontario and Québec and found time constants in the range of 15 to 280 hours, with a median of 100 hours. About 5% of the models have a τ e larger than 1000 hr, indicating that their parameters may not accurately reflect physics. The interior mass time constant τ m is the next largest one with a median of 6 hr, while the indoor air time constant τ i , heater time constant τ h , and sensor time constant τ s all have a median of 10 minutes or less. It should be noted that the sensor time constant τ s is comparable to the sampling time of the smart thermostats (which is 5 minutes), indicating that the sampling time is too short and the data could be resampled to 15-minutes in the modeling and calibration stage. 3.4 Limitations and a note on bias Although the Ecobee dataset is a great source of insight and analysis into building models and characteristics, there are still limitations to this study. The dataset itself is potentially biased towards homeowners and a wealthier subset of population, or even occupants that are more environmentally conscious than the average North American. All houses are equipped with thermostats from the same company, meaning that there could be a form of systematic error on the sensor measurements. Another major limitation of this study is the lack of information about the installed heating and cooling capacity. Had that information been available, all the model parameters would have been identifiable, and not just their products and ratios. 4 Conclusion As smart thermostats become increasingly available in residential buildings, there is an opportunity to use measured building data to calibrate models for community and district applications. To do that, this study used smart thermostat data from 60,000 houses in North America. Each house was modeled as a single-zone. Instead of using a predefined model structure, this work uses an automated forward procedure that increases the complexity of the model structure until its quality cannot increase anymore. The heat transfer dynamics of the house were represented by stochastic continuous state-space equations. The fit of the final models was evaluated, with 61% of the models being classified as good fits. Higher-order models were dominant in the final models, and 80% of the calibrated models were of 5th order. An investigation of the 24-hour multi-step prediction of the models showed that the ones classified as good fits are accurate enough for MPC applications, with 50% of them having a 24-hour RMSE of less than 1.3°C and 80% of them less than 2°C. Insight into the model parameters showed that they are not correlated to the available metadata. The time constants of the houses were estimated and their values agree with expert knowledge. The time constant of the building materials and of internal mass had a median of 52 hours and 6 hours respectively, showcasing the ability of the model to capture the thermal inertia of the house, and therefore to leverage it for advanced control applications. The resulting dataset is publicly available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8347091.

        "dc:description": "As smart thermostats become increasingly available in residential buildings, there is an opportunity to use measured building data to calibrate models for community and district applications, instead of relying on high-fidelity simulations. This study used smart thermostat data from 60,000 houses in North America to create single-zone models. The model structure was defined with an automated forward selection procedure. 61% of the final models were classified as good fits and the structure of 80% of them was of 5th-order (5 thermal capacitances). An investigation of the 24-hour prediction error of the models showed that the ones classified as good fits are accurate enough for day-ahead predictions and Model Predictive Control (MPC) applications. An analysis of the model parameters suggested no strong correlation between them and the available metadata. The time constants of the houses were estimated, providing valuable information about the houses thermal inertia. Building models that can accurately capture and leverage building thermal inertia are ideal candidates for MPC and energy flexibility applications.",
