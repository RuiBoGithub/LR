Table 1 Research on radiant cooling systems in China. Authors City Method Control strategy Main findings Ren et al. [27] Jinan Simulation On-off control A collaborative control strategy using the PMV-based model showed highly efficient cooling and energy conservation potential. Gu et al. [28] Changsha Experiment Multi-zone control A non-centralized hybrid radiant floor cooling system was developed to create high thermal comfort in buildings using multi-zone control. Hu et al. [29] Nanjing Simulation Intermittent operation Energy consumption can be reduced by closing the fresh air system and opening the radiation system. Zhou et al. [30] Shanghai Experiment \u2014\u2014 The radiant floor cooling tends to cause more local discomfort complaints in the feet and calf parts than other radiant heating and cooling systems. Hu et al. [4] Beijing Experiment and simulation Thermostat control Only extending the operating time of the load system can reduce the peak cooling load of the combined system and improve the heat extraction capacity of the active surface. Shen et al. [31] Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou Comprehensive numerical model \u2014\u2014 The performance of the pipe-embedded envelope in the three typical Chinese cities is satisfactory.

School of Thermal Engineering Shandong Jianzhu University Jinan 250101 China The application potential of radiant floor cooling systems is affected by climatic conditions. The meteorological parameters of 22 cities in five climatic zones in China (severe cold (SC), cold, hot summer and cold winter (HSCW), hot summer and warm winter (HSWW), and temperate) are analyzed to evaluate the applicability of four conventional control strategies of radiant floor cooling system in office buildings. The control strategies are modeled in the Transient System Simulation Program (TRNSYS), and the indoor thermal comfort, condensation risk, energy consumption, and carbon emissions are analyzed. Multi criteria decision-making is used to evaluate the radiant floor system. The results show that the control strategy with direct ground cooling produces the highest energy savings in the five climate zones. The energy savings are 25\u201366 % higher than those of the three control strategies using a heat pump as a cold source. Under the same indoor environment conditions, the three-step control strategy provides the optimum indoor temperature and humidity control. The number of hours when the three-step control strategy exceeds the thermal comfort zone is 5 % in 22 cities, and the number of hours with condensation risk is only 3%. The variable water supply temperature control and precooling control have better performance than the other strategies in the SC, cold, and temperate zones. In addition, the control strategies are ranked based on their application potential in 22 cities. The application potential of the radiant floor cooling system with a direct ground cooling source is the highest in the five climate zones in the two scenarios with equal weights of the four criteria and is preferable due to less carbon emissions. When the condensation risk is considered, the radiant floor cooling system with a direct ground cooling source exhibits better performance in the SC and cold zones. The variable water supply temperature control is the optimum strategy in the HSCW, HSWW, and temperate zones. The precooling control strategy ranks the highest in Changchun and Guiyang, and the three-step control strategy performs the best in Shanghai.

In 2021, the space cooling demand experienced the highest annual growth rate of any building end use, and accounted for nearly 16 % of buildings sector final electricity consumption. Energy efficient air conditioning units substantially affect the cooling demand [1]. Radiant cooling systems have been widely used in China in many areas and have proved feasible in many construction fields [2\u20134]. Radiant cooling systems are efficient and reduce building cooling energy consumption [5]. Radiant cooling systems use radiation to replace the convective heat transfer between the human body and the surrounding environment, representing a low-energy alternative to energy-intensive air conditioning systems. Since the system only requires high-temperature cold water, the coefficient of performance of the chiller is high; thus, there is a broad choice of cooling sources, and carbon emissions are low [6\u20138]. The system uses water as a medium, saving building space and reducing noise caused by ventilation. A radiant cooling system can create a more comfortable indoor thermal environment than a traditional air conditioning system [9]. Types of radiant cooling systems include radiant floor, radiant ceiling, and wall panel cooling systems [10,11]. This study focuses on radiant floor cooling systems, where the radiant surface is located in the concrete. These systems were first used for radiant floor heating and were later adapted for cooling by the refrigeration industry. Unlike other radiant cooling systems, the radiant floor cooling system can be used for both cooling and heating; thus, it is favored by people [12]. With the widespread application of radiant floor cooling systems, numerous studies have been conducted. The dynamic performance of radiant floor cooling systems has been continuously improved, but two main problems remain to be solved: indoor thermal comfort and condensation risk on the surface of radiant floor. Memon et al. [13] pointed out that in addition to keeping the temperature of the cooled surfaces above the dew point of the indoor air, adjusting the room\u2019s humidity ratio could reduce the risk of condensation on radiant surfaces. Khan et al. [14] believed that ventilation and dehumidification could prevent condensation and improve indoor air quality. Zarrella et al. [15] compared various dehumidification systems coupled with a radiant floor cooling system using simulations; the results showed that a mechanical ventilation system provided a greater reduction in indoor air humidity ratio and maintained indoor air quality. System optimization is typically carried out during the design of a system control strategy. Adjusting water flow and water temperature are common control strategies for radiant floor systems. Lim et al. [10] analyzed the applicability of conventional control methods to minimize floor condensation and improve comfort using simulations and experiments. The results showed that controlling the water temperature of the radiant system was better than controlling the water flow. Moreover, Arghand et al. [16] conducted experiments to compare water temperature control and water flow control methods for a radiant floor cooling system with direct ground cooling. They suggested using the temperature control method. In addition, Sui et al. [17] used the Transient System Simulation Program (TRNSYS) to study the thermal environment response of the tube-embedded slab cooling system in an office building in China and optimized the strategy. The results showed that an intermittent strategy combined with variable water temperature control could minimize the indoor temperature fluctuations caused by a large change in the outdoor temperature during the cooling season. This system is suitable for different climates and building loads. Gwerder et al. [18] proposed a pulse-width modulation control method to achieve intermittent operation of the water circulating pump combined with controlling the water supply temperature. This strategy met the comfort standards and energy efficiency requirement while reducing the system delivery energy consumption. Systems with algorithm control, such as neural network algorithm control [19] and predictive control [11,20,21], have been used increasingly in radiant floor cooling systems. In addition to optimizing the control system, the utilization of natural cooling sources further enhances the energy-saving potential of the system. Romaní et al. [22] found that a radiant wall system coupled with a ground heat exchanger showed high energy-savings potential in the cooling mode. Ren et al. [23] proposed dynamic optimization control of a radiant floor cooling system combined with direct ground cooling. This system improved indoor comfort while providing energy savings. The choice of air conditioning system significantly affects the building's energy performance and establish up to 90 % of the life time occupants\u2019' satisfaction and building running costs [24]. Many studies have used multi-criteria decision-making to evaluate air conditioning systems. Shahrestani et al. [25] used a fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making model to select a heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system. Balbis-Morejón et al. [26] integrated energy, environmental, and economic factors and proposed the global air conditioning performance indicator based on the analytic hierarchy process to evaluate the air conditioning systems of buildings. Therefore, it is appropriate to use multi criteria decision-making to evaluate radiant floor cooling systems. Table 1 presents some control strategies for a good application prospect. The existing traditional control strategies are often chosen in many engineering design. In addition, many studies were conducted in only one or a few climatic conditions. Due to the diverse climate types in China, it is critical to explore the operating potential of radiant floor cooling systems in different climate zones to provide suggestions for Chinese decision-makers. Therefore, we compare the applicability of radiant floor cooling systems considering the traditional control strategies in five climatic zones in China. Moreover, an appropriate evaluation method for the system in the early stage ensures the subsequent operation of the system. This study uses TRNSYS software to simulate the performances of a radiant floor cooling system with four conventional control strategies in an office building in different climate zones in China. The indoor air temperature stability, indoor thermal comfort, condensation risk, energy consumption and carbon emissions potential of the systems are compared. The simulation results of the system are comprehensively evaluated, and the applicability of the strategies under different climate conditions is discussed. The research results provide a valuable reference for the engineering design of radiant floor cooling systems. 2 Methods 2.1 Study flowchart Fig. 1 shows the flowchart of this study. First, the building parameters are determined, and the simulated weather conditions are selected. Then, according to the four conventional control strategies, the different simulation models of the radiant floor cooling system are established in TRNSYS. Finally, the simulation results are obtained by running the model in TRNSYS. The results are analyzed, and four indicators are selected to evaluate the optimal strategy using multi criteria decision-making. 2.2 Construction of building model and selection of cities 2.2.1 Construction of building model An office building model is established; the three-dimensional diagram of the model is shown in Fig. 2 . Four operating strategies of the radiant floor cooling system are simulated. The building has five floors with a floor height of 3.5 m and a total construction area of 4660 m2; the air-conditioned area is 3695 m2. According to the general specification for building energy efficiency and renewable energy utilization (GB 55015-2021) [32], the internal heat gain schedule of the building is determined (Fig. 3 ). The operating time of the building air conditioner is from 7:00 to 19:00. When the ventilation system is not running, the permeability of the building is considered, and the permeability coefficient is assumed to be 0.5. The occupancy density of the room is 10 m2/person, the lighting power density is 8.0 W/m2, the equipment power density is 15.0 W/m2, the heat transfer coefficient of the external wall is 0.38 W/(m2·K), and the heat transfer coefficient of the roof is 0.89 W/(m2·K). The details of the office and building are listed in Table 2 . These values meet the energy-saving standards of office buildings in various climate zones. 2.2.2 Selection of cities According to the code for the thermal engineering design of civil buildings (GB 50176-2016) [33], where the outdoor air temperature is the main indicator, China is divided into five climate zones: severe cold (SC), cold, hot summer and cold winter (HSCW), hot summer and warm winter (HSWW), and temperate. The five zones have different building design requirements. The SC zone must meet the winter insulation requirements, the cold zone needs to meet the winter insulation requirements and heat insulation in summer, and the HSCW zone must meet the summer ventilation requirements. The buildings are insulated in winter. The HSWW zone must meet the heat insulation requirements in summer. In temperate zones, some areas may need to consider insulation in winter but generally do not consider heat protection in summer. The simulated meteorological data in this study cover five climate zones in China. We selected 22 cities in these zones. As shown in Fig. 4 , Cities 1\u20135 are Harbin, Urumqi, Changchun, Shenyang, and Hohhot in the SC zone. Cities 6\u201310 are Beijing, Taiyuan, Jinan, Zhengzhou, and Xi 'an in cold zones. Cities 11\u201315 are Nanjing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Chongqing, and Changsha in the HSCW zone. Cities 16\u201320 are five cities located in the HSWW zone: Fuzhou, Guangzhou, Nanning, Hong Kong, and Haikou. City 21 and City 22 are Guiyang and Kunming, located in temperate zones. A brief analysis of the weather conditions in different cities is carried out. Since radiant floor cooling systems are prone to floor condensation, a statistical analysis of the dry bulb temperature (DBT) and wet bulb temperature (WBT) of the outdoor air from June to August is conducted. Table 3 lists the monthly average DBT and WBT in 22 cities from June to August. The DBT of the outdoor air is lower in the SC zone; the summer is short, and the weather is cool. The DBT of City 2 is higher, and the WBT is the lowest because the air is hot and dry in this region. Although the DBT of the cities in the temperate zones is lower than that of the SC zone, the WBT is higher because the summer is warm and humid. The DBTs of the other three climate zones are not substantially different, but the WBT is the highest in the HSWW zone. The cities in this zone are located on the southern coast, with heavy rainfall in summer and the highest humidity. The cooling load of a building is affected by outdoor climate conditions and the building envelope. Fig. 5 shows the latent cooling load and sensible cooling load and their proportions in 22 cities in different climate zones. The cooling load is the largest in the HSCW zone, and the average cooling load of the buildings in this climate zone is 114 W/m2. City 13 has the largest building cooling load, and the latent cooling load accounts for 52 %. It is the representative city of the HSCW zone, with high temperatures and humidity. The average building load in the cold zone is 107 W/m2, ranking in second place. City 9 has the largest proportion of the latent cooling load in the cold zone. The average cooling load of cities in the HSWW zone is 100 W/m2, and city 16 has the largest latent cooling load. The average cooling load is 71 W/m2 in the temperate zone and 80 W/m2 in the SC zone. City 2 has the smallest cooling load, and its latent cooling load only accounts for 9 % of the total load. 2.3 Strategy design Fig. 6 shows the schematic diagram of a radiant floor cooling system. The radiant part of the floor transfers cold energy into the room through heat transfer and radiation and removes the sensible heat in the room. A ventilation system brings fresh air into the room, changing the temperature and humidity and reducing the latent heat load in the room. To prevent air condensation on radiant surfaces, we ensure that the temperature difference between the radiant surface temperature and dew point temperature to be greater than or equal to 2 °C at all times. The cooling coil unit is used to eliminate the moisture from the outdoor air when there is any condensation risk. Moreover, if the setting room air temperature (26 °C) cannot be maintained by radiant floor cooling system due to the large cooling load, the cooling coil in the ventilation system will provide supplemental cooling. The radiant tubing is easily blocked by impurities in the water due to its small diameter. A heat exchanger is used to obtain the desired cooling capacity and ensure the sanitation of the circulating water in the radiant tubing. Here, it is assumed that the heat exchange efficiency of the heat exchanger is 1. The control module outputs the control signals for the ventilation and radiant floor systems according to the indoor parameter values. The Indoor air quality standard (GB/T 18883-2022) [34] recommends indoor temperatures of 22\u201328 °C and relative humidity (RH) of 40 %\u201380 % in public buildings. Here, the indoor temperature is set to 26 °C. Since the supplied air only provides fresh air for occupants (1\u20132 h−1 [35]), the ventilation flow rate in the control strategies is set at 1\u20131.5 h−1. Four strategies for controlling the radiant floor cooling system are evaluated: Strategy 1 [36], Strategy 2 [37], Strategy 3, and Strategy 4 [23]. The control strategy parameters are listed in Table 4 , and the four strategies are briefly described below. Strategy 1 [36] is a variable water supply temperature control (Fig. 7 (a)). The control parameters of this strategy are the water supply temperature and the air supply temperature. The water supply temperature depends on the outdoor air temperature. It is in the range of 16\u201321 °C [38] to remain in the comfortable range. The ventilation temperature is switched between 16 and 18 °C. When the indoor air temperature is less than 26.5 °C, the supply air temperature is 18 °C. Otherwise, the supply air temperature is reduced to 16 °C, and the auxiliary radiant floor system provides cooling. The temperature of the floor surface is monitored, and the difference between the floor surface temperature and the indoor dew point temperature is calculated to prevent condensation on the floor surface. When the value is less than 2 °C, the ventilation system is engaged to dehumidify the indoor air. Strategy 2 [37] is a three-step control that depends on the room temperature (Fig. 7(b)). The control parameters are the water supply and the air supply flow. When the indoor air temperature exceeds the set value, the radiant floor system is turned on; otherwise, it remains off. The system water supply temperature is maintained at 17 °C. The air supply temperature of the ventilation system is 19 °C, and the ventilation volume is in the range of 1\u20131.5 h−1. If the indoor air temperature exceeds 26.2 °C, the ventilation volume is increased to 1.5 h−1 to assist with cooling and dehumidifying the indoor air. Otherwise, the minimum air supply volume is used. Strategy 3 is a precooling strategy that controls the water supply temperature and supply airflow (Fig. 7(c)). This strategy responds to indoor air changes by maintaining the temperature of the water supply at 17 °C to 19 °C. The ventilation system is used for indoor dehumidification and auxiliary cooling. The supply air temperature of the ventilation system is 20 °C, and the ventilation volume is the same as Strategy 2. The radiant floor system is switched on two hours in advance to precool the building. Strategy 4 [23] uses a natural cold source and adjusts the indoor temperature by controlling the supply airflow, i.e., it is a direct ground cooling strategy (Fig. 7(d)). The radiant floor system is provided with high-temperature cold water by the direct ground cooling source, and the ventilation system uses a geothermal heat pump as the cold source to provide 7 °C water. The air supply maintains indoor air quality. The supply air temperature of the ventilation system is 21 °C, and the ventilation volume is the same as Strategy 2. The radiant floor system operates all day in this strategy. 2.4 TRNSYS model TRNSYS [39] is used to establish the temperature- and humidity-independent control model of the radiant floor cooling system. TRNSYS uses a modular approach and controls the operation of the system by selecting and connecting the modules to obtain accurate system operation data. The radiant floor cooling system is established by customizing the building modules to simulate the indoor thermal comfort and energy consumption of different radiant floor cooling system strategies. The simulation system diagrams of the four strategies are shown in Fig. 8 . The information exchange between TRNSYS and MATLAB is based on Type155. TRNSYS transmits the indoor state parameters to MATLAB for evaluation. MATLAB assesses the indoor temperature and humidity to output control signals. For example, when the indoor temperature exceeds the set value, MATLAB transmits a signal to reduce the water supply temperature to Type 155. The control signals of the supply air temperature, supply air humidity, water supply temperature, and other parameters are communicated from MATLAB to TRNSYS. The weather module that uses the outdoor dynamic parameters is Type 15-3. It uses the Type 56 building module to establish the office building model. The detailed parameters of the building are described in Section 2.2. The cold source of the system is a ground source heat pump modeled by Type 927 in the software. The temperature of the cold source water is 7 °C. Since the ventilation system and the radiant floor system use the same cold source, Type 116 is required to control the water supply temperature of the radiant floor system and prevent low radiant surface temperatures. The ventilation system consists of Type 754 and Type 508 modules to control the supply air temperature and humidity. After the model is established, the four strategies are run under different climate conditions, and the operation data are derived for the subsequent analysis. The simulation time step size is 15 min. 2.5 System assessment 2.5.1 Thermal comfort evaluation The thermal comfort is assessed based on the indoor air temperature, indoor operative temperature (T op), and predicted mean vote (PMV). According to the ASHARE 55-2017 standard [40], the occupant metabolic rate was set to 1.2 met, and the occupant clothing was set to 0.5 clo. Since the indoor reference air temperature is 26 °C, the standard deviation is used to compare the stability of the indoor air temperature as follows [41]: (1) SD = 1 n ∑ i = 1 j ( t i n , i - t ¯ ) 2 where SD is the sample standard deviation of the room temperature, °C; t in,i is the room temperature in the i th hour after the start of the calculation; t ¯ is the average room air temperature. The operative temperature (T op) is the uniform temperature of an imaginary black enclosure filled with air. It is calculated using Eq. (2) [40]. When the thermal comfort of the building is satisfactory, the T op should be in the range of 23\u201326 °C [42]. The PMV predicts the mean value of votes by occupants on a 7-point thermal sensation scale. The thermal comfort range is −0.5 < PMV <0.5 [40]. (2) T o p = 1 2 T i n - 1 2 T r where T op is the operative temperature; T in is the indoor air temperature; T r is the radiant temperature. The number of hours exceeding the range of the PMV is calculated using Eq. (3) [40] to evaluate the thermal comfort of the building: (3) EH p = ∑ H d i s c where EH p is the exceedance hours of the PMV comfort zone; H disc is a discomfort hour (H disc = 1 if |PMV| − 0.5 > 0 and 0 otherwise). 2.5.2 Condensation risk assessment If the radiant surface temperature is lower than the indoor air dew point temperature, floor condensation occurs, reducing the cooling capacity of the system. Long-term condensation also affects indoor sanitary conditions and can cause a health hazard. Thus, the condensation risk must be evaluated. In general, when the T s-T dew ≥ 2 °C, there is no condensation risk [43]. The number of hours when T s-T dew < 2 °C is quantified to compare the condensation risk of different strategies. Since the radiant floor system in Strategy 4 operates all day, the non-working hours are included. 2.5.3 Energy consumption evaluation The energy consumption of the radiant floor cooling system is calculated according to the TRNSYS simulation results. We use the standard for building carbon emission calculation (GB/T51366-2019) [44] to calculate the carbon emissions of the building. The total carbon emissions per unit building are calculated according to the energy consumption of different systems based on different energy types using Eqs. (4) and (5): (4) CEs = [ ∑ i = 1 n E i E F i - C p ] y A (5) E i = ∑ j = 1 n ( E i , j - E R i , j ) where CEs is the carbon emissions per unit building area in the building\u2019s operating stage, kg CO2/m2; E i is the annual consumption of building energy of Class i, unit/a; EF i is the CE factor of the ith energy type; E i,j is the Class i energy consumption for Class j systems, unit/a; ER i,j is the amount of Class i energy supplied by the renewable energy system consumed by the Class j system, unit/a; i is the type of terminal energy consumed by the building, including electricity, gas, oil, and municipal heat; j is the type of building energy consumption system, including HVAC, and lighting; C p is the annual carbon reduction attributed to the carbon sink system of the building\u2019s green space, kg CO2/m2; y is the design life of the building (50 years); A is the building floor area. 2.5.4 Comprehensive comparison of strategies Multi-criteria decision-making is used to compare the strategies. The steps are as proposed as follows. (1) Establishing a decision-making hierarchy, (2) Sorting data and pairwise comparison, (3) Calculating the weights of the strategies, (4) Aggregate the weights and sort the strategies to select the optimum one. Fig. 9 shows the decision-making hierarchy for choosing the optimum radiant floor system strategy. The top layer shows the optimum radiant floor cooling system solution. The middle layer depicts the criteria [26], including thermal comfort (TC), condensation risk (CR), energy consumption (EC), and carbon emissions (CEs). The bottom layer shows the four strategies. For the index weights of the optimum radiant floor cooling system, a short literature review was conducted and presented as shown in Fig. 10 . In this figure, different weights distribution of the best air condition system of eight scenarios are shown. It can be found from this figure that Scenario B [45] and Scenario G [25] focus on the impact of indoor thermal comfort, Scenario D [46] and Scenario E [46] focus on the impact of indoor thermal comfort and indoor air quality, Scenario A [26], Scenario C [46] and Scenario F [25] concentrate on the impact of energy consumption, and Scenario H [25] considers equal subjective weight. In addition to thermal comfort, energy consumption and carbon emissions, other factors, such as economical cost, are also considered in different cases (Fig. 10). Therefore, taking into account the importance of carbon emissions and condensation risk, this study selected three different scenarios with different index weights for above criterion. As shown in Table 5 , Scenario 1 assumes that all attributes have the same weight. Scenario 2 focuses on the system\u2019s impact on the environment; thus, the carbon emissions have three times the weight of the other attributes. Scenario 3 gives three times higher weight to the condensation risk. The simulation results of the different strategies in the different zones are compared, and the radiant cooling system with the highest performance index is selected. Pairwise comparison of criteria is conducted, and the results are scored using a nine-point scale, ranging from extremely minor to extremely important [46]. Then, weights of the criteria are calculated using the arithmetic mean, geometric average, and eigenvector method. We created a comparison matrix and assigned subjective and objective priority weights. Finally, we evaluate the consistency of the matrix [47]. 3 Results 3.1 Indoor environment 3.1.1 Indoor air temperature fluctuations Fig. 11 shows the daily indoor air temperature stability of the 22 cities for the four strategies. The indoor air temperature fluctuations are small in the first three strategies, and the difference between the cities is small. The SD of Strategy 1 is concentrated around 0.25 °C, and that of Strategy 2 and Strategy 3 is concentrated around 0.29 °C. The SD distribution of Strategy 4 is more scattered which is characterized by a large temperature difference for the indoor air temperature. The SD range of cities 12 to 15 and cities 17 to 19 is small, and that of cities 3 to 11 and cities 20 to 22 is large. The reason is that the cooling water is continuously operated during night with a small cooling load which leads to the downward trend of the indoor air temperature at night and reaches the lowest in the early morning. The indoor thermal comfort stability in cold, HSCW and HSWW zones is better, bigger differences between cities in SC zone. 3.1.2 Indoor thermal comfort Fig. 12 shows the indoor thermal comfort of Strategy 1 in different cities on July 12. The indoor temperature of the buildings in most cities shows a downward trend after a brief rise at 9:00 and begins to rise again at 13:00, reaching the maximum value at 17:00. City 2 is located in a dry climate with sufficient sunlight. The maximum indoor air temperature generally occurs in the morning, and the overall indoor temperature is also higher than in other cities. The indoor operating temperatures of City 2 and City 18 are high, and other cities meet the thermal comfort requirements during working hours. The indoor PMV values of the other cities are between −0.5 and 0.5, indicating good thermal comfort, except for City 2. The RH is below 65 % in all cities and is relatively low in cities in cold zone due to the dry climate in northern China. Fig. 13 shows the indoor thermal comfort of Strategy 2 in different cities on July 12. The indoor temperature of the buildings in most cities first drops, then starts to rise again at noon, and reaches the maximum at around 17:00. The indoor operating temperature is maintained at about 26 °C, and the indoor PMV values of each city meet the requirements (-0.5 to 0.5). The difference in indoor thermal comfort between cities is small. The RH of most cities is maintained at about 60 %, but that of City 2 is too low. The reason is that when the building load is large, the incoming fresh air reduces the indoor humidity. In addition, the climate of City 2 is relatively dry. Fig. 14 shows the indoor thermal comfort in different cities on July 12 for Strategy 3. Indoor thermal comfort varies considerably in different cities because the system is substantially affected by outdoor weather conditions. The indoor thermal comfort is better in the cold and HSCW zones, and the operating temperatures during working hours remain 24 °C and 26 °C. The indoor PMV value of each city meets the requirements. The RH ranges from 65 % to 75 %. Strategy 3 has a higher RH than the first two strategies because the radiant floor system bears a large load, the ventilation system has a small air supply volume, and the indoor air temperature is low. Fig. 15 shows the indoor thermal comfort of Strategy 4 in different cities on July 12. The minimum indoor air temperature occurs in the morning, and the overall trend is upward, reaching the maximum at 17:00. The indoor thermal comfort is better in the cold, HSCW, and HSWW zones. The PMV value of some cities in the SC and temperate zones is less than −0.5 in the morning, indicating low thermal comfort. Since the indoor air temperature is generally lower in Strategy 4 than in the other three strategies, the RH is relatively high (70 % to 80 %). Also, the RH is low in the afternoon in City 2 due to the climatic conditions. Due to the high outdoor air temperature and high humidity in City 13, the operating states of the four strategies differ significantly in this city. Therefore, the operation status is analyzed; the values of the indoor parameters are shown in Fig. 16 . At the beginning of August, the PMV values are the lowest for Strategy 4, followed by Strategy 3, Strategy 1, and Strategy 2. However, the thermal comfort of Strategy 4 is low in the middle of August, and the PMV values are in the range of −0.5 to 0.5 during working hours for the other three strategies. The water supply temperature of Strategy 1 is a function of the outdoor air temperature. It is generally higher than that of the other strategies in the morning; therefore, the indoor temperature is higher in the early stage. The radiant floor system of Strategy 2 uses a three-step control; thus, the temperature of the radiant floor surface is higher than that of the other strategies, and the T op is the highest. Strategy 3 turns on the radiant floor system in advance to precool the building. A period of decline occurs in the morning; therefore, the indoor thermal environment stability is higher for Strategy 3 than for the other strategies. Strategy 4 creates a cold environment in the room in the morning, and the low floor temperature reduces thermal comfort. As the indoor load changes, the higher water supply temperature can only handle a limited heat load, and the indoor temperature is too warm in the afternoon. 3.1.3 Discomfort hours The number of discomfort hours for the four strategies is listed in Table 6 . The number of discomfort hours is the least in the HSWW zone, and those of the other cities are below 60 h, except for City 16. Different results are observed in the other climate zones for different strategies. Most of the cities with a large number of discomfort hours in Strategy 1 are located in the SC zone. The outdoor air temperature is low in the SC zone, affecting the water supply temperature of the radiant floor system and reducing indoor thermal comfort. Only Strategy 2 and Strategy 3 have cities without discomfort hours. Eight cities with high discomfort hours are observed for Strategy 2, four of which are located in cold zones. However, Strategy 2 has the smallest total number of discomfort hours (169 h). Strategy 3 has the largest number of cities (14 cities) without any discomfort hours and the total number of discomfort hours is 185 h. The total number of discomfort hours in Strategy 4 is 4327 h, exceeding that of the other three strategies. The cities with the largest number of discomfort hours are located in the temperate zone; the discomfort hours account for 40.2 %\u201344.8 % of the total working hours. 3.2 Risk of moisture condensation Fig. 17 shows the difference between the floor surface temperature and the indoor air dew point temperature of the four strategies in different cities. Strategy 2 has the lowest condensation risk, followed by Strategy 1, Strategy 3, and Strategy 4. Since the ventilation system only operates during the day, the difference between the floor surface temperature and the radiation surface is small at night when the ventilation system is not in operation. Strategy 4 runs the radiant floor cooling system at night, increasing the condensation risk. The SC, cold, and temperate zones have drier climates and lower condensation risk. City 14 and City 15 have condensation risk at night in all four strategies due to the humid climate. A comparison of the four strategies indicates that the dew formation on the radiation surface is related to the city climate and the radiation surface temperature. The condensation risk can be substantially reduced by controlling the radiation surface temperature and using the ventilation system to dehumidify the air, ensuring the normal operation of the system during working hours. Table 7 presents the number of hours when the difference between the floor surface temperature and the indoor air dew point temperature is less than 2 °C for different strategies in different areas. The condensation risk is the lowest in the SC zone, followed by the temperate, HSCW, HSWW, and cold zones. The reasons are the low cooling load in cold and temperate zones, the higher water supply temperature on the floor surface, the high radiation surface temperature, and the low condensation risk. It is humid in the HSWW zone, and condensation can occur without dehumidification by the ventilation system. Strategy 2 has the lowest condensation risk. The number of hours of condensation risk is 6.5 % higher in Strategy 2, 65.7 % higher in Strategy 3, and 91.0 % higher in Strategy 4 than in Strategy 2. The hours of condensation on the radiation surface of the strategy are much lower than the condensation risk. The condensation hours of the four strategies in 22 cities accounted for less than 10 % of the simulation time. 3.3 Building energy saving and environmental effect analysis In addition to evaluating indoor thermal comfort, the energy-saving potential of the system should also be considered in the design of a building air conditioning system. Fig. 18 shows the energy consumption and carbon emissions for the four strategies in 22 cities. The energy consumption of Strategy 1 is in the range of 19.3\u201336.2 W/m2. Strategy 1 has the largest difference in energy consumption and carbon emissions between different zones. The water supply temperature of the radiant floor system in Strategy 1 is affected by the outdoor air temperature, which differs significantly for different climate zones. The energy consumption of the 22 cities is 28\u201337 W/m2, and Strategy 2 has the highest values. In this strategy, the difference between energy consumption and carbon emissions of the cities is small. The ventilation system of Strategy 2 has a larger cooling load, and the radiant floor system has a smaller cooling load, resulting in higher energy consumption. The energy consumption of Strategy 3 is lower than that of Strategy 1 and Strategy 2, and it has 21 %\u201337 % lower energy consumption than Strategy 2 (Table 8 ). Strategy 4 has the lowest carbon emissions and energy consumption because direct ground cooling is used. The energy consumption of the 22 cities is in the range of 11.0\u201317.1 W/m2. The average energy consumption and carbon emissions of the strategies are relatively low in the SC and temperate zones (Table 8) and relatively high in the HSWW zone. Strategy 4 with a natural cold source has the highest energy-saving potential in the SC and temperate zones, 42 %\u201363 % higher than that of the other strategies. 3.4 System application potential analysis Pairwise comparison of the strategies\u2019 criteria is conducted. The arithmetic mean, geometric average, and eigenvectors were averaged and used as the weights of the strategies (Table 9 ). The consistency ratio ranges from 0 to 0.1 [26]. The ranking of the four strategies with the three different scenarios is listed in Table 10 . In Scenario 1, the indoor thermal comfort conditions and energy-saving demand are considered to be equally important, and the weight coefficients of the four indicators are assumed to be the same. Strategy 4 with the natural cooling source is the optimal approach in all 22 cities due to its high energy savings. Strategy 1 has the lowest rank due to climatic influences in cities 6\u20138 in the SC and cold zones and in cities 11\u201312 in the HSCW zone. The remaining cities have the lowest rank in Strategy 2. The main reason is that the weights are the same. The energy consumption and the water supply temperature in Strategy 1 are affected by the outdoor air temperature; Strategy 1 does not apply to SC zone. Scenario 2 focuses on environmental protection. Strategy 4 with direct ground cooling has the highest score, indicating the advantages of the natural cold source. Although Strategy 2 and Strategy 3 have lower scores, Strategy 2 performs worst in 12 cities in Scenario 1 and 15 cities in Scenario 2. The weight of carbon emissions is three times that of the thermal comfort. In Scenario 3, the condensation risk is high. In this scenario, the ranking of the strategies has changed. Strategy 1 has the highest score in eight cities (City 10, Cities 13\u201317, City 19, and City 22). Strategy 2 has the highest score in City 12. Strategy 3 has the two highest scores in Cities 3 and 21. Of the remaining 10 cities, Strategy 4 has the highest score. The higher weight of the indoor thermal comfort, the higher the condensation risk is in Strategy 4 in cities in hot and humid climate. 4 Discussion We investigated four conventional control strategies for radiant floor cooling systems, including variable water supply temperature control, three-step control, precooling control, and direct ground cooling source. TRNSYS was used to model the radiant floor cooling systems and their operation characteristics in 22 cities in five climatic zones in China. Four criteria were analyzed: thermal comfort, condensation risk, energy consumption, and carbon emissions. The results provide a theoretical reference for radiant floor cooling systems in China. 4.1 Analysis of thermal comfort and energy consumption parameter The ventilation rate is constrained by indoor thermal comfort and energy consumption [27], and the impact of the outdoor conditions is minimized. However, the energy savings are low. The direct ground cold source results in a higher energy-saving potential of the system [48]. The precooling strategy reduces the peak load of the building and the system\u2019s operating costs when the peak-valley electricity price difference is high [49,50]. An economic analysis of the system would be required to determine the outcome. Although lots of simulation work has been done by us, it only focuses on the energy consumption and carbon emissions of the radiant floor cooling system. Many studies [51,52] have found that the initial cost of radiant cooling system meaningful to analyze the initial cost and the life cycle cost of different control strategies, which will help to judge their application prospects in the market. Radiant floor cooling systems can maintain better thermal comfort environment compared with the traditional air conditioning systems [53,54]. However, it was observed from Figs. 12-15 that at many simulation steps, the room air temperature may be far from the air temperature and relative humidity setting ranges, namely, 24\u201326 °C and 40\u201360 %, respectively [40]. It may due to the influence of radiation heat transfer of the system, the composite system can provide more acceptable thermal environment even if the indoor air temperature exceeds 26 °C [37,55,56]. Besides, the building envelope with a larger thermal mass can have a certain thermal inertia, which will aggravate the slower response of the radiant cooling system and lead to the air temperature beyond the set point. High relative humidity increases the condensation risk of the system, which is always a critical issue for the application aspect of radiant cooling system. We prevent condensation by controlling the radiant surface temperature and the air relative humidity. This is also a commonly used method of practical application [57]. However, the condensation still occurred in some cities in this study, especially in those located in hot and humid climate zones. This is due to the outdoor meteorological conditions and the setting of control points. The radiant floor cooling system only relies on the ventilation system for dehumidification, thereby, a hot and humid environment increases the indoor humidity load. However, the humidity control strategies mainly consider the condensation risk of the radiant surface. This will cause the relative humidity to exceed the reasonable range without dehumidification. Although the human body can adapt to the relative humidity beyond the prescriptive range, it can still ensure health environment within the reasonable range [58]. Therefore, more effective dehumidification equipment [28] or more complex control algorithms could be a better solution [43]. Moreover, occupant behaviors should be taken into account regarding the condensation prevention solution [59]. 4.2 Accuracy of control strategy evaluation The design and operation of radiant cooling system is complicated [60], and there is still a large space for its development in China [61]. Climate change is one of the factors affecting the application effect of radiant cooling system. Currently, scholars have studied climate zones in India [62], the United States [63,64] and European countries [65,66]. Their comparative studies are basically conducted through the simulation method [35,66]. In addition, those studies do not take into account the influence of different climate zones on some building factors [62,65]. In this study, four commonly used control strategies in engineering application are selected to analyze the influence of climate zones on the performance of radiant floor cooling systems. These strategies are based on controlling the supply water temperature and supply water flow rate, such as Strategy 1, Strategy 2 and Strategy 4 [23,36,37]. We proposed Strategy 3, a precooling strategy, to overcome the long response time of the system by opening the radiant floor cooling system in advance. To compare the different control strategies comprehensively, the multi-criteria decision method is used to evaluate the four strategies. There are two main methods for the evaluation of air conditioning system [46,67]. We focused on the application potential of the control strategies in different climate zones. However, if the condensation risk is considered, the ranking of the strategies differs in different climate zones. For example, Strategy 4 ranks the highest in Beijing, Taiyuan, Jinan, and Zhengzhou in the cold climate zone, but Strategy 1 ranks first in Xian. The main reason is that the outdoor weather condition affects the strategies. Some studies have observed a change in the climate zones due to global warming [68]. Therefore, the weather condition plays the significant role in confirming the control strategies than the selection of climate zone. In addition, it is more important to evaluate the effectiveness of models and results than to draw conclusions that are valid only for specific situations. We modeled an office building in a cold climate zone [23], set the internal load and schedule of the building according to the national standard [32], and defined thermal parameters of the building envelope according to the planning and design of different climate zones [69]. Therefore, the study results are universally applicable, but the control strategy requires the setting of many parameters, a common drawback of traditional control strategies. 4.3 Experimental validation and further studies There are some limitations that will be addressed in future research. The four control strategies evaluated in this study involve lots of parameters setting, which is the deficiency of the traditional control strategy [70]. Many advanced control strategies with better performance can reduce parameter setting and enhance the reproducibility of the study [70,71], which have be proven successful [7], e.g. pulse-width modulation [18], model predictive control [20], and adaptive predictive control [72]. Moreover, this study established a simulation model through TRNSYS program. However, the experimental studies was not employed to validate the model [71], especially considering the different control strategies in different climate conditions. Currently, the field studies on comprehensive benchmark control strategies and climate zones remains a big challenge. Therefore, further studies should be considered on the potential application of advance control strategies and comprehensive experiments. 5 Conclusion The indoor environment and outdoor climate conditions affect the operating state of radiant floor cooling systems in office buildings. This study analyzed four conventional control strategies of radiant floor cooling systems in office buildings in five climate zones in China. We ranked the four strategies and investigated their application potential. The following results were obtained. The influence of the outdoor climate on indoor thermal comfort could be reduced by controlling the radiant floor cooling system, resulting in high thermal comfort. Strategy 2 (three-step control) had the highest thermal comfort and indoor air temperature stability. Only 5 % of the cities exceeded the thermal comfort zone. However, the condensation risk of the radiation surface differed substantially between different climate zones. The number of condensation risk hours was generally larger in the HSCW and HSWW zones than in the other three climate zones, and the cold zone had the lowest condensation risk. Strategy 4 (direct ground cooling source) had the lowest energy consumption and carbon emissions using the natural cooling source, i.e., 25 %\u201366 % lower energy consumption than the other three strategies. Subjective preference of attributes will affect the ranking of the control strategies differed for different cities. In the balanced consideration of four criteria and preferred carbon emissions, Strategy 4 has the greatest application potential in 22 cities, followed by Strategy 3 (precooling control). When the condensation risk was considered, Strategy 4 ranked the highest in Harbin, Urumqi, Shenyang, Hohhot, Beijing, Taiyuan, Jinan, Zhengzhou, Nanjing, Nanning, and Haikou in the SC and cold zones. Strategy 1 (variable water supply temperature control) ranked first in Wuhan, Chongqing, Changsha, Fuzhou, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, and Kunming in the HSCW, HSWW, and temperate zones. Strategy 3 was preferred in Changchun and Guiyang. Although the energy consumption and carbon emissions of Strategy 2 were relatively high, this strategy ranked the highest in Shanghai. In summary, a suitable control strategy for radiant floor cooling systems of office buildings depends on the parameter priority, i.e., carbon emissions, condensation risk, thermal comfort, or energy consumption. The advantages and limitations of the strategy should be considered in the early design stage.

        "dc:description": "The application potential of radiant floor cooling systems is affected by climatic conditions. The meteorological parameters of 22 cities in five climatic zones in China (severe cold (SC), cold, hot summer and cold winter (HSCW), hot summer and warm winter (HSWW), and temperate) are analyzed to evaluate the applicability of four conventional control strategies of radiant floor cooling system in office buildings. The control strategies are modeled in the Transient System Simulation Program (TRNSYS), and the indoor thermal comfort, condensation risk, energy consumption, and carbon emissions are analyzed. Multi criteria decision-making is used to evaluate the radiant floor system. The results show that the control strategy with direct ground cooling produces the highest energy savings in the five climate zones. The energy savings are 25\u201366 % higher than those of the three control strategies using a heat pump as a cold source. Under the same indoor environment conditions, the three-step control strategy provides the optimum indoor temperature and humidity control. The number of hours when the three-step control strategy exceeds the thermal comfort zone is 5 % in 22 cities, and the number of hours with condensation risk is only 3%. The variable water supply temperature control and precooling control have better performance than the other strategies in the SC, cold, and temperate zones. In addition, the control strategies are ranked based on their application potential in 22 cities. The application potential of the radiant floor cooling system with a direct ground cooling source is the highest in the five climate zones in the two scenarios with equal weights of the four criteria and is preferable due to less carbon emissions. When the condensation risk is considered, the radiant floor cooling system with a direct ground cooling source exhibits better performance in the SC and cold zones. The variable water supply temperature control is the optimum strategy in the HSCW, HSWW, and temperate zones. The precooling control strategy ranks the highest in Changchun and Guiyang, and the three-step control strategy performs the best in Shanghai.",
