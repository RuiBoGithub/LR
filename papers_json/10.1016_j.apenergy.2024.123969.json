Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology Hong Kong, China Model Predictive Control (MPC) has demonstrated its capability to significantly enhance energy efficiency while ensuring indoor comfort. This study focuses on the development and fair comparison of two Economic Model Predictive Control(EMPC) frameworks with the goal of optimizing demand response for utility cost reduction and ensuring thermal comfort in residential buildings. The first framework, known as RC-MPC, utilizes a reduced-order thermal Resistance\u2013Capacitance network model to represent the thermal dynamics of the building. It formulates the optimization problem as a Linear Programming (LP) task, which is solved using CPLEX. The second framework, known as ANN-MPC, employs an Artificial Neural Network model capture the thermal behavior of the building, It addresses a non-convex optimization problem through projected stochastic gradient descent. To evaluate the performance of these frameworks, experiments are conducted using a single-zone dwelling within the BOPTEST framework. The results demonstrate that both approaches effectively reduce operational costs and enhance comfort, achieving comparable performance and outperforming the baseline Rule-Based Control (RBC) method. The discomfort reductions range from 30% to 95%, and energy expense savings range from 17% to 34%. Furthermore, the study examines the impact of various MPC hyperparameters. The findings highlight that a proper control horizon and formulating the objective function accurately are crucial for achieving optimal control performance. Additionally, tightening the comfort range is found to be important in managing the comfort violations, and the choice of solver can influence both the control performance and computational efficiency. Keywords Model predictive control Grey-box model Artificial neural network Building energy optimization BOPTEST Data availability I am providing the URL link where the research data and code can be accessed: https://github.com/wfzheng/EMPC_Comparision. 1 Introduction Buildings account for more than one-third of the total primary energy supply [1]. In various building systems, the Heating, Ventilation and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) systems account for the largest proportion of building energy consumption and have the most significant energy saving potential [2]. Therefore, optimizing the energy efficiency of HVAC systems while ensuring thermal comfort can significantly contribute to energy saving and decarbonization. In recent years, there has been a growing popularity in adopting optimal control for HVAC systems to improve energy efficiency [3] and Model predictive control (MPC) stands out as one of the most promising techniques. MPC performs the prediction and optimization by using the mathematical model of the controlled building and taking future disturbance predictions and thermal comfort constraint, which achieves a substantial reduction of energy consumption in numerous studies [4]. Although there have been extensive research efforts, MPC has not yet been widely employed in the building management system. One of the main reasons pointed out by [5] is that developing grey-box models and the subsequent parameter identification, particularly for complex buildings with heat and mass transfers, which are time-consuming and expertise-demanding. As machine learning has been extensively adopted for modeling dynamic systems, fault detection, etc. [6] and the growing availability of sensor data collected from the building sector, data-driven modeling presents a promising solution to predict the system dynamics without domain knowledge [7]. With sufficient training data, data-driven approaches can more accurately predict building thermodynamics if the system dynamics are uncertain or unavailable [8]. 1.1 Related studies In building energy management for MPC controllers, three types of building models are commonly utilized: white-box, grey-box, and black-box models. The white-box model utilizes building construction information for parameter acquisition. However, obtaining construction information is often challenging for existing buildings, hindering the development of white-box models. To overcome this limitation, black-box and grey-box models offer viable alternatives. Grey-box models integrate physics-based models with operational data to identify parameters. Black-box models employ data-driven methods purely based on operational data, without the physical process knowledge. RC models, representative of grey-box models, are widely used in MPC controller due to their robust integration of physical principles with operation data. RC models characterize building thermal dynamics with simplified thermal resistor (R) and Capacitor (C) networks, such as the 1R1C or 2R2C models. RC substantially reduce computational overhead and therefore are especially suitable for MPC. The implementation in a real-world scenario by Wang et al. [9], who utilized a 1R1C model in a cloud-based MPC to achieve operational cost savings of 22%\u201327% in residential air conditioning. Walnum et al. [10] used a 2R2C network to model a simple building envelope emulator to evaluate an MPC controller\u2019s performance and highlighted the 12% reduction in energy use in the simulation-based study. Although the emulator and the dynamic model closely resembled idealized settings, the study demonstrated MPC controller can effectively respond to varying price signals and shift heat loads. However, simplified RC models might lack the granularity needed to capture complex interactions within more intricate building systems. In [11], the authors reported that 33% of labor is allocated towards grey-box model development and integration. Developing and calibrating precise models requires more effort and is challenging to understand the physical system in detail [12]. This limitation is magnified when trying to identify suitable structures for grey-box models, as the process can become intricate when the building behavior is complex, thus requiring a delicate balance between model simplicity and control performance [13]. Blum et al. [14] analyzed different RC network models, including 1R1C, 3R3C, and 5R4C, assessing their impact on the accuracy of simulating thermal dynamics and the performance of controllers. More complex RC network models were found to better capture the thermal dynamics of buildings. Control simulation tests have shown that the higher the accuracy of the model predictions, the better the MPC\u2019s effectiveness in optimizing building energy consumption. Data-driven black-box models offer flexibility by leveraging operational data devoid of explicit physical modeling. This attribute is particularly advantageous in environments requiring rapid model adaptation and deployment. For instance, Lee and Heo [15] utilized autoregressive models with exogenous inputs (ARX) to predict indoor temperatures, exploring the applicability of linear-form data-driven models. Simulation results demonstrated that the proposed models were effective in enhancing energy efficiency and improving thermal comfort, achieving up to 12% energy saving. Stoffel et al. [16] demonstrated that ANN, Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) can be efficiently deployed with just two days of initial data and further enhanced through continual online learning, thereby positioning black-box models as adaptable solutions for real-world applications. Remarkably, they found that while ANN provided the highest prediction accuracy among the models compared, the actual performance differences in MPC were minor. The MLR-based MPC emerged as the most computationally efficient, outperforming the more complex ANN and GPR-based systems in terms of processing time. However, the flexibility of the black-box model comes with challenges. The primary limitation lies in their dependence on extensive and representative data collection processes to ensure prediction accuracy and generalization across different operational scenarios. To mitigate this, Agouzoul et al. [17] use the digital twins to generate comprehensive training samples. The digital twins simulate a full range of control variables, providing ANNs with robust datasets that improve their extrapolation capabilities beyond the initial training data. Furthermore, the computational demands of the controller model cannot be distinguished merely based on whether the models are grey-box or data-driven. Instead, it is more pertinent to consider whether the models are linear or nonlinear. Nonlinear models require the deployment of more complex optimization algorithms, which require longer computation times compared to linear models [18]. For instance, RC models are typically linear and have lower computational demands. Simulations by Picard et al. [19] further indicate that, compared to using high-order RC models, the computational workload for MPC using reduced-order RC models is significantly lower. Data-driven models can be either linear (e.g. MLR or ARX models) or nonlinear (e.g. ANN). Nonlinear data-driven models requiring specialized hardware like FPGAs for real-time applications as seen in deployment scenarios discussed by Agouzoul et al. [17]. Novel approaches like the instantaneous linearization (IL) method proposed by Yang et al. [20] address the high computational demands associated with the nonlinearity of machine learning models. By linearizing Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) model, they achieved a staggering 70-fold increase in computational speed and realized up to 31.6% in energy savings during field tests. The method not only enhances computational efficiency but also adapts to existing low-power building control hardware like Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC) and Direct Digital Controllers (DDC), showcasing the potential for widespread application without extensive hardware modifications. 1.2 Objectives While several studies have developed grey-box-based or data-driven MPC for HVAC control, there is a lack of direct comparison of these two strategies for the same optimal control problem in terms of control performance, deployment complexity, and computational time on the same platform. Our research addresses this gap by implementing and evaluating both grey-box-based MPC and data-driven MPC frameworks with the Building Optimization Testing (BOPTEST) framework [21], an open platform that provides high fidelity building emulators. The comparative analysis not only highlights the distinct advantages and challenges associated with each control framework but also explores critical aspects often overlooked in existing studies, such as the impact of MPC hyperparameters and the computational implications of different solver choices on real-time performance. Additionally, by providing deeper insights into the efficiency of various solvers, our study equips the controller developer with the knowledge to select the most appropriate solver based on specific performance criteria and computational constraints. To facilitate further research, we have also made our implementation code available open source, accessible at: https://github.com/wfzheng/EMPC_Comparision. In this study, we first developed a grey-box model and a machine-learning model to identify the thermal behavior of the building. Subsequently, we designed and implemented the Resistance\u2013Capacitance (RC) network based MPC (RC-MPC) and Artificial Neural Networks based MPC (ANN-MPC) controllers to optimize building energy management considering the thermal comfort and operational cost. To fairly evaluate these two approaches, we deployed these two controllers on a high fidelity building emulator, which models a space heating system of a single zone dwelling from BOPTEST. The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the virtual testbed, RC-MPC and ANN-MPC implementation details, and evaluation metrics. Section 3 discusses and compares the results of different controllers. Section 4 presents the comprehensive ablation experiments on RC-MPC considering different control horizons, objective function formulations, solvers and comfort range tightening value, 1 1 The amount of comfort constraints tightening in the Deterministic MPC optimization. and Section 5 is the conclusion. 2 Methodology 2.1 Overview The schematic in Fig. 1 illustrates a workflow used in this study. The process begins with generating offline data from a test building to construct and train an initial building model, as outlined in Section 2.3, with the specifics of the test building detailed in Section 2.2. During the building modeling phase in Section 2.4, the workflow diverges into two different paths: one utilizes a RC model and the other an ANN model to simulate the thermal dynamics of the building. The RC model employs ordinary differential equations representing heat transfer through the building\u2019s envelope. In contrast, the ANN model utilizes a data-driven approach, predicting the building\u2019s thermal behavior based on historical data without explicit physical equations. The core module is the MPC controller, detailed in Section 2.5, utilizing distinct optimization solvers aligned with the two models. The RC model employs traditional optimization solvers, while the ANN model utilizes the Projected Stochastic Gradient Descent (PSGD) method [22], both integrating a predictor, constraints and an objective function to form the foundation of the two MPC controllers. The controller conducts real-time control of the test building\u2019s operations, and their performance is assessed and compared in Section 3, utilizing Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) as described in Section 2.6. Additionally, we conduct an ablation study on the RC-MPC controller in Section 4 to evaluate the impact of four critical hyperparameters: control horizon, objective formulation, solver selection and comfort range tightening. Each of these elements could significantly contributes to the performance of the MPC controller and therefore their evaluation is essential. 2.2 Building envelope We use an open-source testing environment called Building Optimization Testing (BOPTEST) framework [21] to implement our MPC controllers. BOPTEST offers different high-fidelity building emulators with boundary conditions (weather, occupancy, and electricity) and predefined baseline controllers. A set of key performance indicators (KPI) are specified in the emulator, including thermal discomfort, energy use, operational cost, emission, indoor air quality discomfort and computational time ratio for fair performance comparison. The BESTEST Hydronic Heat Pump is selected in our case study. Table 1 summarizes the key specifications of the building. The building is a single-room residential dwelling located in Brussels, Belgium, with a 12 × 16 m 2 floor area, a 2.7 m high ceiling and several south-oriented windows of 24 m 2 for five family members. Occupancy patterns are set to reflect real-life scenarios, with five occupants, differentiating between weekdays and weekends. The heating system consists of a 15 kW air-to-water heat pump coupled with a floor heating mechanism to maintain comfort ranges between 21\u201324 °C when occupied and 15\u201330 °C during unoccupied periods. Fig. 2 illustrates a schematic drawing of the heating system. The system consists of several main components: a heat pump, a fan, and a pump that circulates water through the system. The fan absorbs the air through the heat pump and the pump circulates water through pipes laid under the building floor to maintain indoor thermal comfort. Our study\u2019s control variable is the modulation signal of the compressor frequency, denoted by u . 2.3 Data collection In preparation for constructing the building model, it is essential to generate data for subsequent system identification. This involves utilizing a Proportional\u2013Integrative (PI) logic controller to operate the emulator for two months. (1) u t + 1 = K P × T set − T i t + K I × ∑ k = 0 t T set − T i k where the K P and K I are the proportional gain and integral gain; T i t and is the actual indoor temperature at timestep t ; T set is the indoor temperature setpoint, which varies every hour, u t + 1 represents the modulation signal of the compressor for the next time step t + 1 . To prevent data leakage and ensure the integrity of the controller testing, the periods during which data is generated are distinct from the testing periods. The collected data is then split into 80% for training and 20% for validation to alleviate overfitting during model training. Additionally, we employ the early stopping technique during ANN model training to further mitigate overfitting. To enhance the generalization and extrapolation capabilities commonly challenged in machine learning models [23], we also operate the control variables at limit values to generate the training data of extreme scenarios for ANN model, such as cases where the indoor temperature exceeds 40 ∘ C or drops below 20 ∘ C , as shown in Fig. 3. This approach ensures that the model can handle a wide range of temperature variations and maintain accuracy under extreme conditions. 2.4 Modeling of the building envelope The model incorporated in the MPC framework consists of two main components. The first component is the building thermal dynamics to predict the indoor temperature; the second is the heat pump model, which represents the heating output and power consumption of the heat pump. 2.4.1 RC model A reduced-order building model derived from the thermal RC architecture is developed to simulate the thermal dynamics of the building. This study adopted the 3R2C model because it is an appropriate trade-off between model complexity and accuracy [24], as shown in Fig. 4. It has an additional temperature node from the building wall, which allows for a more precise analysis of thermal transfer between interior and exterior regions of the building [25]. Table 2 displays the physical interpretation of the parameters for the process model. The Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) of this 3R2C model is given by: (2a) C e d T e d t = T a − T e R e a + T 0 − T 0 e R i e + A e I s o l (2b) C i d T i d t = T a − T i R w i n + T e − T i R i e + Q ̇ h + K Q ̇ i n t + A i I s o l The corresponding state-space equations can be expressed as follows: (3a) d d t T e T i = − 1 C e 1 R ea + 1 R ie C e 1 C e R ie 1 C i R ie − 1 C i 1 R w i n + 1 R ie T e T i + 1 C e R e a A e C e 0 0 1 C i R w i n A i C i 1 C i K C i T a I sol Q ̇ h Q ̇ int (3b) y = 0 1 T e T i The forward Euler method [26] is applied to discretize the continuous state-space model in Eq. (3) with a discretization time interval of 1 h as follows: (4a) x ( k + 1 ) = A d x ( k ) + B d u ( k ) (4b) y ( k ) = C d x ( k ) + D d u ( k ) where A d , B d , C d , D d are the matrices of the discrete-time state-space model that depend on the sampling time. Details of the discretization are described in the Appendix. Eq. (5) outlines the process of calibrating the parameters of the RC model. (5a) min θ ∈ R n J = ∑ k = 0 n \u2016 y ( k ) − y ˜ ( k ) \u2016 2 (5b) s.t. x ( k + 1 ) = A d x ( k ) + B d u ( k ) (5c) y ˜ ( k ) = C d x ( k ) + D d u ( k ) (5d) x ( 0 ) = x 0 (5e) θ i l ⩽ θ i ⩽ θ i u ∀ i ∈ { 1 , \u2026 , n } where y ( k ) and y ˜ ( k ) represent the measured and predicted room air temperatures, respectively; parameter vector θ = R w i n R e a R i e C i C e A i A e K T ; the initial state x 0 is the state at the starting time; x 0 = T e0 T i0 T . It is worth noting that the wall temperature is not observable. Hence, we initialize it as T e 0 = R i e T i 0 + R e a T a 0 R i e + R e a . A detailed explanation for this choice of initial wall temperature is provided in the Appendix. The constraints in Eq. (5b) are not affine transformations due to the multiplication of lumped capacitances and resistances, leading to a non-convex optimization problem. Therefore, the parameters θ are calibrated using the nonlinear least squares method via the optimize.curve_fit module within the SciPy library [27]. 2.4.2 ANN model In the case of the ANN model, the next-step indoor temperature is predicted using a multilayer perceptron (MLP) with two hidden layers, as shown in Fig. 5. The current indoor temperature can be an appropriate variable for predicting the temperature at the next time point because the indoor temperature would not deviate significantly in a short period due to the building thermal mass. Furthermore, the indoor temperature is greatly impacted by other factors, such as ambient weather conditions, internal heat gains, and thermal load from the heating system. Thus, the indoor temperature of the zone can be concisely expressed as a function of its previous value and external disturbances, as detailed in Eq. (6). (6) T i k + 1 = f T i k , T a k , I s o l k , Q ̇ h k , Q ̇ i n t k 2.4.3 Modeling of heat pump Linear regression models are developed to fit the heat pump electrical power, P h , and thermal power Q ̇ h of the floor heating system released to the zone based on the two-week data, as shown in Eqs. (7) and (8). Fig. 6 validates the performance of the regression models by comparing predicted values with simulated data. For electrical power, the model exhibits a prediction error within 15%, while for the floor heating system\u2019s thermal power, they capture over 93% of the data variability. The coefficients of determination are high at 0.98 for electrical power and 0.93 for thermal power which confirm the models\u2019 accuracy. (7) P h = 1290 ⋅ u + 1115 (8) Q ̇ h = 7221 ⋅ u + 2220 2.5 EMPC mathematical formulation Model predictive control (MPC) is an optimization framework, also known as receding horizon control. Within a limited time horizon, MPC uses the dynamic model of the controlled system to predict the trajectory of the system state and incorporate future disturbance forecasts to generate an optimal action sequence that minimizes a specific objective function under the constraints. MPC can mitigate the impact of uncertainties, including both the model uncertainties and forecast uncertainties, on controller\u2019s performance by utilizing the timely feedback from the receding horizon. However, it has also been observed that MPC shows noticeable improvement when uncertainties are considered in the design of the controller [28]. A common approach is to artificially tighten the upper and lower bounds, namely, to keep the room temperature far from the thermal comfort bound, providing a buffer zone that effectively handles small variances, though at the expense of a larger energy cost [29]. Therefore, by tightening the comfort bound with ϵ as a tuning variable, the optimization problem can be formulated as follows: (9a) min u ∈ R m ∑ k = n n + m p e k ⋅ P h k 1000 + ω ⋅ δ k (9b) s.t. T ˜ i n − 1 = T i n − 1 (9c) T ˜ i k + 1 = f T ˜ i k , T a k , I s o l k , Q ̇ h k , Q ̇ i n t k , k = n − 1 , \u2026 , n + m − 1 (9d) P h k = 1290 ⋅ u k + 1115 , k = n , \u2026 , n + m (9e) Q ̇ h k = 7221 ⋅ u k + 2220 , k = n , \u2026 , n + m (9f) ( T l k + ϵ ) − δ k ≤ T ˜ i k ≤ ( T u k − ϵ ) + δ k , k = n , \u2026 , n + m (9g) δ k ≥ 0 , k = n , \u2026 , n + m (9h) 0 ≤ u k ≤ 1 , k = n , \u2026 , n + m (9i) ϵ = 0 . 5 The economic objective function is to minimize the combined cost of operational cost and weighted temperature comfort deviation over a prediction horizon from time step n to n + m . The first term is a product of the energy consumption and the Time-of-Use (ToU) electricity pricing p e k (\u20ac / m 2 ), corresponding to Belgium\u2019s wholesale electricity market rates in 2019. The second term, ω ⋅ δ k , refers to the weighted deviation from thermal comfort. The descriptions for each equality and inequality constraint are as follows: \u2022 Eq. (9b) specifies that the initial indoor temperature. \u2022 Eq. (9c) characterizes the indoor temperature evolution based on the RC or ANN model. \u2022 Eqs. (9d) and (9e) are the constraints for the heat pump\u2019s power and floor heating thermal power. \u2022 Eq. (9f) outlines the temperature regulation bounds, setting the adjusted comfort range T l k + ϵ , T u k − ϵ , incorporating ϵ to accommodate the predictive uncertainties of the building model. The auxiliary variable δ k is introduced to ensure a non-empty feasible set for the optimization problem, allowing for flexibility in temperature regulation [30]. \u2022 Eq. (9g) ensures that δ k is non-negative. \u2022 Eq. (9h) restricts the heat pump modulation signal u k within the range of 0 to 1. \u2022 Eq. (9i) ϵ = 0 . 5 is chosen as a preliminary setting based on the maximum prediction error of around 0.5 for indoor temperature during the 0\u201312 h prediction horizons. For the RC-MPC controller, the process model f is explicitly defined by Eq. (4), whereas for the ANN-MPC controller, the process model is represented by a trained neural network. It is evident that the optimization problem formulated by RC-MPC is a Linear Programming (LP) problem, while ANN-MPC poses a non-convex optimization problem due to the non-convex nature of neural networks. To address these differences, we employ different optimization solvers for each controller. For RC-MPC, we utilize the standard commercial solvers CPLEX [31], which is well-suited for LP tasks developed by IBM company. For ANN-MPC, we employ the Projected Stochastic Gradient Descent (PSGD) algorithm, a variant of SGD optimizer. The integration of Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) ensures constraint satisfaction for control inputs. After each gradient update, we project the control vector u k onto the feasible region Q using the following projection operation: (10) u k p = argmin u ∈ Q 1 2 \u2016 u − u k \u2016 2 2 The projection operation minimizes the Euclidean distance between the projected control vector u k p and the updated control vector u k + 1 , ensuring that the resulting control inputs adhere to the specified constraints. 2.6 Evaluation metrics An embedded Proportional\u2013Integral (PI) controller is utilized as a benchmark to evaluate and compare other control algorithms. The PI controller takes the zone indoor temperature T i as input and produces the heat pump modulation signal u as output, as illustrated in Fig. 7. Its objective is to regulate the indoor temperature towards its setpoint. The overall performance of each controller is evaluated based on the three KPIs: operational costs K cost , thermal discomfort K tdis and computational time K time . The definition of each KPI is described in the appendix. Moreover, as different cost weights can be applied to various objectives to prioritize certain closed-loop behaviors over others, as suggested by [32], our optimization problem, which is characterized as multi-objective in Eq. (9a), employs a Pareto frontier. This is plotted by varying the weight parameter w , allowing for a comprehensive comparison gbetween RC-MPC and ANN-MPC controllers, instead of single-point comparisons. 3 RC-MPC versus ANN-MPC 3.1 Prediction results The first step is to compare the prediction accuracy of the process model based on the testing dataset. Fig. 8 presents sample forecasts for one week in the testing dataset for one-step-ahead predictions and summarizes key metrics, including Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and Coefficient of Variation of the Root Mean Square Error (CV-RMSE). The indoor temperature trajectories predicted by both models align well with the measured trajectories. Overall, both types of one-step-ahead prediction models exhibit high accuracy due to the slow dynamic processes of the building. The ANN model slightly outperforms the 3R2C in all metrics, indicating its competent capability to model complex nonlinear systems. However, for MPC application, it requires long-term or multi-step ahead predictions. Fig. 9 illustrates the recursive prediction method for generating muti-steps ahead forecasts. Fig. 10 displays forecasts for multi-step-ahead predictions generated by the two process models. As expected, due to compounding error, the accuracy deteriorates over the prediction horizon for the ANN model. However, for the 3R2C model, the mean absolute error decreases after the 12-hour prediction horizon, indicating that the physical RC model may capture the patterns of indoor temperature changes over longer prediction horizons. The maximum mean absolute error over the prediction horizon for the 3R2C and ANN models are 0.65 and 0.44, respectively. Additionally, the ANN model demonstrates a minor mean absolute error and uncertainty within the 24-hour prediction horizon compared to the 3R2C model. 3.2 Control performance Real-time control experiments were conducted using three different controllers: a PI baseline controller, a RC-MPC controller, and an ANN-MPC controller. Both the RC-MPC and ANN-MPC controllers are implemented with a control horizon of 12 h and a control step interval of one hour. In the BESTEST Hydronic Heat Pump case, electricity prices contain three scenarios: constant, dynamic, and highly dynamic. Electricity prices for the highly dynamic scenario are determined based on the Belgium day-ahead energy prices from the 2019 BELPEX wholesale electricity market [33]. In this study, the profile of highly dynamic electricity prices is considered. Since BOPTEST only implements deterministic forecasting, all controllers are assumed to have perfect deterministic forecasts for the disturbances. The controllers were tested during heating peak periods (January 17th to 31st) and typical heating periods (April 19th to May 3rd). Fig. 11 presents the Pareto frontier illustrating the objective trade-offs of RC-MPC and ANN-MPC across different weights during peak and typical heating periods. Overall, RC-MPC and ANN-MPC exhibit similar performance and both significantly outperform the baseline PI controller in terms of operating cost and comfort during the peak and typical heating periods. RC-MPC demonstrates superior thermal comfort with operational costs that are comparable to those of ANN-MPC, as depicted in Fig. 11(a1) and (a2). Conversely, Fig. 11(b1) and (b2) reveal that during the typical heating period, ANN-MPC tends to outperform in terms of operational costs and also maintains a lower level of thermal discomfort compared to RC-MPC. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 11, we observe that RC-MPC displays multiple overlapping points across different weights, indicating consistent performances despite changes in weight parameters. The clustering suggests that RC-MPC is less sensitive to variations in weight parameters within a certain range, highlighting its stability compared to ANN-MPC. Fig. 12 illustrates the evolution of indoor temperature, accumulated thermal discomfort, accumulated operational costs, and system disturbances during the peak and typical heating periods. For the majority of the time, indoor temperatures are controlled within the comfort range. The Baseline PI controller maintains the indoor temperature at the lower limit of the comfort range, indicating that it is well-tuned. However, the PI control based on the lower limit setpoint tracking strategy tends to result in a high possibility of comfort violations. In contrast, for the RC-MPC and ANN-MPC, we have tightened the constraints on the comfort range, allowing for a buffer zone. The two controllers approach a slightly higher temperature lower limit, reducing the comfort violations. Both the RC-MPC and ANN-MPC strategies not only maintain close to the comfort range but also dynamically adjust to changes in the Time-of-Use (ToU) pricing, effectively shifting heating loads to periods with lower energy costs. With a weight setting of 2.2, the results demonstrate that the RC-MPC controller significantly outperforms the baseline controller. Fig. 13 shows the comparison of KPIs for each controller in two testing scenarios. During the peak and typical heating periods, it achieved a reduction in overall thermal discomfort by 95% and 30% respectively, while saving 18% and 30% in total energy costs. Similarly, the ANN-MPC controller surpassed the baseline in performance across both the peak and typical heating periods. It reduced total thermal discomfort by 88% and 49%, respectively, and achieved energy savings of 17% and 34%. For the computational complexity, the results show that the ANN-MPC controller has the highest computational time, followed by the RC-MPC and baseline controllers. The observed computational time gap between the ANN-MPC and RC-MPC controllers primarily stems from differences in their optimization solvers. Specifically, the ANN-MPC utilizes the projected stochastic gradient descent, an iterative optimization method, which tends to be slower. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 12, the ANN-MPC maintains a relatively higher indoor temperature throughout the testing period compared to the RC-MPC, yet the operational costs are similar during the peak heating period and even lower during the typical heating period, indicating that ANN-MPC more effectively leverages dynamic electricity pricing to achieve lower operational costs. Despite these advancements, some thermal discomfort is unavoidable; for example, on May 1st during the typical heating period, high outdoor temperatures and solar radiation led to comfort violations within occupied hours. 4 Ablation study of the RC-MPC controller The performance of Model Predictive Control (MPC) is significantly influenced by the hyperparameters that govern its configuration. To evaluate the effect of these hyperparameters on the performance of RC-MPC, ablation studies are conducted in this section. Table 3 summarizes several significant hyperparameters in the context of building temperature control. When investigating certain hyperparameters, such as the control horizon and the comfort range tightening value, the weight parameter w in the objective function is set to 2.2 as an illustrative example. Different w may yield different optimal hyperparameters. From Section 3.2, it is recognized that the weight represents a trade-off between operational costs and thermal comfort; higher values emphasize thermal comfort over operational costs. While residents\u2019 preferences for thermal comfort may vary, it should be determined based on individual preferences, which could be assessed through surveys before designing the controller. However, exploring how to select the weight exceeds the scope of this ablation study, which aims to investigate the impact of several key hyperparameters on the performance of MPC. 4.1 Control horizon The control horizon determines how far into the future the MPC can \u201csee\u201d at each time step to make decisions [36]. Fig. 14 shows the impact of the control horizon on the MPC performance and computational time, with the \u2018Peak + Typical (averaged)\u2019 green line representing the averaged results from the peak and typical heating periods. Theoretically, increasing the control horizon has the potential to enhance the performance of MPC by enabling longer-term planning. However, this improvement comes at the expense of higher computational requirements. It is observed that there is a diminishing rate of return as the control horizon is extended. After approximately 12 h, the total cost converges to a fixed value of around 8.3, indicating that further extensions of the control horizon do not lead to additional cost reductions due to marginal effects. The initial decrease is because a longer control horizon provides the MPC controller with more information about the future conditions, facilitating better adaptation to anticipated changes and more informed decision-making. At the computational cost side, a larger control horizon tends to increase the computational burden since the solver needs to solve a greater number of decision variables at each control time step, which is depicted in Fig. 14(a2). Therefore, a 12-hour horizon yields the best choice, as it is sufficient to foresee disturbances such as ambient temperature and solar radiation, while also demanding less computational time. 4.2 Objective function formulation In this part, two MPC controllers with different objective function formulations are compared. MPC controller 1 focuses on keeping the indoor temperature within a comfort range while minimizing operating costs, as described earlier in Eqs. (9). MPC Controller 2 is designed to track indoor air temperature to reference values, set at the midpoint of the comfort bounds for each step, while simultaneously minimizing operating costs. The corresponding optimization problem is stated as follows: (11a) min u ∈ R m ∑ k = n n + m p e k ⋅ P h k 1000 + ω ⋅ ( T ˜ i k − T r e f k ) 2 (11b) s.t. T ˜ i n − 1 = T i n − 1 (11c) T ˜ i k + 1 = f T ˜ i k , T a k , I s o l k , Q ̇ h k , Q ̇ i n t k , k = n − 1 , \u2026 , n + m − 1 (11d) P h k = 1290 ⋅ u k + 1115 , k = n , \u2026 , n + m (11e) Q ̇ h k = 7221 ⋅ u k + 2220 , k = n , \u2026 , n + m (11f) T r e f k = 0 . 5 ⋅ ( T l k + T u k ) , k = n , \u2026 , n + m (11g) 0 ≤ u k ≤ 1 , k = n , \u2026 , n + m Here, T r e f k denotes the reference temperature at step k , which is calculated as the midpoint between the lower and upper comfort bounds, T l k and T u k , respectively. Fig. 15 demonstrates the Pareto frontiers of MPC Controller 1 and MPC Controller 2. Based on the zoomed-in views in each subplot of Fig. 15, MPC Controller 2 generally maintains a similar level of thermal comfort to MPC Controller 1 while having higher operational costs. The results suggest that although both controllers can effectively manage thermal comfort, MPC Controller 1 is more cost-efficient. This is expected as MPC Controller 1 tends to track the low limit of the comfort bound, whereas MPC Controller 2 aims to strictly keep indoor temperatures at the midpoint of the comfort bound, which leads to higher operational cost. 4.3 Comfort range tightening The comfort range tightening method provides a safety margin, improving comfort when the process model cannot accurately predict the thermal behavior of buildings. Fig. 16 presents the effect of different comfort range tightening values on the controller performance. In the scenario where w = 2 . 2 , the empirical results suggest that a tightening value of 0 . 4 ∘ C is the optimal choice for the overall performance during peak and typical heating periods, as demonstrated by the \u201cPeak + Typical (averaged)\u201d plot. When the tightening value is set to 0, indicating that no comfort range tightening is applied, higher total costs arise from an increased risk of comfort violation, as evidenced by Fig. 17. It is worth noting that variations in the weight w could influence the optimal choice of the tightening value, which needs to be determined through specific experiments based on w . 4.4 Optimization solver Since MPC requires solving an optimization problem at each control timestep, selecting an efficient solver is crucial for real-time control. Table 4 provides a summary of several popular open-source and commercial solvers that are commonly used in building control applications. CPLEX typically employs the dual simplex, primal simplex, or barrier algorithms for solving optimization problems. In our experiments, we used the default setting: dual simplex. Both ECOS and IPOPT utilize the interior point algorithm. From the implementation perspective, IPOPT is deployed by defining the optimization problem in the CasADi framework [37] and then calling the solver, ECOS is implemented by wrapping the problem in the CVPXY Python library [38] and then launching ECOS, and for CPLEX, optimization formulations are directly defined and handled within the software environment. All simulations are run on a computing platform equipped with an Intel Core i7 processor at 2.60 GHz with 31 GB of RAM. The performance of each solver is reported in Table 5. All three solvers yield identical operational costs and thermal discomfort during the peak heating period, while in the typical heating period, they maintain the same operational costs but CPLEX exhibits slightly higher thermal discomfort, compared to ECOS and IPOPT. The observed discrepancy in thermal discomfort is not surprising, as ECOS and IPOPT employ different algorithms from CPLEX and it has also been highlighted in [39] that IPOPT is numerically more stable than CPLEX. Furthermore, the CPLEX solver consumed the least computational time, outperforming IPOPT and ECOS with an average time savings of 29% and 12% respectively, indicating its high efficiency in scenarios that demand fast calculation speeds. 5 Conclusion This study focuses on the development and fair comparison of two Economic Model Predictive Control (EMPC) frameworks for optimal demand response in residential buildings. The first framework, RC-MPC, utilizes a reduced-order Resistance\u2013Capacitance (RC) network to represent the thermal dynamics of the building. The second framework, ANN-MPC, utilizes an Artificial Neural Network model trained on historical operational data to capture the building\u2019s thermal behavior. Specific MPC controllers, RC-MPC and ANN-MPC, are designed for each approach by incorporating future disturbance predictions, constraints, and an objective function. RC-MPC formulates the optimization problem as an LP task, solvable using CPLEX. On the other hand, ANN-MPC, based on neural networks, addresses a non-convex optimization problem using projected stochastic gradient descent. The simulation experiments are conducted in a high-fidelity single-zone dwelling using the BOPTEST framework. The results indicate that both RC-MPC and ANN-MPC effectively reduce operational costs and thermal discomfort, achieving comparable control performance and outperforming the baseline. In the multi-objective case, we observed that ANN-MPC is more sensitive to changes in the weights of objectives, emphasizing the importance of fine-tuning weights to meet specific control performance requirements. In terms of deployment complexity, ANN-MPC offers an advantage as it can accurately learn dynamic temperature models without requiring HVAC domain expertise. In contrast, RC-MPC requires engineering efforts to obtain physics-based building models, especially in complex multi-room temperature control scenarios. However, it is crucial to note that the data-driven model requires sufficient high-quality datasets for reliable model generalization, which can be challenging to acquire in scenarios with limited data availability or high costs. From a computational perspective, RC-MPC has an advantage as it generally requires less real-time control time. However, considering that MPC controllers for HVAC systems typically update action outputs every few minutes to several hours, the computational burden may not be a significant concern for deploying advanced building controllers. Furthermore, the ablation study on the RC-MPC controller was conducted to investigate the impact of MPC hyperparameters and provide practical implementation recommendations. The results revealed that a longer control horizon has the potential to enhance controller performance. In our case, a control horizon of 12 h struck the optimal balance between foresight and computational efficiency. Comparing different objective function formulations, we found that the formulation of the objective function is crucial in achieving desired performance. In our case study, the objective function of MPC Controller 1 is to maintain indoor temperature within the comfort bound while minimizing operational costs, whereas the objective function of MPC Controller 2 targeted at a specific reference temperature with the same utility cost objective. Both controllers effectively maintained thermal comfort, but we observed that Controller 2 tended to maintain higher indoor temperatures, resulting in higher operational costs compared to Controller 1. This highlights the importance of aligning the MPC formulation with specific control goals. The strategy of comfort range tightening proved to effective to manage the risk of comfort violations. This strategy is particularly critical in buildings where occupant comfort is highly prioritized, and the process model\u2019s predictive accuracy is uncertain. A setting of ϵ = 0 . 4 °C is found to be the best in our case study. The choice of optimization solver has an impact on both the control performance and computational efficiency. We found that IPOPT and ECOS could achieve slightly better solutions than CPLEX during the typical heating period while CPLEX provided the best computational performance. 5.1 Limitations and future work Given that ANN-MPC framework might exhibit varied responses to the hyperparameter tuning, future work could expand the ablation studies across different MPC frameworks. As all control algorithms assume a perfect deterministic forecast provided by BOPTEST, one potential avenue for improvement is the development of stochastic forecasts for BOPTEST, which is currently in progress. Additionally, focusing only on a single-zone model may limit the generalizability of the findings. It would be beneficial to conduct subsequent testing in more complex multi-room scenarios. Furthermore, the weights assigned to different objectives, such as operational cost and thermal comfort, determine the trade-off between them. This balance may vary depending on the occupants\u2019 preference. Future work could involve exploring automatic tuning of the MPC cost function to consider the occupants\u2019 preferences. Lastly, the application of building semantic models such as the Brick schema [40] to streamline and automate the development and deployment of MPC controller in real buildings is also worth exploring as a future research direction.

Appendix A.1 Discretization of the continuous state-space model using the forward Euler method The continuous state-space model, as presented in the main content of the paper in Eq. (3) is given by the following compact form: (A.1a) x ̇ = A x + B u (A.1b) y = C x + D u The forward Euler method approximates the continuous state-space model at the next time step value x ( k + 1 ) based on the current values of x ( k ) and u ( k ) as follows: (A.2a) x ( k + 1 ) = x ( k ) + x ̇ ( t ) d t (A.2b) x ( k + 1 ) = x ( k ) + ( A x ( t ) + B u ( t ) ) d t where d t is step size denoting the time interval between x ( k + 1 ) and x ( k ) . Upon simplifying the above expressions, the discrete-time model can be articulated as follows: (A.3a) x ( k + 1 ) = ( A d t + I ) ⋅ x ( k ) + ( B d t ) ⋅ u ( k ) (A.3b) y ( k ) = C ⋅ x ( k ) + D ⋅ u ( k ) Thus, the matrices A d , B d , C d , and D d for the discrete-time state-space model are derived as A d = A d t + I , B d = B d t , C d = C , and D d = D , respectively, where I denotes the identity. A.2 Explanation of initial wall temperature settings The initialization of wall temperatures is essential for simulations that accurately reflect the thermal behavior of the structure. The process to determine these temperatures is founded on basic principles of heat transfer. The heat flux Q ̇ , traversing a thermal resistance R , is defined by Eq. (A.4) (A.4) Q ̇ = Δ T R where Δ T is the temperature difference, and R is the thermal resistance. For a wall, considering an indoor temperature T i and an ambient temperature T a , the wall\u2019s temperature T e is set based on the heat flux equilibrium: (A.5) T i − T e R i e = T i − T a R e a By solving this, T e = R i e T i + R e a T a R i e + R e a , which is a weighted mean of the indoor and ambient temperatures, influenced by the respective thermal resistances. A.3 Definition of key performance indicators A.3.1 Thermal discomfort Thermal discomfort, measured in [Kh/zone], quantifies the cumulative deviation of the zone temperatures from their comfort thresholds, averaged across all zones. Here, \u201cK\u201d represents Kelvin, indicating the unit of temperature deviation, and \u201ch\u201d stands for hours, denoting the duration of the deviation. The formula for calculating thermal discomfort, denoted as K tdis , is given by: (A.6) K tdis = ∑ z = 1 N ∫ t s t f max T z , i ( t ) − T z , l ( t ) , 0 + max T z , u ( t ) − T z , i ( t ) , 0 d t N where T z , i ( t ) is the temperature of zone z ; T z , l ( t ) and T z , u ( t ) are its lower and upper comfort bounds, respectively; N is the number of zones; and t s and t f denote the start and end of the evaluation period. For example, for one zone, N = 1 ; the lower and upper comfort bounds are T z , l = 21 °C and T z , u = 24 °C, respectively; zone temperature T z , i = 25 °C; the evaluation period lasts 0.5 h from t s to t f ; then the thermal discomfort K tdis would be 0 . 5 h × ( 25 °C − 24 °C ) = 0 . 5 [Kh/zone]. A.3.2 Operational cost The operational cost, expressed in [\u20ac / m 2 ], reflects the energy expense and is calculated by: (A.7) K cost = ∫ t s t f p τ ( t ) P ( t ) d t A where P ( t ) denotes the total power consumed at time t ; p τ ( t ) is the price of energy under tariff τ ; A is the total floor area. A.3.3 Computational time The computational time, denoted as K time , quantifies the cumulative time spent on computation across all control steps within a test period. It is calculated by summing the durations of each control step: (A.8) K time = ∑ k = 1 M t k where t k represents the computational time required for each control step k , and M is the total number of control steps within the test period.

        "dc:description": "Model Predictive Control (MPC) has demonstrated its capability to significantly enhance energy efficiency while ensuring indoor comfort. This study focuses on the development and fair comparison of two Economic Model Predictive Control(EMPC) frameworks with the goal of optimizing demand response for utility cost reduction and ensuring thermal comfort in residential buildings. The first framework, known as RC-MPC, utilizes a reduced-order thermal Resistance\u2013Capacitance network model to represent the thermal dynamics of the building. It formulates the optimization problem as a Linear Programming (LP) task, which is solved using CPLEX. The second framework, known as ANN-MPC, employs an Artificial Neural Network model capture the thermal behavior of the building, It addresses a non-convex optimization problem through projected stochastic gradient descent. To evaluate the performance of these frameworks, experiments are conducted using a single-zone dwelling within the BOPTEST framework. The results demonstrate that both approaches effectively reduce operational costs and enhance comfort, achieving comparable performance and outperforming the baseline Rule-Based Control (RBC) method. The discomfort reductions range from 30% to 95%, and energy expense savings range from 17% to 34%. Furthermore, the study examines the impact of various MPC hyperparameters. The findings highlight that a proper control horizon and formulating the objective function accurately are crucial for achieving optimal control performance. Additionally, tightening the comfort range is found to be important in managing the comfort violations, and the choice of solver can influence both the control performance and computational efficiency.",
