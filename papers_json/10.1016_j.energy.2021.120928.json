Flemish Institute for Technological Research (VITO NV) Energy Technology Unit Boeretang 200 Mol 2400 Belgium The low-temperature operation of existing radiator systems connected to district heating is hindered by various factors, including non-ideal local control by users. The use of only a few of the available radiators to provide the necessary thermal comfort in an apartment is a common example. This requires a higher supply temperature and results in a high return temperature. This study investigated the potential of minimising the supply temperature of the radiator system to stimulate the use of all the available radiators in each apartment. Data from existing electronic heat cost allocators were used to detect the number of radiators not being used at any given time. A thermal/hydraulic model of the radiator system of a building was created to calculate the minimum supply temperature required according to the maximum pump operation. Energy-weighted average supply and return temperatures of 44 °C and 30 °C, respectively, could be achieved when all the radiators were used. The investigation showed that under the minimum supply temperature and a sufficient hydraulic balance, the required heat could only be delivered if all the available radiators were used. A good hydraulic balance could be secured by appropriately setting the balancing valves in each riser. Keywords Low-temperature district heating Radiator system Low supply temperature Heat cost allocators Hydraulic balance 1 Introduction The European Green Deal indicates that the smart integration of renewables, energy efficiency, and other sustainable solutions across sectors will help to achieve decarbonisation by 2050. District heating (DH) systems can contribute to the integration of renewable energy sources [1\u20133]. According to Heat roadmap Europe [4], heat sources like the fossil fuel power generation excess heat, heat from boilers, the waste-to-energy incineration excess heat and industrial excess heat have to be reduced as main strategic heat sources for DH by 2050. Sustainable energy sources like geothermal heat, solar thermal heat and large-scale heat pumps have to be added as main strategic heat sources instead. Hence, to be efficient, DH temperatures have to be reduced to the level of low-temperature district heating (LTDH), with supply and return temperatures of approximately 50 °C and 20 °C, respectively [5]. By lowering DH temperatures, the heat loss in the DH networks can be reduced [6,7]. The reduction of the DH temperatures and the distribution heat loss will decrease the primary energy consumption [7] and will reduce the heat supply costs [8]. It is estimated that Danish DH would save 2.2\u20132.6 billion Danish kroner every year by establishing and operating DH systems with lower temperatures [9]. Moreover, according to another study [10], the key indicator of Cost Reduction Gradient (CRG), which is defined as the levelized cost of heat in relation to the temperature reduction, is 0.55 \u20ac/(MWh°C) for the DH network with higher transmission capacity, 0.11 \u20ac/(MWh°C) with reduced mass flow and 0.07 \u20ac/(MWh°C) with reduced heat losses. In addition, LTDH systems can be part of the overall smart energy systems along with electricity and transportation system [11]. The first step to realise LTDH is to ensure the low-temperature operation of the heating systems in existing buildings. Then, design errors of the networks that create bypasses can be eliminated. The building sector must urgently prepare for the transition as the current high temperatures limit the possibility to integrate renewable and excess heat sources [8] Heating systems consistently underperform expectations being operated with excessive temperatures, despite evidence that the large majority are oversized and could use much lower temperatures [12]. In fact, the heating elements are typically designed for worst case scenarios and therefore they are large enough to ensure sufficient thermal comfort with operating temperatures lower than design ones. As a result, they can operate with a lower supply temperature for most of the heating season [13]. However, the control of these heating systems needs to be improved and possible errors in the system operation need to be detected and eliminated to secure optimal operation and low temperatures [14]. According to Østergaard et al. [15], the cost of heating system improvements, when and if it is necessary, was estimated and compared with the savings achieved if district heating temperatures were lowered from the perspective of both the total Danish energy system and the individual district heating customers. The investigations resulted in simple payback times of 1.2\u20134.3 years from an energy system perspective and 0.3\u201318.7 years for an individual district heating customer, which in all cases resulted lower than the typical lifetime expectancy of the heating system components. The most common heat emitters in the heating systems of existing multi-family buildings are water radiators. Water is heated in a central heat exchanger in the basement of the building. The hot-water is distributed through the main horizontal distribution pipeline and vertical pipelines, called risers. The main pipeline is located in the basement and the risers connect the main pipeline with the different apartments and radiators. The heat emitted from a radiator element is defined by the logarithmic mean temperature difference (LMTD) between the average temperature of the water inside the radiator and the room temperature. The LMTD is dependent on both the supply and return temperatures of the radiator. There are different combinations of supply and return temperatures that can result in the same LMTD [13]. The supply temperature to the radiators is controlled centrally in the DH substation based on weather compensation control [16]. The return temperature back to the heat exchanger in the substation is the result of the supply temperature selected, the pressure difference of the circulation pump, and the control of each radiator by the tenants [13,14]. A radiator is controlled using a thermostatic radiator valve (TRV). A TRV adjusts the mass flow rate through the radiator based on the indoor temperature set point. The TRV can be equipped with a pre-setting function that limits the maximum available flow through the valve when the valve is completely open [13,14]. New research work is using digitalization and remotely-readable heat meter data to target faults and improve heating performance to enable low temperature heating. Månsson et al. [17] showed how DH companies can use data from energy meters to help identify malfunctioning heating installations. In addition to the energy meters, heat cost allocators are devices mounted on radiators to determine the heat consumption of each radiator in a flat as a share of the total heat consumption of the building [18]. Heat cost allocation was first introduced in 2012 with the EU directive for multi-story buildings [19]. The new EU directive in 2018 [20] stated that all new heat cost allocators and energy meters must be remotely readable after October 2020 and that all existing ones have to be replaced by January 2027. Hence, the data relative to the heat consumption of each radiator are stored in databases and accessible remotely without the need to survey each apartment. For instance, if no data are recorded by a heat cost allocator during a specific period, it can be concluded that the specific radiator was not used. The wide use of heat cost allocators as a metering system can identify the relationship between energy savings and the behaviour of the end users [21]. Heat cost allocation companies register the heat output of each radiator, based on its size, type, and manufacturer, in an online system according to a set reference temperature such as 90/70/20 °C. This reference temperature is not necessarily the design temperature of the radiator system. Different reference temperatures can be used by different heat cost allocation companies in different countries. As a result, the current heat output of the system can easily be determined without depending on outdated design drawings. Design drawings are based on usually unknown design temperature conditions, and taking into account changes in the system through the years that are not recorded on the original drawings [22]. The low-temperature operation of a heating system is hindered by the inefficient control of the heating system centrally in combination with non-ideal local control by the tenants. A typical example of non-ideal control is the use of only a few of the available radiators to provide the necessary heat. This occurs because tenants have the impression that energy savings are achieved and the energy bill can be reduced in this way. When a radiator is not in use, the heat cost allocator stops counting the energy use from this radiator and the relevant cost is not added to the heating bill. Although, the heat output of the radiators in use is higher to fulfil the heat demand of the whole apartment. There is also a lack of knowledge on how a radiator is efficiently controlled by the TRV. They use the TRV as a proportional controller: the higher the setting, the higher the emitted heat. When only a few of the available radiators are used to heat an entire apartment, the required L M T D values of the radiators are higher than necessary. These higher L M T D values require a higher supply temperature and higher mass flow rate. Otherwise, it would not be possible to provide enough heat for the apartment, resulting in complaints regarding poor thermal comfort [13,14,23]. The janitor has to deal with these complaints. The most common action is to increase the supply temperature of the system and/or the speed of the pump pressure head. The increase of the supply temperature without addressing all the issues regarding the local control results in a high return temperature [13,14,23]. To avoid this common problematic situation, the tenants have to use all the available radiators to obtain the required heat. In this way, the L M T D of every radiator will be minimised, which will result in the lowest combination of supply and return temperatures for the system. When a tenant complains about poor thermal comfort, the janitor should be able to detect if all the radiators are being used. If all the radiators are being used, the poor thermal comfort is due to actual problems in the systems or the radiators. Actual problems can be air-filled radiators, stuck radiator valves, or problems with the distribution of water to all the radiators. If there are radiators not in use, he has to convince the tenants that the problem is due to their inefficient control. The electronic heat cost allocators mounted in the radiators can be used as a tool for the janitor to detect if all the available radiators are being used in an apartment. This study investigated a strategy to lower the operating temperatures of heating systems and stimulate the use of all the radiators. This strategy focused first on calculating the minimum supply temperature needed to deliver the necessary flow to all the radiators and to secure thermal comfort in all the apartments. Then, the strategy focused on investigating whether the delivery of sufficient heat was dependant on the use of all the available radiators in each apartment under the minimum supply temperature. Data from existing electronic heat cost allocators can identify the actual number of radiators in use at any time. The janitors can use these data, along with return temperature measurements in the risers, to address problems related to poor thermal comfort. These problems are either due to radiators not being used or due to malfunctioning components. Also, a poor hydraulic balance in the system can be identified by using these data. The investigation of the strategy was based on calculations using a thermal/hydraulic model of an actual radiator system of a multi-family apartment building located in Viborg, Denmark. Moreover, data from the actual heat cost allocators mounted on the radiators of this building case were used for this investigation. Problems related to heat transfer between neighbouring apartments were not addressed in this study. 1.1 State-of-the-art Several studies have aimed to reduce the operative temperatures of radiator heating systems. Leoni et al. [24] presented solutions incentivizing the deep implementation of measures on the demand side to reduce the network return temperatures. The information collected through the review of international success stories and interviews with stakeholders is used to derive recommendations for business models and propose new ideas for Austrian DH utilities that can also be used in other countries. Benakopoulos et al. [14] investigated the use of a low supply temperature in a multi-family building with radiators equipped with TRVs without a pre-setting function as a solution to achieve a low return temperature. However, it was not possible to teach the tenants how to control the radiators correctly. Tunzi et al. [23] focused on optimising the supply and return temperatures in radiator systems to achieve the required minimum L M T D according to the demand during the entire heating season. This study did not focus on how this minimum L M T D in every radiator could be secured if some of the available radiators were not being used. Østergaard et al. [25] investigated the theoretical minimum required supply temperature in typical Danish single-family houses constructed in 1900 under typical operating conditions. However, the study did not examine whether the actual control of the radiators by the tenants was based on the typical operating conditions. In another study [26], the focus was on investigating the impact of the occupant behaviour and radiator system malfunctions on the return temperature under low supply temperature operation. An extensive analysis was conducted of the different problems caused by specific control behaviours by occupants and possible solutions. None of the suggested solutions focused on reducing the supply temperature to the minimum required. Brand et al. [16] focused on reducing the supply temperature to the minimum without causing the occupants thermal discomfort. However, they did not focus on addressing the control issues with the existing radiator system. Østergaard et al. [27] investigated the use of supply temperatures as low as 45 °C for the main part of the heating season in Danish single-family houses from the 1980s. Their analysis was based mainly on model simulations with ideal radiator control. In a different study [28], a supply temperature strategy based on the required L M T D was proposed. However, the study did not focus on securing the minimum L M T D by stimulating the use of all the available radiators. In another study, Østergaard et al. [29] found that well-functioning heating systems in single-family houses can obtain a low-return temperature in the range of 25\u201330 °C, while apartment buildings can obtain a return temperature in the range of 30\u201340 °C. This indicates that there is a gap between the best functioning heating installations in apartment buildings today. Ashfaq et al. [30] found that the low-temperature operation of existing buildings is technically possible but the hydraulic imbalance of the space heating systems needs to be improved to minimize heat losses. Jangsten et al. [31] showed the potential for low operating temperatures in radiator systems based on data from 109 radiator systems in Gothenburg's DH system. However, they did not use data from heat cost allocators to secure the operation of the system. An adaptive control algorithm was presented in two studies [32,33] based on the optimal combination of radiator circuit supply temperature and circulation flow rate to achieve the minimum return temperature at each part-load. However, the focus was not on improving the control of each radiator element in the system to achieve the minimum L M T D . Yuan et al. [34] investigated a predictive model of secondary supply temperature based on the building thermal inertia and indoor temperature. Then, the modified model of solar radiation, the uncertainty of outdoor temperature and heat consumer behaviour on the heating parameters were established. An energy saving rate of approximately 5.8% was achieved. However, the occupant's behaviour cannot always be determined with high accuracy. This article presents an investigation of a strategy to stimulate the use of all the available radiators by minimising the supply temperature and ensuring that the heating system physically functions correctly. The novelty of this study was the use of heat cost allocators to locate errors in the system and understand the real operation of the radiator system. This has never before been presented in the literature. 2 Methodology The principle of the suggested strategy was first to make sure that in the building case heat cost allocators are mounted in each radiator. The signal from the heat cost allocators can be used to detect if a radiator is in use or not. Then, the minimum required supply temperature at each part-load was calculated and implemented in the system as a weather compensation curve. Under this minimum supply temperature the L M T D of all the radiators is the lowest possible. Under this minimum supply temperature the heat demand for each apartment can only be delivered if all the available radiators are in use. If only few of the available radiators are in use, the required heat demand for the apartment cannot be delivered, resulting in poor thermal comfort and complaints from the occupants to the janitor. The reason is that the required heat demand for the apartment has to be delivered from a smaller number of radiators. This results in a higher part-load and a higher required L M T D from the radiators in use. Although, due to the minimum supply temperature implemented in the system, the L M T D cannot be increased to what is required. This results in lower heat output than what is necessary to meet the demand of the apartment. When the occupants complaint to the janitor regarding poor thermal comfort, the data from the heat cost allocators can be used by him to detect if all the radiators are in use in the apartment or there is another issue that needs to be located and fixed. The investigation of a strategy to address the goal of this study was based on a stepwise approach on a specific building case of a multi-family apartment building: \u2022 Step 1 - Case study description \u2022 Step 2 \u2013 Use of heat cost allocators to detect the actual number of radiators used \u2022 Step 3 \u2013 Model analysis of strategy to stimulate use of all available radiators 2.1 Step 1 - case study description The first step refers to all the actions required to gather the relevant information about the design and the operation of the heating system of the building case: \u2022 Selection of the actual building case. \u2022 Information regarding the energy use and operating temperatures from the main energy meter \u2022 The registered reference heat output of the radiators at 90/70/20 °C from the heat cost allocator company \u2022 Information regarding the design of the pipe distribution system layout from the design drawings \u2022 Information about the pump. \u2022 Information about the pre-setting of the TRVs and balancing valves in the risers. All these information were used for building the thermal/hydraulic model of the radiator system of the building case. 2.2 Step 2 \u2013 use of heat cost allocators to detect the actual number of radiators used The heat cost allocator's company stored all the data regarding the measured heat output from every radiator of the building case in an online database. The heat output from each radiator can be measured at each hour during the whole heating season. As a result, it was possible to download information about the actual heat output from the whole system for any specific period. In addition, the actual supply and return temperature of the radiator system measured in the position of the heat exchanger was stored in this online system. By using the data from heat cost allocators, the part-load operation of all the radiators in the system could be calculated as the actual heat output from the radiator to the registered heat output ( Q 0 ) at 90/70/20 °C, according to Equation (1): (1) P L = Q / Q 0 When there are no data recordings of the actual heat output from a radiator during a specific period, it can be concluded that the radiator is not in use during this period. As a result, the heat cost allocators can be used as a tool to detect how many radiators in a specific apartment are in use within a specific period. 2.3 Step 3 \u2013 model analysis of the strategy to stimulate use of all available radiators A thermal/hydraulic model of the radiator system was constructed to calculate the minimum supply and return temperatures required when all the available radiators were used at each part-load. The building of the model was based on the information gathered regarding the design and the operation of the radiator system. By using the minimum calculated supply temperature at each part-load, two sensitivity analyses were performed. One to prove that under the minimum supply temperature, the required heat is delivered to each apartment only if all the available radiators are used. Also, to ensure that the strategy was not affected by users that still did not use all the available radiators in other apartments. The other analysis was performed to identify the influence of poor hydraulic balance by riser balancing valves that had not been set correctly. 2.3.1 Equations describing construction of thermal/hydraulic model The model used the registered reference heat output ( Q 0 ) of each radiator at 90/70/20 °C as an input. Different part-load percentages ( P L ) were added to the model as inputs. The supply temperatures ( T s ) at different part-load ( P L ) values were also input to the model. The return temperatures from the radiator system ( T r ) at different part-load values were calculated using Equations (2) and (3), based on the assumption that only the required actual heat output was delivered by each radiator (ideal operation). (2) L M T D = T s − T r l n ( T s − T i T r − T i ) (3) P L = Q Q 0 = ( L M T D L M T D 0 ) n In Equation (3), LMTD 0 corresponds to the reference conditions 90/70/20 °C and LMTD corresponds to the actual selected part-load operation with the selected supply temperature. The mass flow rate ( m ˙ ) of each radiator was calculated based on the part-load ( P L ) percentage and supply temperature ( T s ) used as inputs in the model and the return temperature ( T r ) calculated from Equations (2) and (3), according to Equation (4). (4) Q = m ˙ r C p ( T s − T r ) The sum of the mass flow rates ( m ˙ ) of all the radiators in the system was the total mass flow rate of the system. (5) m ˙ s = ∑ m ˙ r Each radiator valve was equipped with a TRV. The mass flow rate ran through the radiator and TRV. The TRV was composed of a radiator valve and thermostatic controller. The pressure drop across each radiator valve ( Δ P v a l v e ) is described by Equation (6): (6) k v = m ˙ r Δ P v a l v e where k v is the flow coefficient that relates the mass flow ( m ˙ r ) through the radiator valve and the pressure drop across the valve ( Δ P v a l v e ). If the valve is equipped with a pre-setting function, the values of k v decrease with the pre-setting position. The k v values were defined by the manufacturer of the radiator valve. If the valve was not equipped with a pre-setting function, the maximum value of k v s was applied in Equation (6). A minimum pressure drop ( Δ P v a l v e ) of 10 kPa was required for the optimal operation of the thermostatic sensor of the TRV. In each apartment of the case building, there is a manifold that connects all the radiators in the apartment with the vertical pipe or riser, allowing them to operate in parallel. As a result, the mass flow rate ( m ˙ m f ) through the manifold is the sum of all the individual mass flow rates ( m ˙ r ) of all the radiators connected to the manifold. The pressure drops of the flows from the manifold to the radiators and back are equal and defined by the largest pressure drop according to Equation (7), where the pressure drop of the TRV ( Δ P v a l v e ) is 10 kPa. The position of the TRV will automatically adjust the valve position to obtain the right flow according to Equation (8). (7) Δ P m f = M a x ( Δ P i + Δ P v a l v e + Δ P T R V ) (8) Δ P T R V \u2032 = Δ P m f − Δ P i − Δ P v a l v e The path from the pump to each manifold was modelled as a loop. Based on this, the mass flow rate ( m ˙ ) and pressure drop ( Δ P i ) in each pipe section were affected dynamically by the mass flow and pressure drop requirements of the pipe sections in all the included loops. The pressure drop of each pipe section ( Δ P i ) was calculated using Equations (9)\u2013(13): (9) v i = 4 m i ˙ π d i 2 (10) R e i = ρ v i d i μ (11) λ i = 64 / Re i , Re i < 2000 (12) λ i = 0.25 / [ log 10 ( e d i 3.7 + 5.74 R e i 0.9 ) ] 2 , Re i ≥ 2000 (13) Δ P i = ( ∑ ζ n , i + λ i L i d i ) ρ v i 2 2 where m i ˙ is the mass flow rate, v i is the velocity of the water, R e i is the Reynolds number, λ i is the friction factor, ρ is the density, μ is the dynamic viscosity, e is the roughness, ∑ ζ n , i is the sum of the local pressure drops resulting from the specific fitting of the pipes, L i is the length, and d i is the inner diameter of each pipe section. For laminar flow ( R e i < 2000 ), λ i is calculated using the Hagen\u2013Poiseuille equation (Equation (11)). For turbulent flow and flow in the transitional area ( R e i ≥ 2000 ), λ i is calculated using the Swamee\u2013Jain equation (Equation (12)) to avoid iterations of the Colebrook\u2013White equation. There is a pressure-balancing valve at the bottom of each riser. The pressure drop across each valve is calculated again using Equation (6), considering the mass flow rate through the valve and total mass flow rate of the riser. The k v values were defined by the manufacturer of the pressure-balancing valves and were different from those of the radiator valves. The minimum required pressure head of the pump ( Δ P P u m p ) was calculated by the model as the maximum pressure drop of the system, which was defined by the sum of the pressure drop of the critical loop ( ∑ Δ P i c r i t i c a l ) and the pressure drop of the critical manifold ( Δ P m f c r i t i c a l ): (14) Δ P P u m p = ∑ Δ P i c r i t i c a l + Δ P m f c r i t i c a l The critical manifold is usually placed on the top floor, at the longest distance from the substation. The model was also capable of calculating the increase in the mass flow rate and the return temperature in the system due to fully open TRVs that could not limit the flow to the desired actual heat output. The uncontrolled flow through the fully open TRVs was affected only by the hydraulic properties of the different loops dynamically for a fixed pressure head of the pump ( Δ P P u m p ). The uncontrolled flow ( m ˙ u n c . ) in each radiator with a fully open TRV had to be calculated iteratively using the dynamic hydraulic balance of each loop in the system, according to Equation (15): (15) Δ P P u m p = ∑ Δ P i , l o o p + ( m ˙ u n c . / k v ) 2 where ∑ Δ P i , l o o p is the sum of the pressure drops in the loop from the pump to the problematic TRV, Δ P P u m p is the selected pressure head of the pump, and k v is the flow coefficient defined by the pre-setting selected in the TRV. Equation (15), under the iterative calculation, was extended to the radiators with well-controlled TRVs to check whether as a result of the dynamic hydraulic balance, the pressure drop across these well-controlled radiators was sufficient to secure the required flow. The return temperature due to the higher uncontrolled flow or the lack of flow in different radiators is calculated using Equation (16): (16) ρ m ˙ C p ( T s − T r ) = ( L M T D L M T D 0 ) n Q 0 The model was constructed using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) in Excel. All the uncontrolled mass flow rates in the system were calculated iteratively in each loop. For each iteration, the results of the previous iteration were used as a starting point. The number of iterations used was 100 to ensure that the changes in the mass flow calculation from one iteration to the next iteration were negligible. 2.3.2 Calculation of the minimum required supply temperature at each part load The minimum supply temperature was calculated using the thermal/hydraulic model at each part-load with the maximum operation of the pump. A decrease in the supply temperature at each part-load increased the calculated mass flow and pressure drop in the system. The operating points of the system, consisting of the calculated pressure drop and total mass flow rate, had to be on the curve that defined the maximum operation by the pump, according to the pump datasheet. The supply temperature ( T s ) was reduced iteratively at each part-load until the calculated operating point of the system was on the maximum pump curve. In addition, a scenario with one fully open TRV in each apartment was introduced to identify the effect of open TRVs on the minimum required supply temperature. 2.3.3 Stimulating use of all radiators under minimum supply temperature The investigation had the goal of proving through model calculations of an actual radiator system that the reduction of the supply temperature could stimulate the use of all the radiators: securing the required flow and heat output only in apartments where all the available radiators were used evenly. A worst-case scenario was created by using the thermal/hydraulic model. In this scenario, all the available radiators were assumed to be evenly used with well-controlled TRVs only in one apartment at the longest distance from the pump (critical). In the rest of the apartments, the required heat was delivered using only approximately 2/3 of the available radiators, with fully open TRVs that resulted in uncontrolled flows. This scenario was tested for the maximum part-load conditions that occurred during the heating season by using the minimum calculated T s . The iterative calculation of the uncontrolled mass flow rate, based on Equation (15), was applied to all the radiators to investigate whether the flow was only sufficient for the critical apartment. The pump head applied in Equation (15) was selected as the calculated system mass flow rate to be within the pump limitations according to the maximum pump curve. After the recalculation of the flow in each radiator, Equation (16) was applied to calculate the return temperature and heat output from each radiator. 2.3.4 Improving the hydraulic balance of the system To identify the influence of a poor hydraulic balance in the system on the strategy, the k v values of the balancing valves in the risers were recalculated under the ideal operation of the system (all the radiators were used equally with well-controlled TRVs). The recalculation was based on ensuring that the pressure drop from the pump to the manifolds on the top floor of the building was similar. Then, the scenario presented in section 2.3.3 was again simulated by the thermal/hydraulic model using the recalculated k v values of the balancing valves. 3 Case study description The building case selected was a typical case of a multi-family apartment building from 1970 heated with radiators and high-temperature operation. The building case selected was, located in Viborg, Denmark. The Viborg DH company is focusing on invest in central heat pumps as the main energy source for the DH network. As a result, it is of great interest for the DH network to achieve a low-temperature operation from the heating system. There are 42 apartments with 235 radiators on three floors. Electronic heat cost allocators, which can be read remotely, are mounted on each radiator. The registered reference heat output of the radiator system at 90/70/20 °C is 296 kW. The reference temperature conditions of 90/70/20 °C are not necessarily the design temperatures. There is a manifold in each apartment. All the radiators of the apartment are connected to this manifold in parallel through flexible PEX pipes that are hidden below the floor. The manifold on each floor is connected to the main two-string distribution pipeline in the basement through vertical pipes\u2013risers. Each riser distributes hot water to three manifolds and apartments. All the different risers are connected to the DH substation through the main horizontal distribution pipeline in the corridor of the basement. All the radiators are equipped with TRVs with pre-setting. The pre-setting values of the TRVs are between positions 1 and 4 in different radiators. In addition, a STAD valve is mounted at the bottom of each riser. Each valve is set appropriately to secure the hydraulic balance between risers. There are two energy meters in the substation. One measures the total energy supplied to the building (MWh), while the second measures the energy supplied (MWh) to the domestic hot water (DHW) system as daily values. The total energy supplied to the radiator system during 2018 was calculated by subtracting the total energy supplied to the DHW system from the total energy supplied to the building. The energy supplied to the radiator system was 281 MWh. The circulation pump in the substation is a Grundfos UPC 32\u201360 model with three operation modes and a 60 kPa maximum pump head. The daily average part-load operation of the radiator system of the building was calculated by dividing the daily average heat output by the registered reference heat output at 90/70/20 °C of the whole system. Fig. 1 illustrates the daily average part-load operation of the radiator system during 2018 as a duration curve. Only two days had a part-load operation higher than 28%. All the information regarding the design of the radiator system needed to construct the thermal/hydraulic model was provided by the housing company. Additional temperature sensors were mounted on pipes on the secondary side of the heat exchanger of the radiator system to continuously record the supply and return temperatures. 4 Results 4.1 Use of heat cost allocators to detect the actual number of radiators used Two days between (February 12\u201313, 2020) were selected to investigate how many radiators were activated and whether they were used in an even way with the same part-load operation. The specific days selected represent a cold period in the middle of the heating season when the use of the radiators was a necessity to maintain thermal comfort. As a result, it was expected most of the radiators to be in use. An overview of the data showed that approximately 30% of the radiators were completely turned off, because no actual heat output ( Q ) was recorded on either the first or second day. This highlighted the problem that not all of the available radiators were used to provide the required heat, even with an average outdoor temperature of 3 °C during these two days. The part-load operation of the system during these two days, based on the reference temperature of 90/70/20 °C, was approximately 20%, according to data recorded by the energy meter. Fig. 2 to Fig. 7 show the actual heat output (W) emitted from the radiators and the part-load operation (%) based on 90/70/20 °C reference conditions, as it is recorded by the electronic heat cost allocators for three typical apartments during the examined two-day period. Although all the radiators were used in apartment 1, Fig. 3 shows that they did not operate evenly with the same part-load. The radiators operated with a higher part-load had a higher LMTD and higher return temperature. In addition, the reduction of the heat output of the radiator in the living room during the night between the two days increased the heat output of the radiator in the kitchen. The living room and kitchen are part of a common area. This example shows how the inefficient use of one radiator affects the use of another radiator in the same thermal zone. In apartment 2, according to Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 , only two radiators were used to heat the apartment, resulting in a part-load operation close to 30% and even 50%, instead of 20% if all the radiators were used. This is an example of a very problematic control by users. These two radiators were constantly open, resulting in high L M T D values and high return temperatures. In apartment 3, according to Fig. 6 and Fig. 7, another problem is highlighted: even if almost all the radiators are used, smaller radiators like the radiator in the entrance are difficult to control correctly, and operate with a higher part-load. These small radiators can often be the reason for flow by-passes and high return temperatures because they are constantly open if they are not set correctly. 4.2 Calculation of minimum supply temperature to stimulate use of all available radiators Fig. 8 presents the minimum supply temperature ( T s ) needed to obtain the required heat when all the available radiators are well-controlled (ideal operation) and for one fully open TRV in each apartment (problematic operation), as it is calculated by the thermal/hydraulic model, according to the maximum operation of the circulation pump. According to Fig. 8, the minimum required supply temperature is lower than 55 °C throughout the entire heating season, resulting in a maximum return temperature of 35 °C. The energy weighted average supply and return temperatures are 44 °C and 30 °C, respectively, when all the TRVs are well-controlled. During the two days of February 12\u201313, 2020, the measured T s was 55 °C and the measured T r was 35 °C. The part-load operation based on data from the energy meter was identified to be 20%. The minimum calculated T s at this part-load according to Fig. 8 should be less than 45 °C, which is a 10 °C reduction than the measured one. The expected T r is close to 30 °C, which is a 5 °C reduction than the measured one. This is the reason why the tenants can use only a few of the available radiators without feeling any discomfort. A higher supply and return temperature results in a higher LMTD heat output from the radiators in use. Assuming there was one fully open TRV in each apartment, it was necessary to increase the supply temperature to compensate for the increase in the mass flow rate of the uncontrolled TRVs and maintain the operating points of the system on the maximum pump curve. However, according to Fig. 8, the increase in the supply temperature calculated by the model was insignificant because of the hydraulic balance of the system, secured by the pre-setting function in the TRVs and the balancing valves in each riser. The minimum supply temperature ( T s ) calculated for each part-load operation could stimulate the use of all the available radiators in each apartment. When all the radiators were used evenly, the necessary heat for each apartment was allocated to all the radiators in proportion to their reference capacity. As a result, the actual heat output from each radiator, and the part-load, was the lowest possible. According to Equation (3), the required L M T D was also the lowest possible. This L M T D could be secured with the minimum supply temperature applied to the system. 4.3 Stimulating use of all radiators under minimum supply temperature: required heat is delivered only if all available radiators are used Fig. 9 presents the required heat in comparison with the actual heat delivered to each apartment when only 2/3 of the available radiators were used, except the critical one, under the use of the minimum supply temperature calculated at the maximum part-load that occurred during the heating season of 28%. The pump was located between apartments 12 and 13. According to the results in Fig. 9, the heat delivered was always lower than the heat required under the minimum supply temperature in all the apartments except the critical, where all the radiators were in use. More specifically, because of the dynamic operation of the radiator system, the flow in the fully open TRVs was controlled only by the pre-setting function of the TRVs and the balancing valves in the risers. The part-load is defined as the actual heat output emitted from a radiator to the registered capacity of the radiator according to equation (3). The part-load is reduced according to the increase of the outdoor temperature, because a smaller heat output is required from the radiator to meet the heat demand. The use of 2/3 of the radiators in all the apartments resulted in higher individual part-load operation for the radiators in use. When few of the radiators are turned off in an apartment, a smaller number of radiators delivers the required heat demand. As a result, the heat output from the radiators in use is higher to compensate for the lack of heat from the radiators not in use. From equation (3), this results in a higher individual part-load from the radiators in use and a zero part-load operation from the radiators not in use. The increase of the outdoor temperature would also reduce the part-load from the radiators in use but still it would be higher compared to the part-load of each radiator if all the available radiators delivered the required heat for the same outdoor temperature. This higher part-load requires a higher mass flow rate. However, because of the fixed minimum supply temperature and pump head, the mass flow rate in the fully open TRVs, calculated by the model from Equation (15), was lower than the required for the higher part-load operation. As a result, the heat output from the radiators in use was not sufficient to meet the demand at the apartment level. On the other hand, in the critical apartment, the total heat output was delivered by all the available radiators. As a result, the individual heat output of the radiators was the minimum possible. This resulted in a minimum individual part-load from all the radiators in use, according to Equation (3). Because of the minimum individual part-load operation of all the radiators, the required flow in each radiator was lower than those in the radiators in use in the other apartments. In addition, the sufficient hydraulic balance of the system secured by the pre-setting function of the TRVs and the balancing valves in each riser ensured that this minimum flow could be delivered to this apartment. It has to be highlighted that the reduction of the heat delivered in Fig. 9 is higher for apartments at a greater distance from the pump (apartments 20\u201341). In the apartments closer to the pump, the reduction of the delivered heat might not be sufficient to motivate the tenants to use all the radiators. This was because the non-ideal hydraulic balance between the risers results in a higher flow in the risers closer to the pump compared to risers farther away. The pressure drop distributions in the loops from the pump to apartment 15 at the top floor of riser 5 (close to the pump) and apartment 39 on top of riser 15 (at a longer distance from the pump) when 2/3 of radiators are used to deliver heat to all apartments except critical one at 28% part-load operation are presented in Table 1 . According to Table 1, the pressure drop in the main pipeline is higher for apartment 39 compared to apartment 15, as a result of the greater length of the main pipeline, as expected. The pressure drop in the risers, which is mainly consumed by the balancing valves, due to the existing settings of the valves, results in a high-pressure drop in the manifold of apartment 15 (close to the pump) compared to the manifold of apartment 39 (far away from the pump). This results in a higher flow in apartment 15 than in apartment 39, as can be seen in Fig. 9. To achieve a similar pressure drop in the manifold of each apartment, the setting of the balancing valves must be improved. By improving the hydraulic balance, the reductions in the heat delivered to all the apartments will be similar, and all the users will be motivated to use all their radiators to secure thermal comfort under the minimum required supply temperature. Fig. 10 presents the return temperature calculated from each riser and the overall system at 28% part-load operation when 2/3 of radiators are used to deliver heat in all apartments except critical one. The pump is located between riser 4 and 5. The critical apartment is located on riser 16. According to Fig. 10, the lack of flow and heat delivered to the risers at a greater distance from the pump results in a lower return temperature compared to the risers closer to the pump. As a result, a poor hydraulic balance in the system can be identified by using temperature sensors to measure the return temperature from the risers at greater and shorter distances from the pump. 4.4 Improving hydraulic balance of system by adjusting settings of balancing valves in risers The previously discussed investigation showed that under the minimum supply temperature, the required flow could only be delivered when all the available radiators were used evenly with the minimum individual part-load because of the established hydraulic balance of the system. However, in apartments closer to the pump, the lack of flow was not sufficient to stimulate the use of all the radiators. This was because of the non-ideal setting of the balancing valves in the risers to compensate for the pressure drop of the main distribution pipeline. The majority of the pressure drop in each riser was consumed by the balancing valves. As a result, the improvement of the hydraulic balance was necessary to ensure that in all the apartments the lack of heat would motivate the occupants to use all the available radiators. The improvement of the hydraulic balance was achieved by the recalculation of the k v values of the balancing valves to secure a similar pressure drops in the manifolds. The same scenario. Fig. 11 presents the required heat in comparison with the actual heat delivered to each apartment when only 2/3 of the available radiators are used except the critical one after the recalculation of the k v values of the balancing valves and the minimum supply temperature calculated for the 28% part-load operation. The pump location is between apartments 12 and 13. According to the model results in Fig. 11, with the improved hydraulic balance due to the improved settings of the balancing valves, the lack of heat was similar in all the apartments where only 2/3 of the available radiators were used, regardless of the distance from the pump. The required heat was still delivered only in the critical apartment when all the available radiators were used with well-controlled TRVs. As a result, this lack of heat should motivate all the users to turn on the rest of their radiators to secure the necessary comfort. This scenario proved that the strategy presented in this article can be a robust solution to stimulate the use of all the radiators when the hydraulic balance of the system is improved simply by adjusting the riser valves. The pressure drop distributions for the loops from the pump to apartment 15 on top of riser 5 (close to the pump) and apartment 39 on top of riser 15 (further from the pump) are presented in Table 2 . The results are calculated by the model, after the recalculation of the k v values of the riser balancing valves, when 2/3 of radiators are used to deliver heat in all apartments except critical one at 28% part-load operation. According to Table 2, the improved settings for the balancing valves secured similar pressure drops in the two manifolds. The increase in the pressure drop in the main pipeline for apartment 39 was compensated by the increased pressure drop in riser 5 of apartment 15 close to the pump. Fig. 12 presents the calculated return temperature for each riser and the overall system when only 2/3 of the available radiators are used except the critical one, after the recalculation of the k v values of the balancing valves and the minimum supply temperature calculated for the 28% part-load operation. The pump is located between risers 4 and 5. The critical apartment is located on riser 16. According to Fig. 12, the calculated return temperatures were similar in all the risers and did not decrease as a function of the distance of the riser from the pump. In addition, the overall system return temperature decreased after the improvement of the hydraulic balance. As a result, return temperature measurements in all the risers could also be used as an additional indicator of the hydraulic balance of the system and to detect whether the heat is well distributed among the different risers. 5 Discussion This strategy focused on reducing the supply and the return temperature of the heating systems to the minimum required level. DH networks that use or plan to use as main heat sources renewables, waste heat and/or central heat pumps can benefit from this strategy as lower operating temperatures is a requirement to allow their integration and for a high coefficient of performance (COP) of the heat pumps. The data for February 12\u201313 of 2020 from the heat cost allocators as presented in section 4.1 referred to Danish typical winter days and highlighted one of the common issues to achieve a low-temperature operation of heating systems: the occupants have the tendency not to use all the available radiators. The measurements also suggested that 10 °C higher supply temperature ensured to heat the whole apartment by using only a few of the available radiators. This avoided any discomfort for the end-users but it has the side effect of circulating higher mass flows through the radiators in use and as a consequence leading to high return temperatures. Only by minimising the supply temperature, the occupants would be motivated to use all the radiators, due to the lack of heat in case of not using all of them as supported by the results of the analysis presented in sections 4.2 to 4.4. The modelling work showed that this strategy may work and that the use of a minimum supply temperature may stimulate the use of all available radiators in every apartment. In addition, the TRVs with a pre-setting function and the balancing valves in the risers were key elements to secure the hydraulic balance of the system and made this strategy a robust solution. However, it is a prerequisite that the end-users must use all radiators otherwise they would experience some level of discomfort. By using all the available radiators, the actual heat output from each of them is the minimum required and the combination of supply and return temperature would be minimised too, according to Equation (2). The success of this strategy depends on the continuous monitoring of radiators through the electronic heat cost allocators and additional return temperature measurements in the risers. The janitor of the building can play an important role in this direction. He has to make sure that the minimum required supply temperature expressed as a weather compensation curve is always implemented in the control system and the pump operates at the maximum pressure head. It would be likely to experience, especially at the beginning of the strategy implementation, some complaints from the end-users due to possible discomfort. However, the janitor can now use measurements from the heat cost allocators to assess whether the lack of heat in an apartment, is due to radiators not being used, the poor hydraulic balance of the system, or malfunctioning valves. In this direction, the additional return temperature measurements in each riser showing an uneven distribution can support the janitors to detect poor hydraulic balance among the risers that needs to be fixed. It has been also observed that many people prefer not to heat their bedrooms during the night. Under this strategy, it is possible to isolate the thermal zone of one room from the rest of the apartment. However, all the internal doors to this room should be closed to ensure the minimum possible heat transfer from the rest of the rooms to this room. In this way, the heated area of the apartment is reduced. The use of the night-time setback for the whole apartment will affect the thermal comfort during the reheating period in the morning because of the minimum supply temperature used. However, this low supply temperature may increase the reheating period and minimize peak loads. The influence of the night-time setback under this strategy will be addressed in a future study. 6 Conclusions The data from electronic heat cost allocators of the building case highlighted the problem that approximately 30% of the available radiators in the apartments were not in use. In addition, a higher than the required supply temperature enabled the use of only a few of the radiators to deliver the required heat at the apartment level. Moreover, the data showed that the TRVs were not set correctly to allow the radiators to be used in an even way. As a result, the low-temperature operation of heating systems and consequently the low-temperature operation of the DH network is obstructed. A strategy to reduce the supply temperature to a minimum level and stimulate the use of all the radiators was introduced. The calculation of the minimum supply temperature was performed concerning the limitation of the pump. The investigation of the strategy showed that under a minimum supply temperature, the required heat could only be delivered to each apartment if all the radiators were used. To stimulate the use of all the radiators in all the apartments, the hydraulic balance of the system had to be improved to secure similar pressure drops in each manifold. This could be done by adjusting the settings of the balancing valves in the risers. The investigation of this strategy was performed only through model calculations of the radiator system. An energy weighted average supply and return temperatures of 44 °C and 30 °C, respectively, could be achieved in the heating system of a typical Danish building securing low-temperature operations. This may help to foster the transition towards LTDH by fixing some of the issues on the demand side. The success of this strategy depends on the continuous monitoring of the operation of the radiators in different apartments. This can be done by using data from electronic heat cost allocators, return temperature measurements in the risers and indoor temperature measurements in the form of an integrated service package in the future to assist the janitor. The janitor will be responsible to ensure that the minimum supply temperature is always implemented in the system and all the available radiators are used to secure thermal comfort and a low-temperature operation of the system. The implementation of this strategy to the actual heating system of the building case will be performed in the near future. The results will be reported in a future article. The influence of using the night-time setback under this strategy will also be addressed in a future article.

        "dc:description": "The low-temperature operation of existing radiator systems connected to district heating is hindered by various factors, including non-ideal local control by users. The use of only a few of the available radiators to provide the necessary thermal comfort in an apartment is a common example. This requires a higher supply temperature and results in a high return temperature. This study investigated the potential of minimising the supply temperature of the radiator system to stimulate the use of all the available radiators in each apartment. Data from existing electronic heat cost allocators were used to detect the number of radiators not being used at any given time. A thermal/hydraulic model of the radiator system of a building was created to calculate the minimum supply temperature required according to the maximum pump operation. Energy-weighted average supply and return temperatures of 44 °C and 30 °C, respectively, could be achieved when all the radiators were used. The investigation showed that under the minimum supply temperature and a sufficient hydraulic balance, the required heat could only be delivered if all the available radiators were used. A good hydraulic balance could be secured by appropriately setting the balancing valves in each riser.",
