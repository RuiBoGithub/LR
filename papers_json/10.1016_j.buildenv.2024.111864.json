Occupancy dynamics can significantly influence indoor thermal environments, especially in large indoor spaces. It is difficult for conventional feedback control systems to respond promptly to occupancy dynamics because of the substantial thermal inertia of large spaces, which leads to unfavorable thermal conditions in environments regulated by such systems. To address this challenge, this study proposes an air supply control approach based on artificial neural networks (ANNs). In the proposed approach, a large space is divided into multiple zones and an ANN model is used to characterize the relationship between occupancy dynamics and the supply air flow rates of each zone, thereby expediting the response of the air-conditioning system to occupancy dynamics. First, a multi-zone thermal environment model was developed to accurately emulate the thermal behavior of each zone. Next, employing the developed model of the environment, the optimal air flow rates required for each zone to maintain the desired thermal environment were estimated for various boundary conditions, which were used as pretraining data for four candidate ANNs. Finally, the best-performing ANN candidate, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), was adopted in a case study building via a comparison against several conventional air supply control methods. The results from the case studies demonstrate that the proposed approach can effectively expedite the system response to occupancy dynamics, thereby minimizing the occurrence of overcooling and overheating, and lowering the occupancy-weighted thermal discomfort level by 73.1 %. The proposed approach holds promise for real-time applications based on digital twin architecture.

Heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems have been developed to enhance indoor thermal comfort with the aid of control systems. Conventional HVAC control systems for large indoor spaces always manipulate indoor thermal environments by adjusting the supply air flow rates according to predefined rules or schedules without considering real-time occupancy dynamics [2,3], and thus may fail to achieve supply on demand. The findings of recent studies show that real-time occupancy dynamics should be considered to enhance the indoor thermal environment and/or reduce energy waste [4,5]. Thermal environment control for an indoor space should consider spatial and temporal occupant information to improve control performance. Spatial information is hierarchically specified from coarse to fine granularity, from the level of the entire building to individual rooms; temporal scales involve the day, hour, and minute; and occupancy scales pertain to the presence and number of occupants [6]. This type of categorization applies well to small-sized rooms [7] but may be ill suited to large indoor spaces. In large spaces, such as the waiting halls of railway stations and airports, occupant distributions and thus the cooling load might be severely uneven as occupants move freely within them. The conventional air supply control regards the whole space environment as uniform without consideration of occupancy dynamics. This may result in poor thermal environments and/or energy waste [8,9]. Therefore, it is necessary to divide a large space into multiple zones and factor in the number of occupants and how it changes in each zone, as illustrated in Fig. 1 . In literature, however, very few studies have taken occupancy dynamics in large spaces (i.e., the number of occupants and its changes across different zones) into account [10,11]. Reactive control approaches, such as proportion integration differentiation (PID) control, are widely used to adjust the supply air flow rates to rooms and force the room temperature to track a predefined set point [12,13]. PID works well for small rooms but may be inefficient in large spaces. This is because the thermal inertia of a large space is always substantial due to the large volume [14], rendering PID control potentially inadequate for promptly responding to rapid changes in occupancy [4]. This explains why overcooling and undercooling are commonly observed in large spaces [15\u201317]. Hence, a predictive control is advocated over reactive control. Through occupancy prediction, rooms could be conditioned before occupants\u2019 arrival [18]. However, this control approach places stringent demands on the prediction precision, such as the location and number of occupants [10], making it challenging to implement for large spaces\u2014especially when occupants can move freely within these spaces [19]. Consequently, improving thermal environment control for large spaces remains a challenge in present-day HVAC engineering. In recent years, the development of the digital twin architecture has introduced a potential tool for addressing these challenges. Building a digital twin is aimed at achieving accurate replication of building behaviors, which enables real-time or near-real-time operation of building systems [20]. For instance, a digital twin can be used in HVAC systems for online calibration [20], modeling and real-time updating [21], and dynamic fault detection and diagnosis [22]. The typical digital twin modeling process includes design, commissioning, and operation [23] and begins with establishing a design model for rapidly and precisely estimating building behaviors [24]. Notably, zone-building energy models based on ordinary differential equations, are used extensively in various building simulation platforms such as TRNSYS and EnergyPlus [25]. These models may yield fast and accurate results by assuming a uniform distribution of the indoor environmental parameters across a space [26], which is usually suitable for small rooms. However, these models may be unable to capture the thermal environment of large spaces, which are nonuniform due to uneven occupant distribution and load distribution [27,28]. Another approach is to use computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models. Although CFD models can achieve higher resolution than zone-building energy models, they entail solving Navier\u2013Stokes equations, making them unsuitable for real-time applications [29]. Therefore, a modeling technique that can balance model accuracy and computational efficiency is necessary for the application of digital twin architecture to large spaces. The building digital twin model can accurately replicate the energy and heat changes of real buildings and continuously update throughout their lifecycle [30,31]. The generated dataset from digital twin model can provide support for data-driven models [32]. Common data-driven models (such as ANN [33] and support vector machine (SVM) [34]) can simplify the modeling of complex physical systems through training with large amounts of data, achieving high-precision prediction and optimization, thus addressing complex problems under the digital twin architecture [35]. For example, Song et al. used CNN-LSTM to establish a data-driven thermodynamic model as a digital twin of buildings, achieving high-precision indoor temperature prediction (RMSE of 0.06) [36]. Hosamo et al. established a novel framework of digital twin of HVAC system (HVACDT) and used data provided by building information modelling (BIM) for ANN training, predicting the energy consumption and predicted percentage of dissatisfied (PPD) of an office building in Norway with accuracies of 88.67 % and 92.58 %, respectively [37]. These indicate that under the digital twin architecture, leveraging the abundant data generated throughout the building lifecycle to construct data-driven models facilitates achieving high-precision predictions. However, in the current field of indoor environmental control for large spaces, research on applying relevant technologies to predict and improve indoor environments is still relatively limited. Therefore, this study, proposes an ANN-based air supply control approach for large spaces under the digital twin architecture to address occupancy dynamics. The first step is to partition the large indoor space into zones and establish a multi-zone thermal environment model, serving as a digital twin design model; this model replicates the real thermal environment by considering the thermal coupling characteristics between adjacent zones in the large space. The air flow rates required to meet desired temperatures of each zone under different influencing factors (e.g. weather and occupancy dynamics) were optimized based on this model. Second, four ANN models were developed to build a map between the required air flow rates and factors; these factors were simplified using a maximum information coefficient (MIC) sensitivity analysis. Finally, the accuracy of the four ANN models were compared, and the best-performing model was chosen as the air supply control model. The contributions of this study can be summarized as follows: First, a multi-zone thermal environment model for large indoor spaces is established. This model enhances the original node model in TRNSYS by introducing virtual walls to depict the thermal coupling between adjacent zones within large spaces, addressing the issue of descripting uneven distribution of indoor thermal environments for large spaces. Second, a novel ANN-based air supply control approach was proposed to improve the uneven thermal environment with dynamic occupancy. This approach divides a large space into multiple zones and utilizes an ANN model to characterize the relationship between occupancy dynamics and the supply air flow rates of each zone, thereby accelerating the response of the air-conditioning system to occupancy dynamics. The time delay and thermal overshoot problems in conventional temperature control for large space are alleviated. This study proposes a solution that holds potential for application in the future of digital twin architecture in building. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the methodology, including the introduction of the multi-zone thermal environment model and ANN-based air supply control approach. Case studies, including a case study of a large railway station, are presented in Section 3. In Section 4, the control performance is analyzed, and the applicability of the proposed method is demonstrated. Section 4 also includes a comparison study of four conventional control methods, including an analysis of the enhancements within the proposed method in terms of thermal environment and time delay, both quantitatively and qualitatively. The conclusions are presented in Section 5, and the limitations and future research are outlined in Section 6. 2 Methodology 2.1 Overview The framework of the proposed study comprises two parts: (1) in a digital environment, establishing a design model for a large space and developing an ANN model served as the predictive model for air supply control; (2) in a physical environment, implementing air flow control in different zones of the large space based on predictions from the trained ANN model. Fig. 2 provides an overview of the proposed approach, illustrating the architecture of the digital twin system. This diagram intuitively depicts the flow of data between digital and physical environments and demonstrates how the proposed method is integrated into the digital twin architecture. In the digital environment, a multi-zone thermal environment model is first developed to replicate the thermal behavior of the large space. After zoning the large space and setting the desired temperatures, an air flow rate searching algorithm is proposed to interactively compute the required air flow rates for multiple zones under variable boundary conditions (such as weather conditions and occupancy changes). Subsequently, an ANN model is trained to learn the relationship between the required air flow rates and the various boundary conditions to formulate an ANN-based air supply control approach. Two enhancements are introduced: (1) To enhance learning efficiency, the MIC method is employed in a sensitivity analysis of input parameters in the pretraining data. (2) To improve prediction accuracy, the prediction performance of four common ANN models\u2014back propagation (BP), extreme learning machine (ELM), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and long short-term memory (LSTM)\u2014are compared. The ANN model that yields the best performance is selected as the final control model. In the physical environment, the proposed ANN-based air supply control, running on real-time monitoring data, is implemented in the large space. To validate the control performance, numerical simulations are conducted to compare the proposed method against four conventional control methods. Qualitative and quantitative analyses are then employed to assess the improvements in the indoor environment and system time delays when encountering variable boundary conditions such as occupancy dynamics. Considering the limited monitoring conditions, system uncertainties, operational changes, and building aging, continuous model calibration and updating are also essential to realize building digital twin. In this study, initial model calibration is included in Section 3.3. The grid search method was utilized to calibrate the multi-zone thermal environment model using measurement data. After collecting more operational data from buildings, the grid search method can be referenced for periodically model calibration and updating. 2.2 Development of a digital twin design model for a large space 2.2.1 Multi-zone thermal environment model development To depict the thermal environment more accurately, the large space is divided into multiple hexahedral zones. Horizontally, these zones are delineated based on independently controllable terminals. Vertically, the division is implemented with reference to the height of the terminals, distinguishing between occupied and unoccupied spaces [38], as shown in Fig. 3 . The heat balance of each zone is expressed as Eq. (1), where the index m denotes the m-th zone. The indoor heat gain ( q a , int m ) in each zone is categorized into heat gain from occupants ( q a , occ m ) and heat gain from others ( q a , others m ), like lightings and equipment, as expressed in Eq. (2): (1) ρ a C p V m d T a m d t = m s m C p ( T s m − T a m ) + q a , ext m + q a , int m + q a , coup m (2) q a , int m = q a , occ m + q a , others m where ρ a is the air density; C p is the air specific heat capacity; V is the zone volume; T a is the zone average temperature; m s is the supply air flow rate; T s is the supply air temperature; q a , ext denotes external heat gains, such as heat transfer through the building envelope due to solar radiation. This zoning method enables the description of temperature distributions and changes caused by occupancy dynamics in different areas within the large space, facilitating coordinated temperature control across zones and meeting the temperature requirements of various zones. The energy balance model after zoning introduces an additional thermal coupling factor, q a , coup m , which presents the heat exchange between adjacent zones resulting from advection, conduction, and diffusion. To facilitate the modeling, a virtual wall is introduced to enable the analysis of heat transfer between adjacent zones within the large indoor space. In contrast to physical walls, these virtual walls are intangible barriers that allow heat transfer across adjacent zones. The virtual walls serve to characterize the shared interface between adjacent zones (p), with a maximum value of 6, including p L, p R, p T, p Bo, p F and p Ba respectively represent the left, right, top, bottom, front and back adjacent zones. The calculation method is described by Eq. (3). The building in Fig. 3 illustrates left, right, top and back adjacent zones to zone m. (3) q a , coup m = ∑ p = 1 faces , p q a , coup m , p = q a , coup m , p L + q a , coup m , p R + q a , coup m , p T + q a , coup m , p Bo + q a , coup m , p F + q a , coup m , p Ba To determine the value of the heat transfer across the virtual walls, based on CFD theory, a microscale perspective is considered, where the boundaries composed by the cells between adjacent zones are also the boundaries of the corresponding mesh grids. The virtual wall is discretized into cells, as shown in Fig. 4 . In this regard, Peng's study [39] proposes a method of calculating the heat and mass transfer between adjacent zones that accounts for diffusion coefficients and air velocities. Central differencing and backward differencing are employed for the diffusion term and convection term, respectively. Additionally, it is assumed that fluid properties are independent of cell position. Using the finite volume method, partial differential equations are established for each cell, and the Semi-Implicit Method for Pressure-Linked Equations (SIMPLE) method is employed for the numerical solution. For a more detailed derivation and solution methodology, please refer to Peng's study [39]. An enlarged virtual wall diagram is shown in Fig. 4. Taking the virtual wall between Zones m and n located at position i a along the x-axis as an example, the heat transfer coefficients from Zone n to m and Zone m to n are denoted as a m , n and a n , m . These coefficients can be calculated using Eqs. (4) and (5) [27]: (4) a m , n = ∑ k = 1 N z ∑ j = 1 N y ∑ i = i a i a C p ( Δ y Δ z ) i , j , k ( D m , i , j , k + ρ a MAX [ − u i , j , k , 0 ] ) (5) a n , m = ∑ k = 1 N z ∑ j = 1 N y ∑ i = i a + 1 i a + 1 C p ( Δ y Δ z ) i , j , k ( D m , i , j , k + ρ a MAX [ u i , j , k , 0 ] ) in which, Δy and Δz represent the cell sizes in the y- and z-axis directions, respectively; D is the diffusion conductance; the subscripts i, j, and k correspond to the cell indices on the x-, y-, and z-axes, respectively; and N y and N z represent the number of cells in the y-axis and z-axis directions, respectively. In this case, the velocity u i , j , k is oriented along the positive x-axis direction. If the air flows from Zone m to n, u i , j , k is positive, and MAX [ − u i , j , k , 0 ] = 0 . However, if the airflow flows from Zone n to m, u i , j , k is negative, and MAX [ − u i , j , k , 0 ] = − u i , j , k . Eqs. (4) and (5) show that the heat flux is divided into two components: (1) heat flux due to turbulent diffusivity and thermal diffusivity, and (2) heat flux caused by air flow, which are expressed in Eqs. (6) and (7): (6) a m , n = ∑ k = 1 N z ∑ j = 1 N y ∑ i = i a i a ( Δ y Δ z ) i , j , k k eff ( δ x ) r + ∑ k = 1 N z ∑ j = 1 N y ∑ i = i a i a C p ( Δ y Δ z ) i , j , k ρ a MAX [ − u i , j , k , 0 ] (7) k eff = λ + ρ a C p ν t σ H where k eff is effective thermal conductivity; λ is the thermal conductivity of air; ν t is turbulent dynamic viscosity; and σ H is the turbulent Prandtl number. The general form of the energy balance equation, discretized using a fully implicit time-integration scheme, can be represented by Eq. (8) [27]: (8) ρ a C p V m d T a m d t = ∑ p = 1 faces , p ( a m , p T a p − a p , m T a m ) + m s m C p ( T s m − T a m ) + q a , ext m + q a , occ m + q a , others m where T a m and T a p represent the representative temperatures of Zone m, and adjacent Zone p, respectively. Taking Zone m as an example, the calculation method employed is formulated as Eq. (9): (9) T a m = ∑ i = 1 M ( V cell , i T cell , i ) ∑ i = 1 M V cell , i , where i is the i-th cell within the working zone of Zone m, and M is the total number of cells. The representative temperatures ( T a m ), can be obtained via simulation or actual measurements. Specifically, the average temperatures at heights of 0.1 m, 0.6 m, 1.1 m, and 1.7 m are used as the representative temperatures. These heights correspond to the ankle level, waist level, and head level for seated and standing occupants [40]. The working zone is defined as a space with a height ranging from 0.1 m to 1.7 m, located 0.1 m away from the solid wall boundary. According to the energy balance expressed in Eq. (8), heat transfer within the space can be categorized into two: heat flow transferred through virtual walls, which is related to the temperature difference between adjacent zones; and the heat flow within the zone itself. Therefore, the net heat transfer through the virtual walls, which is associated with the temperature difference between adjacent zones, can be expressed as Eq. (10). To characterize the heat transfer between adjacent zones in a large space, a virtual wall heat transfer coefficient, K m , p , is proposed and employed in Eqs. (11) and (12): (10) q a , coup m = ∑ p = 1 faces , p ( a m , p T a p − a p , m T a m ) (11) q a , coup m , p = K m , p ( T a p − T a m ) (12) K m , p = a m , p T a p − a p , m T a m T a p − T a m In contrast to other common simplified energy balance models, such as zonal models [41] and block models [42], the proposed heat transfer coefficient in this model considers both the air turbulence and thermal conductivity. Eq. (12) can be computed via simulation\u2014using user-defined functions in Ansys Fluent, or the derived values of K m , p in a previous study [27]. 2.2.2 Determining the required air flow rates The multi-zone thermal environment model allows for the assessment of indoor thermal environments under different boundary conditions. Therefore, it enables reverse searching for the required air flow rates according to occupancy changes and weather conditions. The process of searching for the required air flow rates in different zones is illustrated in Fig. 5 . The first step involves establishing a multi-zone thermal environment model. This begins with inputting initial conditions, such as indoor set temperature ( T a , set ), initial supply air flow rates ( m s ini ), supply air temperature ( T s ), time step ( Δ t ), and total time ( t max ). The temperature distribution in different zones under the initial occupancy and weather conditions is obtained by solving the model. In the second step, by comparing the obtained temperature distribution with the design temperature at time t, the air flow rates in different zones are searched continuously via interactive computing. The search process follows these rules: First, based on the results from the first step, the algorithm assesses whether the temperatures in all zones at time t are within the range of T a , set ± 0.2 °C. If the temperatures are within this range, the indoor thermal environment requirements are satisfied, and the required air flow rates can be output directly. Otherwise, the air flow rate is adjusted according to Eq. (13), and the updated air flow rate is reintroduced into the multi-zone thermal environment model for iterative searching. This process is repeated until the required air flow rate to meet the temperature requirements is determined. Finally, the algorithm calculates all the required results for time steps from 1 to t max , denoted as ( m s , r 1 , 1 , \u2026 , m s , r i , t max ): (13) m s i , t = m s i , int + Δ T a i , t γ where m s i , t represents the supply air flow rates for the i-th zone at time t, Δ T a i , t is the temperature difference, calculated as Δ T a i , t = T a i , t − T a , set , and γ is the adjustment coefficient, which is related to the scale of the actual air supply system and is specified as 1000 in this study. 2.3 ANN-based air supply control approach ANNs possess the capability to efficiently extract valuable knowledge from complex data, making them widely applicable in various domains\u2014including engineering, medicine, mathematics, and economics\u2014for tasks such as classification, regression, pattern recognition, and data mining [43]. Since the indoor temperature is affected by numerous interconnected factors, such as outdoor weather and indoor cooling/heating load, the design of the room temperature control is often complicated. Employing ANNs substantially simplifies the control process by directly establishing nonlinear mapping relationships between multiple system inputs and outputs. With this feature, air flow rate control no longer requires online search or iterative solutions, thus ensuring quick response and effectively circumventing the system response delays in the conventional control process. This approach is especially well suited for scenarios characterized by pronounced variations in indoor load, (e.g., considerable changes in occupancy) within a large space characterized by significant thermal inertia. 2.3.1 Sensitivity analysis Given the multitude of factors influencing indoor cooling/heating load, for the purpose of simplifying inputs and enhancing prediction efficiency, a sensitivity analysis was conducted using the MIC method [44]. Conventional correlation coefficients like Pearson's correlation coefficient are hard to capture complex and non-linear relationships between variables. MIC can not only discover the linear correlations in large data sets but also explore non-linear correlations. It is commonly utilized in machine learning for feature selections [45]. The fundamental concept of MIC posits that if there exists a relationship between two variables, it can be inferred by partitioning scatterplots in two-dimensional space and computing the mutual information of the variables. The calculation procedure is outlined as follows. First, given two discrete variables with n elements, A = { a i | i = 1 , \u2026 , n } and B = { b i | i = 1 , \u2026 , n } , the mutual information I ( A , B ) between the variables is computed as Eq. (14): (14) I ( A , B ) = ∑ a ϵ A ∑ b ϵ B p ( a , b ) log p ( a , b ) p ( a ) p ( b ) where p ( a , b ) is the joint probability density of variables A and B. p ( a ) and p ( b ) are marginal probability densities of variables A and B, which can be estimated using histogram method. Then, define a finite set D = { ( a i , b i ) | i = 1 , \u2026 , n } of ordered pairs. Then variables A and B are partitioned into a x × y grid G on a two-dimensional plane, and a i and b i are respectively allocated to x-bins and y-bins. D | G represents the distribution induced by the cells of G on D. Due to different partitioning schemes for x and y, the maximum mutual information value of the distribution ( D | G ) is defined as I ( D , x , y ) in Eq. (15): (15) I ( D , x , y ) = max I ( D | G ) where I ( D | G ) is the mutual information of G on D, and I is specified in Eq. (14). Subsequently, all the maximum mutual information values for different grids G on set D are normalized, as presented in Eq. (16): (16) M ( D ) x , y = I ( D , x , y ) log { min ( x , y ) } where M ( D ) x , y is characteristic matrix with normalized mutual information, and min ( x , y ) denotes the minimum value between x and y. Finally, the largest M ( D ) x , y among various x × y partitions is selected as the MIC for variables A and B, as shown in Eq. (17): (17) MIC ( D ) = max x y < B ( n ) { M ( D ) x , y } where the size of the x × y grid is chosen to be smaller than B (n). Generally, MIC exhibits good performance when B ( n ) = n 0.6 [44]. n is the total number of pairs for the variables A and B. MIC values range from 0 to 1, with 0 indicating no correlation between the two variables and 1 signifying a perfect correlation. The MIC method described above is employed to assess the relationship between input and output variables of the ANN model. After ranking the MIC value, the key factors affecting the output variables can be selected, thereby simplifying the number of input variables. In this paper, the ANN model is described using Eq. (18), where the input variables (I) represent the simplified influencing factors, and the output variable (G) represents the supply air flow rates. (18) G i , t = f ( I i , t 1 , I i , t 2 , \u2026 , I i , t n ) where i represents the i-th zone; t denotes time; n signifies the number of inputs after conducting the MIC analysis; f ( · ) stands for the prediction function. 2.3.2 ANN model development An ANN model is adopted to represent the prediction function f ( · ) . The ANN model was constructed in MATLAB and comprises a single input layer, multiple hidden layers, and a single output layer, with each layer consisting of one or more neurons. The neural network processes weighted input data from the preceding layer, adds it to the bias of the current layer, and then passes the processed data through an activation function to transmit it to the next layer. A typical schematic diagram of the ANN architecture is illustrated in Fig. 6 . Assuming that the ANN comprises of a total of K layers (where K > 1), with Layer (0) being the input layer and Layer (K) being the output layer. The neurons (x i ) in the input layer can be categorized into two types: weather (e.g., solar radiation, outdoor temperature), and the occupancy of different zones. These inputs are determined following a sensitivity analysis based on the MIC method. The neurons (m n ) in the output layer correspond to the supply air flow rates for the different zones. Hence, for a large space divided into well-defined zones, this is a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) control system. The number of neurons in each layer, from the input layer to the output layer, are defined as β 0 , β 1 , \u2026 , β K , and the dimensions of the input and output layers of this neural network are β 0 and β K , respectively. The output of the j-th hidden neuron in the first computation layer ( y j ( 1 ) ) is expressed as Eq. (19): (19) y j ( 1 ) = f ( 1 ) ( α j ( 1 ) ) , 1 ≤ j ≤ β 1 The induced local field for the j-th hidden neuron is represented by α j ( 1 ) , as calculated in Eq. (20), which denotes the weighted sum of the input layer vector and the bias vector ( b j ( 1 ) ): (20) α j ( 1 ) = ∑ i = 1 β 0 w i , j ( 1 ) x i ( 0 ) + b j ( 1 ) , 1 ≤ i ≤ β 0 The activation functions for each layer are denoted as f ( 1 ) , f ( 2 ) , \u2026 , f ( K ) . Commonly used activation functions include Sigmoid, as shown in Eq. (21); tanh (hyperbolic tangent); rectified linear unit (ReLU); and exponential linear unit (ELU). (21) f ( 1 ) ( α j ( 1 ) ) = 1 1 + e − α j ( 1 ) If the results from the first computation layer are used as inputs for the second computation layer, then the output of the second computation layer can be calculated as Eq. (22): (22) y k ( 2 ) ( X , W ) = f ( 2 ) ( ∑ j = 1 β 1 w j , k ( 2 ) f ( 1 ) ( ∑ i = 1 β 0 w i , j ( 1 ) x i ( 0 ) + b j ( 1 ) ) + b k ( 2 ) ) , 1 ≤ k ≤ β 2 By iteratively performing forward propagation, the input and output vectors of each layer within the network can be systematically computed until the calculation results at the output layer are obtained. 3 Case study 3.1 Building description A large high-speed railway station in China was chosen as the case study building. The entire station is between 15.0 and 21.8 m high and covers an area of more than 40,000 m2, as depicted in Fig. 7 (a). The waiting hall includes both a queuing area (highlighted in green in Fig. 7 (a)) and a seating area (highlighted in orange in Fig. 7 (a)), with nozzles (indicated by blue arrows in Fig. 7 (a)). For simplification, due to the substantial size of the entire waiting hall and its symmetrical layout, only the portion enclosed in the red box in Fig. 7(a) was selected for modeling and analysis. The red-boxed area is rendered as a 1:1-scale 3D model in SketchUp, as seen in Fig. 7(b). This building model includes typical functional areas and application scenarios of air supply systems in large spaces: P1 (seating zone), P3 (queuing zone), and C1 and C3 (corridors). It also considers thermal coupling between adjacent zones, represented by virtual walls in Fig. 7(b). Vertical virtual walls separated P1, P3, C1, C3 zones from each other. The occupied and unoccupied zones are distinguished based on the height of the nozzles at 5.2 m and are separated by horizontal virtual walls. Occupants and other internal heat gains are assumed to be uniformly distributed within each zone, and the air flow rates in each zone can be independently adjusted. The modeling process was as follows: (1) The building model was created in SketchUp. (2) This model was exported to generate an EnergyPlus input data file (IDF). (3) The TRNSYS auxiliary tool, TRNBuild, was utilized to read the generated IDF file. (4) Detailed building information was defined and modified using TYPE 56, including internal heat gains, building envelope parameters, outdoor weather data, and other specifics, as summarized in Table 1 . Weather data from the Meteonorm database integrated in TRNSYS was used [46], which provides typical meteorological year (TMY) data. 3.2 Control method comparison Evaluation of the proposed control approach was performed via comparison against the following four supply air control methods in a variable air volume (VAV) HVAC system: Control 1: Schedule-based control [47]. In this method, the supply air flow rate is determined based on a predefined daily schedule. In congruence with the railway station's service hours, the working hours for the air-conditioning system are set from as 07:00 to 24:00, and the supply air flow rates for each zone remain at its rated value during these working hours. Control 2: Return air temperature based control [48]. This method assumes that the air temperature across the entire large space is uniform, and the uneven distribution of the local temperature due to occupancy dynamics is not taken into account. Indoor environment is maintained at 26 °C with a relative humidity of 55 % by using a PID control to adjust the supply air flow rates. This method effectively eliminates temperature tracking errors and maintains the temperature within a narrow band around the temperature set point. Control 3: Zonal return air temperature based control [49]. This control also employs a PID controller to maintain the indoor environment in each zone at 26 °C with a relative humidity of 55 %. In contrast to Control 2, the monitored temperature is the return air temperature of the different zones instead of an average value from the main return air duct. It is a typical MIMO control system; therefore, the return air temperature can reflect the actual cooling demand of different zones. Control 4: Occupancy-triggered zonal control [50]. By monitoring the occupancy of different zones, PID controllers are used to adjust the temperature of each zone. When a zone is occupied, the temperature is set to 26 °C. Conversely, the temperature is adjusted to 29 °C to save energy in unoccupied zones [40,51]. Control 5: Proposed method . Outdoor weather parameters and the occupancy of different zones are monitored, and these data are feed into a well-trained ANN model as inputs. To meet the indoor set temperature (26 °C) and relative humidity (55 %), the output of the developed model is the supply air flow rate for each zone. Subsequently, this signal is transmitted to the terminals in various zones. The air flow rate is regulated by adjusting the damper openings at the terminals to achieve the required supply air flow rates. 3.3 Thermal environment model calibration and validation To validate the accuracy of the multi-zone model established in TRNSYS, a field test was conducted at a high-speed railway station on October 4, 2021. Test personnels recorded the occupancy and the representative temperature in the queuing zone (P3) using cameras and handheld electronic hygrographs at 1-min intervals. Testing took place from 11:00 to 16:00 covering three train departures at 2-h intervals. The station adopted a conventional scheduled air flow control, with a constant supply air flow rate during working hours. The building model parameters that require calibration are presented in Table 2 . The infiltration coefficient was set within a specified range based on summer testing results for a large space [52], and the building envelope parameters were set according to the design code [53]. In addition, the heat transfer coefficients for the virtual walls were taken into account. Given the presence of air entrainment between layers at different heights, which affects turbulence intensity and is a critical factor influencing heat exchange between adjacent zones [54], the virtual walls were subdivided into horizontal and vertical planes. Eq. (23) is used to calculate and adjust the heat transfer coefficient of the virtual walls in the horizontal plane [54]. For the vertical plane, values within the range recommended in Zhou's study [27] were calibrated to obtain an accurate model. The above parameter set (K) to be calibrated was determined by the grid search algorithm. The objective function using mean square error (MSE) is given in Eq. (24). (23) K m , p \u2032 = m a m ( 1 + k e ) C p ( T a m − T s ) A m , p ( T a m − T s ) where K m , p \u2032 represents the modified heat transfer coefficient between Zones m and p in the vertical plane; m a m is the supply air flow rate for Zone m; k e is the entrainment coefficient of a non-swirl nozzle, with a value of 0.32 [54]; and A m , p denotes the heat transfer area between Zones m and p. (24) MSE T ( K ) = 1 N t ∑ t = 1 N t ( T t , mea − T t , sim ) 2 where T t , mea and T t , sim are the measured and simulated temperature at time t; N t represents total number of time points measured. The validation results for the indoor thermal environment are illustrated in Fig. 8 , with the calibrated values presented in Table 2. In Fig. 8, the green line represents the real-time monitored occupancy in P3 (o P3), and the red curve and gray curve depict the measurement (T mea) and simulation results (T sim) for indoor representative temperature in P3, respectively. During the three recording sessions, the occupancy in the queuing zone gradually increased as passengers lined up for boarding and then gradually decreased after check-in. There was a positive correlation between temperature and occupancy as the occupancy changed, first gradually rising, and then declining. The simulation results exhibit a similar trend as the measured values. The minimum value of MSE is 0.055. The maximum temperature differences between the measured and simulated values for the three recording sessions were 0.47 °C, 0.46 °C, and 0.42 °C, all less than 0.5 °C, and the average temperature errors were only 0.12 °C, 0.03 °C, and 0.02 °C, respectively. Therefore, the multi-zone thermal environment model established in TRNSYS can simulate the temperature changes caused by occupancy dynamics and can be used to evaluate the control performance of the proposed method. 3.4 ANN model settings 3.4.1 Data sources and sensitivity analysis results Based on the established multi-zone thermal environment model, a MATLAB-TRNSYS co-simulation can provide the theoretical required air flow rates under different boundary conditions, which serves as data for pretraining the ANN model. The description of the data sources for co-simulation is as follows: The dataset includes meteorological parameters and indoor occupancy. The meteorological data span the cooling season of a year, totaling 92 days: 7:00 to 24:00 daily, from June 15th to September 15th. Occupancy data were categorized according to the functional zones. P1 represents the queuing zone, and its variations were fitted to test data from the Lan's study [8]. P3 corresponds to the seating zone, and its occupancy varies in accordance with a cosine pattern, with a range of 100\u2013150 occupants, according to the test results. Data were collected at 1-min intervals, cumulating to 99,360 data points. The dataset was divided into a training set and a testing set using a ratio of 8:2. The training data should ideally encompass all operational conditions required to train the inverse model, but in practice, this proves particularly challenging for complex systems such as large-space air supply systems. Given the multitude of possible real-world scenarios, it is hard to cover all possibilities comprehensively. Therefore, only one year of data was simulated in this study for pre-training purposes. Continuous collection and updating of the dataset are also feasible. During the data preprocessing stage, considering that different variables have different units, normalization was performed using Eq. (25) to transform the data into appropriate scales for further analysis. (25) x i \u2032 = x i − x i , min x i , max − x i , min where x i is the raw data; x i \u2032 denotes the normalized data; and the maximum and minimum values of the input raw data are denoted by x i , max and x i , min , respectively. The MIC method was then employed to simplify the input variables. Six meteorological parameters (dry bulb temperature, wet bulb temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, horizontal beam radiation, and global horizontal radiation) were considered. Fig. 9 provides the results of the MIC correlation analysis for all weather parameters with regard to the required air flow rates. Meteorological parameters that exhibit a significant correlation with the required air flow rates (MIC >0.5) are selected, as shown in Fig. 9. In addition to the occupancy dynamics, the other variables\u2014in descending order of correlation\u2014are dry bulb temperature, horizontal beam radiation, global horizontal radiation, and relative humidity, making a total of five variables used as inputs for the ANN model. These variables were utilized directly for predicting real-time air flow rates. 3.4.2 Hyperparameter tuning To cover a diverse range of neural network architectures and broad applicability, candidate ANN models were selected from three representative categories of neural networks: (1) Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs): BP and ELM were selected for its general-purpose learning capabilities and broad applicability; (2) Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Standard CNNs were chosen for their superior performance in image and spatial data tasks; (3) Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): LSTM was chosen due to its effective handling of temporal sequences and dependencies. Different hyperparameters were adjusted to achieve a good prediction performance. The hyperparameter tuning was performed using a consistent dataset for the optimization of all hyperparameters in MATLAB. Hyperparameter tuning was performed using a grid search strategy. Initially, each hyperparameter was set to its default value, and adjustments were then made sequentially following the order specified in Table 3 , and other parameters were kept at their default values. The hyperparameter tuning was guided by the principle of simplicity, as follows: (1) The number of hidden layers were kept as low as possible; starting with one and then testing two hidden layers. (2) The number of neurons in the hidden layers followed rule-of-thumb methods, and were generally less than twice the size of the input layer [55]. (3) Some common activation functions and optimizers were utilized. (4) After each epoch, the performance of the model was tested, and training was stopped early when there was no further improvement in performance, thereby compromising network complexity and training time to prevent overfitting. 3.4.3 Evaluation indicators Three indicators, the coefficient of determination (R 2), mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean square error (RMSE), were used to assess the prediction performance of the ANN models. R 2, expressed as Eq. (26), is a measure of the correlation between two variables; a high R 2 value indicates high prediction performance. MAE, expressed as Eq. (27), measures the MAE between the predicted and actual values, and is negligibly sensitive to outliers, making it a robust indicator. RMSE, expressed as Eq. (28), is especially sensitive to outliers; hence, it is used to penalize large errors significantly. (26) R 2 = 1 − ∑ i = 1 n ( Y i − Y ˆ i ) 2 ∑ i = 1 n ( Y i − Y i \u203e ) 2 (27) MAE = 1 n ∑ i = 1 n ( | Y ˆ i − Y i | ) (28) RMSE = 1 n ∑ i = 1 n ( Y ˆ i − Y i ) 2 where n represents the total number of samples; Y ˆ i represents the predicted value for the i-th sample; Y i represents the actual value for the i-th sample (the required air flow rates in this study); and Y i \u203e represents the mean value of all Y i . 4 Results and discussion 4.1 Control performance in different zones of the large space First, the performance of Controls 1 to 4 in the seating zone (P1) was analyzed. The indoor temperature changes are presented in Figs. 10 and 11 . In Fig. 10, the green line represents fluctuations in occupancy of P1. Control 1 maintained a constant air flow rate, resulting in room temperature fluctuations throughout the day, with the highest temperature being 29.0 °C. Control 2, which adjusted the supply air flow rate according to the average temperature of the entire space, resulted in indoor temperatures above the set temperature of 26.0 °C all day. Uniform airflow throughout the space was insufficient to meet the thermal demand of P1. In contrast, Controls 3 and 4, in which air flow rate was controlled based on the occupancy dynamics, performed similarly because P1 was always occupied. Excluding the calculations that had not yet converged at the beginning, these controls can maintain temperatures within the 26.0 ± 0.5 °C range. This indicates that in large spaces where occupancy changes are relatively stable, controls 3 and 4 based on the actual zonal occupancy are the effective approaches. P3 is a queuing zone with apparent occupancy dynamics, and its occupancy was dynamically set according to the boarding schedule (indicated by the green line in Fig. 11). Similar to P1, Control 1 resulted in indoor temperature variations, with the temperatures being too low in the morning and evening and too high around noon. Control 2 partially mitigates this issue; however, overcooling was observed when the zone was unoccupied between 7:00 to 10:00 and 19:00 to 00:00. Control 4 is utilized primarily for energy-saving purposes, adjusting to the setback temperature when this zone was unoccupied. However, two issues were observed: (1) Due to the large thermal inertia, it takes a long time to adjust the temperature of the space from the setback temperature to the set temperature; and even before conditions fully converge to a stable state, the next process commences. (2) With the PID control, there was a significant temperature fluctuation, with the highest temperature being 32.3 °C and the lowest being 24.3 °C. Control 3 (brown line in Fig. 11) performed relatively better than the other three control methods. Despite temperature fluctuations caused by occupancy changes, the PID control could still maintain temperatures within the range of 24.9\u201327.4 °C. Therefore, Control 3, which delivered the best performance, is ultimately chosen as the benchmark for comparison with the proposed method. Unoccupied zones C1 and C3 (which are corridors) were also analyzed using Control 3 (the benchmark), as seen in Fig. 12 . Due to the thermal coupling relationship between adjacent zones in the large space, although C1 and C3 are corridors, they experienced minor temperature fluctuations induced by occupancy changes in adjacent P1 and P3. Control 3 can effectively maintain temperatures within the range of 26.0 ± 0.2 °C in C1 and C3 (Fig. 12), achieving the required indoor temperature. For seating zone P1, indoor temperature was directly impacted by occupancy changes. Since the fluctuations in occupancy were not significant, temperatures could also be maintained within 26 ± 0.5 °C, which is acceptable. To facilitate a detailed examination of the temperature changes in P3, a portion of the test results (for 09:00 to 11:00) in Fig. 12 is magnified and presented separately. For P3, however, due to fast changes in occupancy, the PID control oscillated significantly, leading to instances of excessively high and low temperatures during some periods, with the highest temperature being 27.4 °C and the lowest being 24.9 °C. Therefore, there is a need to focus on improving existing controls for zones with obvious fluctuations in occupancy, such as P3 in this study. 4.2 Comparative analysis of ANN models To obtain the air flow rate quickly and accurately, real-time air flow rate predictions for P3 were made using different ANN models. First, a comparison of the prediction performance of different ANN models was conducted, as described in Section 3.4. The best performing ANN model among BP, ELM, CNN, and LSTM was selected for air flow rate control, with detailed structures and training parameters provided in Table 4 . Fig. 13 illustrates the structures of the ANNs. The predictive results of the four ANN models were evaluated based on three performance indicators: R 2, MAE, and RMSE, and results are shown in Table 5 . Fig. 14 shows that among all the ANN models, LSTM records the highest R 2 value on the test dataset (R 2 = 0.915), indicating the closest congruence with the required air flow rate results and achievement of the best prediction performance. The prediction performance of the four ANN models is broadly similar, and LSTM records the smallest errors in MAE and RMSE (Table 5). To provide a more intuitive assessment of the prediction performance, the air flow rate predictions on the test day are compared in Fig. 15 . There is little difference between the four prediction results on the test day, and LSTM (the orange line in Fig. 15) yields the predictions closest to the required air flow rate results (the black line in Fig. 15) between 13:00 and 19:00. In summary, multiple indicator evaluation results in Table 5 demonstrate that the LSTM model has the overall best prediction performance, both on the test dataset and the test day. Therefore, the LSTM model with the best prediction performance was adopted for air flow rate control in this study. This superior performance is likely due to the nature of the input training data, such as occupancy and meteorological data, which are both time-series data. LSTM's structure, with its gates and memory cells, is better equipped to capture the temporal relationships in the dataset compared to simpler architectures like BP or ELM. The final values of the LSTM parameters are presented in Table 4. 4.3 Performance evaluation via comparison 4.3.1 Qualitative analysis The variation in the air flow rate with the occupancy dynamics in P3 for the three controls are illustrated in Fig. 16 . The required air flow rate (blue line) and the LSTM outputs (orange line) increase synchronously as soon as occupancy increases. The LSTM outputs show a peak time of Δt 1, while Control 3 has a peak time of Δt 1 + Δt 2, which results in a time delay of Δt 2 (approximately 5 mins). The proposed method, despite displaying a higher overshoot in comparison to Control 3, demonstrates minimal oscillation and quickly converges to the set point, as opposed to the fluctuations observed in Control 3. This allows for a rapid reduction in temperature to the set point and a reduced temperature change delay. Subsequently, a comparative analysis of the proposed method and the benchmark method was performed to evaluate their respective indoor temperature control performance. Temperature changes under three air flow rate control approaches are presented in Fig. 17 . As the indoor temperature set point is 26.0 °C on the test day, three thermal conditions are defined: temperatures between 25.5 and 26.5 °C, which are labeled as moderate; temperatures below 25.5 °C, which are considered overcooling; and temperatures above 26.5 °C, which are categorized as overheating. As depicted in Fig. 17, Control 3, utilizing PID feedback control, produced in fluctuations in indoor temperature throughout the test day; conversely, adopting both the LSTM outputs and the required air flow rates achieved a smoother indoor temperature change profile. To provide a detailed examination of the temperature control, the period from 9:00 to 11:00, is enlarged in Fig. 17. Compared to Control 3, PID control required a long settling time (Δt 3 = 41 mins) to adjust the temperature within ±0.2 °C of the set point. In addition, during this process, occasional episodes of overheating and overcooling occurred. However, the LSTM method effectively reduced temperature fluctuations, decreasing the maximum temperature difference from 2.42 °C to 0.94 °C. Although some tracking deviation in temperature persisted, the temperature remained within a moderate and acceptable range. Therefore, in terms of overall control performance in a large space, especially with significant fluctuations in occupancy, the proposed LSTM method is more effective compared to the conventional PID feedback control methods. 4.3.2 Quantitative analysis Several indicators were used to quantitatively assess and compare the control performance of the tested methods. First, an analysis of the time percentage of different thermal conditions is shown in Fig. 18 . Control 3 maintained the entire zone in moderate for approximately 80.5 % of the time on the test day. After searching for the required air flow rate, it was expected that this proportion would reach 100 %. In the practical application, however, when LSTM was used, the proportion was slightly less, 97.5 %. Compared to Control 3, the performance of the proposed method was still much more effective, increasing the time during which the large space remained in moderate by 17.0 %. In addition, the proportion of time in overheating and overcooling was reduced, the overcooling time reduced from 10.9 % to 2.5 %, and the occurrence of overheating was effectively prevented. Furthermore, an occupancy-weighted thermal discomfort indicator was employed to assess the impact of the thermal environment on occupants\u2019 thermal comfort within a zone. This indicator is expressed as Eq. (29) [50]: (29) D i s c o m f o r t = ( T i , t − T i , set ) × t × o i , occ where T i , t represents the representative temperature of the i-th zone at time t; T i , set is the set temperature for the i-th zone; and o i , occ denotes the total number of occupants in the i-th zone. A small value for this indicator means that the indoor temperature in the i-th zone at time t deviates less from the set temperature, which affects fewer occupants, and thus indicates better control performance. In addition, integrating this indicator over time yields an evaluation of discomfort within a time period. Summaries of the Discomfort distributions for three control approaches employed on the test day are presented in Fig. 19 . As shown, when the required air flow rate and LSTM results were used, Discomfort<25 occurred 99.9 % and 98.9 % of the time, respectively. Control 3, on the other hand, recorded a lower proportion of time (93.8 %) below the comfort threshold, with a distribution skewed further to the right, indicating a higher occurrence of extreme discomfort situations. Furthermore, the data in the summary table of statistical indicators reveals that Control 3 consistently exhibits significantly higher total, peak, and average Discomfort levels. After obtaining the required air flow rate, the control performance was highly favorable (with an average Discomfort level of only 0.67). When LSTM is employed as the best performing ANN model, the average Discomfort level apparently increases compared to the theoretical results (required air flow rate), up to 1.36. However, it still results in a 73.1 % improvement compared to Control 3 (5.05). The variations in Discomfort levels throughout the day are illustrated in Fig. 20 . It is evident that nearly every instance of occupants congregating in P3 results in a notable increase in Discomfort. With Control 3, in particular, when the number of occupants suddenly increases, temperature fluctuations become more pronounced. This amplification effect leads to a rapid, exponential rise in the Discomfort level. For instance, around 10:00, the Discomfort index reached a peak value of 258.94. However, in the implementation of the LSTM method, the Discomfort level was effectively below 50\u2014which corresponds to a level of comfort considered acceptable\u2014during such situations. In summary, compared to Control 3 (the benchmark), the proposed method increases the time percentage of moderate by 17.0 %, reduces occurrences of overcooling and overheating, and effectively lowers the occupancy-weighted Discomfort level by 73.1 %. 5 Conclusions Under the digital twin architecture, an ANN-based air supply control approach for large spaces considering occupancy dynamics is proposed in this study. This method effectively reduced the time delay of air supply systems and enhanced the indoor thermal environment of large spaces. The main conclusions from the findings of this study are as follows. 1) The multi-zone thermal environment model, based on the concept of virtual walls can be adopted as a design model for emulating the thermal behaviors of large spaces and to reflect the thermal coupling relationships among adjacent zones. 2) Control 3 can be used as a benchmark. It can meet the control requirements of indoor environments in unoccupied zones and zones with no obvious occupancy dynamics in large spaces. Zones with obvious occupancy dynamics require further improvement. 3) The trained LSTM model can directly establish the map between occupancy and the supply air flow rate of each zone to achieve a fast and accurate air supply. 4) Compared to the Control 3, the simulation results show that the proposed method can increase the time percentage of moderate thermal conditions in a large space by 17.0 % and reduce the maximum temperature from 2.42 °C to 0.94 °C, thus minimizing occurrences of overcooling and overheating. 5) In the case study, the proposed method effectively lowered the occupancy-weighted thermal discomfort level by 73.1 % compared to Control 3, thus improving the thermal comfort of occupants in the occupied zones of large spaces. Overall, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed air supply method for improving the indoor thermal environment of large spaces, with potential applications in building HVAC controls and occupant well-being. Limitations and future research This study is primarily based on simulation results and comparative analysis of different methods. Further experimental research is needed. First, it is crucial to obtain historical datasets from real buildings for training to establish an accurate multi-zone thermal environment model. Fortunately, with the development of the Internet of Things, long-term monitoring data from existing buildings can be utilized for the periodically calibration and updating of multi-zone thermal environment models, and continuously used for training ANN models. This will contribute to achieving accurate digital twins of buildings and ensuring the robustness of the proposed method. In the future, we will further focus on collecting on-site data and deploying the proposed control approach. In particular, model calibration, model tuning, and integrating these methods into the proposed approach requires refinement and further investigation. Additionally, due to the straightforward nature of the regression problem addressed in this study (predicting air flow rate based on multiple influencing factors), and the prediction results of the basic ANN models (BP, ELM, CNN, LSTM) performed well (R 2 > 0.9), more advanced models such as CNN-LSTM or BiLSTM were not considered. However, it is acknowledged that more advanced neural network models could further improve prediction accuracy and enhance control performance. Therefore, testing and validating a wider range of ANN models will be a focus of our future work. Furthermore, this study validated the proposed method using a VAV HVAC system. For other types of HVAC systems, such as constant air volume (CAV) systems, further exploration of the proposed method is needed. Although the methodology framework is universal, adapting this method to different types of large space buildings still requires further development to verify the applicability of the proposed method.

        "dc:description": "Occupancy dynamics can significantly influence indoor thermal environments, especially in large indoor spaces. It is difficult for conventional feedback control systems to respond promptly to occupancy dynamics because of the substantial thermal inertia of large spaces, which leads to unfavorable thermal conditions in environments regulated by such systems. To address this challenge, this study proposes an air supply control approach based on artificial neural networks (ANNs). In the proposed approach, a large space is divided into multiple zones and an ANN model is used to characterize the relationship between occupancy dynamics and the supply air flow rates of each zone, thereby expediting the response of the air-conditioning system to occupancy dynamics. First, a multi-zone thermal environment model was developed to accurately emulate the thermal behavior of each zone. Next, employing the developed model of the environment, the optimal air flow rates required for each zone to maintain the desired thermal environment were estimated for various boundary conditions, which were used as pretraining data for four candidate ANNs. Finally, the best-performing ANN candidate, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), was adopted in a case study building via a comparison against several conventional air supply control methods. The results from the case studies demonstrate that the proposed approach can effectively expedite the system response to occupancy dynamics, thereby minimizing the occurrence of overcooling and overheating, and lowering the occupancy-weighted thermal discomfort level by 73.1 %. The proposed approach holds promise for real-time applications based on digital twin architecture.",
