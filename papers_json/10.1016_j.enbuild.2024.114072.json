Graphical abstract Maintaining high ventilation rates in operating rooms (ORs) is critical to ensure the safety of healthcare professionals and patients. Yet, the significant energy consumption associated with ventilation systems is a growing global concern. While traditional approaches have predominantly focused on optimizing ventilation design, limited attention has been given to operational control strategies. This study aims to control ceiling air supply speed by exposure aerosol concentrations exhaled by the patient. It achieves this by integrating empirical data with machine learning (ML) models, effectively balancing the need for maintaining optimal ventilation conditions and ensuring a safe aerosol exposure concentration. Experimental results from a full-scale OR setup, manipulating ceiling air supply speed, respiratory flow rate, and surgical bed height, generated 81 datasets. These datasets served as the basis for assessing the performance of 11 ML models. Notably, the extra trees (ET) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) models outperformed the others, exhibiting impressive coefficient of determination (R2) values of 0.954 and 0.904, respectively. Moreover, the models were further enhanced by assessing their robustness with Gaussian noise and interval prediction. This study presents a novel approach that holds significant relevance for the practical control of ventilation systems, particularly with regard to health and energy efficiency considerations.

This heightened energy demand is primarily associated with the needs for space heating, cooling, and continuous ventilation in facilities that operate 24/7, coupled with the presence of various medical equipment [2]. Notably, the energy consumed by heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, in conjunction with heating and cooling sources, represents a substantial portion of the total electricity consumption in hospitals [3,4]. Paradoxically, despite being the department with the highest energy consumption in hospital central HVAC systems, there is a lack of comprehensive research into the energy efficiency of operating rooms (ORs), which offer significant potential for improvement [5\u20137]. Given the unique characteristics of ORs, HVAC systems assume a critical role in preserving indoor air quality and sterility, a mission that is of paramount importance in safeguarding the health and well-being of surgeons, healthcare personnel, and patients alike [8]. Notably, respiratory droplets carrying pathogens can be released into the surrounding environment through actions such as patient breathing, coughing, or sneezing. The subsequent transport and dispersion of these droplets through airflow can result in direct inhalation by healthcare practitioners or their deposition onto surfaces, posing significant infection hazards for health worker [9,10]. In this context, ventilation plays a crucial role in reducing particle concentrations and limiting the spread of pollutants, thereby mitigating the dissemination and growth of bacteria and viruses and, consequently, reducing the risk of cross-contamination [11]. To address the aforementioned issues, many researchers have undertaken studies from a design perspective. Several investigations have centered on the impact of pollutant removal from ventilation systems [12,13]. Since the influential study by Charnley et al. [14] emphasized the crucial role of laminar airflow (LAF) systems in reducing particle transmission, hospitals around the world have shifted from traditional mixing systems to adopt LAF systems. Lin et al. used smoke flow visualization and particle image velocimetry (PIV) to enhance LAF ventilation design and found that positioning exhaust ducts on the ceiling prevented the recirculation of airborne contaminants [15]. Agirman et al. employed computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to explore the impact of four exhaust vent locations on airflow and particle distribution, reaching similar conclusions [16]. Several studies have also examined the influence of air supply vent dimensions on aerosol contamination [17\u201319]. However, all of these studies were carried out during the design phase and with a focus on air supply system configuration. There have been relatively fewer studies on the operational aspects of the air supply system. The traditional operating mode primarily relies on open-loop control based on pre-determined airflow rates established during the design phase [20,21]. This ventilation rate is often fine-tuned through repetitive adjustments based on empirical experience. Some studies may use CFD or on-site testing to validate the exposure particle concentration [22\u201324]. Unfortunately, the designed ventilation cannot be changed to meet different needs. In recent years, research has emerged on methods for regulating air supply speed based on temperature, humidity, and carbon dioxide concentration [25\u201327]. Research focusing on aerosol concentration remains limited. Moreover, the advent of cost-effective particle sensing technology has facilitated the detection and quantification of healthcare worker exposure levels under varying conditions [28]. There is a huge potential to save energy by regulating the ventilation rate while keeping the particle concentration low. The rapid evolution of computational technologies has propelled machine learning (ML) models to the forefront as potent data-driven tools; these models are adept at discerning intricate correlations between data features to effectuate predictions or decisions in complex problem domains [29]. As a novel data-driven technology, it has accuracy, efficiency, and generalization characteristics and can explore the implicit correlation between data features [30]. ML does not need to consider actual physical mass transfer or chemical reaction processes, nor does it require complex and time-consuming parameter determination experiments. Hence, predictions are considerably less difficult and costly [31]. Many investigations have unequivocally substantiated the efficacy of ML techniques in forecasting and optimizing indoor environments, thereby furnishing compelling exemplars and promising prospects [32\u201334]. Notable instances include the development of a low-dimensional discrete linear ventilation model-based artificial neural network (ANN) designed to manage ventilation control, striving to achieve health-centric and energy-efficient indoor environments [35]. In the realm of building systems, Chen et al. [36] harnessed a model-independent Q-learning reinforcement learning algorithm to formulate optimal control decisions for HVAC and window systems, yielding energy efficiency gains while mitigating thermal discomfort. This study aimed to integrate experimentation with ML methodologies. An on-site experiment was conducted to analyze the distribution characteristics of exhaled aerosol concentrations at six different locations. These concentrations were influenced by the interplay of ceiling air supply speed, respiratory flow rate, and the surgical bed height. Subsequently, utilizing the experimental data as the dataset, 11 distinct ML models were employed to assess the prediction capabilities of air supply speeds based on concentrations, respiratory flow rate, and the surgical bed height. The findings of this study have implications for effectively controlling and adjusting air supply speeds within ORs. 2 Methods Firstly, we conducted experiments to gather the training datasets. During this phase, we systematically manipulated the three variables: ceiling air supply speed, respiratory flow rate, and surgical bed height, to record concentration data at six distinct locations. Subsequently, we employed ML models to predict the air supply speed based on the exposure particle concentrations, while also comparing the performance when incorporating the respiratory flow rate or surgical bed height as the additional input feature. This section offers a comprehensive account of the experimental methods and the ML models utilized in our study, along with a detailed explanation of the evaluation parameters of the models. 2.1 Experiment section All measurements for this study were performed in the controlled settings of a specialized hospital OR simulation and distribution test chamber laboratory, located at the Baoding Campus of North China Electric Power University [37]. This dedicated facility encompasses dimensions of 7.2 m × 6.3 m × 3 m and is thoughtfully equipped with essential amenities, including a single-arm mechanical operating table, surgical table, and surgical lamp, similar to those found in standard level-one OR settings. At the center of the laboratory, there is a functional bed measuring 1.80 m × 0.60 m × 0.83 m, surrounded by six anatomically accurate human body models designed for surgical personnel training, as depicted in Fig. 1 (a). In the OR, there are a total of 8 air supply vents on the ceiling, with our experiment primarily focusing on the central four vents. These central vents each have dimensions of 1.345 m × 0.623 m. The exhaust vent, equipped with a medium-efficiency filter, is positioned near the air supply diffusers, measuring 0.26 m × 0.26 m. Its primary function is to regulate indoor pressure. Furthermore, four return air grills, each fitted with medium efficiency filters, are symmetrically positioned. Each return air grill has dimensions of 0.9 m × 0.35 m and is located at an approximate height of 0.15 m above the ground. The comprehensive HVAC system in the laboratory follows a standard configuration comprising an air handling unit (AHU) in conjunction with fan filter units (FFUs). Both fresh and return air streams converge into a unified air conditioning unit for centralized treatment. Within this unit, the air undergoes a sequential process involving pre-filters, medium-efficiency filters, high-efficiency air filters, and other air processing components. Subsequently, the treated air traverses a static pressure box and is introduced into the OR through FFUs equipped with high-efficiency filters. Finally, a portion of the air is exhausted through the exhaust vent, while another portion is recirculated into the AHU through return air ducts, as illustrated in Fig. 1(b). Moreover, the OR and the interconnected buffer room are maintained at a negative pressure of − 10 Pa, aligning with the pressure specifications for patient admission in negative-pressure ORs as stipulated in the Architectural technical code for hospital clean operating department (GB50333-2013). An on-site experiment was meticulously designed to investigate the dispersion pattern of patient-derived respiratory particulate concentrations under the distinct influences of varying ceiling air supply speeds. The comprehensive average airflow velocities were determined by adjusting the fan frequency to 60 %, 80 %, and 100 %. Nine measurement points were selected from each air supply vent, as depicted in Fig. 1(c). The air supply speed for each vent was calculated as the mean value of three repeated measurements, and the overall mean velocity employed in the study was determined as the mean value of the air supply velocities from the four vents. The average velocities measured were 0.49 m/s, 0.57 m/s, and 0.66 m/s, respectively. Consequently, the total airflow rates were calculated as 5912.47 m3/h, 6877.77 m3/h, and 7963.73 m3/h, and the resulting air change rates were 43.45 ACH, 50.54 ACH, and 58.52 ACH, respectively. The TSI9565 Vocoidal Multi-Function Ventilation Meter was selected as the instrumentation for measuring air velocities, with a measurement range of 0\u201330 m/s and an accuracy of ± 3 %; the sensor was a hot-wire anemometer [38]. A steady expiratory process was adopted, with the respiratory flow rate maintained at a constant value, a common approach in previous studies [39,40]. According to relevant studies [41,42], the inhalation process has little effect on the spatial distribution of droplet aerosols, so the inhalation process is ignored. Various respiratory flow rates were simulated, including 0.5 m/s, 1.2 m/s, and 1.9 m/s. To replicate the particles exhaled by patients, a solution comprising phosphate-buffered saline and glycerol in a 23:2 ratio was utilized [43]. In order to replicate the complex exhalation processes, a six-hole impact aerosol generator (ZR-C04) was utilized in conjunction with an air pump mechanism [39,44]. By adjusting the air pump, varying exhalation velocities could be attained, and these velocities were measured. Furthermore, recognizing the potential impact of varying surgical bed heights on real-world comfort levels [45], we intentionally manipulated the surgical bed height to encompass three distinct levels: the lowest (0.95 m), a medium setting (1.10 m), and the highest (1.25 m). In addition, stringent measures were implemented to align with the standard conditions of ORs and to mitigate any potential interference with the independent variables. Through the surveillance of temperature and humidity sensors in the return air duct, the temperature was meticulously maintained at 26 °C, and the relative humidity was consistently held at 60 % [46]. This deliberate measure ensures that the conditions are not conducive to bacterial proliferation and safeguards the integrity of the study's independent variables. It's worth noting that we excluded the effect of the surgeon's heat dissipation in the experiment. Surgeons operating on patients with infectious diseases typically wear specialized protective suits, which are gas-tight and equipped with a respirator and a thermostat [47]. The thermostat absorbs the body-generated heat and maintains the temperature inside the suit at 24\u201328 °C, ensuring the surgeon's thermal comfort. In such cases, the heat generated by the surgeon does not dissipate into the OR environment because the ambient temperature inside the OR matches that of the protective suit. The experimental model employed in this study features a cold-body dummy that does not release heat to the air, simulating conditions involving specialized protective clothing. The PGM-300 Kono laser dust particle counter was employed for precise documentation of PM0.3 particle concentrations at six predefined locations, demonstrating an error rate of less than 5 % even at particle counts as high as 2 million particles per cubic foot [37]. Specifically, the particle counter was strategically positioned at a height corresponding to the mouth level of medical personnel, which is approximately 1.65 m above the ground. Prior to the commencement of each formal experiment, a background concentration measurement spanning 5 min was systematically conducted. Subsequently, the particle emitter was activated, releasing particles for a duration of 20 min, during which a stable measurement was recorded. This 20-minute interval was selected to ensure the achievement of a steady-state particle dispersion, a determination confirmed through preliminary trials. Complemented by the manipulation of three key variables, a total of 27 distinct experimental groups (3 ceiling air supply speed × 3 respiratory flow rate × 3 surgical bed height) were executed. To avoid randomness, we performed 3 replications for each group, for a total of 81 experiments. 2.2 Data preprocessing Before model training, it is crucial to normalize the raw data to mitigate the influence of varying scales across different feature sets, facilitating meaningful comparisons [48]. The formula for standard deviation standardization is as follows: (1) x i \u2032 = x i - μ σ where xi and xi' represent the data before and after standardization, respectively, μ is the mean value, σ is the standard deviation. To assess the accuracy of model predictions, this study adopted a randomized experimental design for empirical analysis. The initial dataset was split into separate training and test subsets, maintaining a ratio of 7:3. Furthermore, to mitigate the potential impact of the splitting plan on the results, the splitting was randomly executed 30 times for training and evaluation. 2.3 Model explanation To highlight the subtle differences among these models, the models utilized in this study are grouped into three categories: the linear model and its optimization variant, the decision tree model, and its ensemble algorithms, and two additional nonlinear models\u2014support vector machine (SVM) and multilayer perceptron (MLP). 11 ML models in all were chosen for comparison, and they are all explained below. 2.3.1 Linear model and its optimization variants Linear regression (LR) is the fundamental regression algorithm in the field of ML. Its main goal is to create a prediction function that defines the linear relationship between input values and their corresponding label values [49], as illustrated in Fig. 2 . This prediction function serves as the foundational model for our research efforts. The formulation of the loss function is encapsulated in the following expression: (2) loss = 1 n ∑ i = 1 n y pre - y true 2 Where ypre and ytrue are the predicted and observed values. In the domain of multiple LR, having a surplus of independent variables can inadvertently result in multicollinearity. It's important to note that Ridge and Lasso regression are not designed primarily to improve model performance but rather to address inherent issues [50]. Ridge regression, also known as Tikhonov regularization, enhances the loss function of multiple LR by adding the sum of squares of all parameters, denoted as the L2 norm. This addition acts as the regularization term [34,51], and its mathematical representation is as follows: (3) loss = 1 n ∑ i = 1 n y pre - y true 2 + α ω 2 2 where α is a constant coefficient and needs to be tuned. Lasso utilizes a similar concept but relies on the sum of the absolute values of all parameters, which is known as the L1 norm, to impose a penalty [52]. As a result, the corresponding expression is presented as follows: (4) loss = 1 n ∑ i = 1 n y pre - y true 2 + α ω 1 2 2.3.2 Decision tree regression model and its integrated algorithm The decision tree regression (DTR) algorithm, serving as a weak learner, is a supervised learning technique suitable for regression tasks [53]. Its purpose is to extract simple decision rules from the dataset, which facilitates predictions of output values. These decision rules originate from the paths followed from the root node to the leaf nodes. Consequently, the predicted value corresponds to the mean of response variable values contained within a single leaf node. Due to its hierarchical structure, DTR avoids issues related to correlated features. In cases of high feature correlation, the same result is achieved regardless of the chosen feature for partitioning. The schematic diagram illustrating this principle is displayed in Fig. 3 . Ensemble learning algorithms, specifically bootstrap aggregating (Bagging) and Boosting, have been introduced to tackle the problem of overfitting associated with traditional DTR algorithms [54,55]. Bagging, characterized as a parallel technique, aggregates the independent and uncorrelated individual base model. random forest regression (RFR) is a quintessential example of a Bagging algorithm, which combines multiple DTRs. Each DTR is trained on a distinct subset of data and features, effectively mitigating concerns related to overfitting [56]. The Boosting algorithm integrates the less powerful DTR in a linear form. This iterative process continuously refines the ensemble, effectively reducing bias. Examples include adaptive boosting (Adaboost), gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). Adaboost assigns distinct weights to each sample, refining these weights throughout the iterative sequence, culminating in a final outcome obtained through a weighted majority voting mechanism [57]. GBDT works by progressively improving the performance of the model by continuously fitting the residuals [58]. XGBoost enhances the intricacies of GBDT , incorporating first-order and second-order derivatives to perform second-order Taylor expansions of cost functions as well as regularization terms [59]. It is well-suited for handling sparse data and utilizes a theoretically validated weighted quantile sketch procedure for efficient proposal calculations [60]. 2.3.3 SVM and MLP SVM, a widely used ML method rooted in statistical learning principles, focuses on identifying the optimal hyperplane that accurately separates sample data, maximizing the geometric margin [61], as illustrated in Fig. 4 . When data separation is challenging, the use of a kernel allows for the transformation of the input data space into a nonlinear and higher-dimensional domain. As a result, the algorithm creates a sparse prediction function by selecting a specific subset of training points known as \u201csupport vectors\u201d [62]. Various kernels are available, including linear, non-linear, polynomial, radial basis, and sigmoid functions. The radial basis function (RBF) kernel, in particular, excels at handling overlapping data instances. Similar to a weighted nearest neighbor approach, the RBF kernel has a stronger influence on regression for nearby observations and a weaker influence on more distant ones [63]. MLP is a type of ANN that typically follows a feedforward model. This model efficiently maps multiple input datasets to a single output dataset [64], as depicted in Fig. 4(b). MLPs exhibit a notable ability for nonlinear mapping, characterized by their attributes of high parallelism, adaptability, and substantial fault tolerance. Comprising three distinct layers, its architecture includes the input layer for introducing model inputs, the output layer for producing the outcomes of the trained model, and the hidden layers, which act as intermediaries and can range from zero to multiple layers [65]. Importantly, MLP's connectivity spans all layers, establishing comprehensive interconnections. Each neuron in the upper layer is intricately connected to all neurons in the subsequent layer. These connections are equipped with contextually relevant weights that are continuously adjusted through the iterative training process, minimizing prediction errors, and enhancing prediction accuracy. Hierarchical connections encompass weight attributes, and node functions perform summation and activation functions. 2.4 Evaluation metrics In this study, four metrics have been selected to evaluate the dissimilarity between the actual data and the predictions. These metrics include: (1) Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): (5) RMSE = 1 n ∑ i = 1 n ( y pre - y true ) 2 (2) Mean Absolute Error (MAE): (6) MAE = 1 n ∑ i = 1 n y pre - y true (3) Accuracy (ACC): (7) Accuracy = 1 - y pre - y true F y true F (4) Coefficient of Determination (R2): (8) R 2 = 1 - ∑ i = 1 n ( y pre - y t r u e ) 2 ∑ i = 1 n ( y pre - y ¯ true ) 2 where ypre and ytrue are the predicted and observed values, \u203eytrue is the mean of the observed values. (5) Interval forecasting coverage probability (IFCP) (9) IFCP = 1 n ( ∑ i = 1 n c i ) where ci is a Boolean value, with 0 indicating that the value is outside the prediction interval, and 1 denoting that the value is within the prediction interval. (6) Permutation Importance (PI) (10) P I j = s - 1 K ∑ k K s k , j where PIj is the feature importance score of feature j, s is the performance score of the model on the dataset, and K is the number of iterations. To assess the prediction error, the RMSE and MAE metrics are employed, with a smaller value indicating a more favorable prediction outcome. ACC measures prediction precision, with a larger value indicating improved predictive performance. Additionally, R2 calculates the correlation coefficient, assessing the ability of prediction results to mirror actual data, where a higher value signifies enhanced predictive efficacy [66]. IFCP is used to evaluate the performance of interval prediction, and as IFCP approaches 1, the performance of the interval prediction model improves [37]. PI characterizes the dependence of the model on that particular feature. It is a model inspection technique that measures the contribution of each feature to a fitted model\u2019s statistical performance on a given dataset. This technique is particularly useful for non-linear or opaque estimators, and involves randomly shuffling the values of a single feature and observing the resulting degradation of the model\u2019s score [67]. The principle is that, for the features to be evaluated, the values are randomly permuted and the performance score of the model is calculated using the original performance score minus the permuted data. The greater the value of PI, the greater the input feature will contribute to the model prediction. 3 Results and discussion As shown in Fig. 5 , there are three phases in all 11 modelling approaches to predict the air supply speed: (1) Phase 1 involved using particle concentrations from the six specified locations as input features to predict ceiling air supply speed for all models. The models exhibiting superior predictive efficacy were subsequently identified. (2) In Phase 2, models displaying commendable performance in Phase 1 were retained. In this phase, the input features were augmented by incorporating respiratory flow rate and surgical bed height, enabling the prediction of air supply speed. (3) Transitioning to Phase 3, models with notable performance from Phase 1 were retained. Considering the precision of the instruments, Gaussian noise was introduced to assess the model's robustness, and interval prediction was employed to provide prediction ranges. 3.1 Parameter settings Parameters play a crucial role in ML algorithms, and their fine-tuning is a laborious yet essential endeavor. The parameters associated with ML methods can be categorized into two groups: hyperparameters, which require manual pre-configuration, and model parameters, which are automatically calibrated by the algorithm based on the training dataset. In this study, we primarily employ manual enumeration as the method for hyperparameter selection. To validate the performance, a K-fold cross-validation method with five folds is employed for the test set [68]. For regression models like Ridge and Lasso, which are characterized by having a single hyperparameter with a significant impact on the results, an initial exhaustive search is conducted over a wide range. Subsequently, the search range is progressively narrowed down until the occurrence of a peak in cross-validation, determining the optimal value. Fig. S1 illustrates the cross-validation results for tuning ET parameters. For models such as RFR and XGBoost, which involve multiple hyperparameters with substantial effects on the results, a two-step tuning approach is employed. In the first step, guided by empirical knowledge, the remaining variables are assigned values, leaving only one variable to undergo the aforementioned iterative search process. The optimal value for that variable under the specified conditions is determined, and this process is repeated for the other variables. The hyperparameters obtained in this step are optimal under specific conditions, but their combination may not be globally optimal. Consequently, in the second step, an expansion within a certain range is applied to the values obtained in the first step, and a nested loop is conducted for these several parameters. Within a manually defined set of candidate parameters, an iterative exploration is carried out by traversing all possible combinations, and the parameter combination that exhibits the best performance is determined as the final result. Fig. S2 displays the cross-validation results for tuning RFR parameters. Parameter optimization is executed for each feature combination, and Table 1 presents the optimal hyperparameter combinations for various ML methods. 3.2 Comparative analysis of prediction outcomes 3.2.1 Linear models and the derived algorithms In the context of this forward modeling experiment, the particle count detected at six distinct locations gradually decline with increasing ceiling air supply speed. The specific results of the experiment can be seen in Fig. S1. This decrease can be attributed to the faster movement of air, which facilitates the removal of particles. There is a noticeable linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables, making the experimental data suitable for linear models. However, across the three LR models and 30 distinct dataset partitions, the prediction outcomes for particle concentrations at the six locations yield suboptimal results. The mean RMSE value across the three models exceeds 0.8, while the ACC metric remains below 0.25. Notably, one experimental subgroup even results in a complete failure, as evidenced by an RMSE exceeding 1, as depicted in Fig. 6 . This discrepancy can be attributed to the linear correlation among the independent variables across the six positions, which fosters multicollinearity. Although alleviating this collinearity through regularization parameters improves model performance, this measure remains only a partial remedy, akin a drop in the bucket [69,70]. 3.2.2 Models with based on decision trees The predictive performance of DTR and the ensemble learning algorithms outperforms that of LR models. As a weak learner, DTR exhibits somewhat unsatisfactory overall predictive performance, resulting in an average RMSE of 0.496 over 30 different dataset partitions. Additionally, DTRs are notably sensitive to dataset partitioning, as evidenced by the highest ACC at 1, the lowest ACC at 0.180, and a range spanning 0.82, as illustrated in Fig. 7 . The predictive performance of RFR models, which consist of multiple DTRs, shows improvement, as evidenced by the increase in MAE from 0.194 with individual DTR to 0.259. Furthermore, the influence of dataset partition outcomes is less pronounced, as indicated by an ACC interval spanning 0.463. The most significant advantage of RFR lies in its inherent randomness. This randomness has two aspects: first, randomness in samples, where a specific quantity of samples is drawn randomly from the training set to constitute root node samples for each regression tree; second, randomness in features, which involves the random selection of candidate features when constructing each regression tree, resulting in the selection of the most suitable feature as the splitting node [71\u201373]. The predictive performance of the extra trees (ET) algorithm, which is a variation of the RFR algorithm, has shown remarkable improvement. The R2 value has increased to 0.954, surpassing the enhancement achieved by RFR by an additional 0.197. Importantly, the prediction outcomes over 30 iterations exhibit remarkable convergence, with an ACC interval spanning 0.219, and a mean value closely aligning with the median. This algorithm differs from RFR in two key aspects. Firstly, ET employs the entire training dataset for the construction of each decision tree, ensuring uniform application of training samples across all DTRs. Secondly, while RFR identifies the optimal splitting attribute within a random subset, ET adopts a fully random approach to determine the splitting value, thereby introducing randomness at the branching level [74]. ET emerges as the most proficient model among robust classifiers rooted in decision trees, demonstrating superiority both in terms of evaluation metrics and its adaptability to the dataset. The collective predictive efficacy of boosting algorithms, including Adaboost, GBDT, and XGBoost, lags behind the predictive performance achieved by the Bagging ensemble learning algorithm. Furthermore, these Boosting algorithms show notable sensitivity to dataset partitioning. Adaboost's RMSE is marginally lower than that of ET, at 0.292, constituting a difference of 0.087. Adaboost, however, yields a larger interval span of 0.450. GBDT shows a minor enhancement in predictive performance compared to DTR, with the four-evaluation metrics demonstrating a comparable trend. XGBoost, an evolved variant of GBDT, does not exhibit remarkable adaptability to the experimental dataset. It marginally advances R2 by 0.036 in comparison to GBDT, and although the interval span of ACC shrinks from 0.697 to 0.839, the net effect remains inconsequential. 3.2.3 Comparison between SVM and MLP The predictive outcomes of the nonlinear SVM model exhibit only marginal improvement over those of the linear model, yielding a RMSE of 0.658, even falling short of the predictive results offered by the DTR. While the prediction outcomes across 30 dataset partitions demonstrate relative convergence, characterized by an ACC interval span of 0.177, the average ACC remains modest at 0.346. In contrast, the MLP yields commendable results, boasting an RMSE of 0.267, a 0.062 greater than that of ET. The ACC interval span of MLP, at 0.542, is notably smaller by 0.365 compared to SVM, with the mean value reaching an impressive 0.815. Furthermore, MLP attains a remarkable R2 value of 0.904. As depicted in Fig. 8 , both MLP and SVM essentially translate the problem into a high-dimensional space for regression. However, MLP actively seeks effective mapping methods, while SVM passively executes the mapping once the kernel function is determined and a unique mapping method exists. 3.3 Prediction adding the respiratory flow rate Throughout the surgical procedure, patients manifest diverse breathing patterns, leading to fluctuating respiratory flow rates that impact the spatial dispersion of exhaled particle concentrations. The respiratory flow rate constitutes a pivotal factor influencing the projected particle concentration at the six positions during Phase 1. To heighten the precision of our predictions, we opted for the ET and MLP models, which exhibited superior performance in Phase 1, and incorporated respiratory flow rate as an additional input feature. Illustrated in Fig. 9 , both the accuracy of prediction outcomes and their alignment with the dataset have witnessed enhancement. In the case of the ET model, RMSE has decreased by 0.029, while ACC has ascended by 0.03. For the MLP model, MAE has diminished by 0.102, while R2 has escalated by 0.04. The predictive outcomes across all thirty partitioned datasets have become more tightly clustered. Notably, the ET model achieved an interval span of 0.199, while the MLP model exhibited a narrower interval span of 0.120. Table 2 presents the statistics of predicted values falling within the allowable precision range of experimental measurements, essentially surpassing 0.70, yielding satisfactory results. In addition to the accuracy of the model's predictions, it is also important to understand the extent to which the model's outputs depend on the input features. Fig. 10 highlights the permutation importance of each predictive factor within the ET model, which the results were generated using the \u201cPermutation Importance\u201d package within the widely used open-source machine learning library for Python, \u201cscikit-learn\u201d (sklearn). Remarkably, respiratory flow rate emerged as a factor of even greater importance than the individual significance of particle concentrations at certain positions. This signifies that the inclusion of information regarding a patient's respiratory flow rate can notably enhance the precision of our models. 3.4 Prediction adding the height of the surgical bed Throughout surgical procedures, the patient's respiratory flow rate might exhibit variability, rendering reliance on this variable inadequate for accurate prediction. Conversely, the height of the surgical bed in which the patient is located is largely determined preoperatively and thus stands as a viable predictor. The variation in surgical bed heights serves the purpose of accommodating the diverse needs of patients and the requirements of different surgical types [75,76]. It is essential to create an optimal surgical environment and ensure that medical conditions are favorable. Patients come in different heights and sizes, while surgeons vary in physique, requiring various postures to maintain comfort during their work. Having an appropriate surgical bed height minimizes inconvenience for healthcare professionals and reduces discomfort for patients. Moreover, different surgical procedures may necessitate different bed heights to ensure efficiency and effectiveness. For instance, orthopedic surgery may require a higher working platform [77], while thoracic surgery might demand a lower bed height [78]. In this study, surgical bed height is introduced as a distinct variable in the input features for controlling and adjusting the airflow rate, and its impact is investigated in this section. The incorporation of the surgical bed height as an input feature into the ET and MLP models did not yield significant improvements in results; instead, a slight decrement was observed, as depicted in Fig. 9. Specifically, for the ET model, the introduction of this input feature led to decreases in MASE, MAE, and R2, shifting from 0.205, 0.122, and 0.951 to 0.212, 0.124, and 0.901, respectively. In the case of the MLP model, the introduction of the surgical bed height resulted in decreases of MASE, MAE, and R2 from 0.267, 0.170, and 0.904 to 0.276, 0.156, and 0.901, respectively. This indicates that no appreciable gains were obtained when surgical bed was included to the air speed prediction model while keeping particle concentrations as input features. 3.5 Perturbation analysis and robustness The robustness of the model was tested through perturbation analysis experiments to investigate how the models perform in the presence of noise [31]. The results are shown in Fig. 11 . On the x-axis, you can see the ML models, while the y-axis represents fluctuations in various evaluation metrics, with different colors indicating different standard deviation (σ) values. The heights of the columns represent the average values obtained from five sets of experimental results, and the error bar size is determined by the standard deviation. It's clear from the figure that both the MLP and ET models exhibit minimal variance in metric performance, regardless of the level of noise. This indicates that both the MLP and ET models are robust and capable of handling high-noise scenarios effectively. 3.6 Interval prediction In contrast to deterministic point predictions, interval predictions offer a means to impart valuable insights regarding the predictive range and confidence levels [31]. Uncertainty in observed data arises from various sources, including the accuracy of the equipment and possible outside influences. In the context of this study, two primary instruments were employed: the TSI9565 Vocoidal Multi-Function Ventilation Meter, characterized by an accuracy error of ± 3 %, and a particle counter, which exhibited a 5 % error margin. To establish interval prediction models, the research employed Python's \u201cmapie\u201d package, facilitating the generation of prediction intervals at three distinct significance levels: 0.05, 0.10, and 0.20. Evaluation of these prediction results in relation to the confidence interval (CI) was conducted using the IFCP metric. A theoretically valid interval prediction is established when the coverage probability of the constructed IFCP equals or surpasses the corresponding nominal CI [37]. The results, as presented in Table 3 , confirm the robustness and reliability of the interval prediction analysis. In all experiments, the IFCPs consistently exceed the respective CIs, underscoring the effectiveness of the interval predictions in accounting for the inherent uncertainty in the forecasted values, thereby offering a valuable resource for decision-making processes. 3.7 Energy-saving potential Energy consumption in ORs has long been a major concern, with a key focus on the substantial power requirements of the ventilation systems, particularly the fans in clean ORs [7,79]. Studies have shown that across various cleanroom settings, especially in surgical suites, a significant portion of energy consumption is attributed to fan power [2,80]. The stringent air exchange rates in ORs, driven by factors such as hygiene, necessitate a higher-than-standard ventilation, leading to increased energy demands [6]. This is exacerbated by the absence of accurate methods for calculating ventilation rates, forcing systems to operate at design conditions to meet the requirements of the most challenging scenarios. This study provides operating personnel with a sound basis for adjusting air volume. Taking our FFU system as an example, according to the manufacturer's data, the FFU in the OR employs a five-speed variable frequency technology, allowing dynamic adjustments of the fan speed to meet specific air treatment requirements. The power consumption under an airflow rate of 7963.73 m3/h is 190 W per FFU. Opting for a ventilation rate of 5912.47 m3/h can yield a 36 % reduction in fan power consumption by transitioning from the higher frequency at 7963.73 m3/h to a lower frequency. In addition, considering that numerous national standards stipulate a proportional relationship between the volume of fresh air and the total airflow, and allowing for adjustable fresh air volume, reducing the overall airflow may lead to a decrease in energy consumption for fresh air treatment [6]. This dynamic airflow adjustment not only ensures optimal air treatment during surgeries, maintaining cleanliness standards, but also provides an opportunity for energy conservation. The capability to decrease airflow highlights the adaptability of our newly researched approach to various operational requirements. Therefore, implementing our method of controlling and adjusting airflow can not only improve operational efficiency during surgeries but also support energy-saving initiatives during periods of reduced activity. 4 Limitations Based on the prediction results, it is feasible and potential to use ML methods to predict the air supply speed using particle concentrations as input features. But as a pure black-box model, ML heavily relies on the quality and quantity of data [81]. Insufficient or biased data can lead to suboptimal or biased results. Moreover, the model learns from historical data and cannot handle situations that fall outside the training data range [82]. For scenarios that have never appeared in the dataset, ML models may struggle to make accurate predictions. Furthermore, the dataset utilized in this study was obtained from experiments conducted in a simulated environment of an OR. The measurement instrument utilized in the experiment is characterized by its large measurement range, allowing for versatile applications. However, it is noteworthy that utilizing an instrument with a narrower range may not only contribute to obtaining more detailed and accurate results but also improve the precision and reliability of the predictive outcomes. To simplify the experimental conditions, we limited the influencing factors to only source intensity and height. While the influence of the inhalation process on the concentration of aerosol dispersion can be considered negligible [41,42], it may exert a certain impact on areas in close proximity to the emission source [83]. The primary objective of this study is to validate the accuracy of the method. In subsequent investigations, we will delve into the research using actual respiratory rates. Besides, it is important to acknowledge that there are numerous other factors that can potentially affect the diffusion characteristics of bioaerosols in the OR. For instance, medical equipment, staff positions, and surgical lighting can influence airflow within the operation area [84,85]. Airflow obstruction by these objects can reduce the efficiency of removing contaminant particles. Additionally, heat plumes generated by surgical lights and human bodies can also disrupt the airflow [84,86,87]. Furthermore, dynamic movement of surgical staff can lead to high concentrations of bacteria-carrying particles in critical surgical areas [88,89]. The types of surgery performed can also have a direct effect on the distribution of aerosol concentrations [90]. Therefore, the dataset used in this experiment has limitations and future work will address these variables in our analysis. In addition, enhancing air distribution strategy is another effective approach for energy conservation. Air distribution strategy plays a pivotal role in infection control within the OR. Extensive research has shown that the implementation of LAF systems can significantly reduce particle concentrations in the surgical area, thus mitigating the risk of patient infections [14]. Various types of LAF systems, including ceiling LAF horizontal and mobile LAF systems, have been developed and adopted [91,92]. Moreover, enhancing air treatment efficiency, such as reducing the turbulence of air delivery, is another method to improve control effectiveness and achieve energy conservation [93,94]. Subsequent work will focus on evaluating the impact of different forms of airflow management on our methodology. 5 Conclusions In order to regulate the ceiling air supply speed within the OR, 81 effective experiments were conducted. In these experiments, a three-variable crossover analysis involving ceiling air supply speed, respiratory flow rate, and surgical bed height was performed. This approach facilitated the acquisition of the spatial distribution pattern of particle concentrations across six designated positions. By utilizing the particle concentrations at these specific locations as input parameters, the prediction outcomes generated by 11 distinct ML models were assessed, employing four key performance indicators: RMSE, MAE, ACC, and R2. Subsequently, the ET and MLP models emerged as the chosen candidates, with the incorporation of respiratory flow rate and surgical bed height as additional input features. Furthermore, the inclusion of Gaussian noise was employed to assess the model's robustness and interval forecasting was applied to estimate prediction ranges. The implications of the study can be summarized as follows: (1) Within the context of the analyzed dataset, the predictive efficacy of linear models was notably suboptimal, marked by an average RMSE exceeding 0.8. In the realm of robust learners with decision trees as their foundational weak learners, the ET model emerged as the most proficient in terms of prediction accuracy and adaptability to the dataset, boasting an RMSE of 0.205 and an ACC interval length of 0.221. In comparison, the MLP model outperformed the SVM, registering an RMSE of 0.267. (2) The introduction of respiratory flow rate as an additional input feature led to an enhanced predictive performance for both the ET and MLP models. However, the incorporation of surgical height as an input feature did not yield significant improvements in predictive efficacy. (3) The introduction of noise had minimal impact on the predictive performance of the models. Both the ET and MLP models exhibited notable resilience and anti-interference capabilities, maintaining robustness even under noisy conditions. Interval forecasting also effectively provides prediction ranges, mitigating the influence of testing errors on results. Utilizing experimental methods, particle concentration data can be gathered across different air supply speeds, considering two confounding variables: respiratory flow rate and surgical bed height. This dataset, serving as the training set, holds substantial promise for employing ML models in the regulation of air supply speeds within the OR. This approach not only ensures a clean and controlled environment during the surgical process but also highlights the system's responsiveness to evolving air quality needs, contributing to both energy efficiency and sustained particle control. This outcome serves as a cornerstone, offering valuable insights and guidance for the effective control of enclosed environments, and optimization of energy consumption protocols.

        "dc:description": "Maintaining high ventilation rates in operating rooms (ORs) is critical to ensure the safety of healthcare professionals and patients. Yet, the significant energy consumption associated with ventilation systems is a growing global concern. While traditional approaches have predominantly focused on optimizing ventilation design, limited attention has been given to operational control strategies. This study aims to control ceiling air supply speed by exposure aerosol concentrations exhaled by the patient. It achieves this by integrating empirical data with machine learning (ML) models, effectively balancing the need for maintaining optimal ventilation conditions and ensuring a safe aerosol exposure concentration. Experimental results from a full-scale OR setup, manipulating ceiling air supply speed, respiratory flow rate, and surgical bed height, generated 81 datasets. These datasets served as the basis for assessing the performance of 11 ML models. Notably, the extra trees (ET) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) models outperformed the others, exhibiting impressive coefficient of determination (R2) values of 0.954 and 0.904, respectively. Moreover, the models were further enhanced by assessing their robustness with Gaussian noise and interval prediction. This study presents a novel approach that holds significant relevance for the practical control of ventilation systems, particularly with regard to health and energy efficiency considerations.",
