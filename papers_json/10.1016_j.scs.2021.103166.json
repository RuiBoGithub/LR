Building automation and control are of great importance for maintaining a satisfactory thermal environment. Model-based strategies for building climate control require a large amount of effort to construct and to update the building models to address the uncertainties caused by changes in weather conditions and indoor activities, which make it difficult to be applied in real applications. In this study, to overcome limitations of model-based strategies, a model-free control strategy based on extremum seeking control (ESC) without reliance on building models was proposed for real-time control of thermal environment. A dynamic simulation platform based on ESC and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was developed to investigate the control performance of the ESC scheme. To investigate the effectiveness of the ESC scheme in different indoor thermal environments, the effectiveness of the ESC controller in two different cases including a confined space under mixing convection and an office with displacement ventilation was evaluated, respectively. The ESC controller showed good performance in terms of convergence speed and control accuracy in both cases. This study revealed that the proposed ESC-based control strategy has the potential to effectively control thermal environment in real applications due to its model-free advantage. Keywords Indoor thermal environment Model-free control strategy Extremum seeking control Computational fluid dynamics Thermal environment 1 Introduction Maintaining a satisfactory indoor thermal environment is one of the most important tasks for smart buildings (Costa, Keane, Torrens, & Corry, 2013; Yang & Wang, 2012), because thermal environment plays a critical role in affecting occupants\u2019 health, productivity, and working efficiency (Chenari, Dias Carrilho, & Gameiro da Silva, 2016; Y. Chen, Tong, Zheng, Samuelson, & Norford, 2020; Z. Chen, Jiang, Tong, & Tong, 2021; Park & Chang, 2020). A large number of studies in the past decade have focused on investigating advanced techniques to improve in-building thermal environment, which included both active building control systems and passive cooling systems, such as windcatcher (Abdo & Huynh, 2017; Abdo, Huynh, Braytee, & Taghipour, 2020) and the green wall module (Abdo, Huynh, & Avakian, 2018; Bhamare, Rathod, & Banerjee, 2019). In particular, active control of indoor thermal environment could contribute significantly to the management of buildings without being affected by extreme weather conditions (Gholamzadehmir, Del Pero, Buffa, Fedrizzi, & Aste, 2020). However, a large number of previous studies reported that many buildings were faced with over-cooling/over-heating problems due to improper operation of the building control systems Derrible & Reeder (2015). Increasing attention is paid to developing advanced control strategies for efficient control of indoor thermal environment (Afram & Janabi-Sharifi, 2014; Tong, Cheng, & Tong, 2020; Tong, Li, Westerdahl, & Freeman, 2020; Tong, Miao, Tong, & Lu, 2021; Gholamzadehmir et al., 2020; Shaikh, Nor, Nallagownden, Elamvazuthi, & Ibrahim, 2014). At present, Proportion-Integration-Differentiation (PID) control is one of the most commonly used strategies for real-time control of indoor thermal environment due to its low-demand for computational capacity and ease of use (Durand-Estebe, Le Bot, Mancos, & Arquis, 2013). However, the well-tuned parameter of the PID controller during the controller design process can only be applied to specific operational conditions, and the PID controller might become ineffective when the physical characteristics of the buildings change due to weather variations, indoor activities or building renovation. Recently, model-based control has drawn great attention for real-time control of indoor thermal environment and development of a high-fidelity model by considering factors, such as weather variations and occupant behavior, provides an effective solution to deal with the changes of building physical characteristics and/or building operational conditions (Fratean & Dobra, 2018; Tan & Deng, 2020). However, it is usually difficult to develop a high-fidelity model for precise model-based control due to measurement limitations. In addition, the model-based control strategies might become ineffective due to model errors that result from time-varying uncertainties and disturbances in building systems. Development of an adaptive model based on the online building operational data would contribute to the improvement of the control accuracy for model-based control strategies (Afram, Janabi-Sharifi, Fung, & Raahemifar, 2017). For example, Rouchier et al. (2019) used the Sequential Monte Carlo method for online estimation of the parameters of a resistor-capacitor (RC) model and updated the building energy model with newly measured data. Pan et al. (2020) proposed a dynamic thermal comfort study considering the time-varying thermodynamics of the built environment. Shan et al. (2020) coupled a building energy management system with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to model real-time indoor temperature variations online and to optimize the operation of a large open office space by considering the dynamic interaction between air conditioner and indoor environment. Yang et al. (2019) used a model adaptation scheme to update the parameters in a State-Space model and demonstrated that the adaptive model improved control accuracy significantly due to its capability to recalibrate model parameters during the building operational process. In the review by Gholamzadehmir et al. (2020), control strategies based on adaptive models had significant potential to reduce energy consumption and improving energy efficiency in buildings. Moreover, with the rapid development of machine learning (ML) technology, control with the adaptive ML-based model has gained great popularity due to its high modeling accuracy (Cotrufo, Saloux, Hardy, Candanedo, & Platon, 2020). For example, Yang et al. (2020) updated the building model regularly through a dynamic artificial neural network and found that the indoor thermal comfort was greatly improved by using the controller with adaptive ML-based models. However, the development of an adaptive model-based controller for control of a building's thermal environment requires high computational capacity to update the building model online, and sometimes it is not practical in real applications. To overcome the difficulty of constructing and updating a high-fidelity model for describing building thermal responses in model-based control, model-free strategies have developed rapidly in the past decade (Han et al., 2019). Instead of constructing adaptive building models in model-based control strategies, the model-free control strategy focuses on developing adaptive control laws that adjust to the indoor thermal environment adaptively using real-time measurements (Chen & Lin, 2021). Several studies investigated the effectiveness of model-free strategies for real-time control of indoor thermal environment based on a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm, which operates by learning previous control behaviors ( Chen, Norford, Samuelson, & Malkawi, 2018; Yu & Dexter, 2010; Zhai, Xue, & Chen, 2014). These previous studies demonstrated that the model-free strategies operated efficiently without reliance on the building models. However, model-free strategies, especially RL-based model-free strategies, make control decisions using a large quantity of historical building operational data, and the availability of these data is usually limited. Henze (2013) demonstrated that about 100 months of sensory data were required to train the optimal control laws based on mode-free strategy for a single-zone building. Moreover, it takes a large amount of time to learn an optimal control decision for RL-based model-free control strategies, which may make it impractical to be implemented for real-time control of indoor thermal environment in real applications. Extremum seeking control (ESC) is different from the RL-based model-free control strategy, because it is a model-free control strategy that operates using a dither-demodulation scheme without requiring training data to learn the complex control process (Arnold, Negrete-Pincetic, Sankur, Auslander, & Callaway, 2015; Zhang & Ordóñez, 2011). The ESC strategy does not rely on prior knowledge related to the systems and is able to deal with system disturbances and uncertainties adaptively. The model-free advantage significantly benefits the operation of the ESC strategy in real applications, and the ESC strategy has drawn great attention recently for real-time control of complex nonlinear systems including fuel cell hybrid power systems Bizon (2019), wind-energy conversion systems (Aubrée, Auger, Macé, & Loron, 2016), and subsystems of HVAC, such as chilled water plants (Mu, Li, House, & Salsbury, 2017) and hybrid ground source heat pumps (Hu et al., 2016), etc. These studies demonstrated that the ESC-based model-free strategy has significant application potential for real-time control of complex systems (Ciri, Rotea, & Leonardi, 2017). However, there have been no studies that focused on investigating the application potential of the ESC scheme to control indoor thermal environments. A building system is characterized by highly dynamic and nonlinear features and is subject to time-varying environmental variations due to changes in weather and occupant behavior (Amasyali & El-Gohary, 2021; Zhao & Magoulès, 2012). Traditional model-based strategies for building thermal environment control require a large amount of effort to construct and to update the complex building models accurately based on the online operational data, and the availability of these data is usually limited due to measurement limitations. The ESC strategy has the potential to overcome the modelling challenge in model-based strategies because it operates without reliance on prior knowledge related to buildings. In this study, an ESC-based model-free strategy was proposed for real-time control of indoor thermal environment. The focus of this study was to exploit the model-free advantage of the ESC scheme and to investigate the application potential of the ESC strategy for online control of indoor thermal environment in terms of convergence speed and control accuracy. The major contributions of this study are: 1) development of an ESC-based model-free strategy for real-time control of indoor thermal environment to overcome current major limitations of model-based strategies, 2) filling in the gap of performance evaluation of an ESC-based control strategy for online control of indoor thermal environment, and 3) development of a dynamic simulation platform based on the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and an ESC controller to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. To the best of our knowledge, ESC-based model-free strategy was firstly applied for real-time control of indoor thermal environment. The efficient operation of the ESC-based model-free strategy would benefit building operation in an autonomous and adaptive fashion. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the detailed algorithm for the ESC-based control strategy and describes the building models. In Section 3, the simulation results are presented and discussed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy. The last section presents the conclusions of this study. 2 Methodology 2.1 Research framework In this study, we proposed an ESC-based model-free strategy for online tracking of indoor temperature setpoints. A dynamic simulation platform was developed by integrating CFD and the ESC controller to perform simulation studies. Specifically, the indoor environment was simulated by using transient CFD simulations. The ESC controller took indoor temperature simulated by CFD methods as control feedback and used the supply air temperature as control input (Fig. 1 ). To investigate the application potential of the ESC scheme in different indoor thermal environments, the investigation was conducted in two cases including a confined space under mixing convection and an office with displacement ventilation based on the physical model in Blay (1992) and (Yuan, Chen, Glicksman, Hu, & Yang, 1999). Both cases were simulated based on the CFD-ESC simulation platform to investigate the performance of ESC for real-time control of indoor thermal environment. It should be noted that the CFD simulation here was used to perform simulation studies to describe the indoor thermal environment and to provide indoor temperature feedback as an alternative to sensor measurement in real applications. The operation of ESC did not rely on the building model or the CFD model. In addition, the optimal control input obtained using the ESC controller was validated further by comparing it with the result obtained using a static optimizer. To be specific, steady-state CFD simulations were conducted to establish the relationship between the cost function and the supply air temperature (Xue, Zhai, & Chen, 2013). Then, the optimal supply air temperature that maximized cost function was obtained inversely through the static optimizer (Xue et al., 2013). The optimal supply air temperature that we calculated based on the static optimizer was used to validate the control accuracy of the dynamic ESC controller (Fig. 1). 2.2 Extremum seeking control ESC is a model-free control strategy that operates without reliance on system models (Hsin-Hsiung & Krstic, 2000; Krstić & Wang, 2000). The block diagram for ESC is demonstrated in Figure 2 . ESC seeks to calculate the optimal control input u o p t based on the unknown cost function f , as shown in Eq. (1). (1) u o p t ( t ) = arg min f ( u , t ) u ∈ R In the ESC scheme, a sinusoidal perturbation A sin ( ω t ) was injected into the initial input signal u 0 , which resulted in a sinusoidal output perturbation around the initial output value y 0 , as shown in Eq. (2) (2) y ( t ) = y 0 + f \u2032 · A sin ( ω t ) where A and ω are the amplitude and frequency of the sinusoidal perturbation respectively. f \u2032 is the gradient of the cost function f . Then y H P was obtained by filtering y ( t ) through a high-pass filter D H P to extract the high-frequency oscillating part f \u2032 · A sin ( ω t ) in Eq. (2). The signal y H P was multiplied with the perturbation A sin ( ω t ) to obtain the demodulated signal ζ , as shown in Eq. (3). The ζ increased with an increase in the gradient f \u2032 . (3) ξ = y H P · A s i n ( ω t ) = f \u2032 | D HP | · A 2 · sin ( ω t + φ HP ) · s i n ( ω t ) where | G HP | and φ HP is the amplitude and phase of the high-pass filter D H P , respectively. The signal ξ was integrated and then multiplied with an integrator parameter K , which generated an additional term u ^ to be added in the control input u (Eq. (4)). (4) u = u 0 + u ^ + A s i n ( ω t ) In this study, the ESC controller aimed to find the optimum HVAC temperature to realize online tracking of indoor temperature setpoints. The cost function J is shown in Eq. (5). (5) J = − ∑ ( T i n d o o r − T s e t p o i n t ) 2 where Tindoor is the measured indoor temperature and Tsetpoint is the indoor temperature setpoint. In this study, the effectiveness of the control strategy was evaluated based on the simulation platform by integrating the ESC controller and CFD. Tindoor was provided by CFD simulations as the control feedback. The supply air temperature (TSA ) was used as the control input and was regulated based on the ESC algorithm. 2.3 Building models The investigation was conducted in two different cases based on the physical model in Blay (1992) and Yuan et al., 1999), respectively. The indoor thermal environments in both cases were simulated based on the CFD method. To be specific, the Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations were applied as the governing equations for the modelling the indoor airflow and temperature variations as shown in Eq. (6\u2013(8): (6) ∇ · u = 0 (7) ∂ u ∂ t + ( u · ∇ ) u = γ ∇ 2 u − ∇ p + β g Δ T (8) ∂ T ∂ t + ( u · ∇ ) T = α ∇ 2 T + S T where u , p , and T is the fluid velocity, kinematic pressure, and temperature, respectively. γ , β , and α represents the kinematic viscosity, the thermal expansion coefficient, and the thermal diffusivity respectively. S T is the source term. In addition, the RNG k-ε turbulence model was adopted to simulate the indoor environment in both cases, because RNG k-ε is one of the most validated RANS turbulence models and exhibits good agreement with experimental data for simulation of indoor airflow (Koufi, Younsi, Cherif, & Naji, 2017; Zhai, Zhang, Zhang, & Chen, 2007). In this study, the effectiveness of the turbulence models for the confined space and the office were validated by comparison with the experimental data in Blay (1992) and (Yuan et al., 1999), respectively. 2.3.1 Confined space under mixing convection A mixing convection case in Blay (1992) was used to evaluate the performance of the ESC strategy for control of the indoor temperature in a confined space with floor heating coupled with a mechanical ventilation system. In Blay (1992), the experiment was conducted in a 1.04 × 1.04 × 0.7 m (x × y × z) chamber with an inlet velocity of 0.57 m/s and inlet temperature of 288 K (Fig. 3 ). The floor temperature was 308.5 K. The wall and roof temperatures were 288 K (Table 1 ). The indoor air flow movement was driven under the effect of inertia and buoyancy forces. We compared our CFD simulation results using the RNG k-ε model with the experimental results in Blay (1992) and the simulation results by Zhang et al. (2007) in Fig. 3b, and we validated the effectiveness of our simulation model. 2.3.2 Office with displacement ventilation A displacement ventilation case in (Yuan et al., 1999) was used to evaluate the performance of the model-free strategy in an office (5.16 × 3.65 × 2.43 m) (Fig. 4 ). Air was supplied from a displacement diffuser on the right wall with a supply air velocity of 0.09 m/s ( v x = 0.09 m / s , v y = v z = 0 m / s ) and supply air temperature of 290 K. The air was exhausted through an outlet on the ceiling. There were two occupants, two computers, two tables, two cabinets, and six lamps in the office. Detailed boundary conditions of the office are demonstrated in Table 2 . More information about the office configuration can be found in (Yuan et al., 1999). The thermal environment in the office was simulated using the RNG k-ε model, since RNG k-ε model is one of the most validated RANS turbulence models for simulation of indoor thermal environment (Zhai et al., 2007; Z. Zhang et al., 2007). The computational domain was discretized using hexahedral cells. In addition, a grid convergence study was conducted to determine the number of grids and to address the tradeoff between computing efficiency and accuracy. Coarse grids fail to provide accurate simulation results, while fine grids give accurate simulation results at the cost of long computational time. In this study, the computational domain was discretized into 46,415 (coarse), 193,924 (moderate), and 338,592 (fine) cells to construct grid convergence tests. The simulated temperature profiles along line L3 using the three types of grid patterns were demonstrated in Fig. 4,. The temperature profile simulated using moderate grids was close to the result obtained using the fine grids. Compared with the temperature profile calculated using moderate grids, the simulation results calculated using coarse grids demonstrated a larger deviation from the simulation results calculated using fine grids. Thus, the grid number of 193,924 was used for further simulation based on our grid convergence tests. In addition, to validate the effectiveness of the CFD model, the CFD simulation using RNG k-ε model was compared with the experimental data along five vertical lines (Fig. 5 ) by Yuan et al. (1999). As shown in Fig. 5, the simulation results showed good agreement with the experimental results, which demonstrated the effectiveness of the CFD model. 3 Results In this section, the ESC performance in two different indoor thermal environments including a confined space under mixing convection and an office with displacement ventilation was demonstrated, respectively. The ESC scheme aimed to track indoor temperature setpoints by taking indoor temperature as control feedback and using supply air temperature as control input. The findings in this section will be further discussed to analyze the application potential of ESC scheme for real-time control of indoor thermal environment in real applications. 3.1 Case 1: Confined space under mixing convection Case 1 was conducted in a confined space under mixing ventilation Blay (1992). According to the description by Baly (1992), the indoor environment was mainly affected by mechanical ventilation and floor heating systems. In this study, the supply air temperature was used as control input, while the variation of floor heating temperature was assumed as the external environmental factors that changed the room physical characteristics. The effectiveness of the ESC strategy was evaluated under both fixed and time-varying conditions. It should be noted that to reduce the computational cost and time cost of transient CFD simulations, the indoor thermal environment was simulated based on a simple physical model. However, it should be noted that despite the simplicity of the model, the simulation was able to provide insight into the effectiveness and the application potential of the ESC scheme in practice. The results of this study could be further generated to more complex building conditions with time-varying uncertainties from weather and indoor activities in real applications. 3.1.1 Fixed conditions The ESC performance was first evaluated under the fixed conditions with constant floor temperature of 308.5 K as shown in Table 3 . The aim of the ESC control in this section was to track an indoor temperature setpoint of 295 K. The static map was established in Fig. 6 based on steady-state CFD simulations to demonstrate the physical characteristics of the room. According to Fig. 6, it was estimated that the supply air temperature of 294.45 K was required to maintain the indoor temperature setpoint. It is of great significance to tune ESC parameters, especially integrator parameter K and amplitude of sinusoidal perturbation A , before implementation of the controller. The effects of ESC parameters (i.e., integrator parameter K and amplitude of sinusoidal perturbation A ) on control performance were demonstrated in Fig. 7 . In Fig. 7a-7b, the effect of integrator parameter K on the ESC control performance was investigated by setting the amplitude of sinusoidal perturbation at the fixed value of 0.8. It could be observed that the increase of integrator parameter K from 2 to 4 significantly accelerated the convergence speed. However, temperature overshoot occurred at K = 6 due to the aggressive increase of actuation gradient, which resulted in increase of convergence time instead (Fig. 7b). In addition, the effect of parameter A on ESC performance was investigated in Fig. 7c-7d. Increasing the amplitude of sinusoidal perturbation from 0.4 to 1.2 contributed to significant acceleration of convergence speed, but increase of the amplitude from 0.8 to 1.2 only contributed to slight improvement of convergence speed. Thus, parameter A of 0.8 was selected for design of the ESC controller. It could be concluded that the appropriate ESC parameters were of great significance in determining its control performance. The control performance of ESC controller with well-tuned ESC parameters was demonstrated in Fig. 8 . In Fig. 8, the ESC controller started at t = 0 s. It cost about 900 s for the indoor temperature to converge to a steady-state of approximately 295.01 K (Fig. 8b). Moreover, as shown in Fig. 8a, the supply air temperature finally oscillated at 294.4 K to maintain the desired indoor thermal environment, which exhibited good agreement with the result obtained using static optimizer in Fig. 6. Moreover, the time-varying temperature distributions in the confined space were demonstrated in Fig. 8c-8h. There were no obvious variations in temperature distributions during the first 150 s due to the delayed response of indoor temperature, which could also be observed in Fig. 8b. Then, a gradual increase of indoor temperature from t = 150 s to t = 900 s could be observed in Fig. 8d-8h. The indoor temperature finally stabilized at 295 K at around t = 900 s and actually there had been no huge indoor temperature variations since t = 700 s. It could be inferred that the ESC scheme has good control performance in terms of convergence speed and control accuracy. In comparison with the ESC controller, the performance of conventional rule-based controller (RBC) for controlling indoor thermal environment was investigated, because the rule-based controller is one of the most widely used controllers in practice. Two different RBC control rules (i.e., RBC1 and RBC2) were demonstrated in Fig. 9 . As shown in Fig. 9, RBC2 was unable to reach the indoor temperature setpoint due to the bad design of the control rules. On the other hand, RBC1 was able to reach the indoor temperature setpoint but had difficulty in stabilizing at the optimal value. In addition, the accuracy of the RBC controllers for both RBC1 and RBC2 were obviously lower than the ESC controller. Moreover, a large amount of effort was required to analyze building operational conditions to determine the appropriate control rules for the RBC controller. Thus, it could be concluded that the ESC has significant advantage over the conventional rule-based controller. 3.1.2 Time-varying conditions In this section, the ESC scheme was investigated under time-varying conditions to investigate the robustness and adaptivity of the ESC scheme. The variation of floor heating temperature was assumed as the time-varying environmental factors. Specifically, the ESC method was implemented under the time-varying condition with a step decrease and ramp decrease of floor heating temperature from 308.5 K to 300 K respectively. In this section, the ESC simulation aimed to maintain the desired temperature of 292 K in the center of the room. According to the static map in Fig. 10 , the optimal supply air temperature of 291.52 K and 289.04 K was required to maintain the indoor temperature setpoint of 292 K under conditions with floor temperature of 300 K and 308.5 K, respectively. Fig. 11 demonstrated ESC performance under the time-varying condition with a step decrease of floor temperature. From t = 0 s to t = 800 s, the supply air temperature oscillated around 288.94 K to maintain the desired indoor temperature under the condition with floor temperature of 308.5 K. Then an abrupt decrease of floor temperature from 308.5 K to 300 K occurred at t = 800 s. As shown in Fig. 11, Tindoor decreased from t = 800 s to t = 1100 s and then increased to converge to the steady state of 292.03 K at t = 1600 s, with a relative error smaller than 10−4. The supply air temperature oscillated around 291.50 K under the condition with floor temperature of 300 K, which agreed well with the estimated optimal value of 291.52 K obtained using the static optimizer in Fig. 10. In summary, a total time duration of 800 s was taken for ESC control to adjust to the step change of floor temperature. The results showed that the ESC could efficiently find out the optimal supply air temperature under conditions with abrupt environmental changes. In addition, the adaptivity of ESC was also evaluated under the time-varying condition with a ramp change of floor temperature (Fig. 12 ). The floor temperature begun to decrease from 308.5 K to 300 K with an 850 s ramp at t = 254 s. The indoor temperature experienced slight decrease under the effect of floor temperature variations, as shown in Fig. 12c. The lowest Tindoor of 291.56 K occurred at t = 1132 s, only 0.15% lower than the indoor temperature setpoint of 292 K. The supply air temperature finally oscillated at 291.47 K, with good agreement with the result obtained using the static optimizer in Fig. 10. It could be inferred that ESC performed well in maintaining the desired building thermal environment under conditions with slowly varying environmental changes. 3.2 Case 2:Office with displacement ventilation In Case 2, the effectiveness of the ESC controller was evaluated in an office with displacement ventilation based on the physical model in (Yuan et al., 1999). The indoor thermal environment in this case was characterized of more complex indoor configuration and more complex thermodynamics compared with Case 1. The aim of the ESC control was to track the time-varying temperature setpoints in the point (x = 1.5 m, y = 0.9 m, z = 0.85 m) near desk. The indoor thermal environment was simulated with the supply air velocity of 0.15 m/s and the supply temperature was regulated according to the ESC algorithm. The indoor temperature setpoint was first set at 297 K and then changed to 294 K at t = 850 s to evaluate the ability of ESC controller to track time-varying indoor temperature setpoints. According to the static map in Fig. 13 , the optimal supply air temperature of 295.9 K and 289.5 K was required to track the temperature setpoint of 297 K and 294 K, respectively. The performance of ESC controller was shown in Fig. 14 . Before the start of ESC control, the steady state of indoor thermal environment had been reached with supply air temperature of 290 K. The ESC controller was turned on at time t = 0 s. As shown in Fig. 14, it took about 800 s for ESC control to track the target indoor temperature of 297 K (Fig. 14) with the supply air temperature oscillating around 295.2 K. The variation of indoor temperature distribution during this process was demonstrated in Fig. 15 . As shown in Fig. 15, the indoor temperature gradually increased to track the temperature setpoint, and the temperature difference between the lower part and the upper part of the room decreased gradually due to the weakened temperature stratification effect resulting from increased supply air temperature. Then the indoor temperature setpoint was set to 294 K at t = 1200 s (Fig. 14b). Approximately 600 s were taken to reach the temperature setpoint of 294 K with supply air temperature oscillating around 290.2 K. The optimal control inputs obtained by ESC scheme agreed well with the optimal value calculated based on the static optimizer in Fig. 13. It could be concluded that ESC performs well in tracking the time-varying indoor temperature setpoints with complex thermodynamics. 4 Conclusion In this study, an ESC-based model-free control strategy was proposed for online tracking of indoor temperature setpoints. The focus of this study was to exploit the model-free advantage of the ESC scheme and to investigate the application potential of the ESC strategy in terms of convergence speed and control accuracy. To be specific, the effectiveness of the ESC controller was evaluated in two different cases including a confined space under mixing convection and an office with displacement ventilation, respectively. Our study showed that the ESC controller tracked indoor temperature setpoints with a relative error smaller than 0.1% in both cases. In addition, our study demonstrated that the ESC controller was able to keep tracking indoor temperature setpoints under time-varying conditions with environmental changes, reflecting the great robustness and adaptivity of the ESC scheme. Based on the findings in this study, it could be inferred that the ESC scheme is able to adapt to a wide range of environmental conditions for effective control of indoor thermal environment in real applications due to its model-free advantage. A potential limitation of this study was that the CFD simulations based on the simplified physical model barely reflected the real building system dynamics with time-varying uncertainties and with complex interactions with the HVAC system.. Future study needs to integrate CFD with simulation tools such as EnergyPlus by considering the dynamic intergration between indoor thermal environment and the HVAC system, to investigate ESC control of a building's thermal environment in conditions with more connections to real-world situations and to construct a more detailed evaluation of the ESC scheme. Another limitation of this study was that we focused on investigating the application potential of the ESC strategy for online tracking of indoor temperature setpoints without considering multiple control objectives such as thermal comfort and energy consumption. Further study could combine the ESC strategy with other advanced strategies, such as model predictive control, to address building control with multiple control objectives. This will be the focus of our next study.

        "dc:description": "Building automation and control are of great importance for maintaining a satisfactory thermal environment. Model-based strategies for building climate control require a large amount of effort to construct and to update the building models to address the uncertainties caused by changes in weather conditions and indoor activities, which make it difficult to be applied in real applications. In this study, to overcome limitations of model-based strategies, a model-free control strategy based on extremum seeking control (ESC) without reliance on building models was proposed for real-time control of thermal environment. A dynamic simulation platform based on ESC and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was developed to investigate the control performance of the ESC scheme. To investigate the effectiveness of the ESC scheme in different indoor thermal environments, the effectiveness of the ESC controller in two different cases including a confined space under mixing convection and an office with displacement ventilation was evaluated, respectively. The ESC controller showed good performance in terms of convergence speed and control accuracy in both cases. This study revealed that the proposed ESC-based control strategy has the potential to effectively control thermal environment in real applications due to its model-free advantage.",
