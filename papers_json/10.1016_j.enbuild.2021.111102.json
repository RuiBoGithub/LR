It consists of a model-based predictive control approach that employs a grey-box model built from the building and weather data that predicts the building heat load and indoor temperature. Different from classical optimization approaches where the discretized differential algebraic equations are integrated into the optimization formulation, our model is calibrated using black-box multiobjective optimization, which allows for decoupling the predictive model from the optimization problem, thus having more flexibility and reducing the total computational time. Moreover, rather than requiring the angle of solar radiation, solar orientation and solar masks to calculate the radiation data, our approach requires only a simple model of the solar irradiance. The calibrated model is then used by heating and cooling optimization strategies that aim at reducing the energy consumption of the building in the next day while satisfying the indoor thermal constraints. The proposed approach was applied in a case study of a commercial building during heating and cooling seasons and the results show that it was able to yield up to 12% of energy savings while having a mean power forecast error of 8%. Keywords Optimal control Grey-box model Energy efficiency Black-box optimization Heating and cooling 1 Introduction In this work, an energy conservation measure (ECM) that optimizes the planning of heating and cooling systems for tertiary sector buildings (e.g. offices, schools, hospitals) is proposed. The proposed optimization strategies are part of the tool BatIntel developed by Veolia Research and Innovation (VERI) and they apply for buildings with intermittent heating or cooling management. In general, the comfort set-point temperature in a building must be maintained only when the building is occupied, in which case the system is said to be in comfort mode. In the remaining time, heating and cooling systems are in setback mode. The building operators take into account a time margin when switching from setback mode to comfort mode in order to ensure the thermal comfort for the arrival of the first occupants in the building. The switch is done at a fixed time following a schedule which is not always adjusted by the building operators. This simple and conservative way to manage the building is not efficient because the thermal needs of the building differ from one day to another and depend upon many variables, such as the weather conditions and distinct occupancy and ventilation operation schedule profiles for each day. The objective of the BatIntel optimization strategies is to achieve the maximum energy savings potential for a given building while satisfying the desired indoor thermal comfort constraint. These optimization strategies do not modify the regulation mode in place; rather, they send optimized set-points to the building management system (BMS) in order to reduce the energy consumption. These strategies rely on a building model that predicts the heat load profile and indoor temperature for the next day. This model is a grey-box R6C2 model derived from the one proposed by Berthou et al. [5] and it is built from the building data history and from weather condition data, as explained in due course. The choice of the R6C2 model as the building model comes from the fact that it compares favorably with others RC models as well as other physical and statistical models [5]. Although a R6C2 model is employed, our calibration procedure as well as the sunlight modelling differs substantially from theirs. A full review of supervisory and optimal control techniques for building HVAC systems is done by Wang and Ma [39] and Foucquier et al. [14]. In particular, model-based predictive control (MPC) has been proved to be a successful method for building climate control and for obtaining energy savings (see [28,22,9,32,26]). Its greatest strengths relies on the fact that it takes into account not only the current timeslot to be optimized but all subsequent ones within a time interval while satisfying a set of constraints. It is also worthy to mention that, with the recent advances in the domain of artificial intelligence, many recent approaches proposed for HVAC optimal control involve the use of machine learning and deep learning models [18] as these type of models have shown a great potential for building energy modelling [36]. In particular, Smarra et al. [37] compares a data-driven predictive control (DPC) method using random forests and regression trees against a MPC approach using a physical model. The authors show in their tests that the optimal control strategies proposed by both approaches are very similar. Moreover, they argument that the DPC method scales better to buildings with more complex dynamics than the traditional MPC method, although the former suffers from model overfitting and from the heavy dependency on data availability. Another DPC method using machine learning models is proposed by Wang et al. [38], where the authors achieved control performance that is similar to that of a grey-box MPC approach. In the research work by Zhang et al. [41], the authors proposed a deep reinforcement learning model coupled with a building energy model and obtained 15% of heating energy savings in a case study where their framework controls the supply water temperature of the radiant heating system of an office building. However, their method has not been tested in a real building and its robustness has not been verified. Other MPC approaches that employ artificial neural networks can be found in the review by Afram et al. [2] and in the papers by Lee et al. [19], Reynolds et al. [31], Nasruddin et al. [25], Chaudhuri et al. [8], Zou et al. [43], Chen et al. [10], Kathirgamanathan et al. [17]. In particular, Chen et al. [10] handled the data availability problem by using transfer learning, a well-known technique in deep learning that allows for building models with relative few data by using pre-trained models parameters. Contributions. Our approach for building thermal comfort belongs to the MPC category and builds on the results from [5] and [28] for calculating optimal solutions for the control variables. Different from other classical approaches that rely on gradient-based algorithms for solving the underlying optimization problems that integrate the discretized differential algebraic equations, this work makes use of continuous black-box optimization algorithms which considerably reduces the computational time needed to obtain a good solution when compared to other methods containing both discrete and continuous variables in the formulation and where more complex techniques such as mixed-integer nonlinear programming are applied. Moreover, the proposed approach is easily applicable to both heating and cooling systems and requires only a simple model of the solar radiation to work well, which differs from standard approaches that make use of the angle of solar radiation, solar orientation and solar masks. Finally, it was tested on a real building during both summer and winter seasons and the results revealed the effectiveness of our approach. Organization. The outline of the paper is as follows. In Section 2, the building model is presented followed by a discussion about its calibration and the prediction accuracy criteria considered. Section 3 introduces the cooling and heating optimization strategies as well as the mathematical formulation that describes the optimization problem involved. In addition, a description of our methodology for evaluating the potential energy savings is given. The complete approach proposed by this paper is summarized in Section 4 through a flowchart that describes the whole process. The case study in the experimental results for both the cooling and heating cases is detailed in Section 5. Conclusions are given in Section 6. 2 Building modelling 2.1 Description of the model The thermal modeling of the building is based on the equivalence between the thermal and electrical networks. This electrical-thermal analogy is shown in Table 1 . It employs a resistance-capacity (RC) model composed of six thermal resistances representing the different forms of thermal losses (conduction and convection) and two capacities representing the thermal storage in the building. The RC model, which will be referred to as the BatIntel model in this paper, is a data-driven deterministic grey-box model whose parameters \u2013 resistances and capacities \u2013 are calibrated by an optimization algorithm. After the calibration is done, this model is used to predict the building indoor temperature and thermal power. The inputs and outputs of the BatIntel model are described in detail in Table 2 while its RC parameters are shown in Table 3 . As mentioned earlier, this RC model with 6 capacities and 2 resistances is inspired by the one proposed by Berthou et al. [5] following the good performance obtained in their tests when compared to other approaches. The corresponding electric circuit is illustrated in Fig. 1 . The Source 1 represents the internal convective gain (W) and it is defined by (1) Source 1 = ( 1 - a ) · g · OCC ( t ) + P ( t ) , P min ⩽ P ( t ) ⩽ P max , where a is the radiative ratio of internal gains, g is the maximum heat gain due to occupancy, P ( t ) is the thermal power at time t , P min is the minimum thermal power, P max is the maximum thermal power and OCC ( t ) is the occupancy ratio that equals 1 when the building is occupied or 0 otherwise. The Source 2 denotes the internal radiative gain (W), being defined by (2) Source 2 = a · g · OCC ( t ) . Finally, the Source 3 indicates the external radiative gain (W) that is defined by (3) Source 3 = Φ ext ( t ) , where Φ ext ( t ) is the solar flux on outdoor walls. The T i node represents the mean indoor temperature while the T m node denotes the temperature of the center of the wall of the building. The two other nodes are the outdoor surface wall node, T h , and the indoor surface wall, T s . The BatIntel model is then expressed by the following differential\u2013algebraic equations (DAEs), which are solved by a Runge\u2013Kutta method: (4a) T h ( t ) ( R m + R e ) R m R e = T m ( t ) R m + T e ( t ) R e + α · Φ ext ( t ) (4b) T s ( t ) ( R i + R s ) R i R s = T i ( t ) R i + T m ( t ) R s + a · g · OCC ( t ) (4c) ( 1 - a ) · g · OCC ( t ) + P ( t ) = C i · ( T set - point - T i ( t ) ) dt + ( T i ( t ) - T s ( t ) ) R i + ( T i ( t ) - T e ( t ) ) R f + VEN ( t ) · ( T i ( t ) - T e ( t ) ) R v (4d) P ( t ) = max ( min ( P ( t ) , P max ) , P min ) (4e) C i dT i ( t ) dt = ( T s ( t ) - T i ( t ) ) R i + ( T e ( t ) - T i ( t ) ) R v + ( T e ( t ) - T i ( t ) ) R f + ( 1 - a ) · g · OCC ( t ) + P ( t ) (4f) C m dT m ( t ) dt = ( T h ( t ) - T m ( t ) ) R m + ( T s ( t ) - T m ( t ) ) R s where T set - point is a set-point temperature defined a priori that varies from day time to night time, VEN t represents the ventilation airflow schedule of the building with values equal to 0 or 1 and P ( t ) is the thermal power estimation which is bounded by thresholds that depend on the building system specifications. Note that the sign of the terms involving the temperatures and the thermal power depend on the heat flow direction, which is the opposite during the cooling season. The Eq. (4c) is a thermal balance between the thermal losses of the indoor air and the heat gains. The thermal heat losses of the indoor air are influenced by the interior convective resistance ( R i ), the infiltration and glazing equivalent resistance ( R f ) and the mechanical ventilation equivalent resistance ( R v ). The other terms of the equation are the radiative gains generated by the building occupancy (e.g., occupants, lighting system, miscellaneous electric equipment) ( 1 - a ) · g · OCC ( t ) and P ( t ) , the heat power generated by the building thermal production (e.g., boilers, chillers, heat pumps). The solar irradiance is expressed in the model in Watts per square meter ( W / m 2 ) and it quantifies the power per unit of horizontal area of solar radiation provided as input data. Our sunlight approach is therefore less complex than the one presented by Berthou et al. [5], where they make use of the angle of solar radiation and the solar orientation as well as solar masks to calculate the radiation data for each building. Nevertheless, our approach has the advantage that it allows to work with easily available meteorological data. It is important to note that the model used here can represent only one thermal zone, thus assuming that all areas of the building are cooled or heated in the same way. One of the next steps for improving the current research work is to extend this model to handle multiple thermal zones and benefit from the optimization framework already built. 2.2 Model calibration The calibration of the model consists in identifying the values of the internal parameters described in Table 3 that minimize the difference between the forecast values and the actual values of power and indoor temperature using a historical data set of four weeks. The number of weeks was chosen after verifying that no significant accuracy improvement came from increasing the number of days and that the optimal value found approached four weeks in our experiments. Fig. 2 illustrates the calibration procedure through diagrams where a new set of RC parameters is proposed every iteration until the convergence criteria are satisfied. The optimization variables in the calibration procedure, also known as control variables in the field of optimal control, are the parameters described in Table 3, whereas the objective functions to be minimized are: \u2022 f 1 : the difference between forecast and actual indoor temperature values; \u2022 f 2 : the difference between forecast and actual thermal power values. Due to the fact that both the power and the indoor temperature indicators ( f 1 and f 2 ) are taken into account in the evaluation of the quality of the model, the calibration procedure can be seen as a problem of multiobjective optimization [24,11]. In this type of problem, it is rare to find a single solution that optimizes each of the objectives simultaneously. Instead, one seeks to identify a list of solutions, called Pareto solutions, that can not be improved without one of the objective functions being degraded. The set of all of these solutions is called Pareto frontier. The first objective function is defined with the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) measure for evaluating the prediction accuracy for the indoor temperature. This measure represents the relative error in indoor temperature and is defined as follows: (5) f 1 ( σ ) = 100 n ∑ t = 1 n T \u203e t ( σ ) - T t T t , where σ is the vector of control variables, T t is the actual value at instant t , T \u203e t ( σ ) is the forecast value at instant t for a given σ and n is the total number of fitted points. Note that T \u203e t ( σ ) is calculated by Eq. (4e) and that all forecast values in this paper are overscored while the actual values are not. The only exception is in the definition of the DAEs in Eqs. (4f), in which case, since there are no actual power and indoor temperature values involved therein, the forecast variables are not overscored for the sake of simplicity. The second objective function represents the absolute error in power and is defined by the median of the absolute deviation between the forecast and the actual values in power over time: (6) f 2 ( σ ) = median t { | P \u203e t ( σ ) - P t | } , where P t is the actual value at instant t and P \u203e t ( σ ) is the forecast value at instant t for a given σ calculated by Eq. (4d). The median was chosen among the statistical measures for calculating the error in power because it is less sensitive to outliers than the mean and because it mitigates the impact of noise present in signals, which is the case with the power data in our case study. Furthermore, the result of P \u203e t ( σ ) - P t is not divided by P t as it is done in (5), because the power values can be close or equal to zero. For this reason, the normalization is done afterwards using a min\u2013max approach as explained in the next subsection. The multiobjective optimization problem of the calibration process is then expressed as (7) minimize σ ( f 1 ( σ ) , f 2 ( σ ) ) subjectto l ⩽ σ ⩽ u , where l and u are lower bounds and upper bounds for each entry of σ , respectively. This problem is actually a dynamic multiobjective optimization problem involving DAEs, which is addressed by coupling a DAE solver with a multiobjective optimization algorithm. Our approach differs from the \u201call-at-once\u201d method where the discretized DAEs are incorporated into the optimization formulation (see [6, Chapters 9 and 10 for more details about both approaches]). Moreover, the proposed approach does not employ a derivative-based nonlinear programming (NLP) method to solve the optimization problem, but rather a black-box optimization method. By doing this, the BatIntel model and the optimization problem are decoupled, which allows more flexibility when one of them must be changed in the future. Besides, this approach avoids the difficulties related to the derivatives of the functions such as their existence and smoothness, which are often required in the convergence theory of many optimization algorithms, and it also reduces the chances of getting stuck on local optima in early iterations as most of the derivative-based NLP solvers are designed to find local optima only. In order to solve (7), the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) [12] has been applied. A genetic algorithm is a meta-heuristic inspired by the theory of evolution by natural selection and whose process is based on mutation, crossover and selection of the iterates to produce better solutions. In addition to these three operations, the NSGA-II has two multi-objective operators that allows to build the Pareto frontier: \u2022 Fast non-dominated sorting: the population is sorted and partitioned into different non-domination levels; \u2022 Crowding distance: a ranking mechanism used in the selection phase to preserve solution diversity. The choice of NSGA-II in the calibration procedure is twofold: (1) it compares favorably with other multi-objective algorithms on many academic and engineering applications [12,13,42,7,27,3,40,16], having been applied in a wide range of real-life applications, and (2) it is easily applicable when the functions are the result of a simulation process. Since one single parameter solution must be chosen in the end to proceed to the optimization strategy, the best compromise solution between the two objectives is considered. In order to achieve this goal, the TOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) [15] multicriteria method was implemented. This method chooses the solution that is the closest to the ideal positive solution and the farthest from the ideal negative solution, after normalizing the scores for each objective function and after computing the geometric distances between Pareto solutions and ideal solutions. 2.3 Prediction accuracy criteria After the calibration is done and a Pareto solution σ ̂ has been selected, the following three accuracy criteria must be satisfied by the resulting model in order to use it in the BatIntel optimization strategy: 1. Median absolute error in indoor temperature < TEMP error absolute , 2. Relative error in indoor temperature T error < TEMP error relative , 3. Relative error in power consumption P error < POWER error relative , where (8) T error ( σ ̂ ) = f 1 ( σ ̂ ) , P error ( σ ̂ ) = f 2 ( σ ̂ ) P max - P min , P max and P min are the maximum and minimum actual power values, respectively, and TEMP error absolute , TEMP error relative and POWER error relative are constants whose values in our case study are 1°C, 5% and 12%, respectively. 3 The BatIntel optimization strategy 3.1 General description The BatIntel optimization strategy aims at reducing the energy consumption (cooling and heating) of the building while satisfying the comfort requirement for the indoor temperature. The three decision variables (only two for cooling) involved and their description are detailed below: 1. Day initial time: switch over from night set-point to comfort (day) set-point; 2. Night set-point indoor temperature: set-point indoor temperature to be attained in the building during night time; 3. Night initial time: switch over from day set-point to night set-point. Depending on the local weather, the night set-point temperature might not be as important for the cooling strategy as it is for the heating strategy as it may not be necessary to cool the building during the night in order to attain the comfort temperature in the beginning of the day. This event was observed in the case study of the building in Brussels described in Section 5, and for that reason the night set-point temperature was not considered as variable for the cooling strategy in that case. This kind of event occurs, for instance, when the external temperature during the night is below 20°C, thus being already below the comfort temperature required. Since there is no occupancy in the building before 7AM, the indoor temperature will not increase and, therefore, there is no need for cooling the building during night time. 3.2 Mathematical formulation of the problem The formulation of the associated optimization problem is described as follows. The objective function consists in minimizing the total energy consumption predicted by the BatIntel model for the next day, which is calculated by the sum of power predictions at discrete times with 15-min intervals. Since the sample interval is constant, it serves only as a scaling parameter for the sum of power predictions in the objective function; therefore, we can dispose of it as the optimization results will not be affected. As for the constraint related to the comfort temperature, the latter is required to be an upper bound for the indoor temperature in the cooling strategy and a lower bound in the heating strategy within a time interval ranging from t beg comf to t end comf . The optimization problem for the cooling strategy is then formulated as (9) minimize θ f ( θ ) subject to g ( θ ) ⩽ 0 , l ⩽ θ ⩽ u , where (10) f θ = ∑ t P \u203e t θ , g θ = max t = t beg comf , \u2026 , t e n d comf T \u203e t θ - T comf , θ is the vector containing the three decision variables described in Section 3.1, l and u are lower bounds and upper bounds on each entry of θ , respectively, P \u203e t ( θ ) and T \u203e t ( θ ) are the power and the indoor temperature at instant t predicted by the BatIntel model, respectively, and T comf is the comfort set-point temperature defined a priori. The only difference of this formulation from the one used in the heating strategy is the inequality sign in the constraint related to g ( θ ) in (9), in which case it is flipped. In (9), it is demanded that the forecast indoor temperatures, T \u203e t ( θ ) , be lower than or equal to the comfort set-point temperature, T comf , within the time interval from t beg comf to t end comf . Rather than having one constraint per instant t to express this comfort requirement, the maximum value of T \u203e t ( θ ) - T comf from all t is considered. If it is strictly positive, it means that T \u203e t ( θ ) > T comf for at least one instant t, which implies that the comfort requirement is not satisfied in the predefined time interval. Otherwise, if the constraint in (9) is satisfied for the maximum value of T \u203e t ( θ ) - T comf , then T \u203e t ( θ ) ⩽ T comf for every instant t. By using the max function for modelling the comfort requirement, the number of constraints in the problem is considerably reduced. For instance, assuming that t beg comf = 8AM and t end comf = 8 PM, as in our case study, rather than having 180 (the number of 15-min intervals from 8AM to 8PM) constraints, the problem ends up with one single constraint, which is much simpler. This is of great importance as a large number of constraints usually increases the computational time and makes the problem more difficult to be solved by most of the optimization algorithms. On the other hand, the fact that the max function is not differentiable could make the problem more difficult to be solved by optimization algorithms that require smoothness of the functions. However, our approach uses an optimization algorithm that neither requires the derivatives of the functions nor their smoothness as the functions are considered black boxes. It belongs to the category of black-box optimization methods called \u201cdirect search\u201d. Direct-search methods are iterative methods that do not require the analytic expressions of the functions or derivatives, but only the function values. These methods are based on comparing the values of the functions at several points in a mesh at each iteration. If the algorithm finds a new point in the mesh that improves the objective function (total energy consumed in the day, for example) with respect to the current point, the new point becomes the current point in the next iteration of the algorithm. In general, a direct-search method has two steps, called search and poll. The search step allows the user to use any information about the functions, if available, in order to generate a finite set of trial points in the mesh. For instance, this can be done through the use of interpolating models. If the search step fails to obtain a new point that is better than the current iterate, the poll step evaluates the functions at a set of new points defined by a set of well-defined directions and a step size parameter. If no point with lower function value is found, the step size is reduced and a new iteration begins. Fig. 3 gives a graphical representation of a direct-search method where the coordinate directions define the pattern used in the poll step. Among the existing techniques in the class of direct-search methods, the mesh adaptive direct search methods (MADS) [4] proved to be very efficient in practice and one of the appealing features in contrast to other derivative-free algorithms is the existence of a supporting convergence theory. In MADS, the set of trial points considered during the poll step is called a frame. At iteration k, the MADS frame is defined to be the set (11) P k = x k + Δ k m d : d ∈ D k , where Δ k m is the mesh size parameter defining the mesh resolution and D k is a positive spanning set of directions. In order to give a definition of a positive spanning set, let us recall the concept of positive span first. Definition 1 The positive span of a set of vectors v 1 , v 2 , \u2026 , v r ⊂ R n is the convex cone generated by this set, i.e., (12) v ∈ R n : v = α 1 v 1 + ⋯ + α r v r , α i ⩾ 0 , i = 1 , \u2026 , r . A set of vectors D in R n is said to be a positive spanning set if its positive span is R n . The motivation behind the use of a spanning set D ⊂ R n is that it guarantees that, for any given vector v in R n , there is at least one vector d in D such that v and d form an acute angle. In particular, this holds when v = - ∇ f ( x ) (i.e., v is the negative gradient of f at a given point x), which implies that d is a descent direction. The distance between a trial point x k + Δ k m d in P k and the frame center x k is bounded above by the poll size parameter Δ k p . The parameters Δ k m and Δ k p may be increased or decreased at the end of each iteration based on the success of the latter to obtain a trial point that is better than the frame center x k . A popular solver that implements the MADS algorithm and that was chosen in our experiments is NOMAD [1]. Other black-box optimization methods that make use of surrogate models to replace the black-box functions during the optimization process (see [34,35,33,29,30,20,21]) are also commonly used in real-life applications and could be applied to solve the problem (9). A comparative study of the performance of different black-box algorithms on (9) is left for future research work. Notice that the problem (9) is also a dynamic optimization problem involving DAEs and that is solved by coupling a DAE solver with a black-box optimization algorithm in a way similar to what it has been done in the calibration process. In order to obtain the best available solution, the Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) [23] is used as a multistart method for generating the starting points of many optimization runs. LHS is a statistical sampling approach widely used for design of experiments that allows to construct samples from a probability distribution while ensuring that the search space is well covered. 3.3 Performance criteria In order to evaluate the performance of the BatIntel optimization strategy, the energy consumption reduction obtained on each day of the test period is calculated. Then, the mean over these days is considered. For this purpose, the energy consumed after the application of the optimized set-points proposed by BatIntel (i.e., actual optimized energy) is compared to the energy that would be consumed in the absence of optimization on the same day when applying the typical set-points used in the building. However, one can not have the actual data of the two power curves over the same period since the application of the optimized set-points prevents the existence of the other. Therefore, the \u2018non-optimized energy\u2019 is simulated by the BatIntel model (forecast non-optimized energy) and its value is used in the calculation of the savings. Assuming that the power value is constant within the uniform time intervals Δ t , the formula for estimating the energy consumption reduction, or simply, the energy savings (ES) for one single day is then defined as (13) ES = E \u203e non - opt - E opt E \u203e non - opt = Δ t ∑ t = t beg savings t end savings P \u203e t - P t Δ t ∑ t = t beg savings t end savings P \u203e t = ∑ t = t beg savings t end savings P \u203e t - P t ∑ t = t beg savings t end savings P \u203e t , where E \u203e non - opt is the forecast non-optimized energy consumed during the day, which is the time integral of the forecast non-optimized power, and E opt is the actual optimized energy consumed during the day, being the time integral of the actual optimized power. The savings is calculated by taking the time interval ranging from t beg savings to t end savings , whose values used in the experiments are t beg savings = 7 PM and t end savings = 10 PM for the cooling season and t beg savings = 4 AM and t end savings = 8 PM for the heating season. The reason for having a small time range for the cooling season in our case study is explained in Section 5.2.2. 4 The complete approach The approach proposed in this paper for optimizing the planning of heating and cooling systems for tertiary sector buildings can now be summarized. Fig. 4 shows the inputs and outputs of both calibration and optimization phases as well as the interaction between both. The static inputs and dynamic inputs for the R6C2 model calibration are given in Table 2. For the calibration phase, a total of 4 weeks of historical data are used as dynamic inputs. The calibration procedure is then applied by running the bound-constrained multiobjective optimization solver NSGA-II with the objective functions described in Section 2.2. As discussed in Section 2.3, the calibration performance indicators are the median absolute error in indoor temperature, the relative error in indoor temperature and the relative error in power consumption. If the calibration performance satisfy the conditions stated in Section 2.3, the model is used in the optimization strategy for the planning of heating and cooling systems described in Section 3. Otherwise, it awaits one week in order to collect new data for a new calibration attempt. If 4 consecutive calibration attempts fail, no optimization is done and the BMS default setpoints are implemented instead. As for the optimization phase, first the user set the desired strategy, which can be heating or cooling. Then, the constrained single-objective optimization solver NOMAD is run with the dynamic inputs shown in Table 2 to solve the optimization problem formulated in Section 3.2. Different from the calibration phase, only 4 historical days are used as dynamic inputs. 5 Case study 5.1 About the building and the data The BatIntel model is intended to medium- and high-energy buildings and it needs historical data of the building operation. It is a monozone model and thus it requires a control level of the heating and cooling systems on a global scale of the building. Learning of these requirements, our approach was tested on a real building located in Brussels, hereafter denoted as the BatIntel building for the sake of confidentiality, that has significant heating and cooling consumption. This demonstrator building is monitored, which allows to have the required data, and equipped with a Building Management System (BMS) that enables the automatic regulation of the heating and the cooling systems. The general characteristics of the building are given in Table 4 . In practice, from a thermal viewpoint, the building can behave as multi-zone in mid-season, having some zones with different thermal demands or some zones being heated and others being cooled. However, the results in this paper are based on experiments made only during winter, where 100% of the building zones are heated, and summer, where 100% of the zones are cooled. The calibration results that are shown next prove the efficiency of the model, thereby validating the mono-zone thermal behaviour assumption for this building during both seasons. With respect to the NSGA-II parameters in the tests, the population size used was of 80 while the number of generations was 150. The initial population was randomly sampled based on a combination of the building characteristics (e.g., surface area, windows type, inertia type, occupancy, levels height, ventilation) and expert knowledge. Numerical results for cooling and heating seasons are presented in what follows. The experiments were conducted during the summer of 2017 and the winter of 2017\u20132018. The model calibrations were done with historical data of indoor temperature and thermal power of 28 days and at a 15-min time interval. The measured and the forecast external temperature and solar irradiance data came from the Royal Meteorological Institute of Belgium (IRM) and were at a one-hour time interval, being then linearly interpolated to be at the same 15-min time interval of the building measured data. Since the model was re-calibrated every week with new data in order to improve its prediction accuracy, only the results of one calibration for heating and one for cooling are shown here. For both seasons, the time interval where the comfort-related constraint in the problem (9) must be satisfied ranges from t beg comf = 8 AM to t end comf = 8 PM . In the heating case, T comf = 23 ° C, and, in the cooling one, T comf = 24 ° C. Finally, the occupancy ratio in the experiments was set to 0.5 from 7AM to 8AM and from 7PM and 8PM, whereas it was set to 1 from 8AM to 7PM. 5.2 Cooling season 5.2.1 Calibration results The calibration discussed below was done with the data described in Table 2 obtained from 03/08/2017 to 30/08/2017. As it can be seen in Fig. 5 , the NSGA-II solver has found not only one optimal set of RC parameters but a list of Pareto solutions. The best compromise solution, σ ̂ , is the one in red whose power absolute error ( f 2 ( σ ̂ )) equals 150,628 kW with relative error ( P error ) of 5.06% and whose MAPE value for indoor temperature ( f 1 ( σ ̂ )) is 1.25% with median deviation of 0.23°C. This solution is situated in the \u201cknee\u201d of the approximate Pareto frontier, where a small change in its position causes a large change in at least one of the objectives. The RC parameters values associated to this solution are given in Table 5 , which also presents the lower and upper bounds for each parameter based on expert knowledge. The building ventilation system was not operated during the cooling season tests, hence the absence of the associated resistance parameter R v . The thermal power and indoor temperature curves associated to the best compromise solution obtained from the calibration data are shown in Figs. 6 and 7 , respectively. As it can be seen, the forecast curves are relatively close to the actual ones, which proves that the model not only captures well the dynamics of both indoor temperature and power consumption, but it is also precise regarding the magnitude of the actual values using only 3 weeks of historical data. The thermal power and indoor temperature curves obtained from the model on one-week unseen historical data (i.e. data not used in the calibration phase) are shown in Figs. 8 and 9 . In both figures, it is noticeable that the forecast curves are also close to the actual ones, which demonstrates the good prediction properties of the calibrated model. 5.2.2 Optimization strategy results In the cooling strategy, there are two decision variables in principle: 1. Day initial time: switch over from night set-point to comfort (day) set-point; 2. Night initial time: switch over from day set-point to night set-point. After some tests, it was noted that the starting time proposed by BatIntel was not different from the one already used by the building and that the savings obtained by the optimization was solely due to the night initial time. This shows that the anticipated cooling of the building has no expected positive impact on its daily power consumption. For this reason, the work done on the cooling optimization strategy was focused only on the second variable, the night initial time, which is allowed to vary between 7PM and 10PM, which vindicates our choice for setting t beg savings = 7 PM and t end savings = 10 PM in the calculation of the energy savings in Eq. (13). Table 6 shows the estimated absolute and relative energy savings obtained by BatIntel over a 10-day period according to the performance criteria described in Eq. (13), while Table 7 provides the error of the model for the same period calculated from the formulae given in Eq. (8). In summary, the BatIntel solution allowed to obtain an average savings of 8.6%, i.e., an average amount of 1362.3 kWh. The maximum savings was attained in the last day, 07/09/2017, with a value of 11.6% and 1508 kWh. Note also that a savings of more than 10% was obtained during half the period. Moreover, it is important to notice that no \u201cexpert\u201d audit has been done in order to estimate the maximum possible savings for the BatIntel building. Therefore, it is not possible to evaluate whether the savings obtained by the BatIntel solution was small or large when compared to the maximum possible savings. As mentioned before, the errors shown in Table 7 are calculated from the definitions of T error and P error in Eq. (8), where the best compromise solution for the RC parameters were used for obtaining both the forecast and the actual values. The power error is about 12.2% on average while the indoor temperature error is of 2.4% on average. Notice that the uncertainty of the model is partly ascribed to the uncertainty inherent in the weather forecast. For instance, the mean errors in external temperature and in solar irradiance over the period are of 7% and 11%, respectively. Although these values are not too large, they still make an impact on the performance of the BatIntel model as the uncertainties are propagated. More statistics on the weather forecast data are given in Table 8 . The Fig. 10 illustrates in detail the savings obtained by BatIntel as well as the actual energy consumption of each day. Moreover, the Fig. 11 shows the actual power, the forecast non-optimized power and the forecast optimized power for each optimized day of the cooling season. Notice that the actual power is the result of the application of the BatIntel recommended actions based on the forecast optimized power given by the model and on the optimization strategy results; therefore, both curves (actual power and forecast optimized power) are typically close to each other at the night initial time \u2014 the only optimization variable \u2014 value proposed by BatIntel, but not necessarily in the remaining hours as there is no other recommended action to be taken. It can be viewed, however, that during the days of 10/08 and 07/09, in particular, the curves are far from each other around the night initial time, which is related to the corresponding errors being higher than 15% (cf. Table 7). As a result, the energy savings for these days are also affected. 5.3 Heating season 5.3.1 Calibration results The calibration was done with the data obtained from 31/01/18 to 27/02/18. The Fig. 12 shows the approximate Pareto frontier obtained from NSGA-II. The best compromise solution is situated at the lower right corner of the graph with power absolute error of 87.34 kW and power relative error of 6.2%, and MAPE value for indoor temperature of 3.62% with median deviation of 0.5°C. Since the variance of the temperature error is quite low among Pareto solutions, the best compromise solution is located in the lower right part of the Pareto boundary to favor a lower power error. The RC parameters values associated to this solution are given in Table 9 , which also presents the lower and upper bounds for each parameter. The thermal power and indoor temperature curves associated to the best compromise solution are shown in Figs. 13 and 14 , respectively. It can be concluded that the model has clearly identified the dynamics of the actual indoor temperature and power curves and that the curve fitting is successful, although there is a slight overestimation in power during some days. As in the case of cooling, it was noted that the gap in indoor temperature is rather small whereas the one in power consumption is larger, probably due to the fact that there is more variance in power than in indoor temperature and that the signal of the power is quite noisy. Figs. 15 and 16 show the thermal power and indoor temperature curves obtained from the model on one-week unseen historical data, respectively. As in the cooling season, the forecast curves are very close to the actual ones, which shows that the model behaves well in both seasons. Due to extremely low outdoor temperatures that reached less than −5 °C between the night of 25/02 and the morning of 26/02, the building operation schedule had to be changed and the day initial time was set to much earlier, thereby having an atypical power consumption and indoor temperature increase on 26/02. 5.3.2 Optimization strategy results The BatIntel optimization heating strategy was applied on 17 days between 15/02/18 and 06/04/18, providing an average savings of 11.7% (1198.2 kWh). This value is higher than the one of 8.6% obtained in the cooling season, which shows that our approach is more likely to give better results when heating systems are optimized rather than cooling machines for this type of building. However, one must consider the fact that all 3 decisions variables described in Section 3.1 were optimized in the heating case, while only the night initial time was optimized in the cooling demonstration. Besides, the time interval for the calculation of the savings is given by t beg savings = 4 AM and t end savings = 8 PM , which is much wider than in the cooling case. Therefore, there are more possibilities of improvement in the heating strategy. A detailed analysis of the savings obtained over this period is given in Table 10 where the daily performance of our approach is shown. In addition, Fig. 17 shows the daily actual consumption and savings side by side, while the daily curves of forecast and actual power are shown in Figs. 18 and 19 . As it can be seen, the results indicate that our approach performed very well, being able to attain a savings of 20%, with an average of 11.7%, which amounts to 1198.2 kWh. Note also that it attained a savings of more than 10% on 10 out of 17 days. The correspondence between the curves of actual power (in orange) and forecast optimized power (in green) from Figs. 18 and 19 show that the optimal set-points proposed by BatIntel were precisely applied by the building operators every day. In particular, the day initial time and the night initial time are identical on both curves. Furthermore, by comparing the forecast non-optimized power curve (in red), which denotes the typical building operation schedule without optimization, with the other two curves, it can be seen that the optimal strategies proposed by BatIntel have delayed the day initial time in order to reduce energy consumption while satisfying the comfort requirements. More precisely, this delay impacts the energy consumption only in the beginning of the day as the three curves become similar after a few hours. Table 11 presents the model errors in a daily basis during the tests with the optimization strategy following the definition in Eq. (8). The model average errors are of 8.2% in power and of 2.4% in indoor temperature, while the standard deviation is of 3.5% in power and 1.2% in indoor temperature. One can see that the errors are relatively small on average and close to the errors obtained during the calibration phase. Finally, the mean and the maximum absolute errors of the external temperature forecasts over the heating season is of 0.4 °C and 2.8 °C, respectively, while the mean relative error is of 4.5% As for the solar irradiance forecasts, they are not relevant for this season since the parameter associated to the solar irradiance, α , equals zero (cf. Table 9). 6 Conclusions A model-based predictive control approach that optimizes the planning of heating and cooling systems for tertiary sector buildings has been presented. It consists of a grey-box model that predicts the building heat load and indoor temperature and of optimization strategies that make use of this model in order to reduce the total energy consumption of the next day. The proposed approach was able to yield an energy reduction of 8.6% (1362.3 kWh) during the cooling season and of 11.7% (1198.2 kWh) during the heating season in a case study of a 25,000 m2 commercial building containing three gas boilers and two refrigeration units. Based on the experimental results shown in this paper, two key points can be stated: (1) the confirmed ability of the BatIntel model to represent the thermal behaviour of monozone buildings and to forecast their power consumption and indoor temperature based on a short period of historical data; and (2) the efficiency of the optimization strategy for reducing the energy consumption of this type of building while satisfying thermal comfort requirements. The proposed method also has some limitations. First of all, the model is single-zone, which means that it must be used for buildings with thermal use and activity type that are globally homogeneous. Multi-usage buildings with different activity schedules are more difficult to address. Concerning the deployment on real buildings, there are certain limitations. One of them is the collection of 2 to 4 week historical data with no missing data for the model calibration, given that the model needs to be regularly calibrated. In reality, the collection of real-time indoor temperature and thermal power data can sometimes be complicated, which can penalize the calibration of the model. Finally, the optimized setpoints coming from the optimization module are sometimes difficult to apply to the building because communication with the BMS is complex. Possible improvements for the current approach have been identified as the next steps in order to increase its performance and to make it applicable to a larger extent of buildings. For instance, the extension of a R6C2-type model to handle different thermal zones in a building is possible and useful when the building has different zones being heated and cooled in parallel. This extension would allow us to address buildings where the thermal behaviour is more complex without having to adapt the optimization strategy, but only the building model. Besides optimizing the night set-point temperature, one could also optimize the day set-point temperature (i.e. the set-point indoor temperature to be attained in the building during day time) and try to obtain an even lower energy consumption. In a higher level of control, a day set-point temperature for each working hour during the day could be considered in the optimization strategy.

        "dc:description": "This paper proposes a novel energy conservation measure that optimizes the planning of heating and cooling systems for tertiary sector buildings. It consists of a model-based predictive control approach that employs a grey-box model built from the building and weather data that predicts the building heat load and indoor temperature. Different from classical optimization approaches where the discretized differential algebraic equations are integrated into the optimization formulation, our model is calibrated using black-box multiobjective optimization, which allows for decoupling the predictive model from the optimization problem, thus having more flexibility and reducing the total computational time. Moreover, rather than requiring the angle of solar radiation, solar orientation and solar masks to calculate the radiation data, our approach requires only a simple model of the solar irradiance. The calibrated model is then used by heating and cooling optimization strategies that aim at reducing the energy consumption of the building in the next day while satisfying the indoor thermal constraints. The proposed approach was applied in a case study of a commercial building during heating and cooling seasons and the results show that it was able to yield up to 12% of energy savings while having a mean power forecast error of 8%.",
