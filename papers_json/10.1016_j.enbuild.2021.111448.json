ASHRAE Guideline 36: High-performance sequences of operation (SOO) for Heating, Ventilation, and Air-conditioning (HVAC) Systems has been demonstrated to save 17%-30% energy under ideal simulation environments. However, HVAC systems are susceptible to various types of faults in a real building operation. There are no existing studies that pertain to a comprehensive fault impact analysis of the high-performance control sequences suggested by ASHRAE Guideline 36 for HVAC systems. How these sequences handle and adapt to the various types of faults is still largely unknown. In this context, a comprehensive fault impact analysis and robustness assessment of the high-performance control sequences is conducted. A Modelica-based medium office virtual testbed is developed following the air-side and the plant-side SOO. A total of 359 fault scenarios in three different seasonal operating conditions (cooling, shoulder, and heating seasons) are injected into the baseline model. The evaluated key performance indexes (KPIs) include the operational cost, source energy, site energy, control loop quality, thermal comfort, ventilation, and power system metrics. The faults of the most negative impact are identified for different seasonal operating conditions over all the KPIs. The results also show that high-performance control sequences are well adapted for the vast majority (∼90%) of all the fault scenarios over all the KPIs in this study.

SOO Sequences of Operation VAV Variable Air Volume. 1 Introduction Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) accounts for more than 30% total electricity consumption in U.S. commercial buildings [1]. In a great proportion of large U.S. commercial buildings, the building automation systems (BAS) are installed to reduce operational cost by gathering the real-time data and controlling the system using intelligent automation sequences of operation (SOO). It is anticipated that more small and medium sized commercial buildings will have a BAS or a similar system for data motoring and data analytics in the era of IoT and artificial intelligence. However, majority of the existing SOO are sub-optimal due to the fact that the building control designers and contractors adopt different and ad-hoc SOO for each building even with the same application (e.g., multi-zone variable air volume (VAV) systems) based on diffuse and fragmented information [2], which leads to excessive wasted energy and undermined quality of service. The American Society of Heating Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Guideline Project Committee 36 was formed to develop and maintain the standardized and high-performance HVAC control sequences [3]. ASHRAE Guideline 36 (hereinafter Guideline 36) [4], High-performance Sequences of Operation for HVAC Systems, first published in 2018, provides best-in-class HVAC SOO to maximize the energy efficiency, improve system stability, enhance code compliance, and allow fault detection and diagnostics. The current version largely depends on the ASHRAE project RP-1455 [5] and covers mostly the air-side systems [6], e.g., VAV systems, dual duct systems, zone terminal boxes, and etc. Guideline 36 will be continuously developed with the state-of-the-art research on the high-performance SOO for HVAC systems, and expand the coverage to the whole building system types and configurations. For instance, the high-performance plant-side SOO will be integrated to Guideline 36 in the near future from the recently completed ASHRAE project RP-1711[7] and the advanced SOO for the dedicated outdoor air system from the future ASHRAE project RP-1865 will also be reflected in Guideline 36. The energy efficiency performance of Guideline 36 has been demonstrated by both laboratory tests and simulation-based studies [8,9]. 555 County Center, a 5-story office building in California, showed 15% whole building electricity saving and 56% of natural gas usage saving after retrofitting the BAS system using the Guideline 36 air-side SOO in the first test year [10]. Wetter et al. [11] implemented the air-side SOO from the Guideline 36 in a single-floor medium office building model and reported a saving of 30% annual site HVAC energy use with the acceptable thermal comfort compared to the old SOO published in 2006 by ASHRAE [12]. Zhang et al. [13] implemented and verified both air-side and plant-side control sequences in a Modelica-based simulation environment for a single- zone VAV system. Their simulation results showed that the Guideline 36 yielded a 17.3 % of annual HVAC energy saving compared to conventional baseline control strategies. However, these studies are all in a well-commissioning test setting or a fault-free simulation environment. In a real building operation, the HVAC systems are inevitably subject to various degrading and malfunctioned sensors and equipment, as well as operational faults [14], which could offset the energy savings from the adoption of the high-performance control sequences. To mitigate the fault impact and facilitate building energy managers to more effectively operate buildings, Guideline 36 includes a rule-based automatic fault detection and diagnostics. The sets of the possible diagnostics are provided when the certain fault conditions are met or violated. These rules, based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology air handling unit (AHU) Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD) research [15,16] and the engineering experience [17], are general to any AHU-based systems but may not be specific to the systems under the Guideline 36. In other words, the fault symptoms are still not presented clearly and systematically in the Guideline 36 since the faults at the component level may propagate through the whole system and cause cascading fault impacts. Furthermore, the SOO in the Guideline 36 are sophisticated enough to hardly predict impacts from a single fault impacts on the whole system. Haleem et al. [18] investigated the performance, in terms of in energy use and indoor environmental quality, of Guideline 36 in handling uncertainty from sensors and actuators. They concluded that using low-grade sensors and actuators instead of the standard tier would significantly degrade the system performance for the Guideline 36 SOO. Through a sensitivity analysis, they also stated that the inaccuracy in temperature sensors such as supply air temperature and zone air temperature sensors produced the most degradation compared to the AHU economizer dampers, terminal unit heating valves, and the fan loop components. Apart from the aforementioned uncertainties in the real building operations, the HVAC systems are susceptible to large amounts of faults coming from both individual components (e.g., HVAC equipment, sensors, etc.) and whole system (e.g., controls, design and operation) [19]. As far as the authors' best knowledge, there are no existing studies that pertains to the comprehensive fault impact analysis of Guideline 36\u2032s high-performance SOO for HVAC systems. How Guideline 36 handles and adapts to the various types of faults is also largely unknown. Given that, this study presents a comprehensive fault impact analysis, with the aim of providing more comprehensive and well-defined fault symptoms and identifying the faults with most negative repercussions towards Guideline 36 high-performance SOO for HVAC systems. 1.1 Related work There exist some studies on the fault simulation and fault impact assessment of HVAC systems in buildings. Kim et al. [19] evaluated and prioritized common faults in HVAC systems using proprietary impact estimation methods for the energy and financial perspectives. Instead of conducting a rough estimate, many researchers performed the fault simulation on top of the building energy simulation programs with development of necessary fault models [20]. Zhang et al. [21] developed new fault objects in EnergyPlus to model operational faults of HVAC systems including the sensor bias, fouling coils, and the dirty air filters. Li et al. [22] presented a large-scale EnergyPlus-based fault impact analysis framework in which parametric sensitivity analysis was adopted to determine and rank the fault criticality. A total of 129 fault modes were simulated for a medium-sized office building model. The considered faults include the physical faults from HVAC equipment and sensors, and the scheduling faults. Using a similar approach, Lu et al. [23] investigated a comprehensive sensor error impact analysis and ranked the sensor importance in a demand-controlled ventilation HVAC system. Kim et al. [24] developed and validated 25 fault models that represents in a small commercial building using EnergyPlus/OpenStudio. They generated the curated fault model simulation data set for FDD purposes [25] based on the developed fault models. Most existing fault simulation on HVAC systems have several common limitations in terms of the modeling fidelity and fault simulation coverage [20]. Most studies integrate the fault models into EnergyPlus, which is hard to directly model the pressure-related faults. To simulate the duct fouling in EnegyPlus, one needs to reflect the fault impact by adjusting the parameters in the fan model, e.g., pressure rise and maximum airflow rate. Furthermore, only a few studies consider the control-related faults and capture all the control sequence elements. The control-related and dynamic physical faults are difficult to simulate in EnergyPlus since EnergyPlus assumes a perfect control without local controllers and its smallest simulation interval is only 1 min. Given the significance of the control sequences on the HVAC quality of service, it is crucial to account for the control-related faults. In addition, the physical faults could have different fault symptoms depending on the control loop. For instance, different fault symptoms are found when the outdoor air damper under the Guideline 36 SOO compared to the conventional SOO [12]. Therefore, oversimplification of the control sequences will influence the fault modeling fidelity. Chen et al. [26] captured the dynamic and steady-state effects of several physical faults of a large commercial building using a virtual testbed in Modelica. Their simulation results showed that the physical fault impacts were corelated to the control sequences and the load conditions. However, they only considered a limited number of the physical faults, and the control sequences of the large office building is based on the ASHRAE 90.1\u20131989 and 90.1\u20131999. Wen et al. developed dynamic fault models in the HVACSIM + environment to simulate common faults from sensors, valves, dampers, coils, and controllers in a four-zone VAV system [27]. They also simulated common faults in the fan coil units [28], fan-powered system, and the dual fan dual duct system [29]. However, these studies mainly focused on the faults in the partial system such as the component-level unit [28] or the air-side HVAC system [27,29]. 1.2 Contributions Based on the above literature review, the contributions of this work are summarized as follows: \u2022 Compared with the literature reported studies, this study performs the most inclusive single fault impact analysis, which include faults from sensors, duct & pipes, controlled devices (dampers & valves), HVAC equipment, control, building envelope, system scheduling, and design & construction aspects. There are a total of 359 scenarios with different fault severities simulated in this study. Different from the idealization of the control sequences in most existing HVAC fault modeling studies, this study explicitly captures the fast-dynamic effects of the faults on the performance of the control sequences for the air-side, plant-side, and zone systems in an HVAC system. \u2022 This study reveals the fault impacts, under different fault severities and three seasonal operating conditions, caused by faults that exist in a system operated in accordance with the Guideline 36 high-performance SOO. The faults with most adverse impacts are identified and ranked. The robustness of the high-performance SOO with various faults is evaluated for multiple Key Performance Indexes (KPIs). \u2022 The generated massive data from dynamic HVAC systems with faults under the Guideline 36 could provide the data basis for testing and developing algorithms of fault detection and diagnostics. In particular, data containing faults associated to HVAC controls fill in the gap in literature [30]. For instance, a companion research based on the generated faulty data developed dynamic Bayesian network-based fault diagnosis algorithms for Guideline 36 [31]. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the development of the baseline building model with detailed implementation of control sequences according to the ASHRAE Guideline 36. Section 3 describes what the comprehensive fault list is, how various faults are injected into the building system model, and how the batch simulation of all the fault scenarios is performed. Section 4 discusses the key performance index (KPI) used for this study. Section 5 presents the fault impact analysis and fault robustness analysis of the high-performance SOO for three seasonal operating conditions. Section 6 summarizes our findings, limitations, and future work. 2 Medium office building virtual testbed In this section, the medium office building virtual testbed with the detailed implementation of air-side and water-side control sequences according to the ASHRAE Guideline 36 is described. The simulation testbed for this study was developed based on a five-zone medium office building model Guideline 36 in Modelica Buildings Library 7.0.0 [11,32]. The Guideline 36 model consists of a VAV system with terminal reheat units, a building envelope model, and a model for leakage air flow through building envelope and open doors. On top of that, in this study, a chilled water plant system and a boiler hot water system are added to the Guideline 36 model following the plant-side high-performance control sequences in the ASHRAE RP-1711 [7]. The developed virtual testbed schematics is shown in Fig. 1 . The testbed consists of four perimeter zones and one core zone, which is representative of one mid-floor of the new construction medium office building, as described in the set of U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Commercial Prototype Building Models [33]. Heating and cooling are delivered by a single-duct multi-zone VAV system. One AHU connected with five VAV terminal boxes serves five zones (four exterior zones, and one interior zone respectively) at one floor. The chilled water is supplied by a central chiller plant which consists of a chiller, a water-side economizer, a cooling tower, and associated one chilled water pump and one cooling water pump. A boiler, fed by the natural gas, supplies the hot water to the AHU heating coil. The reheat coils in the VAV terminals are electric resistance coils. The system is sized under the ASHRAE climate zone 5A Chicago, IL. The Modelica system model in this study is set up based on the middle floor of the EnergyPlus prototype medium office model [33,34]. The peak load and the HVAC system sizing in the Modelica system model are in similar range with the EnergyPlus prototype model. Supplementary Data Section 1 describes the detailed sizing parameters and the comparison to the DOE EnergyPlus prototype model. The HVAC system control sequences follow the state-of-the-art control sequences in ASHRAE Guideline 36\u20132018 [4] and ASHRAE project RP-1711 report [2]. Both air-side and plant-side high-performance operation sequences implemented in the virtual testbed are summarized in Table 1 . The plant-side controls were implemented using the Control Description Language [11] and verified in the open loop tests before integrated in the system [35]. 3 Fault simulation In this section, the setups and implementation of the fault simulation are detailed. Section 3.1 introduces the comprehensive list of the common faults to be studied. Section 3.2 presents the overall methodology of the fault injection and detailed implementation of different fault categories. Section 3.3 summarizes all the considered fault scenarios and describes how the batch fault simulation is performed. 3.1 Studied faults To cover a wide range of common faults, a thorough literature review was conducted over the multiple resources, including the existing building fault simulation [20\u201322,24\u201326,36], fault experiment datasets [27\u201329,37], commissioning tools [38\u201340], FDD routines [4,7,41], and conversation with the building experts. The considered faults are categorized into different fault types, as tabulated in Table 2 . 3.2 Fault injection In this section, how various fault models are developed and injected into the building virtual testbed are discussed. First, the component fault models are built upon the basic component models in Modelica Buildings Library [32]. A fault mode component is created as a record type in Modelica so we can define and group all fault mode properties together. The fault mode properties include Boolean parameter \u2018active\u2019 to activate the fault, the fault start time and end time, etc. The fault mode component is embedded in the component fault model to define the fault simulation properties. The component fault models can be categorized into three different fault injection types: variable, parameter, connector. The \u2018variable\u2019 type denotes the output variable of the original model is overwritten if the fault mode is activated during the fault injection period. One example of the \u2018variable\u2019 type fault is the sensor fault where the sensed variable is overwritten by the faulty value. The second type \u2018parameter\u2019 means the parameters in the fault model would be overwritten. The third \u2018connector\u2019 type means the fault models are injected through the connector. One typical example of the \u2018connector\u2019 type is the leakage fault where a leakage fault model is added to the leakage point through the connector. Second, the component fault models are integrated with the medium office model, by either replacing existing component models or by adding new models, to allow fault behaviors to be simulated at both component and system levels. For example, when the fault scenario of the temperature sensor bias is injected, the original temperature sensor model is replaced by the newly built sensor bias fault model. Fault models for various components, including sensor, duct and pipe, damper and valve, HVAC equipment, control, schedules, are described in more detailed in this paper as follows. 3.2.1 Sensor Sensors are inevitably prone to different types of errors which could be decomposed into three parts: multiplicative errors, bias, and noise [42], as shown in Eq. (1). V EP = ( 1 + m ) ∙ V EF + ε bias + ε noi , (1) where VEP and VEF represent the error-presented value and the error-free value, respectively. m is the multiplicative offset of the scaling error. ε bias and ε noi denote the deviation caused by the bias errors and the noise. In this study, a fixed bias is assumed in different key system locations. Sensors that are modeled with bias are described in Table 2. These sensors are used in the studied Guideline 36 control sequences. Since the air-side system of the studied building is a multi-zone VAV system, we do not consider all the zone sensor faults to avoid the repetition. Without loss of the generality, we assume the south zone sensor faults for the cooling and shoulder seasons, and the east zone sensor faults for the heating season. Both positive and negative sensor bias are considered, and different fault intensity values are used to represent different severities of the sensor faults. In this study, two tiers of sensor faults are considered to represent the moderate and the severe sensor faults. These fault intensity values are referred from the open literature [18,23] and FDD routines [4,7,16]. For example, according to the default error thresholds for the supply water temperature [24], we set the fault intensity of 1 K and 2 K, respectively, representing the moderate and severe sensor bias for the chilled supply water temperature while 2 and 4 K, respectively, representing the moderate and severe sensor bias for the hot supply water temperature. The sensor fault is implemented as a \u2018variable\u2019 type. The output (sensed variable) of the original sensor model in Modelica Buildings Library is overwritten by the faulty value when the fault mode is activated. 3.2.2 Duct & pipe Ducts and pipes are the passages to deliver or remove the fluid in the HVAC system. The common faults include the duct leakage, duct fouling, pipe clogging, and pipe poor insulation. Roth et al. identified the duct leakage as the most critical fault that leads to the second largest energy waste [43] and Wray et al. pointed out the duct leakage had a complicated impact on the energy performance in VAV systems due to the system variable response [44]. Duct fouling increased the pressure drop of the air loop and increased the fan energy consumption at certain level. Zhai et al. reported a change of −5.1 to 10.8% energy when the filters and ducts in the air loop were fouled [45]. Likewise, the pipe clogging due to the water pipe corrosion could increase the pump head and the pump energy consumption. Poor insulation in the piping system could result in the undesirable heat gain or losses. ASHRAE Standard 90.1 increased the minimum pipe insulation thicknesses requirement from the 2010 version but pipe insulation with a thickness less than designed values is still common [46]. The duct leakage is implemented as the \u2018connector\u2019 type. The mathematical expression is shown in Eq. (2). m ̇ EF + m ̇ L = k Δ p , (2) where m ̇ EF is the normal operation the mass flow rate and m ̇ L is the leakage mass flow rate. k is the friction factor and △p is the pressure drop. Two fault scenarios with a leakage mass flow rate equal to 10% and 20% of the supply main duct are considered. The duct fouling and pipe clogging are implemented as the \u2018parameter\u2019 type. The nominal resistances of all the duct/pipe are increased with 10% and 20% magnitudes. The pipe poor insulation is implemented as the \u2018parameter\u2019. We assume a perfectly insulated pipe for the baseline case. In the two fault scenarios, the insulation of a 20 m supply water pipe is damaged and its insulation thickness in the two fault scenarios is reduced to 20 mm and 5 mm, respectively. 3.2.3 Damper & valve Damper/valve regulates the air/water flow and fulfils a wide range of functions and locations in the HVAC system. As one of the most prevalent faults in this category, the damper/valve stuck fault could be due to (1) corrosion and degradation that cause the actuator to seize, which leaves the damper/valve in a fixed position; (2) a broken linkage [43]. In addition, damper/value leakage is also a common fault due to aging and oversizing. Here, a leaking damper or valve refers to a situation when the damper/valve is fully closed, yet there are still air/water passing through the controlled device. The leaky valves were reported to have an energy waste of 5 % of the building operational cost [43]. The damper/valve stuck fault is implemented as the \u2018variable\u2019 type since the output of the damper/valve is overwritten to a fixed value when the fault is injected. Different stuck positions (0%, 15%, 65%, 100%) are considered in this study according to the ASHRAE RP-1312 [27]. The damper/valve leakage fault is implemented as the \u2018parameter\u2019 type. The leakage ratio, defined as the following Eq. (3), is the ratio of the flow coefficient at the full closed position and the flow coefficient at the full open position. l = kv ( y = 0 ) kv ( y = 1 ) , (3) where l is the leakage ratio. kv is the flow coefficient, and y is the damper/valve opening position. In this study the leakage ratio in the damper/valve model is set with the value of 0.001 and 0.01 to represent the moderate and severe fault levels. The dampers/values considered in this study are summarized in Table 2. 3.2.4 HVAC equipment How HVAC equipment faults propagate to the whole system under Guideline 36 control sequences are investigated in this study. To be specific, chiller mechanical faults, boiler fouling, AHU cooling/heating coil fouling, cooling tower fouling, pump mechanical faults, and fan reduced motor efficiency fault are considered. The chiller faults include chiller condenser fouling, presence of non-condensable in refrigerant, nonstandard refrigerant charging (overcharge), and chiller excess oil. The empirical chiller fault models [47] as expressed in Eq. (4) are incorporated in the chiller model in Modelica Buildings Library. The original calculated chiller power is overwritten by the multiplier of the fault ratio as defined in Eq. (4). In this study, two fault intensity values are selected for each fault to represent the moderate and severe fault levels as suggested in [47]: chiller condenser fouled by 20% and 40%, non-condensable in refrigerant fault by 2.5% and 5%, overcharged by 20% and 40%, excess oil by 30% and 60%. W ̇ F W ̇ EF = a 1 + a 2 T evap , o u t + a 3 T cond , i n + a 4 Q ̇ evap + a 5 T evap , o u t Q ̇ evap + a 6 T cond , i n Q ̇ evap + a 7 Q ̇ evap 2 , (4) where w ̇ EF and w ̇ F are the chiller power consumption under the fault-free and faulty conditions. a 1 - a 7 are the regression coefficients for the empirical models. It is noted that each chiller mechanical fault has its own sets of regression coefficients. T evap , o u t and T cond , i n are the evaporator outlet water temperature and condenser inlet water temperature. Q ̇ evap is the heat transfer rate in the chiller evaporator. Deposits on the fireside and the water-side of the boiler tubes could impair the heat transfer and reduce the boiler efficiency [48]. The boiler efficiency could be reduced from 9.5% up to 69% depending on the deposit build-up thickness [49,50]. The boiler fouling in this study is implemented as the \u2018parameter\u2019 type. The boiler efficiency is reduced by 10% and 20% for the two fault intensity levels. For the fouling of the AHU cooling/heating coil and the cooling tower, these faults are implemented as the \u2018parameter\u2019 type, reflected by the nominal overall heat transfer coefficient (UA). Several field tests found the UA of the AHU cooling coil could decrease by 45\u201350% due to the fouling effects [51,52]. Therefore, in this study, the UA values are perturbed to three tiers, 10%, 30%, and 50% lower than the baseline values in the three fault scenarios. Pumps and fans are the devices to move the fluid to the desired location. The common faults of pumps include impellor fault, blade cavitation, bearing worn out, seal defect, motor degradation, etc. Sakthivel et al. [53] conducted laboratory experiment and identified how different pump faults affected the pump pressure head, the pump overall efficiency, and the pump power. To model the mechanical problems in this study, the cavitation fault and impellor fault are modeled by using different pump curves, as shown in Fig. 2 , which would overwrite the fault-free pump curve. Pump motor degradation fault is implemented as a \u2018parameter\u2019 type. The pump motor efficiency is assumed to be reduced by 15% and 30%, respectively for the two fault scenarios considered in this study. Due to the unavailability of the faulty fan curve data, we only consider the fan motor efficiency degradation fault. Likewise, the fan motor efficiency is assumed to be reduced by 15% and 30 %, respectively for the two fault scenarios considered in this study. 3.2.5 Control The appropriate settings and configurations of the control system are essential for maintaining the overall HVAC system quality of service. The following categories of the control related faults are investigated: (1) inappropriate PID controller parameter settings; (2) arbitrary control loop setpoints or disabled reset routines; (3) hysteresis of control signals or components. For the first fault type, we consider the fault scenarios in the following local control PID loops: Supply air temperature; Fan speed; Economizer outdoor air flow rate; Boiler hot water supply temperature; Chilled/Hot water pump speed; Cooling tower fan speed; Zone air temperature; Zone discharging air flow rate. To model the \u201cinappropriate PID controller parameter settings\u201d fault, the proportional gain P of the PID controller is perturbed to different order of magnitudes based on its baseline setting. For instance, if the baseline P value for the cooling supply air temperature control loop is 0.5. Accordingly, two fault scenarios with P value equal to 5 and 0.05 respectively are designed to represent the aggressive tuning and slow response cases. For the second fault type, i.e., \u201carbitrary control loop setpoints or disabled reset routines\u201d fault, two fault scenarios are designed: differential pressure setpoint is set to the maximum and Chilled/Hot supply water temperature is set to the maximum/minimum. The third fault type, i.e., \u201chysteresis of control signals or components\u201d fault, is implemented as the \u2018connector\u2019 type. Three fault scenarios are studied: Cooling/Heating coil valve input signal delay; Fan speed input signal delay; Chilled/Hot water pump speed input signal delay. The delay time is assumed to be 1 s based on the literature report for certain communication protocol [54,55], while the baseline cases assume a perfect delay-free communication. 3.2.6 Scheduling Approximately 90% of buildings do not operate around the clock and 70% of the buildings reduce the heating and cooling energy consumption during the unoccupied hours [56]. However, some building operators do not set back their HVAC system while unoccupied or unintentionally leave part of HVAC equipment on when they should be turned off. The following scheduling fault scenarios are studied for each season: delayed onset and early termination by 1 h, 2 h, and no overnight setback. The occupancy schedule parameters are adjusted to inject these faults. 3.2.7 Design & construction In this study, one design fault, HVAC equipment oversizing, and one construction fault, poor building airtightness, are considered. The HVAC equipment is sometimes oversized by the designers to ensure sufficient cooling/heating by applying a certain safety factor. As a result, the oversized equipment might lead to overall efficiency reduction. For example, an oversized water pumps would result in a larger flow rate of the water system and the low delta-T syndrome [57]. In this study, we consider oversizing faults for the following equipment: AHU supply fan, AHU cooling coil, AHU heating coil, chiller, boiler, and chilled/hot water pump. These faults are implemented as the \u2018parameter\u2019 type by enlarging their nominal values such as the nominal flow rate, nominal differential pressure, or the nominal performance curves to the next sizing value in the equipment catalogues. Building airtightness is defined as the resistance to inward or outward air leakage in the building envelope. The poor airtightness would lead to undesired infiltration and/or exfiltration. Building commissioning requirements from Standard 189.1 require a whole building test to demonstrate that the building meets a tightness limit [58]. The building airtightness fault is modeled as a \u2018parameter\u2019 type. The nominal differential pressure between the zone and the outside in the air leakage model is overwritten to be a smaller value under the same nominal mass flow rate, which indicates a decrease of the infiltration resistance. In this study, we consider two scenarios, i.e., infiltration resistance reduced to 70% and 50% of its baseline value. 3.3 Summary All of the 359 fault scenarios are simulated under the ASHRAE climate zone 5A Chicago, IL. In total, 359 fault scenarios are injected to the system fault model for three seasonal operating conditions. The number of fault scenarios in the cooling, shoulder, and heating season week is 127, 127, 105, respectively. Table 3 shows an example of the fault scenarios in the cooling season. Supplementary Data Section 2 lists all the fault scenarios for the three seasonal operating conditions. All the fault scenarios are simulated for one week in the given season and the injected single fault is assumed to happen continuously for one week. A Python package BuildingsPy [59] is used to run all the Modelica simulations and execute all proposed fault scenarios. All the simulations are conducted using Dymola 2021 on a Windows 10 machine with a 3.00 GHz CPU and a 16 GB RAM. CVODE [60], a variable time step solver, is selected due to its demonstrated efficiency and robustness of solving the non-linear thermal fluid system. Depending on the size and complexity of the fault models (e.g., number of the non-linear equations) and the load conditions, a single run for the weeklong fault scenario generally takes 90 \u2013 200 s. The simulation results are postprocessed with an interval of one minute. 3.4 Key performance indexes for fault impact analysis In this section, key performance indexes are designed to evaluate fault impacts from the aspects from energy consumption and energy cost, control quality factor, thermal comfort, ventilation, and the power system, as detailed in Section 4.1\u20134.5, respectively. The fault impacts of the KPIs are quantified by the metric discussed in Section 4.6. 3.5 Energy and cost Operational cost, source energy, and site energy, as shown in Eq. (5)-(7) respectively, are employed for fault impact analysis. C tot t 0 , t N = C Ele t 0 , t N + C Gas t 0 , t N = ∑ t 0 t N p ele t i ∙ E ele t i + p dem ∙ max P ele t i - R e v t 0 , t f + ∑ t 0 t N p gas t i ∙ E gas t i , (5) E Sit , t o t = ∑ t 0 t N E ele t i + ∑ t 0 t N E gas t i , (6) E Sou , t o t = f ele ∙ ∑ t 0 t N E ele t i + f gas ∙ ∑ t 0 t N E gas t i , (7) where N is the sampling number for each operation time step point t. C tot , C Ele , C Gas represent the total cost, electricity cost, and the natural gas cost respectively. E ele and E gas are the site energy for the electricity and natural gas. p ele , p dem , and p gas are the electricity energy price, the electricity demand charge, and the natural gas energy price. We assumed a fixed energy price for both electricity (0.12 $/kWh) [61] and natural gas (1.7 $/Therm) [62]. The demand charge is not considered in this study. E Sit , t o t and E Sou , t o t are the total site energy and source energy. f ele and f gas are the site-to-source ratio [63] with 2.80 and 1.05 applied for electricity and natural gas. 3.6 Control loop quality factor Guideline 36 contains multiple local control loops, most of which are a proportional\u2013integral (PI) type. Poor control loop quality could increase energy consumption, decrease thermal comfort, and reduce equipment life. Therefore, two control quality factors (CQF) are used to evaluate these local control loops [64,65]: Harris Index (denote as H) and Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) Index (denote as G). The mathematical forms are expressed in Eq. (8)-(9). Two CQFs are then time-averaged and mapped to 0\u20135 (5 means the best, 0 means the worst) to represent the weighted CQF scores over a given period. H ( t i ) = 1 - σ 2 mv ( t i ) σ 2 y ( t i ) , (8) G ( t i ) = K ( 1 - e - y - ( t i ) - r ( t i ) r ( t i ) ) , (9) where σ 2 mv is the expected minimum variance and σ 2 y is the variance of the control outputs. K is the scale factor. y - is the EWMA filtered value of the control outputs and r is the reference value. Please refer to [64,65] for further details. In the Guideline 36, the cooling and hearing coil valve position, return air damper position, and outdoor air damper position are all sequenced together to maintain the supply air temperature. In addition, the output of the supply air temperature control loop is also one of the key inputs in the plant on/off control. Therefore, the supply air temperature control loop is evaluated due to its significance in the Guideline 36. 3.7 Thermal comfort To evaluate the fault impact on thermal comfort, maximum zone air temperature deviation, total zone air temperature deviation, unmet ratio, and predicted percent of dissatisfied (PPD) are used, as expressed in Eq. (10)-(13). The maximum zone air temperature deviation dt max calculates the sum of the largest deviation of the zone air temperature in the five zones over the operation time period ( t 0 , t N ). The total zone air temperature deviation dt tot adds up the zone air temperature deviation in the five zones over the operation time period ( t 0 , t N ). The zone air temperature unmet ratio Unm dt is the ratio of the operation hours when the zone air temperature is out of the boundary and the total operation hours. The PPD index is a function of the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) [66], which is corelated to the dry bulb air temperature, mean radiant temperature, air velocity, metabolic rate, and clothing level. It provides an estimate of the proportion of the occupants in a space who would feel dissatisfied by the thermal conditions. dt max ( t 0 , t N ) = ∑ z ∈ Z max t 0 < t i < t N ( | s z ( t i ) | ) , (10) dt tot ( t 0 , t N ) = ∑ z ∈ Z ∑ t 0 t N | s z ( t i ) | , (11) Unm dt t 0 , t N = ∑ z ∈ Z ∑ t 0 t N c z ( t i ) t N - t 0 , (12) PPD = 100 - 95 e - 0.03353 P M V 4 - 0.2179 PMV 2 , (13) z is the zone index for the set of zones, and s z is the deviation from the lower and upper setpoint temperatures. The zone air cooling and heating temperatures setpoint are 24 ℃ and 20 ℃ in this study, respectively. The deviation range in this study is ± 1 ℃ from the setpoint. c z is the boolean function that determine if the zone air temperature is out of the deviation range. The mean radiant temperature is assumed to be 0.4 ℃ higher than the dry bulb zone air temperature using the conclusion from [67]. The air velocity is assumed as 0.1 m/s and the metabolic rate is set as 1 met. The clothing level for the cooling and heating season are 0.7 and 1.2 respectively. 3.8 Ventilation The outdoor air ratio (OAR) [68] is defined as the ratio of the actual outdoor air flow rate and the required outdoor air flow rate calculated based on ASHRAE 62.1\u20132019 [69]. Two OAR-based metrics are used to evaluate fault impacts: mean OAR OAR ave and OAR met ratio Met OAR , as shown in Eq. (15)-(16). OAR ave represents the mean OAR value over the operation time period ( t 0 , t N ). The larger the OAR ave value, the better the ventilation quality. OAR met ratio Met OAR is the ratio of the operation hours when the OAR is larger than 0.9 and the total operation hours. The rationale of the selection of 0.9 as a cut-off point [70] is because outdoor air flow meters will general exhibit at least 10% measurement error in practice. O A R t i = V OA , a c t t i V OA , r e q t i (14) OAR ave ( t 0 , t N ) = ∑ t 0 t N O A R ( t i ) t N - t 0 , (15) Met OAR t 0 , t N = ∑ t 0 t N c OAR ( t i ) t N - t 0 , (16) where V OA , a c t and V OA , r e q are actual outdoor air flow rate and required outdoor air flow rate based on ASHRAE 62.1\u20132019 [69]. c OAR is the Boolean function that determine if the OAR is larger than 0.9. 3.9 Power system Peak power pea and power diversity factor div are used as KPIs from the power system perspective, as shown in Eq. (17)-(18). Peak power pea is simply the highest electrical power demand of all the HVAC equipment over the operation time period ( t 0 , t N ). The power diversity factor div is defined as the ratio of the sum of the maximum electrical power demands of all the HVAC equipment to the coincident maximum demand of the HVAC system. The power diversity factor normally has a value larger than 1 and is equal to 1 if all the individual equipment electrical power demands occur simultaneously. p e a t i = max t 0 < t i < t N ∑ equ ∈ E P equ t i , (17) div ( t 0 , t N ) = ∑ equ ∈ E max t 0 < t i < t N P equ ( t i ) max t 0 < t i < t N ( ∑ equ ∈ E P equ t i ) , (18) where P equ denotes the power demand of equipment equ which belongs to the HVAC equipment set E. 3.10 Fault impact Fault impact ratio (FIR) in Eq. (19) represents how negative the performance has changed due to the fault in respect to the performance that is normally expected [71]. The FIR is larger than zero for the negative impact while is smaller than zero for the positive impact. KPIs in Eqs. (5)-(13), (15)-(18) can be directly represented by this fault impact ratio. The sign function sgn depends on which KPIs are considered and is shown in Eq. (20). FIR = s g n ( K P I ) · KPI faulted - KPI unfaulted KPI unfaulted , (19) sgn = 1 , K P I f o r E q s .

(20) 4 Results and discussions The fault simulation results are presented and discussed in this section. First, the fault symptoms and associated fault impacts over different KPIs are presented for each fault category in Section 5.1. The fault impacts of the most negative fault scenarios are highlighted and justified. Besides the observations and physical explanations of the fault symptoms, the considered fault scenarios are ranked for each seasonal operating condition in Section 5.2. As a further step, the fault impact ratio distributions are depicted in Section 5.3 to show the fault robustness of Guideline 36 over the considered fault scenarios. 4.1 Fault impact analysis for each fault category Representative results of the fault impact analysis are presented to keep the paper reasonably concise, as shown in Table 4 . KPIs are calculated for different fault scenarios and visualized using color maps shown in Fig. 3 - Fig. 10. The row represents different fault scenarios, and the column represents different KPIs. For each KPI column, the cell color represents the normalized FIR, which is the FIR value divided by the maximum FIR in each column. The color bar scale is from the most positive fault impact of −1 to the most negative fault impact of 1. 4.1.1 Sensor Fig. 3 shows the fault impacts, using the proposed KPIs, for sensor faults during the cooling season week. Since the building consumes little gas consumption during cooling season and a fixed electricity rate is adopted in this study, the fault impacts of the operational cost, the site energy, and the source energy share a similar trend for each fault scenario. In terms of the operational cost/site energy/source energy, cooling water temperature sensor, outdoor air flow rate sensor, AHU supply air temperature sensor, zone air temperature sensor, and zone air flow rate sensor are comparatively most prone to fault impacts under Guideline 36\u2032s high-performance SOO. We can also see that different sensor bias directions (e.g., positive, negative) and fault severities (e.g., 1 K, 2 K) will influence the results differently. Taking the cooling water temperature sensor positive bias as an example, the positive sensor bias will increase the setpoint used in cooling tower speed control and lead to more cooling effects on the chiller condenser side than required, which results in an increased cooling tower fan energy and a decreased chiller energy consumption. The negative sensor bias will have an opposite effect. However, it is noted that even the worst case (cooling water supply temperature sensor positive bias of 2 K) only has a fault impact ratio of 6.5%. From here we can conclude that Guideline 36\u2032s high performance SOO have a robust energy and cost performance for the common sensor bias faults in the cooling season. Regarding the control loop performance of the supply air temperature, only the sensor bias from the AHU supply air temperature could worsen the control performance since this sensor directly acts on the supply air temperature control loop. For the zone air temperature variations, the results show that only the zone air temperature sensor will have a direct negative impact compared to the sensor faults in other locations. As a direct thermal comfort metric, the PPD does not have a significant increase over all of the cooling fault scenarios. For the ventilation performance, the return air temperature sensor is the most critical among all the sensor fault scenarios considered. This is because the economizer high end limit is using a differential dry-bulb temperature in the studied sequences. When the return air temperature sensor has a severe positive bias, the economizer operation will be falsely disabled with the misjudgment that the return air temperature is warmer than the outside air temperature. The outdoor air flow rate sensor is also critical due to its direct impact on the ventilation control. For the HVAC system peak power, severe positive bias of the AHU supply air temperature sensor and severe negative bias of the zone discharging air temperature sensor will both lead to a non-negligible power spike. This is because these two faults will cause the overcooling of the zones and thus the spasmodic operation of the zone terminal electric reheat coils. Furthermore, the considered sensor faults will not downgrade the power diversity in the cooling season. 4.1.2 Duct & pipe Fig. 4 shows the fault impact, using the proposed key KPIs, for duct & pipe faults in all three seasons. From the energy and cost perspective, the supply duct leakage faults have a dominant impact compared to the other faults. The severe duct leakage will not only increase the fan energy consumption but also the energy consumption from the plant-side HVAC equipment. We can also see that poor pipe insulation in the heating season has more effects than that in the other seasons. For the supply air temperature control loop quality, the severe air duct leakage in the cooling and heating seasons has a more negative effect than that in the shoulder season. For the zone air temperature variations, thermal comfort, ventilation and power diversity, the faults from pipe and duct have no discernible impact. It is also noted that severe duct leakage could lead to a power spike in all three seasons. 4.1.3 Damper & valve Fig. 5 shows the fault impact, using the proposed KPIs, for damper & valve faults in all three seasons. It can be seen that the valve/damper leakage has a negligible impact on all KPIs in all three seasons. This is because the valve/damper leakage only have some effects when the valve/damper is near full closed. However, this occasion is very limited for both modulating/isolation valve/damper in the study. The cooling/heating coil stuck fault has different fault impacts for different stuck positions. When the valve is stuck at a smaller position than normal, the supply air temperature could not be maintained. Therefore, the AHU fan would be driven to a higher speed and consume more energy. When stuck at certain very small valve positions, the bypass valve will be opened to maintain the plant equipment minimum flow rate and the plant equipment will operate under a small thermal load condition. On the other hand, when the cooling/heating valve is stuck at a fully open position, the plant-side equipment will consume more energy while the fan energy consumption will be reduced. If the zone is overcooled or underheated, the electric reheat will be triggered to maintain the zone air temperature requirement. These are the main reasons why we have different fault impact results in terms of the energy and cost for different stuck positions and seasons. In the cooling season, the cooling coil valve stuck at the 65% open position has the most negative impact on the energy and cost. In the shoulder season, the cooling coil valve stuck at small open positions has the worst effect on the energy and cost. In the heating season, the heating coil valve stuck at the full closed position consume the most source energy and cost. For the supply air temperature air temperature, the control quality for all three seasons is undermined because the valve is the actuator in this control loop. For the zone air temperature variations, the valve stuck at smaller positions in all seasons have an obvious impact. For the thermal comfort, the valve stuck at smaller positions in the cooling and shoulder season will cause the comfort degradation while in the heating season the thermal comfort is unaffected because the zone terminal reheat will be activated if the heating is insufficient from the system level. It is also noted that the peak power is largely increased for the fully open stuck valve in the cooling and shoulder season. This is because the zone is overcooled due to the provided low supply air temperature, thus triggering the instantaneous electric reheat in the VAV terminals. The results show that the OA damper stuck fault will not only influence the energy and ventilation performance but also the thermal comfort in the cooling and shoulder season. Under Guideline 36\u2032s high-performance SOO sequences, the economizer dampers are not interlocked, and they are sequenced together with the cooling/heating coil valves per Section 5.16.2.3 in Guideline 36 [4]. Under conventional economizer SOO, when the OA damper stuck at fully closed position in the cooling and shoulder season, the PI loop that attempts to control the OA damper to maintain mixed air or supply air temperature will try to fully open the OA damper and hence fully close the recirculation damper and fully open the exhaust air damper (since all three dampers are typically interlocked). As a result, the OA damper is stuck at fully closed position and the recirculated damper is controlled to be fully closed position. This will cause instability of the whole system. From the energy and cost perspective, the OA damper stuck at large opening position have the most negative impact due to the excessive outdoor air. For the supply air temperature control loop quality, the OA damper stuck near full closed in the cooling and shoulder season will have a propagating effect on this control loop. Furthermore, the zone air temperature variations, thermal comfort, ventilation, peak power and power diversity are all impacted by the fault. It is also noted that the OA damper stuck at a higher opening position in the heating season will have an adverse impact on the energy, cost, zone air temperature variations, and power peak. The power spike is mainly from the increased fan power and instantaneous zone terminal electric reheat caused by the excessive outdoor air. 4.1.4 HVAC equipment Fig. 6 shows the fault impacts, using the proposed KPIs, for HVAC equipment faults, during the cooling season week. From the energy and cost perspective, the severe cooling coil fouling has the largest fault impact. The severe chiller non-condensable gas fault needs also to be noted. For the supply air temperature control loop, the quality declines sharply when the cooling coil has a severe fouling. The thermal comfort, zone air temperature variations, peak power, and power diversity are all affected by this fault. The HVAC equipment faults seem to have little impact on the ventilation performance in the cooling season. 4.1.5 Control Fig. 7 shows the fault impacts, using the proposed KPIs, for control faults during the cooling season week. In terms of the energy and cost, the results show that inappropriate PID settings for critical local controls used in Guideline 36 do not have a substantial effect. The worst fault impact is caused by the small P value scenario of the economizer PID loop, which increases the energy consumption by 4.8% due to the slow response of the outdoor damper position. When the chilled water temperature setpoint is fixed and set to the maximum value (10 ℃), the energy penalty is 19.6% of the baseline because the cooling provided from the plant is insufficient which drives the AHU supply fan to work much harder. This fault will also jeopardize the supply air temperature control quality and the peak power. For the zone temperature variations and the thermal comfort, only the slow response tuning from the zone air cooling control loop matters. The aggressive tuning of the economizer PID loop would harm the ventilation performance. Fig. 8 shows the fault impacts over key KPIs of control faults during the shoulder season week. Different form the cooling season, the supply air temperature air PID loop settings are more prone to control faults. If the P value is set too small in the shoulder season, the chiller would be called on late and more fan energy consumption is consumed at this time due to the sluggish response of the cooling coil valve, which results in sluggish supply air temperature control. The supply air temperature air control quality, thermal comfort, ventilation, and peak power will all then be strongly affected. When the chilled water temperature setpoint is set to its maximum value (10 ℃), the supply air temperature could not track its setpoint and the energy and cost will be increased by 6%. 4.1.6 Scheduling Fig. 9 shows the fault impacts, using the proposed KPIs, for scheduling faults for all three season weeks. The results show that all the faults exert a negative impact on the energy and cost in all the seasons. It is noted that no temperature setback of the zone thermostats has the worst FIR on the operational cost of 19.8%, 12.5%, and 50.6%, respectively for the cooling, shoulder, and heating week. Although this fault has little influence on the zone air temperature variations and thermal comfort during the occupied period, the ventilation performance indexes decline due to the reduced supply air flow rate and the resulting reduced outdoor air flow rate. 4.1.7 Design & construction Fig. 10 shows the fault impacts, using the proposed KPIs, for design and construction faults for all three season weeks. The oversized cooling water pump has a worse impact on the energy cost than other oversized equipment in the cooling and shoulder season because the cooling water pump is only operated at the constant speed in the studied system. The oversized equipment faults have little impact on the other KPIs besides the energy and cost in three seasons. For the poor building airtightness, the simulation shows it has a noticeable impact on the energy and cost in the heating season compared to the other two seasons. This fault would also have minimal effects on the other KPIs besides the energy and cost in the three seasons. 4.2 Fault ranking for each seasonal operating condition Section 5.1 indicates that fault impacts are correlated to the seasonal operation conditions. Having discussed detailed results for each fault category, in this section, we will identify faults that have the most negative impact for each seasonal operating condition. For each KPI, all the fault scenarios in one seasonal operating condition are ranked in a descending order. The fault impact ratio described in Section 4.6 is used as the variable to sort the fault scenarios. The similarity and difference of the fault ranking among different seasonal operating conditions are also pointed out. 4.2.1 Fault ranking for the cooling season Fig. 11 illustrates the fault ranking list of the top ten faults in terms of fault impact ratio in the cooling season. For the energy and cost, the top five faults with negative impact are: severe cooling coil fouling, severe supply air duct leakage, and cooling coil valve stuck fault at the positions smaller than the normal case. For the supply air temperature control loop quality, the most influential faults are cooling coil valve stuck at the positions smaller than the normal case and inappropriate CHW supply temperature setpoint. For the zone air temperature variations and thermal comfort, top five faults that cause negative impact come from the cooling coil valve stuck fault at small positions and OA damper stuck at very small position. It is noted that their impacts are even higher than the zone terminal control and sensor faults. For the ventilation performance, top five faults that have negative impact come from OA damper stuck at small positions and return air temperature sensor positive bias. The severe supply air temperature positive bias and cooling coil valve stuck at fully open almost double the peak power, which needs attention from the power grid perspective. The maximum FIR for power diversity factor is less than 10%, which indicates the insignificance of the fault impact on this KPI. Looking at all the KPI columns, we can see that the severe cooling coil fouling and cooling coil valve stuck at the positions smaller than the normal case appear in majority of the columns, which indicates they are most fault-influential in the cooling season considering multiple KPIs. 4.2.2 Shoulder season Fig. 12 illustrates the fault ranking list of the top ten faults in terms of fault impact ratio in shoulder season. For the energy and cost, the top five faults with negative impact are: cooling coil valve stuck fault at the positions smaller than the normal case and the severe supply air duct leakage. For the supply air temperature control loop quality, the most influential faults are: OA damper stuck at full closed and cooling coil valve stuck fault. For the zone air temperature variations and thermal comfort, similar findings could be obtained that the top five faults with negative impact come from the cooling coil valve stuck fault at small positions and OA damper stuck at very small position, whose impacts are higher than the zone terminal control and sensor faults. For the ventilation performance, top five faults with negative impact come from OA damper stuck at small positions, no temperature setback scheduling fault, and the slow response setting of the supply air temperature control. In terms of the peak power, cooling valve stuck at 100%, supply air temperature sensor severe positive bias, and supply air temperature control fault are top three faults with negative impact on the power grid. Looking at all the KPI columns in the shoulder season, we can see that the cooling coil valve stuck at the positions smaller than the normal case appear in majority of the columns. Overall, although some ranking sequences are different for certain KPI, the faults appear in the ranking list looks similar to the cooling season. 4.2.3 Heating season Fig. 13 illustrates the fault ranking list of the top ten faults in terms of fault impact ratio in heating season. For the energy and cost, the most negative impact faults are: no temperature setback scheduling fault and coil valve stuck at full closed. The zone air temperature severe sensor negative bias will impact heavily on the overall energy and cost due to the major increase from the terminal electric resistance coil power consumption. For the supply air temperature control loop quality, the most influential faults are heating coil valve stuck faults. For the zone air temperature variations and thermal comfort, the most negative impact faults come from the zone air temperature sensor faults, which is different from results in the cooling and shoulder season. The sluggish tuning of the supply fan speed control also impacts the thermal comfort in a negative way. For the ventilation performance, top faults with five negative impact are: OA damper stuck at small positions, no setback schedule fault, and economizer control fault. In terms of the peak power, the OA damper stuck at a large position and heating valve stuck faults matter the most. Overall, the faults in the ranking list are more diversified in terms of the fault category and the fault list appears to be dissimilar compared to the cooling and shoulder season. 4.3 Fault impact ratio distribution for each KPI In this section, the fault impact ratio distributions in each seasonal operating condition for different KPIs are illustrated in the form of the boxplot as shown in Fig. 14 - Fig. 18. To provide insight of the FIR high limit for majority of the fault scenarios, the interquartile range (IQR) rules with the multiplier of 1.5 are used to exclude the \u201coutliers\u201d that represent the fault scenarios with the outstanding FIRs. In the boxplots, the raw data are also depicted as the stripplot to show the observations along with some representation of the underlying distribution. The median value and the maximum value after excluding the \u201coutliers\u201d are also annotated in the figures. 4.3.1 Energy and cost Fig. 14 depicts the fault impact ratio distribution in terms of operational cost, source energy, and site energy over all fault scenarios in three seasons. It can be seen that the FIR distributions for the operational cost and source energy show a subtle distinction while the FIR distributions for the site energy in the cooling and shoulder season have a wider spread than that in the heating season. The FIR upper fences for these KPIs are less than 6% which indicates that overwhelming majority of the faults (∼90%) have minor effects on the energy and cost for the Guideline 36 sequences. 4.3.2 Supply air temperature control loop quality Fig. 15 depicts the fault impact ratio distribution in terms of the supply air temperature control loop quality over all fault scenarios in three seasons. For the two indexes, the FIR distribution in the shoulder season is more distinctive than that in the cooling and heating season. The FIR upper fence for this control loop is less than 5% over the three seasons which indicates that the vast majority of the faults (∼90%) have slight impacts on the supply air temperature control loop for the Guideline 36 sequences. 4.3.3 Thermal Comfort Fig. 16 depicts the fault impact ratio distribution for the thermal comfort metrics over all fault scenarios in three seasons. For the maximum value of the zone air temperature deviation, the FIR distribution in the shoulder season has a wider range compared to the cooling and heating seasons. For the total zone air temperature deviation and the unmet hour ratio, the FIR distribution in the cooling has a broader spectrum compared to the other two seasons. Although the FIR of these two KPIs has a wider range in the cooling season, the PPD in the cooling season is barely affected. This is because the total zone air temperature deviation and the unmet hour ratio for the baseline case are very small, which are 0.16 K·h and 0.4%, respectively. Even with a FIR of 100%, these two KPIs becomes 0.32 K·h and 0.8%, which are considered as small temperature deviation and unmet hour ratio. As for the PPD in all three seasons, the maximum and median value are both rounded to 0, which implies all the fault scenarios would have no bearing on the thermal comfort. 4.3.4 Ventilation Fig. 17 depicts the fault impact ratio distribution for the ventilation performance over all fault scenarios in three seasons. Although the ventilation performance in some fault scenarios is reduced by a great ratio (e.g., larger than 10% or less than −10% as indicated in this figure), the negative impact from the majority of the fault scenarios is insignificant as the maximum FIR values for all the seasons are 0. 4.3.5 Power system Fig. 18 depicts the fault impact ratio distribution from the power system perspective over all fault scenarios in three seasons. For the peak power, the FIR distributions in three seasons are similar and the maximum FIR value is less than 7% over the three seasons. For the power diversity factor, the ranges of distribution are narrow, which suggests that the impact from all the fault scenarios on power diversity is minimal. 5 Conclusions and limitations Robustness to various types of faults should be one of the aspects to evaluate high-performance sequences of operation. In this paper, a comprehensive fault impact analysis and robustness assessment of the high-performance SOO from the ASHRAE Guideline 36 is conducted. A Modelica-based medium office virtual testbed is developed according to the air-side and the plant-side SOO in the ASHRAE Guideline 36. A total of 359 fault scenarios in three different seasonal operating conditions are injected into the baseline model. The evaluated KPIs include the operational cost, source energy, site energy, control loop quality, thermal comfort, ventilation, and power system metrics. The results show that the fault impact is related to the seasonal operation conditions. For the same fault scenario, its FIR has certain variance over the three seasonal conditions. For the cooling season, severe cooling coil fouling and cooling coil valve stuck at the positions smaller than the normal case are identified to be the most influential faults for the majority of the KPIs. For the shoulder season, cooling coil valve stuck at the positions smaller than the normal case is still the top influential fault, but the severe cooling coil fouling has less effects over multiple KPIs. For the heating season, the top influential faults become more diversified. The no temperature setback fault, the heating coil stuck fault, and the zone air temperature bias are top-ranked among multiple KPIs. The vast majority (∼90%) of all fault scenarios have a FIR that is less than 6% on the energy consumption and energy cost with a fixed-rate structure, which suggests Guideline 36 sequences are well adapted for the faults from the energy and cost perspective in this study. Likewise, for other KPIs, the FIR distributions indicate that most of the fault scenarios would have limited influence on the supply air temperature control quality, the thermal comfort, the ventilation performance, and the power system. In this study, the comprehensive fault simulation is conducted in Chicago, 5A. Only scenarios with single fault are studied, and all the faults are assumed to happen at all times in each tested week. In addition, the fault impact and robustness analysis are applied to the medium office building virtual testbed following the ASHRAE Guideline 36. The future work includes the consideration of the common combinations of multiple faults, the degradation faults, the detailed fault occurrence, and the annual fault impact analysis on the other commercial building types and weather profiles as detailed as follows: 1) Extension of fault modeling to cover multiple faults In this study, each fault scenario only considers one single fault. Although it may not be common that only a single fault happens in the field, the fault impact evaluation of the single fault could provide us the insight of the fault sensitivities and the basic robustness of the SOO, which is widely adapted by researchers for fault modeling and fault prevalence studies [24,26,30,37]. As a next step, we will include the common combinations of multiple faults to see how the SOO reacts to these multiple faults. 2) Extension of fault modeling to cover degradation faults The fault severity is assumed unchanged for a given fault scenario. This study performs the weeklong fault simulation and therefore the impact of the fault evolving over the simulation time could be neglected. As an ongoing work, the fault simulation testbed has been extended for the annual fault simulation and the degradation faults are being implemented (e.g., gradual air-side and water-side coil fouling, sensor gradual degradation, fan and pump performance degradation, etc.). Besides the insights from the associated fault symptoms, the generated data could be used for the fault prognostic algorithm development. 3) Considerations of fault prevalence instead of fixed fault prevalence Obtaining realistic fault prevalence is a challenging task. There are several on-going national activities [72] that focus on this topic. However, we are just at the dawn of having a thorough understanding of fault prevalence in a real building. Our framework allows more realistic fault prevalence to be implemented should they become available. 4) Extension of climate zones to include more load conditions This study is only using the building in Chicago, IL (i.e., Climate Zone 5A). Considering multiple climate regions would strengthen and verify the results in this study by investigating the impact of different load conditions. As an ongoing work, we have applied the same methodology to a warm and humid Climate Zone 3A. The fault symptoms and the associated impact of the single faults in Climate zone 3A behave similar as reported in this study. More typical climate regions will be included in the future work and reported to the research community. 5) Extension of single-criteria KPIs to weighted multi-criteria KPIs This study evaluates the fault impacts on the single-criteria KPIs. In the future work, weighted multi-criteria KPIs (e.g., the KPI that considers the tradeoff between the energy consumption and the thermal comfort) will be used to balance the fault impacts on multiple KPIs. Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

        "dc:description": "ASHRAE Guideline 36: High-performance sequences of operation (SOO) for Heating, Ventilation, and Air-conditioning (HVAC) Systems has been demonstrated to save 17%-30% energy under ideal simulation environments. However, HVAC systems are susceptible to various types of faults in a real building operation. There are no existing studies that pertain to a comprehensive fault impact analysis of the high-performance control sequences suggested by ASHRAE Guideline 36 for HVAC systems. How these sequences handle and adapt to the various types of faults is still largely unknown. In this context, a comprehensive fault impact analysis and robustness assessment of the high-performance control sequences is conducted. A Modelica-based medium office virtual testbed is developed following the air-side and the plant-side SOO. A total of 359 fault scenarios in three different seasonal operating conditions (cooling, shoulder, and heating seasons) are injected into the baseline model. The evaluated key performance indexes (KPIs) include the operational cost, source energy, site energy, control loop quality, thermal comfort, ventilation, and power system metrics. The faults of the most negative impact are identified for different seasonal operating conditions over all the KPIs. The results also show that high-performance control sequences are well adapted for the vast majority (∼90%) of all the fault scenarios over all the KPIs in this study.",
