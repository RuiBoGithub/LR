This paper presents a centralized neighbourhood energy management with coordinated smart home energy-sharing model for neighbourhood smart homes, which are integrated with in-house renewable energy resources and energy storage systems. The main aim of this neighbourhood energy management model is to minimize the aggregated electricity bill of all smart home consumers in the neighbourhood area by increasing the utilization of local renewable energy generation. The effective combination of time of use pricing, feed-in-tariff scheme and fixed incentive method is considered in this model to encourage the more electricity transactions among the neighbourhood smart homes. A group of ten smart homes with different level of renewable energy integration and load profiles is considered as a test system to determine the performance of the proposed neighbourhood smart home energy management model. The simulation results show that the centralized neighbourhood coordinated smart home energy management model can provide significant economic benefits to all smart home consumers in the neighbourhood area, when compared to the without neighbourhood power-sharing case. From the results, it is noted that all smart homes together get 56.23% of cost savings in a day with the proposed model when compared to the baseline model. Finally, an economic analysis has also done in this paper to investigate the capital investment benefits of all smart home consumers in neighbourhood area. From the economic analysis, it is clearly noticed that with the proposed model the annual profits of all smart homes (SHs) in the neighbourhood area are improved by 54.48% for SH1, 59.88% for SH2, 85.03% for SH3, 41.55% for SH4, 30.68% for SH5, and 34.70% for SH6 respectively when compared to without neighbourhood energy sharing concept.

The modernization of the current electric grid called smart grid, which uses bi-directional power flow and information infrastructure to make the distributed and automated power system network (Nolan & O\u2019Malley, 2015; Zhu, Lambotharan, Chin, & Fan, 2015). The advanced metering infrastructure, information and communication technologies mainly enable the active participation of consumers in the grid operation at the end-user level. The smart homes are the small energy systems at the end-user level, which are capable to maintain efficient home energy management operations by controlling the electricity consumption of smart appliances. The smart homes are equipped with in-house renewable power generation units, battery energy storage system along with the smart controllable loads (Gungor et al., 2011; Melhem, Grunder, Hammoudan, & Moubayed, 2017). The renewable energy based distributed generation (DG), the electric vehicle to grid integration, demand side management (DSM)/ demand response (DR) programs, and efficient energy storage system concepts are the important objectives to achieve under smartgrid environment for better system energy operation and management (Zazo, Zazo, & Macua, 2016). The smart homes with the integration of in-house renewable energy resources (RERs) can be a one of the possible solution for the present global energy crisis. The renewable power generation is usually in intermittent nature, which can be effectively handled with help of DR techniques. The DSM methods mainly minimize the imbalance between the load and generation under any uncertain conditions (Strbac, 2008). The home energy management (HEM) programs, energy efficiency programs and demand response/load management programs are all come under the DSM schemes. DR is a most reliable and popular program to control the electricity usage of end-use consumer by adjusting or curtailing their load demand (Wang, Yang, & Liu, 2017). Generally, DR methods are classified into time based/price based DR programs and incentive based DR programs. The consumers are encouraged to reduce their power consumption in the incentive based DR program by providing the attractive financial payments. The incentive based DR programs include the interruptible/curtailable rates, emergency DR programs, and direct load control programs. In the price based DR programs, the consumers\u2019 electricity consumption behaviour is changed by introducing the various time-varying price signals like real-time pricing (RTP), time of use (ToU), critical-peak pricing (CPP) and so on (Celik, Roche, Bouquain, & Miraoui, 2016; Fahrioglu & Alvarado, 2000; Ruiz, Cobelo, & Oyarzabal, 2009). The rapid increase in demand for electricity and the emergence of the smart grid have dealing optimistic opportunities for home energy management systems (HEMS). The HEMS usually creates optimal energy consumption of all smart home controllable appliances by considering multiple objectives such as minimization of energy cost, minimization of environmental concerns, improvement of load profile, maximization of consumer comfort, and so on. The smart home with the integration of RERs such as solar photovoltaic units and micro-wind turbines and battery storage systems can provide in-house power generation and also give the option of exporting power to the grid (Gill, Yang, Yao, & Lu, 2009; Han, Choi, Park, Lee, & Kim, 2014). The advanced metering infrastructure along with latest communication and information technologies play key role to implement the smart home energy management operations. There are many studies available in the literature on smart home energy management system models. The price responsive based demand response strategy was developed in Li, Zhang, Roget, and O\u2019Neill (2013) for residential household energy management through the computational experiment technique. In Duman, Erden, Gönül, and Güler (2021), a smart thermostat was integrated with the home energy management system to minimize the daily operating cost and the smart thermostat targets the efficient maintenance of thermal comfort. The model of smart homes connected with block-chain based smart controllers was proposed in Kolahan, Maadi, Teymouri, and Schenone (2021) to minimize the overall energy consumption and improve the users comfort and peak to average ratio. A game theory based distributed HEM model was proposed in Mohsenian-Rad, Wong, Jatskevich, Schober, and Leon-Garcia (2010) to minimize the total residential energy cost. In Huang, Wang, Guo, Kang, and Wu (2016), a chance constrained optimal HEM model was proposed by considering the uncertainties of load and electric price. A multi-objective HEM model was proposed in Khalid et al. (2018) to minimize electricity and peak to average ratio simultaneously. The HEM strategies along with in-house power generation can give more benefits to smart home consumers as well as utilities. In Mansouri et al. (2021), a tri-objective optimization model for smart homes was proposed in a multi microgrid environment to minimize the overall operating cost, peak-to-average ratio index and emission. An integrated HEM system with PV and EV model was proposed in Huy, Dinh, and Kim (2023), to solve a multi objective energy management problem, where the objectives are minimization of overall operating cost, discomfort index, and PAR index. An intelligent HEM model was proposed in Arun and Selvan (2017a) for smart buildings to minimize the electricity bill under the integration of in-house renewable energy resources. The robust optimization based energy management model was proposed in Melhem, Grunder, Hammoudan, and Moubayed (2018) with the presence of renewable energy resource, battery storage system and electrical vehicles. The flexibility management model was proposed in Lezama, Soares, Canizes, and Vale (2020) for smart home energy operations by rescheduling the appliances as per the provision request from the distribution system operator. A two stage HEM optimization frame work was proposed in Kong, Sun, Kong, and Li (2020) to minimize the electricity consumption cost and power fluctuations. A non cooperative based energy management model was proposed in Atzeni, Ordóñez, Scutari, Palomar, and Fonollosa (2012) for multiple smart homes environment with the consideration of distributed energy generation and storage. In Shakouri and Kazemi (2017a), an intelligent residential energy management model was proposed to minimize the peak load demand and overall operating cost. A home appliance scheduling problem is addressed in Yahia and Pradhan (2020), the proposed problem is developed as a multi-objective mixed integer linear programming model to minimize the peak load demand, overall operating cost, and inconvenience of appliance scheduling. A multi-objective dynamic framework was proposed in Mansouri, Nematbakhsh, Ahmarinejad, et al. (2022) for hybrid energy hub designing with the integration of demand response program and power-gas technology to minimize the total cost, co2 emissions, and to improve the efficiency of converter. In Mansouri, Ahmarinejad, Nematbakhsh, et al. (2022), a two stage sustainable framework was proposed for energy management of active distribution systems to improve the user comfort level index and reduce the overall operating cost. A risk based bi-level bidding system is proposed in Mansouri, Nematbakhsh, et al. (2022) to reduce the market clearing price and improve the consumer comfort index. A novel stochastic scheduling model for smarthomes was proposed in Tostado-Véliz, Rezaee Jordehi, Icaza, Mansouri, and Jurado (2023) to minimize the consumed energy electricity bill. In Fatemi, Ketabi, and Mansouri (2023), a four-stage stochastic model for scheduling of smart buildings was proposed to improve the economic and technical indicators of network. Some of the literature works have also proposed effective HEM models with the neighbourhood energy sharing to maximize the locally generated renewable energy utilization within neighbourhood community as well as for better economical benefits. A neighbourhood energy management model was proposed in Taşcıkaraoğlu (2018) to use the shared energy storage system for economic benefits of smart home consumers. Both technical and economic benefits of load-serving entities were also investigated in this model. In Rashid et al. (2020), a cost-effective power sharing technique was proposed for smart grid communities, and also analysed the benefits of optimal power sharing of available RER and battery energy within the smart grid communities. A coordinated energy management model was proposed in Celik et al. (2016) for neighbourhood smart homes to decrease the electricity bill by increasing the usage of local renewable energy. There are many economic and technical benefits to the smart home consumers and utilities with the trading of excess RER energy within the neighbourhood community. In this paper, a centralized coordinated energy management model is proposed for neighbourhood smart homes with local energy trading between the smart homes in neighbourhood community. This model mainly targets to minimize the aggregated electricity bill of all smart home consumers by enhancing the RER energy utilization within the neighbourhood area with the help of the neighbourhood-power sharing concept. A group of ten smart homes are considered as a neighbourhood community in this model and all homes are integrated with different level of solar power, wind power, and battery capacities. The proposed neighbourhood energy management scheme is developed with the help of particle swarm optimization algorithm. The contributions of this paper are summarized as follows: 1. The centralized neighbourhood energy management model is proposed in this paper to maximize the utilization of localized renewable energy production. 2. The minimization of total electricity cost of all neighbourhood smart homes has considered as a primary objective. 3. The practical and complex constraints of all smart home controllable appliances are included in the proposed energy management model. 4. The energy transactions among the neighbourhood smart homes, and between the smart home and grid are effectively addressed in this paper with the help of suitable constraints and pricing scheme. 5. A neighbourhood community with a group of ten smart homes are considered as test system in this paper to evaluate the performance of proposed model. All smart homes are installed with various RER energy capacities, which reflects the practical test system. 6. Three different home energy management control schemes are implemented in this paper to show the effectiveness and benefits of the proposed neighbourhood energy-sharing model. 7. Finally, the capital investment benefits of all the smart home consumers in the neighbourhood area are investigated with the help of economic analysis tool. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 gives the brief description of system model. Section 3 presents the mathematical formulation of proposed model. The test system data is presented in Section 4. Section 5 shows the simulation results and the conclusion of the paper is given in Section 6. 2 System model In this neighbourhood system model (Celik et al., 2016), a group of smart home consumers are connected to a one utility company in the electrical network is considered as a neighbourhood community area. All the homes in this area connected with an advancing metering and communication infrastructure, and which are coordinated through an aggregator. 2.1 Smart home energy system The smart homes in this model are capable of generating as well as storing of electrical energy based on the availability of in-house power generation and home load requirements. In this model, the aggregator coordinates with the all home agents for energy sharing among the community houses. There is no direct contact between the houses because of their data privacy. The essential role of home agents is to control and implement the energy operations of available resources and loads in a smart home. These energy operations are executed with the help of information provided by the aggregator. The energy resources such as solar PV units, wind turbine and battery storage system may not be available in all smart homes in the neighbourhood area due to their space and financial constraints. Each smart home consists of different types of smart home appliances, and they are mainly classified into three categories such as non-shifting appliances (NSAs), time-shifting appliances (TSAs), and power-shifting appliances (PSAs) depending on their inherent operating characteristics. In this model, it is considered that each smart home is equipped with thirteen appliances, where three appliances are PSAs, four appliances are TSAs, and remaining six appliances are NSAs. Each appliance\u2019s operation is modelled with suitable constraints by using the desirable start and end operating time according to consumer choice. The typical structure of smart home energy management system along with home agent and aggregator is shown Fig. 1. 2.2 Neighbourhood structure The neighbourhood structure with power and communication links is depicted in Fig. 2. The power lines are arranged between the utility grid and all the smart homes to exchange the power, and the communication link is connected between the aggregator and all smart home agents for exchange of information. The bi-directional communication and power flow is possible in this model with the help of advanced information, communication and metering technologies. The aggregator manages energy control of all smart homes in neighbourhood area for the better energy management. The primary objective of the aggregator is to determine the aggregated neighbourhood power profile by collecting the electricity profiles of all smart homes in the neighbourhood area with help of home agents, and send the final aggregated information and price data back to all neighbourhood houses through home agents. 2.3 Electricity pricing scheme In this model, the combination of time of use (ToU) pricing ( γ c t ), Feed-in tariff ( γ FIT ) and incentives ( γ I ) are considered to encourage the energy sharing between smart homes within the neighbourhood area. In the ToU pricing scheme, the high prices at peak hours and low prices at the off and mid-peak hours, which help the utility companies to minimize their peak load demand by enabling consumers to shift their appliances operation from peak hours to off-peak hours. The Feed-in tariff (FIT) is used in this model to calculate the cost benefit of smart homes to sell their extra RER energy to the main grid. Here, the FIT value is higher than ToU pricing values, which encourages the consumers to install more RERs at the smart home level. The incentive pricing scheme is also included in this model to maximize the self energy consumption within smart home and also to encourage the energy sharing between smart homes within the neighbourhood community. If a smart home uses its in-house RER and battery stored power for the self consumption, instead of selling to the main grid, it earns the extra benefits, i.e., γ F I T ＋ γ I − γ c t . Similarly, the smart home consumer can be benefited with the price value of γ F I T ＋ γ I for sharing their energy to neighbourhood homes instead of directly feed to the main grid, and the purchased energy price from the neighbourhood homes is γ c t − γ I . The pricing values of various scenarios are provided in Fig. 3. 3 Mathematical problem formulation Let consider a set of smart homes n = [ 1 , \u2026 , N ] are existed in the neighbourhood area, where N denotes the total number of neighbourhood smart homes. The time horizon of load demand profile in a day is given by t = [ 1 , \u2026 , T ] . The each n th smart home has different types of home appliances A ( n ) = { A nsa ( n ) , A psa ( n ) , A tsa ( n ) } , where A nsa ( n ) = { 1 , \u2026 , N s } , A psa ( n ) = { 1 , \u2026 , P s } , and A tsa ( n ) = { 1 , \u2026 , T s } are set of NSAs, PSAs and TSAs, respectively. 3.1 Load-shifting constraints The load-shifting constraints of different smart home appliances are presented in this section (Mesarić & Krajcar, 2015; Shakouri & Kazemi, 2017b). Let N s , T s , and P s are the total number of NSAs, TSAs and PSAs available in smart home n . For non-shiftable appliances, the power requirement is fixed for a particular time period from start time ( t s ) to end time ( t e ). So, there are no load shifting constraints for NSAs. Now the total set of shiftable appliances available in smart home n are (1) A s , n = { 1 , 2 , \u2026 , T s , \u2026 , T s + P s } . The daily power consumption of each appliance a ϵ A s , n is given by (2) x a = [ x a 1 , \u2026 , x a T ] , ∀ a ϵ A s , n . where x a t is the power consumption of appliance a in time t. The energy consumption of each appliance in a day should be within the corresponding operating time limits, which are preferred by the consumers. The mathematical expression of these constraints are given as follows: (3) ∑ t = t s t e x a t ⋅ τ = e a ; t s , t e ϵ { 1 , 2 , \u2026 , T } , ∀ a ϵ A s , n . where τ is each time interval value in hours τ =1 h. The power consumption pattern of each TSA can be selected from the shifted pattern matrix ( P a , tsa t o t a l ) and binary integer vector ( U a , tsa ). (4) x a = U a , tsa P a , tsa t o t a l , ∀ a ϵ { 1 , 2 , \u2026 , T s } where (5) P a , tsa t o t a l = p a 1 p a T ⋯ p a 3 p a 2 p a 2 p a 1 ⋯ p a 4 p a 3 ⋮ ⋮ ⋱ ⋮ ⋮ p a T p a T − 1 ⋯ p a 2 p a 1 (6) U a , tsa = [ u a 1 , u a 2 , \u2026 , u a T ] (7) ∑ t = 1 T u a t = 1 , u a t ϵ { 0 , 1 } . In the load shifting process at any time instant t , the power consumption of each PSA can be adjusted within their specified allowable limits. (8) p a min ≤ x a t ≤ p a max , ∀ a ϵ { 1 , 2 , \u2026 , P s } . The total power consumption of n th smart home P c ( n , t ) at time instant t is given by (9) P c ( n , t ) = ∑ a ϵ A ( n ) x a t The above-mentioned constraints from Eq. (1) to Eq. (9) are the practical complex constraints of TSAs and PSAs in the load-shifting process. After completion of the load-shifting process, the updated power consumption value of n th smart home is calculated by using Eq. (9). This load-shifting process is incorporated in the proposed centralized home energy management model for better optimal power management in the neighbourhood community. 3.2 Solar PV unit The rooftop solar PV units are installed in the some of smart homes in the neighbourhood area. The output power equation of solar PV unit is given by (10) P pv ( n , t ) = N s ( n ) . N p ( n ) . P stc ( n ) . ( I ( t ) / I st ) where N s ( n ) and N p ( n ) are the number of series and parallel connected PV modules, respectively. P stc ( n ) is the maximum power generated by PV module at the standard irradiation ( I st ) value. I ( t ) is the irradiance value at time instant t . 3.3 Wind turbine unit The small wind turbine (WT) units are also installed at the household level for in-house RER energy generation. In this model, it is also considered that some of the neighbourhood smart homes are installed with small wind turbine units. The output of wind turbine unit is calculated by: (11) P wt ( n , t ) = 0 ; if V t < V ci , V f > V co P rated ; if V r ≤ V t ≤ V co P rated × V t − V ci V r − V ci ; if V ci ≤ V t ≤ V r . where, V r is rated wind speed, V ci is cut-in speed, V co is cut-off speed, V t is forecasted wind speed at time t , P rated is the rated power output of the wind turbine unit. 3.4 Battery energy storage system The installation of battery energy storage systems (BESS) in a smart home opens up better opportunities for the effective energy management. In this model, the home agents can decide the optimal operation of BESS based on the available in-house RER energy and load demand. In addition, the home agents can sell extra RER energy and stored battery energy to other entities for maximizing their profit margins after satisfying the house load demand. The BESS operational constraints are formulated as follows: The charging/discharging operation of the BESS is mainly depending on the state of charge (SOC) level and load demand requirements. The mathematical formulation of charging and discharging modes are given in Eqs. (12) and (13). 3.4.1 Charging mode (12) P b ( n , t ) = 0 , SOC b ( n , t ) ≥ SOC max ( n ) P b ( n , t ) , P b ( n , t ) < P max ch ( n ) , SOC b ( n , t ) < SOC m a x ( n ) P max ch ( n ) , P b ( n , t ) ≥ P max ch ( n ) , SOC b ( n , t ) < SOC m a x ( n ) 3.4.2 Discharging mode (13) P b ( n , t ) = 0 , SOC b ( n , t ) ≤ SOC m i n ( n ) P b ( n , t ) , P b ( n , t ) > P max dch ( n ) , SOC b ( n , t ) > SOC m i n ( n ) P max dch ( n ) , P b ( n , t ) ≤ P max dch ( n ) , SOC b ( n , t ) > SOC m i n ( n ) where, P max ch ( n ) and P max dch ( n ) are th maximum charging and discharging powers of n th smart home BESS. Similarly, SOC m i n ( n ) and SOC m i n ( n ) are the minimum and maximum SOC limits of BESS. 3.5 Smart home energy management control schemes 3.5.1 Baseline operation This is the simple energy control model for smart home energy operations. In this case, there is no load-shifting process incorporated, means there is no load adjustment in the smart home during peak and off-peak hours according to price signal. The home energy management operations in this model can be done as per the availability of BESS. (A) Smart homes installed with BESS: In this scenario, the charging operation of BESS only happens when the smart home has the excess in-house RER power after meeting the load demand. Further, the remaining extra RER power can be feeded to the main grid. If the home load demand is greater than the RER output power, the BESS will discharge the power to satisfy the load demand in the smart home. (B) Smart homes without BESS: The extra smart home in-house RER power directly feed to the main grid in this scenario. The overall daily electricity consumption cost of n th smart home is given by (14) c ( n ) = ∑ t = 1 T ( P net ( n , t ) ∗ ( γ c t ) − P s ( n , t ) ∗ ( γ FIT ) − P sc ( n , t ) ∗ ( γ FIT + γ I − γ c t ) ) ∗ τ . where, the total net power consumption of n th smart home at time instant t is calculated by (15) P net ( n , t ) = P c ( n , t ) + P b ( n , t ) − P pv ( n , t ) − P wt ( t ) (16) P net ( n , t ) = P net ( n , t ) P net ( n , t ) > 0 0 P net ( n , t ) ≤ 0 The total self-consumption power and total surplus RER generated power of the smart home are decide by as follows: (17) P s ( n , t ) = 0 P net ( n , t ) > 0 P net ( n , t ) ( − 1 ) P net ( n , t ) ≤ 0 (18) P sc ( n , t ) = P c ( n , t ) − P net ( n , t ) where, P s ( n , t ) and P sc ( n , t ) are the total surplus RER generated power and total self-consumption power of n th smart home at time instant t , respectively. In this baseline operation, each smart home\u2019s daily energy consumption cost is determined by using Eq. (14). In this control scheme, the house load demand is not adjusted but the battery operations are profoundly executed to minimize the daily energy cost. 3.5.2 Centralized home energy management without neighbourhood power sharing In this section, a centralized home energy management scheme is employed without considering the neighbourhood power sharing model. Based on all smart home consumers\u2019 operating time preferences and price signal, the central controller can generate the optimal scheduling of all smart home appliances and battery operations. The aggregator transfers the optimal scheduling details to all home agents and each home agent can implement the scheduled operations in their respective smart homes. In this case, the home agents do not have any information about the neighbourhood home energy activities. Hence, there is no energy exchange between the smart homes in the neighbourhood area. In this scheme, the primary objective is minimization of total energy cost ( C total ) in the neighbourhood area. The mathematical formulation of objective function is given by (19) min C total = ∑ n = 1 N ∑ t = 1 T ( P net ( n , t ) ∗ ( γ c t ) − P s ( n , t ) ∗ ( γ FIT ) − P sc ( n , t ) ∗ ( γ FIT + γ I − γ c t ) ) ∗ τ . In this energy management scheme, the objective function in Eq.(19), i.e the total aggregated energy cost of all smart homes in the neighbourhood community is minimized with the help of the PSO algorithm. The load adjustment of all smart home appliances are incorporated in this model, which means the optimal operation scheduling of all appliances are generated based on their start and end operating time limits. The energy transactions between the neighbourhood smart homes are not considered in this scheme, the extra RER energy is directly feeded to the main grid. 3.5.3 Coordinated centralized home energy management with neighbourhood power sharing The neighbourhood power sharing concept is incorporated in this energy management scheme. In this model, the aggregator agent also shares the aggregated neighbourhood power profile to all home agents to optimize the overall energy cost as well as maximize the RER energy utilization within neighbourhood area. The centralized controller optimizes the scheduling of all home appliance and also decides the neighbourhood power exchange operations based on the overall cost minimization objective. The output optimal operations are implemented with the help of aggregator and all home agents. The mathematical formulation of total energy cost of neighbourhood area is given by (20) min C total = ∑ n = 1 N ∑ t = 1 T P fnet ( n , t ) ∗ ( γ c t ) − P sf ( n , t ) ∗ γ FIT + P purchased ( n , t ) ( ( γ c t ) − γ I ) − P sc ( n , t ) ∗ ( γ FIT + γ I − γ c t ) − P sold ( n , t ) ( ( γ FIT ) + ( γ I ) ) ∗ τ . where, P purchased ( n , t ) and P sold ( n , t ) are the amount of purchased and sold power by n th smart home from neighbourhood area at time instant t . P fnet ( n , t ) and P sf ( n , t ) are the final net power and final surplus power of n th smart home after neighbourhood power exchange process, respectively. The net power requirement and the availability of extra RER power details of all the smart homes are collected by aggregator agent. Thereafter, the following details are evaluated and shared to all the home agents for the neighbourhood power exchange process. The aggregated neighbourhood net power requirement ( P anet ( t ) ) and aggregated neighbourhood surplus power ( P asurp ( t ) ) details are calculated by (21) P anet ( t ) = ∑ n = 1 N P net ( n , t ) (22) P asurp ( t ) = ∑ n = 1 N P s ( n , t ) The neighbourhood purchased/sold power values of n th smart home is computed by (23) P purchase ( n , t ) = ( P asurp ( t ) ∗ ( P net ( n , t ) / P anet ( t ) ) ) P net ( n , t ) > 0 ; P anet ( t ) > P asurp ( t ) P net ( n , t ) P net ( n , t ) > 0 ; P anet ( t ) < P asurp ( t ) 0 otherwise (24) P sold ( n , t ) = P s ( n , t ) P s ( n , t ) > 0 ; P anet ( t ) > P asurp ( t ) ( P anet ( t ) ∗ ( P s ( n , t ) / P asurp ( t ) ) ) P s ( n , t ) > 0 ; P anet ( t ) < P asurp ( t ) 0 otherwise The final net power and surplus power values of n th smart home is determined by (25) P fnet ( n , t ) = P c ( n , t ) + P b ( n , t ) − P pv ( n , t ) − P wt ( t ) − P purchased ( n , t ) + P sold ( n , t ) . (26) P fnet ( n , t ) = P fnet ( n , t ) P fnet ( n , t ) > 0 0 P fnet ( n , t ) ≤ 0 (27) P sf ( n , t ) = 0 P fnet ( n , t ) > 0 P fnet ( n , t ) ( − 1 ) P fnet ( n , t ) ≤ 0 This scheme is the proposed centralized energy management with a neighbourhood power-sharing model. The objective function in Eq. (20), i.e the total aggregated energy cost of all smart homes in the neighbourhood community is minimized with the help of the PSO algorithm. The load-shifting process along with neighbourhood energy transactions are incorporated in this model for better economic benefits for the neighbourhood community area and also this model improves the local RER energy utilization. 3.5.4 Particle swarm optimization algorithm The particle swarm optimization (PSO) method is a well-known naturally inspired swarm-based evolutionary computational algorithm(Kennedy & Eberhart, 1995). In this algorithm, every swarm particle comprises the controllable variables that move with an appropriate velocity in the m-dimensional search space to achieve the optimal objective value. Each swarm particle i has a velocity vector V i and a position vector X i with m dimensions, where V i is represented as [ v i 1 , v i 2 , \u2026 , v i m ] and X i is represented as [ x i 1 , x i 2 , \u2026 , x i m ] . To initiate the PSO approach, V i and X i are generated randomly. Then, the positions and velocities of swarm particles are updated in each iteration as follows (28) ϑ i m k + 1 = ω k ∗ ϑ i m k + C 1 ∗ rand ( ) 1 ∗ ( Pbest i m k − χ i m k ) + C 2 ∗ rand ( ) 2 ∗ ( Gbest k − χ i m k ) , (29) χ i m k + 1 = χ i m k + ϑ i m k + 1 . where ϑ i m k + 1 and χ i m k + 1 are the i th particle updated velocity and position vectors at the ( k + 1 ) t h iteration respectively. C 1 and C 2 are the acceleration coefficients corresponds to cognitive and social components. ω k is the inertia weight used to balance the trade-off between local exploitation and global exploration parameters. r 1 , r 2 are random values generated within the interval [ 0 , 1 ] . In this paper, the proposed coordinated centralized home energy management schemes are implemented with the help of the PSO algorithm. 4 Simulation test system data A group of ten smart homes are considered as a neighbourhood community area in this work to test the performance of the proposed model. It is assumed that the smart homes are installed with various distributed energy resources such as solar PV unit, WT unit and BESS. The installation status details of RERs and BESS are given in Table 1. From Table 1, it is clearly observed that two smart homes are equipped with a PV unit, WT, and battery, next two houses are only equipped with WT and battery, the another two homes are installed only with PV and battery, and the remaining four houses are not integrated with any distributed energy sources. In this model, it is considered that the smart homes are installed with 2 kW rating of PV unit, 1 kW rating of WT unit, and 10 kWh rating of BESS based on their installation status. All smart homes are equipped with different types of controllable and non-controllable home appliances. In this model, the smart home consumers\u2019 appliances are categorized into three groups according to their power ratings. The different home appliances of all consumers and their power ratings are given in Table 2. The combination of various pricing schemes are followed in this model to calculate the consumers\u2019 energy bill. The pricing details of different scheme are listed in Table 3. 5 Simulation result analysis The performance and effectiveness of the proposed neighbourhood energy management model has been evaluated in this section with the help of three different case studies. The case studies are given as follows Case 1: Baseline operation Case 2: Centralized HEM model without neighbourhood power sharing Case 3: Coordinated centralized HEM model with neighbourhood power sharing All the case studies have been simulated using MATLAB R2022a software on intel core i5 laptop with 8 GB RAM. There is no load-shifting process in Case 1 i.e., baseline operation. In this case study, only the battery operation and extra RER power of smart home can be managed according to the consumer\u2019s load demand. The load-shifting scheme is incorporated in both Case 2 and Case 3. The main difference between Case 2 and Case 3 is consideration of the neighbourhood power sharing concept. Case 2 is the centralized energy management model for neighbourhood area without neighbourhood power sharing process, and Case 3 is the proposed coordinated centralized energy management model for neighbourhood area with neighbourhood power sharing. The minimization of overall neighbourhood energy cost is the primary objective for the both Case 2 and Case 3. The simulation results of all the case studies are tabulated in Table 4. From the Table 4, it is noted that the following primary observations a. The energy bills of all the smart home consumers are drastically reduced in all three case studies when compared to the without in-house RER energy integration. b. The overall energy cost of neighbourhood smart home consumers improves 51.98% in Case 2, and 56.23% in Case 3 when compared to Case 1, i.e., baseline operation, because of the involvement of load shifting concept. c. Further, the Case 3 results are better than Case 2 results because of neighbourhood energy sharing model. The electricity bills of all smart homes in three different case studies are compared in Fig. 4. From Fig. 4, it is clearly observed that the energy bills of smart homes 7, 8, 9, and 10 are reduced in both Case 2 and Case 3 when compared to the Case 1 though those homes are not equipped with any of the DERs. The main reason for the reduction in their energy bills is incorporation of load-shifting and neighbourhood modelling in Case 2 and Case 3, respectively. The neighbourhood aggregated energy transactions of all smart homes in a day are presented in Fig. 5. The smart homes 1, 2, 3 and 4 sold the energy of 7.26 kWh, 8.32 kWh, 3.14 kWh and 3.83 kWh, respectively to the neighbourhood smart homes due to the availability of surplus RER energy. The remaining smart homes are purchasing the energy from the neighbourhood homes because of their high load demand and low/no RER capacity. The Fig. 6 represents the energy transactions between the smart homes and grid in a day for Case 2 and Case 3. Most of the smart homes are reduced their imported energy from the grid in Case 3 because of the neighbourhood energy sharing model. From the overall result analysis, it is clearly noticed that the neighbourhood power-sharing model can improve the energy bills of all smart homes in the neighbourhood area and also maximizes the locally generated RER energy utilization. Further, the benefits of financial investment on in-house RERs and battery system are analysed in the following section. 6 Economic analysis The investment benefits are usually assessed with the help of net present value (NPV) and cash payback period (CPP) (Arun & Selvan, 2017b). The CPP analysis of investment on RERs, battery, and other smart home components are determined in this section. In this model, the project life time is 20 years and discount rate is 6% considered, respectively. The initial investment, operating, maintenance, and replacement cost of all the DERs, other smart home components are taken from Lokeshgupta and Sivasubramani (2019). The daily profits of all neighbourhood smart home consumers due to in-house RER and battery integration are given in Table 5. Because of the in-house RER and battery integration the smart home consumers are able to get the significant financial benefits in all case studies. However, the higher profits are attained in Case 3 due to the combination of load-shifting and neighbourhood power sharing model. From this economic analysis, it is clearly noticed that with the proposed model the annual profits of all smart homes in the neighbourhood area are improved by 54.48% for SH1, 59.88% for SH2, 85.03% for SH3, 41.55% for SH4, 30.68% for SH5, and 34.70% for SH6 respectively when compared to without neighbourhood energy sharing concept. The CPP analysis is done in this section to investigate the long term financial benefits of all neighbourhood smart home consumers. The corresponding analysis results are presented in Table 6. Similarly, the final profits after 20 years are shown in Fig. 7. The consumers able to get the better profits in Case 2 and Case 3 when compared to the Case 1 due to the load-shifting model. The best CPP and profit values are obtained in Case 3 when compared to Case 2 because of the neighbourhood power sharing model. From this CPP analysis, it is clearly observed that most of the neighbourhood smart home consumers can get their RER and battery investments within 2.5 years due to the combination of load-shifting and neighbourhood power sharing model. 7 Conclusion In this paper, a centralized coordinated neighbourhood power-sharing model is proposed for the neighbourhood smart home energy management. In this proposed model, the smart home consumers in the neighbourhood area can act as consumer or producer based on the availability of in-house RER power generation. The main aim of the proposed neighbourhood power sharing model is to maximize the local RER energy utilization, minimizing the electricity bills of all smart homes, and reduce the imported energy from the main grid. The combination of different pricing schemes such as ToU, FIT and incentive scheme are considered in this paper to evaluate the benefits of the proposed model. The simulation results have been carried out for three different case studies to show the effectiveness of proposed neighbourhood power sharing model. From the overall results analysis, it is concluded that the electricity bills of all smart home consumers are significantly reduced with the neighbourhood power sharing concept. It is observed that all smart homes together get 56.23% of cost savings in a day with the proposed model when compared to the baseline model. Further, the long term financial benefits of all smart home consumers\u2019 RER and battery investments have been investigated with help of proper economic analysis tool. This analysis also clearly shows that most of the neighbourhood smart home consumers can get their RER and battery investments within 2.5 years with the proposed scheme.

        "dc:description": "This paper presents a centralized neighbourhood energy management with coordinated smart home energy-sharing model for neighbourhood smart homes, which are integrated with in-house renewable energy resources and energy storage systems. The main aim of this neighbourhood energy management model is to minimize the aggregated electricity bill of all smart home consumers in the neighbourhood area by increasing the utilization of local renewable energy generation. The effective combination of time of use pricing, feed-in-tariff scheme and fixed incentive method is considered in this model to encourage the more electricity transactions among the neighbourhood smart homes. A group of ten smart homes with different level of renewable energy integration and load profiles is considered as a test system to determine the performance of the proposed neighbourhood smart home energy management model. The simulation results show that the centralized neighbourhood coordinated smart home energy management model can provide significant economic benefits to all smart home consumers in the neighbourhood area, when compared to the without neighbourhood power-sharing case. From the results, it is noted that all smart homes together get 56.23% of cost savings in a day with the proposed model when compared to the baseline model. Finally, an economic analysis has also done in this paper to investigate the capital investment benefits of all smart home consumers in neighbourhood area. From the economic analysis, it is clearly noticed that with the proposed model the annual profits of all smart homes (SHs) in the neighbourhood area are improved by 54.48% for SH1, 59.88% for SH2, 85.03% for SH3, 41.55% for SH4, 30.68% for SH5, and 34.70% for SH6 respectively when compared to without neighbourhood energy sharing concept.",
