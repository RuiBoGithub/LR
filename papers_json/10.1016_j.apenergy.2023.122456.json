Citizen Energy Communities (CECs) have emerged as a promising solution with numerous benefits for society. CECs have contributed to a higher adoption rate of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs). However, the variable power generation of DERs is a critical challenge, resulting in an increase in the ramp rate of the system's net load. To address this challenge, this paper introduces a unique robust optimization model that utilizes the flexibility constraint to limit the ramp rate of power trading CECs with the upstream grid and assesses the impact of flexibility limits on energy costs. Moreover, two primary goals of CECs are to ensure the prosumer's comfort, which includes thermal comfort, and to achieve self-sufficiency in their energy supply. In this context, this paper uses the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) index to calculate the thermal comfort of prosumers. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis has been conducted on CECs self-sufficiency. Moreover, a robust optimization approach is utilized to consider the uncertainty in upstream energy prices. The results indicate that the Community Energy Storage (CES) leads to a 34.6% reduction in operation cost. Additionally, the inclusion of CES in CECs allows the Energy Community Manager (ECM) to reduce curtailment power to prosumers by 602.98 kW during their engagement in the self-sufficiency program.

interesting solution to tackle the complexities of transitioning toward a sustainable and decentralized energy system [1]. By actively involving prosumers, who both produce and consume energy, CECs promise to enhance energy efficiency, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and foster social unity among communities [2]. CECs have resulted in higher adoption of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs), including Photovoltaic (PV) systems, wind turbines, and battery storage systems by prosumers [3]. The variable power generation of PV systems, while beneficial for power systems, can lead to increased ramp rates in the net load. In this regard, new strategies are required that reduce the negative impacts of the growing adoption of DERs, which significantly impacts the overall net load of CEC [4]. For this reason, the upstream grid operator establishes a maximum limit on the ramp rate to ensure that the power exchange ramp rate with the grid remains below this threshold [5]. This limit is introduced as the flexibility constraint which has an impact on the cost of CEC energy management. Furthermore, prosumer comfort is a crucial parameter in the establishment of CECs [6]. One aspect of prosumer comfort relates to thermal comfort, which the Energy Community Manager (ECM) strives to achieve. This endeavor leads to the comfort and satisfaction of the prosumers participating in CECs. Also, CECs can facilitate an ideal environment for energy sharing among prosumers, allowing participants to share surplus energy. This fosters cooperation and self-sufficiency while maximizing the utilization of clean energy resources [7]. Moreover, one of the fundamental objectives of CECs is to achieve self-sufficiency in their energy supply [8]. For this reason, in the introduced CECs, factors such as energy storage, load curtailment, and rooftop PV generation have been taken into account. These factors have a significant impact on achieving energy self-sufficiency in CECs. On the other hand, energy prices have an uncertain nature, and CECs frequently face significant energy price fluctuations. For this reason, it is necessary to develop a robust approach to optimize the energy management of CECs while considering the uncertainties in upstream energy prices. To the best of available knowledge, no operational framework for CEC implementation has been proposed to date. Such a framework should encompass considerations for flexibility constraints, explore the concept of energy sharing among prosumers, take thermal comfort into account, incorporate robustness against uncertain energy prices, and include a self-sufficiency analysis of CECs. To address these gaps, the development of CECs within an appropriate framework can be beneficial for enhancing both economic and environmental factors. 1.2 Literature review In the last decade, the European Union has made efforts to increase the share of DERs in the energy system. In this regard, the Clean Energy Package (CEP) is a commendable initiative to achieve a greener society, which was published by the European Union. The CEP establishes ambitious targets for the upcoming decades, promoting the involvement of active consumers or prosumers in the CEC structure to facilitate the transition toward a sustainable, low-carbon environment [9]. CECs encompass emerging capabilities that are technologically complex, integrating the assets of consumers, prosumers, and other local entities, such as DER, storage facilities, and electric vehicles. In this regard, some papers such as [10] try to propose a mathematical model for CECs in the distribution energy system. The concept of Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy trading among prosumers in a CEC has been extensively discussed in the literature. [11] introduced a novel optimization model to assess the viability of integrating an Energy Storage System (ESS) within P2P energy trading, while analyzing its impact on financial earnings. [12] presented a unique framework for P2P energy trading that facilitated the participation of solar PV prosumers and consumers in a community co-market facilitated by an energy pawn. Furthermore, the study in [13] employed a leader-follower Stackelberg game to analyze the P2P interactions between microgrids and a utility grid. [14] proposed an innovative approach known as the hierarchical P2P energy management method, which demonstrated a significant reduction in household energy expenses. Previously published papers have acknowledged the need for a complex energy pricing mechanism among prosumers to facilitate P2P energy trading successfully. In this regard, [15] explored the double auction trading method in the simultaneous distribution of thermal and electricity by employing a P2P energy trading mechanism. [16] successfully implemented a reverse auction model specifically designed for P2P energy trading operations. [17] introduced an innovative iterative uniform-price auction mechanism, specifically designed for P2P energy trading between prosumers. Numerous publications have explored the development of an efficient energy pricing platform among prosumers, as evident in the existing literature. It is important to note that determining energy prices in a CEC poses a fundamental challenge. Additionally, all the current approaches available come with substantial implementation costs and infrastructure complexity. In this context, a simpler and more efficient approach entails prosumers sharing excess energy without any self-economic motives, solely to enhance the overall social welfare within the CEC. This energy-sharing method is also consistent with the basic concepts of CEC because, in CEC, the development of the energy community is prioritized over individual development [18] Some papers such as [10,19] address the mentioned way of energy-sharing in the literature. However, the main shortcoming of the mentioned papers is that the total sharing energy for prosumers in a day in the CEC is not equal so the fineness issue may be violated. However, the main drawback of the mentioned papers is that the total participation of prosumers in energy sharing within a day in the CEC is not balanced, which could potentially lead to fairness issues being violated. Furthermore, achieving self-sufficiency in energy systems is a pivotal goal in the pursuit of a greener future. [20] proposed a self-sufficient microgrid considering various energy resources such as wind turbines, PV, wood gasifiers, batteries, and hydrogen energy storage. In addition, [21] presented a heuristic optimization model aimed at enhancing the self-sufficiency of a smart home while taking into account the presence of an electric vehicle. The role of ESSs in enhancing energy system self-sufficiency is substantial. Within this context, the literature suggests two notable configurations: Personal Energy Storage (PES) and Community Energy Storage (CES). In this regard, some research papers such as [22,23] attempted to provide an operational framework for the CESs and PESs in the CECs. On the other hand, the thermal comfort of prosumers is a significant social factor that plays a crucial role in the context of human life. In this regard, [24] proposed an adaptive control strategy for the Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system in the context of the home energy management problem. In [25], the evaluation of the Internet of Things architecture's impact on prosumer thermal comfort in smart homes was conducted. In order to design the HVAC system by considering human comfort, the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) index organized by Fanger's work in the 1960s and 1970s [26], incorporates six key parameters: air temperature, radiation temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, clothing thermal resistance, and activity. It quantitatively assesses thermal comfort in indoor environments and is commonly applied in HVAC systems. In [27], the PMV index is introduced as a measure of thermal social comfort and is utilized for calculating comfort levels using the Enhanced-Interval Optimization Method (EIOM). Also, this optimization method transforms the uncertain constraints into certain conditions. [28] considers the cost of thermal discomfort using the PMV index for thermal comfort assessment. Previous studies have primarily focused on prosumers' thermal comfort at the smart home level, resulting in a significant research gap regarding the influence of this vital factor on the CECs. On the other hand, CECs provide an excellent environment for the development of DERs. However, the uncertain and highly variable nature of DERs, such as Wind and PV, can pose significant challenges to the upstream power system flexibility. In this regard, various flexible energy resources such as ESSs [29], demand response programs [30], and fast ramp power plants [31] are addressed by literature to improve the flexibility of the power system. The proposed solutions require substantial investment or come with high inconvenience costs, making them a challenging issue in the power system. In this context, finding the right solution to address the flexibility of the power system is an important goal. Additionally, the buying and selling prices of energy from the upstream network of the CECs are subject to significant uncertainty, making it crucial to find an appropriate approach for modeling this uncertainty. In this context, [6] employed the scenario-based approach to model the price uncertainty of the upstream network. In [32], the Information Gap Decision Theory (IGDT) is utilized to account for the uncertainty in buying and selling energy prices. In [33], the unscented transformation method was proposed as an approach to address the consideration of energy price uncertainty. Despite the various advantages offered by all uncertainty modeling methods, the robust optimization method is regarded as a stable approach for uncertainty modeling [34]. This method enables the consideration of the system operator's perspective in dealing with uncertainty [35]. The robust optimization approach is utilized in different energy systems problems such as energy hubs [36], home energy management [37], and energy community [38]. Moreover, energy management as an optimization problem can be solved by the two main methods including metaheuristic and classical optimization techniques. The metaheuristic optimization techniques for the energy management problem like hybrid genetic flower pollination algorithm [39], genetic algorithm [40], cuckoo search optimization [41], harmony search algorithm [42], coot bird search algorithm-genetic algorithm [43], whale algorithm [44], butterfly algorithm [45], particle swarm optimization [46] and grasshopper algorithm [47] are commonly used in the energy management problem. However, a fundamental issue with this method lies in its limited accuracy in reaching the global optimal solution. On the other hand, classical optimization methods, capable of achieving absolute optimal solutions, have attracted more attention in recent papers such as [28,48\u201351]. Table 1 provides a summary of the key differences between the proposed model in this paper and the most relevant research studies in the field. In this context, the key gaps in prior studies can be outlined as follows: ❖ Gap #1) While previous references such as [5] have discussed flexibility constraints for implementation in a smart building, this constraint has not been considered in the context of CECs. ❖ Gap #2) Based on the European Union's CEP, prosumer satisfaction plays a significant role in achieving the sustainable development of CECs. To the best of available knowledge, prosumer thermal comfort is not taken into account in the operation of CECs. ❖ Gap #3) The upstream price uncertainty in CECs is one of the significant challenges for ECM. In this context, while robust methods are employed to address uncertainty in energy systems, as indicated by [36\u201338]. However, a robust uncertainty model for CECs has not been addressed by existing research. ❖ Gap #4) Based on the literature, self-sufficiency is addressed as an index in energy system operation, as indicated by [20,21]. However, self-sufficiency is not considered as a structured program in the CEC operation. 1.3 Contributions To address the significant gaps in previous research, this paper presents a novel optimization model that incorporates flexibility constraints for CECs. Additionally, this paper employs a robust optimization approach to account for the uncertain fluctuations in upstream energy prices, ultimately achieving a Pareto optimal balance between cost and robustness. In order to address the prosumers' comfort in the CEC, the thermal comfort of occupants is modeled by the PMV index. Moreover, the level of CEC self-sufficiency is examined for different time intervals, both in the presence of CES and in its absence. The proposed optimization problem is a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem that is solved by the CPLEX solver in the GAMS environment. The fundamental contributions of the paper can be concisely summarized as follows: □ In order to address the first research gap, the flexibility constraint approach is considered: Examining network flexibility and its impact on energy communities is a crucial indicator provided by flexible resources. Flexible resources necessitate expenditure, leading to a general focus on flexibility constraints. Therefore, a flexibility-constraint optimization model for the CEC considering energy sharing, load curtailment, PES, CES, shiftable appliances, and HVAC system is proposed. □ To address the second research gap the PMV index is considered as a part of the objective function to consider the prosumer satisfaction: The prosumer's thermal comfort is precisely regulated through the parameterization of the PMV index, thereby elevating prosumer contentment within the CEC. □ To address the third shortcoming, a robust optimization approach is proposed to model the price uncertainty: To mitigate the undesirable effect of the upstream network price uncertainty, a robust optimization approach has been utilized to characterize the influence of price fluctuations within the CEC. □ To address the fourth shortcoming, a structured program for self-sufficiency is provided: To assess the impacts of one of the primary goals of CECs, which is the promotion of self-sufficiency, an investigation was carried out on the self-sufficiency levels of CECs through a program presentation over various time intervals. 1.4 Paper organization This paper is set out as follows: Section 2 presents the structure of the proposed model and, the proposed optimization model is provided in Section 3. Simulation results are presented in Section 4 and ultimately, Section 5 provides a concise summation of the discoveries made in this paper. 2 The proposed framework In this section, the proposed framework for CECs is described. Fig. 1 depicts the presented framework, which comprehensively encompasses both the physical and managerial layers, enhancing comprehension of the functioning of CECs. In the managerial layer, the system's input data consists of three main components including grid data, prosumer data, and CEC data. The grid data includes information such as electricity prices, input power line capacity limitations, flexibility constraints, and the number of clusters intended for energy community clustering. Additionally, prosumers provide three categories of data. Firstly, there is the energy-sharing attitude, which reflects the prosumer's preferences toward environmental, social, and technological issues in energy sharing. Secondly, the thermal preferences data comprises the prosumer's desired set temperature throughout the day hours. Lastly, the appliance specifications encompass the time intervals during which the prosumer intends to use home appliances, considering shiftability capability. Also, the ECM requires data from the CEC, which includes power consumption information, PV energy generation specifications, as well as energy sharing constraints and rules. Among these rules, the fairness in energy sharing is of paramount importance, as it mandates that each prosumer should receive the same amount of energy, they contribute to the community within the day hours. This rule plays a vital role in enhancing the satisfaction of prosumers with energy-sharing practices. Moreover, data from HVAC systems, PESs, and CESs are collected as part of the input data. The input data, transmitted from the server, plays a crucial role in facilitating the exchange of essential information between the managerial and physical layers. The ECM, acting as a \u201cnon-self-benefit maximizer\u201d or \u201caltruist\u201d efficiently receives and processes data, contributing to optimal energy management and enhancing prosumer comfort within the community. In fact, an altruist is someone who selflessly puts the well-being and interests of others before their own, and they are not driven primarily by personal gain or self-interest. The ECM's main goal is to facilitate efficient energy management and promote fair energy sharing among the participants in the CEC. ECM employs the k-means algorithm to cluster prosumers based on attitude data provided by the subscribers. This clustering process allows the ECM to create cohesive energy sub-communities within the larger CEC. In fact, energy sharing by non-congruent prosumers leads to heavy computational burdens and instability in energy sharing [18]. To address these obstacles, prosumers are divided into sub-communities based on attitudes toward environmental, social, and technological issues, using a machine learning tool called K-Means. This approach ensures that prosumers within a Sub-Community (SC) have similar perspectives, resulting in increased sustainability in energy sharing. The k-means algorithm works by iteratively partitioning prosumers into clusters, where each prosumer is assigned to the cluster with the closest mean value of energy-related attributes. The algorithm aims to minimize the intra-cluster distance while maximizing the inter-cluster distance, ensuring that prosumers with similar attitudes are grouped together. Within these sub-communities, prosumers can interact and share energy resources exclusively with one another. This localized energy sharing fosters a sense of trust and cooperation among prosumers. Prosumers within sub-communities can leverage their collective energy resources to meet their electricity demands in a sustainable manner. This approach also facilitates load balancing and peak demand management, leading to reduced energy wastage and a more stable and resilient CEC. After clustering, the ECM enters the phase of simultaneously operation the energy sub-communities. Additionally, due to the optimization problem being in robust form, the parameter determining the level of uncertainty is set to zero (γ = 0), and then the grid constraints are applied. On the other hand, due to the uncertainty in electricity prices, the ECM takes into account the variability in electricity prices when managing the energy community through robust optimization. The main goal of this optimization process is to minimize the cost of prosumers' electricity bills. Moreover, the ECM places a significant emphasis on ensuring thermal comfort for the prosumers. This is because providing adequate thermal comfort enhances the overall satisfaction and well-being of the prosumers within the energy community. In cases where the required level of thermal comfort is not fully met for the prosumers, the ECM takes proactive measures to address this issue. It offers compensation to the prosumers in the form of a financial cost to make up for the lack of thermal comfort. By doing so, the ECM demonstrates its commitment to meeting the needs and preferences of the prosumers, ensuring their contentment and loyalty within the energy community. Then, the ECM calculates the optimal exploitation process using robust optimization for all γ. On the other hand, in the physical layer, the server serves as an interface for information exchange between the energy community, the ECM, and the grid. Moreover, each energy community is composed of several sub-energy communities that can have either CES or PES. Within an energy sub-community, prosumers possess the capacity to actively engage in energy sharing, thus cultivating a sense of community and promoting sustainable energy practices. Furthermore, each prosumer is outfitted with shiftable household appliances, rooftop PV panels, an HVAC system, and curtailment loads. Additionally, prosumers can exchange energy with the grid. 3 Optimization model In this section, the optimization model related to the robust energy management of the CEC, which is performed by the ECM, has been presented. In the following, the deterministic and robust formulation of the optimization problem are addressed in the first and second subsections, respectively. 3.1 Deterministic model The main purpose of the managerial layer of the proposed framework is to find a solution for energy management that guarantees the minimum energy cost and prosumer discomfort cost. The objective function of this optimization is as follows: (1) min ∑ t = 1 N t π t Buy , G P t Buy , G − π t Sell , G P t Sell , G + ∑ m = 1 N m ∑ t = 1 N t π t Curt P m , t Curt + π TC PMV m , t As observed, the objective function of this optimization problem involves two main components: energy cost and discomfort cost. Specifically, the discomfort cost can be subdivided into power-related and thermal-related dissatisfaction. Power-related discomfort is quantified through the application of the load curtailment concept, which represents a significant element within demand response programs. To assess thermal discomfort, the PMV index is employed, relying on a complex formula that considers diverse environmental and physiological factors outlined in the ISO 7730 standard [52]. This metric predicts the average comfort rating provided by a group of individuals on the comfort scale. This paper uses a simplified version of this index based on [53] as follows: (2) PMV m , t = 2.43 − 376 θ human − θ m , t M R cloth + 0.1 ∀ t ∈ 1 \u2026 N t , ∀ m ∈ 1 \u2026 N m In (2), 2.43, 3.76, and 0.1 are the constant coefficients that are obtained in [53]. Moreover, θ human and θ m , t are the average temperature of human skin in a comfortable state and the indoor temperature for prosumers, respectively. Also, M and R cloth are the human energy metabolism rate and thermal resistance of clothing, respectively. As can be observed from (2), the thermal equilibrium is reached when an individual's internal heat generation matches their heat loss. Maintaining heat balance depends on factors such as the average temperature of human skin in a comfortable state, thermal resistance of clothing, and indoor temperature [54]. In case thermal equilibrium is not maintained, the ECM is required to provide compensation to prosumers for the discomfort penalty they experience. This comprehensive index provides a nuanced understanding of thermal comfort. Moreover, the PMV limitation based on the ISO7730 standard is as follows: (3) PMV min ≤ PMV m , t ≤ PMV max ∀ t ∈ 1 \u2026 N t , ∀ m ∈ 1 \u2026 N m (3) serves as a critical measure for assessing thermal comfort in building environments [52]. Constraints (4) and (5) indicate that the purchased/sold power from/to the grid is equal to the total purchased/sold power of each prosumer, respectively. (4) P t Buy , G = ∑ m = 1 N m P m , t Buy , Pr ∀ t ∈ 1 \u2026 N t (5) P t Sell , G = ∑ m = 1 N m P m , t Sell , P r ∀ t ∈ 1 \u2026 N t The electrical load balance of prosumers as one of the most important constraints is addressed by (6). (6) P m , t Buy , Pr − P m , t Sell , Pr + P m , t PV − ∑ n = 1 N n P m , n , t Share − ∑ s = 1 N s P m , s , t CH − P m , s , t DCH = P m , t L ∀ t ∈ 1 \u2026 N t , ∀ m ∈ 1 \u2026 N m (6) demonstrates the power balance between power consumption and production for each prosumer, which is composed of several components: the amount of power consumption, the power generated by rooftop PV panels, the shared power, and the power charged and discharged by the ESS. The power consumption of consumers is calculated by (7). (7) P m , t L = P m , t BL + P m , t Shift + P m , t C + P m , t H − P m , t Curt ∀ t ∈ 1 \u2026 N t , ∀ m ∈ 1 \u2026 N m The power consumption of each prosumer, as stated in (7), includes the following components: the fixed power consumption of the prosumer, the power consumption of shiftable loads, the HVAC power consumption, and the curtailment loads. The power consumption constraints of the shiftable loads are provided in (8)\u2013(10). (8) P m , t Shift = ∑ a = 1 N a P m , a , t App I m , a , t App ∀ t ∈ 1 \u2026 N t , ∀ m ∈ 1 \u2026 N m (9) I m , a , t App = 1 t start < t < t finish 0 Otherwise (10) ∑ t a s < t < t a f − d a I m , a , t App = 1 ∀ a ∈ 1 \u2026 N a , ∀ m ∈ 1 \u2026 N m Constraints (8) and (9) indicate that shiftable household appliances can be turned on during a specific time interval of the day. Additionally, when a household appliance is turned on, it must remain on for a specific duration as specified by (10). The power-sharing constraints are shown in (11) and (12): (11) P m , n , t Share = − P n , m , t Share ∀ t ∈ 1 \u2026 N t , ∀ m ∈ 1 \u2026 N m , ∀ n ∈ 1 \u2026 N n (12) ∑ t = 1 N t P m , n , t Share = ∑ t = 1 N t P n , m , t Share ∀ m ∈ 1 \u2026 N m , ∀ n ∈ 1 \u2026 N n (11) indicates that in time t th , if prosumer m th delivers power to prosumer n th , prosumer n th receives power from prosumer m th . On the other hand, (12) represents fairness in energy sharing, which means that the daily total shared power received and delivered for each prosumer should be equal. The buying, selling, and sharing energy constraints are addressed by (13)\u2013(18) as follows: (13) P min Buy , G ≤ P t Buy , G ≤ P max Buy , G ∀ t ∈ 1 \u2026 N t (14) P min Sell , G ≤ P t Sell , G ≤ P max Sell , G ∀ t ∈ 1 \u2026 N t (15) I m , t Buy , Pr P min Buy , Pr ≤ P m , t Buy , Pr ≤ I m , t Buy , Pr P max Buy , Pr ∀ t ∈ 1 \u2026 N t , ∀ m ∈ 1 \u2026 N m (16) I m , t Sell , Pr P min Sell , Pr ≤ P m , t Sell , Pr ≤ I m , t Sell , Pr P max Sell , Pr ∀ t ∈ 1 \u2026 N t , ∀ m ∈ 1 \u2026 N m (17) I m , t Buy , Pr + I m , t Sell , Pr ≤ 1 ∀ t ∈ 1 \u2026 N t , ∀ m ∈ 1 \u2026 N m (18) − P max Share < P m , n , t Share < P max Share ∀ t ∈ 1 \u2026 N t , ∀ m ∈ 1 \u2026 N m , ∀ n ∈ 1 \u2026 N n Energy procurement and sales to/from the upstream network for the ECM are constrained by (13) and (14), respectively. Additionally, the energy buying and selling capacities for each prosumer are bounded by (15)\u2013(17), while the shared energy allocation for each prosumer is addressed by (18). The HVAC system constraints are presented in (19)\u2013(25). (19) θ m , t + 1 = e − Δ T CR θ m , t + 1 − e − Δ T CR θ m , t amb − θ m , t T ∀ t ∈ 1 \u2026 N t , ∀ m ∈ 1 \u2026 N m (20) θ m , t T = R η m T P m , t C + P m , t H ∀ t ∈ 1 \u2026 N t , ∀ m ∈ 1 \u2026 N m (21) θ m , t = θ m , t set ∀ t ∈ 1 , ∀ m ∈ 1 \u2026 N m (22) θ m , t set − λ m ≤ θ m , t ≤ θ m , t set + λ m ∀ t ∈ 1 \u2026 N t , ∀ m ∈ 1 \u2026 N m (23) I m , t C P m C , min ≤ P m , t C ≤ I m , t C P m C , max ∀ t ∈ 1 \u2026 N t , ∀ m ∈ 1 \u2026 N m (24) I m , t H P m H , min ≤ P m , t H ≤ I m , t H P m H , max ∀ t ∈ 1 \u2026 N t , ∀ m ∈ 1 \u2026 N m (25) I m , t C + I m , t H ≤ 1 ∀ t ∈ 1 \u2026 N t , ∀ m ∈ 1 \u2026 N m (19) states that the temperature in the next hour is a function of the indoor temperature in the same hour, the ambient temperature, and the temperature that the HVAC system creates. The power consumption of HVAC is also presented in (20). On the other hand, the temperature at the initial hour must be set to the value determined by the prosumer, as stated in (21). The indoor temperature interval is limited by (22). Furthermore, the power consumption constraints of the HVAC system are specified in (23) and (24), where (25) prohibits the HVAC from both cooling and heating operations simultaneously. The ESS constraints are addressed by (26)\u2013(34) as follows: (26) SOC s , t = SOC s , t − 1 + P s , t CH η ESS − P s , t DCH / η ESS ∀ s ∈ 1 \u2026 N s , ∀ t ∈ 1 \u2026 N t (27) P s , t CH = ∑ m = 1 N m P m , s , t CH ∀ s ∈ 1 \u2026 N s , ∀ t ∈ 1 \u2026 N t (28) P s , t DCH = ∑ m = 1 N m P m , s , t DCH ∀ s ∈ 1 \u2026 N s , ∀ t ∈ 1 \u2026 N t (29) SOC s min ≤ SOC s , t ≤ SOC s max ∀ s ∈ 1 \u2026 N s , ∀ t ∈ 1 \u2026 N t (30) P s CH , min ≤ P s , t CH ≤ P s CH , max ∀ s ∈ 1 \u2026 N s , ∀ t ∈ 1 \u2026 N t (31) P s DCH , min ≤ P s , t DCH ≤ P s DCH , max ∀ s ∈ 1 \u2026 N s , ∀ t ∈ 1 \u2026 N t (32) I m , s , t CH P m , s CH , min ≤ P m , s , t CH ≤ I m , s , t CH P m , s CH , max ∀ s ∈ 1 \u2026 N s , ∀ t ∈ 1 \u2026 N t , ∀ m ∈ 1 \u2026 N m (33) I m , s , t DCH P m , s DCH , min ≤ P m , s , t DCH ≤ I m , s , t DCH P m , s DCH , max ∀ s ∈ 1 \u2026 N s , ∀ t ∈ 1 \u2026 N t , ∀ m ∈ 1 \u2026 N m (34) I m , s , t CH + I m , s , t DCH ≤ 1 ∀ s ∈ 1 \u2026 N s , ∀ t ∈ 1 \u2026 N t , ∀ m ∈ 1 \u2026 N m (26) indicates that the State of Charge (SoC) for energy storage in each hour is dependent on the previous hour's SoC and the amount of charging and discharging power in the same hour. Furthermore, (27) and (28) determine the amount of charging and discharging power of the storage system. On the other hand, the limitations on charging and discharging of energy storage, as well as prosumers are presented in constraints (29)\u2013(34). Moreover, (35) represents the flexibility constraint that enhances the flexibility of the upstream energy system. (35) P t Buy , G − P t − 1 Buy , G − P t Sell , G − P t − 1 Sell , G ≤ P Flex ∀ t ∈ 1 \u2026 N t (35) limits the ramp rate at which energy can be bought and sold to and from the upstream grid, serving as a limitation on flexibility. This limitation ensures that the upstream network remains unaffected by fluctuations in power generation from DERs. The nonlinear constraint (35) is linearized by the following constraints: (36) P t Buy , G − P t − 1 Buy , G − P t Sell , G − P t − 1 Sell , G ≤ P Flex ∀ t ∈ 1 \u2026 N t (37) − P t Buy , G − P t − 1 Buy , G − P t Sell , G − P t − 1 Sell , G ≤ P Flex ∀ t ∈ 1 \u2026 N t 3.2 Robust optimization model Employing robust optimization is one of the applicable solutions for addressing the influence of uncertainty on the results of the optimization problem. Remarkably, this approach does not require a probability density function or historical data pertaining to the uncertain event. In the presence of an uncertain variable such as x, (38) is utilized for uncertainty modeling [55]: (38) x ⌢ − x ¯ ≤ x ̂ x ⌢ , x ¯ and x ̂ are the uncertain value of x, predicted value of x, and maximum deviation of actual value from the predicted value of x, respectively. Also, the objective function is defined as z = f x y , where x represents the uncertain variable and y is considered as the known variable. The objective of this problem is to minimize the z , which is represented in (39)\u2013(41). (39) min z (40) z ≥ f x y (41) f x y = A y × x The matrix A y comprises the coefficient elements, denoted as a i y . On the other hand, the function f x y can be divided into two parts: deterministic and uncertain. In dealing with a robust optimization problem, the focus should be on maximizing considerations for worst-case scenarios, as shown in (42)\u2013(44). (42) f x y = A y × x ¯ + max w i ∑ i = 1 N i a i y × x ̂ i × w i (43) 0 ≤ w i ≤ 1 : ξ t (44) ∑ i = 1 N i w i ≤ Γ : β In this context, the coefficient w i is employed to formulate the robust counterpart of the objective function [56]. Moreover, Γ represents the degree of uncertainty. If this parameter is set to zero, it indicates the absence of uncertainty in the problem. When this parameter reaches its maximum value, it signifies that the highest level of uncertainty has been considered. The dual of the second part of (42(−(44) is as follows: (45) min Γ β + ∑ i = 1 N i ξ i (46) β + ξ i ≥ a i y × x ̂ i By substituting the dual, which consists of (45) and (46), into (42), the robust optimization general formulation with the objective of minimizing is written in the form of (47)\u2013(50). (47) min z (48) z ≥ f x y (49) f x y = A y × x ¯ + Γ β + ∑ i = 1 N i ξ i (50) β + ξ i ≥ a i y × x ̂ i In order to employ uncertainty for electricity market prices, utilizing robust optimization, (47)\u2013(50) are incorporated into the deterministic model, resulting in the creation of a new formulation as follows: (51) min cost (52) cost ≥ ∑ t = 1 N t π t Buy , G P t Buy , G − π t Sell , G P t Sell , G + ∑ m = 1 N m ∑ t = 1 N t π t Curt P m , t Curt + π TC PMV m , t + ∑ t = 1 N t cost t Uncertainty (53) cost t Uncertainty = max π ¯ t Buy , G − π t Buy , G 2 P t Buy , G − π ¯ t Sell , G − π t Sell , G 2 P t Sell , G ρ t (54) 0 ≤ ρ t ≤ 1 : ϕ t (55) ∑ t = 1 N t ρ t ≤ γ : φ As observed from (52), the energy cost is composed of two parts including deterministic and uncertain parts. In fact, the core concept of robust optimization is to maximize the impact of the uncertain elements of the problem, while the problem should find the minimum solution encountered with the undesirable uncertain term. In this context, (53) maximizes the uncertainty cost by considering the robust counter ( ρ t ) and average price deviation. Additionally, ρ t is limited between 0 and 1 to ensure the convexity of the problem [57]. Also, the robustness parameter γ adjusts the level of conservatism. Moreover, γ varies between 0 and 24. When γ = 0 , it means the problem is completely deterministic, but when γ = 24 , it implies considering uncertainty throughout all 24 h. To solve the model, the dual of the proposed uncertain model (53)\u2013(55) is formulated as follows: (56) min γφ + ∑ t = 1 N t ϕ t (57) φ + ϕ ≥ π ¯ t Buy , G − π t Buy , G 2 P t Buy , G − π ¯ t Sell , G − π t Sell , G 2 P t Sell , G (58) ϕ t , φ ≥ 0 By substituting the dual into (52), the objective function is rewritten as follows: (59) cos t ≥ ∑ t = 1 N t π t Buy , G P t Buy , G − π t Sell , G P t Sell , G + ∑ m = 1 N m ∑ t = 1 N t π t Curt P m , t Curt + π TC PMV m , t + γφ + ∑ t = 1 N t ϕ t The final robust optimization model is formulated as minimizing (51) while considering the constraints (2)\u2013(37) and (57)\u2013(59). 4 Numerical study In this section, a numerical study is conducted, and the corresponding findings are presented. To assess the performance of the proposed framework, a desktop computer with the following specifications was utilized: an Intel (R) Core (TM) i7-10750H CPU running at 2.60 GHz, paired with 16 gigabytes of RAM. The execution of the K-means algorithm was carried out using MATLAB R2018b, with a runtime of around 3 s, while the resolution of the MILP optimization problem was accomplished using the CPLEX solver within the GAMS environment in 26 s. The details of the computational details are presented in Appendix A. 4.1 Input data To evaluate the precision of the framework's performance, a CEC consisting of 50 prosumers, as represented in Fig. 2 is utilized [58]. The PES of each prosumer is installed at their respective locations. Additionally, it's assumed that the CESs are situated at the Point of Common Coupling (PCC) within the energy community. This assumption aligns with the notion of the small size of the CEC, as stipulated in the CEP of the European Union. Importantly, this assumption doesn't compromise the overall applicability of the proposed energy management framework [8]. Prosumers have fixed and shiftable loads while the aggregated baseload of prosumers is shown in Fig. 3 . Also, the indoor temperature of prosumers' homes is controlled by an individual HVAC system. Furthermore, each prosumer is equipped with one of four distinct types of photovoltaic systems, as illustrated in Fig. 4 . Prosumers can engage in energy exchange with the upstream grid and also reduce their energy demand to participate in load curtailment demand response programs. Fig. 5 illustrates both the selling and buying prices, as well as the load inconvenience penalty. The buying price of energy from the upstream grid is obtained from the Nord Pool market in the Netherlands [59]. Additionally, it is assumed that the selling price to the upstream grid equates to 50% of the buying energy prices [19]. Moreover, in assessing the adverse effects of load curtailment on prosumer comfort, an inconvenience penalty is presumed to be 50% higher than the buying energy prices [6]. The ambient temperature during the summer for the Netherlands is depicted in Fig. 6 [60]. Moreover, the shiftable household appliance parameters are presented in Table 2 . The prosumers' attitudes within a CEC have been ascertained through a comprehensive questionnaire-based investigation conducted in the Netherlands [18]. This survey aimed to gauge prosumers' perspectives on energy sharing. Prosumers' attitudes were evaluated based on three dimensions: environmental, social, and technological. Within each dimension, prosumers responded to two questions, providing ratings on a scale of 1 to 5. In this research, an aggregate score for prosumers' attitudes, ranging from 1 to 10, was calculated by summing the scores across all domains. Furthermore, the necessary parameters for the optimal operation of this energy community are provided in Table 3 . In this framework, π ¯ t Sell , G and π ¯ t Buy , G are assumed to be 10% of the π t Buy , G . Furthermore, π TC is equal to 0.3 π t Buy , G . 4.2 Numerical result The considerable scale of the CEC, combined with the capacity for all prosumers to exchange energy, leads to a notable escalation in computational demands. To address this challenge, the K-means method is employed to cluster prosumers, leading to the creation of sub-communities within the CEC. The assignment details of prosumers to the four predefined clusters are illustrated in Fig. 7 . Prosumers with similar attitudes are represented by the same color in the figure. Based on the clustering results, the operation model is solved and the results are obtained. Table 4 provides the associated costs of sub-communities under varying conditions. Indeed, as observed in Table 4, the energy cost of the CEC is notably high in the absence of an ESS. Additionally, the results confirm the significant cost reduction contributions of both the CES and the PES systems in minimizing operational costs. However, the comparative analysis demonstrates that the CES system outperforms the PES system by 2.4%, resulting in an enhancement of cost efficiency. Moreover, the comparison between the cost-saving in this paper and [51] shows that the proposed approach is more efficient in the cost-saving aspect. The optimal energy costs obtained from Table 4 could potentially be influenced by uncertainties in upstream energy prices. In light of this, a robust strategy should be chosen by the ECM to safeguard against the impact of upstream energy price uncertainties. The ECM conducts optimization for the robustness of electricity prices for the upcoming day in 24 distinct robustness scenarios. These robustness scenarios, ranging from γ = 0 where no uncertainty is taken into account to γ = 24 where all 24 h are assigned uncertainty, are illustrated in Fig. 8 . Based on Fig. 8, the energy cost within the CEC experiences an increase with the escalation in the number of hours characterized by energy price uncertainties in the day-ahead scheduling problem. The percentage of changes indicates that the cost increases by 3.88%. These results demonstrate that CECs effectively withstand the impacts of electricity price uncertainties. The ECM strives to purchase electricity from the grid during hours when the electricity price is low, resulting in minimal impact on CECs' costs. On the other hand, the energy cost increases up to γ = 10 (10h), and beyond that point, despite the escalation of energy price uncertainties in the subsequent hours, the energy cost remains unchanged. This can be attributed to the number of hours during which energy is purchased. In other hours, due to the presence of solar panel-generated power, there is no further need for grid electricity procurement. Consequently, an increase in prices will not affect the CEC energy costs. On the other hand, one of the significant factors affecting the operational costs of the CEC is the capacity of the flexibility limit ( P Flex ) that is determined by the upstream network. Fig. 9 demonstrates the effect of changes in the flexibility limit on the energy costs of the CEC. As can be seen from Fig. 9, the energy cost is high when the determined flexibility capacity by the upstream network is low. The main reason for this issue is that the ECM is forced to either impose load curtailment on consumers or purchase electricity from the grid during peak price periods. On the other hand, as the flexibility capacity increases, the operational cost decreases until it reaches a capacity of 120 kW. Beyond this capacity, the operational cost remains unaffected because the ECM can readily meet the requisite power demand. In another respect, the increase in energy costs resulting from reduced flexibility necessitates compensation. This compensation can be carried out through the payment of damages by the upstream network operator to the CECs or by addressing this issue through regulatory rules. The CEC energy exchange with the upstream network with CES and PES configurations is shown in Fig. 10 . Results indicate that the ECM procures electricity from the grid during the initial 6 h, as well as in hours 14\u201315 and 18, due to the lower electricity prices during these hours. The purchased power during the initial 6 h is significantly high, attributed to neither solar panel generation nor the discharge of previously charged storage during this period. Moreover, the buying electricity of the CEC from the upstream network is at the lowest level in sunny hours. Based on the obtained results, it's important to highlight that the CEC with the CES system demonstrates a greater degree of self-sufficiency compared to the CEC with the PES system. Due to the CES system, a lower amount of power is purchased from the grid. This advantage becomes particularly prominent when the upstream network is unavailable. On the other hand, according to Table 4, it is observed that the energy cost with the CES system is lower than that with the PES. However, based on Fig. 10, the power sold to the grid in PES mode is higher than the CES. In the PES system, during peak network pricing, each prosumer aims to cover their own energy needs using the PES. Whenever there's extra power, they share it among other prosumers through energy sharing. However, due to the limitation of energy sharing, a fewer number of prosumers can share this surplus power, forcing them to sell the power to the grid at a lower price. In contrast, in the CES system, a large number of prosumers can benefit from the discharged power during these hours. Fig. 11 shows the hourly charging and discharging of the CES system. It is evident from Fig. 11 that, during hours 3 and 4, the ECM charges the CES units by purchasing power from the upstream network, which is then discharged during hours 7 and 8 when electricity prices are high. On the other hand, during sunny hours, CES units are charged using clean solar energy and discharge their stored power during peak load hours and high electricity prices. As a result, prosumers reduce their reliance on grid electricity purchases, and in some cases, they might even have surplus electricity to sell back to the grid. Washing machines, dishwashers, and vacuum cleaners are daily appliances in every household. Therefore, determining the optimal time to use these appliances is crucial. For this reason, the optimal hours for using schedulable household appliances are shown in Fig. 12 . The findings confirm that the most cost-effective time to operate household appliances is during periods of low electricity prices and minimal power consumption. For example, a dishwasher that can be scheduled to run between 9 AM and 5 PM, the optimal time to start it would be around 2 PM, as both electricity demand and the baseload are at their lowest points during that period. The results of dynamic optimal prosumers' energy-sharing in the CEC are shown in Fig. 13 . It's important to highlight that negative values represent imported energy, while positive values represent exported energy within the energy-sharing system. The findings indicate that prosumers take an active and pivotal role in energy-sharing initiatives during peak demand hours when electricity prices soar to their highest levels and solar panels are generating the maximum power output. Furthermore, prosumers exhibit a strong inclination toward energy sharing, particularly when their ESSs are in discharge mode. This outcome leads to efficient energy sharing, enabling prosumers who face power deficits due to storage constraints to fulfill their energy needs through energy exchange. Additionally, the results show that the total energy imported and exported daily within the CEC's energy-sharing scheme is equal, confirming the fairness aspect. The HVAC system plays a crucial role in ensuring the thermal comfort of prosumers. Prosumers 1, 25, 49, and 50 have been randomly selected in Fig. 14 . Additionally, Fig. 15 presents the power consumption of the HVAC system for the selected prosumers. Due to the large number of prosumers, demonstrating the HVAC performance for each isn't feasible. Therefore, the HVAC system performance data is provided in the Appendix B. In accordance with the thermal satisfaction standards defined by the PMV index, the standard or normal temperature is approximately 20 °C. Furthermore, the PMV index can tolerate deviations of up to a 0.5 rate without causing any dissatisfaction among prosumers. In this regard, the findings confirm that the indoor temperatures obtained fall entirely within the predefined satisfaction range of the PMV index. 4.3 Sensitivity analysis In order to demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach, the results of various sensitivity analyses are presented. In this regard, self-sufficiency analysis, and CEC's capacity analysis are conducted in the following subsections. 4.3.1 The self-sufficiency sensitivity analysis The achievement of self-sufficiency within CECs is a paramount objective for a more environmentally friendly future. Consequently, energy system policymakers may contemplate regulatory measures to support this crucial goal. One potentially effective regulation proposed by the upstream regulator involves the voluntary allocation of a 6-h timeframe for CECs to attain self-sufficiency. During this six-hour timeframe, the upstream network operator decreases the penetration rate of the upstream grid to ensure self-sufficiency within the CEC. It's evident that CEC participation in the self-sufficiency program results in an increase in the energy cost for the CEC. Therefore, the upstream network operation should provide compensation as an incentive to counteract this cost increase. The selection of the optimal six-hour timeframe for the ECM to engage in the self-sufficiency program holds great significance. In order to select the optimal timeframe, Figs. 16 and 17 display sensitivity analyses for the self-sufficiency program with and without CES scenarios, respectively. They consider the upstream energy exchange capacity limit as input and the output variables are energy costs and self-sufficiency ratio (SSR). In Figs. 16 and 17, the upstream energy exchange capacity limit, represented as a percentage, indicates the proportion of the default limit for energy exchange with upstream grid. Also, it's worth noting that the SSR index is calculated by the method introduced in [63]. The input and output ranges of the sensitivity analysis parameter are addressed in Table 5 . The cost change percentages for the CES scenario during the first, second, third, and fourth six-hour periods of the day are 30.74%, 0%, 0.71%, and 0.2%, respectively. Additionally, the SSR change percentages for the CES scenario during the first, second, third, and fourth six-hour periods of the day are 27.94%, 0%, 0.11%, and 0.13%, respectively. The results demonstrate that at a high grid penetration rate, the SSR for the CEC with CES is 70.65%. Furthermore, the grid penetration rate has a direct impact on both energy cost and SSR. The findings also indicate that SSR and the energy cost of the CEC remain relatively stable during the second six-hour timeframe, primarily due to the performance of the PV system and the CES. Additionally, the results confirm that a low grid capacity limitation (i.e., lower than 10%) significantly influences both SSR and energy costs. Moreover, based on Fig. 17, the cost change percentages for the without CES scenario during the first, second, third, and fourth six-hour periods of the day are 19.24%, 2.58%, 0.97%, and 29.51%, respectively. Furthermore, the SSR change percentages for the without CES scenario during the first, second, third, and fourth six-hour periods of the day are 26.36%, 2.68%, 2.48%, and 32.43%, respectively. By comparing this scenario with the one involving energy storage, it becomes evident that the level of self-sufficiency is higher in the scenario with energy storage. Furthermore, the presence of energy storage significantly reduces energy management costs within the energy community. The hourly load curtailment and energy cost of the CEC for with/without CES resulting from its involvement in the self-sufficiency program throughout various timeframes of the day are shown in Fig. 18 and Table 6 , respectively. The findings clearly demonstrate that the CES significantly reduces the amount of load curtailment in the CEC. Moreover, the highest load curtailment with and without CES is obtained for the first timeframe of the day. The main reason is that the PV system is not accessible and the CES system has not any charge to help the system to avoid of load curtailment. Consequently, the curtailment power capacity is the same for both conditions, without or with CES, and the CEC heavily depends on the grid, as it has been unable to meet its own load. In the second and third six-hour periods, the curtailment power is lower due to solar panel energy generation compared to the first six-hours. On the other hand, for the case with CES, this value is equal to zero, as the CES can be charged during the initial six-hour period and discharged during the second and third six-hour periods. Additionally, the CES plays a crucial role in meeting energy needs and preventing load curtailment in the last time interval, where high demand is evident and solar panel production is not available. ECM must significantly minimize curtailed load to ensure stability within the CEC due to the absence of storage facilities for discharging energy. Curtailment power causes dissatisfaction among prosumers. Consequently, the ECM is obliged to pay an inconvenience penalty for curtailing power, leading to an increase in the operational costs of the energy community. According to Table 6, the inconvenience cost in the without CES scenario is 187.28 \u20ac. In contrast, in the CES scenario, energy cost decreases to 71.88 \u20ac. This difference signifies a reduction in inconvenience cost by 115.40 \u20ac. This reduction will significantly contribute to improving the CEC costs. Based on this, the ECM chooses the second or third six-hour time interval to participate in the self-sufficiency program because during these hourly periods, they can entirely meet the energy demand of the community, and no costs are incurred for the inconvenience penalty. 4.3.2 The CES's capacity sensitivity analysis The energy cost of the CEC with CES is significantly decreased by considering the higher penetration rate of DERs. CES also improves the adaptability of CECs to mitigate energy price fluctuations, resulting in cost savings and increased self-sufficiency. Changes in CES capacity have a substantial effect on prosumer costs. Notably, adjusting storage capacity proportionally influences both charge and discharge power. The sensitivity analysis of CES capacity is presented in Fig. 19 by considering the CES capacity as an input parameter and the energy cost as an output parameter. The variation rate of the input parameter is 0\u201315 kW and the variation rate of the output parameter is 34.26%. The rationale behind this significant cost variation is that the CES charges during periods of low electricity prices and discharges when the electricity prices increase. Furthermore, increasing storage capacity beyond 12 kWh has no impact on costs, as this capacity can adequately supply the required power for all prosumers. 5 Conclusions This paper introduces a novel framework, both physical and managerial, designed for the efficient management of a sub-community in the CEC. It addresses the crucial need for prosumer thermal comfort within CECs, leveraging the PMV index. Handling inherent uncertainty in upstream energy prices, the paper applies a robust optimization method to shield CECs from fluctuating costs. Exploring the impact of flexibility capacity constraints on operational expenses is another focus. It investigates CECs' involvement in self-sufficiency programs, highlighting potential benefits. The significance of this optimization framework, coupled with extensive analyses, holds pivotal importance in advancing sustainable and eco-friendly energy systems. The key accomplishments of this study include: \u2022 The paper's findings reveal that the CES and the PES exert a notable influence on the operational costs of the CEC, with a respective impact of 34.6% and 32.2%. \u2022 The robust uncertainty results indicate that the upstream price uncertainty can increase the energy cost of the CEC by 3.7%. The low percentage of changes indicates the excellent performance of the CEC in dealing with electricity price uncertainties. \u2022 The analysis performed indicates that the upstream predefined flexibility capacity impacts the operational cost of the CEC. The findings confirm that the flexibility limit reaches saturation at 120 kW, beyond which the energy cost remains unchanged. \u2022 The integration of energy storage solutions emerges as a critical factor in ensuring the success of self-sufficiency initiatives within CECs. By mitigating cost fluctuations and bolstering the reliability of energy supply, energy storage not only enhances the economic feasibility of self-sufficiency but also contributes to a more sustainable and resilient energy future for these communities. \u2022 The presence of CES in CECs enables the ECM to provide 602.98 kW less curtailment power to the prosumers during CECs' participation in the self-sufficiency program. For this reason, the ECM incurs 115.40 \u20ac less inconvenience cost due to the storage system. \u2022 The sensitivity analysis of the CES capacity reveals a 34.26% change in the CEC's energy cost when changing the CES capacity from 0 kW to 15 kW. In this paper, the analysis of CECs focuses on their self-sufficiency, and a sensitivity analysis is carried out to assess the impact of probability on energy costs. In future research, it is recommended to investigate the determination of upstream incentives to encourage the participation of CECs in self-sufficiency and flexibility programs. Moreover, the CES location in the large energy communities as an optimization problem is an interesting research topic for future research.

        "dc:description": "Citizen Energy Communities (CECs) have emerged as a promising solution with numerous benefits for society. CECs have contributed to a higher adoption rate of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs). However, the variable power generation of DERs is a critical challenge, resulting in an increase in the ramp rate of the system's net load. To address this challenge, this paper introduces a unique robust optimization model that utilizes the flexibility constraint to limit the ramp rate of power trading CECs with the upstream grid and assesses the impact of flexibility limits on energy costs. Moreover, two primary goals of CECs are to ensure the prosumer's comfort, which includes thermal comfort, and to achieve self-sufficiency in their energy supply. In this context, this paper uses the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) index to calculate the thermal comfort of prosumers. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis has been conducted on CECs self-sufficiency. Moreover, a robust optimization approach is utilized to consider the uncertainty in upstream energy prices. The results indicate that the Community Energy Storage (CES) leads to a 34.6% reduction in operation cost. Additionally, the inclusion of CES in CECs allows the Energy Community Manager (ECM) to reduce curtailment power to prosumers by 602.98 kW during their engagement in the self-sufficiency program.",
