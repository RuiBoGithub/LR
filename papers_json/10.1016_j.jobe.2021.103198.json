In this work, a global energy saving optimal control strategy is proposed to address the high energy consumption of chilled water pumps caused by the small temperature difference between supply and return water, and the low efficiency of the chillers. The developed control strategy consists of two parts: the group control scheme and an optimal controller for variable water temperature/volume control. The group control scheme coordinates each chiller's operating time based on its running time and the chiller load rate. The optimal controller regulates the chilled water pump frequency according to the chilled water temperature difference and the valve opening at important terminal air conditioning units, and calculates the chilled water supply temperature under optimal comprehensive energy consumption of chillers and pumps. The proposed control strategy is easy to be embedded into the existing control systems of refrigerating stations. This scheme is then applied to the air conditioning system of a large public building in Beijing, China. Experimental results show that the proposed strategy can save up to 63% of energy consumption from the chilled water pumps and 6% from the chillers compared to the original control scheme.

In China, centralized heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems account for 30\u201350% of total building energy consumption [1], and thus reducing the energy consumption of an air conditioning system is a key measure to reduce the overall energy consumed. When an air conditioning system operates, its energy consumption is mainly regulated by a control strategy [2], and thus in recent years, many scholars have studied several optimization control strategies to reduce the energy consumption of air conditioning systems. For air conditioning systems that involve several chillers, optimizing the number of operating chillers is an effective way to reduce their energy consumption. Thus, Huang et al. [3] propose a method to optimize chillier load distributions and determine the number of chillers in operation. The former is optimized by adjusting chiller's sectional critical points, while the latter by adjusting critical points and the set point of the cooling water temperature in the condenser to achieve the lowest energy consumption for all chillers. Seo et al. [4] compare and analyze energy consumption of different chiller control schemes by considering several factors such as, that the majority of the existing chillers operate under partial load conditions, influence of the Part Load Ratio (PLR), and corresponding power consumption depending on the chiller operation mode. From their analysis, they highlight that the chiller operation efficiency can be improved if during the refrigeration season a unified chiller control is utilized, and during the non-refrigeration season a sequential control scheme is employed. Considering the problem that the maximum refrigerating capacity of the chillers varies under actual operating conditions, Liu et al. [5] suggest a control strategy that is based on a branch and bound type of algorithm. In their study, a chiller model and a cooling tower model are built to calculate the maximum cooling capacity of a single chiller. Then the branching definition algorithm is used to formulate chiller ordering control, which reduces the energy consumption of the multi-chiller system. On the other hand, chillers of a refrigerating station system mostly operate under low load conditions, and thus their efficiency is low resulting in serious energy waste. Thus, in recent years, many scholars have performed research on means to reduce energy consumption of the refrigerating station system by improving operating efficiency of chillers under different partial load conditions [6]. For example, Gao [7] highlights that the chilled water supply/return temperature difference of chillers can be improved by properly exploiting cooling coils, control systems, a distribution scheme, and a piping system. Thangavelu et al. [8] indicate that the majority of refrigeration station systems lack an overall system optimization scheme, and thus propose an energy optimization method based on multiple parameters, i.e., cooling load, weather conditions, chilled water and cooling water flow rate, and chilled water supply/return temperature. Their method establishes an energy model for each part of the refrigerating station system considering cooling load and the impact of the weather conditions on the system, and the chiller efficiency, capacity, and cooling load. Their proposed method optimizes the refrigeration station system's overall energy consumption by utilizing a nonlinear programming solver that considers all the model's parameters. Their simulation results demonstrate that this optimization method can reduce overall energy consumption of the system. Deng et al. [9] propose a system optimization method that matches external factors, i.e., chilled water supply/return temperature and pump heads, with internal factors, i.e., the actual energy efficiency of the chilled water pumps. In their work, besides coordinating and matching the internal and external factors, the authors also analyze the performance of the indoor environment and the air system, and optimize the control strategy according to the cooling load demand to avoid excessive supply. Simulation results show that this optimization method can reduce the overall energy consumption of the system and realize energy saving of the chilled water system. Song et al. [10] investigate the energy consumption problem of pumps in air-conditioning systems and suggest a control valve that utilizes a chilled water flow optimization control strategy to control the fan coil unit (FCU) that is equipped with a temperature control valve. This work analyzes and compares different air flows and water temperatures, water supply and return water temperature, and total energy consumption, aiming at ultimately improving the chilled water supply/return temperature difference. Experimental results show that this method can reduce flow rate of the chilled water and lower energy consumption of the pumps on the premise of ensuring the terminal load. However, most current literatures present an optimization control only for one point or part of the refrigeration station system loops, out of several problems that cause high total energy consumption and thus ultimately do not manage to optimize the overall performance. Besides, due to complexity of the control algorithm, the vast majority of current research is performed in simulation without being tested in practical applications. Spurred by the deficiencies of current literatures, this study proposes a group control scheme and an optimal controller for variable water temperature/volume control, and ultimately affords an energy saving system. In a group of chillers that operate based on a control strategy, the total operating time of each chiller should be balanced and the start-stop sequence of each chiller should be reasonably controlled according to their load rate to prolong their service life. On this basis, the energy saving optimization control strategy combines a variable water temperature control strategy with a variable water volume control scheme to ultimately optimize the total energy saving of the refrigeration station system. The two strategies employed effectively cooperate to continuously optimize the energy consumption of the integrated operation of chilled water pumps and chillers, so that the whole system is in the state of energy saving operation. For the variable water temperature control scheme, the optimal supply temperature of the chillers is derived from working parameters of both the chillers and the chilled water pumps. For the variable water volume control, the frequency of the chilled water pump is calculated according to the chilled water supply/return temperature and the valve opening at important terminal air conditioning units based on the constant temperature difference control method. It should be noted that the suggested optimization control strategy can be easily embedded into the refrigerating station's original control system by adding only the necessary data collectors. The proposed control strategy was implemented in a building in Beijing, China. Experimental results after an entire season demonstrate that the control strategy affords a remarkable 63% and 6% energy saving for the chilled water pumps and chillers, respectively, while the air conditioning system operated safely, and meeting the temperature and humidity requirements at the laboratories and offices. 2 System configuration The research objective considers optimizing the air conditioning system of a laboratory building in Beijing, with the related system structure and composition presented in Fig. 1 , and the internal spatial distribution of the building presented in Fig. 2 . The building covers an area of 4100 m 2 , that is split in three floors, one of which is underground. The basement first floor mainly contains power conversion and distribution zones, the air conditioning zone, and the refrigerating station, while the first floor mainly contains laboratory zones (including five laboratory A zones and nine laboratory B zones), and several auxiliary zones for cleaning and epidemic prevention. The laboratory A and laboratory B have different requirements for room temperature and humidity. The second floor mainly comprises of nine laboratories having various functions covering an area of about 600 m 2 , and is also equipped with a small number of offices and conference rooms. The building's air conditioning system is equipped with three chillers of the same model, two for use and one for standby, and 19 terminal air conditioning units operating on a 24-h basis. The employee working hours are from 8:00 to 16:30, and generally, only the air conditioning units in the laboratory area operate after working hours. Hence, the cooling load is high for 8.5 h per day, while during the remaining 15.5 h only a small portion of the cooling load demand is required. The load rate of the chillers varies greatly in the morning and the evening during the transition from the working to the non-working hours and vice versa, with the chiller load rate being adjusted automatically according to the terminal load. However, before running the proposed energy saving optimization control strategy, the chilled water system involves a primary chilled water pump constant-flow system where the chilled water pumps cannot adjust the amount of water flow according to the load change. It should be noted that the original system severely suffered from a \u201clarge flow and small temperature difference\u201d case. Therefore, in this paper, the chilled water system is transformed into a variable-flow system based on the proposed energy saving optimization control strategy. All laboratories comply with the international environmental standards, imposing high standards on the constant zone temperature and humidity. The laboratories have the ambient temperature and humidity requirements presented in Table 1 . Given that the laboratories require fresh air, a full fresh air system is designed. 3 Methodology 3.1 Chiller energy efficiency diagnosis 3.1.1 Chiller load rate analysis In this subsection, the chiller load rate from June to October is analyzed. The cooling capacity of the chiller can be calculated according to temperature difference between supply and return chilled water by Eq. (1): (1) Q e v a p = Q f c p , w ( t r − t s ) where, Q e v a p is the cooling capacity, kW; Q f is the chilled water flow rate, m 3 / h ; c p , w is the specific heat capacity of water; t r is the chilled water return temperature, °C, and t s is the chilled water supply temperature, °C; The refrigerating station's load rate is shown in Eq (2): (2) R = Q e v a p Q n where, R is the chiller's load rate and Q n is the rated cooling capacity of the chiller. For analysis, the load rate is divided into {< 50%, 50\u201360%, 60\u201370%, 70\u201380%, >80%}, and the corresponding operating time distribution is calculated. The analysis results show that the chillers operate under partial load conditions during most of the time. The load rate for 1# chiller illustrated in Fig. 3 . The figure highlights that the 1# chiller has a load rate of <50% for more than 68% of the time examined. This indicates that in a constant flow system, the chilled water pumps run at full power wasting energy and highlighting that energy saving can be achieved by improving the efficiency of the system under partial load. 3.1.2 Analysis of chilled water supply and return temperature difference The temperature difference, between the supply/return chilled or cooling water from June to October, is analyzed. The temperature difference data is divided into {<3 °C, 3\u20134 °C, 4\u20135 °C,>5 °C,}. The statistical results of the 1# chiller are presented in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 , respectively. Both figures highlight that the chilled and the cooling water temperature difference of less than 3 °C accounts for more than 68% and 87%, respectively. The comprehensive data are presented in Table 2 . It can be seen that the original air conditioning system suffers from low efficiency due to presenting a large flow and a small temperature difference. 3.2 Optimal control strategy 3.2.1 Parameter safety ranges The manual of the chiller used in this system stated that the minimum flow rate of chilled water can reach 37.5% of the rated flow rate, and the minimum value of chilled water pump frequency is 26Hz. However, low speed of the chilled water pump can also lead to a decreased efficiency of the frequency converter and the pump. Therefore, considering the system efficiency, hydraulic balance, heat dissipation requirements and safe operation, the strategy sets the lower frequency limit of the chilled water pump to 30Hz. When the chilled water supply temperature exceeds its upper/lower threshold, the chiller will be shut down for safe operation. Since frequent starting and stopping of the chiller will lead to a reduction in chiller service life and an increase in its energy consumption, the threshold for chilled water supply temperature also needs to be carefully designed. The chiller used in this study has a design value of 7 °C for the chilled water supply temperature. Therefore, the strategy sets the lower limit of chilled water supply temperature at 7 °C. From Fig. 6 , it can be observed that the chilled water supply temperature was maintained between 5.5 °C and 10.9 °C before the operation of the optimal control strategy. In this building, air conditioning units in most of the zones only operate from 8:00 to 16:30, except the laboratory zones, which run 24 h a day. Therefore, the upper limit of the chilled water supply temperature is set to 10 °C during night time due to the lower load, and the upper limit of the chilled water supply temperature is set to 8 °C during day time. 3.2.2 Group control strategy The optimal controller and the three chillers are linked through real-time communication to obtain operation data of chillers, along with the load rate and other system parameters. Then the obtained load rate of each chiller or the average load rate of multiple chillers is exploited to adjust the number of chillers in operation. According to the historical chiller operation data, when the chiller load rate reaches 90%\u201395%, high energy efficiency can be guaranteed. Therefore, the number of operating chillers can be reduced to a minimum ensuring their efficient operation and still meet the terminal load, based on the total operating time per chiller that decides the operating priority of each chiller to prolong their service life. When a single chiller is in operation, the controller temporarily saves the instantaneous load rate with a 5-min interval to calculate the chiller's average load rate during a certain time. Accordingly, the recorded instantaneous load rate of the chiller is approximately the average value of the chiller load rate during the last 5 min, and the corresponding average load rate value is calculated in a 15-min interval. If the calculated average load rate is greater than 95%, it means that the terminal load is large and an additional chiller needs to be activated. When multiple chillers are in operation, the controller approximately considers the instantaneous load rate of each chiller as the average load rate of each chiller during the last 5 min, and then calculates the average load rate per chiller every 15 min using the 5-min average load-rates. To determine whether the current total load matches the number of chillers in operation, it is necessary to calculate the load of each of the remaining two chillers when one chiller is closed. If the average load rate per chiller is less than 90% after one chiller is closed, it means that the current load is low and one chiller can be shut down. Eq. (3) and (4) determine the number of operating chillers, i.e., start and stop conditions, where M is the average load rate per chiller after shutting down one chiller, η i is the average load rate of the i t h chiller within 15 min, and N is the number of chillers in operation. (3) M = ∑ i = 1 3 η i N − 1 (4) { M ≥ 90 % Maintain M < 90 % Shut - down 1 chiller According to the balancing principle, the total operating time of each chiller is stored in the controller and the control system prompts the units with a short operating time to start first, and the units with a long operating time to close first. The flow chart of the chiller group-control strategy is presented in Fig. 7 . 3.2.3 Variable water volume control strategy According to the diagnostic results of the system, it can be seen that the chillers operate under low load conditions during most of the time, and there is a serious \u201clarge flow rate and small temperature difference\u201d phenomenon, which is caused by a mismatch between the pump frequency and load variation. With the variable water volume control strategy, the flow rate of chilled water adjusted by the pumps is continuously regulated to match the building load generated by the environment, personnel, and equipment. Terminal pressure difference control and chilled water supply/return temperature difference control are two of the more discussed variable water volume control methods. Compared with the terminal pressure difference control, the temperature difference control is theoretically more energy-efficient, but has higher requirements for the form of pipe network [11]. Temperature difference control requires the installation of temperature difference sensors on the chilled water supply and return mains. When the temperature difference changes according to the terminal load, the controller regulates the chilled water flow rate by adjusting the pump speed so as to keep the temperature difference stable. The variable water volume control system based on the temperature difference is shown in Fig. 8 . The characteristic curve of the pipe network of the variable water volume system applying the temperature difference control method is shown in Eq. (5). (5) H = S Q f 2 where H is the total resistance of the pipe network, m H 2 O ; S is the pipe impedance and Q f is the chilled water flow rate, m 3 / h . The characteristic curve of the system is shown in Fig. 9 , where curve S is the characteristic curve of the pipe network. L 1 is the characteristic curve of the chilled water pump under the design condition, and L 2 is the pump characteristic curve when the impedance S remains unchanged and the terminal load decreases. A 1 is the design condition point of the chilled water pump, and A 2 is the condition point after applying pump speed control. Since the pump speed drops when the terminal load decreases, energy savings can be achieved. Temperature difference control requires simultaneous changes in load across terminal zones, otherwise there will be a hydraulic imbalance in the pipe network, affecting the quality of air conditioning. Hence the temperature difference control is mainly used in the retrofitting of existing building systems, especially in the retrofitting of whole air systems. In this study, most of the air-conditioned zones in the system are laboratories with essentially uniform load variations, and the terminal air conditioning units are full air systems, which meets the above requirements. On the other hand, variable water volume systems based on terminal pressure difference need to consider the pressure difference at the most unfavorable terminal branches. In such a situation, it is necessary to perform a pressure difference test on all the most theoretically-estimated unfavorable terminal positions, and ultimately place the pressure difference sensors at multiple positions for comparison, which is difficult to implement. Therefore, the proposed strategy in this study employs the temperature difference control method. However, utilizing only the constant temperature difference to control the operational chilled water pumps may lead to a hydraulic imbalance in the corresponding branches, imposing the zone temperature and humidity to fluctuate, and ultimately forcing a frequent pump speed correction. To solve this problem, the water valve openings of the important terminal air conditioning units are considered in the temperature difference control. The proposed method is able to achieve variable water volume control with easy engineering implementation. The operating stages of the proposed variable water volume control strategy are presented in Fig. 10 and are the following: 1. The rated temperature difference between the supply and return chilled water of the chillers used in this study is 5 °C. Hence, if the temperature difference ΔT >5 °C, it indicates that the terminal load is relatively high, and the chilled water flow rate needs to be increased via increasing accordingly the chilled water pump frequency by one step to meet the operation requirements of the system under high partial load. Thus, F = F 1 + F S E T where F is the modified chilled water pump frequency, F 1 is the chilled water pump frequency, and F S E T is the step-wise chilled water pump frequency. To reduce fluctuations in pump speed while ensuring that the optimal pump frequency is found quickly, the chilled water pump frequency should be adjusted in smaller steps each time. Therefore, F S E T is set to 2Hz in this study. 2. If ΔT ≤ 5 °C, the controller determines the actual zone temperature. Considering comprehensively to avoid frequent speed regulation of chilled water pumps and ensure control accuracy, the zone temperature difference T d _ r o o m between the detected value and the set point, used for regulating the pump frequency, was set to 0.2 °C for this study. If T d _ r o o m > 0.2 °C and the number of valves with an opening of 100% at important terminal air conditioning units is more than one, the terminal load of the branch is regarded as high and the terminal branch may have an underflow, thus it is necessary to increase the chilled water flow to F = F 1 + 2 , otherwise, F = F 1 − 2 to ensure that there is sufficient supply of chilled water flow. 3. The modified frequency of the chilled water pump T is compared against the upper and lower limits of the set chilled water pump frequency F s e t , and the following if-then rule is established: (6) i f F < F 1 min t h e n F c h = F 1 min (7) i f F 1 min < F < F 1 max t h e n F c h = F (8) i f F > F 1 max t h e n F c h = F 1 max where, F 1 min and F 1 max is the lower and the upper limit of the chilled water pump frequency, respectively, and F c h is the final selected value of the chilled water pump frequency, Hz. 4. A PI controller is used to control the chilled water pump motor so that the pump frequency reaches the modified value F c h . 3.2.4 Variable water temperature control strategy 3.2.4.1 Relationship between chilled water supply temperature and COP of chillers Fig. 11 demonstrates the effect of varying the supply water temperature at partial load rates for the chillers on COP. The figure shows that increasing the chiller water supply temperature can increase the value of the chiller's COP, and the relationship is approximately linear, with each 1 °C increase in water supply temperature increasing the chiller's COP by 2%\u20134%. Therefore, while satisfying the terminal load, the COP of the chiller can be increased by regulating the water supply temperature appropriately to achieve the purpose of energy saving. 3.2.4.2 Energy consumption relationship between chillers and chilled water pumps In the variable water volume system, as the temperature of chilled water changes, the energy consumption of the chillers and the chilled water pumps have a mutual influence. Fig. 12 reflects their changing relationship under different chilled water temperature setting values [12]. From the latter figure, it can be observed that as the chilled water supply temperature increases, the corresponding chiller energy consumption decreases linearly. The air conditioning system needs a large flow to meet the terminal load, and the energy consumption of the chilled water pumps will increase non-linearly. Therefore, the total energy consumption of the chillers and the chilled water pumps will initially decrease and then increase. In this paper, the typical chilled water supply temperature of the chillers is analyzed and then its range is determined while simultaneously a variable water volume control strategy is applied on the chilled water pump. The latter control strategy is continuously revised based on the supply temperature of the chilled water to achieve a real-time optimum energy consumption for both the chillers and the chilled water pumps, entitled dynamic optimal point. An example of managing an energy saving operation is presented in Fig. 12 [13]. 3.2.4.3 Control strategy of variable water temperature of chillers The variable water temperature control strategy proposed in this paper refers to changing the chilled water supply temperature, which needs to be adjusted in coordination with the variable water volume control strategy. In other words, the air conditioning system continuously modifies the chilled water pump frequency through the variable water volume control. From Fig. 12, it can be observed that when the chilled water pump frequency is constantly changing, there is an optimal chilled water supply temperature that minimizes the sum of the energy consumption of the chilled water pumps and the chillers. Therefore, based on the proposed variable water volume control strategy, the optimal chilled water supply temperature is calculated by exploiting the variable water temperature control strategy to continuously revise the current chilled water supply temperature to the optimal value, to ultimately minimize the total energy consumption. The variable water temperature control steps are as follows: 1. When the chillers are turned on, the initial chilled water supply temperature is set to 7 °C. 2. The controller evaluates the valve opening at important terminal air conditioning units. If the number of valves with an opening of 100% is more than one, it indicates that the terminal load of the branch is relatively high. It is necessary to reduce the chilled water supply temperature according to Eq. (9): (9) t s e t , d = t s e t , d − t s e t where, t s e t , d and t s e t are the chilled water supply temperature and the corresponding step size. To reduce fluctuations in chilled water supply temperature while ensuring that the optimal supply temperature value is found quickly, supply temperature should be adjusted in smaller steps each time. In this study, t s e t = 0.2 °C. And then if the terminal load demand of the branch has been satisfied, skip to step. However, if the number of valves with an opening of 100% at important terminal air conditioning units is less than one, then it is necessary to determine which chillers are in operation to respond to the calculation of the current optimal chilled water supply temperature. 3. The controller calculates the partial chiller load rate according to the load of the operating chillers: (10) P L R = Q e v a p C where PLR and Q e v a p are the partial and the actual load rate of the chiller, and C is the actual capacity of the equipment. For a given variable water volume system, the optimal water supply temperature under a certain working condition is mainly related to partial load rate and the wet-bulb temperature of the terminal air inlet. And the optimal water supply temperature will increase as the wet-bulb temperature increases, and decrease as the partial load rate increases. The optimal supply water temperature can be calculated as Eq. (11) deriving from the ASHRAE handbook [14]: (11) T s e t = T w b − ( t w b , d − t s e t , d ) + β ( P L R c h − P L R ) ⋅ ( t w b , d − t s e t , d ) where, T s e t and t s e t , d are the optimal and the set chilled water supply temperature; PLR is the partial load rate, t w b and t w b , d are the wet-bulb air temperature of the terminal inlet, and the corresponding design value, respectively, β and P L R c h are parameters related to the system performance. The iterative method of the ASHRAE handbook [15] is adopted to calculate the current wet bulb temperature, with the calculation process presented in Fig. 13 . β and P L R c h are defined after extensive testing under various working conditions or alternatively they can be approximately estimated according to the system designed parameters utilizing the following equations [14]: (12) P L R c h = 1 ⋅ P c h , d ⋅ S d ⋅ ( t w b , d − t s e t , d ) 3 ⋅ P c h w p , d (13) β = 1 2 ⋅ P L R c h where P c h , d is the rated power of the chiller; P c h w p , d is the rated power of the chilled water pump., and S d is the sensitivity coefficient of the chiller. The calculated optimal chilled water supply temperature is compared with the current supply water temperature value. If the optimal temperature is greater than the current one, then the current chilled water supply temperature is increased to. t s e t , d = t s e t , d + t s e t If it is less than the current value, then the current chilled water supply temperature is reduced to t s e t , d = t s e t , d − t s e t . 4. The modified supply water temperature of the chilled water t s e t , d is compared with the set upper and lower limits and the following if-then rule is established: (14) i f t s e t , d < t min t h e n t c h = t min (15) i f t min < t set,d < t max t h e n t c h = t s e t , d (16) i f t s e t , d > t max t h e n t c h = t max where, t min and t max are the lower and upper limit of the chilled water supply temperature respectively, and t ch is the final selected value of the chilled water supply temperature. To reduce fluctuations in chilled water supply temperature, the calculated optimal water supply temperature is compared with the current supply water temperature, and if t c h − t s e t , d ( k ) < t s e t , then the supply temperature is preserved, i.e., t c h = t s e t , d ( k − 1 ) , where t s e t , d ( k ) is the chilled water supply temperature of the current chiller. Given that the chiller is equipped with a precise electric temperature controller, the optimal supply temperature is input to the chiller's controller through communication equipment. The flow chart of the variable water temperature control strategy is illustrated in Fig. 14 . 4 Results and discussion 4.1 Control effect analysis Given that the air conditioning system of the building runs safely and meets the temperature and humidity requirements of each zone, the proposed controller is evaluated for 168 h considering the chilled water supply temperature, the frequency of the chilled water pumps, the average temperature and humidity of the laboratory A, and the average temperature and humidity of the laboratory B zone, with the experimental results presented in Fig. 15 . From Fig. 15 (a), it can be observed that the laboratory B and laboratory A temperatures are relatively stable between 20 °C and 24 °C. Since laboratories are cleaned by staff every morning and evening, the humidity in these two zones fluctuates considerably as seen in Fig. 15 (b), but it was still controlled within the prescribed range. As seen in Fig. 15 (c) and Fig. 15 (d), the developed controller can adjust the frequency of the chilled water pump and the chilled water supply temperature effectively and continuously. In addition, the chilled water supply temperature changes continuously following the load demand, and the chilled water supply temperature fluctuates within the range of 7°C\u201310 °C. The above results show that the optimal control strategy can satisfy the temperature and humidity requirements of the laboratories. 4.2 Energy saving calculation 4.2.1 Calculation of energy saving of chillers Energy saving of the chillers in terms of electricity saving is calculated before and after implementing the optimal control strategy. The electricity used before implementing the proposed strategy is analyzed through the original operation data of the system, while a mathematical model is developed to exploit the calibration parameters such as load and meteorological parameters, and create an electricity usage model. Then the electricity usage is calculated by exploiting the data acquired from the relevant module and the simulation program. The chiller energy saving calculation steps are [16\u201319]: 1. From the data acquisition module, the variables can be obtained, including the chilled water flow rate, the chilled water supply and return temperature, the cooling water supply temperature, and the real-time power of the chillers. 2. The chiller cooling capacity and the performance index (COP) are calculated before and after implementing the proposed optimal control strategy. Regarding the following equations, Eq. (17) is used to calculate the chiller refrigerating capacity; Eq. (18) and Eq. (19) are used to calculate the chiller COP before and after utilizing the optimal control strategy, respectively, and Eq. (20) calculates the absolute cooling water temperature. (17) Q e v a p = Q f ⋅ ρ w ⋅ C ρ w ⋅ ( t s − t r ) / 3600 (18) C O P b e f o r e = A + B ⋅ Q e v a p + C ⋅ Q e v a p 2 + D ⋅ T c w r t 2 − E ⋅ T c w r t ⋅ T c h w s t (19) C O P a f t e r = Q e v a p P c h i l l e r (20) T c w r t = t c w r t + 273.1 where, Q e v a p is the actual chiller cooling capacity in kW; ρ w is the water density in kg/ m 3 ; C ρ w is the specific heat of water, 4.19 kJ/(kg·°C); T c w r t is the chilled water supply temperature °C; t c w r t is the chilled water supply temperature K; P c h i l l e r is the power of the chiller in kW; t s and t r are chilled water supply and return water temperature in °C, respectively, C O P b e f o r e is the COP of the chiller before applying the optimal energy saving strategy and C O P a f t e r is the COP of the chiller after running the strategy. 3. The improvement of the instantaneous performance of the chillers and the instantaneous energy consumption are calculated as: (21) Δ C O P = C O P a f t e r − C O P b e f o r e (22) E = ( 1 C O P a f t e r − 1 C O P b e f o r e ) ⋅ Q e v a p 4. According to the sampling theorem, a sampling period of 2 min is selected, and the calculation formula of the cumulative saving energy can be expressed as: E s = ∫ 0 t ( 1 C O P b e f o r e − 1 C O P a f t e r ) ⋅ Q e v a p ) d t = ∑ [ ( 1 C O P b e f o r e − 1 C O P a f t e r ) ⋅ Q e v a p ⋅ t ] (23) = ∑ [ ( 1 C O P b e f o r e − 1 C O P a f t e r ) ⋅ Q e v a p ⋅ 30 ] that is, (24) E s = E s + E 30 where Δ C O P is the amount of change in chiller COP; E is the instantaneous energy saving of the chiller; E s is the cumulative energy savings of the chiller. 4.2.2 Calculation of chilled water pumps energy saving Energy saving of the chilled water pumps is calculated similarly to the chiller energy saving calculation process. The calculation process is [19]: 1. The operating frequency and the real-time power of chilled water pumps are obtained. 2. The chilled water pumps that are not controlled by the proposed technique operate at a constant frequency and their operating power is 18.23 kW. Eq. (25) is used to calculate the instantaneous energy consumed by the chilled water pump after implementing the energy saving optimal control strategy: (25) E = 18.23 − P a f t e r 3. According to the sampling theorem, the sampling period is set to 2 min, and energy saving of the chilled water pumps are calculated as, (26) E s = ∫ 0 t ( 18.23 − P a f t e r ) d t = ∑ ( 18.23 − P a f t e r 30 ) that is, (27) E s = E s + E 30 4.3 Analysis of energy saving effect of chillers 4.3.1 Analysis of energy saving effect under variable water temperature control strategy implementating independently For observing the energy saving data in real-time, the data form the developed online energy saving calculation system is presented in Table 3 . As described in Table 3, Point_1 - Point_16 record the chiller energy saving data, which are presented in Fig. 16 . It should be noted that there are a few zero values because one of the chillers operates independently during some time, and thus data sampled based on a combination of these two chillers provided zero values. The chilled supply water temperature of the 2# chiller, the COP before and after applying the energy saving control, and the instantaneous energy consumption of the 2# chiller are statistically analyzed. The corresponding results are presented in Fig. 16. Fig. 16 (a) and Fig. 16 (b) show that the instantaneous energy saving changes with the chilled water supply temperature. As can be seen in Fig. 16 (c), there were significant fluctuations in the COP of the 2# chiller before the variable water temperature control strategy was applied to the refrigeration station system, and the COP of the 2# chiller increased when the variable water temperature control strategy was applied. The above results show that significant energy savings are achieved with the variable water temperature control strategy implementating independently. 4.3.2 Analysis of energy saving effect under variable water volume control strategy implementating independently The energy saving data for the chilled water pumps are calculated from the online energy saving calculation system with the results presented in Fig. 17 , with the meaning of each point described in Table 3. The data of Point_18, Point_19, and Point_20 remain unchanged because when the data were calculated, the system only had the operation condition of the 2# chilled water pump, so the data of Point_18 and Point_19 remain unchanged. When the 2# and 3# chilled water pumps operate at the same time, the accumulative energy saving rate of the 2# chilled water pump is 5673.081 kWh, and the energy saving rate is 40.55%. Accordingly, the accumulative energy saving rate of the 3# chilled water pump is 5903.125 kWh, and the energy saving rate is 48.42%. Fig. 17 highlights that when the 2# chilled water pump operates independently, the energy saving reaches 1714.071 kWh, and the energy saving rate can reach 17.395%. The analysis results show that the proposed variable water volume control strategy has an remarkable energy saving effect. The optimal control strategy was applied to the chilled water pumps after 10:30 on 24th May, prior to which the chilled water pumps had been operating at fixed frequency. The total power of the refrigeration station system from 21st May to 24th May and the dry bulb temperature on each day are shown in Fig. 18 . From Fig. 18(a) and (b), it can be seen that the outdoor temperature was the highest on 24th May compared to the other three days. The power profile of the chiller and chilled water pump operation after application of the optimal control strategy is shown in Fig. 19 . Fig. 19(a) shows the power consumption of the chiller and the chilled water pump on May 23rd. It can be observed that the chilled water pump operated at a fixed frequency and maintained a constant power consumption throughout the day. For comparison, the power profile of the two devices on May 24th are shown in Fig. 19(b). The developed control strategy was implemented from 10:30 to 24:00, and it can be observed that the chilled water pump power consumption decreased significantly after the optimal control strategy intervened. Fig. 19(c) further plots the total power consumption of the refrigeration station system from May 21st to 24th, which decreased significantly after the optimal control strategy was applied from 10:30 to 24:00 on 24th. And despite the highest outdoor temperature, the total power consumption was the lowest during the operation of the developed control strategy compared to the other three days. 4.3.3 Total energy saving calculation The operating parameters of the 2# chiller during the two periods of June 1st to June 7th, and September 5th to September 8th, and that of the 3# chiller during July 7th to July 13th are selected to analyze total energy saving. These periods above include the beginning and end of the refrigeration season, as well as the period of high load operation. The corresponding calculation results are presented in Table 4 . From Table 4, it can be observed that the proposed variable water temperature control strategy affords an energy saving rate for the 2# and 3# chillers of 10.84% and 4.76%, respectively. The 2# chiller operates at the beginning and the end of the refrigeration season, and has a lower load compared to the 3# chiller, which operates in the middle of the refrigeration season. In addition, the chilled water supply temperature has an important influence on the COP, and under the condition of meeting the safe operation requirements, the chiller COP increases by 2%\u20134% for every 1 °C increase of supply temperature. Therefore, raising the chilled water supply temperature can improve chiller efficiency and enhance energy saving effect. In this study, the chilled water pumps and the chillers operate on a one-to-one basis. Pump operation data during the implementation of variable frequency control, from June 1st to September 20th, is statistically analyzed, except for 1# pump, for which variable frequency control was not applied. The corresponding results are presented in Tables 5 and 6 . Tables 5 and 6 demonstrate that the average energy saving rate can exceed 60% after implementating variable pump frequency control. Similarly, to the chillers, the energy saving effect of the 2# chilled water pump is better than that of the 3# chilled water pump, especially in the high load stage of the 3# chilled water pump operating independently. In the latter case, the energy saving rate reaches its lowest value, which indicates that the lower the load rate, the more significant the energy-saving effect can be achieved for a chilled water pump under frequency control. 5 Conclusion This paper proposes a group control scheme and an optimal controller for variable water temperature/volume control for a refrigerating station system in a public building. The group control scheme coordinates each chiller's operating time based on its running time and the chiller load rate. And the operating data of the system before implementing the optimal control is evaluated and it can be found that the system suffered from a \u201clarge flow-rate and a small temperature difference\u201d with low energy efficiency. And it can be also observed that the chillers operated under partial load conditions during most of the time. Hence this study developed an optimal control strategy combining a variable water volume/temperature scheme. For optimizing the total energy consumption, the developed optimal controller regulates the chilled water pump frequency according to the chilled water temperature difference and the valve opening at important terminal air conditioning units, and calculates the chilled water supply temperature under optimal comprehensive energy consumption of chillers and pumps. The control performance is verified under harsh conditions with all outdoor fresh air and strict constant temperature/humidity. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed control strategy operates the air conditioning system effectively with the energy saving rate of the chilled water pumps up to 63% and that of the chillers reaching 6% compared to the original control scheme. And the proposed optimal control strategy can easily be embedded in the existing air conditioning control system. Future research shall further extend the optimal control strategy to air conditioning control systems of other buildings. Additionally, this study will further research the adaptively control, model predictive control, and other types of intelligent control strategies to further improve the energy saving effect of the air conditioning system.

        "dc:description": "In this work, a global energy saving optimal control strategy is proposed to address the high energy consumption of chilled water pumps caused by the small temperature difference between supply and return water, and the low efficiency of the chillers. The developed control strategy consists of two parts: the group control scheme and an optimal controller for variable water temperature/volume control. The group control scheme coordinates each chiller's operating time based on its running time and the chiller load rate. The optimal controller regulates the chilled water pump frequency according to the chilled water temperature difference and the valve opening at important terminal air conditioning units, and calculates the chilled water supply temperature under optimal comprehensive energy consumption of chillers and pumps. The proposed control strategy is easy to be embedded into the existing control systems of refrigerating stations. This scheme is then applied to the air conditioning system of a large public building in Beijing, China. Experimental results show that the proposed strategy can save up to 63% of energy consumption from the chilled water pumps and 6% from the chillers compared to the original control scheme.",
