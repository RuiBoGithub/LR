Handling Editor: X Zhao Demand response (DR) through air conditioning (AC) systems in buildings is a promising way to balance the power grid. However, the majority of existing DR strategies are rule-based. The other ones are model-based but generally have adopted oversimplified AC system models. Consequently, the effect of model-based optimal control cannot be evaluated properly. To address these limitations, a co-simulation framework is developed to minimize power consumption and electricity costs by adopting both pre-cooling and temperature reset strategies. The co-simulation framework combines an EnergyPlus model that is calibrated by measured data and the genetic algorithm through Functional Mock-up Unit socket. Both time-of-use electricity prices and the constraints of thermal comfort are considered in the optimization problem. A real office building with a variable refrigerant flow (VRF) system is used to test the co-simulation framework. Compared with rule-based strategies, the power consumption of the VRF system following the optimal control strategy during the DR period is reduced by 80.12%, 74.70% and 55.60%, and the daily electricity cost is reduced by 14.98%, 12.11% and 8.35%, respectively. The quantitative analysis also reveals that 37.96% of the cold energy stored by the envelope in the pre-cooling period is released into the air during the DR period.

According to \"China's 14th Five-Year Plan\" report [1], the maximum electric power load growth rate is expected to reach 4.8%, which will further increase the peak load of the power grid. In addition, the peak load frequently clusters during the on-peak period, which magnify the imbalance between energy supply and demand, thus leading to the instability of the power grid. Such challenges necessitate effective strategies to mitigate the impact of peak demand and ensure the stability and sustainability of the power grid. To maintain the balance of supply and demand in power grids as well as enhance the reliability of power systems, the concept of demand response (DR) is proposed. According to the definition put forth by Hedegaard and Pedersen [2], DR refers to the capability of end-users to optimize their electricity usage during the on-peak period, resulting in cost reduction and reliability improvement of the power system. Among all the end-users in the power grid, the building sector is the largest contributor to power consumption, representing 30\u201345% of all sectors [3]. Furthermore, in commercial buildings, heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems consume considerable electricity, accounting for 45\u201350% of the building's total power consumption [4]. Due to the thermal inertia of building envelope and the centralized controllability of the HVAC system, it is treated as a high-quality resource for DR implementation. What's more, curtailing and shifting air conditioning (AC) loads can decrease the peak load pressure on the grid with no additional investment. 1.2 Literature review There are two main methods of the operation management in AC systems for DR, namely, the load shifting and load shedding [5]. Load shifting involves moving loads from on-peak periods to off-peak periods by utilizing the heat stored and released from building thermal mass for shifting space cooling/heating loads. One of the primary methods for achieving load shifting is through pre-cooling/pre-heating. As for load shedding, it involves temporarily reducing the power consumption of the AC system during on-peak periods by turning off specific equipment or increasing the temperature setpoint (during summertime). A comprehensive review related to the approaches is carried out as follows. Pre-cooling means charging the building thermal mass before peak demand onset by reducing thermal mass temperature and then discharging the coolness during the peak period. This is typically done by reducing the thermostat setpoint a few hours before the expected peak period to cause the AC system to switch on. When demand and electricity prices increase later, the thermostat setpoint is increased, and the AC system is switched off. The indoor temperature rises slowly, creating an opportunity for AC to delay its operation during on-peak periods and consume less expensive electricity [6]. Numerous studies have been conducted to explore the performance of pre-cooling techniques for curbing the power consumption and cost of commercial buildings. The majority of these pre-cooling approaches can be classified into two categories including rule-based and optimization-based strategies. With regard to rule-based pre-cooling strategies, specifically, Chandan et al. [7] developed a data-driven gray box model that predicted the internal zone temperature to evaluate a variety of different pre-cooling strategies. In the study, two rule-based pre-cooling strategies were carried out with different temperature setpoint of 24.5 °C and 26 °C. The first strategy had a negative effect, resulting in an increase of 17% in peak demand and 6% in power consumption. In contrast, the other strategy which involved pre-cooling by 30 min and selecting a higher setpoint temperature of 26 °C reduced peak demand by 9.5%. Lu et al. [8] built a detailed building and system physics model in TRNSYS. The research concluded that both pre-cooling duration time and pre-cooling temperature had a significant influence on energy flexibility. Shan et al. [9] proposed a model-based control strategy to recover the stored cooling energy from building thermal mass in commercial buildings. In this study, they used the AHU model developed by Lebrun et al. [10]. A simplified building RC model and a black-box model were combined by a simple data fusion algorithm for easier implementation and more accurate prediction. The amount of saving energy accounts for about 7% of the total cooling power consumption in the entire test day. Chen et al. [11] developed an experimental facility; two DR control strategies including pre-cooling and temperature resetting were analyzed in this study. The experimental results showed that the strategies were effective for short-term (0.5 h) and intermediate-term (2 h) DR programs. Those rule-based pre-cooling strategies were mostly implemented based on two conditions. One is based on the change in weather conditions, the other is based on the time-of-use electricity price in different regions. In practice, the latter is more widely used. It achieves load shifting by capturing cold energy at lower electricity price during off-peak hours and releasing it during on-peak hours. However, although this approach is relatively easy to implement, it may not always result in the most efficient or cost-effective pre-cooling. Therefore, the studies focusing on setting pre-cooling strategies through optimization methods have attracted a lot of attention. The process of finding the best pre-cooling strategy can be expressed as an optimization problem to find the optimal solution that minimizes or maximizes the pre-cooling objective [12]. The relevant studies which determined pre-cooling strategies through optimization approaches for commercial buildings were conducted in Refs. [13\u201315]. Specifically, Wang et al. [13] proposed an optimal pre-cooling strategy based on the integer linear programming (ILP) problem, which utilized a first-order thermal model that described only indoor aerodynamics. This strategy minimized energy costs while keeping indoor air temperatures within the comfort range, compared to the three rule-based strategies. Chan et al. [14] developed second order differential equations to capture the temperature dynamics of indoor air and envelope. The results showed that energy cost savings of 35% could be achieved compared to typical rule-based controls. Arun et al. [15] used an optimization algorithm in the gray box building model to minimize the alternating current cost of a commercial building. In general, most of those studies use simplified AC simulation models, which may not fully facilitate the exploration of power consumption characteristics during DR process. As for load shedding, it is the other widely used demand response strategy for AC systems, offering a convenient and fast approach to reducing power consumption. The direct load control method involves shutting down specific equipment during DR events, leading to a rapid reduction in cooling load and electricity consumption [16,17]. Despite its high effectiveness, accurately measuring and regulating the consequent indoor thermal conditions continues to pose a challenge [18]. Alternative approaches, such as adjusting the indoor temperature setpoint, can offer a gentler form of load shedding [19]. Ref. [20] concluded that occupants with lower comfort preferences, who represent approximately 4.76%\u20139.50% of total occupancy hours, might experience a temperature deviation from the reference temperature of +3 to −4 °C due to the proposed thermostat adjustment strategy, which aims to satisfy the operation requirements during the DR periods. By temporarily increasing the temperature during peak times, cooling load and electricity consumption can be reduced, yielding energy savings of up to 10% per degree Celsius [21]. Currently, the research on load shedding is relatively mature. However, few studies have combined it with load shifting or other demand response measures to achieve energy conservation in buildings. 1.3 Hypothesis and objectives Based on the above literature review, the research gaps in the field of achieving DR via AC systems are as follows, (1) Most studies have used rule-based DR strategies. The other ones are model-based but generally have adopted simplified AC system models. Thus, it is difficult to accurately describe the power consumption state of the DR process. (2) Limited research has been conducted on quantitatively analyzing the effect of various factors on DR. (3) Few studies have combined load shifting methods with load shedding methods together to implement DR. Aiming at complementing the research gaps mentioned above, this paper puts forward a co-simulation framework for the purpose of finding the optimal AC control strategy. The main contribution of this study is listed as follows, (1) A simulation model of a building together with its detailed VRF model is firstly established and verified by experimental data. The model is wrapped into a Functional Mock-up Unit (FMU) model to implement a python-based optimization method. Hence, a co-simulation framework was developed. (2) Taking into account load shifting as well as load shedding method, the optimal control strategy is found. (3) The contribution of the building envelope in the demand response process is quantitatively analyzed, which is meaningful for the guide to building design as well as the control of temperature setpoint. The rest of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the development of the modeling and optimization process. Section 3 describes the simulation results and discussion. Section 4 discusses the limitations of the research and the future research focus. Conclusions are finally given in Section 5. 2 Development of the optimal control strategy 2.1 Case building and data acquisition system The test room is in a commercial building situated in Foshan City, Guangdong Province, China. The location of the test room is in the southwest corner of the second floor of the building. Fig. 1 depicts its external environment and the internal view of the room (during occupied hours). The interior layout of the test room is shown in Fig. 2 and the ceiling height of the room is 4 m. There are 25 office staffs working in the test room from 8:00 to 18:00. The construction and materials used in the room are shown in Table 1 . The test room is equipped with a variable refrigerant flow (VRF) system with a rated cooling capacity of 56 kW. Besides, a separate ventilator with a rated air exchange rate of 800 m3/h is also installed in the test room. The VRF system is equipped with sensors that can measure and transmit different data. The collection parameters for the outdoor AC unit and indoor AC terminals of VRF system sensors are listed in Table 2 . In addition to the data of the AC system, the parameters of the test room and outdoor environment are also needed. As shown in Fig. 3 , the data acquisition system is implemented in the test room to acquire accurate thermal status. There are 9 sensors implemented on the different pillars of the test room for indoor air temperature monitoring [22]. Besides, the ambient condition is obtained by the outdoor weather station kit. 2.2 Simulation setup and model validation Fig. 4 shows the workflow of the simulation setup. In this study, EnergyPlus is used for modeling and simulation. The development of the simulation model is discussed in Section 2.2.1 to Section 2.2.3. The model verification is discussed in Section 2.2.4. Finally, a co-simulation framework is developed to implement the optimization algorithms for AC system control, which is discussed in Section 2.2.5. 2.2.1 Modeling of case building Fig. 5 shows the building construction with multi-rooms. In addition to the test room, the other zones are equipped with AC systems as well. The temperature setpoints of the other zones are maintained at 26 °C all day. These zones with the same materials as those in the test room exchange heat with the test room and the ambient environment. The geometric modeling is carried out based on the building parameters of the case study, as outlined in Appendix A. The outside boundary condition of the test room is shown in Appendix B. 2.2.2 Modeling of AC system The test room is equipped with a VRF system, which includes a VRF outdoor unit and 9 VRF terminals. The main parameters of the VRF system are listed in Table 3 . To accurately fit the performance curve of the VRF system, the newest VRF model named VRF-FluidTCtrl in EnergyPlus was chosen [23]. The model has been enhanced with novel attributes, which include the following aspects: (1) utilization of component-level performance curves instead of the overall performance curve of the VRF system; (2) variable evaporating and condensing temperatures of both indoor and outdoor units; (3) variable fan speed based on the temperature and zone load in the indoor unit; (4) a physics model to calculate the thermal loss through the refrigerant piping network considering the variations of refrigerant flow rate and operational conditions [24]. The new features enhance the simulation accuracy of the VRF system performance in both heating and cooling modes, especially during low-load operations. Based on the parameters of the VRF system in the test room, a corresponding model was built to simulate the performance of the VRF system with a rated cooling capacity of 60 kW and a gross rated COP of 3.98. 2.2.3 Internal heat gains setup The internal heat source of the room mainly consists of three components including people, electric equipment and lights. For the heat gain from people, EnergyPlus uses a polynomial function to divide the total metabolic heat gain into sensible and latent portions. With a specific number of people, the model can simulate the power of heat dissipated by occupants. With regard to electric equipment, there are some low-power equipment such as computers in the test room. In the process of modeling, the total heating power is set as 1000 W. For the heat gain from lights, the room is equipped with low-power LED lights with a gross power of 100 W. 2.2.4 Model validation procedure The model validation was completed through a comparison of simulation results with the experimental data for the test room. According to ASHRAE Guideline 14\u20132002 [25], the accuracy of energy models can be evaluated based on NMBE (normalized mean bias error) and CV-RMSE (coefficient of variation of root mean square error), which should not exceed 10% and 30% with hourly time scale, respectively. NMBE and CV-RMSE are calculated by Eq. (1) and Eq. (2), respectively, where n represents the number of data used for the calibration. (1) N M B E = ∑ i = 1 n ( y i − y ˆ i ) n × y \u203e × 100 % (2) C V − R M S E = ∑ i = 1 n ( y i − y ˆ i ) 2 n y \u203e × 100 % To validate the developed model, a comparison was made between the simulated 10-min average electric power for cooling and the experimental data based on the identical operating conditions of a typical summer day. Fig. 6 shows that the simulation result is similar to the trends of the field values. For hourly average results, the NMBE and CV-RMSE are 8.57% and 28.53%, respectively, which satisfies the standard identified by ASHRAE Guideline 14\u20132002. In addition, Fig. 7 compares the experimental daily electricity consumption for cooling with that by simulation based on the data of 12 days in July and August. It is observed that the simulation results agree well with the experimental results. Because the solar radiation in simulation is more intense than that of field conditions, the simulation results are slightly larger than the experimental results. Thus, this model is used to carry out the subsequent simulations. 2.2.5 EnergyPlus-python co-simulation framework The building model was linked to an optimization algorithm program through FMU [26,27], which adheres to the standard defined by the FMI (functional mock-up interface). The genetic algorithm [28] was utilized to identify the optimal control strategy (OCS) for adjusting the temperature setpoints, which was implemented through Python platform. The control loop for the process is illustrated in Fig. 8 . 2.3 Optimization problem formulation Fig. 9 depicts the structure of the optimization problem. The optimization problem mainly considers the heat transfer through thermal mass, the dynamic power of the VRF system and variations in weather condition. Besides, the problem utilizes the thermal comfort criteria and time-of-use electricity price which is introduced in Section 2.3.1. The development of the optimization problem is discussed in Section 2.3.2. 2.3.1 Thermal comfort criteria and time-of-use electricity price The relevant studies have shown that the cooling temperature setpoint can be raised by at least 2 °C without significantly affecting occupants\u2019 comfort [29]. It is important to achieve a balance between energy savings and occupant comfort when implementing DR strategies for AC systems [30]. In this paper, the thermal comfort range of indoor air temperature is from 22 °C to 28 °C, following the thermal comfort requirements of ASHRAE [31]. Furthermore, the time-of-use electricity price in Foshan city is shown in Fig. 10 . During working hours, this pricing structure comprises three distinct categories: mid-peak, on-peak and critical-peak. Notably, the critical-peak period is from 15:00 to 17:00. The electricity price is ¥ 1.43/kWh during the critical-peak period, which is substantially higher than that of the other periods. Hence, the critical-peak hours are considered as the DR period. Besides, the electricity prices during mid-peak, on-peak and off-peak hours are ¥ 0.61/kWh, ¥ 1.03/kWh and 0.232/kWh ¥ ¥ ¥ 0.232 / k W h , respectively. 2.3.2 Objective function and constraints Pre-cooling and temperature reset strategy can be implemented to achieve three main objectives [32]: 1) reduction in VRF electricity cost, 2) reduction in VRF peak power consumption, and 3) thermal discomfort reduction. The description of each objective is listed in Table 4 . OCS can be formulated as an optimization problem to find the best solution [12]. The objective function of OCS includes different objectives. In this paper, the reduction in VRF electricity cost and reduction in VRF peak demand are chosen as the objectives. The objective function is defined by Eq. (3); the corresponding constraints are shown in constraints (Eq. (4) ∼ Eq. (6)). Objective function (3) J = min ( ∑ t ∈ N q t ⋅ P t + ∑ t ∈ γ β ⋅ W t ) Subject to the constraints: (4) W t ≥ E t − e t ∀ t ∈ γ (5) T min ≤ T t ≤ T max ∀ t ∈ N (6) P t ≥ 0 ∀ t ∈ N where q t is the electricity price at t − th timestep; P t is the electricity consumption of VRF at t − th timestep; β is the penalty value for the peak power of VRF exceeding that of baseline strategy during the DR period; W t represents the difference in peak power of VRF between OCS and baseline strategy at t − th timestep during the DR period; E t is the electric power of VRF at t − th timestep; e t is the electric power of VRF at t − th timestep under baseline strategy; T t is the temperature setpoint of VRF at t − th timestep. The variables of the optimization problem are temperature setpoints of the VRF system for all timesteps. During the optimization, a horizon of 10 h is simulated with 10-min timesteps. For the constraints, the relation of VRF peak power for OCS and that of baseline strategy should satisfy Eq. (4). During the DR period, a penalty will be imposed if the VRF electric power of OCS exceeds that of the baseline strategy at the same timestep. In contrast, if the VRF electric power of OCS is smaller than that of the baseline during the DR period, W t is a negative value. In this condition, the penalty factor becomes an incentive factor, which makes the value of the objective function become smaller. Besides, Eq. (5) restricts the temperature setpoint of VRF within the thermal comfort range. On this basis, OCS can be obtained through the optimization process. 2.4 Rule-based operation strategies for comparison According to the work schedule, the VRF system in this office building operates from 8:00 to 18:00. The desired indoor air temperature setpoint for a whole day in summer is 26 °C according to the design standard in Guangdong, China [35]. To verify the energy-saving effect of OCS, three rule-based operation strategies are chosen for comparison after referencing the relative reports. As portrayed in Fig. 11 , both operating strategy Ⅰ (OS Ⅰ) and operating strategy Ⅱ (OS Ⅱ) adopt pre-cooling with different profiles. Specifically, the pre-cooling of OS Ⅰ starts from 13:00 to 15:00, meanwhile, the temperature setpoint is decreased to 24 °C. However, the pre-cooling period of OS Ⅱ starts at 14:00 and lasts for 1 h; at the same time, the temperature setpoint declined to a lower temperature of 22 °C. With regard to OS Ⅲ, the temperature setpoint is raised to 28 °C during the DR period without pre-cooling. What's more, the initial room temperature for all the above operating strategies starts at 28 °C by default. 3 Results and discussions This section presents and compares the simulation results for OS I, II, III and OCS. To be specific, Section 3.1 depicts the profile of OCS. Section 3.2 presents and compares the simulation results of OCS with OS I, II and III. Section 3.3 analyzes the cold storage and release status of the envelope. 3.1 Results of the optimal control strategy The optimal temperature setpoint from OCS is shown in Fig. 12 . It is observed that the VRF system operates with a consistent temperature setpoint of 26 °C during the mid-peak hours from 8:00 to 13:40. From then on, the VRF system is switched to the first stage of pre-cooling period and lasts for 20 min until 14:00, resulting in a temperature reduction from 26 °C to 25.3 °C. Subsequently, the temperature setpoint is lowered to 24.6 °C during the second stage of the pre-cooling period, which starts at 14:00 and lasts for 1 h. From 15:00 to 17:00, the VRF responds to the grid by increasing the temperature setpoint to 28 °C, which is the upper limit of the comfort range. After 17:00, the temperature setpoint resets to the original level of 26 °C corresponding to on-peak hours from 17:00 to 18:00. 3.2 Comparison with rule-based strategies 3.2.1 Indoor temperature and electric power The simulation results of the baseline and the rule-based strategies are shown in Fig. 13 . The variations in the electric power of the VRF system and indoor air temperature were simulated from 8:00 to 18:00 with all strategies. The weather parameters of August 4th, 2022, a representative summer day in Foshan, were utilized for all simulations. As for the baseline strategy shown in Fig. 13 (a), the temperature setpoint of the VRF system maintains at 26 °C throughout the day. It is observed that the indoor air temperature of the test room maintains a comfortable value; however, the electric power of the VRF system during the DR period keeps at a high level. Unlike the baseline strategy, pre-cooling is put into effect in OS I. As shown in Fig. 13 (b), the pre-cooling period starts at 13:00 when the temperature setpoint declines from 26 °C to 24 °C. The VRF system operates under a high load condition to make the indoor air temperature approach the temperature setpoint as soon as possible. The VRF system keeps full load operation with the highest power until the indoor air temperature declines to 24 °C. During this period, the thermal mass in the room continually absorbs the cold energy from the indoor air. During the DR period, the temperature setpoint of the VRF system is reset to 26 °C. It is observed that the indoor temperature gradually increases to 26 °C under the condition that the VRF system maintains a shutdown state for 20 min. During this period, the previously stored cold energy gradually releases to delay the increase in indoor temperature. Besides, there is a short peak power that can be seen at around 15:20 on the graph. This is because in the actual load control process, there is a phenomenon of a sudden increase in load beyond the original normal load when the control is ended and the system returns to normal operation [36]. Similar to OS Ⅰ, the pre-cooling is also implemented in OS Ⅱ, as shown in Fig. 13 (c). Compared to OS Ⅰ, the pre-cooling period of OS Ⅱ is shorter and the temperature setpoint is lower. It is deduced that the VRF system can maintain a shutdown state for 27 min in the DR period which is longer than that of OS Ⅰ. As for OS III shown in Fig. 13 (d), it differs from OS I and II. The main strategy for OS III is to reset the temperature setpoint to 28 °C during the DR period. Since this temperature is close to the upper limit of the temperature comfort range, the power consumption of the VRF system significantly decreases during this period. As a result, the reduction in peak power consumption is realized. In the DR period, the VRF system is capable of maintaining a shutdown state for 28 min. Finally, for the OCS, the optimization algorithm is chosen to control the temperature setpoints of the VRF system at different times to minimize the power consumption during DR and electricity cost. The temperature setpoints exhibit a stair-step decrease trend during the pre-cooling period. As shown in Fig. 14 , the pre-cooling period starts at approximately 13:40, by contrast, 13:00 and 14:00 for OS I and II, respectively. Owing to the fact that the electricity price is low between 13:00 and 14:00, the pre-cooling with the temperature setpoint of 25.3 °C is first implemented for 20 min. As a result, the indoor air temperature decreases to 25.3 °C at 13:56. At 14:00, the temperature setpoint decreases from 25.3 °C to 24.6 °C, and the pre-cooling is further executed from 14:00 to 15:00 to store more cold energy. The period from 15:00 to 17:00 is the DR period, corresponding to the highest electricity price. During this period, the VRF system realizes demand response by adjusting the temperature setpoint and releasing the stored cold energy in the building envelope. The temperature setpoint of VRF is set to be 28 °C which approaches the upper limit of the comfort range during this period. Consequently, the VRF system stops for 42 min, leading to an increase in indoor air temperature. When the indoor air temperature reaches 28 °C at 15:42, the VRF starts to operate again. However, the VRF operates under low load condition during this period because the indoor air is simultaneously cooled by the gradual release of the cold energy stored in the envelopes. In this paper, the transfer of cold energy stored in envelopes will be further discussed in Section 3.3. After the DR period, the temperature setpoint of the VRF is reset to 26 °C during the period from 17:00 to 18:00 corresponding to the standard design value. the VRF operates at a higher load to make the indoor air temperature approach the standard design value as soon as possible. 3.2.2 Power consumption and electricity cost The daily power consumption of the VRF system was calculated, as described in Eq. (7). What's more, the power consumption during the DR period and pre-cooling period were also calculated, as described in Eq. (8) and Eq. (9), respectively. Meanwhile, the daily electricity cost of all strategies was also analyzed, as described in Eq. (10). (7) P daily = ∑ t ∈ N E t × 1 / 60 (8) P D R = ∑ t ∈ γ E t × 1 / 60 (9) P p r e − c o o l i n g = ∑ t ∈ κ E t × 1 / 60 (10) M = ∑ t ∈ N P t ⋅ q t Table 5 lists the power consumption for all strategies in pre-cooling and DR periods. Table 6 lists the daily electricity cost for all strategies. It is evident that the daily electricity cost of the VRF system under the strategies of OS Ⅰ, OS Ⅱ, OS Ⅲ and OCS are lower than that of the baseline strategy. Moreover, the daily electricity cost of the OCS is the lowest. With regard to power consumption, the VRF system under OS Ⅰ and OS Ⅱ consume more electricity than the that of baseline. It is noted that although the VRF system with pre-cooling tends to reduce costs, it may consume more electricity. The reason is that surplus cooling needs to be produced in the pre-cooling period and store it in the building envelope. The stored cold energy can then be released in the DR period to reduce peak power consumption of the VRF. It is also observed that the VRF under OS Ⅱ consumes less electricity than that of OS Ⅰ during pre-cooling period. Besides, VRF under OS Ⅱ consumes less electricity than that of OS Ⅰ in the DR period. This indicates that a longer pre-cooling period may result in a waste of cold energy. Meanwhile, a lower temperature setpoint during pre-cooling period can increase the temperature difference between the internal walls and indoor air during the response period. Consequently, a larger temperature difference is more helpful to the release of stored cold energy. As for OS Ⅲ, the increase in the temperature setpoint of the VRF system during critical-peak hours leads to a significant reduction in peak power consumption during the DR period. The reason is that the increase in temperature setpoint allows for a longer off-time of the VRF system; meanwhile, the power consumption required for the VRF system to operate at the higher temperature setpoint is also lower. Additionally, although there is no pre-cooling in OS III, the temperature of the internal walls is still lower than the indoor air temperature after the temperature setpoint is raised, which is further discussed in Section 3.3. As a result, the cold energy stored in the walls releases into the air during the DR period. For OCS, although the daily power consumption of the VRF system is a little higher than that of OS Ⅲ, the power consumption during the DR period is the lowest. Because OCS combines the advantages of pre-cooling and temperature reset strategy, it is capable of fully utilizing the thermal characteristics of the building envelope. It is therefore concluded that the VRF system with OCS achieves the best performance in terms of cost savings and peak power consumption reduction. 3.3 Analysis of cold energy storage and release of envelope under OCS The above analysis shows that OCS exhibits superior performance in reducing both power consumption and electricity cost. This remarkable performance is attributed to the exploitation of the building thermal mass. To quantify the function of different interior envelopes including ceiling, floor and internal walls in DR period, the amount of cold energy stored and released in these surfaces is further analyzed. The simulation results of heat gain rate of each internal surface from indoor air are presented in Fig. 15 . It is observed that the variations in heat gain rate for all of the internal surfaces exhibit similar trends. As a result, the process of cold energy transfer is analyzed in detail using the ceiling as an example. As depicted in Fig. 15 (a), the ceiling absorbs cold energy at a low rate from 8:00 to 13:40, due to the small temperature difference between the ceiling temperature and the indoor air temperature. During the first stage of pre-cooling period from 13:40 to 14:00, the indoor air temperature decreases, which results in an elevation of the temperature difference between ceiling and indoor air. Consequently, the rate of cold storage increases from 260 W to 519 W. During the second stage of pre-cooling period, the temperature setpoint decreases from 25.3 °C to 24.6 °C. Therefore, the temperature difference between ceiling and indoor air is further enlarged. As a result, the rate of cold storage of ceiling increases from 516 W to a peak of 649 W. From 15:00, the DR period commences, which is characterized by an increase in temperature setpoint to 28 °C. During this period, the temperature difference between the ceiling and indoor air decreases since the indoor air temperature keeps rising. Therefore, the rate of ceiling cold storage also decreases continuously. When the indoor air temperature exceeds the ceiling temperature, the ceiling begins to release cold energy into the indoor air. It is observed that the ceiling transitions from cold storage to cold release, which is marked by the red circle in Fig. 15(a). Besides, the rate of cold release increases continuously with the rise of indoor air temperature. The power of the ceiling cold release reaches a peak value of 536 W until the indoor air temperature reaches 28 °C. Because the reduction of the temperature difference hinders heat transfer due to the gradual increase in the temperature of the ceiling, the rate of cold release begins to slowly decrease. After the DR period, the temperature setpoint of VRF is reset to 26 °C from 17:00. It is seen that the decrease in indoor air temperature causes a rapid decrease in cooling rate of ceiling. When the indoor air temperature drops below the ceiling temperature, the ceiling resumes the state of cold storage. The above analysis based upon Fig. 15 also reveals the reason why the temperature setpoint under OCS is further lowered during the second stage of pre-cooling period even when the electricity price rises. Specifically, during the period between 14:00 and 15:00, the temperature setpoint of VRF is lowered in order to increase the temperature difference between the air and inner walls before the DR period. As a result, more cold energy stored in the walls can release into the air. The quantitative analysis was conducted to reveal the amount of cold storage for each internal surface during the pre-cooling period, as described in Eq. (11). Meanwhile, the amount of cold energy for each internal surface released during the DR period was also analyzed, as described in Eq. (12), where I t represents the heat gain rate of each internal surface at t − th timestep. (11) C _ s t o r e d = | ∑ t ∈ κ I t × 1 / 60 | (12) C _ r e l e a s e d = ∑ t ∈ γ I t × 1 / 60 Table 7 shows the amount of cold stored and released by different internal surfaces of the building envelope. It is observed that the performance of cold storage during pre-cooling for both ceiling and floor is better than that of other surfaces because their area is bigger than that of others. Furthermore, the ceiling releases more cold energy during the DR period than that of the floor because warmer air usually drifts to the upper part of the room to increase the temperature difference between the ceiling and indoor air. In addition, the cold energy stored and released by the south and west walls is much smaller than that by the north and east walls. It is because the window-to-wall ratio of the south and west walls is relatively high; besides, the outer sides of these two envelopes are in direct contact with the external environment. Consequently, most of the cold stored by them is transferred to the ambient environment. In summary, the amount of cold energy released during the DR period accounts for approximately 37.96% of the total cold energy stored in the pre-cooling period. 4 Conclusion In this study, an optimal control strategy was proposed to minimize the daily electricity cost and power consumption of the air conditioning system under the background of demand response. A co-simulation framework was developed by integrating EnergyPlus with an optimization algorithm based on Python through FMU socket, which was used to find the optimal control strategy (OCS). The OCS was compared with three rule-based strategies (OS I, OS Ⅱ and OS Ⅲ) to evaluate its performance in reducing power consumption during the demand response period and total energy cost. In addition, the contribution of the building envelope in the demand response process was quantitatively analyzed. The main conclusions are summarized as follows, (1) A co-simulation framework supported by EnergyPlus and the genetic algorithm was put forward to find the optimal control strategy. By use of the physics-based VRF models in EnergyPlus, the power consumption state of the DR process can be accurately described. Furthermore, the framework is capable of quantitatively analyzing the cold stored and released by different internal surfaces of the building envelope. (2) It is demonstrated that the optimal control strategy outperforms other strategies in terms of the reduction in both power consumption during the demand response period and daily electricity cost. Compared to the three rule-based strategies, the peak power consumption with optimal control strategy decreases by 80.12%, 74.70% and 55.60%, respectively. Correspondingly, the electricity cost with optimal control strategy in working hours decreases by 14.98%, 12.11% and 8.35%, respectively. (3) The superior performance of the optimal control strategy is due to the full utilization of the cold energy stored or released by the building envelope. Specifically, the building envelope during the demand response period can release 37.96% of the cold energy that was previously stored during the pre-cooling period.

        "dc:description": "Demand response (DR) through air conditioning (AC) systems in buildings is a promising way to balance the power grid. However, the majority of existing DR strategies are rule-based. The other ones are model-based but generally have adopted oversimplified AC system models. Consequently, the effect of model-based optimal control cannot be evaluated properly. To address these limitations, a co-simulation framework is developed to minimize power consumption and electricity costs by adopting both pre-cooling and temperature reset strategies. The co-simulation framework combines an EnergyPlus model that is calibrated by measured data and the genetic algorithm through Functional Mock-up Unit socket. Both time-of-use electricity prices and the constraints of thermal comfort are considered in the optimization problem. A real office building with a variable refrigerant flow (VRF) system is used to test the co-simulation framework. Compared with rule-based strategies, the power consumption of the VRF system following the optimal control strategy during the DR period is reduced by 80.12%, 74.70% and 55.60%, and the daily electricity cost is reduced by 14.98%, 12.11% and 8.35%, respectively. The quantitative analysis also reveals that 37.96% of the cold energy stored by the envelope in the pre-cooling period is released into the air during the DR period.",
