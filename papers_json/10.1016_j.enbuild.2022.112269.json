Many businesses are looking for ways to improve the energy and carbon usage of their buildings, particularly through enhanced data collection and control schemes. In this context, this paper presents a case study of a food-retail building in the UK, detailing the design, installation and cost of a generalisable model predictive control (MPC) framework for its Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system. The hardware/software solution to collect relevant data, as well as the formulation of the MPC scheme, is presented. By utilising cloud-based microservices, this approach can be applied to all modern building management systems with little upfront capital, and an ongoing monthly cost as low as $6.39/month. The MPC scheme calculates the optimal temperature setpoint required for each Air-Handling Unit (AHU) to minimise its overall cost or carbon usage, while ensuring thermal comfort of occupants. Its performance is then compared to the existing legacy controller using a simulation of the building\u2019s thermal behaviour. When simulated across two months the MPC approach performed better and achieved the same thermal comfort for a lower overall cost. The economic optimisation resulted in an energy saving of 650 kWh, with an associated cost savings of $240 (an improvement of 1.7% compared to the baseline), while the carbon optimisation gave negligible CO2 savings due to the inability of the building to shift heating to low-carbon periods. Findings from this study indicate the potential for improving building performance via MPC strategies, however the level of impact will depend on specific building attributes.

In a 2021 report by the International Energy Agency (IEA), authors note that globally the buildings sector remains off track to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, and that to meet this target, all new buildings and 20% of the existing building stock would need to be carbon neutral by 2030 [1]. The United Kingdom specifically has shown deep commitment with its pledge to reach Net Zero by 2050, resulting in a greater use of renewable energy generation and policies that intend to decarbonise key economic sectors [2]. With buildings representing over 40% of the UK's total carbon footprint, decarbonising the built environment is crucial to living up to this promise. Notably, as 80% of 2050 buildings have already been built [3], retrofitting the current stock is critical to meet the carbon footprint reduction goals. Building retrofits, particularly in the non-domestic sector, need to be done employing a sound approach in which property managers and investors collaborate to ensure buildings are upgraded in terms of technology and controls [4]. Retrofit investments can unlock significant savings given the long lifecycle of these buildings. As suggested by O\u2019Dwyer et al. [5] while energy management systems in buildings control complex heating, cooling and electrical processes these are usually rule-based approaches for managing relevant components that determine operational decisions. The lack of a more comprehensive approach that takes into account further internal and external conditions that influence the optimal use of energy leads to unnecessary inefficiencies in the built environment. Commercial buildings account for 11% of final energy consumption in the UK [6], with a breakdown of different sectors shown in Fig. 1 . These buildings operate several energy services to fulfil end-user requirements, with Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) being the largest, representing approximately 50% of their total energy consumption. The food retail sector in particular remains an important area to decarbonise given its energy-intensive business relying on both heating and refrigeration. Out of the energy services available in a typical UK supermarket shown in Fig. 2 , HVAC services (incl. the boiler heating system) is the major one representing about 40% of thermal and electrical consumption [7]. Currently, in today\u2019s buildings, HVAC management systems lack flexibility and adaptability for multiple reasons. Firstly, their centralised architecture usually operates with non-standardised, proprietary communication protocols managed by manufacturers. Secondly, they are typically controlled using simple Proportional-Integral (PI) schemes. These control strategies use measured indoor air temperature as an input to control local actuators, such as valves and dampers to regulate the mass flow rate in the zone [8]. Although relatively easy to implement, their limits reside in the fact that they cannot account for dynamic processes and anticipate events such as buildings' thermal inertia or changes in local weather conditions [9]. In this context, much effort has been devoted to optimising HVAC operations in commercial buildings by improving their flexibility and efficiency via both control strategy upgrades and hardware architecture retrofits. In recent years, particular interest has been dedicated to Model Predictive Control (MPC), an optimisation-based control framework which uses a dynamic building model combined with disturbance forecasts to determine the optimal control action for a given objective function. For deployment in commercial HVAC systems, real-time data is read from the existing building management system (BMS) and used to determine the immediate control action (e.g., space temperature setpoint, supply fan speed, heating valve position, etc.) which minimises energy usage, carbon intensity or breaches in thermal comfort. This two-way communication is typically achieved by retrofitting the legacy BMS with either an additional on-site server, or a network gateway to allow remote connection to an external server [10]. To give a few relevant examples from the literature, a local approach is used in [11], where an OPC server was installed on the existing BMS, to allow communication with another computer (OPC client) where the control scheme was hosted. The devices communicated on the building\u2019s intranet, using a LonWorks based communication architecture, which requires an additional i.Lon 100 network controller. This approach requires extensive networking knowledge to design and deploy and is highly specific to the chosen building. In addition, access to the sensor/controller data is restricted to devices on the local network, preventing any remote diagnostics or monitoring for the control scheme. Similarly, in [12] a file transfer protocol (FTP) server is setup to integrate the building\u2019s existing BMS, and allow users to set and get any monitoring or control variable in relation to the HVAC system. KairosDB, a cloud based database service is used for data storage, but limited detail is provided on how to implement this bespoke hardware/software solution. In [13] a cloud-based platform is presented, using an IoT gateway to both collect sensor data from the building and communicate with the legacy BMS. This gives the user much greater accessibility to their data and control scheme as it can be easily accessed by any user on the internet. This also presents the opportunity for users to leverage their data for additional benefit, for example, real-time monitoring of key systems and actuators. However, the cloud-platform presented was a bespoke design for the study, again requiring advanced knowledge of networking and software integration to deploy. Alternative control approaches are also present in the literature. In [14] authours compare the performance of 4 reinforcement learning (RL) models, trained to minimise HVAC energy and maintain thermal comfort by manipulating temperature setpoints and air mass flowrates. Compared to a baseline model-based controller simulated in Energy Plus the best RL approach improved savings by 10%, however no details on hardware or software implementation were presented. An adapted MPC approach was used in [15], where a neural network was trained to predict system energy usage based on historical weather conditions, rather than developing a physics-based or grey box system model. This approach was effective, minimising energy usage by 5.7% compared to the baseline relay control. Another data-driven control approach compared comparably to a classical model-based approach in numerical simulations in [16]. The approach was then implemented in a large single zone building, where it resulted in energy savings of 18% compared to the baseline bang-bang control scheme. To summarise, despite the abundance of research in HVAC control, designing, and especially deploying, an advanced control strategy remains a complex task, given the distributed nature of commercial HVAC systems and fundamental components heterogeneity (e.g. Air Handling Units (AHU), Variable Air Volume (VAV) boxes, heat pumps). Most work in this area focuses on the mathematical formulation of the proposed control scheme, but and full-scale, real-world demonstrations of the implementation and costs of deploying such a solution are lacking [17]. Even in cases where real-world testing is undertaken, the details of the specific data collection and control implementation are limited [18] or often building-specific. Additionally, as shown above, the technical knowledge required to deploy such solutions is extensive and therefore limits actual implementations in the commercial sector. With this background and motivation, this paper presents a detailed, real-world case study for the design and installation of a generic data-collection and control framework for HVAC systems in a food-retail building. The proposed MPC scheme provides a supervisory layer of control on top of the existing BMS, sending informed temperature setpoints to the legacy controller. This ensures applicability of the approach to a wide range of existing HVAC systems in commercial buildings. Additionally, the use of Amazon Web Services (AWS) to host the cloud-based infrastructure greatly reduces the technical knowledge typically required to deploy such solutions. We also present key learnings and indicative costs from the installation process, thus reducing uncertainty for prospective project managers and increasing deployment of similar solutions. As a result, the contribution of this paper to the wider literature will help inform academics and building industry specialists of a simple and flexible MPC framework to retrofit legacy HVAC systems; making the most of new technology available to jumpstart the evolution of smarter controls in commercial buildings. In the following sections we first present the proposed hardware/software solution and the formulation of the MPC scheme in Section 2. Next the findings from the case study installation are discussed in Section 3, followed by a presentation of the simulated MPC performance in Section 4. Finally, a wider discussion of the approach and a conclusion of the main findings are covered in Sections 5 and 6 respectively. 2 Methodology This paper presents the design and deployment of a replicable, cloud-based monitoring and control platform to optimise the operation of an existing HVAC system in a commercial building. This section first describes a generic hardware and software solution which can be retrofit with an existing building management system (BMS). This allows both collection of system data for model development, and provides communication with the legacy HVAC controllers to enact optimal control changes. Next the mathematical formulation of the MPC scheme is presented, showing how these optimal control actions are determined. The subsequent section details the case study where this cloud-based solution was deployed in a food retail building. 2.1 Cloud-based solution and hardware MPC schemes require a combination of historical, real-time and forecast data to operate. In Fig. 3 we present the structure of a hardware/software solution able to collect and store this data, as well as hosting the MPC scheme. Amazon Web Services (AWS) [19] was the cloud provider used in this study, but the approach is easily generalised to allow replication using any similar service, e.g., Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud. A description of each component and microservice can be found below: \u2022 Existing BMS: A collection of controllers connected through a local network (intranet) via a communication protocol such as BACnet or Modbus TCP. Each plant item in the building will have a controller which sits on the network. \u2022 Remote Gateway: Provides a bi-directional connection between the existing BMS and the cloud platform over a 4G or existing ethernet connection, using a communication protocol such as HTTPS or MQTT. \u2022 AWS IoT Core: Message broker which ingests incoming messages from all clients (remote gateway and lambda functions), forwarding incoming messages to the rules engine and publishing messages from MPC scheme to the remote gateway. \u2022 Rules Engine: Extracts data from MQTT messages and inserts into DynamoDB database. \u2022 DynamoDB: A database service to store all BMS readings and external API data for use in the MPC scheme, and track historical control actions for retrospective performance assessment. \u2022 Lambda Functions: Serverless compute resources to query required APIs, extract required data, and insert into DynamoDB database. Also hosts MPC control scheme which reads/writes data from DynamoDB, and forwards optimal control actions to AWS IoT Core message broker. \u2022 External APIs: This study used hourly external temperature forecasts from DarkSky [20] and half-hourly grid carbon factor forecasts from the National Grid's Carbon Intensity API [21]. A common alternative to a cloud-based approach presented is to host the entire system locally on-site, installing and configuring a local server or PLC to handle the data ingestion, storage and computation requirements. Compared to this approach, a cloud-based solution has a number of notable benefits. Firstly, many modern BMS systems already include a remote gateway for data collection and monitoring, meaning there is little to no physical intervention required on-site, reducing the disruption to building operations and reducing the cost of installation. Secondly, configuring a local server with the required functionality is a more technically challenging task, requiring extensive networking and software design experience, compared to AWS which handles integration between microservices. This, combined with the ability to easily scale up and redeploy the cloud-based infrastructure, makes the replication and wider rollout of a cloud-based approach across a large building estate faster and with lower upfront cost compared to a localised approach. In the case where the existing BMS does not have a remote gateway, many retrofit solutions exist and one approach is presented later in Section 3. 2.2 Model predictive control The MPC layer proposed here seeks to minimise the energy cost or carbon usage of the HVAC system by computing an optimal control trajectory online in a receding horizon whereby prediction trajectories are updated at each timestep. At the heart of this online optimisation is a dynamic model of the thermal behaviour of the building. A low-order linear model is used here to ensure convexity in the resulting controller\u2019s optimisation formulation. Specifically, an ARX model (autoregressive with exogenous inputs) is used following the approaches often used in building control literature [13]. In this section, the modelling approach and optimisation formulation that form the basis of the MPC algorithm are described. Fig. 4 shows how the proposed supervisory MPC scheme integrates with the existing local control system, passing the calculated optimal temperature setpoint, T sp ∗ , to the legacy HVAC PI controller at each timestep. A clear benefit of this approach is that no knowledge of the inner control loop is required, as we can safely assume the legacy PI controller has already been tuned to maintain a specific space temperature setpoint for the building. 2.2.1 Dynamic building model Various modelling approaches have been proposed in the building energy sector. White-box models based on the physical parameters of the system can be used, however, these are reliant on a detailed knowledge of the building fabric which can be a barrier to scalable deployment [22]. Contrastingly, black-box modelling methods avoid this expertise requirement, but the strong excitation of the data needed for training can be prohibitive [23]. As a compromise, grey-box methods, in which a model structure is pre-defined, but the parameters are identified from data, have been shown to perform well in the field of building energy management [24]. Here, we model the thermal behaviour of each AHU zone using an ARX model (auto-regressive with exogenous inputs). For a system with n air-zones to be controlled and m heat supply sources, at time k , the prediction of the space temperature in the i th zone, y ^ i k is defined in Eq. (1). (1) y ^ i k + 1 = α 1 i y ^ i k + α 2 i T out k + α 3 i Q k + α 4 i T out ( k ) is the external temperature, Q ( k ) ∈ R m is the heating load from the HVAC system and α 1 ∈ R n , α 2 ∈ R n , α 3 ∈ R n × m and α 4 ∈ R n are parameters found by minimising the Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) of the space temperature predictions from those observed for a batch of historical data. 2.2.2 Model predictive control formulation In the proposed strategy, the MPC layer receives updated measurements from the system and determines optimal air temperature and heat supply trajectories at each timestep. The first element of the optimal temperature trajectory is sent as a setpoint to the pre-existing legacy control layer of the system. Typically, the low layer is composed of Proportional-Integral (PI) controllers or on-off actuators and will respond at a far higher frequency than the MPC layer. The integration of MPC with this low-level layer ensures robustness against higher frequency system variation and is generally considered good practice [25]. The control structure is shown in Fig. 5 . The MPC layer calculates optimal setpoints over a prediction horizon N by solving a multi-objective optimisation problem in which a weighted combination of financial cost and carbon emissions are minimised. The objective also includes heavily weighted slack variables, given for zone i as ∊ i ∈ R N , which penalise deviations of the internal air temperature outside pre-defined building comfort bounds. With a sample time of Δ t , the objective can then be formed as in Eq. (2) below, (2) J = min Q , ∊ , y ∑ k = 0 N - 1 ∑ j = 1 m η Q j k Δ t w 1 p k + w 2 G C k + w 3 ∑ i = 0 n ∊ i k , with w 1 , w 2 and w 3 acting as user-defined parameters used to define the balance between cost, CO2 and comfort penalty w 3 ≫ w 1 . In practice, choosing w 3 ≫ w 1 and w 3 ≫ w 2 ensures comfort constraints are only violated when alternative policies are infeasible. As the weights dictate a balance between potentially conflicting terms, i.e., comfort, energy, and carbon, the most suitable choice of weight is subjective. Different users may have different preferences and choosing weights that correspond to an operator's preference is not trivial as the weights themselves don't correspond to physical properties. Here, the availability of a detailed simulation model allows for this tuning to be made through off-line trial-and-error testing. More systematic approaches can be found, for example [26], while prioritised-objective formulations have also been proposed [27] to preclude the need for tuning altogether. Augmenting the scheme proposed these with such methods is seen as a future work. η represents the conversion efficiency of the heat source, while p k and G C k denote the electricity price and CO2 intensity of the grid at time k respectively. The building model from Eq. (1) and the slack variables are included for each zone i by the following constraints, Eqs. (3-6), imposed ∀ k ∈ { 0 , ⋯ , N - 1 } : (3) y ^ i k + 1 = α 1 i y ^ k + α 2 i T out k + α 3 i Q k , (4) y LB k - ∊ i k ≤ y ^ k + 1 ≤ y HB k + ∊ i k , (5) y ^ i 0 = y i 0 , (6) ∊ i k ≥ 0 , where y LB ( k ) and y HB ( k ) respectively denote the user-defined lower and upper comfort bounds for the internal air temperature and y 0 ∈ R n are the most recent internal air temperature measurements. Constraints on the inputs are defined ∀ k ∈ { 0 , ⋯ , N - 1 } , ∀ j ∈ { 1 , ⋯ , m } in Eqs. (7 and 8). (7) Q j k ≤ C p air m ¯ j y ¯ j - y ^ k , (8) Q j ( k ) ≥ 0 , where C p air is the specific heat capacity of air, m ¯ j is the maximum air mass flow rate of the HVAC system and y ¯ j is the maximum air temperature of the j th HVAC supply. The ramp rate of the HVAC system is constrained ∀ k ∈ { 0 , ⋯ , N - 2 } , ∀ j ∈ { 1 , ⋯ , m } by Eqs. (9 and 10). (9) Q j k + 1 - Q j k ≤ Δ Q ¯ j , (10) Q j k - Q j k + 1 ≤ Δ Q ¯ j , where Δ Q max is the maximum ramp rate of the j th HVAC supply. The first element of the optimal zone temperature trajectory y ^ i 1 for each zone is used as a setpoint for the lower PI control layer, y sp ∗ . 3 Case study To test the feasibility and effectiveness of the methodology, a pilot study was conducted in a food-retail building in the UK. First a description of the building is presented along with details of the deployment of the proposed approach. Next a simulation environment was developed to test the MPC approach. Furthermore, the existing PI controller was also modelled to provide a baseline control case. Finally, a number of scenarios were developed to compare and contrast against the simulated baseline. 3.1 Building Description Built in 2012, the building is located 100 miles north of London and has an overall area of 7600 m2. The scope of the study concerns the two AHUs responsible for indoors conditions management within the main sales area, a schematic of which can be seen in Fig. 6 . The building is open from 7 am to 10 pm on weekdays and Saturdays, and from 10 am to 4 pm on Sundays. The legacy HVAC system uses PI controllers for each AHU to maintain the desired space temperature, which changes across the day; 19 °C is the temperature setpoint used when the building is open for customers (occupied) and 17 °C for the rest of the day during restocking and cleaning (non-occupied). There is also a pre-heat module included in the strategy which determines a preheat period for the building dependant on the internal and external temperatures. This ensures the space temperature is at setpoint when the building opens. The building is equipped with a ground-source heat pump (GSHP), which uses electricity from the grid to provide several services to the building, including hot water for the two AHUs via heating coils. AHU1 is responsible for part of the sales area indoors conditions, including the refrigerated aisles. AHU2 is also responsible for maintaining the sales area indoors conditions while also managing the shop front and checkouts. The existing BMS uses Trend IQ4 controllers for each AHU, which communicate on the local area network (LAN) via the BACnet protocol. 3.2 Retrofit implementation The first stage of the retrofit was to conduct a site visit to audit the existing BMS and identify available datapoints which could be collected or written to. Although there was found to be an existing remote gateway with rudimentary data collection as part of the existing BMS, the decision was made to install an additional gateway. This made the collected data, and frequency of data collection completely configurable, and also prevented unnecessary interference with the existing system. A data collection device was also installed which supported drivers to convert from BACnet to MQTT, to allow data extraction from the building\u2019s local intranet. MQTT is a lightweight, open messaging protocol which employs a publish/subscribe communication pattern, initially created as a proprietary protocol to communicate with supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems in the oil and gas industry. Using its Quality of Service (QoS) functionality the delivery of messages between clients is assured even across intermittent or low-bandwidth networks, making it ideal for control applications. For these reasons MQTT was selected for this project, in combination with a wireless 4G connection to connect to the cloud platform. The remote gateway was setup to send sensors/setpoint readings based on a Change of Value (COV) rule, meaning values were only transmitted if they varied from the previous value by a specified amount, summarised in Table 1 . This process minimises the amount of data sent from the building to the cloud platform, while ensuring no loss in relevant behaviour. Furthermore, it reduces the amount cloud storage required, resulting in additional cost savings. As seen in Table 2 , cloud costs are dominated by the compute time required to run the MPC scheme, making up around 91% of the overall cost. As the pricing structure for lambda function is on a linear scaling against compute time, any change in the compute time required per MPC cycle will have a significant effect on the overall monthly cloud costs. It is important to note these costs only consider the requirements for running the MPC control scheme, and not any additional system monitoring or data visualisation services. These costs are also subject to change overtime but are accurate at the time of publication. Note these costs do not include any free tier services offered by AWS. In addition to the initial site visit, three further days were required on-site to install and test the remote gateway for read and write functionality. A breakdown of the capital costs is shown in Table 3 , with an overall spend of $34,420. As many modern and upcoming BMS systems include a fully configurable remote connection, this cost can be reduced significantly, if not entirely. The on-site works were conducted during normal opening hours, with no disruption to the HVAC, BMS or building operation. Despite the preliminary site visit, some issues arose during installation which should be considered for future deployments. Firstly, some remedial works had been conducted on site prior to this project, and the BMS schematics had not been updated to reflect these changes, necessitating some minor modifications to the retrofit approach. Additionally, one site visit had to be aborted due to lack of organisational planning between the building\u2019s staff and the installation team. Effective communication and project management between relevant stakeholders is key when deploying retrofits of this kind to not incur unnecessary costs. 3.3 Simulation environment A simulation environment allows for testing and consistent comparisons of HVAC strategies before real-world testing is conducted. In this study the simulation environment is made up of a building thermal model, which describes the thermal behaviour of the building in response to a specific HVAC heat load and external temperature, and a PI controller to capture the behaviour of the legacy HVAC system. This simulation environment was used to test our MPC formulation and generate all the results in Section 4. Fig. 7 below summarises the boundaries of our simulation environment and how the MPC scheme interacts with it. 3.3.1 Building thermal model A resistance capacitance (RC) network approach was used to create a suitable model for the thermal behaviour of the building used in the case study. The following assumptions are made in choosing a suitable model structure: \u2022 The sales area is modelled as a single zone, meaning the heat transfer from the 2 AHUs will be considered when calculating the resulting temperature. \u2022 The heat flows between the sales area, and the ground are negligible thanks to efficient insulation. \u2022 No convective heat transfer due to entrance lobby and door curtains. \u2022 The walls and ceiling are assumed to be external surfaces without glazing. \u2022 The difference between exterior wall temperature and exterior air temperature is negligible. Hence, the outside wall temperature is assumed to be equal to the external air temperature. Following these assumptions, the RC model structure is shown in Fig. 8 . The network uses 3R2C models for each external wall, as well as the roof, and a further 2R2C model to represent the building\u2019s internal heat capacity (e.g., furniture or fixtures). In the diagram, R and C are resistance and capacitance values respectively, T is the temperature, and subscripts wi, r, m and in represent the ith wall, roof, internal mass and internal air of the building respectively. Model parameters are determined using a genetic algorithm (GA) optimisation approach as shown in [28]. 3.3.2 Simulated PI controller Each AHU in the case study building is currently under PI control whereby the controller seeks to maintain the building\u2019s air temperature at its appropriate setpoint during occupied hours. Due to the slow thermal dynamics of the building, a preheat period is included each day to bring the building temperature towards its setpoint before the occupancy period begins. This PI strategy with pre-heating is modelled as part of the simulation environment and used as the baseline in the analysis of the MPC. Different pre-heating durations were used to illustrate the trade-off between comfort violations and energy consumption. 3.4 Scenario analysis The scenarios analysed in the results section are summarised in Table 4 . The baseline approach is simulated using the modelled PI controller and used to calculate the relative electricity, carbon and costs savings of Economic and Carbon scenarios. The thermal comfort violations for each approach are also assessed, using a summation of the breach of comfort bounds across the testing period. For N simulated timesteps i of duration Δ t hours, deviations below the space temperature setpoint y sp are calculated using Eq. (11). This indictor is defined in [29] which defines an acceptable level of 70 Kh/yr, where 1 Kh/yr corresponds to exceeding the temperature constraint by 1 K for 1 h within 1 year. (11) Comfort violations = ∑ i = 0 N y sp , i - y measured , i Δ t Other than changing the weighting coefficients in the objective function, each MPC scenario is analysed in the same way. Firstly, the building thermal model is fit on 1 month of data from 01/11/21 \u2013 01/12/21, using a data resolution of 1 min to align with the frequency of the baseline PI controller. Next the thermal control model, Eq. (3), for the MPC scheme is fit using measured HVAC heat duties and external temperatures, as well as predicted internal temperatures from the fitted building thermal network. Then each scenario is simulated for two months from 01/12/21 \u2013 01/02/22 using the simulation environment, with an MPC timestep of one hour and a forecast horizon of 12 h. Although cost and savings data has been collected from this case study, usable data is only available for this three-month period in winter. This prevents a comprehensive economic evaluation of the proposed approach as we cannot quantify the seasonal performance of the MPC scheme, which prevents a clear view of the expected annual savings. In a subsequent publication we intend to give a more thorough assessment of the annual performance of the MPC scheme. 4 Results and analysis 4.1 Building thermal model After training, the building thermal model was validated by plotting its internal temperature predictions against the measured values over the first two weeks in December, shown in Fig. 9 . The measured internal temperature varies between 16 °C when the building is unoccupied, raising up to around 19 °C during occupied periods. The external temperature has a noticeable impact on internal temperature, for example day two with an ambient temperature below 0 °C results in an internal temperature of just 18 °C, 1 °C below the desired setpoint. Similarly, day 13 shows a higher external temperature of 10 °C, and the internal temperature reaches 19.5 °C. Overall, the measured and internal temperatures agree closely over the entire period, with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.35 °C. The similar behaviour observed in the building thermal model and the real system allows for the control evaluation to be carried out in simulation rather than the real system. This ensures that identical external conditions can be applied in each scenario which is necessary to compare performance. 4.2 Analysis of control performance 4.2.1 Baseline scenario: PI with pre-heat To ensure the building is at an appropriate temperature at the start of the trading hours, the baseline strategy follows a schedule that includes a period of pre-heating. The choice of this pre-heat duration is pivotal to the performance of the baseline strategy. This can be seen in Fig. 10 in which the internal air temperature is shown for 4 days of operation under baseline control with 3-hours of pre-heating. Also shown are the heat supply and external temperature profiles with the occupied period (e.g. when the store is open for business) shaded in purple. On the first and fourth days, the air temperature is close to the set-point at the beginning of the trading hours, however, on the second and third day, the 3-hour pre-heat period is inadequate due to the colder external temperature and a period of discomfort results. Though a longer pre-heat duration would solve this, it would come at a financial expense and higher energy use, as shown in the next section. 4.2.2 Economic and carbon scenarios: MPC schemes A fixed pre-heat duration is not required in the MPC strategy due to the predictive nature of the controller. By taking the external temperature into account in the optimal control trajectory calculation, the MPC pre-heats the building by an appropriate amount in advance of the trading hours. This can be seen in Fig. 11 which shows the behaviour of the MPC controller for the same period as Fig. 10. Also shown in this figure is the electricity tariff. The MPC increases the temperature of the building before the daily electricity price spikes. This allows for less heating to be used during times of high price, however, as the building loses heat quite quickly, the potential for savings through such price-responsiveness appear to be limited without adding additional energy storage options. A comparison between the outcomes of the baseline strategy with different durations of pre-heating and the MPC strategy is shown for the full period in terms of comfort violations and electricity costs in Fig. 12 . By changing the preheat duration in the baseline strategy, a trade-off appears between comfort violation reduction and cost reduction. By heating only when needed and by incorporating price-responsiveness, the MPC achieves a better trade-off, with a level of comfort (approximately 0.11 Kh/day) that could only be attained at a higher cost if the baseline approach was used. The baseline approach with a 3-hour pre-heating duration would achieve similar comfort but would result in an additional $240 in electricity costs (1.7% saving), and 650 kWh of electricity usage over the 2-month simulation period, as shown in Table 5 . In the Carbon minimisation scenario, the grid carbon intensity is used to inform the MPC of times of low grid carbon intensity. In Fig. 13 , this is shown along with the building temperature, heat supply and external temperature for 4 days of the simulation period. The carbon intensity tends to be lower at night than during trading hours and as such, if it were possible to shift the heating load away from trading hours, it could be possible to reduce CO2. This doesn\u2019t happen, however, as the high rate of heat loss from the building would lead to additional energy consumption, negating any CO2 reductions made by exploiting the grid carbon intensity. Without further storage options, the MPC is then unable to exploit the diurnal nature of the grid carbon intensity profile. Overall, the Carbon scenario resulted in greater reduction in energy usage, achieving 800 kWh of savings, but a negligible change in the carbon usage due to reasons discussed above. From the two months of data analysed, it is clear that this specific building and HVAC system are not well suited to MPC. This, combined with having only two months of data to analyse, means a comprehensive economic analysis, considering total cost of ownership and payback, is out of the scope of this paper. The results shown correspond to a particular weighting choice. For example, by relaxing the comfort weight, financial cost and CO2 emissions can be penalised more heavily. To illustrate this, the economic and Carbon scenarios were repeated using different objective weightings, with the resulting KPIs shown in Fig. 14 . Generally, a decrease in cost or emissions is accompanied by an increase in discomfort, as expected. By allowing a certain amount of discomfort, the controller has the flexibility to improve other objectives. The most suitable balance between comfort and other objectives is subjective. Here, the simulation environment allows a suitable balance to be found by trial-and-error, however, without such an environment, appropriate weight selection is a topic for future consideration.. 5 Discussion The proposed MPC scheme allows for energy demands to be optimised in a manner that accounts for dynamic changing external conditions such as weather, electricity tariffs and grid carbon intensity. The case study presented illustrates the potential to achieve a better balance between comfort and cost against the baseline strategy. Nonetheless, these potential benefits are related to the level of flexibility available for the MPC to exploit. In the case study, the MPC could only store and shift the heat load by increasing the air temperature. As the building lost heat quite quickly, due to the high trading intensity of food retail operations, the level of flexibility provided by MPC is rather limited. To fully realise the economic and environmental benefits of MPC, additional thermal storage options would be needed or alternatively improving the thermal attributes of the building. This is clear in the Carbon scenario, whereby emissions could be reduced by shifting heat demand away from the trading hours. Such a shift would require more flexibility than what is available in the case study. The benefits of MPC must then be considered as highly case-specific, particularly in terms of the thermal storage available, however, the implementation of the proposed approach would pave the way for flexibility technologies such as batteries or thermal stores to be added and incorporated. Unfortunately, the length of the trial of only 2-months long does not give us an annual performance outlook, results are just indicative of the benefits that could be derived from cold winter periods. Researchers need to continue monitoring and trialling MPC schemes across the year to obtain more firm results. It is worth emphasising that MPC results will vary for each case study as a function of the end-use services and energy intensiveness required in the building, as well as its operating hours and construction quality. A great spectrum of MPC research in building performance should be explored by researchers in this area, although much of the literature today suggests a 15% savings is achievable. The reality is that results will greatly depend on the BMS legacy systems, monitoring capabilities, and overall features of the HVAC system in the building. In any case, the proposed approach is highly generalisable to different commercial buildings, and can be applied either as a retrofit to existing legacy BMS sites, as in this paper, or incorporated directly in a more modern BMS which already includes a remote gateway (integration approach). The retrofit case study shown here required a large capital investment of $29,020 for the required site vists and data collection hardware, as well as $5,400 for an external contractor to plan the incorporation into the building\u2019s existing BMS. By breaking out these costs using a real world pilot, we hope to reduce the uncertainty for future MPC deployments and highlight potential areas for cost savings. For new deployments, the authors recommend the integration approach where possible as it avoids the need for additional hardware installation, reducing the capital cost considerably. The main strengths of this approach are summarised below: \u2022 The MPC formulation is generalisable to all major HVAC systems as it calculates the optimal temperature setpoint which all controllers take as an input, rather than any system-specific actuator behaviour such as fan speeds/heat duties. \u2022 Many required input data, internal/external temperatures and AHU sensors (e.g., fan speed, heating valve position, etc.), are also commonly measured by all major BMS systems, or available through open APIs in the case of carbon factor forecasts. \u2022 The proposed software infrastructure can be replicated for a low cost of $6.39/month. Over 90% of this cost relates to running the MPC scheme, so this area should be focused on if cost reduction is desired. \u2022 The collection and storage of data is shown to be inexpensive, just $0.31/month for the 16 data points collected. This allows the approach to be cheaply scaled up to hundreds of points if a comprehensive monitoring solution was required. To deploy this solution in new buildings readers are encouraged to undertake a comprehensive site visit and check that any required schematics are up to date during the planning stage. This will ensure the system can be quickly deployed without any redesign or additional site visits. There are some potential downsides with the proposed methodology however, notably risking vendor lock-in to your cloud provider. Although different providers will typically offer the same microservices, an existing deployment would need to be reconfigured to work in the new eco-system, making transitioning to a new provider a significant investment of time and money. This could leave businesses exposed to price increases in the future, risking the financial feasibility of such an approach. Additionally, software and integration expertise will be required to setup the cloud-based system, even if an existing remote gateway is already present. Finally, at the time of publication the DarkSky weather API has been closed for free access, and so another source of weather forecasts for the UK would need to be used. The points discussed above highlight the expanding horizon of opportunities in exploring the benefits that can be derived from optimising HVAC operations in commercial buildings by improving their flexibility and efficiency via both control strategy upgrades and hardware architecture development. Real-world implementation over long periods is key to unlock knowledge, standardising the hardware architecture, installation, and maintenance, while demonstrating for good the actual benefits of smart strategies. Enhancing load flexibility in building services is pivotal for buildings to adapt to an ever changing environment. These factors can be changing indoor environment conditions of the building occupants, energy price fluctuations or the opportunity to better integrate new technologies such as heat pumps and thermal storage [30]. Naturally, as more intelligent building controls become prevalent in the industry, coordinating the operation of flexible loads across a large number of buildings should yield substantial benefits to the power infrastructure, such as the distribution network operators [31]. 6 Conclusions Smart management of HVAC systems is key to unlock energy, costs, and carbon savings in existing commercial buildings. Although many works have been devoted to developing smart frameworks, the number of real-world implementations remains limited. Hence, this work has aimed at outlining the main features such solutions should consist of to make them fully functional in real-world environment. Giving an outlook of how cloud-based solutions should be set-up, monitored, and verified hopefully will help in supporting the uptake of smart control schemes in commercial buildings. A cloud-based platform for enhanced model-based predictive control of an existing HVAC system was presented, using a commercial food-retail building as a real-world case study. The existing BMS was retrofit to allow bi-directional communication with the cloud, and the associated capital and operational costs were $34,420 and $6.39/month respectively. The majority of the capital cost can be avoided in modern BMS systems which support remote data collection as standard, making this approach a low-cost control solution. The MPC formulation is highly flexible, able to minimise either overall cost, carbon usage or a combination of the two, while maintaining acceptable thermal comfort levels for occupants. The economic optimisation is simulated on 2 months of historical data; it improves on a static pre-heat period control scheme, achieving the same comfort level for a lower cost. In this specific case study the absolute value of the savings is small due to the poor thermal performance of the building, achieving savings of 650 kWh, amounting to $240. Carbon optimisation results in negligible savings compared to the baseline approach. Overall, this paper demonstrates a highly generalisable monitoring and control framework for commercial buildings, elucidating the implementation and cost details which are currently lacking in the literature. It is recommended that further work includes live testing of the control approach to accurately quantify the total cost of ownership and potential savings of the proposed schemes. Additionally, the impact of building\u2019s thermal performance on MPC schemes should be analysed to understand which buildings can benefit from such an approach. It is quite probable that in some commercial buildings due to the thermal quality of the building envelope, air exchange requirements, and the occupancy patterns taking place the MPC benefits suggested by theoretical studies are not as significant as originally thought. This issue if not addressed adequately could severely undermine the potential that advanced control solutions could bring to the built environment. A complementary work of this research would be to investigate the hardware architecture standardization, crucial to develop smarter strategies. Efforts in this area would support building managers and the wider building sector in choosing cost-efficient IoT devices, in terms of both capital expenditures and maintenance costs that ensure the ongoing energy costs from running the building are minimised across time.

In this context, this paper presents a case study of a food-retail building in the UK, detailing the design, installation and cost of a generalisable model predictive control (MPC) framework for its Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system. The hardware/software solution to collect relevant data, as well as the formulation of the MPC scheme, is presented. By utilising cloud-based microservices, this approach can be applied to all modern building management systems with little upfront capital, and an ongoing monthly cost as low as $6.39/month. The MPC scheme calculates the optimal temperature setpoint required for each Air-Handling Unit (AHU) to minimise its overall cost or carbon usage, while ensuring thermal comfort of occupants. Its performance is then compared to the existing legacy controller using a simulation of the building\u2019s thermal behaviour. When simulated across two months the MPC approach performed better and achieved the same thermal comfort for a lower overall cost. The economic optimisation resulted in an energy saving of 650 kWh, with an associated cost savings of $240 (an improvement of 1.7% compared to the baseline), while the carbon optimisation gave negligible CO2 savings due to the inability of the building to shift heating to low-carbon periods. Findings from this study indicate the potential for improving building performance via MPC strategies, however the level of impact will depend on specific building attributes.",
