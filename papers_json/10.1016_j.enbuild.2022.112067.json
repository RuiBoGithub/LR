Owing to recent advancements in Internet of Things technologies, data-driven model predictive control (MPC) has received significant research interest as a promising strategy to optimize building operation. As the MPC performance relies on the model prediction accuracy, complex building prediction models have been used in MPC applications, despite their high computational cost for optimization. This study examines whether linear-form prediction models are reliable to support the MPC of residential buildings equipped with single types of heating systems. This study developed linear-form models, namely an autoregressive with exogenous inputs (ARX) for predicting the indoor temperature and threshold-piecewise models for the return and supply water temperatures. The MPC performance on the basis of the linear models was evaluated under varying prediction horizons and weights associated with objective attributes. A case study of a residential unit through the simulated virtual building showed that the proposed models achieved the high goodness-of fit values greater than 0.9. The resulting MPC framework achieved heating energy savings up to approximately 12% relative to a simple on/off thermostat or reduction of comfort violation magnitude less than 0.5 °C. The influences of weight and prediction horizon on MPC performance were also investigated. Keywords Model predictive control Residential buildings Autoregressive with exogenous inputs model Threshold-piecewise model Prediction horizon Weight 1 Introduction Model predictive control (MPC) has received considerable attention as an advanced control strategy to optimize the operation of systems in buildings due to its various strengths. MPC provides optimal control by using prediction models that predict the future trends of buildings, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. The distinctive feature of MPC is its capability to minimize a cost function through optimization in a prediction horizon using prediction models [1]; unlike a conventional proportional-integral-derivative control strategy designed to meet a single control target, MPC is able to provide flexible control that coordinates multiple control objectives according to the optimization formulation [2]. Building prediction models are crucial components of MPC that impact control performance, and the process of developing prediction models require a substantial amount of time for the typical MPC framework design process [3]. There are two major branches of building prediction models. A white-box modeling approach is based on energy and heat balance equations to simulate building dynamics, and a black-box modeling approach uses statistical models using the dataset of inputs and outputs. A main challenge in the white-box modeling approach is that considerable effort is required to accurately estimate the abundant parameters related to the building and system properties [4]. Black-box modeling requires a sufficient amount of data, but the prevalent use of Internet of Things (IoT) techniques in buildings for measuring and storing data has led to a bright future for implementing data-driven modeling approaches to building automation control [5]. Advances in IoT technologies have contributed to the faster development and implementation of control-oriented models, and the number of studies on MPC using data-driven predictive models has increased gradually over the past decade [6]. Another reason that the black-box modeling approach is in the spotlight is that the prediction accuracy from the data-driven models, which has a critical effect on the performance of MPC, has been shown as sufficiently reliable in many application contexts. Black-box models such as neural networks, support vector machines, and Gaussian process regression models show remarkable prediction accuracy when predicting cooling/heating loads, HVAC energy usage, and electricity consumption [7\u201310]. In a recent review [6], data-driven MPC showed an average performance improvement of 23% relative to rule-based control, although it varied depending on the target application, building type, and time period. Ferreira et al. reduced the energy usage by 50% compared to a constant temperature control system while maintaining the predicted mean vote within a threshold through neural network-based predictive control [11]. Using random forest models with a prediction error of less than 3%, Smarra et al. showed that a data-driven MPC controller could save energy by approximately 49% relative to a bang-bang controller [12]. As mentioned above, MPC as implemented with a sophisticated data-driven prediction model has shown significant performance; however, there are limitations when MPC is applied to real building automation control. The computational cost of optimization using nonlinear models is not negligible [13], as the usual optimization formulation with machine learning models is often improbable to be configured as a convex problem; applying global optimization approaches such as genetic algorithms [14], particle swarm optimization [15], or harmony searches [16] requires substantial time to obtain the optimum solutions. If gradient-based algorithms such as the interior-point method are applied to prevent excessive time consumption, convergence to the global optimum cannot be guaranteed [17]. Moreover, when updating the model regularly during the MPC, which is advantageous for adapting to environmental changes and handling parameter uncertainty in control [17\u201319], the computation power for model update could be burdensome due to the considerable computation load for estimating the parameters [20]. Prediction models required for the MPC framework should be able to capture dynamic system behavior that results from the properties of the target control zone and associated HVAC systems. Typical commercial buildings are composed of multiple zones to control and have HVAC systems with diverse layers of air distribution systems (e.g., air handling units, fans, ducts) or water-based plants (e.g., cooling towers, chillers, boilers). In contrast, residential buildings are usually formed with a few zones and are equipped with a few HVAC systems. The dynamics and interactions between the systems and zones can be relatively simplified in residential buildings as opposed to commercial buildings; thus, prediction models used for MPC in residential buildings can be estimated using linear forms. Moreover, unlike in commercial buildings, where building energy management system installation is gradually increasing, it is not easy to invest substantial expenditures to install an energy management system with an advanced CPU for handling complex models in individual residential units [21,5]. Therefore, in order to ensure the applicability and practicality of MPC for residential buildings, there is a need to apply an MPC framework with linear prediction models requiring a relatively low computing capacity. Simple grey-box models such as simplified resistor-capacitance (RC) model, developed with model-order reduction techniques have been widely adopted in MPC applications as they are computationally efficient to provide a global optimum given their linear form and more reliable than black-box models owing to its inherent physical relationships under cases of fewer data available for model training, [22]. However, while fully data-driven models could show improved prediction performance with plentiful training data, RC models do not guarantee prediction improvement with longer training periods [23]. A number of studies have shown the potentials of simple data-driven models, such as (multiple) linear regression, autoregressive with exogenous inputs (ARX), autoregressive moving average with exogenous inputs (ARMAX), and indexed ARX models, aiming to predict the electrical loads, indoor temperatures, and thermal loads of residential buildings or a single zone. [22\u201325]. However, except for Tabares-Velasco et al., who used ARX models in MPC to predict electricity usage for cooling and presented 30% savings compared to baseline setback schedule control [26], these studies only evaluated the prediction accuracy of linear-form models, without investigating their effect on the MPC performance in residential sectors. The complexity of the prediction models is not the only factor affecting the computation cost in the MPC framework; the prediction horizon length, a future time period used for the control optimization, heavily affects the computational load in the optimization stage. When the prediction horizon is N , the computational cost for solving the classical linear-quadratic program in the MPC is proportional to N 3 [27]. In addition, because prediction models predict the future based on the prediction horizon length, when the prediction horizon is extended, further predictions for the extended horizon length should be provided to determine the control action; however, further prediction errors exacerbated over the extended length can be induced [28]. Several studies have been conducted to select an appropriate prediction horizon for MPC while considering the computational cost [29], prediction accuracy [30,1], and control performance [31\u201333]. These studies have suggested that the changes in MPC results according to the prediction horizon are attributed to prediction discrepancies; nonetheless, how a longer prediction horizon affects a prediction discrepancy and, ultimately MPC performance has not yet been investigated. One of the advantages of MPC is that it is possible to consider multiple control objectives in the optimization formulation; weights associated with individual terms in the objective function harmonize preferences between the multiple objectives, typically energy savings and thermal comfort, and determine the level of trade-off between the conflicting objectives [2]. Some researchers formulated a single-objective optimization problem only with the energy term, which included the comfort range as the hard constraints considering the computation cost [34]. However, incorporating the comfort term as an additional term in the objective function could reflect the occupants\u2019 preference among conflicting objectives: for example, their willingness to compromise thermal comfort in relation to energy-savings [35]. The weight plays an important role when applying MPC to residential buildings, due to the variations in individual occupant preferences. In residential buildings, where the occupant has the authority to control the system, diverse occupant preferences can heavily affect the control scheme [36]. Several studies have revealed that energy consumption can vary from twofold to threefold, even within similar apartments [37,38]. From these results and considering the relationship between the energy consumption and indoor comfort level [39], the thermal comfort preferences can be quite different with diverse occupants. Considering these characteristics of residential buildings, Jin et al. introduced an MPC designed to enable equipment operation according to occupants' control preferences [40]. Therefore, it is crucial to examine the MPC performance with varying weights when applying MPC to residential buildings. This study questions whether linear-form models are sufficient to ensure the MPC performance for residential buildings, considering the dynamic characteristics of residential buildings where the zone size is relatively small, and where HVAC systems are less complicated than in commercial buildings. This study addresses three research questions. The first question concerns the applicability of linear-form data-driven models for residential applications with respect to one-step-ahead prediction accuracy. This study uses two linear-form models: an autoregressive linear model with exogenous inputs (ARX) for predicting the indoor temperature and a threshold-piecewise model for the boiler energy usage prediction, particularly the boiler return and supply water temperatures. The second question considers the MPC performance based on the developed models. The MPC performance is affected by various factors: multi-step ahead prediction accuracy, length of prediction horizon, size of the weight in the objective function, convergence to the global optimum. The last question deals with the effect of prediction horizon and weights, which potentially significantly affect the MPC performance. 1. Are linear data-driven models reliable to predict heat transfer dynamics in residential buildings? 2. Does the MPC framework on the basis of linear-form models show considerable performance for residential buildings? 3. What is the effect of the prediction horizons and weights on the MPC performance? Fig. 1 illustrates major MPC components that impact the overall MPC performance. This study investigates three research questions associated with these major MPC components in the following order. Section 2 describes the case building and MPC framework components in detail. Section 3 describes a procedure to develop data-driven predictive model, particularly the method for generating training datasets, data-driven prediction models, and optimization settings. The results regarding the model prediction accuracy and MPC results with differing weights and prediction horizons are presented in Section 4. Conclusions and further work are discussed in Section 5. 2 Methodology 2.1 Case description The case building for testing the MPC framework was a 38 m 2 residential unit for a one-person household in the Republic of Korea. We modeled one unit of the apartment in the energy simulation program TRNSYS [41] with the component type 56. Fig. 2 shows the exterior of the target residential building and floor plan of the unit. Underfloor radiant heating systems installed to provide heating to the living room and kitchen were simulated with an active layer module in TRNBuild. The type 122 was modified to model a gas boiler installed to supply hot water to the underfloor radiant system. When modeling the multi-family residential units such as apartments, inter-unit heat transfer affects the trend of indoor temperature in the unit of interest. In this study, we modeled one residential unit in the apartment building and set its boundary conditions assuming that the adjacent unit has the same thermal conditions as the target unit. For instance, the three units with the same thermal conditions are located as shown in Fig. 3 ; the boundary conditions of the east and west walls in the unit of interest were assumed identical to the surface temperatures of inner-side west and east walls in the unit, respectively. The boundary conditions of the floor and ceiling were calculated in the same manner. The building simulation model requires the occupant presence and electricity equipment usage data so as to reflect the corresponding internal heat gains and trigger system operation. Considering the stochastic characteristics of the electricity usage and occupant presence and their correlations, we utilized electricity consumption and occupancy (ECO) datasets [42,43], which are comprehensive datasets with real measured electricity consumption and occupancy detection data. The ECO datasets contained electricity load and occupancy detection data for six Swiss households over eight months. Although the occupancy and power usage patterns of Switzerland and Korea may differ, the ECO datasets were applied to reflect the variations in occupancy behaviors and electricity consumption in residential buildings. After extracting winter data, subtracting outliers, and separating weekdays and weekends, we obtained five sets of four-month occupancy state patterns and corresponding electricity consumption data. Considering the differences between the number of occupants in the raw data and the target building, we scaled the electricity usage of the raw data to a level suitable for single-person households using survey data [44]. 2.2 Model predictive control (MPC) framework Fig. 4 shows an overview of the virtual experiments in the case study. The TRNSYS model of the residential unit, composed with the heating systems, weather data, and ECO datasets, was used as a virtual-real building and used to simulate outputs for training the data-driven models. The simulation outputs used for model development were following: the indoor temperature ( T in ), return water temperature ( RWT ), supply water temperature (SWT), boiler water temperature setpoint ( bsp ), outdoor temperature ( T out ), outdoor relative humidity ( R H out ), electricity usage ( elec ), and occupant presence ( occ ). Each simulation used the climate data for Seoul. The data-driven models for predicting the indoor temperature and boiler energy usage were developed using the simulation outputs. We performed simulation through heating season (November ∼ February) with the meteorological data in Seoul, and the simulation time step was 15 min. The approaches to generate the prediction models are detailed in Section 3. After creating the prediction models, we inserted these models into the MPC framework. The virtual-real building was used to simulate the MPC controller under dynamic weather and occupancy conditions. The data-driven prediction models received the disturbance data (outdoor temperature, outdoor relative humidity, electricity usage, and occupant presence) in the prediction horizon and building states (indoor temperature and boiler energy usage) in the current step from the virtual-real building model. The optimization solver Gurobi [45] was used to provide the optimal solution sets within the prediction horizon using the prediction models. Subsequently, the virtual-real building model adopted only the optimal solution at the first time step and simulated one time step with the applied optimal solution. The virtual-real building model used in this process was the same as the virtual building for generating the training data. The MPC framework iterated the steps mentioned above. 3 Development of data-driven predictive control 3.1 Training datasets for prediction models The training datasets for data-driven models heavily affect the model prediction accuracy and predictable range. Accordingly, the design of the training datasets impacts the MPC performance. Considering the purpose of this study (evaluating the suitability of simple linear-form models in the MPC context), it was necessary to minimize the effects of the characteristics of the training datasets. Hence, we created datasets that fully covered the entire regime of possible building operation conditions in combination with dynamic weather and occupancy conditions. The control inputs of interest in this study were the boiler on/off signal and boiler water temperature setpoint. In order to create different combinations of these control input and disturbance values, a simple on/off thermostat containing the indoor temperature setpoint function was adopted to trigger the on/off operation of the boiler. When the randomly generated indoor temperature setpoint was higher than the current indoor temperature, the simple thermostat turned on the boiler, and if it was lower, the boiler was turned off. This logic prevented implausible control outputs from being generated; if the signal turn-on moments were determined entirely randomly, the boiler could turn on when the room temperature was already sufficiently high. Various combinations of signals and indoor temperatures could be generated using the following strategies: (1) maintaining the indoor setpoint when the signal was first turned on until the boiler was turned off, and (2) randomly changing the indoor setpoint at every step while turning on. Strategies for setting the various boiler water temperature setpoints when the boiler was turned on were similarly applied: (1) when the signal was first turned on, the boiler water temperature setpoint was randomly selected and maintained until the boiler is turned off, and (2) the boiler water temperature setpoint was randomly changed at every time step while the signal was on. Examples of the trends of the indoor temperature, indoor setpoint, and boiler water temperature setpoint when this strategy was applied are illustrated in Fig. 5 . Each of the two strategies for setting the indoor and boiler water setpoints generated four different control-related data collection strategies. Each of the two strategies for setting the indoor and boiler water setpoints generated four different data collection strategies. The combinations of the four strategies with five sets of occupancy and electricity usage data generated a total of 20 training data sets of four months each (80 months). The entire set of all the training data were used to develop the prediction models described in Section 3.2. 3.2 Data-driven prediction models This study used statistical models with low model complexity, specifically linear-form models, to ensure computational efficiency while obtaining the optimum solutions during optimization. To achieve the control goals, i.e., minimizing comfort violations and energy consumption, there was a need to predict the indoor temperature and boiler energy usage according to the control inputs and disturbances. The indoor temperature was predicted using the ARX model. The linear regression and threshold-piecewise models predicted the RWTs and SWTs, used as surrogate variables to the boiler energy usage. All models are estimated to minimize one-step ahead prediction error. 3.2.1 Indoor temperature ARX models are simple linear time-series models that use the precedented values of a target variable (autoregressive) and current and previous values of other inputs affecting the target variable (exogenous inputs) to predict the future value of the target variable. The autoregressive characteristics in ARX models contribute to predicting variables that are continuous and dependent on the previous values, and exogenous attributes are needed to describe the control system behaviors in relation to the external factors. A typical ARX model can be expressed as follows: (1) y t + a 1 y t - 1 + ⋯ + a n a y t - n a = b 0 x t + ⋯ + b n b x t - n b + e t In the above, y is the model output, x is the model inputs (also referred to as exogenous inputs), and e is the white noise error. n a and n b are the numbers of the previous-step model outputs and inputs, respectively. The indoor temperature of the zone can be a proper variable to predict with the ARX model because the indoor temperature in the current time step does not deviate significantly from the previous time-step values. Also, it is greatly affected by other variables, such as the control signals of the HVAC system, internal heat gains, and outdoor conditions. For predicting the indoor temperature with the ARX model, the model inputs x selected in this study are the control inputs (boiler on/off control, boiler water temperature setpoint) and disturbances (outdoor temperature, outdoor humidity, equipment electricity usage, and occupancy presence). The control inputs are selected based on the consideration that a boiler in a residential building is typically controlled with on/off signals and a water temperature setpoint. The outdoor temperature and relative humidity were included to consider their impacts on the indoor temperature [46], and these variables could be easily obtained without complex sensors. The equipment electricity usage and occupant presence data were used to determine the heat gains in the zone, as they increase the indoor temperature. In general, the ARX model complexity is determined by model orders ( n a , n b ), which indicate the number of model outputs and inputs used to predict the target variable. The best order for the model can be selected using several methods, such as minimizing the Akaike information criteria by testing possible order sets [24]. Nevertheless, there is no absolute method for setting the order of the model. In this study, as a result of testing multiple combinations of order sets, we confirmed that unifying the order to five ( n a = n b = 5 ) showed a suitable prediction accuracy. The arx function in MATLAB 2020b [47] was applied to estimate the parameters of the model ( a 1 , ⋯ , a n a , b 1 , ⋯ , b n b ); this function minimizes the error with a least squares estimation. 3.2.2 Energy usage A boiler consumes energy to supply hot water to a pipe buried in a slab in the underfloor radiant heating system. However, additional sensors are often necessary to directly measure boiler gas usage in real-time. To avoid installing costly sensors for measuring the boiler gas usage in real-building applications, we indirectly calculated the boiler gas usage from the boiler's inlet and outlet water temperature measurements. Installing surface temperature sensors is much less expensive and requires no intrusive sensor installation in comparison to gas meters. The differences between the boiler inlet water temperature and outlet water temperature were used to determine the boiler gas usage. Dong applied this idea to a real building by replacing the boiler energy usage data with differences in the water temperature from measuring the boiler inlet and outlet pipe surface temperatures [48]. In our study, the water temperature leaving the boiler and supplying to the underfloor was denoted as the SWT, and returning to the boiler after circulating in the underfloor was denoted as the RWT. The boiler gas usage was assumed to be proportional to the difference between the SWT and RWT, and did not consider the performance curve of the boiler. Developing linear-form models for the boiler water temperatures started from understanding the operation mechanisms of the boiler and underfloor radiant heating system. Fig. 6 summarizes the operation of the underfloor heating system; the RWT cools down from the SWT while passing through the underfloor that exchanges radiant heat with the zone, and the SWT heats up from the RWT by the boiler. As shown in Fig. 6, the SWT depends on the RWT and boiler operation state; and the RWT depends on the SWT and the indoor temperature. Hence the SWT could be predicted by the RWT and the boiler setpoint temperature, and the RWT could be predicted with the SWT and indoor temperature. 3.2.3 Supply water temperature Based on the heat supply dynamics in Fig. 6, Fig. 7 shows the trend of the SWT to check whether linear models as the function of the RWT and boiler setpoint temperature are suitable to predict the SWT. The SWT shows the considerably discrete trend that could not be captured by a simple linear model. Only when the signal is off, the trend is perfectly linear. The reason for this trend is apparent; when the boiler is off, the boiler does not work to heat the water, so the SWT is the same as the RWT. When the boiler is on, the slope is not linear, and there are points where the line slope is drastically changed in each boiler setpoint. To take a closer look at this trend according to the boiler setpoint, Fig. 7 illustrates the trend of SWT when the boiler setpoint is 45 °C. In Fig. 7, the boiler operation regime can be divided into three sections based on the behavior of the SWT when the RWT increases. Section A indicates that the SWT increases from the RWT when the boiler is turned on. Considering that the boiler setpoint temperature is 45 °C in Fig. 7 and that the SWT is below the boiler setpoint, it can be seen that the boiler operated at its maximum capacity until the SWT reaches the boiler setpoint. In section B, where the SWT reaches the boiler setpoint, the boiler gradually decreases the heating rate to maintain the SWT at the boiler setpoint. From the beginning of section C, the SWT increases and becomes higher the boiler water temperature due to the minimum partial load operation when the boiler is on. Therefore, we created a piecewise linear model with using the signal state as a threshold in order to model different trends of the SWT depending on the signal state (threshold) and regions of the input data (piecewise). We denoted this model as a threshold-piecewise model. The threshold-piecewise model is defined below, and α 1 and α 2 for the case study were derived from the training dataset. These two parameters are related to the maximum and minimum operation capacities of the boiler and can be estimated with information about the boiler without efforts in collecting boiler operation data. S W T t = R W T t s i g t = 0 ( 2 ) α 1 + R W T t s i g t = 1 , R W T t < B S P t - α 1 (Section A in Fig.7) ( 3 ) B S P t s i g t = 1 , R W T t < B S P t - α 2 (Section B in Fig.7) ( 4 ) α 2 + R W T t s i g t = 1 , R W T t ≥ B S P t - α 2 (Section C in Fig.7) ( 5 ) 3.2.4 Return water temperature Like the SWT, Fig. 8 illustrates the trend of the RWT to test the suitability of a linear model for predicting the RWT. Considering some time duration required to distribute heat to the zone and change the SWT to RWT, the RWT in the next time step t + 1 was plotted in relation to the SWT in the time step t in Fig. 8. Overall the trend shows discrete patterns. Fig. 9 shows the trend of the RWT when the signal is off. Although the RWT in time step t + 1 shows a strong linear trend to the SWT in time step t , the variance of the RWT under the same SWT is observed that is due to different indoor temperatures. Therefore, we developed a linear model to predict the RWT in time step t + 1 in terms of the SWT and indoor temperature in time step t for the signal-off case. Among all the signal-on cases with varying boiler setpoints, Fig. 10 presents the trend of the RWT in relation to the SWT and indoor temperature when the boiler setpoint is 45 °C. The RWT trend is divided into three sections: the SWT is lower, equal, or higher than the boiler setpoint. This criterion is the same as that creating the three distinctive sections in Fig. 7. Sections A, B, and C in Fig. 7 are defined with the RWT as an independent variable and the boiler setpoint as a threshold. Similar to the SWT model, we developed a threshold-piecewise model as the function of the SWT and indoor temperature with the boiler setpoint as a threshold as defined below. β are the parameters of the models in each section. R W T t + 1 = β 0 R 1 + β 1 R 1 S W T t + β 2 R 1 T i n t s i g t = 0 ( 6 ) β 0 R 2 + β 1 R 2 S W T t + β 2 R 2 T i n t s i g t = 1 , R W T t < B S P t - α 1 (Section A in Fig.10) ( 7 ) β 0 R 3 + β 1 R 3 S W T t + β 2 R 3 T i n t s i g t = 1 , R W T t < B S P t - α 2 (Section B in Fig.10) ( 8 ) β 0 R 4 + β 1 R 4 S W T t + β 2 R 4 T i n t s i g t = 1 , R W T t ≥ B S P t - α 2 (Section C in Fig.10) ( 9 ) 3.3 Control optimization The objective of the control optimization in this study was to minimize the thermal discomfort of the occupants in the zone and boiler energy usage. Mixed integer quadratic programming (MIQP) was applied due to integer variables used in the threshold-piecewise model and the control variable set. (10) m i n ∑ k = 1 N w · C V t + k 2 + m ̇ C p S W T t + k - R W T t + k (11) s . t . T in , t + k = f 1 s i g t + k , b s p t + k , 1 ≤ k ≤ N (12) RWT t + k = f 2 s i g t + k , b s p t + k (13) SWT t + k = f 3 s i g t + k , b s p t + k (14) C V t + k = 24 - T in , t + k · O c c t + k (15) bs p t + k ∈ 0 , 40 , 45 , 50 , 55 , 60 The optimization ran at each control time step t, where N is the prediction horizon, w is the scalar weight value of the comfort violation term, and k is the time step in the prediction horizon. Boiler energy usage was calculated with m ̇ and C p which are the mass flow of the water circulating in the pipe and the heat capacity of water. In this study, the boiler efficiency was assumed to be 100% in all part load ratio regions. We calculated the boiler energy usage as the energy term in the objective function because the target building did not adopt a time-of-use (TOU) rate for gas bills. A TOU rate and boiler efficiency were not used in this study yet, but the proposed control optimization framework is easily extendable to reflect both the boiler efficiency and electricity cost. f 1 , f 2 , and f 3 are the data-driven models for predicting the indoor temperature, RWT, and SWT as mentioned in the prediction models section, respectively. CV indicates the comfort violation level, and reflects the differences between the indoor temperatures and indoor comfort temperature (24 °C), and the objective used its squared term to impose a higher penalty when the magnitude of the comfort violation level is larger than one and a weak penalty for a smaller case. This MPC framework was applied to the target residential unit described in Section 2 in December. The control time step was 15 min same as the simulation time step. The SWT prediction model is a threshold-piecewise model, so to include if-else statements in the optimization, we applied the implies function in YALMIP [49]. YALMIP supports the development of if-else statements more effectively than general big-M formulations. The optimization solver Gurobi, which is efficient for solving integer problems, was implemented in MATLAB to solve the MIQP problem. We assumed that all disturbances (outdoor temperature, outdoor humidity, occupancy presence, and electricity heat gain) were perfectly predicted in this study. This assumption enables excluding the effect of the disturbance prediction accuracy and scrutinizing the effect of the building prediction models and MPC design parameters (i.e., the prediction horizon and weight) on the MPC performance. 4 Results and discussion 4.1 Model prediction accuracy This section presents the prediction accuracy of the prediction models included in the MPC framework. The accuracy of the prediction models used in MPC impacts the MPC performance, as it determines the effect of the control variable on the target variable during the optimization phase. The prediction model was estimated with the training data detailed in Section 3.1. To test the validity of the trained model, we tested the model with 50 different test datasets: combinations of 10-year actual meteorological year (AMY) data (2000\u20132009) and five pre-processed ECO datasets of occupancy presence and internal loads. Each test set is 16-month long: each control strategy in Section 3.1 applied to the 4-month weather and occupancy-related data selected from the 10-year AMY data and 5 ECO datasets. The average of prediction accuracy results validated against the fifty test cases are summarized in Table 2 for each scenario of different residential units with the following two indices: the goodness of fit and root mean square error (RMSE). (16) Fit = 1 - ∑ i = 1 n y i - y i ^ 2 ∑ i = 1 n y i - y i ¯ 2 (17) RMSE = ∑ i = 1 n y i - y i ^ 2 / n In addition to the case residential unit, we created additional cases with varying thermal conditions in order to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed linear-form models for residential applications equipped with underfloor radiant heating systems. On the basis of the case residential unit (referred to as Scenario 1), we created four cases with varying exterior envelope thermal property, boiler system size, building boundary conditions, and heated floor area as summarized in Table 1 . While Scenario 1 is one of existing apartments, the wall thermal properties of Scenario 2 follow the national energy-saving design standards in 2020. Scenario 3 has an increased boiler capacity to test whether the threshold linear model accurately predicts the behavior of over-sized heating systems. Scenario 4 is the residential unit with different boundary conditions; it is the stand-alone house while Scenario 1 is the unit adjacent to neighboring units. Scenario 5 is a residential unit with a larger floor area (three-bedroom apartment unit) than the one-bedroom unit used for the original case unit. The boiler capacity in Scenario 5 was sized to reflect the increased unit floor area. The statistical indices in Table 2 suggest that all models show considerable prediction accuracy. The goodness-of-fit values for the three models are higher than 0.9, and MAE and RMSE values are less than 1. Fig. 11 illustrates the distribution of the goodness-of-fit of the indoor temperature prediction model under 50 test cases as an example to highlight possible variation in the prediction accuracy due to different test datasets. Although the prediction accuracy slightly varies depending on the test dataset, Fig. 11 shows the high prediction accuracy of the suggested model under different weather and occupancy conditions. Fig. 12 illustrates the trends of the measured and predicted values of the target variables in specific steps in Scenario 5, which shows the slightly lower prediction accuracy among the five scenarios. The figure confirms the high prediction accuracy of three models for both boiler operation modes: whether the boiler is on or off. Therefore, the prediction models on the basis of linear-forms were confirmed to sufficiently predict the heat transfer dynamics in residential buildings. 4.2 MPC results Based on considerable prediction accuracy suggested in Section 4.1, the proposed MPC framework applied prediction models estimated by training data combined with four control inputs strategies, five occupancy and electricity schedules under four months of typical metrological year (TMY) weather data. The overall performance of the developed MPC framework was summarized by the two indicators: the sum of squared comfort violation values during occupied hours and energy usage over the testing period of 1 month as follows: (18) CV = ∑ i N sim T in , i - 24 2 · O c c i N occ (19) Engy = ∑ i N sim m ̇ C p S W T i - R W T i In the above, N sim is the number of simulation time steps, N occ is the number of time steps when the zone is occupied, Oc c i is 0 when the zone is not occupied and 1 when occupied in time step i , m ̇ is the mass flow of the water circulating in the pipe, and C p is the heat capacity of water. The discomfort performance indicator was normalized by the total number of occupied hours to represent the magnitude of average discomfort degree in the squared value. The MPC performance was compared against a simple on/off thermostat. The simple thermostat turns on the boiler with the fixed boiler water temperature setpoint of 60 °C to maintain the indoor temperature at approximately 24 °C when an occupant is in the zone. 4.2.1 Comparing MPC performance to on/off thermostat Fig. 13 illustrates the MPC control results under different combinations of weights and prediction horizons in comparison to the simple on/off thermostat. Different combinations of weights were considered to reflect possible variation in individual preferences between energy savings and thermal comfort and ultimately evaluate the potential performance of the MPC framework under varying preferences of individual occupants. The two axes represent the two performance indicators summarized in the section above, and each point corresponds to a weight and prediction horizon. The rightmost point indicates the minimum weight value associated with the objective attribute of the discomfort level, and the weight increases by 0.1 when moving to the left on the same line. For the purpose of intuitive understanding, the weights in the results were scaled by dividing C p and m ̇ from the actual weights during optimization. Fig. 13 compares the MPC control results corresponding to the weight and prediction horizon set against the on/off thermostat baseline case. The comfort violation of on/off thermostat C V on / o f f is 0.79 °C2, and energy usage Eng y on / o f f is 2860 kWh, which is indicated as an asterisk in Fig. 13. The points located inside the rectangle created by the point of the on/off thermostat indicate cases with the developed MPC framework under different weights and prediction horizons that outperform the on/off thermostat in terms of both performance indicators. In Fig. 13, different occupant preferences between thermal comfort and energy savings are reflected in different weight values associated with the objective attribute of the discomfort level. Those who are willing to compromise the average comfort violation magnitude of approximately 1.3 °C, the MPC framework developed in this study can bring an energy savings of 12% in comparison to the on/off thermostat (point A). In contrast, those who put far more weight on comfort can reduce the average discomfort magnitude to less than 0.5 °C while achieving an energy saving of 5% in comparison to the on/off thermostat (point B). In addition, we investigated existing studies applying MPC to residential buildings in order to see whether our MPC performance is comparable to existing MPC results on the basis of other types of prediction models. Tabares-Velasco et al. showed that MPC with an ARX model reduced energy costs by 5\u201330% relative to setback controllers, depending on the time-of-use rates [26]. Picard et al. developed an MPC on the basis of state-space models that reduced energy usage by 12% and comfort violations by more than 90% [29]. Salakij et al. used a reduced capacitance model to predict the HVAC system dynamics in MPC and demonstrated that the thermal energy was reduced by approximately 6% relative to setpoint control [50]. Reynolds et al. showed that MPC using an artificial neural network model saved energy from 7% to 16% in comparison with baseline controls with the same occupant schedule on the standard energy tariff [51]. The studies above may not have detailed settings identical to those used in our case study. Considering that the MPC performance of these studies may vary due to differences in the target control variables, MPC design parameters, and definition of baseline control, our MPC framework on the basis of the linear-form models showed a comparable performance while achieving a high computational efficiency to achieve the global optimal solution. Fig. 14 compares the control trajectories of MPC (prediction horizon = 4, weight = 3.6) and baseline cases for two days. In the two days, C V mpc , C V on / o f f are 0.45 , 0.71 °C2,and Eng y MPC , E n g y on / o f f are 65 , 76 k W h , respectively. The MPC maintained the indoor temperature under 24 °C, the assumed comfort temperature, while with the on/off thermostat the indoor temperature exceeded 24 °C up to 26 °C. This comparison highlights the proactive control performance of the MPC case towards disturbances such as a transition from unoccupied to occupied states. 4.2.2 Effect of the prediction horizon In Fig. 13, the closer to the origin, the smaller the value of the two performance indicators, implying a better control performance. One of the unexpected results in Fig. 13 is that the lines with the smaller prediction horizons are closer to the origin, as it was anticipated that higher prediction horizons would result in more improved performance. To analyze the reasons for the results, we investigated the behavior of the prediction models over the entire span of the prediction horizon during MPC operation. Fig. 15 illustrates the mean absolute errors of the prediction models for every time step of the prediction horizon (rolling-window analysis) under different lengths of prediction horizon. At each control step of MPC operation, additional rolling-window analysis was performed to apply the whole series of optimal control signals for the corresponding prediction horizon and compare actual and predicted outputs through the simulation environment of the virtual-real building. Then, only the control action and simulation results of the virtual building at the first-time step of the prediction horizon were applied to the subsequent step of MPC operation. These calculations were repeated to save all errors of individual time steps of prediction horizons while running the MPC. Subsequently, the mean absolute error value for each time step of the prediction horizon was calculated. Fig. 15 shows that the discrepancy in the indoor temperature prediction model increases with subsequent time steps on the prediction horizon. This trend arises from the autoregressive properties of the indoor temperature prediction model. For instance, the ARX model with parameters ( n a , n b ) of five as applied to predict the room temperature in the case study utilizes the predicted values at future time steps t + 1, t + 2, \u2026, t + 5 to predict the value of the following time step t + 6. If an incorrect prediction value is given at time step t + 1, this value continues to affect the predictions of indoor temperature at the subsequent time steps. As the result, the prediction errors that occur at the beginning are accumulated. The trend in the rolling window analysis in the Δ T water model is opposite to that of the indoor temperature. Δ T water was calculated as the difference between the SWT and RWT that could represent the energy usage of the boiler. Table 3 presents the prediction error (MAE) in different prediction steps when the prediction horizon is 12 steps. A value in parenthesis indicates the ratio of prediction error in each prediction step to that in prediction step 1. The error of the indoor temperature model increases as the prediction steps increases, but the error of the Δ T water model tends to decrease. Both models were estimated to minimize the one-step-ahead prediction error; but, when applied to multi-step ahead prediction, the trend of error accumulation is obviously different. Because the RWT and SWT models composing Δ T water do not have autoregressive characteristics, they do not tend to accumulate the errors during the prediction horizon. The main reason for this trend of error reduction is due to different levels of prediction accuracy depending on the boiler signal on/off state as shown in Fig. 16 . The indoor temperature model shows a consistent performance regardless the boiler state, the prediction error of the Δ T water model is relatively higher when the signal is turned on than when turned off. This difference in the trend of prediction errors is due to the characteristics of the threshold-piecewise model that predicts SWT as the same value as RWT when the signal is turned off. In addition, as shown in Fig. 17 , the signal usually turns on at the beginning of the prediction horizon. Consequently, the rolling window analysis trend of the Δ T water model in Fig. 15 shows higher prediction errors at the beginning steps of the prediction horizon as following the trend of the number of turn-on signals. As the prediction horizon increases, more future information are utilized to calculate the optimal control signal. However, when the ARX model was applied to predict the indoor temperature, errors were accumulated in proportion to the prediction steps. The magnitude of prediction errors was less than 0.2 °C throughout the whole prediction horizon. When threshold models were applied to predict the boiler water temperature, the on/off state of the signal significantly affects the prediction accuracy. 4.2.3 Interaction between the weight and prediction horizon The weight is a numerical representation of the relative importance between the two objective attributes when performing multi-attribute optimization in the MPC. The interesting point regarding the weight observed in this study is that the effects of weights on the control results appear different under different prediction horizons. Table 4 presents the MPC results with the same weight of 2 and the ratio between Eng y mpc and C V mpc under differing prediction horizons. When the prediction horizon increases from 1 h to 6 h, there is a trend that Eng y mpc increases as the result of significantly decreasing C V mpc . Furthermore, we examined the ratio between the two MPC objectives with different prediction horizons and weights. Fig. 18 shows how the ratio between the two control performance indicators ( Eng y mpc / C V mpc ) changes when the weights change for different prediction horizons. Because the weight in this study is a coefficient associated with the comfort violation term, increasing the weight resulted in both C V mpc decreasing and Eng y mpc increasing, and, consequently, the ratio increased. Under the same weight, the high prediction horizon cases usually showed a higher ratio (low C V mpc or high E n g y mpc ) than the prediction horizon of 1 h. This difference suggested that there may be interactions between the prediction horizon and weight that impact the individual effect of each on the control performance. The interactions may be due to different magnitudes of individual attribute values aggregated over different prediction horizons, but further studies are needed for accurate analysis. 5 Conclusions This study analyzed the MPC performance on the basis of linear-form data-driven prediction models in the residential building unit. We developed an ARX model for predicting the indoor temperature and threshold-piecewise models for RWT and SWT; these models were trained with unbiased and widespread datasets and showed acceptable one-step-ahead prediction accuracy. The MPC framework composed with prediction models and MIQP solver achieved considerable control performance: heating energy savings of 12% compared to simple on/off thermostat or reducing discomfort level of occupants less than 0.5 °C. The rolling window analysis was adopted to scrutinize the effect of different lengths of prediction horizon; autoregressive characteristic of indoor temperature prediction models and dependency on the boiler signal state of boiler water temperature prediction models could yield the different trends of model discrepancy along the different lengths of the prediction horizon. Investigation on the effect of the weight in the multi-objective optimization revealed that there would be an interaction between the weight and prediction horizon regarding the MPC performance. In order to improve the applicability of the data-driven MPC for the residential buildings, the following issues should be addressed in future research: \u2022 Generalizability of the developed linear-form models: The energy simulation outputs with several settings (e.g., unit size, boundary conditions, boiler capacity) were used to examine the suitability of the proposed data-driven models on different residential applications. Nevertheless, this study was based on the virtual-real building (simulation model), which may differ from reality (known as performance gap). For example, the detailed inter-unit heat transfer or thermal dynamics in the real world may not be fully reflected in the simulation outputs due to the limitations of the simulation model. In this paper, the suitability of the linear-form models was examined only in the virtual experiments. Hence, calibrating the models with measured data to better represent the reality or using measured data from real-world cases is necessary to fully prove the generalizability of the proposed models. A living lab of 8 apartment units has been set up and being monitored, and measurement data from the living lab will be used in further research. \u2022 Stochastic pattern of occupant presence: The proposed MPC framework was demonstrated under the known, dynamic occupancy schedule. Since a poor prediction of occupant presence could deteriorate the MPC performance, developing reliable occupant presence prediction models contributes to ensure the performance of the proposed MPC framework. The advance of data mining and artificial intelligence techniques have been applied for modeling occupants behavior [52], and integrating occupant-presence prediction models into the MPC framework was suggested [48]. The MPC framework proposed in this paper can easily integrate a new prediction model of occupant presence to reflect the stochastic nature of occupant presence in the control optimization process. \u2022 Potential interference by occupants\u2019 control action: In the residential buildings, the optimal signal by the MPC framework could be easily over-ridden by the occupants, unlike public or commercial buildings served by the central building energy management system. One way to avoid this kind of problem is by incorporating and updating individual preferences on the basis of user control intervention and feedback to the MPC framework, such as updating the weight in the optimization configuration. \u2022 Model training dataset: Most studies, including our case, assumed a full training dataset that covers the whole operational regime. Collecting an appropriate training data set for data-driven models is a crucial step to improve the applicability of data-driven MPC. Future studies on how to effectively collect initial training data set and when to update the model parameters are needed. \u2022 Eliciting weights in the multi-objective optimization: The weights decide the balance between conflicting objectives (e.g., energy savings, thermal comfort, system stability), and this balance may differ per occupant. Our case study highlighted the potential range of MPC performances under possible combinations of weights between energy savings and thermal comfort. In order to correctly reflect occupants\u2019 preferences into weights, future work is necessary to develop ways to elicit individual preferences from iterative feedback from occupants and combine varying weights among occupants within a household.

        "dc:description": "Owing to recent advancements in Internet of Things technologies, data-driven model predictive control (MPC) has received significant research interest as a promising strategy to optimize building operation. As the MPC performance relies on the model prediction accuracy, complex building prediction models have been used in MPC applications, despite their high computational cost for optimization. This study examines whether linear-form prediction models are reliable to support the MPC of residential buildings equipped with single types of heating systems. This study developed linear-form models, namely an autoregressive with exogenous inputs (ARX) for predicting the indoor temperature and threshold-piecewise models for the return and supply water temperatures. The MPC performance on the basis of the linear models was evaluated under varying prediction horizons and weights associated with objective attributes. A case study of a residential unit through the simulated virtual building showed that the proposed models achieved the high goodness-of fit values greater than 0.9. The resulting MPC framework achieved heating energy savings up to approximately 12% relative to a simple on/off thermostat or reduction of comfort violation magnitude less than 0.5 °C. The influences of weight and prediction horizon on MPC performance were also investigated.",
