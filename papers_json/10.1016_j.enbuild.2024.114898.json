To achieve net zero emissions in the building and construction sector, there is a growing interest in how buildings can be digitalized to improve energy efficiency through optimal operational strategies to reduce energy consumption during the operational phase. The validity of the savings scenarios is highly dependent on the accuracy of the digitalized building model. However, considering the accuracy of the developed model determines the validity of the energy-saving scenarios, creating accurate models is difficult owing to the limited amount of physical data collected from buildings. Hence, in this study, a hybrid modeling method is proposed to improve the prediction accuracy by integrating the physical model results and operational data to improve the prediction accuracy for actual operating buildings where only partial data collection is provided, mainly for air conditioners. The hybrid model predicts the next day\u2019s room temperature by learning the difference between the simulated room temperature based on the laws of physics and historical measurement data. The results showing that the coefficient of variance of root mean squared error (CVRMSE) was 1.5% for the training period, a significant improvement compared to the existing RC model; moreover, the R2 was 0.93 for the hybrid model, indicating high explanatory power. In addition, an average CVRMSE of 3.8% in the period outside the training area was obtained, resulting in a model with improved prediction accuracy compared with the existing RC model. Similar results were obtained for design models without calibration.

However, while much effort has focused on the design side, with investments in building energy efficiency increasing by 16 % in 2021 compared to 2020 and the number of green building certifications increasing by 19 % globally compared to 2020, energy demand at the operational level is still high. In 2021, the energy demand in the operational phase of the building sector will reach a historic high of 135 EJ, with CO2 emissions expected to reach a historic high of 10 Gt CO2 [1]. With the increasing importance of energy management in building operations alongside green design, ASHRAE has emphasized the development and use of practical, repeatable, and verifiable methods for calculating energy use in heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems to reduce energy consumption. Interest in model predictive control (MPC) is growing significantly with the development of simulation models, with their use as a tool for operational decision-making proposed as a savings alternative [2]. MPC is a system that uses building energy models and optimization functions to derive operational plans based on predicted demand and operates more efficiently when linked to active systems such as envelope thermal storage or ice storage [3]. Consequently, interest in MPC is increasing, and several recent studies have demonstrated the savings achievable when equipment and buildings are linked to TOU pricing [4\u20136]. However, due to the nature of MPC, which determines the performance and savings according to the predictive performance of the model, it is essential to develop an accurate model with various data and information [7,8]. Therefore, interest and investment in maintenance systems that can identify the operational status of buildings in real time is increasing, and by 2021, more than 40 % of investment in the building sector will be invested in building energy management systems [9]. By digitizing buildings, it is possible to improve the interrelation between various components of a building, as well as to reduce costs in terms of preventive maintenance [10]. In particular, digital transformation of buildings and coupling them with MPC can significantly improve simulation capabilities and energy efficiency during the operational maintenance stage, since scenarios with control and other operational alterations can be pre-simulated with a virtual model before deployment [10,11]. A digital twin is a virtual replica of a physical object, and an example of the digital twin is a digital simulation model that can reflect its physical state and behavior by integrating the results of analytics such as artificial intelligence and machine learning with a physically based model [12]. In the building sector, there is growing interest in using digital twin models to help facility managers gain new operational insights and optimize energy consumptions [13]. For instance, Yoon proposed a new framework and methodology for building digital twins that can be used throughout the lifecycle, taking into account the unique characteristics of the building sector [14]. Digital twin is defined as a continuous process to build a holistic and omniscient environment for a target building throughout its lifecycle, and a framework is proposed to build it. The reasons why it is difficult to build a digital twin in the building sector include limited operational data and information, defects in operational sensors or equipment, and changes in energy demand due to usage patterns. For the digital twin model to be used during the operational stage, it will require continuous calibration of the model, generation of improved data and synchronizing the model by updating information. Clausen et al (2021) proposed a digital twin framework for implementing model predictive control (MPC) in real buildings and simulation models, and they applied the control to a university classroom [15]. The results showed that it is possible to improve energy efficiency compared to conventional rule-based control using strategies such as adjusting VAV dampers based on occupancy prediction algorithms, while maintaining similar comfort levels. Bjørnskov and Jradi (2023) introduced a modular, data-driven energy modelling framework that systematically links model inputs and outputs, and the method was applied to spaces controlled with target sensors [16]. The detectability of abnormalities in the operation of the target space components was verified, and the integration and scalability of the modularized framework were confirmed. Anders Clausen proposed another digital twin framework for buildings. This framework represents the controlled environment as digital entities. It also incorporates external weather conditions and current state information [13]. The unified model was applied to the heating and ventilation control of a university. This model showed that existing controls can be improved without affecting comfort or energy consumption. In this operational phase, the digital twin model must be able to represent the actual physical behavior by continuously improving and updating the uncertainty in the data while maintaining physical consistency. This requires not only the collection of the data to be modelled, but also the collection of data on surrounding, correlated variables, which is lacking in most commercial buildings. Especially in buildings, indoor temperature is an important indicator in terms of HVAC control because it is the baseline variable for controlling the thermal environment, and various modelling methods are used to accurately predict indoor temperature. Depending on the availability of data, different types of modeling approaches\u2014classified as white-box models (generally based on physical relationships only), black-box models (which are data-driven), and gray-box models (which calibrate parameters to improve the accuracy of the physical model)\u2014are used to predict indoor temperatures [17]. The simulation results of white-box models based on blueprints can be used as an important tool in the design stage because the results are explainable according to the input values, but its use has limitations in the operation stage because the results may differ from the actual consumption due to the assumption of various input variables. Black-box models have relatively high prediction accuracy compared to white-box models, but performance prediction is not guaranteed when the data used for training is outside the operating area [18], so unless training data is obtained from various operating areas, the model is limited in its application as a digital twin model that requires physical consistency. Gray-box models reflect data characteristics based on physical correlation [19]; therefore, they can be used as a good modeling tool when physical information about the building envelope, operational schedules, and measurement data is limited [20]. Oh et al. [21] proposed a method to calibrate the load and transferred energy by heat exchangers with an RC model using only the thermal environment data of the workplace and compared the RC model with the initial white-box model at the supply air temperature and room temperature. The analysis showed that fuel consumption predictions improved owing to the increased explanatory power of the entire system, not just the directly calibrated air supply and room temperature. Gray-box models are suitable for predicting general trends in buildings in scarce data environments, but they are limited in their ability to predict detailed results because they fit overall values over the optimization period with limited parameters and model structures. It is essential to have such accurate forecasting in order to maintain control of energy demand, as room temperature is directly related to heating and cooling supply. For large office buildings, there is a potential for energy savings of approximately 7\u201311.5 %, depending on indoor temperature control [22]. Recently, research has been conducted on various forms of hybrid models to improve the model prediction performance. Han et al. [23] proposed a physical data fusion modeling (PFM) method to evaluate energy consumption by setting a physical model in the form of an equation with some key parameters and validated the method on an office building in a high-tech park. Modifying the key parameters of the model or the structure of the submodel based on LSTM improves the existing black-box model, demonstrating an accuracy of more than 90 % when data are scarce. Cheng et al. [24] proposed a hybrid model (SIM-DD) approach to improve the prediction accuracy of energy consumption in situations where data quality is low and only a small amount of data is available and conducted a comparative analysis of office buildings. Using the simulation results from physical models, measured values, and data from similar types of consumption in the same region as the input significantly improved the prediction accuracy compared to that obtained using the black-box and white-box models. Wu et al. [25] proposed a method to minimize the operating cost of HVAC systems by integrating an equation-based physical model and a heuristic learning method for commercial buildings and verified the method using one week of operational data, observing a 50 % reduction. To improve the learning performance in data-poor environments, Oh et al. [26] proposed a method to build a physical model from blueprints and learn a data-driven model using simulation results as input. Comparing the next day's simulation results with the measurements for public work facilities confirmed a high prediction accuracy. 1.2 Research contributions Previous studies have shown that including physical information in the training of neural network models can improve their predictive performance [23\u201326]. However, developing models that include physical information for control purposes requires a lot of expertise and modelling time [27], so it would be more practical to be able to input physical correlation models in a simple way. Since buildings usually manage the peak load and energy consumption for the next day with a time interval of 24 h, the prediction horizon of MPC is relatively long, and LSTM, which is widely used for time series computation, may suffer from slope extinction and blow-up problems in long prediction intervals when training data is insufficient [28]. The model proposed in this study can learn more reliably by using the results of the physical model as input to supplement the time series information and contribute to data augmentation. Finally, while previous studies have combined network models with physical models to maintain physical consistency or overcome scarce data, the nature of buildings, which are affected by a variety of factors, may require multiple complex physical models. Therefore, inputting the results of a physical model, calculated according to boundary conditions that change during operation, as an external input rather than inside the network model will broaden the scope of model utilization. Considering an accurate prediction of the return air temperature, usually the target control variable of air-conditioning, is required to use the prediction results for operational strategies, this study proposes a modeling approach that can predict the indoor temperature of the next day on an hourly basis by combining the simulation results of gray- or white-box models with a machine learning model. The impact of the complexity of the physical model on the prediction performance was evaluated by comparing the performance of the white-box model, which was briefly developed during the design phase, and the grey-box model, which was calibrated on the load side, in combination with the training model. In addition, simulation results that already contain the time series characteristics of the building were used for training to enrich the data and improve the prediction performance. In particular, the goal was to improve model performance by continuously updating and utilizing data from the day before the forecast and using it for the forecasting, assuming that the model's errors and uncertainties are structurally driven. For that purpose, the model learns the difference between the current simulated value and the measured value, and then predicts the corresponding measured value when the simulation results for the forecast day are input. Generally, black-box models provide high prediction accuracy; however, predictions outside the training domain are unreliable. However, the proposed modeling method uses the simulation results from the gray-box or white-box models as input values for the hybrid model to train the difference from the measured value. These models are not included in the training period but are derived from physical causality based on changes in the boundary conditions. Therefore, the simulation results can describe the operational situation, and a certain level of prediction accuracy can be expected, even in the non-training period. In summary, the research questions for this study are as follows. 1. Can the proposed hybrid modeling approach use simulation results from physics-based models to improve the prediction accuracy? 2. Does the proposed model improve prediction compared with traditional black-box models when the amount and type of training data are significantly limited? 3. Can the hybrid model make accurate predictions outside the training domain without retraining? The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the research process, and Section 3 provides the measured data and modeling methodology. Section 4 presents the simulation results. Finally, section 5 concludes the paper. 2 Research process Buildings comprise zones with diverse uses and environmental characteristics. Additionally, ambient environmental variables such as temperature and insolation (which vary significantly over time) affect building energy based on different physical laws. To summarize the characteristics of each model described in Table 1 , while the black-box model was highly accurate during the training period, its learning performance was highly dependent on the correlation within the range of data acquired. Owing to these limitations, it is less useful outside the training area, although it requires a large amount of data over a long period. In contrast, considering gray-box models are based on data correlations and physical correlations, they can be fitted with less data and guarantee a certain level of performance because they interact with boundary variables outside the scope of the data used for optimization. However, this model is less accurate than the black-box model owing to the limited number of parameters. The proposed method is a hybrid approach illustrated in Fig. 1 . The machine learning model was trained to distinguish between the simulation results and the measured values of the white- or gray-box models. The model is divided into two types: hybrid with Type 56, which uses the TRNSYS load model Type 56 as the physical model, and Hybrid with RC, which uses an RC-based calibration gray-box model as the physical model. Two types of models were developed to obtain the required simulation results for the physical model, as illustrated in the figure below. The method proposed in this study learns from the difference between simulation results and actual operating data. This approach has the advantage of a gray box model, as it can build a model that can be explained with a small amount of data while still achieving high accuracy, even though the gap varies with changes in the variables affecting the load. Fig. 2 presents a conceptual representation of the predicted performance of the black-box and gray-box models before and after training with the hybrid model inside and outside the training range. The accuracy of the black model is expected to be higher than that of the gray-box model within the training areas. However, as it moves outside a specified range, its accuracy is likely to decrease. However, gray-box models are expected to outperform black-box models in terms of prediction accuracy and maintain a certain level of precision, even outside the training area. The proposed hybrid method is expected to outperform the black-box model when applied to gray-box models both within and outside the training area. This study proposes a hybrid model that supplies the hot water generated by the boiler to the heating coil of the AHU installed in the zone, as shown in Fig. 3 . The flow rate supplied to the coil is controlled within a range of ± 1 °C according to the difference with the return air temperature to maintain the set temperature in the flow calculator. Accordingly, conditioned supply air was supplied to each load model to calculate the room temperature. Type 56 is a component that can simulate the thermal behavior of a building consisting of different thermal zones and can be used in conjunction with cooling, heating, and humidification systems [29]. An energy balance equation based on the blueprints was used to calculate the heating and cooling energy requirements. This method evaluates the initial design model without operational data but requires a significant amount of input variables and domain knowledge to build the model. Furthermore, the practical application of the model is limited because it is not possible to input actual values for several input parameters, and even the most detailed model cannot reflect all physical phenomena, resulting in deviations from actual consumption. The RC model, on the other hand, represents the zone components as states with thermal resistance and heat capacity, and their interrelationships with their boundaries as thermal circuits. As the RC model derives parameters based on physical relationships, it can represent the target zone with defined relationships and has the advantage of being able to represent measurements better than Type 56 with less data. However, optimizing the physical parameters to represent an entire period with limited data is a time-consuming process. The modeler\u2019s experience is required to constrain the appropriate range of parameters, producing results not sufficiently accurate for MPCs that require precise control because they differ from the measured values. Type 56 calculates room temperature based solely on physical relationships. Depending on the assumed parameters, the measured values may differ from the actual values. RC models are suitable for learning because they have a small error in the measured values before the machine training is applied. Compared to the simulation data, the measured data is not the same because it contains many uncertainties that occur in the room. The hybrid method proposed in this study improves the accuracy of indoor temperature prediction by training the constant or periodic differences between simulation and data, as shown in Fig. 4 . For instance, the magnitude and pattern of errors for n-1 day may be utilized to modify the simulation results for n day that can be obtained purely from physical correlations. This study compared the effectiveness of Type 56 and RC models using their simulation results for training. The learning effect of the hybrid model was evaluated before and after the application of the proposed training method. The effectiveness of using simulation data for training was analyzed by constructing black-box models using only measured data from the indoor thermal environment, particularly air conditioning, and was compared with hybrid models. Finally, the prediction results were analyzed by applying the trained model to data that were not used in the training process to assess whether the model adequately predicted the measured values based on the simulated data. 3 Methods 3.1 Measuring data and model specification The target building is a 15-storey office building located in Seoul. The detailed envelope properties and occupancy schedule of the building are not available, but for the purpose of modelling, the envelope properties are based on the legal insulation standard at the time of construction as shown in Table 2 , and this usage profile is usually applied to large-scale office [30]. However, this information is only used to define the white-box model with Type 56. The analyzed building is a high-rise office building located in Seoul that is primarily used as an office facility. The building is heated by air conditioners on each floor, which collect heat from boilers controlled and managed by a BEMS installed in the mechanical room. Commercial buildings typically monitor and store partial data related to air conditioners for indoor environmental control. The target building also manages the control points around the AC, as listed in Table 3 , around the air conditioners. The measurement locations are shown in Fig. 5 . Further information on the measurement points for this study can be found in a previous study [21], and the simulation results of the calibrated RC model were based on this study. 3.2 Data acquisition and pre-processing This study utilized data from November and December, which covered the entire heating period (November to February), to train an air-conditioning system installed on the reference floor. The model was stored for performance evaluation outside the training area, and the remaining January and February data were used to evaluate predictive performance. To identify patterns in the indoor temperature data, which are often time series and cyclical, the sliding window method can be applied to a predictive model. In this study, the data were preprocessed to allow a single-step forecast with a 24-h window size, moving sequentially every hour. Black-box models are not guaranteed to predict performance outside the training areas. Therefore, they require large amounts of data and extensive measurements of control variables, such as room air temperature, which can explain the target variable. In this work, the black-box model uses SA, OA, solar radiation, and operation sign measured during the day before the prediction as input data to predict the indoor temperature. Commonly, an indoor model can predict room air temperatures by receiving the AHU load. As AHU load is a target variable in most of MPC scenarios to reduce that, this target value can be deduced from an inverse simulation by varying the room air temperatures. Thus, the model target variable is the room air temperature under given the AHU load. As the magnitude of variables is different between temperatures and energy, a small deviation in temperature may increase errors in energy. Thus, an accurate prediction in temperature is important. The inputs for the hybrid model were the measured temperature of the RA, simulated temperature of the RA, and the operation signals. Inputs ⓐ measured RA, ⓑ simulated RA, ⓒ AHU sign on day before forecast day, ⓓ simulated RA, and ⓔ AHU sign on forecast day as a double layer, are shown in Fig. 6 . In the 1st layer, the hybrid model is trained using historical data to distinguish between the simulated and measured values. In the 2nd layer, the simulated RA and AHU signs are used as inputs to predict the measured RA on the day of the forecast. 3.3 Hybrid modeling Deep learning constructs models depending on the characteristics of the input data based on deep neural networks (DNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM), and convolutional neural networks) [31,32]. LSTMs are useful tools for learning repetitive time series data. They used input, output, and forget vectors to gate the input and output signals [33]. CNNs are primarily used in image processing to extract features from data by learning the spatial correlations in the data [34]. LSTM is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), which uses the state of cells and input, forget, output gate structure to improve the problem that conventional RNNs lose past information in sequences with long time lines [35]. The building envelope has a time lag characteristic because it has a large heat storage capacity. This means that the current temperature is affected by the state at different times in the past, so the LSTM structure can be effective for learning. However, data that change rapidly before and after air conditioner operation, such as room temperature, can lead to poor prediction accuracy when trained using LSTM. To address this issue, LSTM was complemented with CNN [36] because LSTM can model spatial and time-related features together while improving the long-term dependency problem of CNN [37]. The performance was improved by combining the two models, as shown in Fig. 7 . In addition, because the driving pattern on the day before the prediction was different from that on the prediction day, the first and second layers were organized in a parallel structure, as shown in Fig. 6; thus, each characteristic could be learned. The training performance of an artificial neural network is greatly affected not only by the quantity and quality of data, but also by the combination of hyperparameters such as the number of nodes in each layer, learning rate, epoch, and dropout. In the training process, room temperature and operation signals have different magnitudes and ranges, which may cause bias and overfitting for certain variables, so it was normalized using minmax scaler, and the hyperparameters were optimized using GA (Genetic Algorithm) algorithm with nodes in each layer as individuals. The parameters obtained after 10 generations of optimization with a crossover probability of 0.7 and a mutation probability of 0.2 are shown in Table 4 . An objective function was defined during training to mask the off-operation data and minimize the differences from the operation data. 4 Simulation result 4.1 Evaluating hybrid model performance This study assessed the predictive performance of a machine-learning model by comparing the return air temperature prediction values before and after hybridizing the RC model and Type 56. The indoor temperature data for each zone during the heating periods in November and December were used for this purpose. The results are shown in Figs. 8 and 9 . Fig. 8 shows the relationship between the return air temperature, time, and outdoor air temperature. In Fig. 8a), the measured data show that the temperature is low at the beginning of operation because of the heat loss of the structure at night, whereas the temperature gradually increases as the system operates during the day. Before hybridization, the Type 56 model did not reflect the measured characteristics, showing a relatively constant temperature distribution over the operating time, whereas the RC model showed a slightly different but similar trend, probably because the Type 56 model, defined only by the blueprint, has a higher heat capacity than the actual heat capacity and is therefore less sensitive to changes in external boundary conditions, whereas the RC model is calibrated with operational data. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 8b), the RC model reduced the difference from the measured value compared to the conventional white-box model as a result of thermal resistance correction; however, both models before hybridization were defined as larger than the actual thermal resistance, which is less affected by the ambient temperature. However, after the hybridization of both models, the heat capacity and thermal resistance were found to be more similar to the actual values, presumably because of the hybrid model's ability to learn differences, whether positive or negative. Fig. 9 shows the simulation results of the two models, the RC model and Type 56, before applying the hybrid structure based on machine learning to the return air temperature, and the predicted results of the test set after learning, compared to the measured values. As expected, the simulation results for Type 56 without the hybrid showed a significant difference from the measured values, whereas the simulation results for the RC model were similar, but did not close the gap by more than a certain amount. However, after hybridization, both models demonstrated significant improvements in prediction accuracy. As shown in Table 5 , the simulation results for the RC model and Type 56 differed from the measured values by 4.47 % and 21.49 %, respectively. However, configuring the two models as hybrids significantly improved the prediction accuracy of the Type 56 model by 1.73 % and 1.84 %, respectively. The RC model already had a prediction accuracy of 4.47 % before coupling, which meets the ASHRAE guidelines [38]; however, the correlation was found to be low, with a coefficient of determination of 0.57. However, after combination treatment, the relationship improved significantly, with an increase in R2 to 0.93. 4.2 Performance comparison with black-box model Black-box models typically require many sensor installations because of their heavy reliance on the quantity and quality of the data used for training, which requires measuring the control variables that affect the change in the target variable \u201croom air temperature\u201d and describing the relationship between them. In situations where measured variables are scarce, such as target buildings, a hybrid model that learns the relationship between the control and target variables with a physical model and learns time-series characteristics and uncertainties with measured data may have a higher predictive performance than a typical black-box model. Table 6 compares the indoor temperature predictions of the test set by the black box and hybrid models with the RC model. The results demonstrated that the hybrid model outperformed the black-box model in terms of accuracy and correlation, thus confirming the sensitivity of the simulation results based on the physical model. 4.3 Evaluating performance beyond the scope of learning The proposed method is expected to ensure a certain level of performance beyond the training areas because of the ability of the model to learn physical relationships, in contrast to black-box models. The heating season data (November\u2013February) were grouped into four clusters, as shown in Annex A. Training was performed using only the November data, as it was found to have characteristics different from those of December, January, and February. Some data from December were used for validation. The results of evaluating the trained models using partial December data not used for validation, and January and February data are presented in Tables 6 and 7 , respectively. The black-box model showed good performance with a CVRMSE of 3.58 % for December, which was within the validation set, but was rated as poor for January and February, which were out of range, with CVRMSE of 19.82 % and 18.83 %, respectively. However, the hybrid with RC outperformed the black-box model with a CVRMSE of 1.73 % for December (included in the validation) and for January and February (out of range), with CVRMSE of 3.55 % and 3.27 %, respectively. The indoor temperature prediction results of the black-box model and the hybrid with the RC model were evaluated to have high explanatory power for the measured values, with R2 of 0.72 and 0.93, respectively, during the test period covered by the validation set, as shown in Fig. 10 . However, the evaluation conducted in January and February outside the training areas showed that the black-box model failed to follow the trend with an R2 of less than 0, whereas the hybrid with the RC model still maintained a strong relationship with an R2 of 0.8 or more. In addition, the explanatory power of the models was analyzed in the same way, and as shown in Fig. 11 , the R2 values of the black-box model in December, January, and February were 0.72, −2.79, and −4.60, respectively, indicating that the model lost explanatory power as it deviated from the training areas; however, the hybrid with the RC model in the same period retained high explanatory power, with R2 values of 0.93, 0.88, and 0.83, respectively. 5 Discussion Accurate load models are important for predicting system energy consumption. Most studies have improved model performance by calibrating key parameters of existing models through optimization. This can improve the performance to a certain level while maintaining the physical correlation inherent in the numerical model, but it is difficult to create a more accurate model for control. In the case of the hybrid model in this study, the prediction performance was significantly improved by designing the hybrid model to learn the difference between measured values and simulation results in order to use the physical model as input to the network model. The hybrid model performed better in areas outside of the training range, even when compared to the black-box model, which shows good model accuracy. Fig. 12 shows the outside air temperature distribution for November used for training and December, January, and February used for evaluation. November has the highest temperature distribution, with the highest probability of measurements around 12 °C. In contrast, the temperature gradually decreases towards December, with the lowest temperature distribution in January. Then, in February, the temperature starts to rise again. In this study, only November data was used for training and December data was used for validation and testing. As a result, the black-box model, which learns based on the given data without reflecting the physical relationship, shows low prediction performance for January and February data with different temperature distributions, as shown in Fig. 10. On the other hand, the hybrid model learns the relationship between simulated and measured data during the training process and shows high prediction accuracy without going through a separate retraining process, as shown in Figs. 10 and 11. As shown in the clustering results in the Appendix, the simulation results of the hybrid model have a structure that responds to changes in the inputs, including the simulation results, as the boundary conditions change. Since physical models cannot measure all the input variables of a real building, they use assumed values for some variables and represent physical phenomena through limited parameters and equations, which inevitably leads to differences from measured data. The hybrid model proposed in this work can learn these differences and include the physical relationships between them, which can significantly reduce the time and effort required for calibration of physical models. Furthermore, since the hybrid model learns constant or regular uncertainties caused by various and complex factors, it can be applied to multiple zones with the same structure and methodology without modelling each spatial characteristic separately, i.e., as long as there is data for that zone. Finally, they provide reliable predictions even in areas not included in the training, so you can trust the predictions when applying new control strategies. They can therefore be used as digital twin models for decision-making at the operational level. However, room temperatures tend to remain generally constant at typical setpoint temperatures, and this study did not predict tomorrow's air conditioning operation with active setpoint adjustment, so further validation is needed to determine if the predictive performance can be maintained in a dynamic MPC scenario. Furthermore, since tomorrow's room temperature patterns are likely to be similar to today's, further research is needed to determine if the same modelling approach can be applied to more sensitive data, such as system energy consumption or supply air temperatures. 6 Conclusion Due to the large thermal capacity of the building, indoor temperature changes are relatively slow in response to changes in control variables, so instead of optimal control, indoor temperature was controlled at a constant setpoint within the comfort range. If a digital twin model can be built to evaluate different control scenarios, indoor temperature can be controlled dynamically in response to changes in occupancy patterns and predictions of changes in the external environment, and MPC research is continuing in this area. Operational digital twin models require physical consistency between data collected from different measurement locations and the ability to continuously update the data to represent the characteristics of the actual building. However, the physical data measured in a typical commercial building is limited, which limits the ability to develop models that satisfy these characteristics. Therefore, in this study, measured and simulated values from the day before the forecast were fed into a so-called hybrid model to learn the differences between simulated and measured results, where the differences may include sporadic errors, periodic or regularly occurring unobserved operation information, and so on. In addition, the data generated from the simulation was contributed to maintaining physical consistency by using it for training. This research proposes hybrid models that use simulation results as input from TRNSYS Type 56 modeled with design drawings only and simulation results from a gray-box model, respectively. The characteristics of each model were compared and analyzed by measuring the operational data of actual buildings. The results of the Type 56 and RC simulations show that the hybrid model considerably improves the accuracy, with an error rate of only 2 % of the CVRMSE. The model also considerably improved explanatory power, with an R2 value of 0.93. The evaluation found the hybrid model superior in terms of accuracy and explanatory power within the training set, even when compared to a black-box model trained solely on data without using a physical model. The hybrid model maintained a high predictive accuracy and explanatory power, with a CVRMSE of approximately 3.5 % and an R2 of 0.8, even outside the training areas. In contrast, the black-box model lost its explanatory power beyond the training areas. The modeling approach presented in this study differs from previous research in that it uses simulation results as inputs to overcome the lack of data in typical commercial buildings. This study demonstrates that the accuracy of predictions and correlations improves when constructing a model using both simulated and measured data. Fitting the physical model did not significantly affect the accuracy of the final model. In buildings, the room air temperature is an important metric in MPC because it forms the basis for controlling the thermal environment. While this study focused on the accuracy of room temperature prediction, it is necessary to further study the accuracy of room temperature prediction when simulation results from the MPC strategy are applied to the hybrid model. In addition, if the hybrid model has explanatory power outside the training area, whether the predicted results can be trusted when the unmeasured control variables are changed is tested. We will also test the possibility of extending the application of MPC without installing additional sensors.

The data can be divided into four characteristics, as shown in Fig. A1. This classification is attributed to monthly variations in air conditioning and weather data. As shown in Fig. A2, the outdoor air temperature and solar radiation were clustered with a k-value of 4 and classified in a manner similar to the actual time. In addition, the cluster analysis of the data showed that the greatest disparity was in the outdoor temperature, as shown in Table A1. The clusters had average temperatures of 10.5, 3.6, 0.7, and 5.1 °C, respectively, indicating a significant difference between them. The lowest temperature in cluster 1, used for training, was −0.6 °C, but this did not include the lowest temperatures (−11.1, −15.2, and −8.5 °C) observed during the test period. The December data demonstrated a moderate degree of accuracy, as some of them were used for verification purposes during the black-box model training process; however, the error increased significantly in January and February.

        "dc:description": "To achieve net zero emissions in the building and construction sector, there is a growing interest in how buildings can be digitalized to improve energy efficiency through optimal operational strategies to reduce energy consumption during the operational phase. The validity of the savings scenarios is highly dependent on the accuracy of the digitalized building model. However, considering the accuracy of the developed model determines the validity of the energy-saving scenarios, creating accurate models is difficult owing to the limited amount of physical data collected from buildings. Hence, in this study, a hybrid modeling method is proposed to improve the prediction accuracy by integrating the physical model results and operational data to improve the prediction accuracy for actual operating buildings where only partial data collection is provided, mainly for air conditioners. The hybrid model predicts the next day\u2019s room temperature by learning the difference between the simulated room temperature based on the laws of physics and historical measurement data. The results showing that the coefficient of variance of root mean squared error (CVRMSE) was 1.5% for the training period, a significant improvement compared to the existing RC model; moreover, the R2 was 0.93 for the hybrid model, indicating high explanatory power. In addition, an average CVRMSE of 3.8% in the period outside the training area was obtained, resulting in a model with improved prediction accuracy compared with the existing RC model. Similar results were obtained for design models without calibration.",
