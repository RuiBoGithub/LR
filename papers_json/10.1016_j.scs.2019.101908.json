The significant energy use and resultant air pollutants emissions from the HVAC system pose grave concerns to the global society. The model predictive control (MPC) approach is found to be an effective and economic way to optimally regulate the operational parameters of the HVAC system. In this study, the authors focus on the control of the ventilation of the HVAC system under two objectives: minimal energy consumption and high degree of indoor thermal comfort. The authors present a first comprehensive study to investigate the influences of cost function formulations on MPC control of the overall performance, and manage to identify the optimal cost function design for the ventilation control. This study incorporates the non-linear power predictive model and PMV calculations into the cost function in addition to the traditional linearized power and PMV models. The results indicate that with non-linear power and PMV calculations, the MPC controller could perform much better in terms of both the energy consumption and indoor thermal comfort. By defining conversion efficiency as the ratio between PMV change and energy consumption decrease, the optimal control strategy, proposed by the authors, can lead to a range of 29.2% to 49.8% efficiency elevation depending on the application scenarios.

Therefore, enormous amount of energy, accounting for 40% of the total global energy use (Castilla et al., 2011), has been devoted to maintain a good indoor thermal comfort. Meanwhile, the tremendous energy consumption contributes to the carbon emission of China, which increase from 396.6 Mtoe in 1978 to 3053 Mtoe in 2016. (Wang et al., 2018) Thus, promoting the system efficiency provides the route to achieve building energy saving/decreasing greenhouse emission while not sacrificing occupants\u2019 living comfort. Among various methods, development of a proper control method on the operation of the HVAC (heating ventilation and air conditioning)is found to be an effective, feasible as well as a low-cost solution by many researchers (Ascione, Bianco, De Stasio, Mauro, & Vanoli, 2017; Afram & Janabi-Sharifi, 2014; Ascione, Bianco, De Stasio, Mauro, & Vanoli, 2016; Dussault, Sourbron, & Gosselin, 2016; Oldewurtel et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2018). Many efforts have been devoted to developing methods or strategies to regulate the parameters of the HVAC system to provide a more desired environment condition e.g. better thermal comfort, less concentration of CO2 (Deng, Feng, & Cao, 2018; J. Ren & Cao, 2019), formaldehyde (Zhou et al., 2019) and ozone (Shen & Gao, 2018)) while consuming less energy. Various approaches including PID (Proportion integration differentiation), ANN (Artificial neural network), PSO (Particle swarm optimization), MPC (Model predictive control) and etc. have been employed to identify the optimal operational settings for the HVAC system (Pintaldi, Li, Sethuvenkatraman, White, & Rosengarten, 2019; C. Ren & Cao, 2019; Shaikh, Nor, Nallagownden, Elamvazuthi, & Ibrahim, 2014; Toub et al., 2019; Wang & Wang, 2013). Previous studies from the authors have identified that the ventilation is the key part of the HVAC system. Ventilation rate influences the indoor temperature and air velocity, both of which are important components for indoor thermal comfort (ASHRAE 55-2010, 2010ANSI ASHRAE 55-, 2010ASHRAE 55-2010, 2010; Enescu, 2017; Feng, Zhou, Xu, Ding, & Cao, 2018). Ventilation also influences the heat load of the HVAC system, and in turn, alters the COP (Coefficient of Performance). Thus, ventilation is a hub connecting power demand and indoor thermal comfort of the HVAC system. The control algorithms can therefore derive the optimal ventilation rate sequences in terms of two important indicators: the least power demand of the HVAC system and the most indoor comfort level to achieve. 1.1 MPC theory The model predictive control (MPC) method is emerged as a feasible and efficient control mechanism to enhance indoor environment performance as well as maintain a lower level of the energy consumption(Mirakhorli & Dong, 2018; Yang et al., 2018). Compared to the conventional ON/OFF control method, which has been widely applied in the current HVAC design, the MPC algorithm is thought to provide a more smooth and energy-efficient control sequence (Afram & Janabi-Sharifi, 2014). The MPC has been applied in building area to stir the energy saving potential of actively controlled buildings (Ahn & Cho, 2017). Since it exploits the available information of weather, real-time indoor environmental parameters, time-varying energy price, occupancy and solar radiation(Schirrer, Brandstetter, Leobner, Hauer, & Kozek, 2016), MPC provides a viable solution to the optimization problem between the among different objectives. As shown in the Fig. 1 (a), the MPC method contains three types of variables: state variable(s) (xk ), control variable(s) (uk ) and disturbance variable(s) (wk ). The state variable(s) present the status of the system under control. They can be simply seen as the intermediate variable linking inputted control variables and control objective. Finally, the disturbance variable (wk ) represents the external influences on the state variables. In the case of the MPC control on the HVAC system, the state variable and disturbance variable are generally indoor environmental parameter (e.g. temperature) and external environmental parameter, respectively. And the MPC control method provides a prediction on how the control variables (e.g. ventilation rate in the case of the HVAC system control) will behave at each time step over the prediction horizon. The details of the MPC control for the HVAC system is given in Fig. 1(b) with mathematical expression shown in the following scheme. It represents the commonly applied the time-discrete state-space based MPC. The MPC consists of four main components: current state, dynamics, cost function and constraints. (1) C u r r e n t s t a t e : x 0 = x (2) D y n a m i c s : x k + 1 = A x k + B u k + C w k (3) C o s t f u n c t i o n : y k + 1 = D x k + 1 min : J = ∑ k = 0 N p - 1 l k y (4) W i t h c o n s t r a i n t s o f : x k ∈ [ x m i n , x m a x ] ; u k ∈ [ u m i n , u m a x ] The current state denotes the initial values of the state variables (e.g. initial indoor temperature), with which the subsequent values of the state variables could be calculated. If state variable is not directly accessible, a Kalman filter may be applied to measure the state condition (Široký, Oldewurtel, Cigler, & Prívara, 2011). The dynamics indicates how the state variable(s) changes with time. By linearly integrating the current status of the state variable(s), weather data and control variable(s), the state variable(s) for the subsequent time step (xk+1 ) can be derived (Eq. (2)). Afterwards, the control objectives (yk+1 ) is linearly derived from state variable(s). A, B, C and D are the coefficient matrices for the linear system. For the HVAC control, the control objectives can be indoor comfort indicator (e.g. PMV), total power demand of the HVAC system or a combination of both the objectives. Such dynamic system is called the linear time-invariant (LTI) prediction model (Castilla et al., 2011; Tang & Wang, 2019; Yang et al., 2018). The LTI based MPC has been widely researched since the global minima of a linear system can be systematically identified. Thus, the linear MPC reduces computational load, and thus, could be addressed with the classical optimal method such as the quadratic programming (Afram & Janabi-Sharifi, 2014; Cigler, Prívara, Váňa, Žáčeková, & Ferkl, 2012). In contrast, non-linear MPC could integrate non-linear modules but it have to face non-convergent problems as well as the tremendous computation load (Afram & Janabi-Sharifi, 2014). Finally, the control objectives are combined into the cost function within certain constraints and weights. Under the circumstance of minimizing the cost function, the optimal sequence of control variables (uk ) can be derived. The first element of control sequence is therefore applied to the operational part of the HVAC system. The cost function is further subject to constraints either from physical limit or the least requirement for system performance. The control actions derived from the course of the cost function minimization should be constantly met the demand of these constraints through the prediction horizon. Other constraints such as change rate of the control variable(s) could also be specified when necessary(Afram & Janabi-Sharifi, 2014). 1.2 Current issues in implementation of the MPC based HVAC control The first issue for applying the linear MPC for the HVAC control is that it requires linear correlations between the PMV indicator or power demand of the HVAC system, and the state variables such as the indoor air temperature and air velocity. Thus, many studies have simplified the PMV derivation by considering the indoor air temperature as the sole changing parameter while neglecting the variation of others, and thus linearized the PMV calculation (Y. Deng, Feng, Fang, & Cao, 2018; Fang, Feng, Cao, & Deng, 2018; Zhang, Cheng, Fang, Huan, & Lin, 2017). However, recent investigations indicate that considering only the indoor air temperature results in large deviations(Zhang et al., 2017). The air velocity parameter is also found to exert considerable influence on the level of the PMV (ASHRAE 55 -2010, 2010ANSI ASHRAE 55-, 2010ASHRAE 55 -2010, 2010). As for the power demand of the HVAC system, a number of researchers simplified its calculation to be a ratio between the heating load and the constant nominal COP (Biao et al., 2013; Pintaldi et al., 2019; Toub et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2017). Such assumption, essentially treating that the power demand is linearly changed with the heat load, would contribute to model mismatch problem (Aira, Fernández-Seara, Diz, & Pardiñas, 2017; Y. Deng, Feng, Fang et al., 2018). Studies have revealed that due to the changes in COP, minimal heat supply and minimal energy consumption of the HVAC system is not necessarily be attained simultaneously. Thus, constructing the MPC structure with the actual power using actual COP could increases the accuracy, and achieve the potential of control method (Deng, Feng, Fang et al., 2018; Fang et al., 2018). Another issue in current MPC research is the guidance for cost functions selection is lacking in literature. The cost function in MPC is closely connected to the desired operation of the controller. Different cost function formulations will export different sequences of the control actions (Castilla et al., 2011; Ma, Qin, Salsbury, & Xu, 2012; Široký et al., 2011). Researches have been conducted to investigate the impact of the cost function consisting of the power and thermal comfort tradeoff. M. Catilla et al. (Castilla et al., 2011) conducted the research on the impact of different strategies for the predictive control. They used two different control laws: the first was the sum of squared PMV value and squared temperature change, the second was the sum of squared PMV value and squared control variable value. They also tuned the weight of variables in the cost function, and found that the result changed significantly. It is important to note that such definition of cost function lacks physical meaning and the weights should be tuned when it is assigned to different environmental parameters. Further study to explore the impact of the cost functions is needed. Therefore, the authors will explore the influences of using the non-linear dynamics considering the non-linear behavior of the power demand of the HVAC system as well as examining the influence of considering both the air temperature and air velocity to derive the PMV indicator. More importantly, the research will provide the first-to-known study on how the formulations of the cost function would affect the performance of the MPC control of the HVAC system. The whole study is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the modeling part of the building and GSHP system. In Section 3, we presented the results of two different simulation scenarios employing MPC in two external conditions, which last for about 8 days and 12 days in winter season separately. We further revealed the impact of control strategies using power and PMV analysis. In Section 4, the conclusion and perspective are presented based on the results from the scenarios. 2 Modeling The main goal of this study is to explore the potential influences of the control strategies on the final optimization performance of the MPC scheme for the HVAC system. The authors will propose new control strategies in addition to the four commonly applied ones to compare their optimization performance under the MPC framework. Based on these control strategies, several cost functions can be structured for the MPC method, and therefore different sequences of the control actions can be derived. The corresponding optimization performance can be assessed through twofold critical indicators: achieved thermal comfort and power demand of the HVAC system. Fig. 2 illustrates the detailed scheme in this study to realize the proposed research goal proposed above. In this study, the authors applied the MPC approach to ground-source heat pump system (GSHP) to provide experimental guidelines for selection of the different control strategies. The GSHP system is selected as the demonstrative HVAC system because it is a promising energy-efficient HVAC system in heat-summer-cold-winter (HSCW) region. The MPC control for the GSHP system is realized through properly adjusting the ventilation rate of the fan coils while keeping other operational parameters constant. The ventilation rate fraction (VRF), defined as the ratio of the current ventilation rate to the maximum ventilation rate, is selected because previous studies from the authors suggest that the ventilation rate is a connection hub influencing both indoor thermal comfort and overall COP of the GSHP system. In our calculation, the MPC algorithm derives an optimal setting of the air ventilation rate for the GSHP system to run on. In the course of the MPC control implementation, three essential models are required: 1) the building model for indoor temperature and air velocity calculations, 2) PMV calculation model, 3) the GSHP power model, and 4) the design of the cost function. The details of the GSHP configuration as well as these compositional models will be elaborated in the following. 2.1 Configuration of the GSHP system The GSHP system to be implemented with the MPC method is illustrated in Fig. 3 . It consists of a 100-meter U-shape vertical polyethylene pipe as the underground heat exchanger, water tank, Trine WPWE0604 compressor and three indoor fan coils to disseminate heat/cooling. The GSHP system is located in a test chamber (Fig. 3) with the dimension around 90\u202fm3. Multiple temperature and air velocity sensors are installed onto the GSHP system and inside the test chamber. In specific, the soil temperature is measured with two sensor (da18b20) placed in the 50\u202fm deep soil. Industrial sensors PT100 are mounted to measure the outlet and inlet water temperatures across the fan coils. Meanwhile six spots at three levels (0.1\u202fm height stands for ankle, 1.1\u202fm height for the head in sitting posture and 1.7\u202fm height for the head in standing posture) are selected to for the air temperature and velocity measurements to provide information for the indoor environmental condition through the Metrel MI6210 device. The power for each unit of GSHP is also closely monitored through the AMC16MA power meter from Acrel Company while the real-time current is recorded by AKH-0.66/W-8 with an accuracy of ± 0.2A. All the measured data is transfer through the RS-232 protocol with 1\u202fmin sampling rate. 2.2 The building model The building model contributes to determination of the indoor air temperature and indoor air velocity for a given condition. For the prediction of the indoor air temperature for the test room (Fig. 3), we will apply a typical grey box method, RC (Resistance-Capacitance) thermal network for its simplicity and accuracy for the air temperature calculation. The RC thermal network method takes the advantages of the similarity between electricity flow and heat transfer, and thus proposes to use well-known laws in electrical engineering to solve the heat transfer for the specific room(Bueno, Norford, Pigeon, & Britter, 2012; Harish & Kumar, 2016; O\u2019Dwyer, De Tommasi, Kouramas, Cychowski, & Lightbody, 2017). The next step for the RC thermal network is to assign proper resistance and capacity values to the electric circuit. In this research, we applied the model recognition approach to obtain these parameters. The model recognition method involves four steps: 1) Construct the RC network for the test room; 2) Record the actual outdoor and indoor temperatures dynamics; 3) fitting network parameters with the actual data; 4) Validated the accuracy of the RC thermal network data with new temperature measurements. For the calculation of the indoor air velocity, the CFD (Deng, Feng, Fang et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2017) method is employed to simulate the air velocity change in the test room and the equation is presented: (5) v a i r = 0.0140 A C H - 0.0139 ACH is air change per hour and R2 is 0.9998. Since the air rate is time-lag unit in the building model, according to the CFD simulation, we assign a 20-minute delay for the stability of air rate change. 2.3 PMV and GSHP power calculation models The PMV indicator is a critical index in indoor environment satisfactory judgement. The indoor temperature is one of the most important part of the PMV index, while other environment variables, including the air velocity, relative humidity, radiant temperature, and the corporal state of occupant, including the clothing, metabolic etc., determine the thermal comfort level altogether. The complete PMV calculation is perplexed by involving multiple variables interacted in several high-order non-linear correlations. To guarantee the real-time MPC implementation, the order of the original PMV model is reduced to linearity by considering only the air temperature and velocity (see Fig. A.1 in the Supplementary information). The radiant temperature is regarded the same as air temperature. Typical clothing of 1.0 clo and metabolic of 1.0 met are assigned. The simplified PMV model is obtained through multi-regression. The detailed information is provided in appendix. To the power demand prediction of the GSHP system, the whole GSHP power system is divided into two part: the delivered heat ( Q l o a d ) at different VRFs; the actual COP and the actual power demand at different VRFs. The delivered heat correlation could be also integrated in thermal comfort model to depict the indoor thermal dynamics change over the ventilation variation. Then the actual power is formulated in the cost function which power severed as the optimization goal to decrease the system cost. (6) Q l o a d = a × V R F + b ∅ c = c × V R F + d P a c t = Q l o a d C O P a c t ( ∅ c ) The parameters in Eq. (6) is derived based on the full-scale experiments of the GSHP system (the detailed configuration of the GSHP system is elaborated). a , b, c and d are the coefficients derived from the GSHP experiments(Fang et al., 2018). P a c t and C O P a c t are actual power demand and actual COP of the GSHP system. ∅ c is the heating load fraction. Since the P a c t dose not conform to the requirement of the MPC method, we rephrase the P a c t using ployfitting and the result is in Eq. (7) and The R2 is 0.998. (7) P a c t = 2.2480 V R F 2 - 1.7998 V R F + 2.5318 It is important to note that the real power in operation may fluctuate around the proposed model due to random noises. However, the MPC control for the HVAC system generally does not need a high degree of real-time requirement. The MPC control for the HVAC system is generally operating at hourly, daily or even weekly basis. In such situation, neglecting the random noise is not expected to result in observable consequences for control actions. 2.4 Control strategies for cost function formulation The cost function presents the desired operation of HVAC system for more energy saving or higher thermal comfort. The control strategies, on the other hand, represent the mathematical combinations of the thermal comfort and power models, as well as different weight settings to formulate the cost functions. The cost function is related to the stability of the system which should be described with Lyapunov function. For slow dynamic system such as the MPC control for the HVAC system, the stability is guaranteed (Afram & Janabi-Sharifi, 2014). The cost function depicting the energy saving and thermal comfort could be formulated as: (8) m i n i m i z e : J = ∑ i = 0 p - 1 J i T h e r m a l c o m f o r t ( x ) , P o w e r d e m a n d ( x ) Subject to constraint: P M V ∈ [ - 0.5,0.5 ] p is the prediction horizon; x represents the vector of control variables. i represents different control strategies (Table 1 ). From Eq. (8), it is clear that the mathematical expression of the cost function (J) can exert great influence on optimization. Linear or quadratic cost functions are desired to ensure the identification of the global minima without significant computational capacity. In this paper, we consider six different control strategies in the formulation of the cost functions (Eq. (8)) P l i n e a r represents the linearized power demand model of the HVAC system. P N O M , the nominal power of GSHP system, is 20\u202fkW. T g o a l , the setpoint of temperature, is 23\u202f°C. P M V r a n g e and T r a n g e are the predefined acceptable ranges of the PMV and indoor air temperature, respectively. k is the weight ratio balancing the power demand and thermal comfort change. In this paper, the parameters P M V r a n g e and T r a n g e are set as 1 and 4 separately. The J 1 cost function implies that a linear correlation between power demand of the GSHP system with respect to heat/cooling supply. The MPC control in this case would export the minimal energy consumption as long as the solution sits within the constraint range of the PMV. The second J 2 , maximum thermal comfort strategy, is the thermal comfort-oriented equation, and the system would act to manipulate the PMV value as close to nil as possible without the consideration of the energy consumption. The third cost function ( J 3 ) is formulated with two items of the power and temperature. Employing temperature, rather than PMV, provides the control method with less computation requirement and benefits optimization algorithm (e.g. the MPC method). The J 4 cost function glues the linear power prediction model and PMV together. Cost functions from J 1 ∼ J 4 represents the traditional cost function designs in literature. These cost functions are made quadratic so as to apply the linear programming method to identify the global minima. Additionally, since the COP of the GSHP system is known to be non-linearly changed with different partial loads, it is worthwhile to investigate the potential non-linear behavior of the power demand triggered by different levels of the ventilation rate (Deng, Feng, Fang et al., 2018). Thus, the authors introduce two additional control strategies ( J 5 , J 6 ) incorporating the non-linear power model of the GSHP system. In cost functions J 5 and J 6 , the linearized power has been replaced with the non-linear power model ( P n o n - l i n e a r ). By introducing the non-linear power model, the two cost functions are expected to deliver more accurate results compared to the previous J 1 ∼ J 4 cost functions. J 5 denotes the minimum power strategy with the non-linear power model. It should be noted that in J 6 cost function, the power demand and PMV are normalized to the same range ([0,1]). With such a normalization procedure, the weight parameter, k, can be interpreted as the ratio of capability of energy saving converting into the improvement of the thermal comfort. It is important to note that though the PMV and temperature are employed particularly in this study, the cost function provides the strategy to balance the trade-off between power demand and indoor comfort. Other quality indicators, such as the concentration of air pollutants could be regulated following the same MPC framework implemented in this study. 3 Result and discussion The result section is organized as the following: first, the detailed RC thermal network is presented and discussed. Then, the MPC derived ventilation rate curves over time at different control strategies are derived with 12\u202f-hs prediction horizon and 12\u202f-hs control action horizon. The performance of each control strategy is presented, and then evaluated by analyzing the achieved indoor PMV and energy consumption of the GSHP system. Finally, a guideline for control strategy selection is provided for future MPC implementation for the HVAC system. 3.1 Building thermal network The building structures such as roof, walls, glass, floor and etc. are considered to be connections of resistances (R) and capacities (C). In general, a wall can be expressed as three serially connected resistances and two capacities attached in parallel (symbolled as 3R2C). A glass window is generally modeled as 1R and the indoor thermal mass is denoted as 2R2C. With modelling, the chamber of the GSHP can be converted to an electric circuit, and the heat transfer can be seen as the electricity flow driven by the temperature difference between the two nodes of the resistance and/or capacity. Considering the test chamber is first-floor room, the ground is integrated to enhance the performance, which is modelled using 2R2C. The resistance of ground model represents the resistance between deep and middle soil, middle and shallow soil separately. Moreover, the solar radiance is incorporated in the network as an independent heat gain (Fig. 4 ). To calibrate the parameter of thermal network and guarantee the accuracy, the surrounding temperature and indoor temperature were recorded in October and November. The heat gain from the solar radiance was assigned the typical values in October based on the database in the EnergyPlus software. Each parameter of the model has been initially assigned the typical value and calibrated using the recorded temperature data. The outdoor temperature, the recorded indoor temperature and the simulated temperature are presented in Fig. 5 a lasting for 5 days. Then, for validation, another 5-days period has also been demonstrated with corresponding dataset and simulation result in Fig. 5b. According to the recorded data, the test chamber has shown significant thermal stability, in which the indoor temperature varied about 2\u202f° resulted from 12\u202f° surrounding temperature change. To assess the simulation results, CVRMSE(Coefficient of Variation of Root Mean Squared Error) (Aftab, Chen, Chau, & Rahwan, 2017) and RMSE(root-square-mean error) index has been calculated. The CVRMSE index values are 1.47% and 1.70% for calibration and validation, and the RMSE index values are 0.3860 and 0.3745 separately. The CVRMSE and RMSE results indicate a satisfying modeling performance for MPC method derived from the simulation. 3.2 PMV∼power demand analysis from MPC control through different control strategies for the GSHP system In this scenario, the outside temperature is continually monitored by temperature sensors WFWZY-1during Jan.28th 2019 to Feb.8th 2019 for 13 days, which was the winter season in China. According to the records, the highest temperature reached 20\u202f° while the lowest temperature went around 2\u202f°. Within single day, the temperature difference varies from 2\u202f° to about 20\u202f°. Such distinctive surrounding temperature variation could be found in HSCW region in winter and demands high quality control strategy to maintain the thermal comfort with energy efficiency. To calculate the indoor PMV value, the initial temperature for the wall, indoor mass and shallow soil were regarded as uniform and set as the initial surrounding temperature. As for the deep soil temperature, 17\u202f° of the soil temperature was detected from the GSHP monitoring system and the middle soil temperature was set as the mean of shallow soil and deep soil temperature. Fig. 6 a and b demonstrate that the PMV variation and temperature changes are resulted from different strategies, respectively. The direct results of the MPC control were the VRF setting curve from the measured period of time in Fig. 6c. It could be inferred that due to the high heat load requirement, the VRF was initially set at the maximum level to rapidly adjust the thermal comfort from initially about -4 to the boundary -0.5. Then the VRF commonly decreased due to the rising average outside temperature leading to a decrease in the heating load. However, due to different control strategies, the resultant VRF curves from the MPC method acted in various ways. For the minimum power strategy ( J 5 cost function), after day 4, the VRF was set mostly as 0.4, corresponding to the minimum power operation while satisfying the PMV constraint (-0.5 to 0.5). Thus, the indoor temperature was measured about 21.1\u202f°C under initial 4.5 days operation, then fluctuated within 21.1 to 24.5\u202f°C maintaining a low-level thermal comfort and finally reached the upper thermal comfort boundary. For the best thermal comfort strategies ( J 2 ), as long as the thermal boundary was obtained, the indoor temperature continually increased and reached 23.1\u202f°C about two degree higher than strategy 2. The VRF was set to obtain the maximum thermal comfort performance at the expense of more energy demanding. The PMV value from J 2 cost function was maintained around the neutral level. For the weighted sum strategy ( J 3 , J 4 and J 6 ), the MPC acted more flexibly. The control action trajectories of J 3 , J 4 and J 6 were situated between the boundaries formed from the previous two control strategies ( J 2 and J 5 ) indicating that the power saving and thermal comfort had been balanced to enhance the overall performance. The result indicates that with the same k value (k represents the weight ratio between power demand and PMV), the strategies with PMV performed better than that with temperature. In particular, the power under J 6 was found to be 637.2 kW\u2027h, lower than the electricity consumption of J 3 . Moreover, it contributed to average P M V of 0.02, better than 0.05 in the case of the J 3 cost function. For the impact of integration of non-linear power, when k\u202f=\u202f1, J 6 saved 3.2 kW\u2027h (24.6% of maximum energy-saving) at the almost the same PMV level. Since the power was consumed by system and transferred into the supplied heat and promoted thermal comfort, we analyze the quantitative relationships on how the power converse into the thermal comfort by analyzing the achieved total energy consumption and the corresponding PMV value (denoting as the setpoint in Fig. 6d). As shown in Fig. 6d, the entire MPC control strategies ( J 1 ∼ J 6 ) could be divided into three categories. Category 1 denotes the control strategy demanding the lowest power required to meet the thermal comfort boundary. As in the setpoint of consumed power of 625.1 kW\u2027h which decreased the average P M V value to 0.36, and met the least thermal demand. The second category, representing the strategies with tradeoff, exhausts more power to enhance the thermal performance. Then, the last category, denoting the maximum thermal comfort strategy ( J 2 ), spends extra power to ensure the best thermal comfort. The simulation result indicates that the strategy 5, to maintain the highest energy saving while keeping the thermal comfort within satisfied boundary, requires the least energy consumption for this test chamber. Then more power had been devoted to promote the thermal comfort level by different managements. For control strategy 4, with PMV and linearized power, the curve decreased slower than the strategy 6, which means that the setpoint of J 6 k = 1 was more efficient than that of J 4 k = 1 . As for the control strategy 1, with linearized power, it failed to keep the PMV value within thermal comfort range, resulted in 0.58 of absolute PMV value and consumed 631.5 kW\u2027h, higher than J 5 ,the control strategy of the minimal power demand but using the non-linearized power model. In Fig. 6d, the lines between setpoints of J5, indicating the least power demand to keep the PMV level in range, to setpoints of J4 and J6 are revealing. The slope of the connection lines indicates the efficiency of conversion between power use and indoor thermal comfort improvement. By defining the ratio of absolute PMV value decrease to power demand increase as the conversion efficiency, it could be deducted that the |PMV| was decreased at 0.0323 (kW\u202fh)−1, 0.0250 (kW\u202fh)−1, 0.0266 (kW\u202fh)−1 for J 6 k = 1 , J 4 k = 1 and J 2 on the category 2, respectively. Thus, the result indicates that the strategy J 6 k = 1 is the most efficient control strategy in this scenario with 29.2% elevation comparing to J 4 k = 1 . Similar efficiencies of J 4 k = 1 and J 2 indicate the operations failed to promote the efficiency of system. 3.3 PMV∼power demand analysis from MPC control through different control strategies for an extended situation To expand the simulation to normal condition, the authors modified the coefficients of the test chamber. According to the \u2018Design code for heating ventilation and air conditioning of civil buildings (GB50736-2012, 2012), the convection heat transfer coefficient are 8.7 and 23\u202fW/(m2.K) for indoor wall surface and outdoor wall surface separately. The thermal conductivity is assigned 2\u202fW/(m2\u2027K) for the wall. Meanwhile, the ground part is assumed to connect to the air rather than soil in accordance with high storey building. The size of test chamber and the heat conductivity coefficient remain the same. Comparing with the former test chamber, this model is less thermal inertia of which the indoor temperature will change more significantly. We simulated the PMV and power change over another period of record from November 29th to December 8th. The simulation setting is the same as the scenario 1. The result is presented in Fig. 7 . The outside temperature started from 13\u202f° and the initial average temperature was about 16\u202f°. Then the average temperature increased to about 18\u202f° at day 3. After that, the average temperature decreased to 11\u202f° in the end. Significant temperature difference has been detected in this recorded period demanding a high control quality to maintain the indoor thermal comfort. Since the ventilation rate fraction is closely related to the energy consumption of the GSHP system, according to the VRF (Fig. 7c), the curve of power-saving strategy(J5), from day1 to day5, remained at 0.4 VRF corresponding to the lowest power. It is important to notice that at this period the indoor PMV variation was affected by the outside temperature rather than manipulated by the air-conditioning system. As for the strategies integrating both the thermal comfort and power demand (J3, J4, J6), the VRF curves, along with deliver heat, were increased to maintain high thermal comfort, though contributing to more energy consumption. The PMV curves (Fig. 7a) indicate that the minimum power strategies had the least thermal comfort which the value varied from 0.44 to -0.5 while the weighted sum strategies maintained the thermal comfort value around 0 with little fluctuation. The average absolute PMV are 0.3570 and 0 for J5 and J2 with energy consumption of 403.8 kW\u2027h and 414.9 kW\u2027h, respectively Then, the power and PMV are quantitatively analyzed to reveal the impact of strategies on the control efficiency. The total energy consumptions for this 8-day operations were 409.4 kW\u2027h, 413.0 kW\u2027h, 412.4 kW\u2027h, 414.1 kW\u2027h for J 6 k = 1 , J 6 k = 4 , J 4 k = 1 and J 4 k = 4 , respectively. And the result indicates that the least energy consumption is 403.8 kW\u2027h to keep the indoor thermal comfort within satisfied range. In Fig. 7d, the categories of J 1 , J 4 k = 1 and J 6 k = 1 were presented. The control strategy 1 not only failed to maintain the thermal comfort within the range, but resulted in more power demand than those of the J 4 and J 6 strategies. For category 2, the connecting line between setpoints of control strategy 5 and 6 decrease more sharply than the strategy 4, indicating a higher conversion efficiency. Furthermore, we calculated the ration of thermal comfort lift to energy consumption. The results were 0.0451 (kW\u202fh)−1, 0.0301 (kW\u202fh)−1 and 0.0324 (kW\u202fh)−1 for J 6 k = 1 , J 4 k = 1 and J 2 respectively, indicating that the J 6 k = 1 strategy leads to the best performance by achieving the low power and high thermal comfort, with an efficiency elevation of 49.8% comparing to that of the J 4 k = 1 control strategy. 3.4 Comparison over different strategies To compare the impacts of different cost functions on the control action of the HVAC system, the authors conducted multiple simulations to reveal the thermal dynamics of a test chamber along with the energy consumption of system. It has been presented that the control variables could affect the heating/cooling load of system and furthermore, alter the indoor environment. Thus, we simulated a test room thermal environment variation over the ventilation parameter change and then, correlated the PMV index change with the corresponding energy consumption. Moreover, in this simulation, the power model was a non-linear model for GSHP system and experiments data could be found in previous research (Fang et al., 2018) and the thermal dynamic was simulated using the RC thermal network which is provided in Section 3.1. To derive the PMV-power demand correlation, several prerequisites are proposed to simplify the process and encourage a clear result for reference. 1 The outside temperature is constant and solar heat gain can be omitted. 2 The test chamber is regarded as well-ventilated which the initial temperature of indoor thermal mass and the wall equal to the initial temperature of air. 3 The simulation result is the indoor temperature after 24\u202f-hs operation and the air rate is calculated through the CFD method. 4 The PMV value is calculated for winter condition under the assumption of 1.0met, 1.0clo, 0 wet and 50% relative humidity. The radiant temperature is assumed equal to air temperature. With the data of power and PMV variation, we analyze the result of each cost function and derive the desired operation under each strategy. In addition, the parameters P M V r a n g e and T r a n g e are set as 1 and 4, respectively and PMV constraint is within -0.5 to 0.5. The result is presented in Fig. 8 . The operation of the GSHP system is influenced by the outside temperature leading to various heating demand, and the cost of operational power. It is important to note that, with the change of outside temperature, the system could reach neutral environment with the lowest power demand. It could be deducted that when the outside temperature is around 11.5\u202f°, the energy consumption of system reaches the nadir value at 0.4 VRF with the indoor PMV value of -0.03. When the operation is above 0.4 VRF, the setpoints of the control strategies are similar because in this range the COP is almost linearly changed with the changes of the delivered heat. However, the divergence happens when VRF is lower than 0.4 since at lower ventilation rate, the COP of the GSHP system no longer linearly changes with delivered heat. The overall results of J 1 indicate that the linear power model failed to maintain the lowest power, as well as result in a higher PMV value. J 2 has the highest energy consumption to maintain the nearly thermal-neural environment. J 5 is the power-saving oriented strategy with non-linear power model, and it is clear that it works better than J 1 . The strategy J 3 failed to identify the optimal operation points compared to J4 and J6. It is because that J3 considers a single temperature value for the thermal comfort indicator. It neglects the beneficial effect of air velocity in the improvement of the PMV level. As for strategies of J 4 and J 6 , the results indicate that more power should be dedicated to promote the thermal performance when the weight ratio (k) is high. The result complies well to the physical meaning of the k parameter. It is important to note that when Tout is low and the system have to work under high ventilation, strategy 6 tends to save more power rather than promote the thermal comfort. Moreover, we calculate the average of the power and PMV of the setpoint over outside temperature variation to denote the overall performance of each strategy. The result is presented in Table 2 . According to the result of category 2, the efficiency of J 6 is 7.18 and 6.38 for k\u202f=\u202f1, k\u202f=\u202f4 separately which is higher than other strategies and corresponds to the high performance of J 6 in Section3.2 and 3.3. J 1 and J 3 contributes to efficiencies lower than best thermal comfort strategy( J 2 ), which failed to achieve high performance on neither thermal comfort nor energy consumption. J 4 performs a similar efficiency with that of J 2 , while the efficiency of J 6 is much higher reaching 23.0% and 9.1% for k\u202f=\u202f1 and k\u202f=\u202f4, respectively. The results indicate that without the integration of non-linear power, the setpoints of cost function may degrade the operational efficiency of the GSHP system. An uncertainty analysis is conducted to reveal the impact of unmeasured disturbance on the influence on the system operation. Disturbance conforming to Gaussian distribution has been added to the weather signal, in addition to the solar heat gain and weather prediction. The results of PMV and VRF are presented in Appendix B. With the disturbance, the thermal comfort decrease per kWh power is 0.0323 (kWh)−1, 0.0250 (kW\u202fh)−1, 0.0262 (kW\u2027h)−1 for J 6 k = 1 , J 4 k = 1 and J 2 in scenario 1, and 0.0406 (kW\u202fh)−1, 0.0232 (kW\u202fh)−1, 0.0242 (kW\u202fh)−1 in scenario 2. These efficiencies under scenario 1 are of great similarity to the values without the Gaussian disturbance. In scenario 2, though difference can be identified in the conversion efficiency, the result indicates that strategy 6 has the best performance leading to a 67.8% efficiency elevation comparing to strategy 2. Thus, with the disturbance, the strategy 6 remains the most optimal control strategy balancing both the indoor thermal comfort and energy consumption. 4 Conclusion and perspective In this paper, we firstly reviewed several typical energy saving strategies composed of linear power, indoor temperature and PMV. Then we introduced two new strategies with non-linear power to enhance the performance of strategies. By simulating the power and indoor thermal comfort change, a discussion over the effect of different strategies is presented in part 2. The result indicates that strategies with PMV and non-linear power performed better than strategies with indoor temperature and linearized power. To evaluate the impact of strategies on control method, we integrated the strategies into the MPC method. We conducted two simplifications on the actual power of GSHP system and the PMV calculation to ensure the solvability and affordable computation load. For non-linear power, ployfitting is employed to assure the convexity of cost function, while for PMV calculation, multi-linear regression is employed to formulate PMV index with air temperature and air rate. Such formulations of cost function enable optimization to be solved by quadratic programming while guaranteeing the accuracy. A case study is conducted to compare the effect of the different control strategies. In scenario 1, a real model of a test chamber is employed to implement the MPC approach for the GSHP system control, while in scenario 2, typical values for the RC network is assigned to stand for ordinary construction. The result presented the least power to maintain the thermal comfort within predefined thermal boundary and the power to obtain best thermal performance. Thus, three categories of power-to-comfort conversion process has been revealed. The strategy with non-linear power model and PMV( J 6 k = 1 ) performed the optimal operation with P M V value decrease of 0.0323 (kW\u202fh)−1 for scenario 1 and 0.0451 (kW\u202fh)−1 for scenario 2, higher than other strategies. Future study could be extended to the manipulation of other indoor criteria, such as the concentration of CO2, ozone and formaldehyde. Regulation for these pollutants can follow the general framework represented in this study after proper selection of the control strategy. Meanwhile, the linearization using MLR has been conducted in this paper to maintain the accuracy within variation range. Linearization over the correlation between control variables and air pollutants could be conducted as well.

        "dc:description": "The significant energy use and resultant air pollutants emissions from the HVAC system pose grave concerns to the global society. The model predictive control (MPC) approach is found to be an effective and economic way to optimally regulate the operational parameters of the HVAC system. In this study, the authors focus on the control of the ventilation of the HVAC system under two objectives: minimal energy consumption and high degree of indoor thermal comfort. The authors present a first comprehensive study to investigate the influences of cost function formulations on MPC control of the overall performance, and manage to identify the optimal cost function design for the ventilation control. This study incorporates the non-linear power predictive model and PMV calculations into the cost function in addition to the traditional linearized power and PMV models. The results indicate that with non-linear power and PMV calculations, the MPC controller could perform much better in terms of both the energy consumption and indoor thermal comfort. By defining conversion efficiency as the ratio between PMV change and energy consumption decrease, the optimal control strategy, proposed by the authors, can lead to a range of 29.2% to 49.8% efficiency elevation depending on the application scenarios.",
