Graphical abstract Carbon dioxide (CO2) based demand control ventilation (DCV) adjusts a building\u2019s outdoor air ventilation rate in response to indoor CO2 concentration to save energy while maintaining indoor air quality. Packaged heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning systems often contain DCV controllers with embedded proprietary algorithms that lack transparent performance data. A test method was developed to assess the ability of a DCV controller to maintain the indoor CO2 concentration at a setpoint in response to a series of CO2 generation functions that represent three different building occupancy densities and two occupancy schedules. Six commercially available controllers were tested to demonstrate the method and provide directly comparable results. The performance (in terms of CO2 control and damper movement) of each controller tested was compared to the performance of an ideal controller which knows the CO2 generation function. Finally, the performance of a proportional-integral (PI) controller with preset gains was developed and tested to determine the potential maximum performance achievable with this control strategy. The best performing commercially available controller achieved CO2 control (within 75 ppm of the setpoint) approximately 80 % of the time with damper movement slightly less than an ideal controller. However, most of the commercially available controllers had marginal or poor performance for CO2 control and damper movement. Two controllers had damper movement more than three times the ideal controller. Notably, a PI algorithm configured and tested by the research team achieved superior performance with CO2 control 92 % of the time and damper movement 1.5 times the ideal controller.

DCV gained popularity in the 1990s with the commercialization of low-cost CO2 sensors for heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems [1,2]. The strategy saves energy when outside air requires heating or cooling to maintain thermal comfort. Thus, it has the largest energy savings potential in very cold and hot/humid climates and in densely, yet intermittently, occupied buildings (e.g. classrooms, retail, theatres) [3]. Use of DCV is required in certain occupied spaces by ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 90.1 Energy Standard for Buildings Except Low Rise Residential Buildings, which is adopted as the Energy Standard for most of the US [4]. ASHRAE 90.1 first required DCV in densely occupied spaces of 0.40 people/m2 or more in 1999 and reduced the required threshold to 0.25 people/m2 in 2013 [2]. With DCV, mechanical ventilation rates can be reduced during periods of decreased occupancy and when CO2 levels are reduced by natural ventilation (i.e., with open windows) and infiltration. When at least one occupant is present, DCV systems may not reduce ventilation below the value required to remove contaminants that are not occupancy dependent (e.g., volatile organic compounds released from building materials and interior furnishings), which is a calculation based on floor area [5]. When occupants are present and the ventilation required exceeds the floor area requirement, DCV systems are designed to control the indoor CO2 concentration to a maximum level to provide the desired per-person ventilation rate. The maximum indoor CO2 concentration setpoint may vary based on jurisdiction and building operator. For reference, California\u2019s Building Energy Efficiency Standards specify a DCV setpoint of 600 ppm above outdoor level while a range of international building standards specify maximum concentrations of 350 to 1350 ppm above outdoors depending on indoor air quality category [2,6]. CO2 emissions from people (which vary by age, sex, and activity level) are a good indicator of respiratory aerosol generation and control strategies to manage CO2 concentrations help assure adequate ventilation and are one way to reduce exposure to infectious aerosols and respiratory illness transmission risk [7,8]. It is important to assess the CO2-control performance of DCV systems given the occupant health implications. Acker et al. (2021) examined six DCV systems in the field (two commercial offices, two medical offices, and two schools) and found none to be functioning properly for one or more of the following reasons: lack of specification of control parameters, lack of sensor communication, poor sensor placement, and supply fan not operating continuously [9]. In a study of packaged HVAC systems with DCV controllers from two manufacturers installed in two California classrooms each, Pistochini et al. (2019) observed that CO2 concentrations in the classrooms were not well controlled and had greater variation than expected, even after ensuring none of the problems identified by Acker were present [10]. Furthermore, the DCV controllers did not allow for technician programming or adjustments that would improve their performance. Preliminary testing of one DCV controller in the laboratory by Fraiser et al. (2021) demonstrated that its control algorithm achieved CO2 control within 75 ppm of the setpoint only 66\u201373 % of the time for six different occupancy functions as a result of initial overshoot of the CO2 setpoint (attributed to under-ventilation) followed by steady-state period of lowered CO2 attributed to over-ventilation [11]. While more sophisticated building management systems may accommodate custom programming and specification of control parameters, these systems currently require an experienced engineer to tune the system in an occupied building [12]. Proportional-integral (PI) control is a type of feedback control that determines the control input based on the current error from the setpoint and the integral of the error over time. Proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control is similar and also considers the derivative of the error. Shell et. al. (1998) describes that PI control is applied to DCV [13], but no sources were found that describe the relationship between proportional gain, integral gain, and controller performance as a function of building occupancy density and patterns. Johnson Controls employs a patented adaptive control algorithm for automatically adjusting the gains in PI control and has published field data demonstrating good performance for controlling supply air temperature and fan speed in an air handler, however results for DCV were not included [14]. It is currently unclear how most commercially available packaged DCV controllers function as they are \u201cblack boxes\u201d with proprietary control algorithms. There is a lack of performance data in terms of how successful a particular DCV controller will be in maintaining the programmed CO2 setpoint and quantification of actuator movements required to achieve the result. Lu et al. (2022) reviewed approaches for CO2-based DCV and categorized them as rule-based, model-based, and learning-based, where rule-based controls (which include PI control) are noted to result in potential air quality problems [15]. Due to the capacitance of the building air volume, CO2 levels take minutes to increase, while the time required to change an outdoor air damper position to respond to the CO2 signal is on the order of seconds. Therefore, it is expected that well-designed feedback controllers would be sufficient for the job. However, as described by Lu et al. (2022), there is increasing research into more sophisticated DCV approaches including model-based control and learning-based control. Several of the included studies compared results of new control methods to PI/PID control. Lu et al. (2013) compared an open-loop control method (called Psuedo Session DCV) that predicted occupancy based on CO2 concentrations and concluded that performance was similar to PI control, with both managing CO2 to within 10 ppm of the setpoint. Liu et al. (2014) developed and simulated a model predictive controller for temperature and CO2 control and concluded the performance was improved compared to the PI controller, which overshot the CO2 setpoint by 600 ppm and took hours to return to the setpoint [16]. Zhigang et al. (2010) developed a feedback linearization strategy and presented simulation results demonstrating that the proposed controller achieved better CO2 control (within 10 ppm of setpoint) than a PID controller (within 50 ppm of setpoint) [17], although the improvement was small (less than 5 % of the setpoint). Lachhab et al. (2019) showed that a state-feedback controller, formulated based on a linearized single-zone ventilation system, achieved slightly better CO2 control performance than a PID controller, although both approaches overshot the CO2 setpoint by 100\u2013150 ppm [18]. Finally, Zhu et al. (2014) showed that a reinforcement learning controller achieved better CO2 control (within 15 ppm of setpoint) than the PI controller (within 30 ppm of setpoint), but these differences were small and unlikely to be meaningful in the field [19]. It is unclear why Zhigang et al. (2010), Lu et al. (2013) and Zhu et al. (2014) achieved much better results with PI/PID controllers compared to Liu et al. (2014) and Lachhab et al. (2019) as the papers do not describe the gains used for PI/PID control. Finally, all studies except Lachhab et al. (2019) were simulations only, so it is unclear how well the simulations represent the dynamics of physical systems. For studies that achieve good results with PI control, the main improvement cited from more sophisticated approaches was eliminating the need for building-specific tuning. In general, it is difficult to assess the potential benefits of a proposed new control method when the performance of the simulated baseline PI/PID control varied widely. A method of test for DCV controllers is important to benchmark commercially available controllers, motivate industry improvements, and provide a direct comparison for new control approaches. The specifics of DCV control vary with design of the air handling unit (AHU). The most straightforward application of DCV is to a single-zone constant air volume (CAV) AHU, where the air handler fan runs at a fixed speed and the supply air serves a single space with one CO2 sensor. This is commonly found in wall-mount and packaged rooftop HVAC systems that are prevalent in light commercial buildings and schools [20]. These systems often contain a local controller for the outdoor and return air damper assembly that has DCV capabilities. These local controllers are often referred to as \u201ceconomizer controllers\u201d because they can increase outdoor airflow to 100 % of the supply airflow for \u201cfree\u201d cooling when the building requires cooling and outdoor air conditions meet certain criteria. The method of test and subsequent evaluation of DCV controllers presented here is limited to local controllers for single-zone CAV AHU systems; the term DCV controller used hereafter refers to this limited subset of DCV controllers. This paper presents a method of test to assess the performance of single-zone CAV DCV controllers that receive a CO2 sensor input and modulate the outdoor and return air dampers for an HVAC system to maintain an indoor CO2 setpoint. Each controller tested was challenged with three CO2 generation profiles that represent three different occupancy densities and two building occupancy schedules. The system performance (in terms of CO2 concentration and total damper movement) was compared to the performance of an ideal feed-forward controller, which determines the required ventilation rate to achieve the desired CO2 concentration based on the CO2 generation function. Six commercially available controllers were tested to demonstrate the method and benchmark the state-of-the-art. Finally, a model of a PI controller for a single-zone CAV system was developed and simulated to evaluate the impact of proportional and integral gain selection on controller performance for the same series of CO2 generation functions. The model was validated with the laboratory method of test and the performance achievable with fixed gain (i.e. not tuned, non-adaptive) PI control was evaluated and quantified. 2 CO2-based demand control ventilation method of test 2.1 Chamber design and construction A test chamber constructed from a walk-in freezer case (with no refrigeration system) was built to represent a scaled room with a constant volume air handling unit (AHU) plus a CO2 distribution system to mimic CO2 exhaled by building occupants (Fig. 1 ). The chamber had an interior height of 2.4 m and a floor area of 5.2 m2. The AHU mixed the return air from the chamber with outdoor air and supplied the mixed air to the chamber. The fraction of outdoor air to return air was controlled by the voltage to the outdoor air damper actuator (Belimo TFB24-SR) (fully open at 10 V, closed at 2 V) and return air damper actuator (Belimo TFB24-SR) (fully open at 2 V, closed at 10 V). The control voltage was output from the DCV controller under test. The mixed air was supplied to the chamber at a constant flow rate using a multi-speed supply fan (AC Infinity Cloudline T6) set to the desired flowrate. Additionally, a supply air damper actuator (Belimo TFB24-SR) controlled by a PI controller was used to fine-tune the supply airflow rate to the setpoint based on differential pressure (TEC DG-700) across a custom orifice plate calibrated using tracer gas measurement techniques. The outdoor air rate was measured based on the differential pressure (TEC DG-700) across a second custom orifice plate, calibrated using tracer gas measurement techniques. Uncertainty of the supply and outdoor air rates measured with the tracer gas system was estimated at less than 3 % of the measurement using an error propagation method [21]. A pressure relief damper was used to exhaust air from the chamber to maintain a differential pressure in the chamber of 1\u201310 Pa above the surrounding environment. Within the chamber, a wall-mounted high accuracy, calibrated HVAC-grade CO2 sensor (Vaisala GMP251) was installed on the wall four feet from the floor to measure the chamber CO2 concentration. The outdoor air and exhaust air CO2 concentrations were monitored with Vaisala GMP251 and GMW90 sensors, respectively. A ceiling fan operated clockwise at high-speed mixed the chamber air during the test. A wall-mounted mini-split heat pump (Pansaonic RX09RMVJU9/FTXR09TVJUW) with thermostat was used to condition the chamber air to meet the test conditions (Table 2 ). The chamber air temperature and humidity were continuously monitored (Vaisala HMP110). When compatible, the chamber CO2 sensor was used in all tests to send the CO2 signal to the DCV controller. The goal of using a calibrated CO2 sensor was to isolate testing of the DCV controller response characteristics. If the DCV controller\u2019s manufacturer's CO2 sensor had to be used with the controller due to compatibility requirements, then all manufacturer recommendations for the operation of the CO2 sensor were followed. In this case, the chamber CO2 sensor was still used to record the CO2 concentration during the tests for consistency. Of six controllers tested (Table 3 ), only the Pelican Wireless system required use of the manufacturer\u2019s CO2 sensor. In this case, the accuracy of the manufacturer\u2019s CO2 sensor was evaluated using a calibration test protocol [11]. Accuracy for the manufacturer\u2019s CO2 sensor was within 5 % of the sensor reading. CO2 from a compressed gas cylinder was regulated to 30 psi and plumbed to a mass flow controller (Alicat MC-1slpm-D/5M). The supply from the mass flow controller was plumbed to the chamber, where a manifold split the flow into nine small tubes which were attached to nine ends of a distribution frame 1.2 m above the floor to simulate the height of seated occupants. The nine distribution points were arranged in a three-by-three rectangular pattern such that the distance between the chamber walls and each distribution point was the same. Each distribution tube had an identical length for equal flow resistance. The mass flow controller injected the CO2 following a time-based occupancy density function for each test (Fig. 3). Data acquisition of the chamber CO2, temperature, and humidity sensors, control command and position feedback of the three damper actuators, and CO2 generation rate was performed with a NI Compact DAQ Chassis (NI cDAQ-9174) and serial data communication interface and LabVIEW software (NI LabVIEW 2019 SP1). Data was acquired at 10 Hz, averaged, and logged at 0.1 Hz. 2.2 Test conditions and configuration DCV controllers need to adjust ventilation in response to changing occupancy. To represent occupancy patterns encountered in typical buildings, a step occupancy schedule and gradual occupancy schedule were developed (Fig. 2 ). The step occupancy function was intended to reflect use cases where occupants enter and exit a space in groups (e.g., classroom and conference room) and the gradual occupancy pattern is intended to reflect use cases where occupancy gradually builds in a space with a peak occupancy period (e.g., restaurant and grocery store). Testing DCV controllers in response to a step change and gradual change is expected to cover the range of operating conditions, since building occupancy schedules are a combination of step and gradual changes. For each occupancy schedule (step and gradual), three occupancy densities (low, medium, and high) were considered to cover a range of ventilation rates from ASHRAE Standard 62.1\u20132019 [22] (Table 1). To set the maximum (100 %) CO2 generation rate for the laboratory test, the occupancy density was scaled by the floor area of the chamber (5.2 m2) and multiplied by an average CO2 generation rate of 4.72 mL/s-person (Table 1). CO2 generation rates per person vary widely from 3.6 to 9.1 mL/s based on age, body mass, sex, and level of physical activity, where 4.72 mL/s is representative of seated occupants [23]. Three different maximum CO2 generation rates were calculated based on the assumption of varying occupancy density. However, the range could also reflect variance in occupant CO2 generation rate for the same occupancy density. Each occupancy schedule type (step and gradual) was then multiplied by the maximum CO2 generation rate to obtain six CO2 generation schedules (Fig. 3 ). When a DCV system is implemented, building codes require that a minimum ventilation rate be supplied to the building during typical occupancy hours (even when no occupants are present) to remove indoor pollutants that are emitted from building materials and furnishings. The minimum ventilation is a function of floor area and for this test procedure was set to 0.76 L/s-m2 (4.0 L/s for the chamber used), which is the standard in California [24], and is within the range of requirements set by ASHRAE Standard 62.1\u20132019 [22]. Finally, the total supply airflow rate of the AHU, which is the sum of the return air and the outdoor air, was set to a constant of 5.1 L/s-m2 (26.4 L/s for the chamber used), which is a typical supply airflow rate used in constant air volume systems to meet heating and cooling loads in commercial buildings [25]. This test method can be executed with any chamber size by sizing the mechanical components and scaling the CO2 generation rate, minimum ventilation rate, and supply airflow rate accordingly. Prior to testing a DCV controller, the supply fan and PI-controlled supply air damper were configured to provide the required airflow of 26.4 L/s using the AHU controls described in Section 2.1. The minimum outdoor and return air damper position were set in the controller under test to be 4.2 V, which provided a 4 L/s ventilation rate based on the calibration described in Section 2.1. The maximum outdoor and return air damper position were set to 10 V to allow up to 100 % outdoor air. To ensure that each DCV controller test was consistent and repeatable, a set of test conditions and tolerances were developed that cover the important environmental parameters and the accuracy of the instruments used to measure these parameters is reported (Table 2). Within Table 2, the test operating tolerance specifies the allowed difference from the test condition at each 10 s time step. The test condition tolerance specifies the allowed difference from the test condition for the measured parameter averaged over the entire test. Atmospheric pressure is included since changes in atmospheric pressure affect air density. The test laboratory was near sea level (16 m) and all tests were conducted at ambient pressure. The difference in the indoor and exhaust CO2 concentrations was used as a metric to monitor the uniformity of the chamber CO2 concentration during the test. Since completely uniform CO2 concentrations are not achievable in practice, an operating tolerance of 50 ppm was set on the absolute value of the five-minute moving-average difference of the indoor and exhaust CO2 concentration. The moving-average was applied to smooth out sensor noise from the difference calculation. All test data was post-processed to ensure that tolerances were met and any test that failed was repeated. 2.3 Test protocol For each evaluation, the DCV controller was installed and connected to the chamber CO2 sensor (unless a specific manufacturer\u2019s CO2 sensor was required) and the control output was connected to outdoor and return air damper actuators. The DCV controller was programmed with a chamber CO2 concentration setpoint of 600 ppm above the outdoor air consistent with the specification in California\u2019s Building Energy Efficiency Standards. The DCV controller was programmed for an actuator voltage range of 2 to 10 V with a minimum setting of 4.2 V. Once the preliminary setup tasks were complete, the six tests were executed with the CO2 generation profiles shown in Fig. 3. Upon completion of a test, the chamber was flushed with outdoor air to return the indoor CO2 concentration below 425 ppm to begin the next test. The automated process was repeated until the tests for all six profiles were complete and all test conditions were met. 2.4 Ideal DCV controller To quantify the performance of each DCV controller, the time-series chamber CO2 concentration for each test was compared to the expected concentration under an ideal DCV controller. The ideal DCV controller is a theoretical feedforward controller with inputs of outdoor CO2 concentration, CO2 generation rate, initial chamber CO2 concentration, and chamber CO2 concentration setpoint. Comparing the results obtained from the DCV controller laboratory test method with that obtained from the closed-loop simulation under the ideal DCV strategy gives a measure of how close the DCV controller performance is relative to the optimal performance, where optimal performance is the minimum amount of ventilation required to maintain the CO2 concentration at or below the setpoint. Assuming that the chamber CO2 concentration is spatially uniform such that it can be characterized by a single value, an overall mass balance of CO2 in the chamber yields a box model: (1) dm C O 2 , B o x ( t ) dt = m ̇ C O 2 , O A t - m ̇ C O 2 , B o x t + G ̇ m , C O 2 ( t ) where m C O 2 , B o x is the total mass of CO2 in the chamber, m ̇ C O 2 , O A is the mass flow rate of CO2 in the outdoor air stream, m ̇ C O 2 , B o x is the mass flow rate of CO2 in the chamber exhaust air stream, and G ̇ m , C O 2 is the mass generation rate of CO2 in the chamber. Under the assumptions that the air density is constant and the outdoor airflow rate into the chamber is equal to the airflow rate leaving the chamber through the exhaust relief damper, Equation (1) simplifies to (2) V Box dC C O 2 , B o x ( t ) dt = V ̇ OA t C C O 2 , O A t - C C O 2 , B o x t / 10 6 + G ̇ v , C O 2 ( t ) where V Box is the total volume of the chamber, C C O 2 , B o x is the chamber CO2 concentration, V ̇ OA is outdoor airflow rate, C C O 2 , O A is the outdoor air CO2 concentration, and G ̇ v , C O 2 is the volumetric generation rate of CO2 in the chamber. Concentrations are expressed in terms of ppm and division by 106 converts the concentration to a unitless ratio of carbon dioxide to total air volume, so that the units of each term in Equation (2) are the change of the volume of CO2 in the chamber in liters per second. The ideal DCV controller was modeled as a feedforward controller, which utilizes perfect information of the CO2 generation rate in the chamber to compute a ventilation rate that exactly rejects the effect of the disturbance. On the contrary, DCV controllers are feedback controllers (i.e., reactive instead of proactive) since measuring the generation rate is not practical. The ideal DCV strategy is to maintain the minimum ventilation rate if the expected CO2 concentration is at or below the CO2 setpoint. Otherwise, the ideal controller selects the ventilation rate that exactly maintains the CO2 concentration at its setpoint. Determining the ventilation rate that maintains the chamber concentration at exactly its setpoint requires the solution of Equation (2). A simultaneous solution strategy was employed to determine the ventilation rate for the ideal DCV controller and the solution of Equation (2). Provided the input data including the chamber air volume, the outdoor air CO2 concentration profile, the CO2 generation rate profile, and an initial chamber CO2 concentration, Equation (2) may be numerically solved. For a fair comparison between the ideal DCV controller and each DCV controller tested, the outdoor air CO2 concentration profile ( C C O 2 , O A t ) and initial chamber concentration ( C C O 2 , B o x t = 0 ) were taken to be equal to the recorded data from each DCV controller test. The explicit Euler method was employed to solve Equation (2) with a time step ( Δ t ) of 10 s, which gives: (3) C C O 2 , B o x t + Δ t = C C O 2 , B o x t + Δ t V Box V ̇ OA t ∗ C C O 2 , O A t - C C O 2 , B o x t / 10 6 + G ̇ v , C O 2 t When C C 02 , B o x t + Δ t was less than the setpoint ( C C 02 , B o x , S e t ), V ̇ OA t was set to the minimum ventilation rate. Otherwise, the ventilation rate that kept C C 02 , B o x t + Δ t at the setpoint was computed from: (4) V ̇ OA t = V Box ∗ C C 02 , B o x , S e t - C C O 2 , B o x t / 10 6 - Δ t ∗ G ̇ v , C O 2 t Δ t ∗ C C O 2 , O A t - C C O 2 , B o x t / 10 6 While the outdoor CO2 concentration and the initial chamber concentration will minimally affect the ideal controller computations, an example result for the medium density step function where the initial chamber and outdoor CO2 concentrations were set to 400 ppm is shown for illustrative purposes (Fig. 4 ). The ventilation rate begins at the minimum (4 L/s). When the CO2 injection begins at t = 0.5 hr the ventilation rate remains at the minimum until the CO2 level reaches the setpoint. The ventilation rate then adjusts to 15 L/s to maintain the CO2 concentration setpoint. When the CO2 injection stops (t = 2 hr), the ventilation rate returns to the minimum and the CO2 begins to decay. Finally, the damper position that would achieve the ideal ventilation rate was calculated from a series of measurements correlating the damper position and the outdoor airflow rate measured with the calibrated orifice plate (Fig. 5 ). This linearized relationship was used to calculate the damper position for the ideal controller: (5) D OA t = a ∗ V ̇ OA t + b where D OA t is the damper position in volts for the AHU used to implement the test protocol and a and b are experimentally measured for the AHU. The commercially available controllers were tested in 2021 and the developed PI controller (Section 4) was tested in 2022; the AHU was altered to add a filter assembly in between these tests so the coefficients for Equation (5) were measured twice (Fig. 5). The total damper movement over the test was found by summing the absolute value of the change in damper position over all time steps, where n is the length of the test. (6) D OA , t o t a l = ∑ t = 0 n D OA t + Δ t - D OA t Since the ideal controller result was calculated for each test with the actual outdoor air CO2 concentration, the result for the total ideal damper travel may vary depending on the outdoor CO2 concentration seen over the course of the test. 2.5 Control performance evaluation For each controller, all six tests were analyzed to determine how closely the actual chamber CO2 concentration matched the ideal chamber CO2 concentration. For each time step, the actual CO2 concentration was compared to the ideal chamber CO2 concentration and binned into one of three categories: 1. Target ventilation rate \u2013 actual chamber CO2 concentration within 75 ppm of ideal 2. Over-ventilated \u2013 actual chamber CO2 concentration less than 75 ppm of ideal 3. Under-ventilated \u2013 actual chamber CO2 concentration more than 75 ppm of ideal The accuracy of the controller in tracking the CO2 setpoint over time was used as the performance metric because CO2 concentration is the control variable. A shortcoming of using CO2 concentration as the control variable is that it only an indicator of ventilation rate [26]. The actual ventilation rate can only be calculated from CO2 concentration when all other variables are known (change in CO2 concentration over time, CO2 generation rates, and space volume). Therefore, tracking deviation greater than 75 ppm from the CO2 setpoint is used as an indicator of the ventilation performance. At steady state conditions for the CO2 generation rates used in this test procedure, a difference of less than 75 ppm from the CO2 setpoint equates to being with 15 % of the target ventilation rate. The number of time steps in groups (1) to (3) was converted to a percentage of the total time steps. The total movement of the outdoor air damper was also considered in evaluating the control performance. The total damper movement was summed for the controller tested (Equation (6) the ratio of the total damper travel to the ideal controller travel was calculated. 3 Commercially available controllers tested Six commercially available packaged system DCV controllers were evaluated with the test protocol and analyzed in comparison to the ideal controller (Table 1). In all cases, the exact algorithm pre-programmed into the controller was unknown, although in some cases the general method was described by the manufacturer (Table 1). None of the controllers tested allowed for manual tuning; the only setting available in all cases was a CO2 setpoint or activation level. Additionally, the Honeywell Jade had a \u201cslow\u201d or \u201cfast\u201d damper setting that was accessible with a external configuration tool; both settings were tested. In all cases, the controller was set to have a minimum damper position of 4.2 V (minimum flow rate of 4 L/s) and a maximum damper position of 10 V. In most cases, the control logic was stored on the device as firmware, except for the Pelican Pearl, which maintained the control logic in the cloud (See Section 6 for discussion for comparison of device firmware versus cloud-based computing). Review of manufacturer documentation and discussion with a few of the manufacturers revealed different operating control principles. For example, when the CO2 concentration is over the setpoint, the Honeywell Jade opens the damper until the setpoint is met. When the CO2 level drops below the setpoint minus the dead band (typically 100 ppm), the damper closes back to minimum. Manuals for the Johnson Control devices describe a PI-controller with a patented adaptative tuning method. The Pelican Pearl uses a response curve function where the CO2 setting is the concentration at which the damper starts to open past the minimum setting. The manufacturer recommends using the default setting of 800 ppm as the activation CO2 concentration; both 800 and 1000 ppm were tested as activation levels. Pelican also has a setpoint-based feedback control method under development that was tested; the details of the operating mechanism were unknown. The control method for the XC Spec and Belimo Zip were unknown. 4 PI controller 4.1 PI controller development A PI controller was modeled and tested to optimize selection of the proportional gain (Kp) and integral gain (Ki) tuning parameters for best controller performance across the range of occupancy patterns and densities in Fig. 3. A PI controller with proportional gain (Kp) and integral gain ( τ i ) tuning parameters that achieves good performance across a variety of building types without need for a proprietary and/or patented algorithms would be a useful tool for building operators and engineers. First, a base PI algorithm along with a box model of the chamber was programmed in software to simulate the total system. The PI algorithm used the current error between the measurement and the setpoint ( C C 02 , B o x , S e t ), the timestep ( Δ t ), and the proportional ( K p ) and integral gains ( τ i ) to calculate the outdoor air rate V ̇ OA ( t ) . The chamber box model (Equation (3) and the outdoor air CO2 concentration were then used to calculate the chamber CO2 concentration in the next time step. Two improvements were made to the base PI algorithm to improve ventilation control. First, the error of the difference between the setpoint and the chamber concentration (Equation (7) was calculated with respect to a dead band ( db ) (Equation (8). If the error was less the dead band ( db ), the error was set to zero. This prevented excessive damper movement. Second, anti-integral windup with back calculation was applied so that the outdoor air rate stayed within the bounds of the minimum and maximum for the physical system. This prevents windup during periods that the controller saturates (when the candidate ventilation rate V ̇ OA ∗ is outside the bounds of the maximum or minimum rate) (Equation (9) - Equation (11) [27]. Finally, the outdoor air rate V ̇ OA ( t ) was calculated with Equation (12). This extended PI algorithm was modeled with a 1 min timestep and gains were constrained to K p > 0 and τ i > 0 . Note that while the outdoor air rate and Kp are expressed in units of L/s and L/s.ppm-CO2, the control output (and associated Kp) can be damper position in instead of airflow rate by applying a conversion factor between damper position and airflow rate (using a linear approximation).

Pelican\u2019s application programming interface (API) was used to control the damper position setting for the PEARL; the proprietary control algorithms inside the PEARL described earlier were bypassed and not used for this test. The CO2 setpoint ( C C 02 , B o x , S e t ) was 1,000 ppm. Once a minute, the average value of the CO2 sensor (rounded to 1 ppm to represent typical CO2 sensor resolution) was passed to the PI algorithm which updated the outdoor air rate ( V ̇ OA ( t ) ). The outdoor air rate was converted to a damper position once per minute and sent to the PEARL controller over Pelican\u2019s application programming interface (API). Note that while a detailed correlation between damper position and outdoor air flow rate was available (Fig. 5), only the minimum and maximum damper positions and flow rates were used to calculate the conversion factor (0.26 V/(L/s)) to be representative of the typical data available in field installation. The time delay to update the damper position command through the web service was a few seconds. 5 Results 5.1 Commercially available controllers Results for the commercially available controllers (labeled C1 to C6) for the medium occupancy density step function are shown in Fig. 6 ; results for the other occupancy density functions are included in the Supplementary Information. For C1, Honeywell Jade, the control algorithm opens the damper at a fixed rate once the setpoint is exceeded. Result C1a has the damper speed set to \u201cslow\u201d and C1b has the damper speed set to \u201cfast\u201d. In both cases, the CO2 concentration overshoots the setpoint which is when the damper starts to open. Damper opening continues until the CO2 concentration drops to 100 ppm below the setpoint, which causes the damper to return to the minimum position, and the process repeats. The \u201cslow\u201d versus \u201cfast\u201d setting determines the frequency of this process. This control method results in continuous oscillations of the CO2 concentration and excessive movement of the damper. Controllers C2 and C3, two products from Johnson Controls International (JCI), appear to contain similar control algorithms since the results are similar (Fig. 6). In both cases, the CO2 concentration overshoots the setpoint by approximately 300 ppm before the damper begins to open. While the total damper movement was similar to the ideal controller, this delay in response results in poor CO2 control. Tests C4a and C4b, the Pelican Pearl, used the response curve method where the damper opened all the way at the upper CO2 concentration limit of 1600 ppm. In C4a it was programmed to start opening above the activation level at 1000 ppm and in C4b this value was reduced to 800 ppm. The strategy resulted in stable CO2 values that exceeded the setpoint by approximately 200 ppm (Fig. 6). While the total damper movement was similar to the ideal controller, the response curve approach generally resulted in a steady-state offset from the CO2 setpoint. In the tests with low occupancy density (Figure S 1 and Figure S 3), the settings in C4a achieved an excellent result; the increase in CO2 deviation from the setpoint increased as the simulated occupancy density increased. Since Pelican operates over a cloud-based platform, it is possible for operators to adjust settings remotely based on CO2 monitoring results, a feature that was not available for any of the other controllers tested. At our request, Pelican enabled a demonstration version of a feedback algorithm (C4c). The performance was similar to that observed with the JCI algorithm. Controller C5 is the XC Spec Air Quality Display for which the details of the algorithm were unavailable. The results suggest a response curve strategy based on the steady-state offsets from the setpoint observed (Fig. 6). However, the XC Spec settings (which we did not have access to) appear to be more aggressive such that the observed CO2 concentrations were much lower than the setpoint, except in the case of the high occupancy density tests where the steady-state CO2 concentration was within 100 ppm of the setpoint (Figure S 2 and Figure S 5). In all tests the damper moved constantly with small movements, resulting in the greatest total movement among controllers tested. Controller 6, the Belimo Zip that uses a PI algorithm, had the best performance among all controllers tested (Fig. 6). This controller had a small overshoot of less than 150 ppm at the beginning of each period of CO2 generation but had otherwise excellent performance. Controller C-PI in Fig. 6 is the test result for the PI controller developed by the research team; results are described further in Section 5.2. The performance metrics for each controller averaged over all six tests are summarized in Fig. 8. The stacked bars show the percent of time that the controller was under (red), over (yellow), or at (green) the target ventilation rate. The single bar shows the ratio of the actual damper travel compared to the ideal. While performance varied between controllers and between tests, on average the commercially available controllers demonstrated poor control of CO2 and two controllers had damper movement more than three times that required by an ideal controller. The best performing Belimo Zip achieved good CO2 control ∼80 % of the time with damper movement slightly less than the ideal controller. Note that it\u2019s possible for the damper ratio value to be less than 1 if the controller reduces damper movement in exchange for reduced control of CO2. 5.2 Test conditions and repeatability We observed that tests often failed the criterion that required the absolute value of the five-minute moving-average difference of the indoor and exhaust CO2 concentration to be less than 50 ppm (Table 2). An example of four repeat tests is shown for Controller 2 for the high density step function (Fig. 7 ). The high density step function is shown because it has the highest CO2 generation and outdoor airflow rates, which resulted in the greatest differences in the indoor and exhaust CO2 concentrations. Although the test had to be run four times to achieve a passing result, the failed results (in terms of indoor CO2 concentration and damper movement) are nearly identical to the passing result. This suggests the constraint on this criterion could be relaxed, perhaps to 75 ppm, to reduce the number of repeat tests. The repeat tests for Controller 2 are shown since JCI reports that the device contains a pattern recognition adaptive control algorithm to adjust gains [13]. As seen in Fig. 7, there was no observed change in the response over the course of the testing and no evidence of impacts from the adaptive algorithm. The current test protocol would need to be modified to include longer testing sequences for controllers that demonstrate adaptive behavior, however, the need did not arise for the sample of controllers that was tested here. 5.3 PI controller The model of the PI controller described in Section 4.1 was initially simulated and laboratory tested for all six tests with K p = 0.076 L/s.ppm-CO2 (equating to 20 mV/ppm-CO2 for the OA damper) and τ i = 8 min. Both the controller performance and the simulation agreement with the laboratory test data were excellent (Fig. 6 and Figure S 1 - Figure S 5, C-PI). The PI controller achieved within 75 ppm of the CO2 setpoint an average 92 % of the time across all six tests while the remaining 8 % time was in the overventilated region. The modeled performance (99 % of time within 75 ppm) was better than the actual performance, likely due to small differences in the physical and modeled AHU and the modeled assumption of uniform CO2 concentration in the chamber. The PI controller achieved this performance with a damper travel ratio of 1.5. It is notable that a PI algorithm configured with only a minimum and maximum damper position and without tuning exceeded the CO2 control performance of the six commercially available controllers that were tested. While a complete set of laboratory tests takes approximately a week to run, the simulation can be run in seconds and thus provides for a rapid pathway by which different control strategies and settings can be assessed. With the model validated by the laboratory test data, the PI controller was simulated for a range of proportional ( K p ) and integral ( τ i ) gains to determine the best settings for the PI algorithm applied to all six CO2 generation profiles; the results across all six tests were averaged in Fig. 9 . Integral gains of 2 to 16 min all resulted in CO2 concentration within the 75 ppm target more than 95 % of the time. However, the proportional gain must be sufficiently low (20\u2013100 mV/ppm) to avoid damper oscillations and excessive movement. Since outdoor airflow rates generally scale with floor area, the model was re-run with double the ceiling height (with all other inputs the same) to understand the impact of increasing the room air volume for the same floor area. In this case, the additional capacitance of the room air delayed outdoor air damper opening. However, once the CO2 setpoint was reached, the steady-state outdoor air requirement was the same and the controller performance was similar. The doubled room air capacitance doubled the proportional gain value at which damper oscillations initiated. 6 Discussion and conclusions Six commercial DCV controllers tested under a range of typical occupancy patterns and densities generally had poor to marginal performance for CO2 control. The best performing controller (Belimo Zip) achieved target CO2 control 80 % of the time with damper movement slightly less than an ideal controller. Two controllers had damper movement more than three times required by the ideal controller. Notably, a PI algorithm we applied and configured with minimum and maximum damper position and preset, non-adaptable gains, achieved superior performance with target CO2 control 92 % of the time. The PI algorithm achieved excellent CO2 control performance under a wide range of simulated occupancy patterns and densities without tuning specific to the CO2 generation profile or building volume (i.e. building-specific tuning). This indicates that more complicated DCV control approaches (model-based and learning-based) summarized by Lu et al. (2022) are unnecessary for the range of DCV use cases evaluated in this study [15]. An important limitation of this study is the focus on single-zone constant volume DCV controllers, which is the most straightforward application of DCV, as multi-zone and variable air volume systems require additional control sequences to consider CO2 sensors in each zone, mixing between zones, and variable supply airflow rates [28,29,30]. The test methodology presented here could be expanded to evaluate multi-zone and/or variable air volume DCV controllers. The results from the study clearly demonstrate that the control algorithms pre-programmed into single-zone DCV controllers are a substantial contributor to poor CO2 control. While the goal of this study was to isolate the deviation from the CO2 setpoint that was attributable to the control algorithm, it is important to consider that the CO2 concentration in a space controlled by a DCV system may also be affected by errors in CO2 sensor accuracy and placement as well as configuration and installation errors [9,15]. Improving DCV control algorithms for single-zone CAV HVAC systems will have positive impacts in improving control of outdoor air dampers and resulting CO2 concentrations. This is expected to reduce the transmission of airborne infectious diseases, optimize HVAC energy use, and reduce damper actuator failures. Manufacturers can improve their control algorithms using the PI control approach demonstrated here, or with alternate approaches, so long as they are laboratory tested and demonstrate good CO2 tracking and damper movement performance. This research is the first to demonstrate the importance of testing DCV controllers and to propose a test method, which is straightforward and can be executed by a laboratory with an environmental chamber modified to the test protocol with a scaled AHU. Although execution of all six tests provides the most information, controller problems are most evident when tested with the step function. Without an accepted test procedure and subsequent codified performance requirements and/or demand from building owners and operators, manufacturers are unlikely to be motivated to improve their products. Unfortunately, even if manufacturers develop and deploy improved algorithms, change is likely to be slow given that HVAC systems are infrequently replaced. Possibilities to achieve scalable improvements on a faster timescale are either updating firmware on existing controllers or replacing controllers. Either option requires a technician to access each packaged system to complete this work, increasing the cost of the upgrade. The exception is cloud-based control systems where the control logic either exists on the cloud and/or can be updated remotely to a local device with an edge computing strategy [31]. An additional benefit of cloud-based systems is the ability to track system performance and detect faults. Potential draw backs are maintenance fees for device communication and data storage, cybersecurity and privacy concerns, and performance impacts from connectivity losses (which may be mitigated with edge computing that integrates local devices with cloud computing). Regardless of the method for which DCV control is implemented, this work clearly demonstrates the need to improve embedded control algorithms and deploy those improvements across the industry.

Packaged heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning systems often contain DCV controllers with embedded proprietary algorithms that lack transparent performance data. A test method was developed to assess the ability of a DCV controller to maintain the indoor CO2 concentration at a setpoint in response to a series of CO2 generation functions that represent three different building occupancy densities and two occupancy schedules. Six commercially available controllers were tested to demonstrate the method and provide directly comparable results. The performance (in terms of CO2 control and damper movement) of each controller tested was compared to the performance of an ideal controller which knows the CO2 generation function. Finally, the performance of a proportional-integral (PI) controller with preset gains was developed and tested to determine the potential maximum performance achievable with this control strategy. The best performing commercially available controller achieved CO2 control (within 75 ppm of the setpoint) approximately 80 % of the time with damper movement slightly less than an ideal controller. However, most of the commercially available controllers had marginal or poor performance for CO2 control and damper movement. Two controllers had damper movement more than three times the ideal controller. Notably, a PI algorithm configured and tested by the research team achieved superior performance with CO2 control 92 % of the time and damper movement 1.5 times the ideal controller.",
