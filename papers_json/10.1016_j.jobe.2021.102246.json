Suzhou University of Science and Technology No. 99 XueFu Road Suzhou 215009 China Heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems contribute to a major portion of energy consumption in buildings. Real-time optimal control is an efficient tool to improve the HVAC system efficiency. The formulation of the optimal control strategy is, however, challenging due to the lack of quantitative approaches and unified control format. Many previous studies use domain knowledge or experts\u2019 interpretations to develop the optimal control strategy, which is qualitative, time-consuming and labor-intensive. This study proposes a data-mining-powered event-driven optimal control (EDOC) for improving HVAC operation efficiency. The main contributions are: (1) Provide a standard EDOC format to represent HVAC optimal control strategy; (2) Enable the automatic and quantitative formulation of optimal control strategies with minimal expert involvement. The random forest algorithm is adopted to discover event-driven relationships in the operation data. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through simulations. On average, the formulated EDOC strategy increases the energy saving by 0.9%\u20134.6% compared with a traditional time-driven optimal control. Meanwhile, events can be customized and can adapt to system renovations. The formulated EDOC is easy to use and can be easily understood by engineers and operators, which can be used to guide the optimal control of building HVAC systems.

Retro commissioning of existing building HVAC systems discovered the deficiency problems are mainly caused by control and operation [6\u20139]. It is thus critical to enhance the building HVAC control and operation for energy saving. The real-time optimal control is an effective tool for improving the operation efficiency by revising the operation settings or modes in adaption to the ever-changing operational changes. In the case of an existing building HVAC system, identifying the energy saving opportunities and providing the energy saving measures are the essentials for retrofitting the HVAC operating efficiency. However, identifying and formulating optimal control measures to improve the energy efficiency is not easy, which typically requires detailed energy audit involving extensive expertise and manual analyses. In real applications, the manual analysis is inefficient, especially in the era that many industries began to embrace the \u201cbig data\u201d technologies. The manual analyses would not only miss important information, but may also consumes an increasing amount of time as the data size keeps growing, which in turn limits the proliferation of retrofitting the building HVAC optimal control strategies. With the growing amount of building operation data and the rapid development of data mining (DM) techniques, mining the building operation data can provide deeper understanding on the building HVAC operation [10], leading to more energy saving opportunities. Moreover, DM can provide rapid processing of data comparing with manual analyses. Currently, diverse patterns and hidden knowledge could be discovered using DM [11\u201313]. However, the DM-discovered knowledge still requires extensive analyses from experts to interpret and manually formulate the implementable optimal control strategy. This is also termed as \u201cknowledge transformation\u201d referring to transferring knowledge into implementable strategies for performance enhancement, which was pointed out as a critical issue to be solved in the DM of building operation data [11]. The fundamental reason behind is that the building control strategy lacks a clear format [14]. Although the ASHRAE Guideline 13\u20132007 [15] provides some references, there is no explicit and clear format to represent the building control strategy, which in turn causes the mixed use of different styles in applications. In fact, since the format of control strategy is not unified, the DM lacks a clear objective to guide its DM process. This is also the reason that makes interpretability of DM results \u201cpoor\u201d in terms of HVAC optimal control [11]. As a result, the DM results were difficult to be directly used in the HVAC optimal control. Therefore, it is critical to firstly establish a unified format of optimal control strategy that can supervise the DM process. This study selected an event-driven optimal control (EDOC) strategy which is a recently proposed strategy aiming for energy-efficient optimal control of HVAC systems. The EDOC has a clear \u201cevent-policy-action\u201d format, where \u201cevent\u201d is used to describe the system state transitions in operation, e.g. water flow changes, temperature variations, etc. During the operation of HVAC systems, the EDOC reacts to the event such that the system can adapt to the critical system state transitions. Targeting for constructing the EDOC strategy, the DM process is configured to automatically identify and quantify critical state transitions. 1.2 HVAC optimal control A common form of the HVAC system optimal control problem is to minimize the operation energy consumption under constraints such as thermal comfort and indoor air quality [16]. After years of development, the engineering industry has established a two-layer control structure for real-time HVAC optimal control [17], in which the upper layer is the optimal (or supervisory) control level and the lower layer is the local control level (as shown in Fig. 1 ). The implementation process is as follows: based on the real-time operation data input into the Building management system (BMS), the optimal control is triggered; according to the mathematical model of the HVAC system, the energy consumption of relevant equipment in the system is predicted online; with the objective function, the optimal settings of decision variables that minimizes the system energy consumption are obtained by optimization algorithms (e.g. genetic algorithm [18]). Finally, the operations of chillers, pumps, and cooling towers will be manipulated based on the optimal settings. In literature, most of the HVAC optimal control uses the so-called \u201ctime-driven\u201d strategy which conducts control optimization (i.e. optimizing operation set-points or modes) based on a fixed time frequency [19]. For instance, Ma and Wang conducted HVAC optimal control for a supertall building in Hong Kong [20]. Wei et al. did optimal control for the Iowa Energy Center (Iowa, U.S.A.) [21]. Huang, Zuo and Sohn optimized the condenser water set-points of a legacy chiller plant located in Washington U.S.A [22]. Ling et al. optimized the HVAC system in a data center located in Dongjiang lake (Chenzhou, Hunan, China) [23]. These studies all used 1 h as the optimization frequency (i.e. 1 h per optimal control), and provided considerable energy saving compared with the constant operation settings (i.e. without control resetting). However, the time-driven optimal control (TDOC) strategy has two major disadvantages. (1) The fixed periodic optimization triggering strategy cannot respond to the random changes of operating conditions (e.g. weather or occupancy) promptly [19]. It would easily miss the best control opportunity or delay the optimal control. Thus, it is difficult to ensure an efficient operation of the HVAC system under dynamic operation conditions with the time-driven strategy [24]. (2) When the system operation condition is stable, the time-driven strategy will still trigger the unnecessary optimization, which not only brings external disturbance to the stable operation, but also accelerates the aging of the equipment [25]. This is not beneficial to the long-term stable operation of the HVAC system. More importantly, there is no quantitative relationship between the optimization goal (e.g. operation efficiency) and \u201ctime\u201d [26]. Only a simple qualitative rule exists: the higher the optimization frequency is, the higher the operation efficiency of the system is. However, a significantly high optimization frequency will affect the operation stability [17,27], while a low optimization frequency cannot warrant a satisfactory operation efficiency. In engineering applications, designers can only choose an optimization frequency based on experience and the worst-case situation, which is difficult to ensure the optimal control performance. To overcome the limitations of time-triggered strategy, event-driven strategy was proposed to cater for the random operation conditions of HVAC systems. Indeed, many complex industrial systems have successfully applied the event-driven strategy, e.g. power grids, wireless communication networks and remote surgery systems [28]. A typical event-driven strategy is designed such that control actions are only performed when a certain event (describes a condition) happens [25]. By doing so, EDOC can react to the random operation condition in the most efficient and prompt manner, i.e. improving the efficiency of operation and resource utilization. In building HVAC systems, events can be defined based on critical operation changes. Several studies were conducted to investigate the EDOC in building HVAC systems (see Table 1 ). To construct an EDOC strategy, the main task is to identify the event state variable and the event threshold. As shown in Table 1, the methods to identify the event state variable and event threshold are generally based on acknowledged domain knowledge, expertise (also a kind of knowledge), and simulation tests. However, these methods have several limitations. First, the knowledge is qualitative, based on which the quantitative parameters (e.g. event thresholds) are difficult to define. Besides, using building performance simulation is similar to the trial-and-error method. When the HVAC system becomes complex, the simulation will be time-consuming and difficult to be applied. Thus, although the EDOC strategy has been proven to be efficient in building HVAC optimal control, there is a lack of quantitative method for the identification of events including event state variables and event thresholds, which limit its applications. 1.3 Data mining in building Nowadays, big data and DM technologies show powerful application potential in various aspects. For instance, Tian et al. investigated the Bayesian Network approach in the HVAC design problem [33]; Mirnaghi and Haghighat reviewed the recent developments on data-driven DM for Fault detection and diagnosis in HVAC [34]; using DM methods in improving the HVAC operation were also studied in Refs. [35,36]. The DM in HVAC problems typically involves the prediction, clustering, classification, finding associations, identification of normal and abnormal operation, etc [37]. DM can learn the operation patterns of HVAC systems and establish the correlation relationships, e.g. the relationships between state variables and operation efficiency, which can guide the construction of optimal control strategy. Therefore, it is promising to use DM-based approach to construct the optimal control strategy of building HVAC systems. However, very few researches can be found regarding DM-based optimal control in building HVAC field. Table 2 reviews the recent researches related to DM-based HVAC optimal control. From Table 2, it can be found that most of the existing research lies in the level of discovering problems, e.g. identifying energy wastage phenomenon based on the operation data. Some suggestions were given to improve the existing optimal control strategy, but most suggestions are qualitative, which is not suitable for the instant use in HVAC optimal control. Expertise is still required to define quantitative parameters in the optimal control strategy. Very few works can be found in literature regarding the directly implementable the HVAC optimal control strategy developed with DM. Given a powerful capability of DM, it is of great interest and importance to explore an automatic DM process for constructing the quantitative HVAC optimal control strategy. 1.4 Summary To sum up, the EDOC strategy is promising to improve the performance of HVAC optimal control. Previous applications of DM encounter difficulties in transferring DM results into quantitative optimal control strategy. The fundamental reason might be the lack of a suitable format to construct the optimal control strategy. Therefore, this study firstly proposes a suitable control format for HVAC optimal control, i.e. the EDOC formatted as \u201cevent-policy-action\u201d. Aiming at automating the formulation process of HVAC optimal control strategy with minimal expert involvement, this study then adopts a DM approach (using random forest algorithm) to identify critical events from the historical operation data of HVAC systems, based on which the EDOC control strategies are directly constructed. The rest of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents the methodology, including the framework of EDOC and the method of identifying event state variables and event thresholds. Then, case study and simulation set-up are introduced in Section 3. Finally, results and conclusions are given. 2 Methodology This part firstly introduces the EDOC framework. Then, a DM approach is proposed to identify the event state variables and event thresholds. The \u201coptimal control reward\u201d is introduced for evaluating the relative importance of event candidates. Based on the commonly available HVAC operation data, the decision vector distance is defined to quantitatively estimate the optimal control reward. 2.1 Framework of EDOC An EDOC strategy is realized by the so-called \u201cevent-policy-action\u201d format (see Fig. 2) , and is briefly explained as follows: \u2022 if no event occurs, no action will be taken; \u2022 if certain events occur, actions will be taken accordingly based on the policy to achieve certain objectives (e.g. energy efficiency). An event is a well-defined condition that describes a set of system state transitions that happen instantly or continuously (in a time period). For instance, the outdoor wet-bulb temperature change, the equipment on/off status change or the indoor occupancy variation ([3]) can be used to define an event. Three basic event attributes, namely timestamp, descriptive state variables, and threshold, are used to mathematically construct an event definition [32] (see Fig. 2), where the critical part is to identify a suitable event state variable and an event threshold [32]. An event determines when (or in what condition) to trigger the control optimization. After the optimization is triggered, the event-driven policy determines which action to be taken based on the observed event, which is basically a mapping from the event space (the set of events) to the action space (the set of control actions). In HVAC optimal control, an action can be temperature re-setting or turning on/off an equipment. 2.2 Optimal control reward 2.2.1 Illustration of optimal control reward In building HVAC systems, there are numerous potential state variables that can be used to define events. Similarly, the threshold of a state transition also has numerous quantities (e.g. changing by 10%, 20%, or 90%). Only the state variable, varying at a certain extend that could cause a significant influence on the specific objectives (such as the system operation efficiency), will be selected and defined as the event. Deciding which state variables and thresholds to be used is basically a decision-making problem. This study develops the selection criteria (shown below) based on the notion of optimal control reward. \u2022 If the estimated optimal control reward associated with the event candidate is \u201csignificant\u201d#, the event candidate is selected; \u2022 If the estimated optimal control reward associated with the event candidate is \u201cnot significant\u201d, the event candidate will not be selected. # the significance of an event candidate can be estimated based on statistics. To illustrate the idea of optimal control reward, a simple example is presented in Fig. 3 . Suppose the system COP ( S C O P ∗ ) is the optimal control objective (which is a common objective in HVAC optimal control [43]). SCOP is equal to the cooling or heating output of plant (kw) divided by the plant power input (kw) which mainly consists of pumps, fans, cooling towers and chillers. k is the index of time. V is the decision vector which contains all the settings of decision variables. S is the system state vector which contains all the state variables. When control optimization is triggered, the optimal control settings are computed and reset. Following observations would be observed in system operations: (1) If the system state# (or operation condition) remains the same at time k-1 and time k (case a of Fig. 3, S k − 1 = S k ), the optimal decision vector remains unchanged (i.e. V k = V k − 1 ) and the SCOP remains the same as well (i.e. S C O P k V k = S C O P k − 1 V k − 1 ); (2) When the system state varies (case b of Fig. 3, S k − 1 ≠ S k ), if still using the previous operation setting V k − 1 , the S C O P k V k − 1 (SCOP at time k using V k − 1 ) would not be optimal since the previous setting V k − 1 is not optimal for the current system state S k . *: S C O P = c o o l i n g o r h e a t i n g o u t p u t o f p l a n t ( k w ) p l a n t p o w e r i n p u t ( k w ) where a plant typically consists of chillers, cooling towers, pumps and fans. #: system state are basically system operation variables that are related to the decision to be made, e.g. water/air flow rate, water/air temperature, pump/fan frequency, equipment power, ambient condition, etc. By optimizing the decision variable vector from V k − 1 to V k , the SCOP (at time k ) would be improved compared with the one using V k − 1 . The SCOP would be improved from S C O P k V k − 1 to S C O P k V k , and the SCOP gap is termed as optimal control reward (highlighted in Fig. 3). In summary, when the system state ( S k ) deviates from the previous one ( S k − 1 ) , the previous settings of decision vector ( V k − 1 ) will not be optimal. Thus, an action is necessary to be triggered to optimize the decision vector, i.e. resetting to V k for an optimal efficiency. Therefore, the correlation between the necessity of the optimization and a non-zero difference between the adjacent decision vectors can be established [44]. Moreover, the bigger the difference is, the higher the necessity of the optimization. Since the variation of decision vector is aroused by the system state transition, an event is thus defined to capture the system state transition, especially the critical ones. In this way, using the \u201cevent\u201d to drive optimization action will lead to a more efficient optimal control for the HVAC system operation comparing with using time to drive the optimization. 2.2.2 Estimator of optimal control reward: decision vector distance To estimate the optimal control reward (or the necessity of optimal control), the Euclidean distance between adjacent decision vectors is defined. As we know in data science, the deviation between objects is usually called \u201cdissimilarity\u201d [45], and the commonly used dissimilarity measure is the Euclidean distance. Suppose the decision vector contains \u201cn\u201d decision variables V k = v 1 , k , \u2026 , v n , k ; k is the index of time. The Euclidean distance between adjacent decision vectors is defined in Eqn. (1). (1) d k = ( v 1 , k − v 1 , k − 1 ) 2 + \u2026 + ( v n , k − v n , k − 1 ) 2 To eliminate the scale effect in the dataset, data normalization is always performed as shown in Eqn. (2). In this study, the normalized Euclidean distance ( d k , n o r m ) is used as an estimator of the optimal control reward. (2) d k , n o r m = ( v 1 , k , n o r m − v 1 , k − 1 , n o r m ) 2 + \u2026 + ( v n , k , n o r m − v n , k − 1 , n o r m ) 2 (3) v n , n o r m = ( v n − v n , m i n ) / ( v n , m a x − v n , m i n ) 2.3 Identifying event state variables and event thresholds 2.3.1 Methodology overview To construct an event (or an EDOC strategy), the major tasks are to identify the state variables and the event thresholds. The schematic of the methodology is shown in Fig. 4 and described as follows. Δ S k = ( Δ s 1 , k , \u2026 , Δ s m , k ) , Δ s i , k = | s i , k − s i , k − 1 | , i = 1 , \u2026 , m (1) Identify important state variable(s). First, input operation data and calculate Δ S k and d n o r m , based on which to establish the regression function by random forest algorithm. The variable importance will be evaluated accordingly (see section 2.3.2). Based on the evaluation result, important state variable(s) can be identified (denoted as s j ). (2) Identify event threshold(s). Then, compute the d n o r m for all the operation data. Record the time instance that the d k , n o r m is greater than the mean d n o r m , m e a n (which is considered as \u201csignificant\u201d). Identify the corresponding Δ s k , i , and continues the process until all the data is visited. Lastly, decide the event threshold based on the identified Δ s k , i . Note that the process in Fig. 4 is designed to run automatically, and thus each step is designed to be explicit and quantitative. The significant d n o r m is treated as the value greater than the population mean. This could be arbitrary and is for the demonstration purpose only. Other reasonable specifications are acceptable. 2.3.2 Evaluate variable importance by random forest In this study, random forest (RF) algorithm was used to evaluate the variable importance regarding the optimal control reward (estimated by the d k , n o r m ). RF is a regression method for global sensitivity analysis, which has an inherent measurement to evaluate the \u201cvariable importance\u201d. RF constructs multiple decision trees (a forest) based on selections of random features of the data. Variables are randomly picked at each node of the tree, which decreases the correlation between the trees in the forest, and thus decreasing the error rate. RF have been found to be excellent comparing with other machine learning algorithms [46] and traditional logistic regression models [47]. RF is also capable of handling highly correlated data [48]. Therefore, RF is suitable to be used in this study to evaluate the variable importance. In RF, the variable importance is computed based on the index %IncMSE as shown in Eqn. (4), where \u201c MSE ( − Δ s i ) \u201d stands for the mean squared error (MSE) if the variable s i is not used in the prediction. A small %IncMSE can be interpreted as: without certain variable s i , the MSE does not increase much, meaning that the contribution of Δ s i to the model output is not significant. On the contrary, a higher %IncMSE suggests that the variable s i is more important. (4) %IncMSE ( Δ s i ) = MSE ( − Δ s i ) − MSE MSE × 100 % 2.3.3 Specifying event thresholds The event threshold is a user-decided parameter. In order to select a suitable threshold value for the event state variables, a simple method is suggested based on the proposed decision vector distance. Since the event should associate with the \u201clarge\u201d optimal control reward (indicated by the \u201clarge\u201d d k , n o r m ), large d k , n o r m is firstly defined. Then, the state transitions associated with the large d k , n o r m are identified for selecting the event threshold. Eqn. (5) defines the \u201clarge\u201d d k , n o r m based on the common statistics that \u201clarge\u201d should at least be greater than the mean. Eqn. (6) identifies the time index k of \u201clarge\u201d d k , n o r m , which is denoted as I n d l . The corresponding state vector variations associated with the \u201clarge\u201d d k , n o r m can be identified using the I n d l , which are represented in Eqn. (7). Finally, the event threshold is calculated based on Eqn. (8) using the mean of the state vector variation. (5) d n o r m , l ∶ = { ∀ d k , n o r m > d n o r m , m e a n , k = { 1,2 , \u2026 , n } } (6) I n d l ∶ = { ∀ k , d k , n o r m > d n o r m , m e a n , k = { 1,2 , \u2026 , n } } (7) Δ S l ∶ = { Δ S k , k ∈ I n d l } (8) σ Δ S k ∶ = { ∑ Δ S k | I n d l | , k ∈ I n d l } ( | A | means the size of data set A .) 3 Case study and simulation set-up 3.1 Case system A case HVAC system is established in this section. The case HVAC system serves a skyscraper in subtropical region in China. The whole year weather and cooling load data were recorded. The daily average temperature ranges from 21.5 °C to 31.2 °C with an average 78% relative humidity and the cooling load data ranges from 3268 kW to 22996 kW. Fig. 5 (a) shows the schematic diagram of the HVAC system, which consists of a cooling water loop, a primary chilled water loop and a secondary chilled water loop. Four temperature set-points are dynamically reset to chase for an optimal operation performance, namely cooling water supply temperature, primary chilled water supply temperature, secondary chilled water supply temperature and supply air temperature. Fig. 5 (b) is a figure of the simulated TRNSYS project. Table 3 lists the specifications of the major equipment. Note that the air-side system is simplified as one cooling coil handling all the loads. The occupancy factor is also important, especially for the demand-oriented ventilation and outdoor air control. However, this constitutes a separate topic ([49]), and the occupancy factor is not separately considered in the current optimal control problem. 3.2 Optimal control problem As mentioned, the decision variables are four temperature set-points, while the control objective is to minimize the system total power requirement at each time instant. The optimal control problem is formulated as the minimization of system total power requirement at each time instance (see Eqns. 9 and 10). Each decision variable has its operation range (shown in Table 4 ). (9) ( T c w s o p , T c h w s , p r m o p , T c h w s , s e c o p , T s a o p ) = a r g m i n P s y s , t o t ( T c w s , T c h w s , p r m , T c h w s , s e c , T s a ) (10) P s y s , t o t = P c h , t o t + P c t , t o t + P p u m p , t o t + P f a n , t o t where T o p is the optimal set-point of the corresponding temperature; P c h , t o t , P c t , t o t , P p u m p , t o t , P f a n , t o t are total power requirement of chillers, cooling towers pumps, and fans. To obtain an optimal set-point, the optimization procedure of EDOC is shown in Table 5 , which consists of four components, namely triggering optimal control, calculating the objective function, applying constrains and optimization algorithm. Here, a simple but fast exhaustive search method was used. 3.3 Simulation set-up Since the simulation is an effective tool to test the optimal control performance [50], the TRNSYS was used as the simulation platform. Validated component models calibrated by field measured data were used to construct the component models of the HVAC system. The accuracy and details of component models are present in Table 6 . For simplicity, the AHU (air handling unit) model adopts the TRNSYS type 508, the heat exchanger model uses the TRNSYS type 699, and the PID model uses the TRNSYS type 23 (the PID settings: P = \u2013 0.95 and I = 35 s). Matlab was used to perform the control optimization and was linked with TRNSYS for the co-simulation to simulate the HVAC optimal control in operation. The TRNSYS simulation platform used verified component models including chillers, cooling towers, pumps, AHUs, and heat exchangers. Model details are presented in Table 3 of [51] and are not repeated here. Actual load and weather data were used in the simulation. The entire year has various load and weather data, but many load and weather profiles are similar. Thus, to speed up the computer simulation test, a K-means clustering approach was used to identify the typical load and weather data. The detailed K-means clustering approach can be found in Ref. [51]. The identified typical load and weather data are shown in Table 7 . The TRNSYS simulation duration for each load cluster was 24 h (i.e. one day) with a simulation time step of 30 s. During the simulation, the TRNSYS will mimic the actual operation, while the Matlab is responsible for the computation of optimal control set-points. Besides, the event definitions and event detection functions are also coded in Matlab. 4 Results and discussions This section firstly presents the data preparation and the implementation of RF algorithm. Then, the results of variable importance are presented with the defined events. These events are used to construct the EDOC strategy, and the corresponding control performance is demonstrated in section 4.3. Finally, the results and limitations are discussed. 4.1 Operation data preparation and random forest algorithm The data generated from the established simulation platform was used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DM approach. Based on a previous study [52], typical variables affecting the operation efficiency of HVAC systems were firstly identified to reduce the size of data to be investigated. These variables are associated with chilled water loop, cooling water loop, supply and return air loop, and the corresponding equipment. Based on the available data, six state variables were selected to be investigated, the range of the selected state variables are presented in Table 8 . The selected operation data was then processed using RF. RF algorithm was implemented in \u201cR\u201d which is an open platform for statistical computing and DM. The \u201crandomForest\u201d package (version 4.6\u201312) was used (documented in Ref. [53]), and the parameters were set as 500 trees with three variables at each split. 4.2 Identify state variables and event thresholds As shown in Fig. 6 , based on the \u201c%IncMSE\u201d value, the quantitative variable importance from high to low can be ranked as: PLR > M w , prm , pump > M w , sec , pump > F ct , fan > T db > T w b . It is noted that, when the variables describing the similar state change are used to define the events, there may exist duplication. To avoid the potential event duplication, less important variables in a similar state variable group were discarded. The \u201c M w , sec , pump \u201d was potentially duplicated with \u201c M w , prm , pump \u201d because they both reflect the chilled water flow. Thus, \u201c M w , sec , pump \u201d was not selected to avoid the potential frequent event triggering. \u201c T wb \u201d and \u201c T db \u201d were also discarded due to the low importance since the values of \u201c%IncMSE\u201d are less than 10%. Thus, PLR, M w , prm , pump and F ct , fan are selected as the critical state variables which will be used to define events. Then, the event thresholds should be specified to constitute a complete event definition. In this study, the thresholds were specified with the help of decision vector distance as presented in Eqn. (8). For instance, a histogram of F ct , fan significant change corresponding to large decision vector distance is shown in Fig. 7 , and the mean value (1.72 Hz) was used as the event threshold. Similarly, all the event thresholds are calculated and listed in Table 9. 4.3 Performance comparisons Based on the event definitions present above, the established event space consists of three events (see Table 9). This event space was tested regarding the energy saving performance and was compared with a traditional TDOC strategy. The energy saving percentage of a certain control strategy is calculated based on the baseline case in which no optimal control is done. Details of control strategies are listed in Table 10 . The time-driven strategy optimizing the system every 1 h was used as the benchmark. Compared with the benchmark, the EDOC strategy achieves higher energy saving percentages in the 10 typical load cases (see Fig. 8 ). The maximum and minimum energy saving improvement are 4.6% (case \u201cC4\u201d, a summer day) and 0.9% (case \u201cC1\u201d, a spring day) respectively. Overall speaking, the average energy saving in 10 load clusters is 10.2% which is higher than the benchmark 7.7%. It demonstrates that, by adopting the EDOC strategy using the proposed DM approach, the energy saving is superior to the traditional time-triggered strategy under a wide range of operation conditions. The optimization triggering time of EDOC and TDOC in one simulation run (i.e. 24 h or 2880 simulation steps) is shown in Fig. 9 (a), where x axis is the simulation time step and y axis is the cumulative optimization times. The cumulative optimization times increments by one when the optimization is triggered. The load cluster 6 (refer to \u201cC6\u201d in Table 6) is selected for this illustration. It can be seen that EDOC triggered the optimization in a non-periodic manner. When experienced rapid load changes (e.g. time step 721 to 1201 in Fig. 9 (b)), EDOC can allocate more optimizations than TDOC. When the operation condition is relatively stable (e.g. time step 1441 to 2401 in Fig. 9 (b)), EDOC can save unnecessary optimizations. For the load cluster C6, the EDOC obtained 9.5% of energy saving which is higher than the 8.2% of energy saving obtained by TDOC. Such performance improvement greatly benefit from the adaptive optimization mode of EDOC in response to the operation condition changes (e.g. load changes). 4.4 Discussions As discussed, most of the previous studies adopted domain knowledge to formulate the optimal control strategy for HVAC systems. However, using domain knowledge is difficult to quantify the parameters of the control, making it infeasible to automate the formulation of optimal control strategy. This study presents a DM approach to directly formulate the efficient optimal control strategy from DM results. A unified and easy-use EDOC format is proposed to guide the DM process. The RF algorithm is used to compute the variable importance in terms of the optimal control reward (which is estimated by the decision vector distance). In applications, when domain knowledge is limited (e.g. some newly developed HVAC systems may not have well-developed knowledge), the proposed DM approach can be a good supplement. More importantly, as the operation data is continuously fed into the DM engine, the proposed DM approach can customize the EDOC strategy for the targeted system in adaption to system and climatic changes. In this way, the formulated EDOC strategy can handle the HVAC optimal control more precisely and efficiently. Therefore, the formulated EDOC strategy (based on the operation data) achieves higher energy saving than the traditional TDOC strategy. Since a quantitative evaluation on variable importance is provided, it allows the automatic data processing. As the human expert intervention is minimized, the proposed DM approach can enable fast employment in applications, which indicates a good application potential. Recently, the reinforcement learning has also been investigated in HVAC optimal control [54], which has the appealing model-free feature. However, the construction of reinforcement learning still requires extensive expert involvements, e.g. establishing the reward function, gathering the training data and training the agent. Considering there are plenty data mining researches in HVAC field (not necessarily targeting for optimal control), it is beneficial to utilize and transfer the current research outcomes of data mining into efficient optimal control strategies, which is the primary target of the presented paper. It should be mentioned that the method of event threshold specification is simple (as presented in section 2.3.3). This study is mainly presented to illustrate the idea of adopting DM approach to directly formulate the EDOC strategy. Thus, the event threshold is selected based on simple equations (shown in Section 2.3.3). Basically, the threshold should not cause frequent event triggering (in this case, not too small) and should be reachable (in normal range). The presented threshold selection method satisfies both criterion. More advanced event threshold specification method can be investigated in the future. For example, DM technologies (e.g. association rule mining) can be used to identify the patterns between event thresholds and optimal control objective(s) and critical event thresholds could be identified with quantifications. The case study simplifies the indoor environment which is characterized by non-uniformly distributed parameters [55,56]. The prediction, control and management of the indoor environment are also essential in HVAC optimal control. As shown by literatures [57,58], the indoor environmental control could constitute a separate study and will be our future direction. The control performance verification is limited to a simulation-based study. The simulation platform was constructed based on validated models. However, field experimental verifications should also be pursued in the future. Besides, more operation data covering a wide range of operation conditions should be collected to enable a good applicability of the optimal control strategy. Since this study proposes a DM approach, new data can be continuously used in offline to update the EDOC optimal control strategy, e.g. updating the event thresholds or even the event definitions. Therefore, with the proliferation of data measurement infrastructures in buildings and the accumulation of time, the amount and diversity of data may not be a critical issue. 5 Conclusions To improve the operation of existing building HVAC systems, the system control and operation should be emphasized since they are the major contributor for the widely existed deficiency problems. Instead of using domain knowledge or simulation results, this study proposes a data mining approach to facilitate the formulation of efficient optimal control strategy in HVAC systems. The data mining algorithm, random forest, is used to discover useful information inside the operation data for HVAC optimal control. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through simulation case studies, which shows that the formulated event-driven optimal control strategy can improve the energy saving percentage by 0.9%\u20134.6% comparing with the traditionally used time-driven optimal control strategy. The contribution of the presented work can be summarized as follows: \u2022 Provide a standard event-driven optimal control format to represent air conditioning optimal control strategy. \u2022 Improve the energy saving by 0.9%\u20134.6% compared with the traditional time-driven optimal control strategy. \u2022 Enable the automatic and quantitative formulation of optimal control strategies with minimal expert involvement. Thus, the implementation of data mining approach can be fast. \u2022 Considering to the data driven feature, the proposed data-mining-powered event-driven optimal control is customizable for a specific building system and adaptable to system renovations. \u2022 The event-driven optimal control is easy to use and can be easily understood by designers, engineers, and building operators. The conclusions of this work can guide the optimal control of building HVAC plant systems. Since the proposed data mining approach can be fully quantified, automatic formulation of the HVAC optimal control strategy can be expected. Thus, the presented approach can enable the fast employment (with minimal expert involvement) in actual applications to improve the operation efficiency of HVAC systems. In the future, the experimental validation and the advanced event threshold specification method will be set as the future work.

        "dc:description": "Heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems contribute to a major portion of energy consumption in buildings. Real-time optimal control is an efficient tool to improve the HVAC system efficiency. The formulation of the optimal control strategy is, however, challenging due to the lack of quantitative approaches and unified control format. Many previous studies use domain knowledge or experts\u2019 interpretations to develop the optimal control strategy, which is qualitative, time-consuming and labor-intensive. This study proposes a data-mining-powered event-driven optimal control (EDOC) for improving HVAC operation efficiency. The main contributions are: (1) Provide a standard EDOC format to represent HVAC optimal control strategy; (2) Enable the automatic and quantitative formulation of optimal control strategies with minimal expert involvement. The random forest algorithm is adopted to discover event-driven relationships in the operation data. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through simulations. On average, the formulated EDOC strategy increases the energy saving by 0.9%\u20134.6% compared with a traditional time-driven optimal control. Meanwhile, events can be customized and can adapt to system renovations. The formulated EDOC is easy to use and can be easily understood by engineers and operators, which can be used to guide the optimal control of building HVAC systems.",
