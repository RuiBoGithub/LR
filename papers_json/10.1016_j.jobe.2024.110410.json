Institution: School of Municipal and Environmental Engineering Shenyang Jianzhu University Liaoning Province Zip Code: 110168 China At present, most optimization objectives of heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems focus on the local optimization of equipment during cooling hours, usually ignoring the importance of the end conditions. In addition, traditional control methods may not perform well in complex or dynamic systems. Therefore, in this study, a hybrid model-free control (HMFC) strategy was developed that combines deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with L-BFGS-B and expert knowledge to improve its ability to cope with complex system environments. This strategy was used to optimize the cooling and heating periods of a groundwater source heat pump system in a bitterly cold region of China throughout the year, considering the end-of-system conditions. L-BFGS-B optimized the fresh-air ratios for the end air-handling unit, whereas DRL achieved global optimization of the heat pump outlet temperature, air-conditioning water circulation pump frequency, and submersible-pump frequency. To verify the effectiveness of the strategy, a simulation platform was built based on actual data and device parameters, and the simulation results of HMFC and model predictive control (MPC) were output, compared, and analyzed with data of the system measured in 2022 under expert rule-based manual control (RBC). The results show that HMFC was 7.38 % and 9.38 % more energy efficient than RBC during heating hours, respectively. HMFC was 24.26 % more energy efficient than RBC and 10.03 % more energy efficient than MPC during cooling hours. Moreover, the distribution of the system coefficient of performance under the HMFC method was more concentrated in the higher range, indicating that the proposed HMFC can save energy savings. Thus, it is a feasible optimization scheme for buildings without a large number of historical data. Finally, the strategy was applied to a real engineering experimental analysis, and the engineering practice results show that the strategy is robust and practical.

The total energy consumption of public buildings, owing to their characteristics, often exceeds that of other building types [2]. Heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems contribute significantly to energy consumption; therefore, optimizing the energy management of HVAC systems is crucial. In the design and construction processes in the construction industry, the actual working conditions are not exactly the same as the design conditions; therefore, real-time control and adjustment in the actual operation are necessary to achieve the best energy utilization effect. Optimizing the operating parameters of HVAC systems is crucial for reducing energy consumption. The 2019 \u201cGreen and Efficient Refrigeration Action Plan\u201d issued by the Chinese government emphasizes efficient operation of computer room equipment, and it has generated extensive research. In 2012, the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) highlighted that adjusting the outlet temperature of chilled water (Thps) positively affects chiller (heat pump) energy efficiency [3]. This approach is more practical than modifying the internal compressor frequency of the chiller (heat pump) [4]. However, high Thps levels can decrease fluid flow in pipelines and alter the pump operating points. Therefore, it is necessary to optimize heat pump systems globally rather than locally. Currently, HVAC control methods are divided into three main types: rule-based control (RBC), model predictive control (MPC), and model-free control (MFC) [5]. RBC is highly applicable to traditional HVAC optimization control strategies. However, when the system operation state changes, its optimization ability is weakened, and it is difficult to provide the best operation strategy promptly [6]. In recent years, MPC has emerged as a dynamic control method for overcoming the limitations of RBC. Widely studied and applied, MPC improves the energy efficiency and stability of HVAC systems, leading to significant energy savings. Kang et al. [7] indicated that MPC relies on actual data, and the quality of these data directly affects the accuracy of the model and, consequently, the MPC results. Therefore, problems involving historical data must be considered in practical applications. In addition, for buildings without extensive historical data, establishing a performance model for the system equipment may be challenging. Moreover, some variations in energy systems exist among different buildings, further increasing the complexity and economy of the establishment and application of MPC. Overall, physical constraints and model uncertainties have raised concerns regarding the robustness of MPC [8]. Therefore, an increasing number of researchers have combined deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with MFC to solve these problems. Traditional HVAC optimization methods often struggle to meet energy efficiency and indoor thermal comfort requirements. Recent advancements in artificial-intelligence (AI) technology have provided promising opportunities in this field [9]. AI reduces the building energy consumption by enhancing control and automation [10]. Machine learning (ML), a crucial branch of AI, offers solutions for achieving a balance between energy efficiency and thermal comfort [11]. Reinforcement learning (RL), one of the three branches of ML, significantly improves energy efficiency when combined with MFC [12]. Because of its adaptive optimal control characteristics, it has been gradually applied to control optimization of HVAC systems [13]. However, when the state space of the system is very large or continuous, RL faces challenges, such as dimensional catastrophe and computational complexity; therefore, researchers have proposed DRL algorithms, which offer a more powerful function approximation and handling of complex inputs, and combined them with MFC. Zou et al. [14] realized the optimal control of an air-handling unit (AHU) based on DRL, and the experimental results revealed that the energy savings were 27%\u201330 % compared with the actual energy consumption. He et al. [15] combined long short-term memory with DRL to predict the cooling load and reset the Thps. The energy saving of this method was 9 %, surpassing that of RBC. Although DRL control can save energy because of its large state space, the agent interacts with the external environment to transmit information through repeated trials during the optimization process, making rapid convergence challenging. Therefore, Nguyen et al. [16] developed a learning framework for HVAC control based on DRL. The results demonstrated a reduction in energy consumption ranging from 2 % to 14 % compared with that of the traditional method, accompanied by a notable improvement in the convergence speed, which increased by 66 %. Qiu et al. [17] combined RL with expert rules and achieved a 4.36 % reduction in energy consumption in the first cooling season. The energy savings were significant, with acceptable robustness and learning speed, demonstrating that the different methods can be combined. Traditional optimization algorithms, which are limited to dynamic optimization, seek the optimal solutions. The limited-memory Broyden\u2013Fletcher\u2013Goldfarb\u2013Shanno with Bounds algorithm for solving large nonlinear optimization problems subject to simple boundary constraints of variables (L-BFGS-B) can solve large-scale constraint issues while reducing memory requirements by limiting stored historical information. Moreover, it can achieve rapid global convergence [18]. It is suitable for use in optimized HVAC control. Ho et al. [19] employed L-BFGS-B to optimize chiller load distribution, which resulted in significant energy savings. Most previous studies have verified the energy efficiency of their strategies in cooling hours, whereas few studies have optimized the heating and cooling hours throughout the year and analyzed the differences in their energy efficiency. Although a control strategy based on DRL can realize energy savings for the system, it has the problem of difficult and slow convergence. Previous research focused on the local optimization of equipment inside the machine room and often ignored the importance of the end working conditions. To solve the above problems and realize the potential of system energy saving, an innovative hybrid model-free control (HMFC) strategy was developed based on Python. It combines deep-Q-network (DQN), a DRL algorithm, with expert knowledge and L-BFGS-B. The convergence and controllability of the model in complex environments were improved significantly. This strategy was used to optimize the cooling and heating conditions of a groundwater source heat pump plant room in a bitter-cold region throughout the year. Global optimization was achieved by optimizing the heat pump load-side heat exchanger outlet temperature (Thps), air-conditioning water circulation pump frequency (facwp), submersible-pump frequency (fsp), and fresh-air ratio of the AHU (Rfa) to reduce the system energy consumption to the maximum extent. The main contributions of this research are as follows. (1) The HMFC strategy combines DQN with L-BFGS-B under the constraints of expert knowledge, which improves the learning speed and robustness of the model and results in good performance in practical engineering applications. (2) Compared with previous approaches, the HMFC strategy is more fully considered, and is not limited by historical data. The main energy-consuming equipment and terminal Rfa in the heat pump room were globally optimized during the cooling and heating periods, and the causes of the energy-saving differences in different periods were analyzed. The results show that the HMFC strategy can maximize energy savings while ensuring indoor comfort. 2 Case system 2.1 System introduction The focus of this study was on an office building in Shenyang, China. The building comprises seven floors, with a total construction area of 26,906 m2. The air-conditioning system comprised a constant-air-volume full-air system and a fan coil with a fresh-air system at the end. Each floor was equipped with an AHU. Fig. 1 shows the actual operating equipment of the case system. The heat pump room has three groundwater source heat pump units and three inverter air-conditioning water circulation pumps (ACWPs). Three inverter submersible pumps (SPs)are set up in the groundwater source section. Variable-frequency water pumps are operated in parallel. Because the building underwent an energy-saving transformation, the original ACWP was not replaced, resulting in an overestimated ACWP rated flow rate (Facwp,e). Consequently, the temperature difference between the supply and return water (Δtgh) on the user side was minimal. These issues are analyzed in Section 3.2. The system layout is shown in Fig. 2 , and the models and main parameters of the heat pump, pump, and AHU are listed in Tables 1\u20133 . For this building system, data were collected over one year, from January 1 to December 31, 2022. Table 4 lists the monitoring equipment used in this study. The monitoring results are presented in Sections 3.2, 4.2, and 5.2. 2.2 System running state The existing systems were manually controlled according to expert rules from November 1 to March 15 of the following year for the air-conditioning heating period and from June 1 to September 19 for the air-conditioning cooling period. During the cooling and heating seasons, the daytime system operated from 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. During the cooling and heating seasons, the system was operated according to the minimum fresh-air ratio (Rfa, min). In addition, the air conditioning was not activated at night during the refrigeration and transition seasons. However, during the heating season, heating was maintained during the nighttime hours. The per capita areas of the floors of the building are listed in Table 5 . 2.3 Case system constraints (1) The models of the parallel heat, submersible, and air-conditioning water circulation pumps were identical. (2) The actual numbers of operating components of the submersible and air-conditioning water circulation pumps were the same as those of the heat pumps. 3 Methodology 3.1 Deep Q-network A DQN is a DRL algorithm that can solve Markov decision processes (MDPs). When using an MDP to model the environment, one can represent it as a tuple {s, a, T, R, γ}, where s is the state of the environment, a is the action performed by the agent, T is the probability of transitioning from one state to another, R is the reward the agent receives for performing a specific action in a specific state, and γ is the discount factor, with γ ∈ [0, 1] [20]. These are the basic elements of the MDP and describe the interactions between the agent and environment. They provide a basis for modeling and solving problems using a DQN. Therefore, the HVAC system in this study is described as an MDP environment, as shown in Figs. 3 and 4 depicts the detailed implementation principle of the DQN algorithm in an MDP environment. The process is as follows. (1) The environment is built and initiated, the experience replay buffer is established, and a deep neural network is created. (2) The agent selects actions using a greedy strategy, executes them in the environment, observes the next state of the environment (s_) and reward (r), and determines whether to terminate the exploration. (3) The observed experience samples are stored in the experience replay buffer, and a batch of samples is randomly selected for agent training. (4) The weights and biases of the target neural network are updated as follows. a. The target Q-value is calculated based on the Bellman equation. (1) Q target = r + γ * max ( Q ( s _ , a ; q target ) where r denotes the reward corresponding to the current state, s_ represents the next state, a_ is the next action, θtarget represents the parameters of the target neural network, and max(Q(s_, a_; θtarget)) denotes the selection of the action with the maximum Q-value in the next state. b. The loss function is calculated. (2) loss = ( Q ( s , a ; θ ) − Q target ) 2 where θ is the parameter of the current neural network, θ = θ-α*▽θ(loss), α represents the learning rate, and ▽θ denotes the parameter gradient. The weights and biases of the target network are updated through backpropagation to minimize the loss function. (5) It is determined whether the termination condition is satisfied. If convergence or a set number of cycles is reached, the training cycle is terminated. Otherwise, the process is repeated by returning to Step (1). After the above process is complete, the DQN comprises two neural networks, the behavioral network and target network, which help improve the stability and training of the algorithm. The behavioral network is the main neural network in the DQN and is used to estimate the Q-value of performing action a in a given state s. The target network is a concept introduced to stabilize the training process, which is used to estimate the target Q-value independently and has exactly the same structure as the behavioral network; however, the behavioral network is updated more frequently than the target network because the parameters of the target network are copied from the behavioral network at regular intervals. In summary, during training, the Q-value of the behavioral network is used to make decisions about actions, whereas the Q-value of the target network is used to compute the expected reward plus the maximum Q-value of the next state s_. However, the updating of neural networks is not an ongoing process. The concept of a loss function is introduced in the DQN, which is used to measure the difference between the behavioral network and the target network. The gradient of the loss function over the parameters of the behavioral network is calculated using the backpropagation algorithm, and the gradient descent method is applied to update the parameters of the network so that the predictive ability and behavioral strategy of the network can be continuously improved. This makes the predicted Q-value gradually approach the true Q-value. When the two Q-values gradually approach each other, the DQN begins to converge. Therefore, the design of the dual-network structure enables the DQN to have a more stable training process and accelerates the convergence speed. Therefore, in this study, the DQN was used as the main optimization method for HMFC. 3.2 Environment setup To analyze the exploration and convergence of the agent more intuitively, a maze environment was established based on Thps, facwp, and fsp. The environment was classified into four modules: the fsp, facwp, and Thps optimization modules and the end reward module. With different rewards for different modules, this variation prompts the agent to explore the environment and learn to discover the optimal policy. In practical engineering, frequent changes in equipment parameters can affect equipment performance. To mitigate this, the parameter increment in each module is set to 1, within the allowable range of the equipment, with a time step of 1 h. Specifically, the pump frequencies of Modules 1 and 3 are set in the interval of [35, 50]. The water outlet temperature of Module 2 varies depending on the season: it ranges from 40 °C to 55 °C in winter and from 5 °C to 15 °C in summer. Equations (3)\u2013(6) represent the exploration conditions for an agent in the environment, where \u201cdone = True\u201d signifies the termination of exploration, whereas \u201cdone = False\u201d indicates that the exploration continues. (3) Module 1 = { done = False if | H sp , a × 9.8 − f gw | ≤ 1 andF hp , gw , min ≤ F sp , a ≤ F hp , gw , max done = True otherwise (4) Module 2 = { done = False if | Q hp , a | ≥ | Q min , total | done = True otherwise (5) Module 3 = { done = False if | H acwp , a × 9.8 − f pip | ≤ 1 and max ( F hp . l . min , | Q min , total | / c × Δ t 2 ) ≤ F acwp , a ≤ min ( F hp . l . max , | Q min , total | / c × Δ t 1 ) done = True otherwise (6) Module 4 = { done = True } Here, Hsp,a and Hacwp,a denote the actual heads of the ACWP and SP, respectively (mH20), Qhp,a represents the actual cooling capacity/heat output of the heat pump (kW), calculated as described in Section 4.2, Qmin, total is the minimum amount of cooling/heating (CEB/HEB) that the heat pump system must provide, calculated using L-BFGS-B (kW), fpip and fgw denote the real-time resistances of the user-side and underground water source-side pipelines, respectively (Pa), and Fhp,l,min and Fhp,gw,min represent the minimum flows of the heat exchanger between the heat pump load side and the underground water source side, respectively. Similarly, Fhp,l,max and Fhp,gw,max represent the maximum flows of the heat exchanger between the sides. The maximum and minimum flow rates of the heat exchanger are set as Fe ± 30 %, where Fe is the rated flow rate of the heat exchanger (m3/h). In Module 3, the constraints of expert knowledge are introduced to accelerate the convergence of the agent. The Facwp,e of the retrofitted system is too large, resulting in excessive water flow when CEB/HEB is small, even if facwp = 35 Hz, which results in Δtgh being too small. Fig. 5 illustrates these fluctuations over the heat pump operation in 2022, totaling 2784 h. Generally, Δtgh fluctuates at a temperature difference of approximately ±2 °C. However, exceptions exist, notably during the early part of the second heat-production period. Because the objective of the study is to optimize control in existing buildings for energy savings, Δtgh is controlled within the interval of [3,8]. Specifically, Δt1 is set to 3 °C and Δt2 to 8 °C based on the actual system conditions during the optimization. Furthermore, when extending the strategy to other buildings, Δtgh can be controlled within the interval of [5,8] according to the general design conditions. This approach ensures adaptability and effectiveness across various building scenarios. Moreover, when the value corresponding to Hacwp,a (Pa) has an error of less than 1 from fpip, the frequency is considered acceptable. In addition, it is considered that the system will have problems, such as equipment on-site scheduling or algorithmic judgment errors, during actual engineering operation, leading to data anomalies. Thus, to ensure that the HMFC has good robustness, the following constraints are imposed based on expert knowledge. If a complaint of overheating (overcooling) or |Thps,dt+1 − Thps,dt| > 25 °C is received from indoor people in the next time period (dt + 1), the algorithm automatically changes Thps to the low/standard temperature, and the intelligent body refinds the corresponding strategy based on this temperature. This improves the reliability of indoor comfort while ensuring good robustness. 3.3 Parameter setting In this study, optimizing the end Rfa included prioritizing indoor personnel comfort while maximizing system efficiency. The total power consumption (Ptotal) serves as the basis for the reward function, where a lower Ptotal corresponds to a greater system coefficient of performance (COP), while still satisfying CEB/HEB. Equations (7) and (8) illustrate the formulation of Ptotal as a reward. (7) P total = ( P sp , a + P hp , a + P acwp , a ) × n 2 (8) Reward = − 1 × P total where Ptotal is the total power consumption of the system (kW), Reward is the optimization objective (reward), Psp,a is the power consumption of a single SP (kW), Php,a is the actual power consumption of a single heat pump (kW), Pacwp,a is the actual power consumption of a single ACWP (kW), and n1 and n2 are the numbers of devices turned on by the system under the RBC/MPC and HMFC policies, respectively, as shown in Equations (9) and (10). The DQN states, rewards, and action settings are listed in Table 6 . (9) n 1 = { 0 PLR < 0.3 1 PLR ≤ 1.0 2 PLR ≤ 2.0 3 otherwise (10) n 2 = { 0 PLR < 0.3 1 PLR ≤ 0.8 2 PLR ≤ 1.6 3 otherwise The settings of the DQN parameters play a crucial role in the performance and stability of the algorithm. First, to set the neural-network parameters, the two neural networks in the DQN comprised two hidden layers and 32 neurons. Because the initial values of the weights in the neural network significantly affect the accuracy and convergence of the model, the weights are randomly initialized in a uniformly distributed manner to avoid situations in which the values of the weights are equal to the local extremes, and a rectified linear unit is used as the activation function of the hidden layer to accelerate the convergence of the intelligences. Second, the setting of the experience playback parameters, which include the parameters of the experience playback buffer and the size of the batch, and the size of the experience playback buffer affect the performance and stability of the algorithm. The size of the buffer affects the convergence and learning efficiency of the algorithm; therefore, the memory size is set to 2000. The batch size indicates the number of samples randomly extracted from the experience playback buffer and is set to 256. Finally, regarding the setting of other parameters, in the DQN, the exploration factor ε in the ε-greedy strategy is adjusted by linear decay so that the intelligent body in the early stage of training is more inclined to explore; thus, Δε is set to 0.0005. With the decay of ε in the late stage of training, the intelligent body is more inclined to use the experience and learned knowledge to explore; thus, εmin is set to 0.01. The size of γ characterizes how much the intelligent body values the future rewards. The closer γ is to 0, the more the intelligent body values the current rewards. To avoid the local optimization problem, γ is set to 0.7. The update frequency of the target network is set to 200. The settings of the DQN parameters are listed in Table 7 . 3.4 System control flow The load distribution of the parallel heat pump units affects their actual power consumption, and Thps is not the same under different loads. In this study, the optimal load distribution method proposed by Chang et al. [21] was used. It is based on the principle of average distribution, and the load of the heat pump units is evenly distributed. In engineering practice, a load-averaged distribution is achieved by controlling Thps, as in Equation (11). (11) CL i = C p × ρ × F hp , i × ( T hpr , i − T hps , i ) ÷ 3600 s / h where CL i is the load shared by the i heat pump unit (kW), Cp is the specific heat capacity of water (4.2 kJ/(kg.K)), ρ is the density of water (1000 kg/m³), Fhp,i is the flow rate of the chilled water/hot water outlet of the i heat pump unit (m³/h), Thpr,i is the temperature of the chilled-water/hot-water return of the i heat pump unit (°C), and Thps,i is the temperature of the chilled-water/hot-water supply of the i unit (°C). The system optimization control is divided into five parts, in which the heat pump start/stop is controlled sequentially. The control flow is shown in Fig. 6 , and a specific description of the algorithmic process is provided in the Supplementary Document. Regarding the training of the intelligent body, offline and then online, the intelligent body is trained offline based on historical data to generate a stable optimization model, which is then put into the online environment for real-time inference and decision making to improve its online optimization performance. Owing to the complexity of the environment, the intelligent body is trained for 1000 episodes to achieve convergence. 3.5 Research process The overall flow of this study is shown in Fig. 7 . It was divided into four steps. (1) The HVAC optimal control problem was formulated to fill the gaps in previous research and define the research methodology (see Sections 1, 2, and 3 for detailed analysis). (2) A TRNSYS\u2013Python cosimulation platform was built to create an HVAC model based on building drawings and historical data (see Section 4 for detailed information), and it was used for the third step of the HMFC performance evaluation. (3) The performance of the HMFC strategy was evaluated to analyze its energy efficiency and convergence and to analyze the reasons for the energy efficiency variability of HMFC during heating and cooling periods. The results of this evaluation are presented in Section 5. (4) A practical engineering demonstration, which analyzes the ability of HMFC to handle anomalous data points and its practical feasibility, was performed. It is described in Section 6. 4 Build simulation platform To explore the energy-saving potential of the HMFC, the device was modeled in a simulation environment, and the scientific accuracy of the model was verified. The simulation environment was Python 3.6, and the neural-network model was constructed using PyTorch. 4.1 Fresh air ratio Most of the buildings in the case study had an open-plan office layout with a small number of individual offices on each floor. The end-open office areas had an entire-air system, whereas independent offices used a fan coil in combination with a fresh-air system. Considering the small percentage of fan coils in the end system and to simplify the calculation and management, in this study, the air-conditioning system in the end area was regarded as an all-air constant-volume system. The building model in TRNSYS or existing load-forecasting algorithms [22,23] were used to simulate Qcl. A TRNSYS simulation was conducted in this study. Based on the design drawing simulation, Fig. 8 shows the results of the simulation of Qcl versus CEB/HEB for the air-conditioning season using the RBC methodology. In the HMFC method, the real-time minimum CEB/HEB is calculated using L-BFGS-B (see Section 5.3 for a detailed analysis), and the objective function is shown in Equation (12). (12) Q min , i = | G fa , i × ( h outdoor − h fa , i ) + Q cl , i | (13) Q min , total = ∑ i = 1 q Q min , i where Qmin,i is the minimum CEB/HEB of floor i, which is the dependent variable of the objective function (kW), Gfa,i is the fresh-air volume of floor i, which is the independent variable of the objective function (kg/s), hfa,i is the enthalpy of fresh air, houtdoor,i is the enthalpy of the outdoor air of floor i, and q is the total number of floors (q = 7). The boundary conditions are expressed by Equations (14) and (15), and, according to the current Chinese code, \u201cDesign Code for Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning of Civil Buildings\u201d (GB50736-2012), which was adopted in this study, the minimum fresh-air volume per capita was set at 30 m³/h and Rfa ≥ 30 %.

(16) Q h , a = α h × Q h , e (17) Q c , a = α c × Q c , e (18) α c = a 0 + a 1 × T evap + a 2 × T cond + a 3 × T evap 2 + a 4 × T evap × T cond + a 5 × T cond 2 + a 6 × T evap 2 × T cond + a 7 × T cond 2 × T evap + a 8 × T cond 3 (19) α h = a 0 + a 1 × T evap + a 2 × T cond + a 3 × T evap 2 + a 4 × T evap × T cond + a 5 × T cond 2 + a 6 × T evap 3 + a 7 × T evap 2 × T cond + a 8 × T cond 2 × T evap + a 9 × T cond 3 where Qh,a is the actual heating capacity of the heat pump, Qh,e is the rated heating capacity of the heat pump, Qc,a is the actual cooling capacity of the heat pump, and Qc,e is the rated cooling capacity of the heat pump. Here, Tevap is the temperature of the water coming out of the evaporator, Tcond is the temperature of the condenser discharge water, αc is the correction factor for the heat pump cooling capacity, αh is the correction factor for the heat pump heating capacity, and a0, a1, a2 \u2026 a9 are the fitting coefficients. To simplify the calculation, the heat loss inside the heat pump was neglected, and the heat exchanger inside the heat pump exchanged the same amount of heat. (20) Q evap = Q cond = c p × m × Δ t gh where m is the mass flow rate through the heat exchanger (m³/h). Equations (21)\u2013(24) model the actual electric power (Php, a) of the heat pump.

Here, Php,a varies at different partial loading rates (PLR). (25) P hp , e = Q min , total / ( n × COP ) (26) COP = b 0 × PLR 3 + b 1 × PLR 2 + b 2 × PLR + b 3 where b0, b1, b2, and b3 are the fitting coefficients listed in Table 8 , and 0.3 ≤ PLR ≤0.8. Fig. 9 shows the fluctuations in the groundwater source temperature (Tgw) during the 2022 air-conditioning season. Owing to the real-time variation in Tgw, the above model was fitted to ensure the accuracy of the results. The fitting accuracy was verified to be good, and the model was used. The fitting coefficients and R2 values are listed in Table 9 . 4.3 Pump simulation model The inverter pumps of the case system were operated for a long time to prevent errors caused by equipment aging. Historical data regression was used to establish the inverter pump model. Equation (27) was used to calculate the determination coefficient (R2), and Equation (28) was used to calculate the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) to determine the accuracy of the model. Equations (29)\u2013(31) are derived from the pump performance model. (27) R 2 = 1 − ∑ i = 1 j ( y p , i − y a , i ) 2 ∑ i = 1 j ( y \u203e − y a , i ) 2 (28) MAPE = 100 % i ∑ i = 1 j | y p , i − y a , i y a , i | where j is the number of samples, ya,i is the true value of sample i, and yp, i is the predicted value of sample i.

The actual power of the pump in 2022 was greater than 10 % of the rated power as historical data, as shown in Equations (32)\u2013(34) for the ACWP performance model and Equations (35)\u2013(37) for the SP performance model. The pump model error indicators listed in Table 10 can be used with high accuracy.

The MPC strategy is considered to be more energy efficient for the system when the system model accuracy is high, and the case system operated with the RBC strategy in 2022. Therefore, in this study, the proposed method was compared with the MPC and RBC methods in terms of algorithm performance and energy efficiency over the refrigeration period. Subsequently, owing to the similarity of the operating principles, it was only demonstrated during the heating hours that HMFC had a higher energy efficiency than RBC. The specific operating conditions are listed in Table 11 (n1 and n2 are introduced in Section 3.3). 5.2 Performance analysis of algorithms The method proposed uses the electric power of the device as the basis for the reward of the intelligence. Hence, the system cumulative power is used in this section as an index to analyze the convergence of the intelligences. Fig. 10 shows the convergence of the cumulative power of the three methods under different episodes in June as an example, where the horizontal axis represents the number of training sets, and the vertical axis represents the cumulative electric power of the month. In the first 500 episodes, the intelligences were highly exploratory in their interactions with the external environment; therefore, the trend in cumulative power did not always decrease during that interval. In particular, the episodes showed an increasing trend in the cumulative power in the interval of [10, 200], and the cumulative power of HMFC may have been higher than those of RBC and MPC during this phase. As the intelligent body deeply explored the environment under the greedy strategy, it selected the action corresponding to the point where the Q-value was larger. Subsequently, owing to the linear decay of the exploration factor, the intelligent body began to converge (the cumulative power of the month under the HMFC strategy floated within the interval of [19,813, 20,381] kW). The average training duration was 120 s. The cumulative power of HMFC after convergence was lower than those of RBC and MPC, indicating that HMFC can achieve system energy savings while ensuring fast convergence. However, owing to the preoptimization of Rfa, the heat pump system did not run for some time. This significantly increased the energy efficiency of HMFC. Hence, to analyze the performance of the HMFC algorithm further, the energy efficiency of the system was evaluated for each episode during the period when the heat pumps were running under the HMFC strategy (RBC was the control group), as listed in Table 12 . In the initial learning stage, MPC showed good performance because it calculated the results of all possible actions in advance and selected the optimal action, whereas HMFC was still in the exploratory learning stage; therefore, the energy saving was lower than that of MPC. Subsequently, with an increase in the number of training episodes, the intelligent body gradually explored and learned more deeply, understood the environment, and developed a more energy-saving global strategy. After 300 episodes of training, the intelligent body successfully explored the optimal policy. Because, at this point, the intelligent body could complete the task in the current environment and there was no significant room for subsequent improvement, the intelligent body tended to converge. The energy savings of HMFC were higher than those of the MPC after convergence, with a difference of 0.64 %. This was because HMFC used a lower CEB than MPC for some of the operating hours of the heat pump (see Section 5.3.1 for the specific energy efficiency analysis). Overall, under the constraint of expert knowledge, the proposed HMFC converged rapidly when the state space was large and continuous. The accumulated power of the system after convergence was lower than that of the MPC and RBC because end-of-system conditions were considered. In addition, it is believed that the results of MPC optimization are always optimal with high accuracy of the system model and that the energy savings of HMFC are similar to those of MPC during the operating time of the heat pump, which demonstrates the good control optimization performance of HMFC. 5.3 Energy saving analysis 5.3.1 Refrigeration working condition Fig. 11 illustrates the time-by-time CEB fluctuations under the HMFC and RBC approaches over 1554 h (the same CEB data were used for the RBC and MPC strategies). Overall, a low CEB value was obtained at the beginning of the cooling period. At some point, CEB = 0, and, during the transition from the early to middle phase, the enthalpy difference between the indoor and outdoor environments (Δh) gradually increased, leading to an increase in CEB at 421 h (July 1). A general trend of increasing CEB occurred when entering the middle of the refrigeration period. This continued until houtdoor was lowered at 8:00 a.m. on August 6 (925 h), resulting in a steep drop in CEB, which lasted until the end of the afternoon of August 10 at 2:00 p.m. (988 h). Then, the CEB gradually increased, and the subsequent fluctuation of the CEB followed the principle described above. This phenomenon indicates that the CEB under all three methods was directly affected by Δh. Fig. 12 shows the Rfa of the first floor of the building under the HMFC strategy during the cooling period (June 1 to September 19, for a total of 1554 h). A comparison with Fig. 10 reveals that the magnitude of the end Rfa was affected by the CEB and that the AHU maintained the Rfa,min operation in the larger CEB interval. Through the optimization of Rfa in the previous period, the number of heat pump start\u2013stop units (n) changed accordingly. Fig. 13 shows the distribution of n obtained using the HMFC methodology. At 1554 h, the heat pumps ran for a total of 767 h, with n = 0 predominating between June 1 and June 6 and between September 7 and September 19 because these were the early and late periods of the cooling period. The main reason for this phenomenon was that, at the beginning and the end of the cooling period, houtdoor was lower. Therefore, increasing Rfa made the fresh-air load (Qfa) increase and, thus, canceled out the cooling load required by indoor personnel, and the CEB decreased. Fig. 14 illustrates the fluctuations in Thps, facwp, and fsp under the three methods (HMFC used the setpoint obtained after convergence). Fig. 14(a) shows that the Thps fluctuations of HMFC and MPC were similar in some time periods because some of the CEB data optimized by HMFC were the same as those of MPC; therefore, similar results were observed in some cases. Fluctuations in the heat pump Thps were usually accompanied by changes in the pump frequency. Fig. 14(b) and (c) show the frequency fluctuation in steps of 1 h within 737 h, and the time clearly was not always continuous. The CEB demand decreased during the period when HMFC optimized Rfa, accompanied by the dynamic optimization of Thps. The pumping frequency fluctuated more in the HMFC method than in the MPC and RBC methods. First, considering the ACWP, when the CEB was not very small, facwp under the HMFC and MPC strategies remained at its lowest value (35 Hz). The energy savings in this phase mainly resulted from the reduction in Pacwp,a. The figure shows that the HMFC and MPC fluctuations were similar in part of the period because, at that time, the CEB was the same for all three methods. Second, if the SP device was only locally optimized, the optimized fsp could be unchanged or reduced. However, in this experiment, the fsp values of HMFC and MPC were higher than those of RBC. This is because different fsp values correspond to different condenser outlet flow rates and because of the change in the temperature of the water exiting the condenser of the heat pump, which in turn affects Php,a in terms of global optimization. Lowering Php,a by increasing fsp appropriately can be a viable option for achieving system energy savings. In addition, at the beginning of the refrigeration period, the fsp was concentrated at 35 Hz using the RBC method, whereas, under the HMFC and MPC methods, the fsp distribution was concentrated in the interval of [35, 38] and could reach as much as 43 Hz. The higher and more similar fluctuations in fsp under the HMFC and MPC methods compared with those under RBC had the same causes as those for Thps and facwp, which were also a result of global optimization. Subsequently, with an increase in CEB, a lower fsp could not satisfy the energy-saving demand of the system. The fsp value gradually increased, and the fsp fluctuation under the HMFC method was more evident in the middle and late parts of the cooling period, reaching as much as 47 Hz. Overall, when the CEB of the three methods are similar, HMFC and MPC have identical global optimization strategies. This phenomenon further suggests that the proposed HMFC method still has high optimal control performance in the absence of a system model. Fig. 15 compares the Ptotal values of the three methods over 1554 h. Through the global optimization of the system, the Ptotal under the MPC and HMFC methods was significantly lower than that of the RBC method. Moreover, compared with RBC, HMFC saved 24.26 % of energy during the cooling period, whereas the MPC saved 15.82 %. Furthermore, HMFC saved 10.03 % of energy compared with MPC. This was because the optimized Rfa caused the system to fail. Therefore, the energy efficiency of the system was significantly improved using the HMFC approach. 5.3.2 Heating condition From January 1 to March 15, for the first heating period, the system ran for 1036 h, and the heat pump ran for 1029 h. Owing to the characteristics of a large Δh in winter in the bitterly cold region, the system was operated following Rfa,min under the RBC and HMFC methods. For the heat pump unit, an appropriate reduction in Thps helped to reduce Php,a. However, an excessively low Thps would cause an increase in the electric power of other equipment and a reduction in indoor comfort. Therefore, identifying the most suitable Thps in real time was necessary. Fig. 16 shows the fluctuations in Thps, facwp, and fsp for 1029 h. The Thps was constant at 45 °C under the RBC method. Meanwhile, Thps under the HMFC method showed real-time dynamic fluctuations, where it could be as low as 40 °C and as high as 51 °C. Overall, Thps showed a decreasing trend, especially in the later part of the heating period (March 1 to March 15), when the decreasing trend was more evident, which was caused by the gradual increase in houtdoor. This gradually decreased the HEB demand, and, at this time, an appropriate reduction in Thps was conducive to a reduction in Ptotal. Therefore, Thps fluctuated at approximately 42 °C during the period. The fluctuations in facwp and fsp within 1029 h are shown in Fig. 16(b) and (c). Compared with the RBC method, the dynamic optimization of Thps in the HMFC method fluctuated significantly with the pump frequency. The facwp and fsp of both methods were concentrated in the [45, 46] and [42, 45] intervals. For HMFC, facwp and fsp could reach as much as 50 Hz and as little as 41 and 39 Hz, respectively. When the RBC method was used, facwp and fsp reached 47 and 46 Hz, respectively. Both were as low as 42 Hz because the strategy developed for HMFC stems from global optimization. In addition to the overall trend of the HMFC optimization strategy, a decrease in facwp was observed when Thps was elevated compared with the RBC method because the same HEB was used in both methods. The Ptotal fluctuations in the RBC and HMFC are shown in Fig. 17 . The Ptotal of the RBC method was significantly higher than that of the HMFC method, and the overall fluctuations of the two methods were similar. This was because the indoor HEB was higher when the air-conditioning system was operated at 7:00 a.m. on the following day. Hence, both methods had a higher Ptotal at this time. During the two time periods of 2:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. on March 7 and 2:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. on March 8, the PLR was less than 0.3. Therefore, Ptotal = 0. Subsequently, as houtdoor increased, the demand for the HEB decreased gradually, whereas the overall trend of Ptotal decreased. Compared with RBC, HMFC saved 7.38 % of its energy in the first heating period, and its energy-saving rate was lower than that in the cooling period. This was because Δh is higher in cold regions. Furthermore, Rfa was not well optimized, leading to a similar heat pump operation time and HEB for both methods. From November 1 to December 31, the system operated for 854 h during the second heating period. Consequently, the heat pump was operated for 816 h, and the first heating period was similar. The system ran at Rfa,min, and part of the fluctuation principle was not specifically described. Fig. 18 shows the fluctuation of the device parameters over 816 h. First, an optimization strategy for the HMFC method was developed. At the beginning of the heating period (November 1\u201326), the HEB was low. Hence, maintaining Thps = 40 °C could still satisfy the heating demand. During this time, the energy savings of the system mainly relied on the reduction in Php,a. Subsequently, in the middle and late stages of the heating period, the HEB gradually increased, and the initial system energy-saving strategy was no longer applicable. Therefore, Thps showed an overall increasing trend, and a fluctuation in Thps was evident, which could be as high as 52 °C and as low as 40 °C. Second, for the ACWP, when the HEB was similar, the minimal Thps determined facwp, and the resulting decrease in Δtgh was not conducive to reducing the system energy consumption. Relying on the structure of the original case system, controlling facwp in the interval Δtgh ∈ [3,8] (see Section 3.2 for a detailed analysis) was explored. This constraint led to a concentrated distribution of facwp under the HMFC approach in the interval of [36, 38] at the beginning of the heating period and a higher facwp within this phase compared with the RBC method. This phenomenon further verified that the system energy savings at the beginning of the second heating period were mainly achieved by reducing Php,a. As Δh increased, the HEB gradually increased. Moreover, extremely low Thps and high facwp values could not satisfy the demands for heat supply and energy savings. Therefore, after 319 h, both Thps and facwp under both methods increased significantly compared with those under RBC. A fluctuation of facwp under the HMFC method was evident owing to the dynamic optimization of Thps by HMFC. In addition, for the SPs, at the beginning of the second heating period, the SP was maintained at a lower frequency using the RBC and HMFC methods. In this study, the distribution was denser at fsp = 35 Hz when the HMFC method was used compared with when the RBC method was used. Considering that an appropriate increase in fsp reduces the actual electrical power of the heat pump while improving the heat exchange efficiency when the HEB is high, fsp was increased in both methods. The fsp under the HMFC and RBC methods reached maximums of 50 and 47 Hz and minimums of 41 and 42 Hz in the middle and late stages of the heating period, respectively. The HMFC fluctuations were more pronounced. This phenomenon resulted from the real-time dynamic optimization of the intelligence. Fig. 19 shows the fluctuations in Ptotal at 854 h. Overall, the fluctuations for both methods were similar. The value of Ptotal showed an overall increasing trend, with the Ptotal obtained using the RBC method being significantly higher than that obtained using the HMFC method. This disparity arose when using both methods, initially resulting in Ptotal = 0 at the beginning of the heating period, when the heat-pump system was not running. During the remaining 816 h, Ptotal was higher for both methods. Higher Ptotal values occurred daily from 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Compared with RBC, the energy-saving rate of HMFC in the second heating period was similar to that of the first heating period, at 9.38 %, which was still lower than that of the cooling period. 5.3.3 Analysis of annual results After the convergence of the algorithm, compared with RBC and MPC, the energy savings of HMFC were 24.26 % and 10.03 % in the cooling period, respectively, whereas in the heating period, the energy savings of the HMFC compared with the RBC were 7.38 % and 9.38 %, respectively. The energy savings of the two heating periods were similar, but they were still lower than those of the cooling period. This phenomenon was attributed to the characteristics of the large h in the bitter-cold region, which led to the same HEB for HMFC and RBC during the heating hours and the same running time of the heat pump. However, the optimization of Rfa during cooling hours led to a reduction in the system CEB during certain time periods and a reduction in the running time of the heat pump system, which increased the energy-saving effect of HMFC during cooling hours. This phenomenon indicated that optimizing Rfa could improve the energy efficiency of the control strategy by considering the end conditions. It was also concluded that, if the optimized control proposed were applied to regions with fewer winter hours under the same circumstances, the energy efficiency of the system would increase compared with that obtained in severely cold regions. Figs. 20 and 21 show the kernel density distributions of the annual fresh-air load (Qfa) versus CEB/HEB using the HMFC and RBC approaches, respectively. Regarding the overall distribution trend, the two methods had similar kernel density distributions when Qfa and CEB/HEB were high. However, when Qfa and CEB/HEB were in the intervals of [−1500, 500] and [−1000, 1500], respectively, a difference in the kernel density distribution was apparent. This indicated that, when h was large, the system could minimize the HEB only when it maintained the operation of Rfa,min to achieve energy savings. Fig. 22 shows the distribution of the system COP under the two controls. The average COP was higher during the cooling period than during the heating period for both methods. In this study, the increase in the system COP was greater during the cooling period than during the heating period for HMFC and RBC. First, for a specific analysis of the heating period, during the initial heating period, the distribution rates of the system COP of HMFC and RBC in the interval of [3.5, 4.7] were 70.7 % and 47.9 %, respectively. During the second heating period, the distribution rates in the interval of [4.25, 4.6] were 21.4 % and 0.12 %. In the second cooling period, 31.8 % of the COP under the HMFC method was distributed in the [4.75, 5.28] range, whereas that under the RBC was only 12.4 %. The average COP of the system under the HMFC method exceeded that of RBC. This demonstrates that the proposed method can significantly increase the COP of the system and improve the energy efficiency. 6 Engineering practice verification To ensure that the HMFC strategy was practical and robust, a one-day field test (Fig. 23 ) was conducted on a small office building in Shenyang City, China, from 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. on June 16, 2024. The test was conducted with a manual adjustment step of 1 h to observe the actual operation of field equipment under the guidance of the strategy. The building has five floors and a total floor area of 5074 m2. The HVAC system is similar to the aforementioned case system and, thus, is not described in detail. As shown in Fig. 24 , the local weather conditions on June 15, 2023, were similar to those on the day of the test. Therefore, the actual June 15, 2023, system operation data under RBC were used as the test control group. In the actual operation of a project, the times of occurrence of problems, such as equipment scheduling and algorithmic judgment errors, are unknown. Therefore, a manual control method was used in this experiment, and the building cold loads were used as real-time inputs to the algorithm. The algorithm calculated and analyzed the optimal operation based on a strategy that manually controls the operating parameters of field equipment. Then, the Thps generated by the algorithm at a certain moment was manually adjusted to 45 °C (as shown in Fig. 25 ) to observe whether the algorithm could recognize the error and correct it in time under the expert knowledge constraint (as described in Section 3.2). Fig. 26 shows the CEB fluctuations for the two strategies. The test results are shown in Fig. 27 , where the anomalous data point introduced at 5:00 p.m. in Fig. 27(a) could be recognized by the algorithm and corrected to 7 °C. This indicates that HMFC can recognize an anomalous data point under the constraints of expert knowledge, which improves the robustness of the algorithm. The engineering practice results show that the equipment could operate safely and stably during actual system operation. A comparative analysis of the energy consumption of each device is presented in Table 13 . On that day, the energy-saving strategy of HMFC was developed mainly through a reduction in Php,a, so that a reduction in Ptotal,a was realized. However, Pacwp,a was increased compared with that of RBC. This was because HMFC targets global rather than local optimization. The total power consumption of the system is shown in Fig. 28 . The energy saving of HMFC compared with RBC was 6.86 %. This indicates that HMFC can save energy in the system and that the strategy has practical feasibility. 7 Conclusion The proposed HMFC strategy combines DQN with L-BFGS-B under expert knowledge constraints, which improves the adaptability and expressiveness of the model in practical applications. In addition, the strategy optimizes the cooling and heating periods throughout the year while considering the system end conditions, and it simultaneously optimizes the main energy-consuming equipment inside the heat pump plant room and the end equipment, which improves the energy utilization of the HVAC system. HMFC was compared with RBC and MPC, and the results show the following. (1) HMFC can save energy in the system, with energy savings of 10.03 % and 24.26 % compared with MPC and RBC, respectively, during cooling hours and 7.38 % and 9.38 % compared with RBC in the first and second heating periods, respectively. (2) HMFC learns quickly without requiring historical data, performs well in practical office building applications, and has acceptable robustness and controllability. This strategy is feasible for buildings for which a large number of historical data are not available. (3) The end conditions of an HVAC system affect its overall energy consumption. Optimizing the end conditions while optimizing the internal equipment in a heat pump room is conducive to improving the energy utilization of the system and ensuring the comfort of people in the room. (4) The energy efficiency of a system can be increased by applying this strategy to buildings with small indoor\u2013outdoor enthalpy differences in winter. In addition, the theory can be extended to chiller rooms, which has certain development prospects. Future research efforts should focus on extending the HMFC strategy to the problem of a variable fresh-air ratio at the end of other types of HVAC system and further optimizing the operation strategy when HMFC is applied to chilled water plant rooms to improve the energy efficiency of HMFC in different HVAC environments.

        "dc:description": "At present, most optimization objectives of heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems focus on the local optimization of equipment during cooling hours, usually ignoring the importance of the end conditions. In addition, traditional control methods may not perform well in complex or dynamic systems. Therefore, in this study, a hybrid model-free control (HMFC) strategy was developed that combines deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with L-BFGS-B and expert knowledge to improve its ability to cope with complex system environments. This strategy was used to optimize the cooling and heating periods of a groundwater source heat pump system in a bitterly cold region of China throughout the year, considering the end-of-system conditions. L-BFGS-B optimized the fresh-air ratios for the end air-handling unit, whereas DRL achieved global optimization of the heat pump outlet temperature, air-conditioning water circulation pump frequency, and submersible-pump frequency. To verify the effectiveness of the strategy, a simulation platform was built based on actual data and device parameters, and the simulation results of HMFC and model predictive control (MPC) were output, compared, and analyzed with data of the system measured in 2022 under expert rule-based manual control (RBC). The results show that HMFC was 7.38 % and 9.38 % more energy efficient than RBC during heating hours, respectively. HMFC was 24.26 % more energy efficient than RBC and 10.03 % more energy efficient than MPC during cooling hours. Moreover, the distribution of the system coefficient of performance under the HMFC method was more concentrated in the higher range, indicating that the proposed HMFC can save energy savings. Thus, it is a feasible optimization scheme for buildings without a large number of historical data. Finally, the strategy was applied to a real engineering experimental analysis, and the engineering practice results show that the strategy is robust and practical.",
