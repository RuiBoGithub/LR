Lingkar Barat I Jambi 36129 Indonesia Managing the increment in energy demand can be solved by involving the demand side in order to increase energy consumption efficiency. However, increasing energy consumption efficiency tends to influence the user level of comfort. A research gap exists in the study of the energy efficiency and user comfort trade-off and in particular in providing low cost testbeds to study this phenomenon. This research discusses a low-cost testbed hardware design and the potential of the proposed Adaptive-Smart Energy Management Tool (A-SEM tool) to balance the level of comfort and energy consumption efficiency. We implement an adaptive energy limitation algorithm which uses up to 30 days historical data. The energy consumption is influenced by user behaviour which is monitored by the system sensors and energy limits are adapted for the provision of comfort. A smart home user is able to set the monthly energy consumption budget which determines the initial level of daily energy limitation. A-SEM performs real time monitoring and controlling, mainly considering shiftable loads evaluated at the testing stage. We test 3 possible conditions (possible modes of operation) and prove that our \u201cadaptive limit\u201d energy limitation algorithm is the most successful in balancing the level of comfort and energy efficiency. For a fixed budget and energy price, the proposed adaptive approach meets user level of comfort (our main priority) as well as achieving some energy savings. In our test the A-SEM tool provides user comfort, meets the monthly budget constraint and yet shows an energy saving of 2.62% which can increase or decrease depending on user behaviour. We present results showing energy saving levels, comfort levels and efficiency levels. The proposed A-SEM tool is low cost, implements an uncomplicated adaptive algorithm and therefore has the potential to be an affordable smart energy management system in future smart homes. Keywords Home energy management system HEMS Adaptive-A-SEM tool Smart home User comfort Demand side management 1 Introduction The needs for world electricity keeps increasing year by year by around 2.8% in average, reaching the total consumption of 25551.3 terawatt-hour in 2017 [1]. Instead of generating more energy, managing the consumption of energy is the way forward to lower the investment from costly generators as well as avoiding procrastination in capacity addition. It also means a reduction in gas emission. This trend is linked to demand side management which can be performed by engaging related technology in smart homes and smart energy buildings, demand side smart meters, sensors and other consumer interfaces for assisting energy consumption [2]. Some approaches to overcome the increasing demand by managing the energy consumption have been introduced in the literature. A common approach is to manage the demand based on time of use (ToU) such as the approach introduced by Minchala-Avila et al. [3] which involves a bidirectional communication between consumers and the distribution management system, where the distribution management system introduces the demand responsive program based on time of use which manages peak and off-peak time. Another approach based on ToU is also proposed by the work of F. Baig et al. [4], using a different platform i.e. a ZigBee based energy management centre which aims to control and schedule the loads. Additionally, besides implementing time of use based management, load prioritisation was also addressed by Suratsavade K. Korkua et al. [5]. He categorises household loads into four: uncontrollable, re-parameterizable, interruptible loads and shift-able loads. Similar to Baig et al. [4], he uses ZigBee based communication to control the loads. Besides implementing load scheduling or time of use, some other solutions implement the concept of load shedding. Ali et al. [6] work involves the utilisation of a microgrid in an attempt to overcome maximum demand, besides shifting the load based on time of use. However, this is quite in contrast with the work of Elkhorchani et al. [7] where, in order to overcome demand, he utilises power shedding combined with renewable energy to reduce carbon emission. The algorithm is set to meet a combination between fossil fuel and renewable energy resources, alongside battery storage for peak hours\u2019 consumption where charging will occur during off-peak hours. Di Santo et al. [8] combines the utilisation of distributed solar photovoltaic and energy storage. This approach aims to reduce consumer electricity cost by implementing an algorithm based on artificial intelligence [8]. Byun et al. [9] proposes a comprehensive smart energy distribution and management system that interacts between the distribution and the demand side, where monitoring patterns and control is performed. It monitors response times and provides energy savings that increase with the number of appliances under control. Energy savings are higher with pattern learning and can reach up to around 15%. They consider demanding appliances such as air conditioning. Chen et al. [10] use optimization approaches in their research, optimized power dispatch is used to meet load demand and there is a reduction in price for the user. Three different operation policies are outlined and price can be reduced up to 27.9% using one of these policies. Han et al. [11,12] propose a Zig-Bee based home energy control system design that provides intelligent services for users. They provide good detail of their design and implement the concept using a testbed. The emphasis here is on the provision of the technology at the customer side rather that optimization and performance. As we can see, there is a great variety in methods and approaches for energy management systems. For more detail on them the reader is referred to [13]. The research here clearly states that \u201cthe effectiveness of the methods in the existing literature can be difficult to compare due to diversity in modelling parameters, such as appliance models, timing parameters and objectives\u201d. Many of the solutions for electricity energy management to overcome the increasing demand are designed by implementing shifting loads based on time of use or scheduling, alongside with the implementation of sensor technology and communication to the smart metering equipment. There is also the implementation of energy shedding to switch the load based on energy price. The use of algorithms and machine learning have the potential to provide energy savings. Energy savings can significantly vary depending on appliances, methods, pricing model, etc. For more detail in energy savings the reader is referred to the review in [14]. Besides achieving efficiency, the consumers comfort, monthly budget and a practical low cost platform are also important factors to consider. This is especially true in emerging economies where home users have a monthly budget and would like to implement a low cost smart solution that balances energy savings with user comfort. Energy savings are desirable but using smart sensing for adapting the day to day use while maintaining comfort and sticking to the monthly budget constraint is the main goal. Therefore, our approach is novel in that it mainly addresses this balance between efficiency and comfort as well as providing a low cost sensing platform at the customer side that is able to recognize patterns and perform load shifting. This paper discusses system design, including the configuration and set-up of the components; functionality and algorithm testing to assess the system behaviour in several conditions, and finally discusses the potential ability to balance energy efficiency level and user comfort level. Adaptive-Smart Energy Management (A-SEM) tools novelty and practicality lies in the fact that A-SEM is a comprehensive tool that monitors consumption in real time, applies consumption limits to meet a monthly budget and uses sensors to recognize user activity to adapt consumption limits and in that way balances comfort and efficiency. 2 Background The A-SEM tool aims to manage the energy consumption by balancing the level of energy consumption efficiency and the level of users\u2019 comfort. These objectives can be reached by setting the limit of energy consumption, control the household energy consumption based on user preferences and user behaviour, and finally keep monitoring daily and monthly consumption of electricity to figure out the average energy consumption. As a way of controlling energy consumption, this work focus on shiftable home loads which operate temporarily. These type of loads have higher potential to deliver efficiency. The loads that fall in this category are for example cooking appliances, entertainment, laundering, charging devices, etc. From the assumption of daily electricity consumption in Table 1 , the user potentially spends 26.737 kWh of energy in a day, or £ 3.80, and this translates into £ 114 in 30 days. Since every day pattern will differ in practice, such as during a weekend or a day off, the implemented system takes user daily activity into consideration and self-updates the daily energy limitation to meet the monthly budget, therefore balancing energy saving, efficiency and comfort. 2.1 System design In general, the A-SEM tool consists of three main parts, i.e. (1) data collecting, (2) processing, and (3) controlling, as showed in Fig. 1 . Each part has its own specification described in this section. Each of the parts will be implemented using the relevant algorithms as described next. 2.2 Data collecting The purpose of data collecting is to aggregate the initial data such as the target monthly expenditure in units of currency (i.e. monthly budget). We use an LCD touchscreen to show basic information about monthly energy budget options. By performing this initial input, the system sets data such as a maximum daily consumption in units of energy (kWh) and total energy price to be spent. For the purpose of data collection, some sensors will be deployed. For electric current reading purposes, current sensors are used which read current flow through each channel. This data is then used by a processor to calculate energy consumption in real time and to perform some comparisons in order to ensure that the energy consumption fulfils the limitation. Another aim of the A-SEM tool is to sense human presence by using a motion sensor which aims to maintain user comfort and energy efficiency in the application. This is of benefit when the daily energy consumption reaches the limit, but the user still intends to use the energy for a specific purpose for a short amount of time. The motion sensor will trigger the system and allow the user to proceed. The A-SEM tool will record this condition to affect the further daily energy limitation. The main purpose in such scenario is to increase the level of comfort of the users. 2.3 Data processing The second part of the A-SEM tool is data processing. All embedded sensors and controllers, as well as an LCD module and an Atmel based microcontroller board are used. The Atmel microcontroller is an 8-bit microcontroller with a 10 bits ADC converter included [15]. We use an Arduino Mega 2560 board with an ATMega 2560 microcontroller with sufficient I/O digital and analog ports and communication ports. The Arduino board is an opensource platform which is relatively low-cost compared to other manufactured microcontroller boards. In this data processing part, some algorithms are applied to execute functions to set the user preferences and monthly electricity expenditure target. This data lets the system operate according to user needs, calculating energy consumption with real-time monitoring and examining the energy efficiency. For convenience, an algorithm to adapt the energy consumption according to user behaviour is developed in this data processing part. 2.4 Controlling To implement the algorithm set in the microcontroller unit, we utilise an actuator module. This is a relay module with the ability to perform switching when triggered from the controller. 2.5 Programming algorithm The A-SEM tool is programmed to manage the energy consumption in a practical manner by limiting the daily consumption as the users initially set up their budget. However, the motion sensor will help the users to remain using the electricity even in the event of reaching the daily limitation of energy consumption. This activity will be recorded by the system and then utilised in the data part to maintain the daily energy consumption limit in the future. Therefore, the adaptive algorithm will maintain energy efficiency alongside balancing the user convenience in practice, achieving an efficiency and comfort trade off. 3 Material and method 3.1 Methodology A-SEM tool consist of various components for the purposes of controlling, measuring electric current, detecting the presence or users, calculating and recognising active time and switching on and off the loads. Those are (1) TA12-100 current sensor, (2) Pyroelectric Infra-Red (PIR) sensor, (3) Real Time Clock (RTC) module, (4) Liquid Crystal Display, and (5) Relays and terminal connections. 3.2 TA12-100 current sensor In the A-SEM testbed, three TA12-100 current sensors are utilised and follow the connections revealed in Fig. 2 . 3.3 PIR sensor In adaptive mode, human presence could be used as a trigger to allow the A-SEM tool to keep switching on the channel even if the energy consumption has exceeded the daily limit as the system maintains comfort, self-updates future daily targets and meets the monthly budget. The connection diagram of PIR sensor is shown in Fig. 3 , which consist of power input of 5 V DC, ground connection (GND) and sensor output pin. The output pin of the PIR sensor will provide a high or low level signal depending if there is a moving IR source or not [17]. The output pin from the PIR sensor is connected to a digital pin in the microcontroller or Arduino board. 3.4 RTC module The RTC module is an accurate Real Time Clock module to keep accurate timing of events. A simple schematic of the RTC module in our testbed is revealed in Fig. 4 . There is an SCL pin which is a Serial Clock Input/output pin and SDA (Serial Data Input/Output) as an I2C serial interface. Besides that, 5 V DC allows this module to work with the Arduino board. 3.5 LCD display The 2.8-inch TFT LCD shows the information of recent energy consumption; daily limitation; monthly consumption and consumption status including if the limit has been exceeded or not. This is an Arduino shield LCD that needs no extra cable for connecting to the Arduino board. Fig. 5 shows the back-side view of the connection diagram of the LCD shield to the Arduino Mega 2560. This LCD incorporates a touch screen film on its surface and an SD-card slot for further data storage with the same functionality as a data logger shield for the Arduino board. These features will be available by installing the required library to the Arduino IDE and declaring it in the listing code [19]. The communication type of this LCD is ICSP (In-Circuit Serial Programming), which is a modification of ISP (In-System Programming) technique. A 6-pins ICSP port consists of ICSP SCLK, MISO, MOSI, VCC (5 V), GND, and RESET. The SCLK pin is the hardware SPI clock, MISO is a hardware master-in-slave-out, and MOSI is an SPI pin for master-out-slave-in function. The RESET pin re-starts the system [19]. The ICSP SCLK, MOSI, MISO, VCC, and GND pins are used together with the touch screen and the SD-card slot. To activate the touchscreen, STMPE610 Resistive Touch CS pin should be triggered HIGH, which is connected to digital pin 8 on the Arduino board. This is the same as using the SD card function by activating SD card CS pin linked to digital pin 4 of the Arduino board. 3.6 Relays and terminal connections The A-SEM tool incorporates two main relays for 2 main channels (priority 1 and 2 channels), and 8 channel relays for lighting. This work mainly focus on the shiftable loads on channel 2. It is a 5 V relay module, driven by a EL817 photoelectric coupler with anti-interference and low power ability. This IC provides the controlling functionality and uses Arduino board by sending a logic signal, HIGH or LOW. The relays could drive the current up to 10 A at 240 V AC. A diagram of A-SEM tool relays module is depicted in Fig. 6 . This system utilises digital pin 26 and 28 for the two main channels, and digital pin 30, 32, \u2026, 44 for the 8-lighting channels. Pin C in the relays (common) is connected in series configuration with other relays, and NO (normally open) pin to the devices which will be controlled by the A-SEM tool. 3.7 Algorithm and programming 3.7.1 Algorithm To ease the discussion, the A-SEM tool algorithm is shown in Fig. 7 . It consists of 3 main blocks, which are labelled in the top right corner of each block. Block 1 is the initialisation step, block 2 is a conversion step, block 3 is an ADAPTIVE mode loop. To begin with, the operation of the A-SEM tool is started by switching on the system by connecting the equipment to the 230 V AC source. The initialisation process starts activating some registers, port settings or communication settings to the RTC module, sensor modules, the LCD module including SD-card, and port settings for relay status and serial communication port. This process is continued by a manual input process entering an option for monthly budget provided in the screen. In adaptive mode, the system immediately converts the initial value of monthly budget in GBP to value of energy in kWh (block 2), as well as the value of daily limitation, and finally shows the result in the LCD. The next process reads the ADC values for current sensors and does conversions for load power in watts and energy in Wh. This process is labelled as the first step of the block 3 loop. The conversion result of this first step in block 3 loop is then shown on the LCD. This is followed by a decision step to indicate whether the current day has come to an end (i.e. the day is changing). If the day is changing, we feed the value of energy consumption to the monthly consumption variable before resetting, recalculate the daily limitation value and show it on the LCD. In contrast, if it remains in the same day, we leap in the process to the next step for checking if the energy consumption exceeds the daily limitation or not. If the condition is \u2018NO\u2019, we go to the first step of the loop in block 3. If it is \u2018YES\u2019, we have exceeded the daily limitation consumption, however we check the status of the PIR sensor that will indicate the presence of user movement around the system by a HIGH reading in the sensor output pin. This HIGH logic feedback sensor reading causes the code to start looping again from the beginning of this block 3. As a result, the electricity current flowing to the terminal is maintained and hence user comfort. Contrarily, when the sensor feedback is \u2018LOW\u2019, as a condition of no user activity around the system, the relay blocks the current to the terminal. Finally, the looping process in block 3 is continued by using the recent setting of relay status and daily limitation value. 3.7.2 Programming In this work, the Arduino platform programming language for Arduino IDE compiler is utilised as it is cored to C computer programming language. In a nut shell, this procedural language syntax maps the human-readable code to machine instructions, which is processed by a C compiler. In some cases, C programming language is written overly cryptic. This causes the code to be relatively hard to understand by beginner users, which drove the Arduino team to develop some Arduino libraries to ease the task [20]. 4 Results and discussion This section presents the results of the A-SEM tool, as well as the algorithm ability to operate in various conditions (possible modes of operation) for monitoring and controlling the energy consumption. The result section focus on algorithm testing, which is assessed in three conditions. We elaborate further on this on the discussion session. 4.1 Results The system has been successfully built up, as it is shown in Fig. 8 . The A-SEM testbed and tool consist of: 1.

Power supply 230 V AC to 5 V DC. 4.2 Measurement testing This testing examines the ability of the equipment to gather daily energy consumption which becomes the total energy consumption after a certain period, i.e. 30 days of measurement. Fig. 9 shows the measurement result of total energy consumption for a duration of 30 days. In this testing, Fig. 9, measurement is conducted to compare energy consumption in three conditions. These conditions represent possible modes of operation, with the \u201cadaptive limit\u201d one being the most advantageous to balance efficiency and comfort. The conditions are: (1) \u201cnormal\u201d condition in black line, without limitation, (2) \u201cstick to limit\u201d condition in red line, with limitation level in purple line, and (3) \u201cadaptive limit\u201d in blue line with adaptive limitation in green line. The testing starts with inputting our monthly energy budget. After inserting this number, a daily limitation figure will be estimated by the system. This number becomes the maximum number of daily consumption in the \u201cstick to limit\u201d condition. In contrast, the limitation number will be ignored in normal condition. In adaptive mode, the limitation will be evaluated every day and becomes the reference for the next day limitation. This means the adaptive energy limitation level is not stable every day and affects the daily consumption. It can be seen how the blue line in Fig. 9 has relative increases due to energy limitation increases. 4.3 Discussion To date there is scarce research in balancing energy efficiency and comfort. An approach in maintaining energy saving while still considering user comfort was previously discussed in [21] to implement an intelligent lighting control strategy. This was achieved by dimming the light based on user preferences with active sensing in combination with external light sources or daylight harvesting. The testing was conducted for several iterations to get the most effective combination of the trade-off parameter which was identified by a so called γ value. It is shown that an increased level of user comfort inevitably incurs increased energy cost This clearly highlights the trade-off between comfort and cost. This topic requires more research attention and it has been the focus of our research. Our adaptation algorithm is mainly built up by recognising the daily average of energy consumption which maintains up to 30 days historical data. This can be formulated by Eq. (1). When the equipment aims to determine the next day limitation (ELn), the value of the limitation today (ELn-1) is multiplied by the number of days (n). The number of days variable represents how many days we have been using this equipment during the current month, so 30 is the maximum number. This multiplication value is then added to the value of the energy consumption today (ECn-1) or we can call this calculation the total energy consumption in n days plus 1. The calculation result is then divided by the number of days (n) plus 1. We call this final calculation result the average energy consumption in the last 31 days. Finally, tomorrows daily energy limitation, ELn, is set. (1) EL n = ( E L n - 1 × n ) + EC n - 1 m where ELn is the energy limitation in day n. ELn−1 is the energy limitation in day n − 1. ECn−1 is the energy consumption in day n − 1. n represents the number of days. m = n + 1 with n maximum value equal 30. We performed some testing to know if the approach is valid in balancing the energy efficiency and comfort level, by analysing the same chart in Fig. 9. By summing up the total energy consumption for each condition, we found out that the lowest energy consumption is that implemented by the \u201cstick to limit\u201d algorithm. By implementing this algorithm, the user monthly budget is met. However, this is a rigid approach and disturbs user habits, especially in the weekend (day 7, 14, 21, and 28), where they used to consume up to 32 kWh and this was capped to 25 kWh by this algorithm. This is in contrast with the energy consumption implemented by using \u201cadaptive limit\u201d energy consumption. The user still achieves energy savings while getting slightly flexible energy limitation every day. This is thanks to the adaptive mode which recognises user habits. This results in increased level of comfort which is our main objective. To figure out the energy saving, this can be analysed by comparing the sum up of these three measurement conditions. Energy saving in this scope is described as the differences between normal energy consumption (En) and energy consumption when implementing \u201cadaptive limit\u201d mode (Em), shown in Fig. 10 . Estimation of energy saving can be obtained by the following equation [14]: (2) Energy s a v i n g s % = 1 - ∑ 1 30 E m ∑ 1 30 E n × 100 % Energy s a v i n g s ( % ) = 1 - 782.23 803.28 100 % = 2.62 % Therefore, in our test the implementation of the \u201cadaptive limit\u201d algorithm could save around 2.62% of energy. This number can increase or decrease depending on user habits and patterns which are recognised by the A-SEM tool. The level of comfort is identified as the difference between the energy consumption in adaptive mode (Em), showed as the blue line, and the stick energy limitation (EL), showed as the purple line, Fig. 10. While the energy efficiency level is described as the differences between normal energy consumption (En) and energy consumption which implementing adaptive mode (Em). Estimation of comfort level: (3) Comfort l e v e l = ( ∑ 1 30 E m - ∑ 1 30 E L ) ( ∑ 1 30 E n - ∑ 1 30 E L ) Comfort l e v e l = ( 782.23 - 768.16 ) ( 803.28 - 768.16 ) = 0.4 Estimation of efficiency level: (4) Efficiency l e v e l = ( ∑ 1 30 E n - ∑ 1 30 E m ) ( ∑ 1 30 E n - ∑ 1 30 E L ) Efficiency l e v e l = ( 803.28 - 782.23 ) ( 803.28 - 768.16 ) = 0.6 It can be said that, the higher level of comfort (i.e. the user activity is detected, and the user consumes more energy), the lower the level of efficiency and vice versa. For instance, imagine we strictly set the system to switch off the terminal if the daily energy limit has been reached. If the condition happened in the unfortunate situation when users are cooking, they have to stop cooking. This inconvenience significantly reduces the level of comfort to satisfy efficiency. In contrast, when the users aim to get full satisfaction, using electricity for all appliances, without any energy limitation, no energy efficiency is made. The cooking example is convenient to illustrate the concept but the flexibility in the efficiency-comfort trade-off is really provided by thinking about the variety of shiftable loads in a smart home as illustrated in Table 1. The linearity of the efficiency and comfort trade off is also discussed in [21]. Finally, the result revealed by Fig. 9 shows the potential for the A-SEM testbed to balance the energy consumption efficiency and user comfort. Moreover, this is developed as a low-cost testbed using a relatively simple adaptive algorithm which implements the calculation of averaging up to the last 30 days historical data to determine the next day limitation. The A-SEM testbed proves the concept of smart metering and energy management when we have the option of shifting loads in a smart home context. 5 Conclusion This research addresses the existing gap in the trade off between energy efficiency and user comfort and in particular the provision of low cost platforms to study this phenomenon. The design of a low-cost Arduino based adaptive smart home energy management system has been successfully produced and built up with a focus on managing home shiftable loads. By utilising a TA12-100 current sensor and a TFT LCD touchscreen the basic functionality of meter reading shows the recent load status in watts and recent energy consumption both in unit of energy and currency. By performing an initial setup and manually inputting the value of a monthly budget into the TFT LCD touchscreen, the user is able to target the electricity consumption in a month and the daily limitation of electricity consumption will be set. To assist the user, the adaptation algorithm balances the energy consumption efficiency level and the level of user comfort. This algorithm is developed with the ability to limit the daily energy consumption yet adapt the energy limitation based on user behaviour as monitored by daily average energy consumption and a motion sensor. The algorithm take into account up to 30 days historical data. The proposed adaptive energy limitation algorithm shows the potential to balance the level of comfort and energy consumption efficiency and to achieve some energy savings in the process. We have proved this by comparing energy consumption in normal condition, energy limitation in stick condition and the energy consumption when implementing the adaptive algorithm. The higher the level of comfort, the lower level of efficiency and vice versa. In our test the A-SEM tool shows an energy saving ability of about 2.62% but this can increase or decrease depending on user behaviour.

        "dc:description": "Managing the increment in energy demand can be solved by involving the demand side in order to increase energy consumption efficiency. However, increasing energy consumption efficiency tends to influence the user level of comfort. A research gap exists in the study of the energy efficiency and user comfort trade-off and in particular in providing low cost testbeds to study this phenomenon. This research discusses a low-cost testbed hardware design and the potential of the proposed Adaptive-Smart Energy Management Tool (A-SEM tool) to balance the level of comfort and energy consumption efficiency. We implement an adaptive energy limitation algorithm which uses up to 30 days historical data. The energy consumption is influenced by user behaviour which is monitored by the system sensors and energy limits are adapted for the provision of comfort. A smart home user is able to set the monthly energy consumption budget which determines the initial level of daily energy limitation. A-SEM performs real time monitoring and controlling, mainly considering shiftable loads evaluated at the testing stage. We test 3 possible conditions (possible modes of operation) and prove that our \u201cadaptive limit\u201d energy limitation algorithm is the most successful in balancing the level of comfort and energy efficiency. For a fixed budget and energy price, the proposed adaptive approach meets user level of comfort (our main priority) as well as achieving some energy savings. In our test the A-SEM tool provides user comfort, meets the monthly budget constraint and yet shows an energy saving of 2.62% which can increase or decrease depending on user behaviour. We present results showing energy saving levels, comfort levels and efficiency levels. The proposed A-SEM tool is low cost, implements an uncomplicated adaptive algorithm and therefore has the potential to be an affordable smart energy management system in future smart homes.",
