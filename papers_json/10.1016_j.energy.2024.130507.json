Qingdao University of Technology No.777 Jialingjiang Road Huangdao District Qingdao City Shandong Province China Handling editor: X Zhao This study assessed thermal comfort and energy consumption in indoor environments controlled by air or operative temperature. Reading rooms in a library were divided into several zones based on the distribution of operative temperature. Using air temperature of the inner zone in thermostat control yielded the lowest energy consumption but the poorest thermal comfort level. Conversely, using operative temperature of the least favorable exterior zone resulted in higher energy consumption and comfort levels. The suggested optimal control based on switching boundary temperature minimized energy consumption while satisfying the thermal comfort requirement. The switching boundary temperature range on the top floor is 0.7 °C lower than on the middle floor due to the influence of the roof. The thermostat control modes had similar effects on the east and west reading rooms. The switching boundary temperature ranges of north room was 2.0 °C higher than those of the south room. Zoning control using air temperature control in the inner zone and operative temperature control in the exterior zone was recommended as a much simple mode to keep thermal comfort with low energy use. This study provides insights about the use of operative temperature in zoning thermostat control and theoretical guidance for practical implementation.

In light of China's announced goal of \u201cCarbon peak and carbon neutrality\u201d, building energy saving has become a hot theme in the related study fields. Statistics show that the energy consumption of buildings accounts for about 40 % of the total energy consumption globally [2,3]. In China, the share of building energy consumption is also increasing, reaching to 46.5 % of the total energy use [4]. Among the building energy consumption, the HVAC (heating, ventilating and air conditioning) systems' energy consumption accounts for about 30\u201340 % [1]. In modern buildings, glass curtain walls and envelope structures with high window-wall ratio are widely adopted for aesthetic and daylighting purposes, which directly contribute to the high HVAC energy consumption of public buildings, and also affect the thermal comfort of indoor occupants [5,6]. The surface and the transmitted solar radiation of curtain walls and external windows influence the mean radiant temperature. The mean radiant temperature is an important factor affecting thermal comfort, which has been extensively studied by many scholars [7\u20139]. In HVAC systems, the indoor air temperature is the main factor that determines the thermal environment parameters, and the system operation and regulation are based on the set point of indoor air temperature [10]. However, the effect of thermal radiation on human thermal comfort has been well established by early studies such as Hardy [7] and Gagge [8]. When there are large differences between the indoor air temperature and the radiant surface temperatures in a space, the air temperature control may not satisfy the thermal comfort needs, and may also lead to energy waste due to excessive cooling or heating [11]. Gagge [12] proposed the concept of operative temperature, which integrates the effects of mean radiant temperature and air temperature on thermal comfort. The operative temperature is one of the indoor thermal comfort evaluation indexes adopted in international standards [13,14]. The defining equation for the operative temperature is as follows [13,14]: (1) t o p = h c t a + h r t r h c + h r Let F = h c h c + h r , equation (1) can be expressed as: (2) t o p = F t a + ( 1 − F ) t r where: t op is the operative temperature (°C); t a is the indoor air temperature of the wall surface (°C); t r is the mean radiant temperature (°C); h c is the convective heat transfer coefficient of the human body surface (W/(m2⋅K)); h r is the radiative heat transfer coefficient of the human body surface based on the linear temperature difference (W/(m2⋅K)), respectively. When the air velocity increases, h c also increases, and thus the influence of air temperature weight F will increase. In most office environments, the air velocity is lower than 0.2 m/s, and h r and h c are of the comparable magnitude with F equaling to 0.5. In such case, (1) and (2) can be simplified to: (3) t o p = 0.5 ( t a + t r ) Previous studies have investigated the effects of operative temperature control and air temperature control [15,16] on thermal comfort and system energy consumption. Julien et al. [17] compared the building energy consumption under the two control methods through simulation and found that the heating energy consumption increased by 18.7 % when operative temperature control was used. Niu et al. [18] obtained similar conclusions and suggested exploring the impact of using operative temperature control on building energy consumption for different buildings. Yang et al. [19] examined the impact of radiant temperature on thermal comfort, and found that a radiant temperature of 26.2 °C would provide a thermally comfortable condition for human occupants. Turhan [20] compared the energy consumption and indoor thermal comfort of an air conditioning system under two control modes, and reported that operative temperature control slightly increased the energy consumption but improved the comfort level. Borier et al. [21] discovered that controlling the indoor thermal environment with operative temperatures of different regions could result in either a 14.6 % increase or a 9.4 % decrease in energy consumption compared with air temperature control. Jain et al. [22] simulated and evaluated the thermal comfort and energy consumption of two control modes for summer offices in New Delhi, India, and demonstrated that operative temperature control satisfied the thermal comfort needs, but raised the cooling energy consumption by 14\u201319 %. Kontes et al. [23] compared the effects of two temperature controls on thermal comfort for two different buildings and concluded that air temperature controls cannot structurally and systematically represent and control the thermal comfort of a building. Maivel et al. [24] experimentally investigated the heat loss of three heating installations in the Nordic climate, and concluded that the heat supply and loss were different when controlling the heating units with operative temperatures of different zones. Wang et al. [25,26] studied the thermal comfort and energy consumption of different HVAC units under three climatic conditions and two control methods, and found that thermal comfort could be improved when convective air handling units were operated with operative temperature control, while energy consumption increased accordingly. They also found that the energy consumption could be reduced by 3∼8 % when radiant floors were operated with operative temperature control, while thermal comfort decreased slightly compared to air temperature control. Their study suggested that with large window-to-wall ratio, operative temperature control should be used to meet the thermal comfort needs of the room, while the energy consumption increased by about 3∼6 %. Olesen et al. [27,28] came to the same conclusion and analyzed the effect of the characteristics of the operative temperature sensor itself in conjunction with experiments. Most of the studies have shown that indoor thermal comfort and energy use can be different when operative temperature was used in control, and most of them reported improved thermal comfort combined with increased energy use for the convective HVAC units, while for the radiant unit energy saving could be achieved. Borier et al. [21] and Maivel et al. [24] reported the difference in energy consumption when operative temperature of different zones was used in control. Currently, most studies about the thermostat control involving operative temperature used the uniform value of the studied room or space. Maivel et al. [24] reported that the energy use could be different when operative temperatures of different zones were used in control. The effect of uneven distribution of operative temperature should be considered. Besides, the applicability of air or operative temperature based on zoning were not reported in details yet. In addition, most studies found that the use of operative temperature in thermostat control caused increase of energy use. One reason is that the thermal comfort condition of the studied rooms is not satisfying when using air temperature in thermostat control. When the operative temperature is used in control, the thermal comfort is improved and lead to increase in energy use. How to keep the increase of energy use to a lower level while improving thermal comfort? This question should also be explored. Existing researches on air temperature or operative temperature control are mostly based on small rooms or buildings, and the zoning effect on thermostat control is seldom considered. For modern public buildings, large rooms with glass curtain walls are quite common. This brings impact on the distribution of air temperature and operative temperature in different zones, which can affect thermal comfort. Under this situation, the thermostat control to keep thermal comfort with low energy increment should be considered. Therefore, this paper focuses on the performance of thermostat control based on air and operating temperatures, taking into account regional differences in large complex spaces. The effect of different zoning thermostat controls on indoor thermal comfort and energy consumption would be studied. The thermostat control modes satisfying the thermal comfort needs with lower energy increment would also be discussed. 2 Model In this paper, an actual public building (a university library) was selected as the case building. The thermostat control modes based on air and operative temperature of different zones were studied for the reading rooms in the library. The effects of location factors such as floor and orientation were considered. By numerical simulation, the performance of different control modes would be compare. 2.1 Building modeling The university library building is shown in Fig. 1 . The library, which was recently built and opened in September 2021, is a large modern public building. The building envelope has a large number of glass curtain wall structures for natural lighting and aesthetics, which is typical characteristics of large modern buildings. The building is located in Qingdao, a city located in a cold climate region. The typical annual outdoor temperature ranges from −11.1 to 34 °C. The local buildings have both cooling and heating needs during summer and winter. The library is installed with centralized air-conditioning system. The building has a floor area about 6000 m2 and eight floors above ground for the main part. It has only four floors on the west and east side-parts. Air source heat pump units are used as the building's heating and cooling plants, which are installed on the roof. The building model is established by the DesignBuilder (version 6.1) software, and the model is shown in Fig. 2 . DesignBuilder is a simulation software based on EnergyPlus [29], which has building material data as well as different kinds of air-conditioning system settings. The software can simulate energy consumption according to user-defined parameters such as indoor and outdoor temperatures, ventilating, and heating/cooling systems. In the model, the building materials and thermal parameters of the envelope were set according to the actual library, as shown in Table 1 . The thermal characters of the envelope meet the requirements of the thermal performance limits of public building in cold regions of China [30]. The typical reading rooms with different orientations of east, west, south and north were simulated. The west facing reading rooms on the second floor (middle floor) and the fourth floor (top floor) were compared. The east/west facing reading room occupies about 1260 m2, while the south/north facing reading room is about 384 m2. The location of the reading room for each orientation is shown in Fig. 3 . 2.2 Condition setting The cooling period was determined according to the actual operation time of the air-conditioning system, which is from June 15 to September 30, a total of 108 days. The air source heat pump in the model was set according to the actual parameters with a rated cooling capacity of 130 kW and an input electricity power of 40.1 kW for cooling. Based on the data of the heat pump from the manufacturer, the relationship between the EER (Energy Efficiency Ratios) of the heat pump and the outdoor temperature (t, °C) was obtained, as shown in equation (4): (4) E E R = 10.48 − 0.32 t + 0.003 t 2 The actual use of the rooms and operation of the air-conditioning system have been investigated in previous works. The reading rooms are equipped with fan coil units combined with fresh air systems. The fresh air handling units are the type of total heat recovery with designated heat recovery efficiency of 60 %. The designed supply volume of fresh air is 30 m3/(h· person) [31]. Both the fan-coils and fresh air units are operated with constant air volume. The rooms in use during the opening hours include the reading rooms, data collection areas, and service areas. The indoor thermal environment is controlled according to the return air temperature of fan-coils in the center of rooms. The indoor air temperature is set to 26 °C during cooling. The operation time of the air conditioning system is the same as the working hours of the reading rooms, which is from 8:00 to 18:00 during daytime. In the model, the air-conditioning units and system were set according to the information. The number of occupants and parameters of equipment were set according to the Calculation Standard for Green Performance of Civil Buildings (JGJ/T449-2018) [32]. The occupant density was 8 m2/person, and the heat dissipation was 108 W/person. The equipment energy density was 15 W/m2, the lighting energy density was 9 W/m2. In the library, the exterior windows are fitted with louvered sun-shades. The angle of the louvers can be adjusted by the users to avoid uncomfortable sunlight causing glaring. Previous investigation in the reading rooms found that users usually adjust the louver to block the sunlight when the direct solar radiation was higher than 200\u2013250 W/m2 in summer. In the model, internal shading for windows was set, which was activated when the solar radiation exceeded 200 W/m2. The meteorological parameters used in the model are the time-by-time data of a typical meteorological year in Qingdao in DesignBuilder software, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, solar radiation, etc. The outdoor temperature fluctuates in the range of 10.0\u201334.0 °C during the cooling season. 3 Field test model validation 3.1 Field test A field test was conducted on the west-facing reading room on the second floor of the library on August 26, 2022. The testing included indoor and outdoor temperature and humidity, surface temperatures of the envelope, and air velocity of the occupied zone. The specific locations of the testing points and the positions of the supply and return air outlets and layout of the reading room are shown in Fig. 4 . The location of testing points and parameters of testing instruments are shown in Table 2 . The surface temperatures of the walls and floor were measured using the TR-52i temperature self-recorded devices. For the ceiling surface temperature, the infrared temperature measurement device (TESTO-830-S1 infrared thermometer,±2 °C) was used., which was manually operated. The ceiling surface temperature of four points were measured, which corresponded to the location of the four indoor air and humidity testing points. The change of ceiling surface temperature is usually much slower. Therefore, the ceiling surface temperature was measured every 10 min. Based on the surface temperatures, the mean radiant temperature is calculated by equation (5) [33]: (5) t r = ∑ j = 1 k ( F j t j ) where: t j is the temperature (°C) of the jth surface of the surroundings; F j is the angular coefficient of the jth surface of the surroundings. In this case, the angular coefficient is a coefficient that reflects the geometrical shape and positional relationship between different surfaces. The indoor and outdoor temperature and relative humidity were measured by the COS-03 temperature and humidity sensors, which are self-recorded. The air velocity was measured by the KANOMAX anemometer. The detailed information and location of the testing devices are shown in Table 2. 3.2 Model validation Based on the measured data of outdoor temperature and relative humidity, the outdoor parameters of the testing day were set in DesignBuilder, and the data of the indoor air temperature and envelope surface temperature of the reading room on the testing day were calculated in the model. The outdoor temperature, relative humidity, and solar radiation intensity for the test days are shown in Figs. 5 and 6 . The outdoor air temperature fluctuated between 17.1 and 29.6 °C on the testing day. The relative humidity was in the range of 51.5 and 99.6 %. The maximum value of solar radiation intensity (from the database of DesignBuilder) on the test day was 754 W/m2, which occurred at 13:00. The air conditioning system was also set in the building model, and the energy consumption was obtained. The accuracy of model was analyzed by comparing with the measured data. 3.2.1 Validation of the indoor thermal model The comparison of the simulated results with the measured data is shown in Fig. 7 . The variation trends of the measured and simulated surface temperatures are almost the same. The change of the surface temperature is the largest for the window; for the other envelope surfaces, the surface temperatures are relatively stable. Compared with the simulated values, the measured values were more stable. The average difference between the simulated and measured envelope surface temperatures is less than 2 °C. Considering the difference in solar radiation intensity between the simulation software and the actual values (which were not measured), the simulation results are relatively accurate. Due to the simulated air temperature distribution in each zone of the reading room were compared with the measured data, which are shown in Fig. 8 . In the measured data, the air temperature in testing point No.3 was the highest, and the air temperature in point No.1 was the lowest, while the air temperatures in point No. 2 and No. 4 were basically the same. The variation trends of the measured and simulated data were consistent, and the air temperature differences between the measured and simulated data at testing point 1, 2, 3 and 4 were 0.2 °C, 0.1 °C, 0.3 °C and 0.1 °C, respectively. The average difference between the simulated and measured air temperatures in each zone was less than 0.5 °C. As shown in Fig. 8, during summer cooling, the supply air temperature must be lower than 26 °C. Some of the measuring points were set near the lower area of the supply air outlets. Besides, the cooling load is not distributed evenly in the reading room. The fan coils are the same type and the supply air temperature are the same too. Therefore, both in the test and simulation, the temperatures in different zones are different, and in some the zones are lower than 26 °C. This leads to the uneven distribution of air temperature in space. 3.2.2 Validation of the energy consumption model The library itself is equipped with an energy monitoring data platform to monitor the energy consumption (electric energy) of the air source heat pumps and circulation water pumps. Using the energy monitoring platform, the total energy consumption data of the air-conditioning system of the testing day was obtained, which was used for the validation of the energy model. The hourly power consumption (including the power consumption of the air source heat pumps and the pumps) of the air conditioning system was compared with the hourly power consumption of the whole building obtained from the simulation, and the results are shown in Fig. 9 . The fan coils and fresh air systems are operating with constant volume during the working hours, and the fan energy consumption are the same in all the thermostat controls. Therefore, the fan energy consumption is not considered in the statistic of total energy consumption. The maximum deviation between the simulated and measured hourly power consumption is 9.7 % at 18:00 p.m. and the minimum deviation is 3.0 % at 12:00 a.m. The mean deviation of the simulation is lower than 10 %. This proves that the energy modeling of the air conditioning system is quite accurate. On this basis, it was assumed that accurate results could also be obtained from the specified reading rooms. The subsequent analysis was focused on the energy consumption of the reading room when different control methods were used. 3.3 Building zoning and thermostat control mode The basic zoning of reading room is to separate it into the internal and external zone. The area in the vicinity of envelopes with a depth of 4 m is taken as the external zone, while the other area is the inner zone. Besides, for the reading rooms with irregular shape, the zoning should be based on the actual layout of the spaces and the distribution of operative temperature. Once the zoning is set, thermostat control of air temperature and operative temperature can be applied based on the temperatures of each zone. For the west reading room, according to the field measuring data, the operative temperature at each test point on the test day was calculated, as shown in Fig. 10 . It can be seen that the operative temperature at testing point 1 is the lowest, and the operative temperature at test point 3 is the highest, with an average difference of 2.0 °C between them. The operative temperatures at test point 2 and 4 are similar. For large spaces with depth more than 5 m, internal and external zoning are usually considered separately [34] during the design of air-conditioning system. Generally, the space within about 3∼4 m from the external enclosure is taken as the external zone, while the rest is the internal zone [35]. In this building, the eastward and westward reading rooms are quite large. However, zoning was not considered in the design of air conditioning system, and the thermal environment was just controlled by the air temperature. In simulation, the zone within 4 m from the envelope was taken as the exterior zone, and the rest of the zone was the inner zone. For the west and east reading rooms, the exterior zones were further specified according to the difference in operative temperature distribution. The south and north reading rooms on the second floor of the library are more regular in structure, and the depth of the building is also far more than 5 m, so the exterior and inner zones are also separated. The specific zoning divisions are shown in Fig. 11 . Using the air temperature and operative temperature of different zones as the control signals of the air conditioning system, different control methods were proposed for the reading rooms. For the west reading room, the change of temperatures in zone 2 and 3 were quite similar, and only the temperature signals of zone 2 were adopted in simulation. Therefore, six control methods using the air temperature or operative temperature of zone 1, 2, 4 were applied in simulation. Considering the symmetry of the west and east rooms, similar control conditions were also assigned for the east room, in which the signals came from zones 5, 6 and 8. Besides, a combined zoning control mode was also proposed, in which air temperature was used in control for the inner zone and the operative temperature (the inner zones was zone 2 for the west room, and zone 6 for the east room) was used for the exterior zone. The naming of the control modes is shown in Table 3 , and the target air/operative temperature in each control mode was set to 26 °C. The south and north facing reading rooms were just divided into the inner and exterior zones, and the air temperature or operative temperature of the inner and exterior zones were used as the control signals, resulting in four control methods. The target air temperature/operative temperature in each control method was also set to 26 °C, and the naming of the control methods is shown in Table 4 . In the following analysis, the simplified names of each control method were used. 4 Simulation results 4.1 The west-facing reading room 4.1.1 The overall thermal comfort The main indicators for evaluating indoor thermal comfort include predicted mean comfort vote (PMV), effective temperature (ET), new effective temperature (ET*), standard effective temperature (SET), etc., among which the PMV indicator is widely used [36\u201339]. Fanger proposed the PMV index in 1970 [40], which classified the indoor thermal environment into seven levels from −3 to 3 according to the occupants\u2019 thermal sensation. Fanger also proposed the PPD index to show the predictive percentage of dissatisfaction rate of a group people to the same thermal environment. According to the correlation, when PMV is 0, the PPD is 5 %. The PMV-PPD model was used to evaluate the thermal comfort of the zones. In the calculation of PMV, the clothing thermal resistance was set to 0.5 clo, the metabolic rate was 1.0 met, the air velocity was 0.1 m/s, and the relative humidity was 60 %. The air and mean radiant temperature were based on the simulation results of each zone, and then the operative temperature was decided. The PMV-PPD of each zone could be different. In order to evaluate the overall thermal comfort of reading room, the overall PPD (PPDz) was calculated by zone weighting. The calculation formula is as following: (6) P P D z = ∑ i = 1 n A i A P P D i where PPDz is the overall dissatisfaction rate, %; Ai is the zone of each zone, m2; A is the total building zone, m2; PPDi is the PPD calculated for each zone, % The Design Code for Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning in Civil Buildings of China (GB 50736-2012) [31] classifies comfort levels into Level I and Level II. The PMV is controlled within the range of ±0.5 (PPD<10 %) in Level I, and Level II corresponds to PMV in the range of ±1 (PPD<27 %). For public buildings, in order to realize energy saving, the recommended thermal comfort level is Level II, i.e., PPDz should be controlled within 27 %. In the analysis, if the time ratio of the PPDz>27 % is less than 5 % of the total occupied hours during the cooling season, the thermal environment was considered to meet the thermal comfort requirement [31]. Besides, in order to including the situation of different thermal comfort levels, the time ratio of PPDz<10 %, 10 %<PPDz<15 %, and 15 %<PPDz<27 % were also calculated. The indoor PPDz on the test day in the west-facing reading room was calculated by equation (6). The results of the PPD of each zone for the testing day is shown in Fig. 12 . From Fig. 12, on the testing day, when TC-Ta1 is used, the PPD in Zone 4 will be higher than 27 % after 10:00 a.m. For the other three zones, the PPD is lower than 27 % throughout the day. When TC-Ta2 is used, the PPD in Zone 4 is higher than 27 % between 14:00 and 16:00. For the other three zones, the PPD is lower than 27 % throughout the day. When TC-Ta4, TC-To1, TC-To2, TC-To4 and Zoning control are used, the PPD of each zone are lower than 27 %, while the last four thermostat control can keep the PPD of all the zones close to or lower than 10 %. This indicates that using operative temperatures and zoning in control can keep the indoor environment to a higher level of thermal comfort. The indoor overall thermal comfort on the testing day and the whole cooling season during the operation time of the air conditioning system was analyzed, which was represented by the calculated PPDz. The results for the testing day and cooling season are shown in Fig. 13 (a) and (b). From Fig. 13, on the testing day, when controlled by TC-Ta1 and TC-Ta2, for about 50 % and 10 % of the time the PPDz is higher than 27 % in the reading room. For all the other control methods, the PPDz is lower than 27 %, which meet the basic thermal comfort requirement. If the thermal comfort level is enhanced to PPDz<15 %, only the control methods (TC-To1, TC-To2, TC-To4) with operative temperature could meet the requirement. During the cooling season, when controlled by TC-Ta1 and TC-Ta2, for about 9 % and 7 % of the time, the PPDz is higher than 27 % in the reading room. For all the other control methods, the PPDz is lower than 27 %. If the thermal comfort level is increased to PPDz<15 %, neither the operative temperature control nor the air temperature control could meet the requirements. For the west reading room, it is exposed to solar radiation during noon and afternoon. The zone difference in operative temperatures is quite large, which cannot be eliminated by the proposed seven controls. To achieve higher thermal comfort levels, the indoor units of different zones in the reading room should be installed and controlled separately. According to Fig. 13, under the thermostat control of TC-Ta1 and TC-Ta2, there are times that PPDz higher than 27 %. From Fig. 12, the PPDz of zone 4 is much higher, which may cause the higher PPDz of the whole reading room. Zone 4 locates in the west and south side of the exterior zone, which can be influenced by the solar radiation for a longer time than the other zones. For spaces like zone 4, the commonly used air temperature control of TC-Ta1 and TC-Ta2 may lead to poor thermal comfort situation. When other control modes are used, the thermal comfort of each zone and the overall thermal comfort of the reading room meet the requirements. 4.1.2 Switching boundary temperature and applicable range for the thermostat controls If the air or operative temperature of a certain zone was constantly used in control during the cooling season, due to the change of outdoor climate, the thermal comfort of some zones may not meet the thermal comfort requirements, or the indoor thermal environment may be kept to a high level of comfort resulting in increased energy consumption. Considering the effect of outdoor climate changes, the indoor thermal comfort under different control methods was further analyzed. The PPDz under each outdoor temperature for all the control modes was calculated. The outdoor temperature range suitable for each control mode was explored. The corresponding outdoor temperatures, upon which the PPDz will be on the margin of thermal comfort were decided for each control mode. These temperatures were defined as the switching boundary temperature ranges. If the outdoor temperature is higher than the switching boundary temperature range of the current control mode, the indoor PPDz will be higher than the limit. In such case, the control mode should switch to another with lower switching boundary temperature range to satisfy the thermal comfort requirement. The switching boundary temperature ranges can be used to achieve the thermal comfort demand without causing unwanted increase in energy consumption. Based on the simulation results, the switching boundary temperature ranges of different level of comfort for each control method were calculated, which is applicable for outdoor temperature lower than 35 °C. The relationship between outdoor temperature and PPDz is shown in Fig. 14 . When TC-Ta1 and TC-Ta2 control is used, there were times that PPDz become higher than 27 %. For the other five controls, there are no outdoor temperature conditions that PPDz will exceed 27 %. The outdoor temperature values corresponding to PPDz of a certain level are decided as the switching boundary temperature range. The switching boundary temperature ranges of TC-Ta1 and TC-Ta2 are 26.3\u201326.6 °C and 30.7\u201330.9 °C, respectively, which means that when the outdoor temperature exceeds 26.3\u201326.6 °C or 30.7\u201330.9 °C respectively, the comfort requirements of PPDz<27 % cannot be kept using TC-Ta1 or TC-Ta2. For the other control modes, the requirement of PPDz<27 % can be ensured even the outdoor temperature reaches to 35 °C. The switching boundary temperature range is much higher when operative temperature controls are used than those of the air temperature controls. This indicates that the operative temperature control can ensure thermal comfort in a wider range of outdoor temperature. The switching boundary temperature ranges for higher comfort levels (PPDz<15 % and PPDz<10 %) are also given in Fig. 14. The boundary temperatures of the control mode from left to right in the figure are 18.8\u201319.2 °C, 20.1\u201320.3 °C, 23.6\u201323.8 °C, 25.9\u201326.0 °C, 27.5\u201327.7 °C, 29.5\u201329.6 °C, and 31.7\u201331.8 °C for the PPDz less than 15 %. It becomes 16.7\u201316.9 °C, 18.3\u201318.4 °C, 20.3\u201320.7 °C, 22.8\u201322.9 °C, 24.7\u201324.8 °C, 26.9\u201327 °C, and 29.2\u201329.3 °C if the PPDz is less than 10 %. The switching boundary temperature range decreases when the comfort level is enhanced. This implies that with higher comfort level the applicable temperature range drops for each control mode in summer. 4.1.3 Electricity consumption According to the simulation results, the unit area electricity consumption of the west-facing reading room under each control method in the whole cooling season is calculated, as shown in Fig. 15 . In the air temperature control, as shown in Fig. 13(b), when TC-Ta1 and TC-Ta2 control are used, the time ratio of PPDz >27 % is 9 % and 7 % respectively, which does not meet the thermal comfort requirement. TC-Ta4 is the one that can keep PPDz less than 27 % among the three air temperature control methods, i.e., comfort requirements can be satisfied. Therefore, the power consumption of TC-Ta4 is compared with the others. When the air conditioning system supplies cooling, the power consumption of the control modes from TC-Ta1 to TC-To4 are 23.00 kWh/m2, 23.95 kWh/m2, 25.14 kWh/m2, 25.74 kWh/m2, 26.23 kWh/m2, 27.07 kWh/m2 and 28.14 kWh/m2, respectively. The power consumption of the optimized control is 24.13 kWh/m2. The maximum difference in power consumption between the operative temperature control and the air temperature control is 5.14 kWh/m2. The zoning control and the operative temperature control can meet the indoor thermal comfort requirements in the cooling season, but more energy is used than that of the TC-Ta4 control. The energy cost of TC-To4 control is 11.9 % higher than the TC-Ta4 control. The energy using of optimized control based on switching boundary control is 4.0 % lower than the TC-Ta4 control. The power consumption of optimized control is similar to that of the TC-Ta2 control. From the comparison, although the thermal environment controlled by the operative temperatures is better than that controlled by the air temperatures, it increases the power consumption significantly. The power consumption varies when the temperature signals come from different zones. Controls that can satisfy the thermal comfort requirement are the TC-Ta4, Zoning control, TC-To1, TC-To2, TC-To4 and Optimized control. The one with the lowest power consumption is the Optimized control. Therefore, it is particularly important to provide a reasonable control strategy for the air conditioning system to minimize the energy consumption under the premise of meeting the thermal comfort requirement. Based on the comparative analysis of the simulated data, it is found that the optimal control based on switching boundary temperature range is the most energy-efficient control mode to meet the thermal comfort requirement. 4.2 Factors of different floors and orientations 4.2.1 West-facing reading room on top floor The previous results were based on the west reading room in the middle layer. Further simulation for the top floor were conducted and analyzed. In this case, the west-facing reading room on the top floor of the library was simulated. The data for the west-facing top-floor reading room for the typical day and cooling season are analyzed. The simulation study of the operative temperature distribution for this reading room on the testing day reveals that under the seven control modes, the operative temperature distribution of the top floor reading room are similar to that of the middle floor. In particular, as shown in Fig. 11(a), Zone 3 in the middle layer of the west-facing reading room has the highest operative temperature, and Zone 1 has the lowest operative temperature. the operative temperature of Zone 2 and Zone 4 s are almost the same. The similar distribution of operative temperatures is found for the reading room on the top layer. In the cooling season, affected by the thermal radiation surface of the roof, the mean operative temperature of the top floor reading room under each control mode is 0.5 °C, 0.5 °C, 0.4 °C, 0.3 °C, 0.2 °C, 0.2 °C, and 0.1 °C higher than that of in the middle floor, respectively. The operative temperature is the highest when controlled by TC-Ta1 and the lowest when controlled by TC-To4. The effect of the mean radiant temperature is taken into account when operative temperature control is used. The PPDz of the top reading room in relation to the outdoor temperature during the cooling season was calculated. The switching boundary temperature ranges for TC-Ta1 and TC-Ta2 modes are 26.1 °C and 30.0 °C, respectively. For all the other control modes, the PPDz can be kept within the range of less than 27 %. Comparison shows that the switching boundary temperature ranges of the top floor is 0.7 °C lower in average than that of the middle layer for the corresponding control mode. Compared to the west reading room on the middle layer, the switching boundary temperature of the reading room on the top layer decreases, indicating the applicable outdoor range became smaller for each thermostat control. 4.2.2 Reading rooms with different orientations The simulation analysis of overall thermal comfort for the east-facing reading room on the middle layer was performed as illustrated in Figs. 16 and 17 . On the testing day, when controlled by TC-Ta5 and TC-Ta6, the PPDz is higher than 27 % for about 50 % and 10 % of the time, respectively. For the whole cooling season, the time ratio of PPDz>27 % is 10 % with TC-Ta5, and 8 % with TC-Ta6. For the east-facing reading room, when TC-Ta5 and TC-Ta6 controls are used, there are time that the PPDz higher than 27 %, indication that the thermal comfort requirement can not be assured. For the other control methods, both on the testing day and during the cooling season, the time ratio of PPDz>27 % is 0 %, meaning that the thermal comfort requirement can be assured. If the thermal comfort level is improved to PPDz<15 %, only the control methods with operative temperature (TC-To5, TC-To6, TC-To8) could meet this requirement on the testing day. For the whole cooling season, neither the operative temperature control nor the air temperature control could meet the requirement, which is similar to the situation of the west reading room. During the cooling season, for the east-facing reading room with the Zoning Control mode, or, the time ratio of 27 %>PPDz>15 % is 57 %, the time ratio of 15 %>PPDz>10 % is 22 %, and the time ratio of PPDz<10 % is 21 %. For the west-facing reading room, the time ratio becomes 56 %, 22 %, 22 %, respectively. This indicates that the effect of zoning control is similar for the west and east rooms. It can be found that under the same control mode, the time ratio of PPDz of different levels in the east- and west-facing reading rooms is almost the same, indicating that the east-west orientation has similar influence on thermal environment. Further simulation analysis of the overall thermal comfort in the south- and north-facing reading rooms during the cooling season were carried out, and the results are shown in Fig. 18 . Due to the influence of solar radiation, the comfort of the south-facing reading room is not as good as that of the north-facing reading room. The PPDz of the south-facing reading room exceeds 27 % for 9.2 % of the time when controlled by TC-Ta9. For the other control methods, both on the testing day and during the cooling season, the time ratio of PPDz>27 % is 0 %, meaning that the thermal comfort requirement can be assured. For the north-facing reading room, thermal comfort can be assured by all the control modes. For the south-facing reading room, the time ratio of 27 %>PPDz>15 % is 74 %, the time ratio of 15 %>PPDz>10 % is 19 %, the time ratio of PPDz<10 % is 7 %. For the north-facing reading room, it increases to 53 %, 26 %, and 21 %, respectively. The north-facing reading room has better thermal comfort condition than the south-facing reading room. The switching boundary temperature ranges of different control modes of the south- and north-facing reading rooms were also simulated and calculated, and the results are shown in Table 5 . For the south-facing reading room, the switching boundary temperature of TC-Ta9 is 30.4 °C if keep the PPDz within 27 %. For the other three control modes, this requirement can be met in any outdoor temperature conditions in summer. For the north-facing reading room, the PPDz is lower than 27 % with all the control methods, indicating that there are no boundary temperature limits for these controls. If the thermal comfort level is increased, the switching boundary temperature of each control for the north room are higher than that of the south room, with an average increment of 2.0 °C. This accounts for the wider range of outdoor air temperature variations that apply to the north-facing reading room when switching boundary temperature control modes. If the thermal comfort level is improved to PPDz<15 %, for the south reading room, the switching boundary temperature range is 21.6 °C for TC-Ta9, 22.9 °C for TC-Ta10, 28.4 °C forTC-To9, and 30.7 °C for Tc-To10. For the north room, it becomes 23.9 °C, 25.8 °C, 29.8 °C, and 31.8 °C, respectively. The energy consumption of the air conditioning system under different control modes for the reading rooms with different orientation in the cooling season is shown in Figs. 19 and 20 . For the east-facing reading room, the time ratio of PPDz >27 % is 10 % and 8 % when the TC-Ta5 and TC-Ta6 control mode are used. For the other control methods, the time ratio of PPDz >27 % is 0. Among the air temperature control modes that meet the thermal comfort requirements, the lowest power consumption is achieved with TC-Ta8. So the energy consumption of TC-Ta8 is selected as the reference in comparison. The power consumption of TC-Ta8 is 24.95 kWh/m2. The power consumption increases by 1.5 %, 3.5 %, 6.9 %, and 11.2 % respectively when the zoning control, TC-To5, TC-To6, and TC-To8 is used separately. The power consumption of the Optimized Control is 23.89 kWh/m2, with a 4.3 % reduction compared to TC-Ta8. The optimized control can achieve the lowest energy consumption, and satisfy the need of thermal comfort. Considering the indoor thermal comfort and power consumption of the east and west-facing reading rooms under different control modes, the optimized control mode based on the switching boundary temperature range proposed in this paper is the best way to keep thermal comfort with the least power consumption. For the south-facing reading room, the time ratio of PPDz >27 % is 9 % in the TC-Ta9 control mode, which does not meet the thermal comfort requirement. For the other controls, the PPDz is lower than 27 % all the time. Among the air temperature control modes that satisfy the thermal comfort requirement, the lowest power consumption is achieved with TC-Ta10. The energy consumption of TC-Ta10 is compared with that of the other controls. The power consumption increases by 6.5 % and 12.6 % respectively for the two operative temperature control modes, while the power consumption of the optimized control decreases by 3.1 %. The power consumption of the optimized control is 25.76 kWh/m2. To meet the thermal comfort requirement, the optimized control is the one with the lowest energy use for the south-facing reading room. For the north room, the time ration of PPDz >27 % was 0 in all the five control modes Among them, the air temperature control of TC-Ta11 has the lowest power consumption (21.84 kWh/m2). The power consumption of TC-Ta11 control is compared with the others. The power consumption increases by 3.2 % for TC-Ta12, 12.9 % for TC-To11, and 16.7 % for TC-To12, while the power consumption of the optimized control is the same to TC-Ta11. For the north room, TC-Ta11 and the optimized control can be used to keep thermal comfort with minimum energy consumption. Considering that the optimized control is more complex, TC-Ta1 would be fine for the north room. 4.3 Strategies for controlling the thermal environment Based on the results, the thermostat control strategies are suggested under the premise of satisfying thermal comfort needs with low energy increment. Considering the zoning number and the availability of air and operative temperature sensors, different control strategies are proposed for the reading rooms. the Specific strategies are provided in Table 6 . 5 Discussions and limitations This study contributes to current research in several ways. Since most of the existing studies are limited to using the mean operative temperatures in controlling the thermal environment, while those considering the zone difference of operative temperature doesn't provide suggestions in keep thermal comfort with low power consumption. Therefore, this paper mainly focuses on the thermal comfort and energy consumption of the use of air/operative temperature control based on different zones. Considering the characteristic of operative temperature, which will change as the outdoor temperature changes, the concept of switching boundary temperature range is introduced. The switching boundary temperature range provides an optimized way to control the indoor environment by different temperature signals during cooling, which can assure thermal comfort with low energy cost. The effect of floor location and orientation is also considered. However, there are also some limitations and issues that are beyond the scope of this study, such as the following. 1) The PMV-PPD model was used as a basis for thermal comfort, the model was set up with reference to typical summer clothing and activity level of office workers. The individual difference in clothing and activity were not considered. The on-site thermal comfort questionnaire was not collected, as the field test were carried out during summer vacation and there were few students staying in the library. In order to analyze the actual impact of different thermal environment parameters on thermal comfort within each zone, field questionnaires should be collected in the further study. 2) There are many fan-coils installed in the reading rooms, which brings difficulty to the on-site measurement of the supplied cooling energy. The validation of the energy model is based on the data from the building energy monitoring platform. The actual energy use for the reading room cannot be measured. It would be better to measure the cooling energy to verify the room model. 3) The analysis of thermal comfort and energy consumption for each of the proposed control methods were mainly carried out by simulation. The feasibility of practical applications and further optimization should also be considered in the subsequent study. For example, the switching boundary temperature ranges are determined based on the condition of the reading rooms through simulation. And the temperatures will change if the characters of envelops changed. For example, if the insulation of building envelope becomes better, the temperature of the wall surfaces in the room will be less affected by the outdoor climate, which will lead to the increase of the switching boundary temperature ranges. Besides, the operative temperature can be more even distributed in large spaces, which will lead to more simplified zoning and thermostat controls. In addition, in the model internal shading was set based on previous investigation. Thus the effect of solar radiation on the operative temperature is not fully considered in the switching boundary temperature range calculated. For conditions with stronger solar radiation in the space, both the switching boundary temperature range and the proposed control strategy can be different. This should be studied further. 4) The summer condition was simulated and analyzed. For heating season, the influence of control modes on the reading rooms with different orientation may be different. For example, the north room will be more easily affected by the cold radiation of building envelopes than the south room in winter. Besides, the results are based on convective units, further study is necessary for radiant units. 5) In this study, the reading rooms of the university library were studied. With different buildings and layout, the results should be verified further. The zoning method may also influence the results of thermostat controls. Further analysis should be conducted to generalize the rules under which the operative temperature or the air temperature control can be used. 6) The field study was conducted during summer vacation and there were fewer students stayed in the library. As students scatted in different reading rooms as they like, the indoor units of all the reading rooms were kept running, which led to waste of cooling energy. Considering this, part of the reading rooms and the related indoor units can be closed. Based on the results, when there are less students, the north-facing reading rooms with better thermal conditions should be opened in the first place to reduce cooling energy use. 7) In this study, the reading rooms were divided into zones according to the layout and distribution of operative temperatures. The north/south reading room is divided into inner and exterior zones. The east/west reading room is separated into several zones, and some of the zones are united into one zone in the thermostat control modes due to similar operative temperature characteristics. The result shows that both the operative temperature and air temperature distribution in the zones are not uniform, which leads to differences in thermal comfort and energy consumption when different control modes are used. If the thermostat control using air temperature is based on the most unfavorable zone, the energy consumption of the system will increase more significantly to meet the comfort requirement. If the thermostat control is based on the most favorable zone, the energy consumption can be decreased, but there is risk that the thermal comfort requirements cannot be met. The thermostat controls by operative temperate can always satisfy the thermal comfort requirement, and the choice of operative temperature of different zones could affect the energy use. 8) In the simulation, the indoor air/operative temperature was set to 26 °C, which was same to the aimed air temperature in the actual library. If the temperature value changes in the model, the corresponding thermal comfort level will be different. The effect of zoning thermostat control based on air/operative temperature would not change though. According to the results of PPDz and switching boundary temperature ranges, with the increase of thermal comfort level, the energy use will sure to increase, and the switching boundary temperature ranges will decrease for each control mode. 9) In this study, considering the uneven distribution of air temperature in different zones, the air temperature controls are also simulated. Results showed that the thermal comfort and energy consumption are different too. If there are no difference in zone air temperature, the thermostat control based on air temperature of different zone would be unnecessary. For the operative temperature, it is also affected by the surface temperatures. With big windows or glass curtain walls in rooms, there will still be the regional difference in operative temperature will still exist. The thermostat controls based on different operative temperatures should be considered to keep thermal comfort. 6 Conclusions In this study, the effect of uneven distribution of operative temperature in large spaces were considered, and the thermostat control based on zoning air/operative temperature were studied. The control strategies with low energy increment while improving thermal comfort were explored. The study was based on reading rooms of a university library building, which was built recently. Based on the layout and operative temperature distribution, the reading rooms were divided into different zones. Different thermal environment control modes based on air/operative temperature of different zones were proposed. The effect of these control modes on thermal comfort and energy use was analyzed. The west-facing reading rooms on the middle and top floor were compared to analyze the effect of roof. The reading rooms with different orientations including west, east, south and north were also analyzed. The main conclusions are as follows. 1) With the exception of the north-facing reading room, the use of air temperature in control cannot satisfy the thermal comfort needs, in which the time ratio of PPDz <27 % is less than 5 % of the total occupancy time. 2) When the proposed thermostat controls are used, the thermal comfort is increased. For the west-facing reading room, when controlled by TC-Ta1, the time ratio of PPDz>27 % is 9 %, the time ratio of 15 %<PPDz<27 % is 68 %, the time ratio of 10 %<PPDz<15 % is 18 %, while the time ratio is 5 % for PPDz<10 %. When the zoning control is used, the time ratio that PPDz>27 % become 0, and the time ratio for better comfort levels increases. the time ration of 15 %<PPDz<27 % increases to 57 %, the time ratio of 10 %<PPDz<15 % increases to 22 %, and the time ratio of PPDz<10 % increases to 21 %. For the optimized control, the increase in thermal comfort levels are similar. 3) For the east, west, and south facing reading rooms, the indoor thermal comfort is improved considerably when operative temperature control is used compared to the air temperature control. The thermal comfort of the reading room can be assured for all the room with different orientation and floors. 4) For the reading rooms, energy consumption increases when operative temperature control is used. The energy consumption of the east, west and south facing reading rooms is increased at least by 3.5 %, 4.3 % and 6.5 %, under the condition of meeting the basic thermal comfort requirement. 5) Considering the influence of outdoor air temperature on the mean radiant and operative temperature, the concept of switching boundary temperature ranges is proposed for each control mode, which corresponds to the applicable outdoor temperature range of each control mode. On this basis, an optimized control strategy based on switching boundary temperature range is recommended, which aims to achieve the lowest energy consumption while satisfying the thermal comfort requirement. 6) For the east, west and south facing reading rooms, when using the optimal control method based on switching boundary temperature ranges, energy consumption is reduced by an average of 4 %, 4.3 %, and 3.1 % compared to the air temperature control mode satisfying the thermal comfort requirement. 7) The control method based on the switching boundary temperature range needs a few temperature sensors installed in different zones, which makes the practical use more complicated. To ensure thermal comfort while keep low energy use, the simpler zoning control is recommended, in which the air temperature control is used in the inner zone and the operative temperature control is used in the exterior zone. 8) In order to reduce the initial investment of thermostat sensors and to ensure indoor thermal comfort, thermostat controls based on air temperature are recommended. For the east-, west- and south-facing reading room, air temperature sensor can be installed in the exterior zones with direct solar radiation (Zone 4, Zone 8 and Zone 10). For the north-facing reading room, air temperature sensor can be just installed in the inner zone (Zone 11). Additionally, if the thermal comfort level is improved, the air temperature control can be changed to the operative temperature control by replacing the sensors. This study investigated the effect of zoning thermostat control based on air/operative temperature, and aims to improve thermal comfort with lower energy increment. The applicability of zoning controls based on air and operative temperature is discussed. The proposed optimized control based on switching boundary temperature combines the factor of changing outdoor temperature, and provides new concept in control strategy. The recommended zoning control is more practical and can be easily applied in thermal environment control of large spaces. The paper can be a useful reference in the study of thermostat control by operative temperature.

Reading rooms in a library were divided into several zones based on the distribution of operative temperature. Using air temperature of the inner zone in thermostat control yielded the lowest energy consumption but the poorest thermal comfort level. Conversely, using operative temperature of the least favorable exterior zone resulted in higher energy consumption and comfort levels. The suggested optimal control based on switching boundary temperature minimized energy consumption while satisfying the thermal comfort requirement. The switching boundary temperature range on the top floor is 0.7 °C lower than on the middle floor due to the influence of the roof. The thermostat control modes had similar effects on the east and west reading rooms. The switching boundary temperature ranges of north room was 2.0 °C higher than those of the south room. Zoning control using air temperature control in the inner zone and operative temperature control in the exterior zone was recommended as a much simple mode to keep thermal comfort with low energy use. This study provides insights about the use of operative temperature in zoning thermostat control and theoretical guidance for practical implementation.",
