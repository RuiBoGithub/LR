The increasing popularity of home automation and the rising global electricity costs have emphasized the importance of energy conservation for consumers. With smart meters, machine learning models can anticipate equipment behavior by monitoring and recording residential power use. Multi-Energy Management Systems, which allow smart grid flexibility, have garnered interest. Smart meters and smart energy gadgets in homes require autonomous multi-energy management systems. These systems should efficiently utilize real-time data to plan device consumption, reducing costs for end users. The model incorporates two Long Short-Term Memory networks, capturing short-term and long-term dependencies in energy consumption patterns. This enables the Multi-Energy Management Systems to make accurate predictions and manage energy resources in real-time. The primary objectives are to minimize reliance on the grid and maximize the utilization of renewable energy sources. The proposed Deep Dual- Long Short-Term Memory model achieves impressive accuracy rates, with scores ranging from 97% to 99% for recall, F1-score, and precision. Numerical findings demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method compared to existing approaches, showcasing its ability to lower energy consumption and meet operational constraints. The results indicate that the proposed strategy optimizes energy use, providing cost savings and satisfying user requirements.

This field develops automated methods to balance smart household energy demand and supply, reducing energy expenditures, improving energy efficiency, and improving grid resilience. An automated multi-energy management system (MTEMS), gives homes improved energy usage and generation control. Advanced algorithms and predictive models can optimize energy use depending on customer preferences, weather conditions, power tariffs, and other factors, improving comfort, cost savings, and environmental effects. These systems may also integrate electric vehicles (EVs) with home energy systems for smart charging and discharging to maximize renewable energy use and reduce grid load. This field also benefits utilities. Multi-energy management systems can help utilities understand home energy usage, renewable energy output, and demand response. Such data allows utilities estimate energy consumption, update grid infrastructure, and execute demand-side control programs. These systems may also seamlessly integrate distributed energy resources (DERs) into the grid, maximizing usage and decreasing grid reinforcement costs. Significant flexibility constraints are posed by the rising integration of erratic and unpredictable renewable energy sources (RES). In this light, integrated optimization and management of multi-energy systems (MES), which involves the optimal interaction of electricity, gas, and heating systems, has a significant potential to provide the required flexibility to allow an efficient transition to a future that uses less carbon-based energy. They can shift supply and demand between energy sectors by utilizing various forms of energy storage, in contrast to conventional energy systems, whose sectors are managed independently (Dall'Anese et al., 2017). A home energy management system (HEMS) has become increasingly important for consumers to lower their overall electric expenses and maintain the dependability and durability of household electric appliances. As more IoT-enabled intelligent home appliances, such as air conditioners, washers, and refrigerators, are installed to provide customers with more contemporary amenities, end users must deploy more intelligent systems, like HEMSs, to operate their home appliances dependably and efficiently (Liu et al., 2015). Theoretical, data, algorithms, and empirical research shape this discipline. Mathematical models and optimization frameworks for multi-energy system dynamics are used in theoretical research. Understanding energy usage, renewable energy generation, and user behavior requires data analysis. Advanced control techniques, forecasting models, and optimization algorithms are developed for multi-energy systems. Empirical studies test recommended solutions in real-world pilot projects and trials. This sector needs interoperability frameworks and standards for energy management systems, smart devices, and communication technologies. When power, heating, cooling, and transportation are integrated, data exchange, coordination, and control are difficult. Open and interoperable platforms are needed to bridge this gap. The increasing utilization of information and communications technology distinguishes the smart grid as the next generation of power systems in generating, transmitting, distributing, and utilizing electrical energy (for instance, the Internet of Things). Considering that smart houses are an evolution of regular homes, numerous potentials exist to reduce energy costs. Utilizing internal networks, intelligent controls, and home automation as three components (Wu et al., 2017). Energy use has to be significantly reduced across the board due to the present energy crisis. As more household appliances are installed, energy usage in residential areas has increased. The problem of excessive energy consumption in residential buildings is being approached from multiple angles, the most prominent of which are promoting energy efficiency and utilizing non-traditional or renewable energy sources. To reduce the cost of household energy, one should consider both energy generation and consumption simultaneously. Numerous studies have proposed home energy management systems (HEMS). To give simple access to home energy usage, optimization of home power consumption based on power line communication (PLC) has been researched (IEEE Std, 2003; Lv et al., 2022). Moving toward smart energy management will require adjustments to both the way energy is supplied and the way the market utilizes energy since device control and management of energy require two different ZigBee networks. These include employing ZigBee for sub-energy, neighborhood area networks for sub-energy inside a home or apartment, and ZigBee for sub-energy. Companies have successfully employed ZigBee in recent years to create solutions for various applications, including managing industrial plants and controlling consumer electrical devices. Other uses include efficiency and energy management, automation of residential and commercial buildings, and control of consumer electrical devices. To produce ZigBee goods, the Agreement provides the ideal framework for budding service and product companies. IEEE 802.15.4 and ZigBee 2006 could both be used in intelligent energy networks. To achieve consistent performance, it is recommended that the bulk of the network's nodes base themselves on either one or the other stack profile. Products with the ZigBee smart energy certification must be built on a platform compliant with ZigBee. The development of HEMS has made use of artificial intelligence technologies. It was proposed to use distributed algorithm-based Artificial Neural Networks (Lv et al., 2022) to make appropriate energy management decisions. Aiming to attain the best temperature scheduling, (Lv & Song, 2019) presented the demand response performed by HEMS, integrating machine learning to forecast power pricing and forecasts outdoor's temperatures. Specialized machine learning (ML) techniques for energy efficiency may help smart homes and result in better results for energy conservation. Machine learning techniques are more productive and economical than manual management and can save a sizable amount of resources. This study examines a HEMS optimization algorithm that uses deep dual Long Short Term Memory (DD-LSTM). The following list summarizes the paper's significant contributions. \u2022 In this paper proposed the novel deep learning approach DD-LSTM for multi-energy management in smart residences. \u2022 The experimental results, based on simulations, demonstrate that the proposed method can reduce the amount of money spent on power. \u2022 In addition, the proposed strategy can achieve a more effective and reasonable equilibrium between maintaining comfortable circumstances and reducing disbursements associated with using energy. The remaining parts of the paper are laid out in the following fashion: Section 1.1 discusses the research on energy management. The subsequent section (Section 3), the proposed approach and the LSTM architecture will be addressed. Section 4 details the experimental setup for our suggested research project and the dataset used for the experiments. The replication results are presented in Section 5, while the decisions are discussed in Section 6. 1.1 Related works A Home Energy Management System, or HEMS for short, is a system that is designed to manage a household's energy output and consumption. This system is designed to be installed in a home and comprises hardware and software. This allows homeowners to participate in the power market. Due to recent advancements in household metering, monitoring, and control, which allow for more reliable energy management and innovative economic models like demand response programs, these systems are becoming more and more prevalent. Shareef et al. (2018) presented examples of control systems, such as rule-based and artificial intelligence (AI), with the shared aims of energy savings, CO emission reductions, and user comfort. Using self-learning AI techniques for HEMS was also emphasized as future development. According to Y et al. (2021) research on energy management systems (EMS) from the same period, 34% of the articles in that field are authored by people who live in their homes. In their classification of papers on reinforcement learning for demand response, (Li & Liu, 2022; Wu et al., 2022) divided them into four categories: DHW and electric vehicles, HVAC, distributed generation with storage, and smart appliances, the first two categories accounted for more than two-thirds of the most recent publications. In certain studies, methods for estimating the energy consumption of residential structures based on AI procedures and statistics were recommended. ANNs-based energy consumption prediction models have outperformed alternative methodologies (Cheng et al., 2017) because these models can address sophisticated non-linear problems. Employing a combination of optimization and prediction algorithms has thus increased the performance of building energy consumption in literature to control and conserve energy efficiently. To forecast energy use in residential and non-residential buildings, the author (Min et al., 2023) built an energy database and trained different AI models on it. To calculate the life cycle of energy consumption in residential constructions, further research (Liu et al., 2023) suggests simulation-based methodologies. The energy required for heating and cooling is computed using these techniques. Modeling the calculation of heating and cooling energy was one for the Grasshopper simulation tool (Zhang et al., 2022). To predict the indoor thermal balance of buildings, models based on ANN have been created based on various non-residential structures' geometries, traits, and data (Xiao et al., 2021). Additionally, several AI techniques have been applied to evaluate how effectively buildings use energy (Yuan & Yang, 2022; Tan et al., 2022). Energy consumption in residential buildings has been predicted using the Artificial Neural Network(ANN) model, which applies consumer electricity usage based on user behavior. This study is based on a collection of 24-hour activity data from people living alone (Lee et al., 2019). Several studies also compared how well prediction algorithms predicted hotel energy use. The resemblances highlight how crucial ANN-based models are for predicting energy use (Ahmad et al., 2017). Over the past few years, the residential house age has been unpredictably advancing, eventually encroaching on mainstream markets and consumer sectors. However, there is a clear need to review the situation and suggest an ideal system for consuming energy in residential structures. Using deep deterministic policy gradients as their foundation, (Ren et al., 2022) offers an energy management method. It is crucial to note that neither the creation of a thermal dynamics model nor prior knowledge of uncertain parameters is a prerequisite for the suggested technique. The recreation results, which were based on real-world trails, demonstrate that the method is reliable and efficient. Recurrent neural networks are used to solve the consecutive judgment issue by Paridari et al. (2018); Shahriar and Sabbir Rahman (2015); Wang et al. (2022). The RNN is developed offsite using historical data on later part demand, PV production, duration tariffs, and the best battery charging condition. In this scenario, the ideal state-of-charge trace was created by solving a linear mixed integer program obtained from time series and PV traces and rates to lower daily power expenditures. The trained RNN is referred to as a policy function approximation (PFA), and its output is filtered by a control strategy to identify an efficient and valuable day-ahead state of charge. In addition, he offers an essentially perfect plug-and-play planning and control approach for their HEMSs, considering that fresh consumers are constantly adopting PV-storage systems without their historical data. The effectiveness of the proposed method is then evaluated numerically about best practices. This study Lin et al. (2022) tackled energy consumption optimization using an energy management approach. The accuracy and miss rate of energy consumption predictions were calculated using the data fusion technique presented in the proposed study. Additionally, the study reported a prediction accuracy of 92 percent, which exceeded the accuracy of any other previously reported technique. In the previous study Tavoosi et al. (2022), the researchers utilized a Recurrent Type-II Fuzzy Neural Networks (RT2FNN) controller that relied on Radial Basis Function Networks (RBFN) for the power control and voltage regulation of the wind turbine equipped with the Doubly Fed Induction Generator (DFIG). To develop the model, the voltage profile at each bus and the reactive power of the power grid was provided as input and output, respectively, to the RT2FNN for training purposes. A real-time energy management strategy for a hybrid energy ship was proposed (Zhang et al., 2022) based on an approximate predictive control model. An energy management framework was initially established using model predictive control to minimize operating costs and deviations from the reference state of charge. Subsequently, machine learning algorithms were trained offline to approximate the optimal control actions derived from model predictive control. The performance of various machine learning algorithms was quantitatively analyzed. Finally, a ferry equipped with photovoltaic technology was taken as a case study to select the suitable machine learning algorithm and determine the required number of samples. The results demonstrated that the proposed strategy ensured optimization performance and reduced computational requirements, enabling real-time energy management operation in hybrid energy ships. Many existing research studies on energy management systems for smart residences have focused on individual energy sources or specific appliances, yet to consider the holistic integration of multiple energy sources and devices. This fragmented approach limits the overall effectiveness and efficiency of the energy management system. Some previous research studies have utilized traditional forecasting models or simple machine learning algorithms to predict energy demand and supply. However, these approaches may need to capture the complex patterns and dependencies in energy consumption data, leading to limited prediction accuracy. Existing energy management systems often prioritize cost optimization or load balancing without considering the residents' comfort and preferences. This approach may result in suboptimal energy utilization and dissatisfaction among the residents. The proposed system addresses the limitation of fragmented approaches by providing a holistic integration of multiple energy sources, such as solar panels, batteries, and the grid, as well as various appliances and devices within the smart residence. This integration allows for comprehensive energy management and optimization. The innovation lies in using deep dual-LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks for energy demand and supply prediction. LSTM networks can capture long-term dependencies and complex patterns in time-series data, enabling more accurate predictions than traditional forecasting models. The dual-LSTM architecture further enhances prediction accuracy by modeling demand and supply factors simultaneously. The research questions rely on, 1. What are the most effective strategies and technologies for integrating renewable energy sources into urban energy systems to achieve greater energy sustainability? 2. How can energy storage systems be optimized to enhance the utilization of intermittent renewable energy sources and ensure a stable and reliable energy supply? 3. What are the key barriers and challenges in implementing energy efficiency measures in buildings, and how can these be overcome to achieve sustainable energy consumption? 4. What are the social, economic, and environmental impacts of transitioning to a decentralized energy system, and how can these impacts be effectively managed to ensure sustainable development? 2 Materials and methods 2.1 IoT-based smart residence environment Energy harvesting is essential in IoT environments for energy management services, battery lifetime, and finite cordless capacity to allow smart devices to move about. Because of environmental characteristics such as machine-to-machine and human-to-machine interactions that take place in an Internet of Things environment, energy harvesting features have the potential to make use of specific power generation environments such as wind, thermoelectric resources, and solar. A smart home built on the Internet of Things (IoT) is seen in Fig. 1 . This section's design discusses the recommended methods for reducing energy consumption in residential structures. The proposed methodology uses predictive optimization as part of a task-level management mechanism. The proposed energy consumption strategy clarifies the situation by splitting the household energy management system into virtual and physical domains. Sensors and actuators for home energy management systems are among the resources present in the physical space. A refrigerator, air conditioner, and heater are just some energy-consuming appliances. Humidity, temperature, and CO2 sensors are just a few examples of sensors used to monitor and manage the thermal comfort of residential spaces. The virtualization process serves as the foundation for the virtual space. Appliances and sensors become virtual objects thanks to the virtualization process. The proposed task-level management, optimization, prediction, and rule-based controller modules form the framework for the virtual environment. To effectively use the limited IoT resources, task-level management is the main advantage. With the task manager, task-level management is carried out. Task mapping and scheduling are used by the task manager to deploy the tasks in the proper order after they have been generated by the energy management services. A device management module that manages the device profile using virtual objects collects contextual data from sensors. The best time for appliances to last is predicted via predictive optimization. The predictive optimization and control module offers a regulated living space for energy depletion management while upholding the thermal well-being of the living space. 2.2 Deep-dual LSTM (DS-LSTM) 2.2.1 LSTM The proposed methodology is based on long short-term memory (LSTM), which employs weather data to forecast and predict patterns. With a unique variety of recurrent neural networks (RNN), the LSTM can easily handle spatiotemporal data. The memory unit can teach long short-term memory how parameters depend on each other. Although the memory units enable the network to learn from the data, the modal content they forget gate is used to erase the prior concealed state. Fig. 3 depicts the LSTM architecture. The memory unit for energy monitoring is part of the design, together with the forget gate, output gate, and input gate. The long short-term memory model's cell state transmits information about past states by moving across the network. The information from the prior state is what the model uses to forecast the latter output. This is challenging for time series data, such as weather, energy, and videos. The time series data form the foundation of our energy monitoring and management research. The other input, which depends on the other input at different time scales, is the foundation of energy monitoring. In the long short-term memory (LSTM), the gates output, input, memory cells, and forgot gate govern the information flow, data storage in the memory, and data removal from the network. The LSTM, dense, and dropout layers comprise the model. The flowchart for the working principle is shown in Fig. 2 . (1) I k = σ ( W x i x k + W h i h t − 1 + W c i c t − 1 + b i (2) F t = σ ( W x F x t + W h F h t − 1 + W c F c t − 1 + b F (3) M t = f g t ⊙ M t − 1 + i t ⊙ tanh ( W x M x t + W h M h t − 1 + b c (4) O t = σ ( W x O x t + W h O h t − 1 + W c O c t − 1 + b O (5) h t = O t ⊙ tanh ( c t ) The symbol σ represents the activation function sigmoid. The weight metrics W x i is i ∈ { I , F , O , M } which is the weight of input, forget, output and memory cell. The weight matrices W c i for i ∈ { I , F , O } is connection of the diagonal matrix of all other gates from the memory cell. (6) M t = F ( c t − 1 , h t − 1 , x t ; w l s t m , b l s t m (7) h t = g ( h t − 1 , c t − 1 , x t ; w l s t m , b l s t m ) Where the value of F (.) and g (.) is derived from the Eqs. (1) and (5). w l s t m includes all the weight parameters (8) W x I , W h I , W c I , W x F , W h F , W c F , W x M , W h M , W x O , W h O , W c O } and b l s t m includes all the bias parameters (9) { b I , b F , b c , b O } 2.2.2 Deep-dual LSTM Fig. 4 illustrates that there are three stages in the Dual-LSTM framework: data processing, training, and testing. The preparation of the data is done to make the sensor signals more suitable for training and testing. During the training phase, the LSTM1 that was specifically built to identify change points is initially trained using the training dataset. LSTM layers are stacked two high in the deep dual LSTM network. On the one hand, this was done to enhance the structural spatial properties to increase characterization capacities. Contrarily, this was done to extract the temporal dynamic properties of the frame and learn sequence relations among time series vectors. 2.3 Experimental setup Using Keras and TensorFlow in a Python environment, the experiment was conducted. Quadratic loss function and mean squared error are used to calculate the loss. Adam is the optimizer used in our suggested work. An artificial model structure using the activation functions Sigmoid, Tanh, and Relu. The model summary employed for the LSTM model is shown in Fig. 5 . The layer is connected to the dropout value, is intended to avoid overfitting. Neural networks in two unique designs were built. Comparatively speaking to the second LSTM version, or \"LSTM v2,\" the original version, or \"LSTM v1\u201d. LSTM v1 and v2 is made up of the values and unit shown in the Table 1 . Because of its increased complexity compared to LSTMv1, LSTMv2 required more time to train. In the final part of this presentation, we will discuss the process of optimizing and training our network. The cross-entropy loss function is minimized by our network as follows. (10) L = − ∑ i = 1 N [ y i l o g a i + ( 1 − y i ) log ( 1 − a i ) ] + λ ∥ Θ ∥ 2 2 Where a represents the result of the softmax layer's calculation. \u2032 is a representation of the network's parameters in'their entirety, while λ ∥ Θ ∥ 2 2 is the L2 regularization. Stochastic Gradient Descent is a method that can be used to make updates to the network's parameters (S'D). The Adam optimizer is the one that which rely on the majority of the time on our network. The Table 2 shows the input parameters used in our DD-LSTM model after large number of ablation studies Historical energy consumption data provides insights into the energy usage patterns, helping the system to make accurate predictions and optimize energy allocation. The Deep Dual-LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) approach is a suitable choice for modeling energy management in smart residences due to its ability to capture complex temporal dependencies and handle time series data. The use of dual-LSTMs implies having separate LSTM models for energy prediction and optimization. This approach allows for a clear separation between prediction and optimization tasks, enabling efficient modeling and management of energy resources in smart residences. Assumptions play a crucial role in any research or system development. In the case of an automated Multi-Energy Management System, some possible assumptions could be the availability of accurate and reliable historical energy consumption data. 2.4 Dataset The data collections Reference Energy Disaggregation Data Set (REDD) (Cao et al., 2020), Electricity Consumption & Occupancy (ECO) (Zhang et al., 2021), and Indian Dataset for Ambient Water and Energy (iAWE) (Chen, 2022), which are easily and online available, were utilized to appraise the proposed methodology provided in Section 2 since they contain low frequency samples from gathered data and individual power measurements from each device, respectively. Multiple datasets with various monitored homes are included in each of the three databases. The ECO-3 dataset, which only includes the aggregated signal and not contain the power consumption signals of individual appliances, was not used for the current evaluation from the ECO database dwellings. Instead, the ECO-1, ECO-2, and ECO-4\u20136 datasets were used. Additionally, because home 5\u2032s measurement length is much dumpier than that of the other datasets in the REDD database, house 5 was removed from the REDD database. The Table 3 shows the REDD dataset sample. The Fig. 6 shows the energy consumption of all the appliances of the smart residence on the same day at various times. The Fig. 7 shows the total energy consumption of the electronic appliances in the smart residence. While it may seem unconventional to apply Deep-Dual LSTM specifically for analyzing the total energy consumption of electronic appliances in a smart residence, we can explore the potential effectiveness of this approach. To utilize Deep-Dual LSTM for analyzing energy consumption, we would typically train the model on historical energy consumption data, considering factors such as appliance usage patterns, time of day, day of the week, and any other relevant features. The model would learn to capture complex dependencies and long-term temporal relationships within the data, making it suitable for time series analysis tasks. The Fig. 8 depicts the data distribution of the power consumption by various electronics appliances in a smart residence for two days 3 Result and discussion In our model, we begin by setting the starting values for the hyper parameters, which include the epochs, learning rate, momentum, and hidden layer size. The values of these hyper parameters, which are manually selected, are used to train our model. By utilizing these hyper parameters, we are able to attain superior results in terms of classification performance. The hidden layer size should be 20, and the learning rate should be 0.01. Momentum should be 0.5. Epochs should be 700. The model classified refrigerator_5 appliances well, scoring 0.9999 on F1. Its refrigerator_5 category positive forecasts were 99.85% accurate. The model accurately recognized 99.75% of positive samples for this category based on its recall value of 0.9975. The model scored 0.9985 in kitchen_outlets_7. Positive predictions were 99.72% correct with an accuracy value of 0.9972. The model accurately detected 99.65% of kitchen_outlets_7 positive samples with a recall value of 0.9965. For kitchen_outlets_8 appliances, the model scored 0.9823 F1. Positive predictions were 98.25% accurate according to the precision value of 0.9825. The model detected 98.60% of kitchen_outlets_8 positive samples with a recall value of 0.9860. The microwave_11 model scored 0.9880 on F1. The accuracy rating of 0.986 means 98.6% of positive predictions were accurate. The model properly detected 98.52% of microwave_11 positive samples with a recall value of 0.9852. The lighting_9 appliance model scored 0.9750 F1. Positive predictions were 97.6% accurate with a precision value of 0.9760. The model properly detected 97.23% of lighting_9 positive samples with a recall value of 0.9723. Both metrics for energy estimation and categorization are used to assess the model. The F1 score, precision, and recall measures are utilized in the latter group, whilst the mean absolute error (MAE), signal aggregate error (SAE), and estimate accuracy (EA) metrics are applied in the former. In Table 4 , they are described. The performance metrics F1 Score, Precision and Recall shown in the Fig. 9 and the classification accuracy is given in the Table 5 . The deep dual LSTM approach allows for the modeling and prediction of energy consumption for various appliances by training separate models for each appliance. By incorporating relevant features and historical energy usage patterns, these models can provide valuable insights and forecasts for optimizing energy usage, load management, and overall energy efficiency in residential or commercial settings. In Fig. 10 , a comparison of the accuracy of energy consumption prediction for different sample appliances is presented. The results indicate that the prediction accuracy for lighting and the refrigerator is higher compared to the other appliances. However, it should be noted that the accuracy of the kitchen outlet prediction is the lowest among the appliances studied. The accuracy of prediction refers to how closely the model's estimated energy consumption aligns with the actual energy consumption of the appliances. A higher accuracy indicates that the model's predictions are more precise and reliable. In this case, the comparison suggests that the model performs particularly well in predicting the energy consumption of lighting and refrigerators. This could be attributed to several factors. Lighting appliances often have relatively stable and predictable energy usage patterns, making them easier to model accurately. Refrigerators, on the other hand, are essential household appliances with more consistent energy consumption profiles, allowing the model to capture and predict their usage patterns effectively. However, the kitchen outlet shows the lowest accuracy rate among the appliances studied. This implies that the model struggles to accurately predict the energy consumption of devices connected to the kitchen outlet. There could be various reasons for this lower accuracy. For example, the energy consumption of kitchen appliances connected to the outlet might be more variable or dependent on multiple factors, making it harder for the model to capture their patterns accurately. The comparison of accuracy among different appliances can provide valuable insights for further analysis and optimization. It can help identify areas where the model performs well and areas that require improvement. By understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the model's predictions for each appliance, researchers and developers can focus their efforts on refining the model or collecting additional data specific to the appliances with lower accuracy. When evaluating how well a deep learning model fits the training data, one metric that is utilised is called the training loss. In other words, it determines how inaccurate the model is by applying it to the training data and analysing the results. On the other hand, a deep learning model's performance on the validation set is evaluated using a statistic called validation loss. A section of the dataset known as the validation set has been set aside specifically for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of the model. The validation loss is determined from the sum of the errors for each sample in the validation set and is similar to the training loss. The Fig. 11 depicts these training and the validation loss of our model. The Fig. 12 shows the actual and the predicted energy of the appliance refrigerator on the specific day. To predict the energy consumption of a refrigerator on a specific day, you would typically provide the model with input data for that day, including the previous energy consumption values, time of day, temperature, and any other relevant features. The model then generates a prediction for the energy consumption of the refrigerator based on the learned patterns from the training data. The findings indicate that the suggested LSTM models achieve a very good performance in terms of both classification and prediction of the power consumption of each item. Because the assessment criteria are ambiguous and depend on the context and the data utilized for each experiment, a direct comparison with the work of the literature is not possible. As a comparison of our strategy to the state-of-the-art, Table 6 is provided as evidence. In comparison to (Kelly & Knottenbelt, 2015) and (Marulli & Visaggio, 2019; Kelly & Knottenbelt, 2015)'s work, which simply utilized active power, the proposed technique performs better in terms of f1 score. The Fig. 13 shows the performance comparison of the different model proposed by the previous researchers. From the figure it is clearly undestood that the proposed model achieves te robust result in maintaing the energy in the smart home environment. Deep-Dual LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is a recurrent neural network architecture that can be effective in energy management forecasting in an intelligent home environment. LSTM networks are known for capturing long-term dependencies and handling sequential data, making them suitable for time series forecasting tasks like energy management. In the context of a smart home environment, energy management forecasting involves predicting future energy consumption or generation based on historical data and other relevant factors. Deep-Dual LSTM can help in this process by learning patterns and dependencies in the data, allowing it to make accurate predictions. There are some aspects of uncertainty that may be present in the context of this paper. The system relies on data from various sensors to monitor and control energy consumption within smart residences. However, these sensors may introduce uncertainties due to limitations in accuracy, calibration, or potential measurement errors. The system needs to account for and mitigate such uncertainties. The input data used by the system, such as energy consumption patterns, weather conditions, or occupancy information, may exhibit variability over time. Uncertainties arise when the system attempts to predict and optimize energy management based on these variable inputs, as they may deviate from the expected patterns. The development of the Deep Dual-LSTM model and the overall energy management system involves making assumptions about the underlying processes, relationships, and behaviors of the energy system within smart residences. These assumptions introduce uncertainties, as they may not perfectly align with the real-world complexities of the system. 4 Conclusion In this paper, a unique intelligent IoT-edge framework based Deep dual Long Short-Term Memory is presented. The system encourages efficient Energy Management in smart cities. An innovative Deep Learning architecture known as Deep Dual Long Short-Term Memory is presented here to integrate the spatial and temporal learning power to predict energy consumption. An objective comparative analysis performed on publicly available data sets demonstrates that the Proposed Deep Dual- Long Short-Term Memory is more robust than the most recent cutting-edge methods. In order to forecast the potential energy needs, which are then submitted as a request to cloud servers interfacing with the smart grid, the trained Deep Dual- Long Short-Term Memory can be deployed on resource-constrained IoT devices (i.e., edge node). As a result, the smart grid connects to a cloud server in order to supply the various smart city sectors with the required amounts of electricity. Future work can be done in several ways to enhance our current effort. Training and assessing our model is expected to integrate more complicated and noisy features (environmental features, user behavioral features, etc.). Second, decentralized, distributed, or federated training may be examined to overcome the enlarging distance between various data sources caused by the constant growth in data volume.

        "dc:description": "The increasing popularity of home automation and the rising global electricity costs have emphasized the importance of energy conservation for consumers. With smart meters, machine learning models can anticipate equipment behavior by monitoring and recording residential power use. Multi-Energy Management Systems, which allow smart grid flexibility, have garnered interest. Smart meters and smart energy gadgets in homes require autonomous multi-energy management systems. These systems should efficiently utilize real-time data to plan device consumption, reducing costs for end users. The model incorporates two Long Short-Term Memory networks, capturing short-term and long-term dependencies in energy consumption patterns. This enables the Multi-Energy Management Systems to make accurate predictions and manage energy resources in real-time. The primary objectives are to minimize reliance on the grid and maximize the utilization of renewable energy sources. The proposed Deep Dual- Long Short-Term Memory model achieves impressive accuracy rates, with scores ranging from 97% to 99% for recall, F1-score, and precision. Numerical findings demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method compared to existing approaches, showcasing its ability to lower energy consumption and meet operational constraints. The results indicate that the proposed strategy optimizes energy use, providing cost savings and satisfying user requirements.",
