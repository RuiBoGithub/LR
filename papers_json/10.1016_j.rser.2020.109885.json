10.1016/j.rser.2020.109885 Elsevier Ltd Fig. 1 Application of the CPA model for distinguishing the different set-point temperatures in the large office space (for the case of August 15, 2017). Fig. 1 Fig. 2 The time-series indoor temperature and CO2 concentration in the large office space (for the case of Sep. 25, 2017). \u2022 Operation duration of the HVAC system (ODH): This index can be calculated by considering the variation of indoor temperature as a proxy indicator (refer to the orange-colored solid line in Fig. 2). The indoor temperature started to decrease for more than 30 min since 9:00 a.m., and it has been kept below 22.5 °C until 10:00 a.m. Then, it started to increase for more than 30 min since 10:00 a.m.; but it has been kept below 22.5 °C until 13:00 p.m. After that, it started to decrease for more than 30 min since 13:00 p.m., and it has been kept below 22.5 °C until 18:00 p.m. Finally, it started to increase since 18:00 p.m. In short, the HVAC system could be regarded as being operated from 9:00 a.m. through 18:00 p.m. (refer to the black-colored solid arrow line in Fig. 2); and thus, the ODH can be calculated as 9.0 h. \u2022 Duration of meeting (DM): As a proxy indicator, this index can be calculated by investigating the variations of CO2 concentration. As shown in Fig. 2 (blue-colored shared area), it could be assumed to have meetings in three time periods: (i) from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. (3 h); (ii) from 14:00 p.m. to 16:00 p.m. (2 h); and (iii) from 17:30 p.m. to 18:00 p.m. (0.5 h). Thus, the DM can be calculated as 5.5 h. \u2022 Effective utilization ratio of the HVAC system (EURH): This index can be determined by considering the ODH and DM (refer to Equation (2)). The less the EURH would be, the more energy would be wasted (i.e. larger potential of the energy efficiency improvement of the HVAC system). If the EURH would be at 100%, the HVAC system would be regarded to be operated only during the meeting periods, indicating that it would be most effectively operated without any waste. As a result, the EURH can be calculated at 61.11% (= 5.5 h/9.0 h) by considering two values (i.e. ODH and DM). \u2022 Accumulated effective utilization ratio of the HVAC system (AEURH): This index can be calculated from a macro perspective (refer to Equation (3)). By accumulating the values of the ODH and DM, the accumulated operation duration of the HVAC system (AODH) and the accumulated duration of meeting (ADM) can be obtained, respectively. With these values, the AEURH can be calculated (e.g., 40.29% (= 213.25 h/529.25 h)), indicating a large potential of the energy efficiency improvement of the HVAC system in the large office space (e.g., 59.71%).

Since a traditional centralized control system (e.g., building energy management system) with a fixed schedule and manual control is not appropriate to irregularly occupied rooms, it is expected to have a large amount of energy saving potential in operating the HVAC system. To overcome this challenge, this study aimed to develop a novel operation approach for the energy efficiency improvement of the HVAC system in office spaces. The real-time indoor environmental indicators were collected and analyzed to evaluate the current operation status of the HVAC system as well as to propose a novel control strategy in two ways. The significant findings can be illustrated as follows. First, it could be stated that occupants would tend to establish a lower set-point temperature for a cooler indoor environment. To solve this issue, a basic control strategy was proposed to detect the anomaly detection of the HVAC system and to automatically adjust the indoor temperature within a preferred range. Second, it could be evaluated that the HVAC system would be kept operating since occupants would forget to turn off the HVAC system after the meetings. To solve this issue, an advanced control strategy was proposed to operate the automatic on/off control of the HVAC system by considering the indoor temperature and CO2 concentration in real time. The proposed strategies can contribute to a large amount of energy savings in operating the HVAC system of irregularly occupied spaces.

It is reported that 20\u201340% of the national energy consumption come from the building sector, and especially for Hong Kong, the proportion is over 60% in which a commercial sector accounts for more than half [2,3]. The heating, ventilating and air-conditioning (HVAC) system is widely operated in buildings to keep a comfortable indoor environment, and its energy consumption is estimated to take up the largest proportion (i.e. 25%) of the total energy usages [3]. Thus, there is a large amount of energy saving potential in operating the HVAC system of office buildings. The HVAC system is generally controlled by the centralized building energy management system (BEMS) [4], which regulates the operation schedule (e.g., on/off condition), the set-point temperature and volume, regardless of the different characteristics of office spaces. However, it is required to control the HVAC system depending on the different types of spaces (e.g., irregular occupied offices). Reportedly, it is estimated to achieve the energy savings by over 20% by carefully establishing the set-points and the operation schedules of the HVAC system [5]. Therefore, this study aimed to improve the energy efficiency of the HVAC system in office spaces by deploying the optimal operation strategies. The low-cost sensors and cloud servers have become more accessible due to the rapid growth in the Internet-of-Things (IoT) industry [6,7]. Accordingly, the real-time data opens new opportunities with the valuable information hidden behind, and it can be effectively used with the advanced computing algorithms and technologies. In this context, there are a growing number of studies on the energy efficiency improvement in buildings through real-time big data analytics, such as pattern recognition [8\u201313], anomaly detection [14\u201317], model predictive control [18\u201321]. Tables 1 and 2 summarize previous studies on the real-time energy efficiency improvement by adjusting the set-point temperature of the HVAC system and by deploying the occupancy-based control of the HVAC system. First, the set-point temperature of the of HVAC system is generally used to maintain the indoor temperature within a preferred range. As shown in Table 1, many previous studies have proved that the significant energy-saving potential could be achieved by appropriately establishing the set-point temperature of the HVAC system. Ghahramani et al. [22] analyzed the impact of the set-point temperature, dead band, and occupancy schedule on energy-saving potential via energy simulation. Compared to the annual set-point temperature (i.e. 22.5 °C), the daily set-point temperature (i.e. 19.5\u201325.5 °C) can save energy by 6.78%\u201337.03% depending on different climates and building size. Hoyt et al. [23] suggested to increase the cooling set-point temperature from 22.2 °C to 25 °C so that the energy savings can be achieved by 29%. Both of simulations and field studies supported that adequate set-point temperature was beneficial in terms of energy savings. Second, the discrepancies between the designed and actual energy usage can mainly occur due to the occupants' behaviors. Significant energy saving potential could be achieved if building services would effectively respond to occupancy condition. As shown in Table 2, many previous studies have made efforts in developing the occupancy-based control strategies. Labeodan et al. [24] installed the wireless sensors and actuators to facilitate the occupancy-based lighting control, in which passive infrared motion sensors and chair sensors were used to determine the occupants' presence or absence. Wang et al. [25] established the occupancy-based ventilation strategy for multi-zone spaces via Wi-Fi network. Compared to the traditional method with a fixed outdoor air ratio, the proposed strategy determined the proper outdoor air ratio depending on the detected and predicted occupancy level. Although several studies have been conducted for the energy efficiency improvement by investigating the set-point temperature and occupancy-based control in real time, there were two kinds of challenges to be overcome. On one hand, previous studies tried to achieve the energy savings by developing the thermostat of the HVAC system, based on the assumption that the actual indoor temperature would reach the designated set-point temperature. However, it could be acceptable only if the HVAC system is operated in normal condition. That is, considering the accidental failures of the HVAC system (e.g. biases of temperature sensor inside, control signal errors, etc.), the designated set-point temperature of the HVAC system would not be met under the stable condition. Therefore, it is needed to accurately estimate the set-point temperature with a concept of dead band instead of utilizing the value shown in a control panel. On the other hand, previous studies tried to achieve the energy savings with the occupancy-based control strategies by using passive infrared sensors, cameras, Wi-Fi signals, and so on. However, these methods could cause the high costs and privacy issues. Therefore, alternative ways that are cheaper and unconcerned of privacy issues should be considered to develop the occupancy-based control strategies for the HVAC system. To address the aforementioned challenges, a novel operation approach was developed to improve the energy efficiency of the HVAC system in office spaces through real-time big data analytics. First, the set-point temperature of the HVAC system could be estimated by calculating the mean value of indoor temperature. One of the change point analysis (CPA) models was chosen to identify changes in the mean value of indoor temperature and to evaluate the current status of the set-point temperature in operating the HVAC system. The proposed model can detect the potential equipment failure in the HVAC system by estimating the set-point temperature in real time, and it can provide feedbacks to adjust the set-point temperature within a preferred range. On the other hand, the indoor environmental indicators were adopted to evaluate whether the HVAC system would be effectively operated and whether the office spaces would be occupied. Accordingly, it is expected to effectively operate the HVAC system by applying the real-time occupancy-based control strategy. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Research framework The previous studies, as a dynamic management approach in buildings, were conducted by the author [36,37] to achieve the improvement of the indoor environmental quality (IEQ). As shown in Supplementary Material (SM), Fig. S1, the dynamic management approach was adopted to achieve the energy efficiency improvement in office spaces by estimating the set-point temperature and by improving the effective utilization of the HVAC system in real time. This study established the research framework into three phases. (i) Monitoring phase (refer to section 2.2 ): The IoT-based sensors were installed to detect the indoor environmental quality in real time, in which temperature and CO2 concentration were considered. (ii) Diagnostic phase (refer to section 2.3 ): Based on the collected dataset, two types of diagnoses were conducted. First, the set-point temperature of the HVAC system was estimated to evaluate whether it has been maintained within a preferred range (for energy saving and thermal comfort). Second, the effective utilization of the HVAC system was evaluated by investigating whether the HVAC system was turned off after the meeting schedule, in which temperature and CO2 concentration were considered. (iii) Intervention phase (refer to section 2.4 ): Based on the diagnostic results, two types of intervention strategies were suggested. First, the set-point temperature of the HVAC system could be estimated to detect the possible equipment failure and to provide proper suggestions for energy saving and thermal comfort. Second, as an operation strategy, the shutdown of the HVAC system was suggested to avoid the unnecessary operation of the HVAC system when office spaces were not occupied; and thus, the effective utilization of the HVAC system could be achieved. 2.2 Monitoring phase The living-lab approach was adopted to collect the indoor environmental quality in office spaces, in which the qualified environmental sensors were used. As a spatial-temporal scope, this study targeted two office spaces (which were mainly used for a cooperative work in an irregular manner) in \u201cA\" office located in Hong Kong, and collected the real-time dataset in a summer season (from Jul. 31, 2017 to Sep. 30, 2017). . A centralized HVAC system was installed in \u201cA\" office, and it could be adjusted by occupants via a control panel. Accordingly, the set-point temperature and on/off condition of the HVAC system could be controlled in two ways. On one hand, a fixed operation schedule could be applied to the office spaces via the BEMS with the on/off condition of the HVAC system, indicating that it automatically turns on at 7:00am and turns off at 23:00pm. On the other hand, the HVAC system could be turned on/off by occupants and the relevant set-point temperature could be adjusted by their preference. The environmental sensors (AWAIR) can collect the environmental indicators, such as temperature, humidity, CO2 concentration in real time. The sensor collects the environmental data in 1-min interval; however, the data are automatically calculated to the 15-min averaged value in a cloud server. The previous study conducted by De Mauro et al. [38] defined a \u201cBig Data\u201d as a dataset characterized by high volume, high velocity and high variety. With the definition, the dataset collected in this study can be defined as a \u201cBig Data\u201d. The five kinds of indicators in two office spaces were investigated in a nearly real-time resolution (i.e. every 1 min). That is, it exactly corresponds to \u201cHigh Volume\u201d, \u201cHigh Velocity\u201d, and \u201cHigh Variety\u201d. It should be noted that temperature and CO2 concentration were mainly investigated to develop a novel operation approach for the energy efficiency improvement of the HVAC system in office spaces. Supplementary Material (SM), SM Table S1 shows the details of the specifications of the environmental sensor. 2.3 Diagnostic phase Since the HVAC system is generally installed to maintain a comfortable indoor environment in \u201cA\" office, the real-time environmental indicators were used to investigate the operation condition of the HVAC system and the potential of the energy efficiency improvement of the HVAC system. Considering the complexity of analysis methods (e.g. the number of indicators, the way how it is considered, etc.), this study diagnosed the current status of the energy efficiency of the HVAC system in two ways: (i) \u201cbasic analysis\u201d - the set-point temperature of the HVAC system in office spaces by considering the indoor temperature; and (ii) \u201cadvanced analysis\u201d - the effective utilization of the HVAC system in office spaces by considering the indoor temperature and CO2 concentration. 2.3.1 Basic analysis The occupants could adjust the set-point temperature of the HVAC system via the control panel. Regulations or standards in different climates were established for occupants to determine the set-point temperature of the HVAC system [27]. According to the \u201cGuidance Notes for the Management of Indoor Air Quality in Offices and Public Places\u201d [39] enacted by Hong Kong, the excellent class of indoor temperature is defined within a range of 20\u201325.5 °C, aiming to create a thermal comfort level of the indoor environment. Meanwhile, the \u201cEnergy Saving Charter 2017\" [40] launched by Environment Bureau in Hong Kong rather focuses on the energy-saving issue, appealing to maintain an averaged indoor temperature within a range of 24\u201326 °C in a summer season (i.e. from June to September). By thoroughly considering the aforementioned regulation standards, four classes of indoor temperature (i.e. Class 1-Class 4, divided by 20 °C, 24 °C, and 25.5 °C) were set in this study (refer to SM Table S2). Four ranges with different characteristics can be used to determine the set-point temperature of the HVAC system. \u2022 Class 1 (higher than 25.5 °C): This class could contribute to the energy saving in accordance with the regulation standard [40], but the thermal comfort requirement could not be met with the regulation standard [39]. That is, the energy saving could be achieved by turning off the HVAC system in summer; however, the temperature could not be satisfied with a thermal comfort level. \u2022 Class 2 (24\u201325.5 °C): This class could meet the regulation standards set by the government in Hong Kong [39,40] in terms of both of energy saving and thermal comfort issues. The set-point temperature of the HVAC system should be adjusted within a range of 24\u201325.5 °C as a preferred standard to simultaneously achieve two goals. \u2022 Class 3 (20\u201324 °C): This class could meet the thermal comfort requirement set by the government in Hong Kong [39]; however, the more energy would be consumed to keep the indoor temperature within a range of 20\u201324 °C (Class 3) compared to that of 24\u201325.5 °C (Class 2). This class (Class 3) is especially necessary and meaningful for such occupants as children, elderly, and patients, who are very sensitive to the indoor temperature. \u2022 Class 4 (lower than 20 °C): This class could meet neither the energy saving nor the thermal comfort issues. If the indoor temperature was set within a range of this class, occupants would feel cold, and potential problems (e.g. condensation [37]) could happen. In other words, more energy could be consumed without obtaining occupant\u2019 satisfaction. Thus, the set-point temperature below 20 °C should be avoided. Meanwhile, it is not available to record all the values from the control panels of the existing HVAC system. Also, the values displayed on the control panels could deviate from the actual value controlled by the HVAC system (i.e. performance gap) due to the equipment failure inside the HVAC system [41\u201343]. Also, the historical values of the set-point temperature of the HVAC system were not recorded. Thus, an alternative way was adopted to estimate the set-point temperature by using the real-time temperature data measured by the environmental sensors. In general, a dead band could occur by the relevant properties of equipment. For example, the relationship between the set-point temperature and the dead band in a cooling mode can be explained as follows: (i) if the indoor temperature reaches or exceeds the maximum temperature (which can be established at the set-point temperature plus a half of dead band), the HVAC system starts operating in a cooling mode and (ii) if the indoor temperature reaches or is below the minimum temperature (which can be established at the set-point temperature minus a half of dead band), the HVAC system stops operating. In this way, the HVAC system would be operated to maintain the indoor temperature within the dead band (refer to the blue dotted area in Fig. 1 ); and thus, the indoor temperature could be fluctuated around the set-point temperature. In this background, this study adopted an indirect way to calculate the averaged indoor temperature and regarded it as the set-point temperature of the HVAC system. Meanwhile, the CPA can be adopted to dividing time periods by considering the set-point temperatures of the HVAC system. The CPA is a univariate statistical analysis technique to detect the change in the statistical properties of a sequence of data [44]. The CPA has been applied in many fields, such as fault detection [16], occupancy estimation [45,46], and the financial exchange rate analysis [47]. The mean temperature was regarded as the set-point temperature of the HVAC system in the CPA model. The change point detection process can be illustrated as follows. The dataset on the indoor temperatures was collected in 15-min interval by the environmental sensors, and the default operation schedules of the HVAC systems in two office spaces were automatically controlled from 7:00 through 23:00. Thus, the 64 datasets of the indoor temperatures between 7:00 to 23:00 were used as inputs in the CPA model. Let the time-series data of the indoor temperatures and the data for each sampling time (15-min interval) denoted by T and Ti, respectively (where i = 1, 2, \u2026, 64). According to Equation (1), T was separated into different segments by considering the different change points (θ1, θ2, \u2026, θj) [45]. The adjacent segments can be featured with various statistical properties (i.e., the mean value of the indoor temperatures for 15-min interval). Among various CPA algorithms, this study adopted the \u201cchangepoint\u201d R package developed by Killick and Eckley [48\u201351]. The function (i.e. \u201ccpt.mean ()\") to identify the changes in mean values was chosen, in which the parameters were selected with the Schwartz information criterion (SIC) as a penalty and the power of the pruned exact linear time (PELT) as a method. (1) T = { T 1 ( i , w 1 ) + e 1 ( i ) , 1 ≤ i < θ 1 T 2 ( i , w 2 ) + e 2 ( i ) , θ 1 < i < θ 2 \u2026 \u2026 T j ( i , w j ) + e j ( i ) , θ j − 1 < i ≤ 64 where, Tk (i,wk) is the function to describe the statistical property of the kth segment; i is the sampling time; wk is the parameter vector; and ek(i) is the error term of the kth segment, k = 1, 2, \u2026, j. Fig. 1 shows an example of the CPA model in the large office space on Aug. 15, 2017. The indoor temperatures collected in 15-min interval between 7:00 to 23:00 were numbered in order from 1 to 64, and they were used as the inputs of the function \u201ccpt.mean ()\" in the \u201cchangepoint\u201d R package. After running the \u201cR\" programming language, the 11th data (i.e. temperature at 9:30) was identified as the change point; and thus, the dataset between 7:00 to 23:00 were divided into two segments: (i) 7:00\u20139:15 (the first segment) and (ii) 9:30\u201323:00 (the second segment). The mean value in the period of 7:00\u20139:15 (the first segment) and 9:30\u201323:00 (the second segment) were 27.13 °C and 20.00 °C, respectively. Since the set-point temperature of the HVAC system could be adjusted with the increment of 0.5 °C via its control panel, the calculated mean temperature should be rounded to the first decimal place with a value of 0 or 5 (e.g., from the calculated mean temperature of 27.13 °C to the rounded value of 27.0 °C). As explained earlier, there are four classes on the indoor temperature by considering the regulation standards set by the government in Hong Kong. Assuming that if the indoor temperature lies in Class 1 (i.e. higher than 25.5 °C), the HVAC system could be inferred to be turned off. If the indoor temperature lies in Class 3 (i.e. 20\u201324 °C), the level of thermal comfort could be satisfied, and the potential of energy savings could be more increased. In the example shown in Fig. 1, it could be inferred: (i) the HVAC system was not operated between 7:00\u20139:15 (the first segment); and (ii) the energy saving could be achieved if the set-point temperature between 9:30\u201323:00 (the second segment) would be increased to Class 2 (i.e. 24\u201325.5 °C). For the whole dataset from 31 Jul. through 30 Sep. in 2017, it can be found in SM Tables S3\u2013S4 (for small and large office spaces, respectively). 2.3.2 Advanced analysis Occupants can have an effect on the indoor environment in both ways: (i) passive way (e.g. heat generation, moisture generation, CO2 emission, and pollutant emission); and (ii) active way (e.g. controlling electronic equipment) [52]. To remove these artificial impacts and to maintain the indoor environmental indicators within a comfortable range, it is a reliable and essential way to operate the HVAC system in hot and humid regions, such as Hong Kong [53]. However, considering the gap between the amount of influence from occupants and the capacity of the HVAC system, it is not easy to identify the exact cause of the change in the indicators. The main features of the temperature and CO2 concentration in a cooling mode of the HVAC system can be explained as follows [54\u201358], and others (i.e., humidity, VOCs and micro dust) can be found in SM Table S6 [59\u201365]. \u2022 Temperature: Compared to the capacity of the HVAC system in a cooling mode, the increase in the indoor temperature by occupants' activities would be a negligible amount. Thus, the variation of the indoor temperature can be used as a proxy indicator to evaluate whether the HVAC system would be being operated. For example, if the indoor temperature would decrease for more than 30 min or be kept below 25.5 °C, it is assumed that the HVAC system would be operated; otherwise, it would be turned off.. \u2022 CO 2 concentration: When an office space is being occupied, the CO2 concentration would generally increase due to the metabolic process [54\u201356]. Even if the mechanical ventilation of the HVAC system is being operated so to bring a certain amount of fresh air, the CO2 emissions from occupants could evidently contribute to the increase in the CO2 concentration [57,58]. Thus, as a proxy indicator, the CO2 concentration can be adopted to evaluate whether the office spaces are being occupied. For example, if the CO2 concentration would increase for more than 30 min, an occupant would be regarded to have come into an office space (i.e. starting a meeting); otherwise, it would be regarded to have left an office space (i.e. finishing a meeting). By considering the real-time data of indoor temperature and CO2 concentration simultaneously, it is possible to judge whether the HVAC system would be effectively operated. If the HVAC system would be operated during a meeting, it would be meaningful to keep a comfortable environment. Otherwise, the HVAC system should be turned off so as to achieve the potential of the energy efficiency improvement of the HVAC system. Fig. 2 shows the time-series indoor temperature and CO2 concentration in the large office space on Sep. 25, 2017, illustrating the aforementioned evaluation process.where, EURH is the effective utilization ratio of the HVAC system (%); ODH is the operation duration of the HVAC system (hour); and DM is the duration of meeting (hour). (3) A E U R H = A D M A O D H where, AEURH is the accumulated effective utilization ratio of the HVAC system (%); AODH is the accumulated operation duration of the HVAC system (hour); and ADM is the accumulated duration of meeting (hour). 2.4 Intervention phase 2.4.1 Basic control strategy As explained in Section 2.3.1, the function \u201ccpt.mean ()\" in the \u201cchangepoint\u201d R package was adopted to estimate the set-point temperature of the HVAC system. On one hand, in case of reaching a lower set-point temperature, the indoor temperature would first decrease to the minimum limit of the corresponding set-point temperature (Tmin), and then it would fluctuate within a certain range between \u201cTmin\u201d and \u201cTmin plus dead band\u201d. That is, the basic concept for the real-time estimation of the lower set-point temperature of the HVAC system is to identify \u201cTmin\u201d and a certain temperature that lies between \u201cTmin\u201d and \u201cTmin plus dead band\u201d. On the other hand, in case of reaching a higher set-point temperature, the indoor temperature would first increase to the maximum limit of the corresponding set-point temperature (Tmax), and then it would fluctuate within a certain range between \u201cTmax\u201d and \u201cTmax minus dead band\u201d. That is, the basic concept for the real-time estimation of the higher set-point temperature of the HVAC system is to identify \u201cTmax\u201d and a certain temperature that lies between \u201cTmax\u201d and \u201cTmax minus dead band\". In short, a control strategy with the estimated set-point temperature of the HVAC system in real time can be developed for: (i) detecting the potential failures in the HVAC system and (ii) providing feedbacks on the adjustment of the set-point temperature within the preferred range (i.e. Class 2, 24\u201325.5 °C) if necessary. 2.4.2 Advanced control strategy For the office spaces with irregular occupancy schedule, it would be so difficult to pre-set the operation schedule of the HVAC system; and thus, the predictive control would not be applicable for the HVAC system in office spaces. In addition, the meeting attendees would seldom turn off the HVAC system after meeting; and thus, it would be unreliable to turn on/off the HVAC system in a manual way. In this regard, the real-time occupancy-based control strategy for the HVAC system in office spaces would be a promising way. According to Equations (2) and (3), the AEURH and EURH are in proportion to the ADM and DM; but in inversely proportion to the AODH and ODH. Since the ADM and DM would be difficult to be predicted and controlled, the AODH and ODH were determined as target parameters. That is, the HVAC system should be properly operated only during the meeting periods, and it should be turned off when there is no occupant. In this way, the AEURH and EURH could be optimized to the value of 100% (i.e. completely effective utilization of the HVAC system). In short, the occupancy-based control strategy would be a reactive control one, which could respond to the absence of occupants in real time by investigating the CO2 concentration. Further, this approach could consider the occupants\u2019 preference and behaviors, because it would be promised for the HVAC system to be operated during the meeting periods. 3 Results and discussion This study used the real-time indoor environmental indicators to analyze the potential of the energy efficiency improvement of the HVAC system in office spaces. The detailed analyses were conducted, and the relevant control strategies were developed in two ways. 3.1 Basic analysis and control 3.1.1 Basic analysis Fig. 3 shows the distribution of the indoor temperature in two office spaces in accordance with four classes set by the regulation standards in Hong Kong [39,40]. As explained in SM Table S2, four classes have different characteristics in terms of energy saving and thermal comfort, this study analyzed the distribution of the indoor temperature by class. \u2022 Class 1 (higher than 25.5 °C): The proportions were determined at 30.46% and 33.50% for the small and large office spaces. During the meetings, it is required to take the thermal comfort into account; and thus, an automatic control strategy should be adopted to turn on the HVAC system in a timely manner. \u2022 Class 2 (24\u201325.5 °C): The smallest proportions were determined at 17.08% and 6.87% for the small and large office spaces, indicating that it would be possible to simultaneously achieve both of energy saving and thermal comfort. \u2022 Class 3 (20\u201324 °C): The largest proportions were determined at 47.10% and 41.34% for the small and large office spaces, in which there would be huge potential for energy saving if the indoor temperature could be adjusted within the range of Class 2 (i.e. 24-25.5 °C), especially to the upper limit of Class 2 (i.e. 25.5 °C). In addition, thermal comfort would still be satisfied in this class. \u2022 Class 4 (lower than 20 °C): The proportions were determined at 5.36% and 18.29% for the small and large office spaces, indicating that the set-point temperature would be set at a very low level (especially for the large office space). This class should be entirely avoided because of uncomfortable cold feeling, energy waste, and dew condensation. Based on these analyses, it can be said that the indoor temperature needs to be properly maintained within the prescribed range so that both of energy saving and thermal comfort could be simultaneously managed. To do so, it is necessary to firstly understand the current status of the set-point temperature of the HVAC system. As shown in SM Tables S3\u2013S4, the set-point temperature of the HVAC system was estimated within a range of 19.5\u201327.5 °C for the small office space and 17.5\u201329.0 °C for the large office space. Also, Fig. 4 shows the frequency of the estimated set-point temperature of the HVAC system in two office spaces, in which the median value of the set-point temperature was calculated to clearly evaluate the skewness of the distribution. They were determined at 22.0 °C and 21.0 °C (which belonged to Class 3; 20\u201324 °C) for the small and large office spaces, indicating that occupants would tend to designate the lower set-point temperatures for a cooler indoor environment, and they would neglect the energy-saving aspect in two rooms. Therefore, it is required to achieve the energy savings by deploying a real-time automatic control process, which could estimate the set-point temperature of the HVAC system and adjust it to Class 2 (24\u201325.5 °C, especially to the upper limit of 25.5 °C) in a timely manner. 3.1.2 Basic control strategy Fig. 5 shows a logical flowchart for estimating the set-point temperature of the HVAC system in real time, which can be applied to (i) anomaly detection of the HVAC system and (ii) suggestion of the adjustment of the set-point temperature to the preferred range (e.g. Class 2 of 24\u201325.5 °C). A basic control strategy can be deployed in the following five steps. \u2022 (i) Judgement of whether the set-point temperature decreases: If the data declines from the initial sampling time (T(0)) through the first sampling time (T(1)), it results that the set-point temperature of the HVAC system could be regarded to decrease to a lower value for the last 15 min, and the step (ii-1) will be followed to estimate the set-point temperature in real time. Otherwise, the set-point temperature of the HVAC system could be regarded to increase to a higher value, and the step (ii-2) will be followed. \u2022 (ii-1/ii-2) Calculation of the mean value of the indoor temperature: Depending on the judgement in step (i), the way how the set-point temperature is estimated could be determined. The basic concept of step (ii-1) is to identify \u201cTmin\u201d and to calculate the mean value of temperatures that lie between \u201cTmin\u201d and \u201cTmin plus dead band\u201d. First, T(1) is initially set as \u201cTmin\u201d. As the sampling time increases, \u201cTmin\u201d will be replaced repeatedly by the temperatures lower than \u201cTmin\u201d (i.e. \u201cTmin candidates\u201d). As shown in Fig. 1, the dead band of the HVAC system was determined at 2 °C; and thus, the temperature between \u201cTmin\u201d and \u201cTmin + 2 °C\u2033 will be considered to calculate the mean value (\u201cTm\u201d). In the process, \u201ci\" is the cycle counter to count the sampling times; \u201cj\" is the cycle counter to count the number of stabilized data between \u201cTmin\u201d and \u201cTmin + 2 °C\"; and \u201ck\" is the cycle counter to count the number of \u201cTmin candidate\u201d. \u201cTmin\u201d could be determined in a cyclic process, in which the equality between i and k is used to evaluate whether to proceed to the next process. In other words, if the data collected in the current sampling time would be lower than \u201cTmin\u201d after the stabilization period of the indoor temperature (i.e. between \u201cTmin\u201d and \u201cTmin + 2 °C\u2033), it would replace \u201cTmin\u201d but not be treated as \u201cTmin candidate\u201d. This is because the indoor temperature should decrease to \u201cTmin\u201d directly after establishing the set-point temperature; and then, it would fluctuate within the dead band. As for the step (ii-2), the basic concept is to identify \u201cTmax\u201d and to calculate the mean value of temperatures that lie between \u201cTmax\u201d and \u201cTmax minus dead band\u201d, which is very similar to step (ii-1). \u2022 (iii) Estimation of the set-point temperature: If the number of stabilized data (\u201cj\") is no less than the value of 2, it indicates that the indoor temperature has been within the dead band (i.e., stabilized change) for at least 30 min. In this case, the mean value (\u201cTm\u201d), rounded to the first decimal place with the value of 0 or 5, would be regarded as the estimated set-point temperature of the HVAC system (\u201cTEs\"). \u2022 (iv) Anomaly detection of the HVAC system: The estimated set-point temperature (\u201cTEs\u201d) could be compared with the designated set-point temperature displayed on control panel (\u201cTs\u201d). If the difference between \u201cTEs\u201d and \u201cTs\u201d would be within a certain level (e.g. 0.5 °C), the HVAC system could be considered to be operated in a normal condition. Otherwise, it could be assumed to have any of equipment failures (e.g. bias of the measured data in a sensor, or signal errors) inside the HVAC system. In this case, it should be recommended to check and calibrate the working condition of the HVAC system. \u2022 (v) Suggestion of the adjustment of the set-point temperature: If the estimated set-point temperature (\u201cTEs\u201d) is maintained below a certain range, it could be recommended to adjust the set-point temperature within the range of 24\u201325.5 °C (e.g., Class 2). 3.2 Advanced analysis and control 3.2.1 Advanced analysis Table 3 and SM Table S5 show the \u201cadvanced analysis\u201d for the effective utilization of the HVAC system in two office spaces. Considering that the HVAC system is automatically operated by the BEMS, the shutdown periods (i.e. from 23:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. in working days as well as the whole day in holidays) were not included in calculating the ODH (refer to the third column in Table 3 and SM Table S5). For example, the HVAC system in the large office space would start to operate at 8:30 a.m. on 1 August, and it would be kept operating despite no meeting until the automatic shutdown by the BEMS at 23:00 p.m. in the same day. Then, the HVAC system would be turned on automatically by the BEMS at 7:00 a.m. in 2 August, and it would be kept despite no meeting until the manual turn-off at 14:15 p.m. in 2 August (refer to the shaded area of Table 3). As a result, the ODH was determined at 21.75 h, which was summed up by 14.5 h (from 8:30 a.m. to 23:00 p.m.) and 7.25 h (from 7:00 a.m. to 14:15 p.m.). The results can be described in detail from the different perspectives as follows: First, on the macro level, even if the AEURH would be determined at a very small value, it could be expected to have a large potential of the energy efficiency improvement of the HVAC system in two office spaces. In other words, the ADM and AODH were determined at 99.75 and 220.25 h for the small office space and at 214.25 and 531.5 h for the large office space. The large difference between the ADM and AODH indicates that the HVAC system would not be effectively operated in the office spaces. As a result, the AEURH was determined at 45.29% for the small office space and at 40.29% for the large office space. For the small office space, the amount of energy consumed by the HVAC system would be suitably used at a level of 45.29% to provide meeting attendees with a comfortable indoor temperature, while 54.71% of the energy consumption in a cooling mode would be wasted in an unoccupied room. For the large office space, only 40.29% of the cooling energy supplied by the HVAC system would be meaningful, and 59.71% could be potentially saved. Second, on the micro level, it was determined that the two office spaces would be irregularly occupied, and the HVAC system would not be timely controlled before and after the meetings, leading to energy waste. The detailed results were explained as follows. \u2022 The meeting schedule: Compared to a regularly occupied space in a normal nine-to-five working mode, the two office spaces were determined to be irregularly occupied. Thus, it would be very difficult to define the meeting schedule and to set up the designated operation schedule of the HVAC system in advance. \u2022 The operation of the HVAC system in office spaces: Since the HVAC system in an office space could be controlled in a manual mode, it would be often excessively operated so that a large amount of cooling energy could be wasted. As shown in Table 3 and SM Table S5, in most of cases, the DM was evidently smaller than the ODH, of which ratio (i.e. EURH) was ranged between 16.00 and 58.62% for the small office space and 26.79\u201366.67% for the large office space. It means that the meeting attendees would forget turning off the HVAC system and make it continue to work for a long period after the meeting. As a result, the HVAC system has not been properly operated, indicating that 41.38\u201384.00% and 33.33\u201373.21% of energy consumption by the HVAC system would be wasted in the small and large office spaces despite no person in there. Therefore, considering the accumulated value (i.e. AEURH) or individual value (i.e. EURH) in two office spaces, it is possible to achieve a large potential of the energy efficiency improvement of the HVAC system. To do so, the automatic control strategy for the real-time occupancy-based shutdown control of the HVAC system can be implemented. 3.2.2 Advanced control strategy Fig. 6 shows a logical flowchart for the automatic on/off control of the HVAC system in real time, which can be applied to improve the effective utilization of the HVAC system. The main concept is to timely turn off the HVAC system after the meeting by considering the CO2 concentration. An advanced control strategy can be deployed in the following five steps. \u2022 (i) Data collection: As shown in SM Table S1 (specifications of the indoor environmental sensor), the dataset collected in 1-min interval on the CO2 concentration (\u201cCO2 (i)\") and indoor temperature (\u201cT (i)\") can be used to develop the advanced control strategy, in which \u201ci\" is the cycle counter to count the sampling times. \u2022 (ii) Judgment of whether the CO 2 concentration decreases: If the CO2 concentration would decrease for 1 min, step (iii) will be conducted. Otherwise, the process will be restarted for the first step. \u2022 (iii) Judgment of whether the indoor temperature decreases or keeps at a low level: If the indoor temperature would be below 25.5 °C (i.e., the upper limit of Class 2), the indoor temperature would be kept at a low level. If the aforementioned condition would happen, step (iv) will be conducted. Otherwise, the process will be restarted for the first step. \u2022 (iv) Judgment of whether the HVAC system keeps operating after the meeting: This step could be conducted only when the conditions in steps (ii) and (iii) could be satisfied. It means that the CO2 concentration would decrease for 15 min and the indoor temperature would decrease or be kept at a low level for 15 min. That is, it can be judged that the HVAC system would keep operating after the meetings. In this case, step (v) will be conducted. Otherwise, the process will be restarted for the first step. \u2022 (v) Automatic on/off control of the HVAC system: This step would be conducted only when the conditions in step (iv) could be satisfied, indicating that occupants would forget to turn off the HVAC system and the HVAC system should be turned off automatically. 3.3 Discussion The real-time automatic control strategies proposed in this study can be utilized in connection with renewable and sustainable energy systems in buildings as follows. \u2022 Demand response: The basic control strategy can be linked to the demand response program in buildings. That is, it is possible to control the set-point temperature of the HVAC system in more accurate manner so as to avoid the peak load at a specific point in time. Through this approach, it is expected to create an opportunity to receive incentives from the government according to demand response program. \u2022 Distributed generation system: The advanced control strategy can be linked to the distributed generation system in buildings. That is, irregularly occupied space (e.g., meeting room) can be connected to distributed generation systems (e.g. building-integrated photovoltaic, fuel cell, etc.), which provides energy to a space once it is occupied. Also, the potential energy savings can be utilized to operate a fuel cell system. Meanwhile, the following issues can be treated to further improve the proposed real-time automatic control strategies in the follow-up studies. \u2022 Basic control strategy: It is needed to consider the subjective perception of occupants and the adaptability to other districts with more comprehensive classes. Also, it is required to determine the threshold level of the number of stabilized data (\u201cj\") in step (iii) of Fig. 5 as well as the threshold level of difference between the estimated set-point temperature (\u201cTEs\u201d) and the designated one displayed on control panel (\u201cTs\u201d) in step (iv) of Fig. 5. \u2022 Advanced control strategy: To further improve the accuracy of the automatic on/off control of the HVAC system, it is suggested to determine the threshold level of the low temperature level in step (iii) of Fig. 6 and the cycle counter value (i) in step (iv) of Fig. 6 by considering the project characteristics and the relevant properties and by calibrating the control strategy with the ground truth. 4 Conclusions This study aimed to develop a novel operation approach for the energy efficiency improvement of the HVAC system in office spaces, in which the real-time big data analytics were adopted. The living-lab approach was used to conduct the field measurement for two office spaces (i.e. the large and small office spaces) in \u201cA\" office located in Hong Kong from 31 Jul. through 30 Sep. in 2017. The real-time indoor environmental indicators were used to analyze the current operation status of the HVAC system and to propose the automatic control strategies in the following two ways. (i) Basic control strategy: The set-point temperature of the HVAC system was estimated by the CPA model that could identify the mean value of the indoor temperature in real time. Then, the median value of the estimated set-point temperature was calculated to clearly evaluate the skewness of the distribution, resulting at 22.0 °C and 21.0 °C for the small and large office spaces, respectively. It could be stated that occupants would tend to set up the lower set-point temperatures for a cooler indoor environment, indicating that a large amount of cooling energy could be wasted. To solve this problem, this study proposed a logical control strategy for estimating the set-point temperature of the HVAC system in real time, which can be used to conduct the anomaly detection of the HVAC system and to automatically adjust the set-point temperature within a preferred range. (ii) Advanced control strategy: The effective utilization level of the HVAC system was evaluated by comparing the meeting schedule and the operation of the HVAC system in office spaces. On a macro level, the accumulated effective utilization ratio of the HVAC system (AEURH) was determined at 45.29% for the small office space and at 40.29% for the large office space, indicating that 54.71% of the cool energy consumption for the small office space would be wasted in an unoccupied mode; and 59.71% for the large office space. That is, it could be judged that the HVAC system would be kept operating since occupants would forget to turn off the HVAC system after the meetings. To solve this problem, this study proposed a logical control strategy for the automatic on/off control of the HVAC system in real time, which can be used to timely turn off the HVAC system after the meetings by considering the variation of the temperature and CO2 concentration in real time In conclusion, this study can be a promising attempt for achieving the energy efficiency improvement of the HVAC system in irregularly occupied offices (i.e. office spaces) by utilizing real-time big data. Particularly, the occupancy in a room could be detected by the variation of the CO2 concentration in a non-intrusive manner. Furthermore, it is expected to have a large amount of energy saving potential by effectively operating the HVAC system in irregularly occupied rooms, where the traditional centralized control system (i.e. BEMS) with a fixed schedule and manual control mode would not be appropriate.

        "dc:description": "Since a traditional centralized control system (e.g., building energy management system) with a fixed schedule and manual control is not appropriate to irregularly occupied rooms, it is expected to have a large amount of energy saving potential in operating the HVAC system. To overcome this challenge, this study aimed to develop a novel operation approach for the energy efficiency improvement of the HVAC system in office spaces. The real-time indoor environmental indicators were collected and analyzed to evaluate the current operation status of the HVAC system as well as to propose a novel control strategy in two ways. The significant findings can be illustrated as follows. First, it could be stated that occupants would tend to establish a lower set-point temperature for a cooler indoor environment. To solve this issue, a basic control strategy was proposed to detect the anomaly detection of the HVAC system and to automatically adjust the indoor temperature within a preferred range. Second, it could be evaluated that the HVAC system would be kept operating since occupants would forget to turn off the HVAC system after the meetings. To solve this issue, an advanced control strategy was proposed to operate the automatic on/off control of the HVAC system by considering the indoor temperature and CO2 concentration in real time. The proposed strategies can contribute to a large amount of energy savings in operating the HVAC system of irregularly occupied spaces.",
