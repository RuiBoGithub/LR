Accurate and prompt fault diagnosis of Air Handling Units is therefore critical. Although widely-used deep learning methods have shown high precision in fault diagnosis, they present two main drawbacks: 1) deep learning approaches are often \u201cblack box\u201d models lacking interpretability and rely on labeled data; 2) their complex structures entail substantial computational resources, which may not be conducive to timely fault diagnosis. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces a method for diagnosing faults in air handling units that combines a novel statistical process control strategy, a backpropagation multidimensional Taylor network fitter, and a D-matrix approach. The backpropagation multidimensional Taylor network, using a polynomial network with only one hidden layer, approximates nonlinear functions. Compared to deep learning models, it maintains high accuracy with a simpler structure, enabling rapid fault diagnosis. Additionally, the novel statistical process control strategy employs the Markov property for fault detection, characterized by low false alarm rates, interpretability, robustness, minimal labeled data requirements, and suitability for real-time monitoring. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our method in diagnosing faults in air handling units, achieving an average precision of 99.9%, surpassing several commonly used techniques.

They account for about 50% of the energy consumption in commercial buildings. Decreasing energy consumption in HVAC is a significant topic for researchers and several efforts were put into it. For instance, new lubricant was used in HVAC systems to increase performance and reduce energy waste [1]. A double diamond preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA) method is proposed and applied to designing AI functions for energy-efficient HVAC systems [2]. Different technologies for appropriate temperature set points were developed to improve energy efficiency [3\u20135]. System failure is also a considerable factor in energy waste, affecting the comfort of building occupants. If system abnormalities in HVAC are detected and acted upon at an early stage, human comfort needs can be met, energy consumption can be reduced, more serious consequences can be prevented, system operation can be improved, and maintenance and operation costs can be reduced. Therefore, fault diagnosis for HVAC is significant. As the key subsystem of the HVAC, the fault diagnosis of Air Handling Units (AHU) is of great help to the diagnosis process in HVAC. Fault diagnosis can be divided into two parts: fault detection and fault isolation. The main goal of fault detection is to identify abnormal events, which indicates that the current operation of the system deviates from the normal operating condition. Fault isolation is to determine the root cause of the detected abnormality. The detection of faults in systems can be broadly categorized into three categories: model-based, knowledge-based, and data-based. Model-based approaches, as the name suggests, involve the creation of an explicit model that describes the behavior of the system being monitored. Abnormal events are identified by comparing the actual process behavior with that estimated by the model [6]. However, this method can be challenging and time-consuming due to the intricate nature of modern systems. On the other hand, knowledge-based methods rely on pre-existing knowledge about the system and the expertise of specialists. For instance, in [7], an expert system was developed based on AHU fault diagnosis mechanisms and expert experience, while in [8], domain knowledge and data were seamlessly integrated to develop a data-driven fault detection model through machine learning. Although this method can be effective, it requires substantial investment in terms of time and resources to accumulate the necessary knowledge and experience. Recently, data-driven fault detection methods have gained significant popularity, especially in the context of complex industrial processes where models and knowledge are difficult to obtain. The rise of these methods can be attributed to the widespread use of distributed control systems that generate large amounts of data, and their ease of application, as they do not require in-depth system knowledge. Methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Autoencoder (AE), and Hidden Markov Models (HMM) have been utilized for fault diagnosis in HVAC and for monitoring various industrial processes [9,10]. Additionally, deep learning methods are widely used in fault diagnosis [11,12]. For instance, in [13], a one-dimensional convolutional neural network that provides interpretable results was proposed for HVAC fault diagnosis, overcoming the limitations of black-box deep learning models. In [14], a data augmentation and intelligent fault diagnosis method using ILoFGAN was proposed for planetary gearboxes under extremely limited samples. In [15], the digital twin-assisted deep transfer method was developed to diagnose faults in machinery. In [16], a deep neural network was created to forecast the thermal efficiency of air conditioning systems using silica gel as the desiccant material. Besides, combination technology has proved effective as well [17,18]. In [19], a fault detection and diagnosis process combining unsupervised learning and supervised data-driven approaches is proposed for transient and non-transient periods of AHU. In [20], A new hierarchical fault diagnosis method using Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) algorithm and association rule is specifically designed for variable refrigerant flow (VRF) systems. The advantage of purely data-driven fault diagnosis methods is that they can handle vast amounts of data in complex systems without the need for an in-depth understanding of the system's physical processes, often achieving high efficiency and precision in fault detection. However, the downside is that these methods are highly dependent on a large volume of high-quality data and typically lack model interpretability, which may result in insufficient generalization capabilities when facing unknown faults or changing operational conditions. Unlike the above purely data-driven machine learning approaches. Statistical Process Control (SPC)-based methods are also data-driven methods. However, it has several advantages as follows: 1) the SPC-based approach provides a clear explanation of the cause of the failure, which helps to understand the root cause of the failure, thus reducing the later troubleshooting efforts; 2) compared with machine learning-based methods, SPC methods are less sensitive to outliers in the data, and are therefore more robust and reliable; 3) SPC-based methods do not require labeled data, which is often a time-consuming and expensive process in machine learning-based methods; 4) SPC-based methods can be used for real-time monitoring of the process, allowing rapid detection and diagnosis of faults, and the severity of the occurrence of faults can be captured in real-time; and 5) SPC-based methods are typically simpler and faster than machine-learning-based methods. In contrast, machine learning-based methods may require significant computational resources and expertise to train and implement. For example, in [21,22], a simplified gray-box model based on physical principles was developed to estimate the fault-related variables in the model based on the Kalman Filter (KF), and fault detection was achieved by monitoring this variable through SPC methods. In [23], to dynamically monitor the state of the AHU, the real-time state of the AHU is obtained by a traceless KF and combined with SPC for fault detection. In contrast to the data-driven approach, the state monitoring by SPC provides real-time information about the severity of faults. In [24], to solve the difficulty of fault localization in HVAC systems, the coupled information is reduced using a hidden Markov model, after which the unscented KF and SPC approach is used for chiller unit fault diagnosis. In addition, SPC methods have been widely used in [25\u201327] for real-time fault diagnosis in injection wells, substations, and electric submersible pump wells. In summary, it is necessary to implement real-time fault diagnosis based on SPC methods in order to reduce the troubleshooting work. As mentioned earlier, to obtain the fault characteristics, the existing methods generally involve building a physical model. Considering that it is difficult and time-consuming to build an accurate model to describe all physical and chemical phenomena occurring. It is advisable to build a Multidimensional Taylor Network (MTN) model of the device to describe the dynamics of the fault characteristics. The MTN is a new type of network that can be used to fit multivariate functions. Unlike neural networks, the MTN is approximated by a polynomial network to a nonlinear function. Compared with neural networks, it has the following advantages: 1) The intermediate layer of MTN consists of polynomials containing only addition and multiplication, and the network structure is much simpler than most neural networks. Therefore, it has better real-time performance, and is easier to embed in control chips; 2) it has better fitting ability in the identification and prediction of nonlinear systems through the approximation of polynomial networks. Due to these two advantages, MTNs have been applied to tracking control of nonlinear systems, such as single-input single-output (SISO) [28\u201334], and large-scale stochastic nonlinear systems [35,36]. Experimental results in [37] show that MTN can be applied in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) nonlinear discrete-time systems, and its performance is stronger than that of traditional neural networks. In [38], A 3D data fitting method based on the BP-MTN model is proposed with advantages in the accuracy and efficiency of fitting nonlinear functions MTN can be used not only for function fitting but also for fault diagnosis. For example, in [39], an MTN classifier is developed for fault diagnosis of AHUs and proved superior to other widely used methods. In summary, this paper proposes a fault diagnosis method based on MTNs and a novel SPC method. The major contributions of this paper are as follows: \u2022 A novel SPC method is developed based on Markov property to detect faults with a low false alarm rate. \u2022 A novel fault diagnosis framework based on BP-MTN and Markov-based SPC is proposed for AHUs. \u2022 A D-matrix representing relationships between fault features and faults is established to isolate faults. An overview of the rest of this paper is shown below. Section 2 introduces some basic knowledge, including the structure of a typical AHU, and the structure and functions of a traditional MTN. Section 3 presents the fault diagnosis method based on a combination of BP-MTNs and a novel SPC method. Section 4 verifies the performance of the proposed diagnosis method through experiments. The experimental results show that the proposed method can accurately diagnose AHU faults. 2 Preliminary 2.1 The structure of a typical AHU AHU is used to regulate indoor air temperature, humidity, and cleanliness. It consists of several devices, as shown in Fig. 1 . These include the heating coil and the cooling coil for meeting heat and humidity treatment requirements of air, air filters for purifying air, mixing boxes for adjusting the ratio of fresh air to return air, various dampers for controlling air volume, and fans for raising air pressure for air supply and ventilation. Common failures include leakage of cooling coils, fan efficiency reduction, stuck dampers, etc. 2.2 The traditional MTN Traditional MTNs, commonly utilized for prediction purposes, employ a unique approach to describing the progression of a dynamic system. The input is in the same dimension as the output, as depicted in Fig. 2 . The system's input is represented by the state vector at time k, denoted as {x 1(k), x 2(k), \u2026, xI (k)}, while the output is comprised of the state vector at time k + 1, symbolized as {x 1(k + 1), x 2(k + 1), \u2026, xI (k + 1)}. Each output xi (k + 1), i = 1, \u2026, I, is associated with a data processing unit, Unit i. Unit i calculates the output xi (k + 1) through a polynomial combination of all inputs xi (k). The output xi (k + 1) is described as a weighted combination of a constant term and the Nth polynomial of input xi (k), i = 1, \u2026, I. Hence, the traditional MTN calculates the jth output through the following equation. (1) x j ( k + 1 ) = p j , 0 + ∑ n = 1 N ∑ c = 1 C n p j , n c ∏ i = 1 I x i a n , i ( k ) , j = 1 , \u2026 , I 3 A two-stage fault diagnosis method based on BP-MTN and a novel Markov-based SPC 3.1 The framework of the proposed method The framework of the AHU fault diagnosis method based on the BP-MTN and a novel SPC method is shown in Fig. 3 . As shown in this figure, the method has two stages, i.e., detecting faults and isolating faults. First, appropriate input and output variables are selected for each device based on physical mechanism, and then the corresponding BP-MTN is built to describe the relationship between input and output variables. The differences between estimates and actual values of output variables are considered fault features. Then, a novel SPC method is proposed to detect faults with low false alarm rates by judging whether K(t) consecutive data points jump out of their confidence intervals. After that, a D-matrix describing the relationship between faults and fault features is built to determine the diagnosability of faults and achieve fault diagnosis. 3.1.1 BP-MTN Traditional MTN networks have a drawback, in that they demand inputs and outputs that have identical dimensions, but this requirement often goes unmet in practical problems. To tackle this challenge, this paper presents a solution by adding a fully connected layer to the output layer, as demonstrated in Fig. 4 . This adaptation enables the network to accommodate inputs and outputs with different dimensions, overcoming the limitations of the conventional MTN network. In Fig. 4, ui (k) denotes the output of Uint i at time k. The difference between the actual value and the estimated value of some fault-related variables are considered fault features, so it needs to use a BP-MTN fitter to obtain the estimated value of fault-related variables. Because the sequence of fault-related variables has temporal characteristics, variables\u2019 values at time k-1, k-2\u2026 are used as input variables of BP-MTN to estimate the output of the BP-MTN at time k. Moreover, to enhance the fitting accuracy of the MTN, an activation function is added to the output node, represented by \u201cS\u201d in the figure. The output layer is designated as \u201czj (k)\u201d - where \u201cj\u201d represents the value of the jth output dimension at the time \u201ck\u201d, and is calculated by the equation specified as follows. (2) z j ( k ) = ∑ i = 1 I λ ij · S p i , 0 + ∑ n = 1 N ∑ c = 1 C n p i , n c ∏ i = 1 I x i a n , i ( k ) , j = 1 , 2 , ⋯ , J Our experiments have shown that the choice of activation function significantly impacts the fitting accuracy of BP-MTN for nonlinear functions. The selection of the activation function is discussed in subsection 4.2 in detail. 3.1.2 The BP-MTN learning algorithm To obtain the BP-MTN's weights, training is required through the use of a training dataset. The least squares method was traditionally applied in MTNs for weight estimation, but its computations involving matrix inversion can result in numerical instability. Considering the advantages of the Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) algorithm, including adaptive learning, momentum optimization, and regularization, it is employed to train the BP-MTN model. The Adam algorithm dynamically adjusts the learning rate, providing different rates for each parameter during various stages of training. This contributes to more effective convergence, particularly in scenarios with sparse or very large gradients. The training process of the BP-MTN is shown in Fig. 5 . In the figure, the magnitude of the training data is denoted as L, and each subset of data, extracted for gradient descent calculation, is referred to as Lbz . In each epoch of the training process, there are M = L/Lbz batches that are utilized. The objective of the network training is to reduce the error as represented by Eq. (3). (3) E m = 1 2 L bz ∑ l = 1 + L bz m - 1 L bz m [ z ( l ) - z ̂ ( l ) ] 2 , m = 1 , 2 , ⋯ , M The average error, Em , produced by the mth batch data is passed forward, layer by layer, using the chain rule, from the fully connected layer to the hidden layer, and finally to the input layer. The weight update equation can be represented as follows. (4) λ ij \u2032 = λ ij + α · ∂ E m ∂ λ ij , i = 1 , 2 , ⋯ , I ; j = 1 , 2 , ⋯ , J p i , n c \u2032 = p i , n c + α · ∂ E m ∂ p i , n c , i = 1 , 2 , ⋯ , I ; n = 1 , 2 , \u2026 , N ; c = 1 , 2 , \u2026 , C N 3.1.3 BP-MTN model of AHU devices This paper considers nine faults of AHUs. These faults are associated with each of the three AHU devices: the cooling coil, the return fan, and the mixing box. The procedure for establishing BP-MTN models of the devices is shown in Fig. 6 . As shown in the figure, when faults occur in different devices, they cause changes in variables associated with the faults. For example, a fault in the cooling coil may result in a decrease in heat exchange efficiency, leading to excessively high supply air temperature after passing through the cooling coil, which fails to meet the comfort requirements of occupants. Therefore, the temperature difference δ ta can be considered as a fault-related variable. Similarly, due to the reduced heat exchange efficiency, the temperature difference δ tchw may remain small, making it a potential fault feature. When a fault occurs in the return air fan, more power consumption may be needed to maintain the same air supply volume. Therefore, Qrf can be considered as a fault feature. Similarly, a fan fault may cause a decrease in the pressure rise of the return air fan PRrf , and it is also considered as a fault feature. When a fault occurs in the outdoor air damper, affecting the fresh air volume, R ma changes and serves as a fault feature. In addition, some control variables can directly reflect the effects of faults and are selected as fault features. For instance, θvlv,CC . When the valve of the cooling coil is stuck in a certain position, this variable will maintain a corresponding value. Therefore, it can be used to differentiate fault types and is considered as a fault feature. Similarly, θOA,dmp is also selected as a fault feature. To capture the temporal characteristics of the data, BP-MTNs of these fault-related variables are established separately. Each BP-MTN corresponds to one variable, and the input for each model includes the values of the variable from the past three time steps, with the output being the value of the variable at the current time step. The model inputs and outputs are summarized in Table 1 . The estimated values of the feature variables can be obtained based on the BP-MTN models established above. The differences between the estimated and actual values of the model outputs are around 0 under normal conditions, but they may deviate from 0 when faults occur. The differences can reflect fault impacts, and thus are considered as fault features. For instance, the fault feature Δ Q rf is (5) Δ Q rf = Q rf - Q ^ rf The actual and estimated values of Qrf are shown in Fig. 7 (a). Similarly, the actual values and estimated values of Δ T a are shown in Fig. 7(b). The differences between the actual and estimated values of Orf and those of Δ T a are shown in Fig. 7(c), and (d), respectively. 3.2 A novel SPC method for fault detection As discussed above, we can establish eight fault features. To determine whether these fault features deviate from 0, we decided to use Shewhart control charts [40]. The reason we use the Shewhart control chart for fault detection is that it can promptly detect abnormal situations, is designed based on statistical principles, and is easy to use. Its use helps us identify early signs of faults on time, ensuring system stability and maintaining normalcy through continuous monitoring of system status. The traditional Shewhart control chart starts by establishing the Upper Control Limit (UCL) and the Lower Control Limit (LCL) of the differences between the estimated values of the fault features and their actual values. When the difference exceeds the defined control interval [LCL, UCL], an anomaly can be considered to have occurred. However, considering that not only faults but also model errors and measurement errors can cause such occurrences, the conventional method leads to a relatively high false alarm rate. To solve this problem, a novel SPC method is proposed. The core idea of this method is shown in Fig. 8 . In this method, we calculate the probability P A ¯ j , A ¯ j + 1 , \u2026 , A ¯ j + K - 1 that K consecutive points jump out of their corresponding confidence interval [LCLj , UCLj ], i = j, \u2026, j + K-1, where the event that the data point at time j exceeds the defined control limits [LCLj , UCLj ] is defined as A ¯ j . A fault can be considered to have occurred only when P A ¯ j , A ¯ j + 1 , \u2026 , A ¯ j + K - 1 is less than 0.01 but the event that K consecutive points jump out of the confidence interval still occurs. It is useful to assume that the time series has Markov Property in calculating the probability of jumping out of the confidence interval at multiple consecutive points. That is, the conditional probability distribution of its future state depends only on the current state. In other words, given the present state, it is conditionally independent of the past state. Therefore, it can be obtained that the probability of jumping out of the confidence interval at K consecutive points from time j can be calculated according to the following equation. (6) P A ¯ j , A ¯ j + 1 , \u2026 , A ¯ j + K - 1 = P A ¯ j P A ¯ j + 1 | A ¯ j ⋯ P A ¯ j + K - 1 | A ¯ j + K - 2 Then when the data point at time j-1 exceeds its confidence interval, the probability that the data point at time j also exceeds its confidence interval is P A ¯ j | A ¯ j - 1 . This probability can be calculated according to the following equation. (7) P A ¯ j | A ¯ j - 1 = P A ¯ j , A ¯ j - 1 P A ¯ j - 1 = 1 - P A j , A ¯ j - 1 - P A ¯ j , A j - 1 - P A j , A j - 1 1 - P A j - 1 = 1 - P A j - P A j , A j - 1 - P A j - 1 - P A j - 1 , A j - P A j , A j - 1 1 - P A j - 1 = 1 - P A j + P A j , A j - 1 - P A j - 1 + P A j - 1 , A j - P A j , A j - 1 1 - P A j - 1 = 1 - P A j + P A j , A j - 1 - P A j - 1 1 - P A j - 1 Let the data points at time j-1 obey the distribution of N(μj -1, σj -1), while the data points at time j obey the distribution of N(μj , σj ). Then the probability that the data point at time j-1 does not jump out of its confidence interval is given as: (8) P A j - 1 = ∫ LC L j - 1 UC L j - 1 1 2 π σ j - 1 e - y - μ j - 1 2 2 σ j - 1 2 d y Similarly, the probability that the data point at time j does not jump out of its confidence interval is given as: (9) P A j = ∫ LC L j UC L j 1 2 π σ j e - x - μ j 2 2 σ j 2 d x Additionally, the probability that both the data point at time j-1 and that at time j do not jump out their corresponding confidence intervals is given as: (10) P A j - 1 , A j = P x j ∈ LC L j , U C L j x j - 1 ∈ LC L j - 1 , U C L j - 1 = ∫ LC L j UC L j ∫ LC L j - 1 UC L j - 1 1 2 π σ j - 1 e - y - μ j - 1 2 2 σ j - 1 2 d y 1 2 π σ j e - x - μ j 2 2 σ j 2 d x The key to calculating the integrals above is how to obtain μj -1, σj -1, μj , σj , LCLj -1, UCLj -1, LCLj , and UCLj . To address this issue, LCLj , UCLj are generated based on the L points before the current point. For instance, the mean and the standard deviation of the previous L points at time j are (11) μ ¯ j = 1 L ∑ l = j - L j - 1 x l , (12) σ ¯ j = 1 L - 1 ∑ l = j - L j - 1 x l - μ ¯ j , 3-sigma is used as the confidence interval, so the upper and lower bounds are LC L j = μ j ¯ - 3 σ j ¯ and UC L j = μ j ¯ + 3 σ j ¯ , respectively. Similarly, the upper and lower bounds LCLj -1 and UCLj -1 are generated based on the current point and the previous L-1 points. Additionally, it is reasonable to take an approximate approach when finding μj -1, σj -1, μj , σj , i.e., the distribution followed by the data point at the current time. For example, at time j, it may be reasonable to assume that the normal distribution N(μj , σj ) followed by the current data point is determined by the distribution N ( μ j ¯ , σ j ¯ ) of the previous L points, i.e., μ j = μ j ¯ and σ j = σ j ¯ . Substituting these values into Eqs. (9)\u2013(11), P(Aj -1), P(Aj ) and P(Aj -1, Aj ) can be calculated. Subsequently, the probability P A j ¯ | A j - 1 ¯ can be calculated based on Eq. (8). Similarly, P A j + 1 ¯ | A j ¯ 、 P A j + K - 1 ¯ | A j + K - 2 ¯ can also be calculated. By substituting these values into Eq. (7), the probability of jumping out of the confidence interval for K consecutive points is calculated. To make the false alarm rate lower than 0.01, K* that satisfies the following equation is used as the basis for determining the occurrence of the fault. (13) K ∗ = arg max K P A ¯ j , A ¯ j + 1 , \u2026 , A ¯ j + K - 1 < 0.01 K That is, when K* consecutive points jump out of the confidence interval, the fault can be considered to have occurred; otherwise if less than K* consecutive points jump out of the confidence interval, these points that jump out of the confidence interval are treated as false alarms. 3.3 A D-matrix for fault diagnosis HVAC AHU is a complex system where the equipment is coupled together by air and water flows. Therefore, the selected fault features are interrelated. The fault features selected in subsection 3.2 may be related to faults in multiple pieces of equipment, and a fault in one piece of equipment may cause multiple fault features to behave abnormally. For instance, the process of fault detection using the Δ Q rf is shown in Fig. 9 . (a). Q ^ rf is obtained using the BP-MTN based on data under normal conditions. In the figure, the Q ^ rf , the lower and the upper limits of its confidence interval are represented by yellow, red, and blue lines, respectively. It can be seen from the figure that the values of Δ Q rf under normal conditions are generally within the confidence interval, but due to model errors or measurement noise, a small number of points have also jumped out of the confidence interval. Fig. 9(b) shows the values of Δ Q rf under the f 1 fault. It can be found that all points fall outside the confidence interval, indicating that Δ Q rf is more sensitive to the f 1 fault. Fig. 9(c) shows the values of Δ Q rf under the f 2 fault. It can be seen that most of the points of Δ Q rf are within the confidence interval, so Δ Q rf is not sensitive to the f 2 fault. To describe the diagnosability of faults and the relationships between faults and fault features, the Diagnosis Matrix (D-matrix) is established. Fault features may exhibit higher uncertainty under different system configurations, control sequences, fault severities, and operating conditions. To address this issue, we adopted the cross-validation approach to generate D-matrix using different datasets, taking their averages as the final D-matrix to eliminate the influence of different operating conditions on the diagnostic results. The final D-matrix is shown in Table 2 . In Table 2(a), Pearson coefficients between faults and fault features are calculated. If fault fi is associated with fault feature j, i.e., when fault fi occurs, the SPC can detect the abnormality of fault feature j, the element corresponding to the ith row and jth column in the table is close to 1. On the contrary, if fault fi is not associated with fault feature j, the element corresponding to the ith row and jth column in the table is closed to 0. If all the Pearson coefficients are replaced with 1 if they are greater than 0.8 otherwise replaced with 0, respectively, a 0\u20131 matrix is obtained as Table 2(b). Since the columns of the 0\u20131 matrix need to be different from each other, these nine faults are distinguishable and can be correctly diagnosed. The D-matrix enhances the interpretability of fault causes by structurally representing the relationships between faults and their characteristics, achieves precision in fault localization, and strengthens the capability of fault prediction, thereby optimizing maintenance strategies and improving the overall reliability and performance of the system. 4 Experimental results 4.1 Description of the experiments and experimental data The ASHRAE RP-1312 project [41], funded by ASHRAE, collected data from two real AHUs in HVAC to form the ASHRAE RP-1312 dataset. The data collected by the ASHRAE RP-1312 project includes measurements from a variety of sensors, such as temperature, humidity, pressure, and flow, which are distributed across different locations in the AHU. This data encompasses not only measurements during normal operations but also includes faults that were intentionally introduced under controlled conditions, allowing researchers to study the behavior of the system under fault conditions. The dataset contains three normal samples and one sample for each of the 13 faults. Each sample contains 540 sampling points, and each sampling point is composed of 95 features. Since it was decided to use this dataset to validate the proposed fault diagnosis method, the main nine of the thirteen types of faults in this dataset are considered. These faults are shown in Table 3 and include the cooling coil valve stuck at 15% open position, cooling coil valve stuck at 65% open position, cooling coil valve stuck at the full closed position, cooling coil valve stuck at the fully open position, return air fan completely damaged, return air stuck at a fixed speed, outdoor air dampers leaking (equivalent to 45% open), outdoor air dampers leaking (equivalent to 55% of the opening), outdoor air valve stuck in the fully closed position. After selecting the fault features, we extracted 1620 normal data points and 4860 fault data points from the ASHRAE RP-1312 dataset for experimental validation of the proposed two-stage fault diagnosis method. To verify the method, we conducted the following three experiments. In subsection 4.2, we discussed the impact of the choice of hyperparameters, e.g., the activation function and the order of the polynomial network, on model accuracy. In subsection 4.3, we compared the fault diagnosis results obtained using the SPC method proposed with those obtained without using this method, and further evaluated our diagnostic method through cross-validation. In subsection 4.4, we compared our method with several other widely used methods. 4.2 Selection of activation function and the order of the polynomial in BP-MTN The main purpose of this experiment is to select the hyperparameters of BP-MTN, including 1) selecting the optimal activation function; and 2) the optimal polynomial order. Firstly, we compare the performance of BP-MTN using different activation functions to determine the best activation function. The experiment mainly considers eight classic activation functions: ReLU, Leaky ReLU, sigmoid, Tanh, softsign, softplus, ELU and Swish. The training convergence curves of Δ Q rf \u2019s BP-MTN model using the eight activation functions are shown in Fig. 10 (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g) and (h), respectively. From the figures, when ReLU, LeakyReLU, Softplus, ELU and Swish are used as the activation functions, the model converges faster. We calculated the MAPE of the fitting results under eight activation function settings, and the results are shown in Table 4 , with Tanh having the lowest MAPE. However, after experiments, using an activation function with a low MAPE value leads to model learning the noise in data and has poor generalization ability. On the contrary, Softplus performs best in the total diagnosis process and is chosen as the final setting. (14) M A P E = 1 n ∑ i = 1 n | y i - y ^ i | | y i | × 100 In addition to the activation function, the choice of the order of the polynomial network also affects the BP-MTN fitting ability for nonlinear features. As shown in Table 4, since the Softplus activation function was chosen, we compared the use of different polynomial orders under the Softplus activation function. Here, the fault feature Qrf is taken as an example. As shown in Table 5 , we used polynomial order, model training time, and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) as indicators for comparison. From the table, when using the 4th-order polynomial, BP-MTN obtained the smallest RMSE of 9.0875. But for the same reason with choosing Softplus, we finally choose the 3rd-order polynomial. For different fault features, the selection of activation function and the polynomial order may differ. Therefore, it is necessary to set the optimal polynomial order for the BP-MTN of each feature separately. 4.3 Comparison between BP-MTN and other fitters In this subsection, the proposed BP-MTN is compared to other fitters, including 1) GRNN; 2) LSTM; and 3) RBF. To ensure fair comparison and repeatability of the work, the parameter settings for the models used in the comparison are as follows. For GRNN, the spread of radial basis functions is set to 0.1, and the maximum number of radial basis functions is set to 100. For LSTM, the number of hidden layer units is set to 10, the maximum epochs are set to 100, the gradient threshold is set to 1, and the initial learning rate is set to 0.01. For RBF, the spread of radial basis functions is set to 1.0. The comparison results for these methods are presented in Table 6 . Model training time and RMSE are considered as the performance metrics. Although the fitting accuracy of the model constructed is not the best, the training time of the model is the shortest, which can meet the requirement of diagnostic speed for online fault diagnosis. The model training time of the BP-MTN is 67.45% of the GRNN, 1.62% of the LSTM, and 0.85% of the RBF, respectively. The model accuracy of the BP-MTN is better than other methods. 4.4 Validation of the SPC method The purpose of this experiment is to verify the effectiveness of the proposed SPC method in filtering out false alarms and improving the accuracy of fault diagnosis. To verify the SPC method, we take the detection of fault f 6 based on the fault feature ΔQrf as an example. As shown in Fig. 11 , the estimates of the fault feature ΔQrf , the UCL, and the LCL are marked with blue, red, and yellow lines, respectively. When fault f 6 does not occur, the corresponding change of the fault feature Q rf is relatively stable, and estimates of Q rf are within the confidence interval [LCL, UCL]. On the contrary, when the fault occurs, Q rf will jump out [LCL, UCL]. The traditional method is to determine that a fault has occurred once Q rf exceeds [LCL, UCL]. However, the jump out of the confidence interval may be caused by model errors or measurement noise, leading to false alarms. Therefore, in the proposed SPC method, once the fault feature exceeds the confidence interval, the current jumping point i 1 is recorded. When K consecutive points jump out of the confidence interval, these points i 1, \u2026, iK are considered as fault points, and the fault is detected. After the repairmen of fault, the system records the time j 1 when it jumps back into the confidence interval. After j 1, when K consecutive points are continuously within the confidence interval, j 1, \u2026, jK are considered as normal points, and the system fault is repaired and enters a normal state. Fig. 12 (a) and (b) show the fault diagnosis result without and with SPC, respectively. In the figure, each row represents the true label, and each column represents the predicted label. After applying SPC, the error classification of the majority of faults in Fig. 12(a) was correctly identified, leading to a 0.397% improvement in fault diagnosis accuracy. 4.5 Validation of the MTN-SPC fault diagnosis method To further evaluate the stability and generalization performance of the proposed method based on the AHSRAE-1312 dataset, three-fold cross-validation was used. Since the BP-MTN fitting model and the fault diagnosis method based on SPC were trained using only normal data, the fault data were not involved in the training process. Therefore, the cross-validation method used in this study involved dividing the 1620 normal data samples into three subsets, using two subsets for training in each iteration, and using the remaining subset and the fault data for testing. The results of the cross-validation experiment are shown in Table 7 . The \u201c99.94\u201d in \u201c99.94 ± 0.11%\u201d represents the average diagnostic accuracy of the three-fold cross-validation, and \u201c0.11\u201d represents the standard deviation. It can be found that the diagnostic accuracy of all faults is almost 100% after adding our SPC rule. Therefore, the MTN-SPC performs better than BP-MTN. In addition, the diagnostic results for different faults are presented in the form of a bar chart in Fig. 13 . It can be seen from the chart that the diagnostic accuracy of most faults is above 99%. To alleviate the overfitting problem of the BP-MTN fitter, the Dropout algorithm proposed will be introduced in the BP-MTN training process in the future to further reduce the complexity of the BP-MTN and improve its generalization ability. 4.6 Diagnosis results and comparison with other methods In this subsection, the proposed MTN-SPC fault diagnosis method is compared to other typical fault classifiers, including 1) Random Forest (RF); 2) SVM; 3) K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN); and 4) Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). In these methods, although the MLP method is considered traditional, there are instances where it still performs well, being recognized as a classic and effective approach. Hence, it is also included as one of the methods for comparison. To ensure fair comparison and repeatability of the work, the parameter settings for the models used in the comparison are as follows. When using an RF as a classifier for diagnosing faults, 100 trees are employed, and the mean leaf size is set to 1. When using the K-NN method, the K value representing the number of nearest neighbors is set to 3, and the Manhattan distance is considered as the distance metric. The MLP classifier has three hidden layers with neuron quantities of 8, 9, and 10, respectively. Considering that the F1-score simultaneously considers the precision and recall of the classification model, it can better describe the diagnostic accuracy. Therefore, the F1-score is selected as the performance metric. The range of F1-score is from 0 to 1, where a score closer to 1 indicates more accurate fault diagnosis results. As shown in the table, the precision, recall, and F1-score of the MTN-SPC are 1, 1, and 1, respectively, outperforming other methods. The fault diagnosis results of these methods are presented in Table 8 , where Table 8(a), Table 8(b), and Table 8(c) show Precision, Recall, and F1-score, respectively. To further validate the performance of these methods, three-fold cross-validation is employed to assess the stability and generalization performance of the models. Specifically, the diagnostic results are the average of three diagnostic recognition rates. The experimental results are depicted in Fig. 14 . From the figure, the green bar represents the diagnostic accuracy of MTN-SPC. It can be observed that this bar is higher than the bars corresponding to other methods, indicating that MTN-SPC performs the best. In summary, the advantages of the diagnostic method proposed in this paper can be summarized as follows: \u2022 Interpretability: Unlike traditional deep learning-based methods, the proposed SPC-based method provides clear explanations for the causes of faults, which helps to understand the root cause of the faults. \u2022 Fast speed: Our MTN-SPC method is faster than many classical methods in terms of speed. \u2022 Strong robustness: Unlike traditional SPC, our proposed SPC method is more robust and accurate. We do not simply judge whether a fault has occurred based on the jump of a single data point, but consider the trend of changes in several consecutive data points. Only when the change trend of these data points significantly exceeds a certain range, will it be considered as a fault occurrence. This method can not only effectively avoid the accidental misjudgment of a single data point, but also better capture the true fault signal, thereby reducing the false alarm rate and improving the robustness of the method. 5 Conclusion This paper presents a fault diagnosis framework based on BP-MTN fitting and a novel Markov-based SPC for diagnosing equipment failures in Air Handling Units (AHUs). The BP-MTN fitter exhibits high fitting accuracy and faster speed compared to many fitting methods, achieving high fault diagnosis accuracy. The proposed SPC can detect anomalies in real time, filter out false alarms, enhance the accuracy of fault diagnosis, and improve the algorithm's robustness. Additionally, the SPC's clear analysis of anomalies through real-time system monitoring endows the decision-making process with a high degree of interpretability. The D-matrix also explicitly reflects the relationship between faults and their characteristics. Therefore, the method proposed in this paper is characterized by its rapidity, robustness, real-time capability, and interpretability, offering a new perspective on fault diagnosis in AHUs. The BP-MTN proposed in this paper may require the use of high-order polynomials to achieve precision when dealing with highly complex nonlinear systems. However, this approach can lead to an overly complex model, a high computational burden, and a delayed completion of fault diagnosis. To address this issue, future work will incorporate ideas such as ResNet and Dropout into BP-MTN to reduce model complexity while enhancing its generalization capability. Additionally, this method does not necessitate the establishment of a physical model for the equipment, making it easily applicable to other complex systems, such as engines.

        "dc:description": "Faults in Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning Air Handling Units can lead to increased energy consumption and failure to meet human comfort standards. Accurate and prompt fault diagnosis of Air Handling Units is therefore critical. Although widely-used deep learning methods have shown high precision in fault diagnosis, they present two main drawbacks: 1) deep learning approaches are often \u201cblack box\u201d models lacking interpretability and rely on labeled data; 2) their complex structures entail substantial computational resources, which may not be conducive to timely fault diagnosis. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces a method for diagnosing faults in air handling units that combines a novel statistical process control strategy, a backpropagation multidimensional Taylor network fitter, and a D-matrix approach. The backpropagation multidimensional Taylor network, using a polynomial network with only one hidden layer, approximates nonlinear functions. Compared to deep learning models, it maintains high accuracy with a simpler structure, enabling rapid fault diagnosis. Additionally, the novel statistical process control strategy employs the Markov property for fault detection, characterized by low false alarm rates, interpretability, robustness, minimal labeled data requirements, and suitability for real-time monitoring. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our method in diagnosing faults in air handling units, achieving an average precision of 99.9%, surpassing several commonly used techniques.",
