A climate-adaptive temperature and humidity independent control system (CATHICS) is proposed, of which heat and humidity ratio (ε) is adjustable to afford the changing indoor heat and humidity load. Zeotropic mixture R32/R236fa is employed due to its characteristic of temperature glide during phase change. A module for composition regulation is incorporated based on boiling point difference of zeotropic mixture. High/low boiling point component increasing modes are operated when indoor air state deviates from the accuracy standard. Temperature glide regions of non-isothermal cooling sources change with the concentration of zeotropic mixture, which conforms to cascade utilization for moisture and heat load removal. The cooling and dehumidifying capacity of the chiller is regulated correspondingly. The models of evaporation temperature glide, affordable ε, cooling and dehumidification efficiency are established. The effects on the affordable ε are analyzed with the changing outdoor meteorological parameters and indoor personnel fluctuation. The relationship between mass concentration of working fluid and sliding temperature regions is revealed. The affordable ε varies from 3500 to 4700 kJ/kg, which illustrates that the CATHICS can totally afford changing heat and humidity load. The cooling and dehumidification efficiency are approximately 3.2 and 1.2. The vapor quality of the working fluid from the condenser is analyzed. The highly-integrated CATHICS is suitable for realizing individualized thermal comfort in residential buildings.

Air-conditioning systems consume approximately 50% of total energy demand, of which energy consumption rises steadily accounting for the growing population and thermal comfort demand (Khan, Hou, Zakari & Tawiah, 2021; Yang, Yan & Lam, 2014). Human spend over 70% of lifetime indoor. Indoor air quality is closely related with fitness and productivity (Yuan, Chen, Zhong & Wang, 2019; Zhong, Lee & Haghighat, 2017). Therefore, achieving thermal comfort need is gradually raising concerns, especially indoor moisture disposal (Soares et al., 2017). Conventional air conditioning systems maintain indoor air at the predetermined state which feature variable air volume (VAV) and variable refrigerant flow (VRF) (Yu, Yan, Sun, Hong & Zhu, 2016). The increasing evaporating temperature of 1 °C results in 2.8% increase in coefficient of performance (COP) and 2.5% decrease in energy consumption, however, weakens the dehumidification performance due to temperature and humidity coupled handling (Ahamed, Saidur & Masjuki, 2011; Arshad, Qummare, Syed, Feroz, & Mohd, 2021; Chan & Yeung, 2005). Decoupling humidity treatment from cooling process is conducive for decreasing energy efficiency defection of air-conditioning systems. Currently, independent humidity control strategies involve active method such as liquid (She et al., 2018; She, Yin & Zhang, 2015, 2016) or solid (Sultan, El-Sharkawy, Miyazaki, Saha & Koyama, 2015) desiccant-based system generated by low grade energy. However, additional energy loss caused by post-cooling process and complex configuration due to mutually exclusive configuration still burden these systems (Jia, Dai, Wu & Wang, 2006). Highly-integrated temperature and humidity independent control (THIC) systems with efficient cooling sources are more feasible in high-density residential buildings. A double evaporating temperature (DET) chiller is proposed based on zeotropic mixture R32/R236fa, of which non-isothermal cooling sources are generated for respective heat and moisture removal (J. Liu et al., 2017; J. Liu, She, Zhang, Man & Zhou, 2016). Zeotropic mixture R32/R236fa consists of an certain proportion of R32 and R236fa with different boiling points, of which characteristic is its obvious temperature glide during phase change. Indoor heating and humidity load alter with the personnel flow and outdoor meteorological parameters (X. Liu, Li, Jiang & Lin, 2006). As for the DET chiller, the commonly used inverter compressor in charge of refrigeration capacity regulation fails to meet the changing heat and humidity load simultaneously. Cooling demands for buildings of heterogeneous nature change seasonally, which require periodical building commissioning during lifetime of the buildings (Fouda & Melikyan, 2010). Air-conditioning systems, the most energy-consuming sector, of which commissioning is critical for building sustainability (Xiao & Wang, 2009). As a shift towards energy-efficient buildings, meeting the thermal needs in different climatic conditions can effectively reduce energy consumption, which conforms to the sustainable objectives of air-conditioning systems (Rickenbacker et al., 2020). Energy management systems (EMS) in grid-connected photovoltaic-equipped microgrids are designed for peak load shifting according to occupancy behavior in the building of heterogeneous nature. Research indicates that EMS can intelligently change the energy demand of each building due to occupancy schedules and weather conditions. Optimization approach for EMS is aimed to improve the aggregate performance based on energy cost and thermal comfort of the occupants (Korkas, Baldi & Kosmatopoulos, 2018, 2015). A self-tuning building with intelligent demand management is proposed, of which operating modes can be switched via smart zoning strategy triggered by occupancy patterns. Tests show that the self-tuning approach is more adaptive for variable weather and occupancy states, which can achieve 15% energy saving and 25% thermal comfort improvement (Baldi, Korkas, Lv & Kosmatopoulos, 2018). EMS is mainly applied in grid-connected or district-level microgrids, of which capital cost is too much for household air-conditioning systems. To overcome the difficulties above, a climate-adaptive temperature and humidity independent control system (CATHICS) is proposed, of which aim is to deal with the varying sensible and latent loads in different climates. The objectives of this study are as follows: i) to investigate the existing climate-adaptive systems including applications, limitations, effects and so on; ii) to exploit the working mechanism of the CATHICS and its operation modes under varying indoor and outdoor climatic conditions; iii) to research the performance of the CATHICS. The application potential of the proposed CATHICS is analyzed in representative cities from hot and wet regions in South China. 2 Existing and proposed climate-adaptive systems 2.1 Existing climate-adaptive systems To exploit and retrofit the CATHICS, an overview of several existing climate-adaptive strategies is presented, which mainly focuses on the application scenarios, advantages and limitations (Table 1 ). Influencing factors on operation strategies under seasonal conditions are highlighted. An adaptive full-range decoupled ventilation (ADV) strategy is proposed for buildings requiring strict temperature and humidity control. Different ventilation strategies with an additional economizer promise all-year-round operation (Zhuang & Wang, 2020; Zhuang, Wang & Shan, 2019). Different ventilation strategies are implemented to cope with weather and internal load conditions taking economical performance into account. The appropriate ADV strategy is implemented with comprehensive consideration of indoor and outdoor conditions, internal sensible and latent load and the minimum electrical load. The bulk make-up air handling units for sufficient dehumidification limits its application in high-density residential buildings. The retrofit of the original ventilation strategy into ADV strategy needs overall consideration of cost and payback periods. Passive ventilation integrated with smart windows has been combined with heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) system, which has improved energy performance and thermal comfort of occupants (Javad & Navid, 2019). Each operation mode depends on occupants\u2019 preference, indoor and outdoor conditions (Park & Chang, 2020). Except for the air supply rate, window-to-wall ratio (WWR) and opening location of windows are also considered in terms of indoor air quality (Goia, 2016). However, research demonstrates that smart window-integrated ventilation (SWV) system only outperforms HVAC system in winter. In other seasons especially in summer, the air quality processed by SWV system is poorer than HVAC system. A multi-unit heat pump is proposed for all-year round temperature and humidity control for the residential buildings (Fan, Shao & Tian, 2014). Condensation heat of two-parallel connected condensers is recovered partially or totally, which realizes annual operating modes. Factors including volume, temperature and relative humidity of indoor/outdoor air affect the energy performance of the heat pump. The remaining issues such as coupling treatment of heat and moisture and seasonal facility idling need further improvement. 2.2 Proposed climate-adaptive system (CATHICS) To exploit a climate-adaptive system, conjunction with an additional module for mode switching in different climates is essential based on the existing climate-adaptive systems. In addition, the integration of device promotes the adaptability to the installation site and application potential in high-density residential buildings. Temperature and humidity decoupling treatment is beneficial taking the indoor air quality into account. Zeotropic mixture is characterized by its temperature glide during phase change (J. Liu et al., 2016). Cooling capacity of low-temperature glide region deals with moisture load, while the high-temperature one is in charge of the heat load. In order to reflect the relationship between the temperature glide and corresponding load, the heat and humidity ratio (ε) that the chiller based on zeotropic mixture can handle is introduced. The discrepancy in boiling point of the zeotropic component provides feasibility for meeting load requirements by controlling the composition of mixture (Kim, Kim & Kim, 2004). Changes of the temperature glide regions by adjusting composition concentration can handle the ε under different indoor and outdoor conditions. Therefore, a chiller in conjunction with composition separation module based on zeotropic mixture is proposed, which enhances robustness in maintaining indoor state under different climatic conditions in residential buildings. The steps of selecting the operation modes of the chiller are shown in Fig. 1 . 3 Principle of proposed CATHICS As shown in Fig. 2 (a), CATHICS consists of a ε-adjustable chiller, air handling unit and indoor radiant terminal devices. Zeotropic mixture R32/R236fa is selected as working fluid. Zeotropic mixture R32/R236fa is composed of certain proportion of R32 and R236fa with different boiling points. Obvious temperature glide of zeotropic mixture occurs during phase change. Refrigerating capacity per unit volume of R32 is high, of which shortcomings including flammability and high exhaust temperature are covered after mixing with R236fa (J. Liu et al., 2017). R32/R236fa can provide 7/12 °C and 18/23 °C chilled water respectively in THIC air-conditioning systems. Outdoor air mixing with partial return air is dehumidified by evaporator 1 and then transported indoor in charge of moisture disposal. Waste heat is removed by circulating water cooled by evaporator 2. Subsystems including the chiller and air handling unit are introduced as follows. 3.1 Chiller The ε-adjustable chiller is composed of refrigeration component and composition regulation module. Refrigerant flows through the compressor, condenser 1, condenser 2, throttle valve, evaporator 1 and evaporator 2 under design conditions, while the composition regulation module consisting of separator 1 and separator 2 maintains unoperated in conventional mode. Once indoor air state deviates from the comfort zone due to outdoor and indoor conditions, the initial concentration corresponding to the preset ε fails to handle waste heat and dampness. In order to match the changing ε, the composition regulation module of the chiller starts operation. Adjustment of concentration for single component is realized, of which temperature-entropy and temperature-concentration diagrams are shown in Fig. 2(b) and (c). The exhaust gas (point 2) discharged from the compressor flows through the condenser 1. The partially-condensed refrigerant mixture (point 3) enters into the separator 1 after turning round the valve 1. The gas phase rich in low boiling component R32 (point 7) overflows from the top of separator 1 and then enters condenser 2 (point 9). Liquid refrigerant flows into separator 2 owing to the regulation of valve 2 and collects at the bottom when the valve 4 is closed. The exhaust valve 5 is open once the pressure of separator 2 is too high, which transports the vapor refrigerant to the compressor. The liquid mixture rich in R236fa (point 8) flows into the throttle valve (point 5\u2032), which realizes the high boiling point component increasing mode. The temperature glide during evaporation (point 5\u2032−6\u2032−1) alters with the mass concentration of R32 (M R32). Cooling capacity generated from the low-temperature evaporation region (point 5\u2032−6\u2032) is responsible for moisture load disposal, while the waste heat is handled by the high-temperature one (point 6\u2032−1). As for the low boiling point component increasing mode, the steering of the valve 1 and valve 2 remain unchanged. The liquid phase (point 8) accumulates at the bottom of separator 1 after shutting off valve 3. The condensed liquid with large content of low boiling point component (point 9) in separator 2 enters into the throttle valve (point 5\u2032\u2019). The two-phase mixture of low pressure firstly evaporates in evaporator 1 (point 6\u2032\u2019) and then absorbs heat in evaporator 2. Once indoor thermal parameters meet the accuracy standards, the valve 1 and valve 2 can be adjusted to another flow direction in conventional mode. The composition regulation module stops operating. 3.2 Air handling unit As shown in Fig. 3 , unprocessed outdoor air (W) and partial return air (N) blend (M) and then flow through the evaporator 1 (L). Fresh air after condensation dehumidification is supplied into room, which deals with moisture. The waste heat is handled by the air (C) cooled by water circulating in the radiant terminal. Personnel mobility and outdoor meteorological parameters influence temperature and relative humidity of the air-conditioning room (N\u2019, N\u2019\u2019), which accordingly affect indoor ε. Strategies for air handling process on controlling ε around the original value are operated, which aim to maintain indoor state N within the allowable range. It is common that indoor waste heat changes with heat gain of building envelope while indoor moisture generation remains constant. Under this circumstance, modification of the air around radiant terminal (C) is effective for adjusting ε that air can afford, which thus maintains indoor air (N) within acceptable range. In Fig. 4 (a), the affordable ε is related with C, which is determined by the cooling capacity of high-temperature cooling source. However, once indoor heat and moisture fluctuate sharply, fixed dew point mode (L) cannot maintain N within the accuracy requirement. Therefore, the supply air state L should be regulated shown in Fig. 4(b), which is related with refrigeration capacity of evaporator 1. Based on aforementioned adjustment strategies, the ε-adjustable chiller maintains the indoor climate N within the accuracy standard by means of regulating the corresponding cooling capacity of evaporators. On the other hand, evaporation temperature glides of zeotropic mixture vary due to the concentration change, which accordingly influence respective refrigeration capacity of evaporators. Therefore, the correlation between mass concentration, cooling capacity and affordable ε should be researched, which provides basis for the selection of operation modes for the chiller. 4 Model setup for performance evaluation 4.1 Mathematical modeling The performance of the proposed CATHICS provides directions for the concentration control of the zeotropic mixture. The numerical model of the system is established based on a chiller designed as follows: (1) A rolling rotor compressor with constant speed is selected, of which theoretical displacement is 3.1m3/h; (2) Air-cooled heat exchangers are chosen as condensers. Condenser 1 is divided into superheated vapor and two-phase region, while the condenser 2 is composed of two-phase and supercooled liquid region. The structural data of the condensers are listed in Table 2 . (3) An air-cooled heat exchanger is selected as evaporator 1, of which structure data is shown in Table 2. Evaporator 2 is designed as shell-and-tube type heat exchanger with one shell pass and four tube passes. The outer and inner diameters of copper tubes are 15 mm and 13 mm, which are arranged in an equilateral triangle. The inner diameter of the shell is designed as 308 mm. The numerical models of each component of the chiller are established based on the following assumptions are made as follows for the simplified description of the system (Arshad, Syed & Mohd, 2021; J. Liu & Lin, 2020): (1) Refrigerant and air are deemed one-dimensional flow. (2) Pressure drop and thermal resistance of tubes are ignorable. (3) Fouling resistance is ignored since R32/R236fa and polyester oil are mutually soluble. (4) Refrigerant flows through the throttle valve depressurized in isenthalpic state. (5) Subcooling and superheated degree are bound within 2 °C due to several temperature glide during phase change of zeotropic mixture. For the compressor, mass flow rate of refrigerant and power of the compressor are calculated by Duprez, Dumont and Frère, (2007) (1) m c o m = λ V t h v s u c (2) W c o m = m c o m ( h 2 − h 1 ) where λ is coefficient of mass flow; V th is theoretical volume capacity; v suc is specific volume at suction point 1; h is specific enthalpy. Lumped parameter model is utilized for calculating heat transfer coefficient and heat transfer rate of condensers (Browne & Bansal, 1998). The energy equations, heat transfer coefficient and logarithmic mean temperature difference are written by: (3) Q c o n d 1 = m c o m ( h 2 − h 3 ) (4) Q c o n d 2 = m c o m ( h 3 − h 4 ) (5) K = ( A o f K r A i + 1 K a ) − 1 (6) Δ t m = ( t r , i − t a , o ) − ( t r , o − t a , i ) l n t r , i − t a , o t r , o − t a , i where A of, A i are area of fin surface and inner tube; subscripts r, a, i, o are refrigerant, air, inlet and outlet. The mass flow rate through the expansion valve can be expressed by (7) m t v = C t v A t v 2 ( P k − P e ) / v 4 where C is flow coefficient; P k is condensation pressure; P e is evaporation pressure. Evaporator modeling resembles that of condensers. The temperature glide during evaporation and dehumidification rate can be calculated by (8) t g l i d e 1 = t 6 − t b (9) t g l i d e 2 = t d − t 6 (10) M w = G a ( d a , i − d a , o ) where t b is bubble point temperature at P e; t d is dew point temperature at P e; G is mass rate; d is moisture content. The numerical procedure of the system model is shown in Fig. 5 . The models are solved by MATLAB combined with statement \u201crefpropm\u201d, which calculate the specified points of thermodynamic state of zeotropic mixture based on REFPROP software. In order to intuitively analyze the adaptive operation of the chiller to indoor climate, model of ε based on the cooling capacity of cooling sources is established. The indoor ε is described as follows (11) ε = ∑ Q W Indoor waste moisture is defined by (12) W = G L ( d N − d L ) in which, G L is total supply air rate. Low-temperature cooling source undertakes indoor latent heat and partial sensible heat as well as cooling load of fresh air, of which cooling capacity can be defined as (13) Q e v a 1 = G L ( h N − h L ) + G W ( h W − h N ) in which, G W is fresh air rate; High-temperature cooling source deals with remaining waste heat, which is defined by (14) Q e v a 2 = G F ( h N − h C ) Indoor waste heat can be expressed by (15) ∑ Q = G L ( h N − h L ) + G F ( h N − h C ) Indoor ε can be written as (16) ε = G L ( h N − h L ) + G F ( h N − h C ) G L ( d N − d L ) In order to establish the relationship between the cooling capacity of cooling source and affordable ε, total waste heat can be defined by cooling capacity of evaporators (17) ∑ Q = Q e v a 1 + Q e v a 2 − G W ( h W − h N ) The fresh air ratio can be defined as (18) G W G L = h M − h N h W − h N Taking Eq. (16\u201317) into Eq. (10), the ε can also be written as (19) ε = Q e v a 1 + Q e v a 2 − G L h M + G L h N G L ( d N − d L ) The cooling efficiency and dehumidification efficiency of the proposed CATHICS can be calculated by (20) E E R c = Q e v a 1 + Q e v a 2 W c o m (21) E E R d = M w W c o m 4.2 Model validation In order to verify the accuracy of the model, the simulation results of cooling capacity of evaporators and condensers are compared with the experimental results in variable conditions including mass concentration of zeotropic mixture and outlet temperatures of chilled water. In the experiment, the condenser is a double-pipe heat exchanger of 6 kW rated heat transfer capacity, while the rated heat transfer capacity of two evaporators is 3 kW respectively (J. Liu et al., 2016, 2017). The return temperature of chilled water is controlled by the electrical heater and circulated at the volumetric flow rate of 0.288 m3/h. The parameters of the evaporators are listed in Table 3 . Mass concentration of zeotropic mixture is selected as 30%: 70%, 40%: 60%, 50%: 50% and 60%: 40%. The temperature of chilled water out of the evaporator 2 varies from 16 to 18 °C. As shown in Fig. 6 , comparison of evaporators and condensers shows that the average error of the refrigeration capacity is less than 5%, which verifies the rationality of the model. 5 Performance analysis of the CATHICS The former researches on the climate-adaptive systems indicate that indoor and outdoor conditions are the main factors on the operation modes. To formulate the operation scheme of the ε-adjustable chiller, this chapter researches on the influencing factors on ε including indoor and outdoor air parameters. The responsive strategy is operated based on mass concentration regulation of zeotropic refrigerant. Therefore, the influence of mass concentration of zeotropic refrigerant on the temperature glide and cooling capacity is studied, which provides basis for concentration adjustment. The effect on mass concentration of refrigerant is also researched and provides guides for composition control. In addition, the cooling and dehumidification efficiency of the system are analyzed with varying mass concentration and air parameters. 5.1 Influencing factors on ε Indoor thermal climate is bound with human comfort which depends on indoor working conditions and outdoor atmospheric condition. It is common that indoor moisture content keeps constant while heat load increases accounting for outdoor climate or indoor activities. Sometimes drastic personnel fluctuation gives rise to indoor moisture generation. In order to figure out the influencing factors on the affordable ε of the chiller, the temperature and relative humidity of return air (N) and outdoor air (W) are adjusted. Temperature of return air (t N) varies from 26 to 29 °C and relative humidity (φ N) varies from 50 to 80%. Temperature of outdoor air (t W) varies from 31 to 34 °C and relative humidity (φ W) varies from 70 to 90%. In addition, the volume of indoor and outdoor air is changed by adjusting the supply air velocity and fresh air ratio. The air velocity changes from 1.5 to 2.5 m/s, while the fresh air ratio varies from 20 to 35%. Mass concentration 40%: 60%, 45%: 55% and 50%: 50% of R32/R236fa is selected as working fluid. As shown in Fig. 7 (a), the effect of t N and t W on the affordable ε is different. The decreasing t W brings about a higher affordable ε. The heat gain is reduced along with the decreasing outdoor temperature, which accordingly reduces indoor sensible heat load. The original operation of the chiller leads to the increasing affordable ε. The same conclusion can be drawn according to the Eq. (17). The specific enthalpy of outdoor air is reduced with decreasing t W. As component of mixing air into the evaporator 1, the increasing t N increases the specific enthalpy of return air as well as mixing air. Therefore, the affordable ε of the chiller in conventional mode increases. Fig. 7(b) shows that the affordable ε decreases with the increasing φ N and φ W, between which outdoor air exerts significant effect on the ε. It can be explained that when φ N increases, indoor moisture content grows in quantity. The affordable ε decreases as a result revealed from Eq. (19). Specific enthalpy of outdoor air increases with the increasing φ W, which brings about a lower ε that the chiller can afford in original operation. In Fig. 7(c), the affordable ε decreases with the increasing fresh air ratio (G W/G L) and supply air velocity (V L). As can be seen, the affordable ε declines from 5000 to 1200 kJ/kg as V L increases from 1.5 to 2.5 m/s. The increasing supply air takes more evaporation heat away from the evaporator 1, which improves the cooling capacity and dehumidification performance. Moreover, the more supply air brings in redundant moisture, which leads to a reduced ε disclosed by Eq. (16) as well. The affordable ε declines from 7500 to 3700 kJ/kg when G W/G L increases from 20 to 25%. The increasing volume of outdoor air results in the state of heating and humidification for the mixed air. The increasing specific enthalpy of mixing air processed by the evaporator 1 in original operation can afford a lower ε, which can also be drawn from Eq. (16). 5.2 Effect of mass concentration Zeotropic mixture is characterized by its temperature glide during phase change, on which the chiller depends to generate non-isothermal cooling sources. Cooling capacity from sliding temperature regions manages to handle moisture and heat load respectively. Under the premise of constant indoor and outdoor state, the effect of mass concentration on the temperature glide and cooling capacity of evaporators is shown in Fig. 7. The trend of glide temperature and cooling capacity of zeotropic mixture with the mass concentration of refrigerant is almost identical in each evaporator. In detail, temperature glide of zeotropic mixture during low-temperature evaporation decreases with the increasing M R32. The component R32 with low boiling point preferentially evaporates in the evaporator 1. Increasing M R32 accordingly leads to more severe evaporation, which increases the evaporating pressure and temperature. The bubble point of the zeotropic mixture increases with the increasing evaporating pressure. Therefore, the temperature difference between the bubble point and outlet temperature of evaporator 1 slips less with the increasing R32 proportion in zeotropic mixture. In addition, Fig. 8 shows that the high-temperature glide region increases slightly and then decreases sharply with the increasing M R32. This partly accounts from the same changing tendency of the temperature difference between bubble point and dew point of zeotropic mixture. The effect of M R32 on the refrigeration capacity and manageable ε is shown in Fig. 9 . The refrigeration capacity of low-temperature cooling source decreases with the increasing M R32. This is mainly caused by the reduced temperature glide during low-temperature phase change. In addition, the evaporation pressure and evaporation temperature increase with the increasing M R32. It can be noted that the cooling capacity of evaporator 2 sharply decreases when M R32 is over 45%. The density of R32 is smaller and its increasing proportion causes the decrease in mass flow rate of the refrigerant, which accordingly leads to the decrease in refrigeration capacity. Moreover, the temperature glide in the evaporator 2 exerts dominant effect on refrigeration capacity of the evaporator 2. As can be seen from Fig. 9, ε increases and then decreases rapidly with the increasing M R32. The ε that the chiller can afford varies from 3500 to 4700 kJ/kg, which demonstrates that the chiller possesses effective capacity for heat and humidity load control. Affordable ε reaches the maximum value when M R32 is at 40%. This results from the cooling capacity of cooling sources, between which the high-temperature one plays a critical role. When M R32 is less than 40%, the increasing refrigeration capacity of evaporator 2 enhances the ability for heat load removal. The decreasing cooling capacity of high-temperature cooling source weakens the ability to handle waste heat, which causes the decrease in the affordable ε. When M R32 exceeds 45%, the cooling capacity of evaporator 1 and corresponding ε decrease obviously. Therefore, for example, zeotropic mixture with initial M R32 of 50% is charged into the chiller. If t W and φ W increase, M R32 should be decreased in order to maintain a stable ε. Correspondingly, the cooling capacity of evaporator 1 and evaporator 2 increase. By contrary, the dehumidification and warming of indoor air (N) demand the storage of R236fa. 5.3 Influencing factors on mass concentration As mentioned above, mass concentration of zeotropic refrigerant exerts significant effect on the thermodynamic performance of the chiller. In order to regulate M R32 for treatment of the changing heat and moisture load, the vapor quality of the working fluid at the outlet of condenser 1 is researched as well as the vapor-liquid composition. As can be seen from Fig. 10 , the increase in M R32 increases both vapor quality and R32 composition in vapor-liquid phase. The composition R32 condenses more slowly than R236fa, which leads to more vapor at the outlet of condenser 1. Adjusting the vapor quality at the outlet of condenser 1 is feasible for monitoring and controlling the component concentration in vapor/liquid phase. Fig. 11 demonstrates the effect of flow rate and inlet temperature of air to the condenser 1 on vapor quality and M R32. As can be seen, the concentration of vapor-liquid phase is slightly influenced by the temperature and flow rate of supply air for the condenser 1. In addition, the decreasing flow rate and increasing temperature of air result in the increase in vapor quality. The higher air rate increases the contacting time between air and heat exchange surface, which absorbs more heat from the refrigerant. More zeotropic mixture condenses, of which vapor quality decreases as a result. The increasing inlet temperature of air decreases the temperature difference between air and refrigerant, which leads to less condensation of zeotropic mixture. The mass flow rate of detached vapor phase and liquid phase will be influenced by the vapor quality. Therefore, the regulation of vapor quality provides basis for the mass concentration modification of working fluid. Moreover, the increasing vapor quality leads to more R32 in vapor phase, which is then condensed by condenser 2. The concentration of R32 in separator 2 increases as a result. 5.4 Cooling and dehumidification efficiency In order to figure out the performance of the proposed system, cooling efficiency and dehumidification efficiency are analyzed with the changing M R32 and supply air. As can be seen from Fig. 12 , the EER c of the CATHICS varies from 3.0 to 3.2 and the EER d varies from 1.0 to 1.6. Both EER c and EER d decrease with the increasing M R32, which mainly account from the decrease in the mass flow rate of refrigerant. P e and P k both increase due to more evaporation of R32. Due to the small slope of isentropic line of R32, the power consumption of the compressor increases with the increasing M R32. The increasing M R32 also leads to the increasing latent heat and cooling capacity of the refrigerant, which fails to make up for the increase in power consumption of the compressor. The EER c of the system decreases as a result with the increasing M R32. The above analysis of cooling capacity of evaporator 1 demonstrates that the dehumidification capacity weakens with increasing M R32. The EER d decreases due to the increase in power consumption of the compressor. The relative humidity of supply air exerts a dominant effect on the EER d. The higher φ W leads to a higher EER d, which accounts from the greater water content difference between the inlet and outlet of supply air. 5.5 Operation analysis for the ε-adjustable chiller Based on the above analysis, the ε-adjustable chiller can adapt to the changing indoor thermal climate by means of regulating mass concentration of zeotropic mixture. The fluctuation of indoor air induced by outdoor and indoor atmosphere can be suppressed by switching operation modes of the chiller. The regulation schemes in coordination with the thermal environment representative by hot and wet regions in South China are introduced as follows: (1) If initial M R32 is less than 40%, the chiller should operate in the low boiling point component (R32) increasing mode when φ N, φ W, t W, V L and G W/G L increase. R32 increasing mode is also applicable for the condition that t N deceases. Reducing flow rate and increasing supply temperature of air into the condenser 1 will increase vapor quality of refrigerant, which thus realize R32 concentration increasing mode. In hot and humid summer in South China, the temperature and relative humidity of outdoor air are usually high. The heat and moisture load grow. Cooling capacity of the chiller increases due to the increasing R32 component, which is also applicable for the condition of indoor personnel increase. In autumn and spring, temperature and relative humidity of outdoor air decrease. The chiller should operate in R32 reducing mode, which also suits for the circumstance of significant staff decrease. (2) If M R32 is more than 40%, high boiling point component (R236fa) increasing mode is operated when outdoor air becomes warmer and wetter in summer. Correspondingly, the cooling and dehumidification capacity of the chiller are improved, which also afford the condition that the φ N, V L and G W/G L increase and t N decreases. R236fa increasing mode can be achieved by increasing the flow rate and decreasing the temperature of supply air into condenser 1. In spring and autumn, the chiller is switched to R32 increasing mode and operates in conventional mode once indoor environment accords with individualized comfort. In practical application, the separation range of zeotropic mixture is limited (Kim et al., 2004). In addition, the composition shift occurs commonly during phase change, which accordingly changes the composition of zeotropic mixture entering the separator. Therefore, the controllability of the separation is vital to the composition adjustment of the zeotropic mixture. Conducting the dynamic simulation and enhancing the separation efficiency of the composition regulation module are essential for the optimization design and control of the CATHICS. 6 Conclusions A novel CATHICS with adjustable ε is proposed to satisfy climatic thermal requirements. The concept and principle of the proposed CATHICS are introduced and compared with the existing climate-adaptive systems. A module for composition regulation is incorporated based on boiling temperature difference of zeotropic refrigerant. High/low boiling point component increasing modes are implemented and switched according to indoor and outdoor conditions. In order to figure out the performance of the CATHICS, the mathematical models of performance index are established including ε, EER c and EER d. Main conclusions are made as follows based on the results of performance investigation: (1) The affordable ε of the chiller depends on indoor and outdoor conditions including temperature, relative humidity and volume of indoor and outdoor air. Heating and humidification of outdoor air and cooling of indoor air lead to the decrease in the affordable ε of the chiller. The same result can be drawn by increasing the supply air volume and fresh air ratio. (2) M R32 is related with the counter-utilized evaporation temperature glide, which influences the corresponding dehumidification and cooling capacity. The ε that the chiller can deal with increases and then decreases with increasing M R32. The affordable ε varies from 3500 to 4700 kJ/kg, which illustrates that the CATHICS is capable of heat and humidity load removal. (3) The vapor quality of zeotropic mixture from the condenser 1 provides basis for controlling the mass concentration of separated refrigerant. The decreasing flow rate and increasing temperature of air into the condenser 1 result in the increasing vapor quality, which increase R32 concentration in the separator 2 as a result. (4) The EER c and EER d of the CATHICS vary from 3.0 to 3.2 and 1.0 to 1.6, which promise favorable performance of the system. EER c and EER d both decrease with the increasing M R32. (5) In summer in South China, the chiller operates in low boiling point component (R32) increasing mode, which also manages indoor personnel increase when initial M R32 is less than 40%. The chiller switches to R236fa increasing mode in autumn and spring. If M R32 is more than 40%, the seasonal operation modes are contrary to the above strategy. The CATHICS is suitable for realizing individualized thermal comfort in residential buildings in South China due to its climate-adaptive and highly-integrated characteristic.

        "dc:description": "A climate-adaptive temperature and humidity independent control system (CATHICS) is proposed, of which heat and humidity ratio (ε) is adjustable to afford the changing indoor heat and humidity load. Zeotropic mixture R32/R236fa is employed due to its characteristic of temperature glide during phase change. A module for composition regulation is incorporated based on boiling point difference of zeotropic mixture. High/low boiling point component increasing modes are operated when indoor air state deviates from the accuracy standard. Temperature glide regions of non-isothermal cooling sources change with the concentration of zeotropic mixture, which conforms to cascade utilization for moisture and heat load removal. The cooling and dehumidifying capacity of the chiller is regulated correspondingly. The models of evaporation temperature glide, affordable ε, cooling and dehumidification efficiency are established. The effects on the affordable ε are analyzed with the changing outdoor meteorological parameters and indoor personnel fluctuation. The relationship between mass concentration of working fluid and sliding temperature regions is revealed. The affordable ε varies from 3500 to 4700 kJ/kg, which illustrates that the CATHICS can totally afford changing heat and humidity load. The cooling and dehumidification efficiency are approximately 3.2 and 1.2. The vapor quality of the working fluid from the condenser is analyzed. The highly-integrated CATHICS is suitable for realizing individualized thermal comfort in residential buildings.",
