State Key Laboratory of Fluid Power and Mechatronic Systems Zhejiang University Hangzhou 310027 China Online optimization of building thermal environment is no trivial task due to the complex and uncertain indoor thermodynamics. In this study, an extended Kalman filter-based extremum seeking control (EKF-ESC) strategy for model-free control of thermal environment under uncertainty is proposed. The EKF-ESC uses extended Kalman filter for estimating gradient of the objective function of the extremum seeking controller, which enables real-time optimization of thermal environment with fast convergence time. In addition, a co-simulation platform is developed by combining EnergyPlus and Simulink/Matlab for validating effectiveness of the EKF-ESC strategy for controlling thermal environment. Our study demonstrates that the EKF-ESC strategy has good adaptivity to uncertainties resulting from changes in weather, electrical equipment and occupancy. Moreover, it is shown that the EKF-ESC is robust to measurement noise. In addition, comparison of convergence performance among EKF-ESC, adaptive ESC, and classical ESC is conducted. It is shown that the EKF-ESC based control strategy has the fastest convergence time towards indoor temperature setpoints. Compared with the classical ESC and adaptive ESC schemes, about 77% and 55% reduction of the convergence time are realized through EKF-ESC. According to the research results, it could be inferred that EKF-ESC strategy has the potential for effective building thermal management under uncertainty with fast convergence time.

In particular, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems (HVAC) are the key component for building thermal management [2,3]. At present, the HVAC control strategies can roughly be categorized as rule-based, model-based, and model-free control strategies [4]. Rule-based controllers are widely used in practice due to their low demand for computational capacity [5,6]. However, it is difficult for the rule-based control strategies to determine the optimal control rules for real-time optimization of indoor thermal environment. On the other hand, model-based strategies are able to realize optimal control via advanced schemes, such as model predictive control (MPC) [7,8] and linear quadratic regulator (LQR) [9]. However, it is difficult to construct a precise model for describing building thermodynamics due to measurement limitations [10] and the time-varying building operation conditions. Moreover, accuracy of the building models might decrease due to the unpredicted system uncertainties [11,12], such as weather changes, indoor activities, and building renovation, which pose challenges for the model-based control strategies in real applications. Different from rule-based control and model-based control, model-free control strategies are capable of realizing optimal control in an adaptive and model-free manner without dependence on prior knowledge related to the thermal environment [13\u201315]. In particular, extremum seeking control (ESC) is a significant model-free strategy that performs real-time optimization by injecting a sinusoidal perturbation to the input signal to estimate the gradient of the objective function [16]. In the past decade, the ESC algorithm has been applied for a wide range of complex systems to deal with real-time optimization problems such as wind power optimization [17], power optimization in microbial fuel cell [18] and thermal efficiency optimization in spark-ignition engines [19], etc. Recently, there have been some pioneering works focusing on utilizing ESC for optimal control of HVAC components, such as heat pump [20,21], chilled water plant [22], and refrigerant flow system [23]. For example, Wang et al. optimized the performance of a two-stage air source heat pump water heater by using ESC to control the total power consumption [24]. Mu et al. investigated the effectiveness of multivariable ESC to simultaneously control tower airflow and condenser water flow of parallel chillers [22]. Wang et al. used the ESC scheme to maximize the coefficient of performance (COP) of a cascade air source heat pump under fixed and realistic ambient temperature profiles [25]. Gong et al. applied the ESC scheme for minimizing power consumption of a vapor injection high-temperature heat pump system [26]. Koeln et al. implemented ESC-based control strategy to achieve optimal subcooling of a vapor compression system [27]. These previous studies demonstrate that the classical ESC scheme can optimize the performance of HVAC components efficiently in a model-free manner. However, despite the model-free advantage, the time scale separation in classical ESC scheme significantly limits ESC performance in terms of convergence speed [28,29]. The slow convergence of classical ESC may lead to sub-optimal control and may result in low control precision. To overcome this limitation, improved ESC scheme has been developed recently to improve the performance of ESC-based controller in terms of convergence speed [30,31]. At present, there have been a few studies investigating the performance of the improved ESC scheme for operation optimization of the HVAC components such as heat pump. For example, Cui et al. developed a phasor ESC controller to optimize the discharge pressure and medium pressure of an integrated subcooling transcritical heat pump water heater, and demonstrated higher optimization efficiency of the phasor ESC controller compared with the classical ESC [32]. Chakrabarty et al. accelerated the convergence speed of ESC scheme using Bayesian Optimization and adaptive moment-based optimization method, and applied the proposed ESC scheme for optimizing energy efficiency of heat pump [33]. In addition, Chakrabarty et al. combined proportional-integral ESC (PI-ESC) with a failure-robust Bayesian optimization algorithm to increase convergence speed and to avoid closed-loop instability, and applied the proposed ESC-based control strategy for energy optimization of a heat pump [34]. Even though convergence time is a significant performance criterion that determines the effectiveness of building thermal management, few studies reported the convergence-related property of ESC-based HVAC controller for optimizing building thermal environment. There have been only a few studies reported the convergence-related property of MPC based controller for building thermal management. For example, in the research by Yang et al. [35], it is reported that the convergence time was about 90 min for the MPC-based HVAC control conducted in an office in the campus of Nanyang Technological University in Singapore with a 5-min control interval. In the study by Drgoňa et al. [36], it is demonstrated that the convergence time of MPC-based HVAC control was about 100 min with a 15-min control interval in an existing 6-rooms terraced house in Bruges, Belgium. It is necessary to develop improved ESC scheme and to investigate the convergence-related property of the ESC-based scheme for online optimization of building thermal environment. According to the previous studies, there are mainly three research gaps that remain to be filled. Firstly, considering the model-free advantage of the ESC controller, it has the potential to be applied for real-time control of the complex building thermal environment. However, most studies investigated ESC performance for controlling HVAC components, few studies applied ESC-based control strategy for model-free control of thermal environment with complex indoor thermodynamics. Secondly, in order to ensure efficient thermal management in buildings, fast convergence speed of the ESC-based controller is required to promote accurate indoor thermal environment control. It is necessary to develop an improved ESC scheme improve the convergence speed of the controller and to investigate its performance for online optimization of building thermal environment. Thirdly, the unpredicted uncertainties resulting from time-varying weather conditions, occupancy rate, and measurement noise, etc., pose significant challenge to the performance of building thermal environment control. It is of great importance to investigate the robustness of the HVAC controller for building thermal management under uncertainty. In this study, an extended Kalman filter-based ESC controller (EKF-ESC) is developed for controlling indoor thermal environment to handle the uncertainties and to improve the convergence speed. The main contributions of this work are: 1) Fast convergence is realized through EKF-ESC by using the extended Kalman filter to estimate the gradient of the cost function. 2) The adaptivity of the EKF-ESC controller are evaluated under uncertain conditions with various weather conditions, electrical equipment and occupancy. In addition, the robustness of EKF-ESC is evaluated under different noise levels to investigate the application potential of the EKF-ESC controller. 3) A co-simulation platform combining EnergyPlus and Simulink/Matlab is developed for validation of EKF-ESC strategy, where the building system is simulated through EnergyPlus and the control scheme is realized based on Simulink/Matlab. 4) Performance comparison among EKF-ESC, classical ESC, and adaptive ESC (ESCAP) is conducted. 2 Method 2.1 Improved ESC-based control algorithm 2.2.1 Classical ESC The classical ESC algorithm aims to seek out the optimal control input u* to generate the minimum output y* for the system ( y = f ( u ) ) with unknown dynamics f through gradient-based optimization [16]. To obtain the gradient of system dynamics ( f \u2032 = d y d u ), a sinusoidal perturbation asin ( ω t ) is added into the control input ( u 0 ) as shown in Fig. 1 , leading to a sinusoidal output y ( t ) oscillating around the initial value y 0 ( y 0 = f ( u 0 ) ), as shown in Eq. (1). (1) y ( t ) = y 0 + f \u2032 ∙ asin \u2061 ( ω t ) The output y ( t ) is then passed through a high-pass filter (HP) to remove the low-frequency part while preserving the high-frequency part f \u2032 ∙ asin \u2061 ( ω t ) . Eq. (2) demonstrates the output y H ( t ) through a first-order high-pass filter G H . (2) y H ( t ) ≈ | G H | ∙ f \u2032 ∙ a ∙ sin \u2061 ( ω t + φ H ) where | G H | and φ H are the amplitude and phase of the high-pass filter G H . The output y H ( t ) is then multiplied by the high-frequency perturbation asin \u2061 ( ω t ) to generate the demodulated signal, as shown in Eq. (3). (3) y d ( t ) = y H ( t ) ∙ a ∙ sin ( ω t ) = f \u2032 | G H | a 2 2 [ cos ( φ H ) − cos ( 2 ω t + φ H ) ] To reduce the influence of the high-frequency component in Eq. (3), a low-pass filter (LP) GL is used and y L ( t ) is obtained, as shown in Eq. (4). (4) y L ( t ) = | G H | f \u2032 a 2 2 cos ( φ H ) As shown in Eq. (4), the output y L ( t ) is proportional to the gradient of the system f \u2032 . The value of y L ( t ) would decrease gradually as the system output converges to its optimal value. Then, the signal y L ( t ) is integrated to obtain the term Δ u ( t ) , which is a significant component in the control input u, as shown in Eq. (5). (5) u ( t ) = Δ u ( t ) + u 0 + a ∙ sin ω t There are three major time scales in the classical ESC framework that influence the operation efficiency of the classical ESC scheme, i.e., system dynamics, perturbation frequency ( ω ) and corner frequency of HP ( ω H ) . To ensure efficient operation of classical ESC algorithm, the perturbation frequency ω must be faster than the HP corner frequency ω H , but slower than the system dynamics. The time scale separation in classical ESC scheme significantly limits convergence speed of classical ESC method [18]. 2.2.2 Adaptive ESC (ESCAP) The ESCAP framework was firstly proposed by Wang et al., in 2016 [37], aiming at realizing a fast ESC control by automatically adjusting the perturbation amplitude. As shown in Fig. 2 , similar to classical ESC, ESCAP uses a combination of high- and low- pass filters to estimate the gradient of the cost function. The major difference between classical ESC and ESCAP is that the ESCAP adjusts the amplitude of the sinusoidal excitation signal adaptively to improve the performance of ESC (Fig. 2). To be specific, amplitude of the sinusoidal perturbation signal is dynamically adjusted according to the value of y L as shown in Eq. (6). (6) u ( t ) = Δ u ( t ) + u 0 + r y L ∙ sin ω t Where r is a positive constant and significantly influences the convergence speed. As shown in Eq. (6), the amplitude of the perturbation signal decreases with the decrease of y L P . Perturbation signal of large amplitude would be injected into the control input to accelerate the convergence speed when the control output is far away from the optimal value. On the other hand, the perturbation amplitude would converge to zero when the system output converges towards the optimum. According to the study by Wang et al., the ESCAP outperforms the classical ESC with faster convergence speed and has the advantage to avoid falling to local optimum during the online optimization process [37]. 2.2.3 EKF-ESC Classical ESC scheme uses a combination of high- and low- pass filters to estimate the gradient of the cost function. It should be noted that the perturbation frequency ω must be faster than the corner frequency of the HP but slower than the system dynamics in classical ESC algorithm, thus the convergence performance of the controller strongly depends on the dynamics of the controlled system. Different from the classical ESC scheme that uses a combination of high- and low- pass filters to estimate the gradient of the cost function, the EKF-ESC scheme uses an extended Kalman filter (EKF) instead [38]. EKF is an effective method for estimating unknown parameters [38] and the EKF-based gradient estimation in EKF-ESC scheme does not rely on the system dynamics, which provides an effective solution to overcome the time-scale separation problem in classical ESC scheme. Thus, the EKF-ESC scheme has faster convergence speed compared with the classical ESC controller. The diagram of the EKF-ESC scheme is shown in Fig. 3 . The estimated control output y ( t ) is obtained based on Eq. (7), which is then applied for establishing the state-space model for EKF. (7) y ( t ) = y 0 + f \u2032 ( u q ) u ( t ) where u q is quasi-steady component of control input. y 0 are the initial value of system output. f \u2032 is the slope of the unknown system. The unknown parameters f \u2032 ( u q ) and y 0 in Eq. (7) are defined as the states of the Kalman filter X that would be estimated and calculated based on the EKF method (i.e., x 1 = f \u2032 ( u q ) and x 2 = y 0 ). In this study, the major task of the EKF focuses on calculating the gradient information, i.e., x 1 . The observation and state-space equations are shown in Eqs. (8) and (9), respectively. (8) X ( t + 1 ) = ( x 1 ( t + 1 ) x 2 ( t + 1 ) ) = [ 1 0 0 1 ] X ( t ) + Q t (9) Y ( t ) = ( y ( t ) y ( t − n ) ) = ( u ( t ) 1 u ( t − n ) 1 ) X ( t ) + R t Where R and Q are the covariance matrix representing Gaussian white noise for state and observation equations. y ( t − n ) refers to the system output at previous n Δ t step, where Δ t is the sampling time. [ 1 0 0 1 ] represent the measurement matrix H . ( u ( t ) 1 u ( t − n ) 1 ) represent the state transition matrix F . The estimated x 1 (i.e., gradient of the static map, x 1 = f \u2032 ( u q ) ) could be calculated based on Eqs. (8) and (9) using EKF method, and then would be sent to the integrator to be added in the control input u based on Eq. (5). Pseudocode for the EKF-ESC algorithm is demonstrated in Algorithm 1. Algorithm 1 EKF-ESC scheme Image 1 2.2 Case description 2.2.1 Co-simulation platform A co-simulation platform is established by combining EnergyPlus and Simulink/Matlab, where the building system is simulated through EnergyPlus and the control scheme is realized based on Simulink/Matlab. The building simulation program is exported as a Functional Mock-up Unit (FMU) using the Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) standard. Then the FMU is be imported into Simulink/Matlab to construct the co-simulation platform (Fig. 4 ). The co-simulation platform in this study is used to validate the effectiveness of EKF-ESC scheme. To be specific, the Matlab/Simulink is used as the controller that is responsible for seeking out the optimal HVAC supply air temperature, while the EnergyPlus simulates indoor thermal environment and is used as the virtual sensor that provides control feedback for HVAC control. Data exchange between EnergyPlus and Matlab/Simulink is implemented at a 1-min time interval. 2.2.2 Description of the building thermal environment A five-room building model is created in EnergyPlus to simulate indoor temperature variations in various test cases. The weather data of Shanghai, a Chinese City located in Hot Summer/Cold Winter (HSCW) climate zone, is used for building simulation in this study. The weather data is the hourly Chinese Standard Weather Data (CSWD) developed by China Meteorological Bureau and Tsinghua University [39]. In addition, an east-facing room is selected to be used for investigating the effectiveness of the EKF-ESC scheme to include the thermal effect from both internal and external wall exposure. The outdoor weather conditions affect the indoor temperature directly through external wall exposure and indirectly through the internal wall exposure from the other rooms. In addition, indoor heat gains in the room mainly consist of heat gains from occupants and electrical equipment, which are operated according to the building schedule. 2.2.3 Control objective The HVAC control scheme runs on a 5-min time step. In this study, the control objective is to track the indoor temperature setpoints (T setpoint ) by adjusting the supply air temperature (T SA ), as shown in Eq. (10). (10) J = − ( T s e t p o i n t − T i n ) 2 The temperature setpoint T s e t p o i n t is set according to Ref. [40] as shown in Table 1 . In order to demonstrate the application potential of the proposed EKF-ESC controller, the indoor thermal environment is simulated and controlled under different conditions, as shown in Table 2 . To be specific, Case 1 describes EKF-ESC performance during a daily cycle to evaluate its control performance under a relatively stable environmental condition, where the uncertainties mainly arising from weather changes ( T i n = f w t ( T S A ) ). Case 2 focuses on investigating the adaptivity of the EKF-ESC scheme under the condition with presence of time-varying environmental disturbances from weather, occupancy and electrical equipment ( T i n = f w t , o c , e e p ( T S A ) ). In addition, Case 3 investigates robustness of the EKF-ESC under different noise levels ( T i n = f w t , o c , e e p , n o i s ( T S A ) ), since robustness to measurement noise is one of the greatest concerns in controller design. In addition, the control accuracy is evaluated in terms of cumulative regret, which represents the cumulative deviation of control output from the control target during the control period, as shown in Eq. (11). (11) C R ( τ ) = ∑ t = 1 τ ( | r o p t − r t | ) where τ represents the time duration of the control period. r o p t and r t represent temperature setpoint and the indoor temperature, respectively. 3 Results 3.1 Control performance under uncertainty 3.1.1 Case 1: Performance of the EKF-ESC controller In this section, EKF-ESC is applied for real-time control of indoor thermal environment in the co-simulation platform based on EnergyPlus and Simulink/Matlab. The control performance is evaluated under a relatively stable environmental condition, where the indoor heat gains from occupancy and electrical equipment remain unchanged (Fig. 5 ). As shown in Eq. (10), the aim of the EKF-ESC controller is to seek out the supply air temperature online to track the indoor temperature setpoints according to Table 1. The outdoor temperature is shown in Fig. 5a. In addition, the static map of indoor temperature is established as a function of time and HVAC supply air temperature (Fig. 5b), based on which the optimal value of HVAC supply air temperature during the daily cycle is calculated. Performance comparison among classical ESC, ESCAP, and EKF-ESC is demonstrated in Fig. 6 . As shown in Fig. 6, the classical ESC is observed to have the slowest convergence speed among the three ESC-based control strategies. About 5.2 h is required to reach the indoor temperature setpoint for classical ESC. This is because the convergence speed is limited by the indoor thermodynamics due to the time-scale separation problem in classical ESC. In addition, the slow convergence speed of classical ESC would induce long tracking time towards the optimum and lead to a lack of control precision as a result. Thus, it could be concluded that it is difficult to apply the classical ESC for effective control of building thermal environment in real applications. In Fig. 6, it could be observed that the ESCAP controller performs better than the classical ESC and it takes about 2.5 h for ESCAP to seek out the optimal indoor temperature setpoint. It should be noted that a significant difference between ESCAP and the classical ESC controller is that the perturbation amplitude of control input in ESCAP varies adaptively as shown in Fig. 6b. In ESCAP, the perturbation amplitude of control input decreases gradually according to control feedback and would finally converge to almost zero when the indoor temperature converges to the indoor temperature setpoint. The EKF-ESC controller operates by using the EKF for gradient estimation instead of the combination of high- and low- pass filters in classical ESC and ESCAP frameworks. It turns out that the EKF-ESC is capable of providing fastest gradient estimation compared with the classical ESC and ESCAP as shown in Fig. 6. According to Fig. 6, it takes less than 1 h for EKF-ESC to converge to the steady state. In addition, according to Fig. 6c, EKF-ESC is observed to have the highest control accuracy, and outperforms the other controllers (i.e., ESC and ESCAP) significantly over time. Therefore, it can be concluded that the EKF-ESC algorithm can provide effective HVAC control with improved convergence speed. 3.1.2 Case 2: Adaptivity of EKF-ESC to environmental disturbances In real applications, building thermal management is usually challenged by disturbances associated with the changes in weather conditions, electrical equipment, and occupant behavior. It is important to evaluate the adaptivity of the EKF-ESC controllers with presence of time-varying environmental disturbances. Weather conditions and the schedule of occupancy and electrical equipment are demonstrated in Fig. 7 a, and the static map of indoor temperature is established as a function of time and HVAC supply air temperature in Fig. 7b. To further describe the building thermodynamics under the effect of electrical equipment and occupancy, Fig. 7c demonstrates indoor temperature variation with fixed HVAC supply air temperature. It could be observed that the temperature in noontime during each day decreases due to the reduced indoor heat gains resulting from occupancy variations. In addition, it could also be observed that despite the high outdoor temperature of over 30 °C on Day 5 and Day 6, the indoor temperature on Day 5 and Day 6 is lower than most the other days under the same HVAC condition due to the effect of uncertainties causing by electrical equipment. This indicates that the disturbances, associated with weather conditions, electronic equipment and occupant behavior, have significant effects on indoor temperature. It is necessary to develop an adaptive control strategy that is able to handle the uncertainties in indoor environment and to ensure indoor thermal comfort. The control performance of EKF-ESC is demonstrated in Fig. 8 . It could be observed that the EKF-ESC has the capacity to adjust the HVAC temperature adaptively according to the building conditions to track the indoor temperature setpoints. For example, the supply air temperature is adjusted to approximately 21 °C and 19.5 °C on Day 0 and Day 3 respectively according to building conditions to track the target indoor temperature setpoint of 24 °C in daytime. As for classical ESC, Fig. 8 demonstrates that it performs better on Day 5 and Day 6 compared with the other test days in terms of convergence time. To be specific, the average convergence time for classical ESC is approximately 320 min on Day 5\u20136 and 350 min on the other days, respectively. This is because of the relatively stable building thermal environment without environmental disturbances causing by electrical equipment on Day 5\u20136, which reduces the difficulty to seek out the optimal operating point for classical ESC controller. Moreover, it should be noted that even though there is some improvement of convergence performance of ESCAP over the classical ESC, the low contorl accuracy limits the application of ESCAP in real applications. It could be concluded that it is difficult for ESC and ESCAP controller to handle the uncertainties in thermal environment. Fig. 8c shows that EKF-ESC has the highest control accuracy compared with the other controllers. Moreover, the control error distributions are demonstrated in Fig. 9 . The control errors for EKF-ESC, ESCAP, and EKF-ESC follow Gaussian distribution with the mean value of zero. It could be observed that the control error is smaller than 0.5 °C in most conditions for EKF-ESC, while the classical ESC controller suffers from low control accuracy with an obvious larger variance as shown in Fig. 9. The convergence time of the EKF-ESC, ESCAP, and classical ESC is summarized in Table 3 . EKF-ESC shows fastest convergence speed. It takes about 70 min for EKF-ESC to reach the convergence value, and about 77% and 55% reduction of the convergence time could be realized compared to the classical ESC and ESCAP controller. Moreover, the convergence time of about 70 min for EKF-ESC in this case with environmental disturbances is slightly higher than the convergence time of about 60 min under relatively stable environmental conditions in Case 1. The environmental disturbances slightly increase the convergence time for EKF-ESC controller. In addition, as shown in Table 3, the convergence time of EKF-ESC controller is about 18\u201345% shorter than the MPC controller in previous studies [35,36]. It could be inferred that the EKF-ESC operates in a model-free manner with a relatively fast response time. It should be noted that there are differences in building environments and control intervals in different studies, further studies that compare EKF-ESC with the other advanced controllers in different building environments should be conducted. 3.1.3 Case 3: Robustness of EKF-ESC to measurement noise To investigate the robustness of the EKF-ESC controller to measurement noise, we consider the control scenario with presence of noise in sensor measurement results, since robustness to measurement noise is one of the greatest concerns in controller design [41]. The noise is modeled by Gaussian distribution with a mean value of zero and a standard deviation of σ n o i s e , which is then added to the indoor temperature as measurement noise. Gaussian noises of different variance σ n o i s e 2 are investigated to analyze the robustness of the EKF-ESC controller to different noise levels. As shown in Fig. 10 a, despite different noise levels, EKF-ESC operates efficiently with good robustness to measurement noise. The EKF-ESC control under conditions with different noise levels shares the similar control output trajectory. In addition, the daily percentage of discomfort time is demonstrated under different noise levels as shown in Fig. 10b. The daily discomfort time accumulates when the control error ( e = | T i n d o o r − T s e t p o i n t | ) is over 1 °C. Fig. 10b demonstrates that the classical ESC performs with poor robustness to measurement noise. On the other hand, using EKF-ESC, the percentage of discomfort time slightly increases with the increase of noise level, demonstrating good robustness to measurement noise. 3.2 Performance comparison among different controllers In this section, EKF-ESC is compared with controllers including PI [42], PI-ESC [34] and ADAM-ESC [33]. PI is one of the most often used controllers for building thermal management in practice, while PI-ESC and ADAM-ESC are the state-of-art ESC-based control algorithms that have been developed recently. To be specific,PI-ESC controller in Ref. [34] uses the Bayesian-optimization-tuned ESC for online optimization of the parameters of PI controller. ADAM-ESC in Ref. [33] uses adaptive moment estimation (ADAM) to estimate the gradient in ESC algorithm. Fig. 11 demonstrates variations of indoor temperature under the control of EKF-ESC, PI, PI-ESC, and ADAM-ESC, respectively. As shown in Fig. 11, the convergence speed of EKF-ESC is obviously faster than the PI controller. This is because the parameters of PI controller are tuned under specific operational conditions, which makes it difficult to ensure optimal control performance in practice under complex HVAC operation conditions. The PI-ESC controller demonstrates much better performance compared with the PI controller, because ESC scheme is able to tune the parameter of PI controller adaptively in a model-free manner according to the time-varying building thermodynamics. However, despite the good performance of PI-ESC controller, Fig. 11 demonstrates that the PI-ESC controller might be strongly affected by the measurement noise. The control feedback oscillates around the indoor temperature setpoint with a standard deviation of about 0.94 K (Fig. 11a). On the other hand, the EKF-ESC method is more robust to the sensor noise and the standard deviation of indoor temperature under EKF-ESC control is about 49.8% lower than the PI-ESC controller. Moreover, the ADAM-ESC controller exhibits the longest convergence time among the four controllers in Fig. 11. This is because that the ADAM algorithm is characterized by small learning rate near optimum, which limits the convergence performance of ADAM-ESC for finding the optimal control input. 3.3 Practical implementations In real applications, the building thermal environment is subject to complex thermodynamics due to the uncertainties resulting from indoor activities, building renovation, and measurement noise, etc. The development of EFK-ESC has the potential for controlling building thermal environment due to the following three main advantages. Firstly, EKF-ESC has good adaptivity to environmental disturbances and uncertainties, and thus has the potential for building thermal management in practice. Secondly, EKF-ESC is robust to sensor noise, which could reduce the noise-induced instability in closed-loop control. Last but not least, the EKF-ESC has good control performance in terms of convergence speed. The application of the current study is mainly manifested in the following three aspects: 1) With the advantages shown above, the EKF-ESC controller is able to effectively improve thermal comfort performance in indoor environment under uncertainty. 2) The EKF-ESC controller has the potential to be used in fields that needs a fast convergence time to protect products, such as the museum and medicine manufacturing industry. 3) In addition to building thermal management, the EKF-ESC control strategy could be further extended to other control scenarios such as photovoltaic optimization. 4 Conclusion In this study, an improved ESC method by combining EKF and ESC algorithm is applied for online tracking of building indoor temperature setpoint. A co-simulation platform based on EnergyPlus and Simulink is established to investigate the application potential of the proposed control strategy. Performance comparison among EKF-ESC, classical ESC, and adaptive ESC (ESCAP) is conducted. Moreover, the adaptivity and robustness of the EKF-ESC controller are evaluated under the condition with time-varying environmental variations to investigate the application potential of the EKF-ESC controller. Our study demonstrates that the EKF-ESC controller performs well in terms of both convergence speed and control accuracy. The main findings of this study are summarized as follows: (1) EKF-ESC controller has good adaptivity to environmental disturbances associated with weather changes, indoor occupancy, and electrical equipment. (2) The EKF-ESC controller significantly improves the convergence performance for building thermal environment control compared to the classical ESC controller. About 77% and 55% reduction of the convergence time could be realized through EKF-ESC compared to the classical ESC and ESCAP scheme. (3) Using EKF-ESC, the daily percentage of discomfort time slightly increases with the increase of noise level, demonstrating good robustness to measurement noise.

        "dc:description": "Online optimization of building thermal environment is no trivial task due to the complex and uncertain indoor thermodynamics. In this study, an extended Kalman filter-based extremum seeking control (EKF-ESC) strategy for model-free control of thermal environment under uncertainty is proposed. The EKF-ESC uses extended Kalman filter for estimating gradient of the objective function of the extremum seeking controller, which enables real-time optimization of thermal environment with fast convergence time. In addition, a co-simulation platform is developed by combining EnergyPlus and Simulink/Matlab for validating effectiveness of the EKF-ESC strategy for controlling thermal environment. Our study demonstrates that the EKF-ESC strategy has good adaptivity to uncertainties resulting from changes in weather, electrical equipment and occupancy. Moreover, it is shown that the EKF-ESC is robust to measurement noise. In addition, comparison of convergence performance among EKF-ESC, adaptive ESC, and classical ESC is conducted. It is shown that the EKF-ESC based control strategy has the fastest convergence time towards indoor temperature setpoints. Compared with the classical ESC and adaptive ESC schemes, about 77% and 55% reduction of the convergence time are realized through EKF-ESC. According to the research results, it could be inferred that EKF-ESC strategy has the potential for effective building thermal management under uncertainty with fast convergence time.",
