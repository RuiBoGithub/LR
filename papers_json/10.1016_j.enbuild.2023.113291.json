To develop the data-driven control for future building operations, the building was designed with two systems: one system for \u201coperation\u201d and another \u201cresearch\u201d system to allow data acquisition, management, and separate commanding mechanisms.It includes the communication network, sensor network, building operations, and research network. The building was designed with multiple heating/cooling zones that can be controlled and commanded individually, as well as with a hybrid physical and virtual testbed to support algorithm testing. There are several applications that utilize this IoT architecture. First, an experiment that illustrates the testing and deployment of a data-driven algorithm using the hybrid physical and virtual testbed is described. Second, data-informed building energy management based on the IoT architecture is introduced. Third, augmented reality-based building operations and facility management is also discussed.

The concepts of an ultra-low energy building and a zero energy building [2] are therefore proposed, which may integrate multiple advanced low-energy building systems and passive technologies. However, such systems often face challenges in their controls. For example, it is complicated to control mixed mode ventilation in a building because of the complexity of the hybrid mechanical ventilation, natural ventilation systems, and coupled indoor and outdoor air flows and disturbances [3]. The integration of such systems, such as natural ventilation coupled with thermally active building systems (TABS), may also bring additional challenges to the coordinated control of different systems to maximize their operational performance [4]. The advent of the \u2018Internet of Things\u2019 (IoT) that seamlessly connects \u2018Operations Technology\u2019 (OT) elements, such as sensors, actuators, and controllers, with \u2018Information technology\u2019 (IT), including digital networks and algorithms, shows great potential to achieve the coordinated optimal operation of low-energy \u2018smart\u2019 buildings [5]. The IoT architecture of the smart building can be described with three layers, which include the perception layer, network layer, and application layer [6]. The perception layer is designed for data collection through sensing technologies. This usually includes wireless sensor networks, video cameras, radio frequency identification, a near field communication device, Global Positioning Systems, or other technologies. The network layer (also referred to as the transportation layer) is responsible for data communication between devices. This includes wired technologies, such as USB, Ethernet, Optic fiber, or Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line; and wireless technologies, such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, or Long-term evolution. The application layer serves as the top-level layer connected with end users and applications, such as energy management and environmental control. The IoT architecture in smart buildings has been utilized for various applications. Alletto, et al. [7] proposed a Bluetooth low-energy based system through wearable devices for localization of occupants in an IoT-enabled museum. The wearable devices tracked the location of the visitors and provided relevant information according to the location. Viswanath, et al. [8] developed an IoT-based system for energy management of residential buildings, which provided energy monitoring, automation and demand response, and home security. D'Elia, et al. [9] proposed a platform with environmental sensors to support smart building facility maintenance, which can detect abnormal operation and faulty equipment before notifying the building operator. In addition to better energy and facility management, occupants\u2019 thermal comfort can also be enhanced by IoT. For example, Bashir and Gill [10] proposed an integrated framework of IoT big data analytics to monitor and control the building systems, which supported decision-making when the data value was outside of the comfort range. Moreover, IoT-based approaches have also offered possibilities for occupant safety and health, as well as building structure safety. However, there are some limitations in the existing studies. First, very few studies propose the IoT architecture for integrated low-energy building systems (e.g., geothermal assisted TABS coupled with natural ventilation). Second, few studies have examined IoT architecture that allows experimentation in smart building operation, which is important for testing and demonstrating new algorithms and technologies. Third, most studies focused on a specific application, such as control or fault detection, and few have demonstrated a comprehensive capability of applications based on IoT architecture. To address these limitations, this paper describes the design of an IoT architecture that allows data-driven operations and experimentation in an ultra-efficient office building. The implemented IoT architecture is unique because it consists of two systems: one system for \u201coperation\u201d and another \u201cresearch\u201d system for data acquisition, management, and separate commanding mechanisms. This allows the researchers to study and test learning algorithms in the building with one single zone, multiple zones, or the entire building. Integrated with multiple low-energy technologies, the studied building also serves as a prototype for ultra-efficiency with IoT-enabled smart building architecture. In addition to the design of the IoT architecture, this paper also provides various applications demonstrated in the developed IoT architecture. 2 Design of the IoT architecture To accommodate data-driven experimentation, an infrastructure was developed in a lab building called HouseZero located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA [4,11] as shown in Fig. 1 . The original structure \u2013 a wood frame residential structure \u2013 was transformed into a research/office building, with meeting rooms, offices, workspaces, and novel heating/cooling technologies. The building has a three-floor structure and a basement with a total floor area of around 356 m2. The basement has a large meeting room, kitchenette, restrooms, and spaces that house mechanical systems and servers. Level 1 of the building has an administrative office, a meeting room, and a waiting area. Level 2 and Level 3 are mainly designed for open office and meeting rooms. The detailed description of the layout and functional distribution can be found in [4]. Refer to [11] for more information about the detailed materials of the lab building. The designed IoT architecture is composed of two layers as displayed in Fig. 2 : The \u201cnetwork topology\u201d layer (Section 2.1) and implementation layer. The \u201cnetwork topology\u201d layer includes thermal elements as physical devices, a communication network for data processing & transport and a sensor network for perception. Collectively, these elements establish the foundational infrastructure of the IoT architecture. The implementation layer utilizes this foundational infrastructure, and it contains the essential functionalities for building operation and experimentation (Section 2.2). This IoT architecture allows several applications to be tested and developed. This includes data-driven control, data-informed building management, and AR enhanced building operation and facility management. The design of the IoT architecture is introduced in this section in detail. The applications, presented in Section 3, will demonstrate the capabilities of the IoT architecture. 2.1 Network topology 2.1.1 Thermal elements As shown in Fig. 3 , HouseZero is an experimental, ultra-energy-efficient protype retrofit of a wood frame building on the periphery of the Harvard campus, with no conventional heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system. Instead, the indoor thermal comfort depends on natural ventilation, a solar chimney, automatic windows/skylight, automatic shading devices, solar PV and hot water, thermally active building systems for heating and cooling, geothermal wells, and an automatic lighting system. Indoor thermal comfort is driven by computational control of a number of pumps, valves, motors, and a heat pump, which are informed by readings from an embedded network of interior and exterior sensors [4]. Refer to [4] for more detailed information about the integrated low-energy building systems and controls. In addition to normal operation of the building, computational research is conducted at the building, focused on innovation in building design, materials, and technologies, as well as innovative approaches to real-time data-driven control of the heating/cooling systems coupled with natural ventilation. This work includes both simulations and computations such as Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms that may produce or require extremely large data files, which can benefit from high-bandwidth, fast network connections. The work also includes research into real-time computer simulation and control, including \u2018Mixed Reality (Augmented Reality (AR))\u2019 which benefits from extremely low-latency communications. Hence, the design of a specialized computing, communications, IoT, and multi-media-capable network is required in this building. 2.1.2 Communication network The needs of an IoT \u2013 including elements of the structure, from thermostats to occupancy sensors and outdoor wind-pressure sensors, as well as connections to remote web resources \u2013 coupled with reasonable security and reliability concern calls for a more complex network than would typically be provided for an ordinary residential, academic, or commercial structure. The building\u2019s network and IoT infrastructure are designed to support HouseZero\u2019s academic and research activities and needs, including ordinary computing/communications needs of staff, as well as computationally intensive research computing activities (e.g. real-time simulations and model-based data-driven control of building heating and cooling systems) by researchers, a dense network of attached and embedded sensors throughout the structure, inside and out, and novel heating/cooling equipment operations such as motorized windows and a low-temperature high-efficiency heat pump. All IT and IoT electronic components were vetted for their energy-consumption specifications, while also accommodating for high throughput and connectivity over several network protocols (principally TCP/IP for ordinary data/telecommunications and multimedia, BACNet [12] and KNX [13] for building automation (BA) components). As shown in Fig. 4 , HouseZero is connected with the Harvard University campus-wide local-area network (LAN) for general-purpose telecommunications, both wired and wirelessly, via the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) over ethernet (universal standard networking technology). In order to provide greater security over network traffic within and outside of the structure, the building network is further segmented into several distinct private local-area networks, or \u2018Virtual LANs\u2019 (VLANs), managed by the University\u2019s central IT department, HUIT. VLANs define a specified range of device Internet Protocol (IP) addresses that are all connected inside a closed network that is otherwise inaccessible to other devices/IP addresses, without specific permissions being granted. HouseZero VLANs include both routable/global IP addresses (of the form 128.x.x.x, that can be accessed by other IP devices anywhere on the global Internet) and un-routable/local addresses (of the form10.x.x.x, that can only be accessed by other devices physically or logically connected to the segmented subnet) for security, privacy, and higher speeds due to reduced traffic on the restricted subnets. The devices on segmented VLANs with un-routable 10.x.x.x addresses are protected from ever being exposed on the open Internet, which is a normal security provision for sensitive information or, in this case, critical operational devices. HUIT technologists were consulted on the design of the network system, in addition to overseeing installation contractors and retaining administrative management and maintenance control of the network architecture and components. The building main fiber-optic feed from the HUIT core network enters an adjacent building\u2019s basement-level network closet and intermediate distribution frame (IDF) physically secure rack of equipment; from there, an underground 4\u2033 conduit carries the 6-strand MultiMode fiber optimized to work with fiber optic into the building\u2019s basement-level under-stairs network closet and IDF. All internal cabling in the building is Category 6 Augmented (CAT6A) cable, with nearly twice the bandwidth and distance limitation of standard CAT6 cabling, in order to support high-bandwidth data requirements from high-frequency real-time data sensors, large files required by or generated by computer simulations such as Clustered File Systems (CFS), and multimedia/video/image files. The HouseZero network closet (IT servers) houses the IDF or \u2018network/telecommunications rack\u2019 for all HouseZero network components, primarily a managed central switch: a 10 GB 144-port high-capacity Aruba switch (Model 5412), with redundant power supplies and both 10 GB/sec (10 Gbps) and 1 GB/sec (1 Gbps) Power-Over-Ethernet (POE) ports (cable connections). HouseZero\u2019s desks, offices, and workspaces are equipped with \u201cVoice-Over-IP\u201d (VOIP) POE telephones and some other devices that can only handle 1Gbps maximum bandwidth, so the Aruba Model 5412 managed central switch supports 48 ports for those devices at 1Gbps and an additional 96 ports at 10Gbps. Between computer workstations, various IoT devices, and office telephones, about half of these ports are utilized, and about half remain available for future expansion. The building contains 52 RJ-45 (standard) Ethernet jacks (outlet plugs) for general computing & communications. All Ethernet jacks are POE 1Gbps or 10Gbps jacks capable of supporting VOIP telephony as needed at any of the 20 workstation locations. The Cisco POE-powered VOIP phone-sets in use are limited to 1Gbps connections; 10Gbps connections are reserved for administrative and research computer workstations and multimedia content. The 10Gbps Network supports distributed high-powered computation and visualization software, such as airflow analysis, simulations, and optimization. High-resolution digital imagery and video data are also supported. The building network closet also houses other electrical control panels, where individual cables and twisted-pair wires from devices and sensors terminate and are converted into IP over the network. A local Uninterruptable Power Supply (UPS) backup system was not included in the building design in order to save space and reduce the cooling and electrical load on the building. Power backup is provided by the battery system in the building that can operate most of the essential loads and is designed for experimentation. Secure wired and wireless access is controlled by a centralized computer registry, tied to Harvard\u2019s identity and authentication system \u2018HarvardKey\u2019, with strict and fine-grained access, authorization, and security and encryption controls, including two-factor authentication, to prevent unauthorized or malicious access or interception of data. 2.1.3 Sensor network The building is monitored with an extensive sensor network of over 300 sensors and meters. This includes outdoor sensors, such as ambient temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and direction, and solar radiation; indoor sensors, such as air temperature, relative humidity, carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration, occupancy, slab temperature, and wall surface temperature; and sensors and meters for the systems, such as BTU meters and electrical meters. Refer to [4] for detailed descriptions of the sensor network. The building contains several linear kilometers of Cat6A and other RS485 (serial protocol) twisted pair wiring, primarily connecting the sensors and actuators for building components\u2019 monitoring and control. Most sensors are hard-wired to BACNet and KNX network lines, connected through junctions, field panels, and adapters to controllers. At the time of planning and construction, the building\u2019s architectural ultra-energy-efficient design required strict minimization of air-infiltration, with thermal bridges through wall penetrations from the exterior minimized. All data jacks, cabling, and sensor locations were carefully specified and detailed before construction. No exposed cabling or wire trays were included in the interior design, so all cables and conduits are embedded in wood-frame wall cavities using conventional energy-conscious installation standards. There are two categories of uses for the sensors: operation and research. Operational sensors include basic indoor slab and air temperatures, local zone thermostats, CO2 sensors to evaluate occupancy, and the local weather station for temperature, rain, etc. These are sufficient for the rule-based algorithm used for heating and cooling operation of the geothermal heat-pump, motorized windows, and solar thermal vent. The HouseZero research agenda includes a finer-grained and more extensive set of sensors, including both low-height (below the knee) and high-height (above the head) temperature sensors, to detect stratification in various spaces, as well as low-velocity air-motion sensors to detect air movement and buoyancy-effect drafts throughout the structure and calibrate simulation measurements. BTU-sensors are attached to the several heating zones, tubing, manifolds, and valves to better understand the distribution of heat along with fluid flows and temperatures. Similarly, each electrical circuit in the structure is independently metered, as is each solar panel, to measure its production over time. A redundant whole-building meter provides a check on the aggregate of individual readings. These research sensors are used to gather data for analysis and support building research-based operations using the data-driven approach. 2.2 Implementation The implementation layer translates the components of the thermal elements, communications network, and sensor network above into functionalities that allow building operation and experimentation. The two main functionalities include the Building Operations and Research Networks, which are described in Section 2.2.1. In addition, a hybrid physical and virtual testbed/digital twin (Section 2.2.2) was also implemented to extend the functionalities and capabilities of the IoT architecture. 2.2.1 Building operations and research networks As shown in Fig. 5 , the building network infrastructure is divided into two separate but overlapping networks: an Operations Network which directly manages critical IoT equipment such as valves, motorized windows, and a heat-pump; and a Research network which supports researchers\u2019 communications (internal and external), some sensors and equipment not directly connected to building operations, and high-performance computing such as CFD simulation and analysis. Some HouseZero embedded sensors (e.g., thermostats) are directly tied to equipment operations; others are more general purpose (e.g., occupancy) or special-interest (e.g., air-flow) sensors supporting research activities. As a start, the building will need to operate using existing commercial rule-based software (referred to as Building Automation Server 1 (BAS-1)). A separate system was designed to be integrated with the commercial software to be able to acquire data, store it, and control and command the building as needed based on evolving research with the intention of experimenting with replacing the commercial software overtime using data driven algorithms. The commercial software and its controllers use KNX network. The other system \u201cSiemens'Desigo\u201d (refer to as Building Automation Server 2 (BAS-2)) uses BACnet networks. Both systems have to interface with each other to operate the building, so processes were developed for such interfacing. A third separate and independent system was designed to fetch the data from theDesigo system (real-time data and historical data), allow functional protocols to be used to command the building through theDesigo server, andbypassthe commercial software. 2.2.1.1 Operations network The building functional heating/cooling components (sensors, valves, window motors, et al.) are interconnected on a restricted-access \u2018Operations\u2019 network, using both Ethernet/IP (for TCP/IP communications, and connection to the Internet, as streams of packets of information) and twisted-pair local wiring as appropriate (such as for individual sensors, motors, valves, et al. which operate on a purely electrical voltage rather than a stream of packets). This operations network is partitioned into two distinct restricted access secure VLANs (with a capacity of 30 hosts per each subnet): \u2022 Outdoor and indoor temperatures, as well as HouseZero Electrical, Lighting, and other systems, are monitored and controlled by BAS-2, using IP and BACNet, in the secure \u2018BAS-2 VLAN # 1\u2032; \u2022 Window Motors, heating/cooling zone valves, and CO2 and other sensors and systems are monitored and controlled by BAS-1, in the secure \u2018BAS-1 VLAN #2\u2032. \u2018Secure\u2019 in this sense means that these networks are logically, and even physically, disconnected from any other network, and controlled by a \u2018Firewall\u2019 or \u2018Access Control Lists\u2019 (ACLs) that limit which devices or machines can connect to the network. This limits the potential for outside malicious (hacker) interference in HouseZero operations; increasingly, IoT implementations may be the target of malicious exploits, and so are best not left exposed on the open web. BAS-1 motorized window controllers and sensors use standard KNX protocols. All control logics are implemented in this server and then provided to the BAS-2 system for commanding only the heating and cooling of the building. BAS-2 devices primarily use BACNet controls. KNX-BACNet and KNX-IP gateways are used for interconnection, converting from BACNet and KNX device-specific protocols to IP for general network transmission. BACNet and KNX are both \u2018serial\u2019 protocols, which means that devices can be \u2018daisy-chained\u2019 together, on a single continuous loop of wire. Individual devices each have a unique ID that they inject into the signal stream along with other data, so the controller can uniquely identify each sensor reading or direct each control command to a specific device. These two protocols were implemented so that the building can experiment with eliminating the commercial rule-based software using a data-driven algorithm that will use the BACNet BAS-2 as a medium to run zones in the building. The components within VLAN1 are accessible via protocols to allow direct data retrieval, as well as the monitoring and commanding of sensors, motors, and other IoT devices for research proposes. A research server was developed that interacts with BAS-2 and enables researchers to have direct control of sensors, motors, and other IoT devices via a webservice Application Programmer\u2019s Interface (API). 2.2.1.2 Research network HouseZero\u2019s research workspaces are interconnected with 10 GB Cat6A wired Ethernet and 5 GHz WiFi throughout, supporting telecommunications, multimedia, and high-end visualization and simulation software. The building\u2019s research network is designed to support research and is connected to the research server. The building research server supports the deployment of a special purpose API, written in Python, to permit controlled access from the outside world (e.g., remote research collaborators) to selectively read specified elements of the building research and operations data. This research server connects to the research network, which uses BACNet controls that are not primarily related to the operation of the building. The controls support the research enterprise of developing in-house algorithmic control systems, ultimately intended to bypass the existing commercial server\u2019s software currently required to operate the building. This is done by allowing direct connections to IoT components that includes direct monitoring and control of devices, such as temperature sensors and electronic valve controls. Machine Learning (ML) techniques are used to analyze and learn from the building\u2019s real-time and archival data, in order to develop real-time operational control of all zones. HouseZero sensor data is collected at various frequencies and intervals, including: some data collected once per second, other data points collected every 60 s, and some data collected every 15 min of every day or per change of state. The capability for extremely high temporal resolution (e.g., one measurement per second) is built into the operational apparatus for the building; in fact, the operational data that controls the building\u2019s thermal regime is used across a range of frequencies, from per-second to hourly. Control of the Automated Building Management System at HouseZero is currently divided between BAS-2 and BAS-1. The BAS-1 system is a rule-based system responsible for, among other things, actuation of motorized windows based on CO2, occupancy sensors, and calling for heating or cooling based on weather forecast data. BAS-2 system monitors all sensors, controls some systems, stores all sensor data for analysis, commands the heating and cooling, and connects to the Harvard University central FMO Building Automation system. HouseZero also contains a workstation, used for the monitoring and visualization of building performance with commercial data visualization and control software. BAS-2 is a moderately-powered server connected to the Harvard LAN for remote management and backup by the HUIT team. BAS-1 is a normal workstation connected to the Harvard LAN for remote management from the HUIT team, and for nightly backup. It has 2 separate NICs; one for connection to the Operations network, and one for BAS-1 proprietary connectivity. The first Network configured on BAS-1 Private Network (10.xxx) is for connection to sensors, motors, and valves; the second Network configured on BAS-2 Operations VLAN is for data transmission into the BAS-2 system. BAS-2 and BAS-1 VLANs are tightly restricted, with no outside access except for strictly limited firewall-controlled access to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Weather Web Service and Solar PV monitoring applications in the cloud. In addition, HouseZero maintains a separate \u2018Research Server\u2019 (a Virtual PC in HUIT-managed Amazon Cloud), called the \u201cHouseZero Research Command System\u201d (HRCS), for testing and development purposes. HRCS interfaces with HouseZero building systems to retrieve selected data points in real-time or historical trends via API from BAS-2 database. In addition, HRCS is enabled to securely fetch from outside sources such as NOAA, etc. and to send commands via API to all remotely controlled devices and components, converting to BACNet or KNX as required. Remote access to all above servers is controlled and secured through a \u2018Jump_Server topology [14] and a two-step process. Remote users first connect through Harvard\u2019s secure virtual private network (VPN) with Remote Desktop technology to a hardened and isolated \u2018Jump Server\u2019 (with a limited number of users, all with two-factor authentication), in the Amazon AWS cloud. From that box, the remote users then initiate a connection over Remote Desktop protocol to the BAS-2, BAS-1, or HRCS research server. Strict IT security rules, including strong passwords, two-factor authentication, carefully regulated roles and permissions with separate \u2018Admin\u2019 level accounts, and other rules, as specified by HUIT\u2019s IoT rules and OT protocols, are overseen by HUIT service. 2.2.1.3 Operations and research dataflow As shown in Fig. 6 , HouseZero has two distinct control systems: BAS-1, which uses the KNX protocol, and BAS-2, which uses the BACnet protocol. Each system has both physical input and output devices, including a temperature sensor, CO2 sensor, electric circuit meters, PV system, valves, and window actuators. Data from the sensor is first stored at the panel level. Then, at a defined frequency, this data is collected to the software applications on the two BAS PCs. The commands are sent to the actuators from each software application. Two systems are connected by two pairs of gateways converting BACnet IP to KNX serial and KNX serial to KNX IP. One pair is assigned for lighting communication, and another is assigned for the rest of the communication. The system is expandable to 3rd party systems and applications inside and outside HUIT and the HouseZero network via the HRCS research server. The HouseZero lab was undertaken to research, test, and demonstrate the benefits of novel heating and cooling technologies and materials. A thrust of the research program is focused on the \u2018Control System\u2019 that takes real-time readings of critical values and adjusts two key components \u2013 geothermal water flow and window opening/closing \u2013 to keep the interior in the comfort zone under the conditions with various uncertainties [4,15,16]. The data analysis and data-driven software development utilize the HRCS, developed by the research team. Developed in Python on the HRCS research server, the system interfaces with the HouseZero building systems to read (\u201cget data\u201d) from a range of sensors and write (\u201csend commands\u201d) to actuators that control the flow of water and air used for heating and cooling. HRCS uses standard Web Services technology to connect to the BAS-2, which relays information from sensors, and send commands to actuators via BACnet, through the BAS-1 and KNX, to the window sensors and motors. The system relies on a database of \u2018points\u2019 (data sources, sensors, and actuators) that can be read and/or written to. Each point holds three name-value pairs for addressing: { \u201cname\u201d: Display name of the point, \u201cpath\u201d: Path to the data point in BAS-2, \u201cpoint\u201d. Point name in BAS-2} For example: {\u201cname\u201d: \u201cRm0 South Wall Temp\u201d, \u201cpath\u201d: \u201cBACnetNetwork1.Hardware.HS_ZERO_NODE_01.Local_IO\u201d, \u201cpoint\u201d: \u201cHVD_ZERO_RM0_2_SOUTH_WALL_TMP\u201d}, The two essential function calls are getValue(path, point) and setValue(path, point, value), which read and return a sensor (point) value, or write data to an actuator (point), and return any error codes. For example: \u2022 getValue(\u2018BACnetNetwork1.Hardware.BAS-1_Gateway.Local_IO\u2019, \u2018Z31_RH\u2019) would return the relative humidity for Zone 31. \u2022 setValue(\u2018BACnetNetwork1.Hardware.WM_BACnet_Gateway.Local_IO\u2019, \u2018Z31_SKYLIGHT\u2019, \u201850\u2032) would open the Zone 31 skylight to 50%. This infrastructure provides a powerful tool for experimentation, not only for HouseZero\u2019s researchers internally, but also for remote researchers using secure VPN connections to interrogate (quarry and trending real-time data or historical data) and command the building from afar. Individual actuators, such as valves controlling the flow of water from the heat pump, can be combined into \u2018zones\u2019, as in traditional building heating systems, which can have different profiles and behavior due to the distributed sensor system. The algorithms and logic within the HRCS are the innovation that sits upon the framework of the HouseZero technical infrastructure. Functional programing, Machine Learning, and close to real-time simulation are examples that are combined in the HouseZero research program to provide better control and effective energy-efficiency management. This network of readable/controllable \u2018points\u2019 forms the base of the \u2018Digital Twin\u201d of HouseZero that can be isolated in simulations and experimented on. The building\u2019s modular and exposed structure and wiring make it possible to incrementally experiment with heating/cooling components and control logics, especially the third floor\u2019s \u2018Live Lab\u2019 which provides a valuable testbed for hybrid (mixed digital/analog) experimental components and control systems. HouseZero\u2019s building monitoring system is largely based on the BAS-2 system. Pre-set alarms on temperature conditions and equipment status are monitored and automatic emails are sent to appropriate individuals in the event of a building emergency or heating/cooling/electrical failure. The building is also direct-wired to Facilities Maintenance Operations (FMO) for fire alarm and suppression systems (sprinklers), an alarm system, and an emergency lighting system with a dedicated battery backup system as a life/safety precaution. The HouseZero Sensor Network has the capacity to read thousands of samples per hour, and store them to a local hard disk in BAS-2. 24-hour backups are copied to the HUIT Amazon/AWS Cloud. Researchers can access historic data at various levels of aggregation, and these can be used in trending analyses and for verification and calibration of simulations. A repository is maintained for data to be shared with the research community. 2.2.2 Hybrid physical and virtual testbed The big data generated by the extensive sensor network in HouseZero enables the researchers to experiment with developing advanced learning-based control algorithms to improve building operations in new ways. A hybrid physical and virtual testbed has been implemented based on the IoT infrastructure to provide additional capabilities of testing the learning-based control algorithms comprehensively and reliably. As shown in Fig. 7 , the proposed learning-based control algorithms can be firstly evaluated on the virtual testbed using different scenarios with controlled boundary conditions. The selected algorithms can then be tested on the physical testbed (\u2018Live Lab\u2019) on the third floor of the building. Once deemed successful within the smaller scale of the \u2018Live Lab\u2019, the algorithms can be deployed on multiple zones or throughout the entire building to evaluate their effectiveness in real operation. After demonstrating the success of the technologies in HouseZero, the technologies will be assessed with the virtual testbed for their potential performance, as well as their impacts if being applied to different building types and at different locations in scale. 2.2.2.1 Physical \u2018Live Lab\u2019 infrastructure A special feature of the building is an experimental apparatus known as the third floor \u2018Live Lab,\u2019 as shown in Fig. 8 . The south end of the top floor of the structure is designed to be somewhat thermally isolated from the rest of the structure, which allows for isolated control over its heating and cooling zones by controlling plumbing valves. The plumbing valves are designed to feed the tubing inside the thermal slab from the geothermal heat pump or from solar thermal. The \u2018Live Lab\u2019 also allows for the replacement of and experimentation with elements of the south facade and exterior wall and windows. This feature can be used to run extended experiments with new materials, components, devices, algorithms, and control systems, as well as to test these items in a relatively isolated manner from the rest of the structure. For example, the room heating and cooling thermal zone can be programmed to use real-time data to switch between and combine fluid from the geothermal system and from the solar hot water panels on an experimental basis. They can also be turned off to run experiments using other means for cooling and heating. Network connections to the \u2018Live Lab\u2019 are ordinary 1 GB and 10 GB data jacks on a separate controlled VLAN. Data from the \u2018Live Lab\u2019 is stored in BAS-2 database, or directly on attached devices and storage as appropriate. This isolated physical testbed is not regularly occupied by HouseZero staff, leaving the room free for experimentation. 2.2.2.2 Digital twin virtual testbed A digital twin model of the third floor \u2018Live Lab\u2019 has been developed to serve as a virtual testbed in conjunction with the physical testbed. The model is implemented in Modelica as shown in Fig. 9 , which is linked with control algorithms implemented in Python through a customized interface based on the \u201cPython36\u201d module developed in the Modelica Buildings library [17]. The modeled room has a floor area of 8.18 m2 with a height of 3.84 m. The exterior constructions include a south wall and window, a roof, and a skylight. A concrete layer has been added to the slab, forming a high level of thermal mass. Radiant tubes are embedded in the slab, with hot water supplied by a ground source heat pump. Refer to [4] for more detailed description of the building and systems. The inputs of the room model include supply water temperature and flow rate of the radiant heating system. The outputs include the room temperature, slab temperature, and return water temperature. The heat and mass balance of the room is modelled based on the MixedAir module in Modelica Buildings library [17]. The partition walls are modelled with adiabatic boundary conditions since the adjacent rooms are conditioned with the same setpoints as the studied room. The floor is modeled as a construction with water piping embedded. Refer to [15] for more information about the settings of the Modelica model. The room model is calibrated and validated with high-fidelity measured data collected and stored through the developed IoT architecture from HouseZero. The measured data in December 2020 is divided into two parts, in which the data from December 1st to 15th is used for calibration and the data from December 16th to 31st is used for validation. The Mean Absolute Errors (MAE) are used as the metrics to evaluate simulation accuracy. It has been found that the MAEs are less than 1 °C for all the parameters for both calibration and validation. A detailed comparison of the measured and predicted values is shown in Fig. 10 . The predictions and measurements are in agreement for all the parameters for both calibration and validation. There are a limited number of studies reporting a detailed calibration and validation of the transient heat transfer process of a radiant heating or cooling system in a real building, such as [18] and [19]. The performance presented in this study achieves a similar or better accuracy compared to them. Moreover, the high fidelity of the development and validation of the digital twin relies on the capability of the implemented IoT architecture with its extensive sensor network. 3 Applications While the developed IoT architecture has a multitude of potential applications, three applications were selected to holistically demonstrate the capabilities of the developed IoT architecture from varied perspectives. Each of these applications leverages the unique features of the developed IoT architecture. The first application illustrates the use of the hybrid physical and virtual testbed to support the development of advanced learning-based control algorithms. The second application demonstrates the ways in which data and model integration can enhance building energy management. The third application unveils a novel Augmented Reality (AR) enhanced approach to aid building operations and facility management. 3.1 Data-driven control experimentation In this section, a case study using deep learning-based model predictive control for automatic window operations using the IoT architecture presented above is introduced. The developed adaptive model predictive control (AMPC) algorithm utilizes a Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep learning model that is constantly updated with new data during the online stage for identifying thermal dynamics and CO2 trends. A multi-objective optimization problem was formulated to optimize the indoor air quality, thermal comfort, and energy efficiency. A rule-based control (RBC) is included as a baseline. If indoor air temperature (Troom ) is higher than 22 °C and indoor CO2 concentration is larger than 800 ppm, the window will be opened with degree of uangle , which depends on the outdoor air temperature (Tout ); otherwise, the window will remain closed. The conventional model predictive control (MPC) is also included as a benchmark, which utilizes the same LSTM model but does not update the model during the online stage. Refer to [16,20] for a more detailed description of the developed control algorithms. The developed control algorithm was first tested on the virtual testbed and then deployed through the research server and network on the third floor \u2018Live Lab\u2019 of HouseZero. The metrics to evaluate the performance of the algorithm included distribution of indoor temperature and CO2 concentration (e.g., percentage of hours when temperature was lower than 19 °C or the CO2 was higher than 1000 ppm), representing the satisfaction regarding thermal comfort and indoor air quality (IAQ). The control performance of each controller was compared and is presented in Table 1 . It is found that the MPC and AMPC are more effective in maintaining indoor CO2 concentrations below 800 ppm, achieving 96.6% and 92.5% of the simulation period, respectively. In contrast, RBC is less effective, achieving only 69.1% and adopting the MPC and AMPC results in 3% and 6.6% of the simulated time under high CO2 conditions respectively. In contrast, using the RBC leads to 24.6% of the simulated time under high CO2. By analyzing the unmet conditions when the CO2 is higher than 1000 ppm, MPC controllers results in less than 1% of simulated time with unmet conditions. In contrast, the RBC gives rise to 6.3% of simulation period with unmet CO2 conditions, which is approximately 7 times higher than the AMPC, as well as about 15 times more compared with the basic MPC. The controllers were also evaluated in terms of indoor air temperature control, in addition to indoor CO2 levels. The results indicate that AMPC provides significant advantages in terms of maintaining a comfortable and stable indoor thermal environment. During the 2-month simulation period, the AMPC system resulted in only 5.1 occupied hours below 19 °C, which is 93% lower compared to basic MPC. This improvement can be attributed to the adaptive system dynamics model used in AMPC, which allows for real-time adjustment of control strategies in response to changes in the system. Therefore, the control performance of AMPC is superior to that of basic MPC by considering both indoor air quality and thermal comfort. Based on the simulation results, the AMPC algorithms were deployed into the \u2018Live Lab\u2019 for physical experiment testing. To deploy the learning algorithms in the \u2018Live Lab,\u2019 the past data of the last 150 min is downloaded from the HRCS, which includes the room temperature of the target and adjacent zones, zone CO2 level, outdoor dry-bulb temperature, wind direction, wind speed, solar radiation, and window opening percentage. The forecast data for the next 300 min is downloaded from the NOAA API web service. The hourly weather forecast data includes outdoor dry-bulb temperature, wind direction, wind speed, and sky conditions. Two linear models are trained using historical weather data from Boston Logan International Airport and the local weather station to calibrate wind speed and solar radiation. The models localize wind speed and calculate solar radiation from time and the sky conditions given in the weather forecast. The commands for the next 15 min are sent to actuators via HRCS. The lab experiments involved the implementation of two different control algorithms: AMPC as a learning-based algorithm and the RBC as a baseline. Outdoor weather conditions on the two experiment days are depicted in Fig. 11 . Fig. 11 (a) shows that during the AMPC experiment, the air temperature fell in a range between −3°C to 0 °C, and the solar radiation was very low. These conditions indicate a very cold outdoor environment with limited solar heat gain to assist with regulating the indoor air temperature. The RBC was tested on a day with comparatively higher outdoor air temperature and solar radiation, as shown in Fig. 11 (b). Experiment results with the RBC and AMPC in two workdays are shown in Fig. 12 . For RBC, by having the window operation schedule and opening degree (Fig. 12 (b)), the indoor air temperature (Fig. 12 (a)) is well-controlled and maintained within the comfortable range of 23 °C to 25 °C, and most of the occupied hours were maintained around 25 °C. However, an analysis of CO2 levels (Fig. 12 (a)) revealed that during 31.2% of occupied hours, the concentration exceeded 800 ppm. For AMPC, by implementing the window operation schedule (Fig. 12 (d)), the indoor environment is effectively maintained at a stable and comfortable condition, both in terms of indoor air quality and thermal comfort. As shown in (Fig. 12 (c)), the variation of indoor air temperature stays within the range between 24 °C and 25 °C, while the CO2 concentration always remained below 800 ppm throughout the occupied hours. In terms of energy efficiency, due to the delay of heat transfer from hot water in the radiant heating system to indoor air, the average heating loads between 8 AM on the day of the experiment and 8 AM on the following day are calculated. The heating loads of RBC and AMPC are found to be 0.177 kW and 0.197 kW, respectively. Given the outdoor weather conditions on the RBC experiment day were warmer, it is reasonable to conclude that AMPC with multi-objective control optimization is effective in significantly improving the indoor environment without compromising energy consumption. Compared to the previous research that explored the performance of MPC for window control based on a simulated environment [16,21], this study provides evidence of the effectiveness of the advanced window control methods in a real building, taking advantage of the IoT architecture. 3.2 Data-informed building energy management Enabled by an IoT architecture, a data-informed building energy management (DiBEM) framework was proposed to improve the building\u2019s energy efficiency, which was found to lead to an energy use intensity (EUI) reduction from 54.1 kWh/m2 to 42.8 kWh/m2 [22]. The proposed DiBEM aims to provide a lightweight, easy-to-implement, and semi-automatic solution to help buildings improve operational energy efficiency through the automatically generated regular energy report with data-driven model predictions as references. The proposed DiBEM identifies the energy-saving potential or system operation faults through data and models. In addition to a simple analytic model (e.g., linear regression model), which can be directly implemented on the BAS-2 system, it also supports complex machine learning models to be involved in the DiBEM via communication between the BAS-2 system and the research server through API. An alert of system faults will be sent to the building operators through emails, who will then investigate the issues and act accordingly. This timely notification based on close monitoring of building performance helps maintain high energy efficiency throughout the operation phase. Refer to [22] for a detailed description of the DiBEM and more application results in HouseZero. Fig. 13 shows an example of model-based automatic fault detection for the PV system. The metric to evaluate the model\u2019s performance is the effectiveness of the model to identify faults. A polynomial regression model was developed using historical data to predict the PV production based on solar radiation data. The model prediction was utilized as a reference to identify the abnormal operation of the PV system. It was found that on February 14th and 15th, the measured PV production was much lower than the reference threshold, which indicated that there may be issues in the PV system. This alert was sent to building operators, and further measures were conducted after looking into the system issues. This case demonstrates an example of building energy management enhanced by data and models. As many different methods for DiBEM (e.g., model-based fault detection [23]), have been developed in previous research, the IoT architecture of this lab building allows the development and implementation of these methods with the capacity of adding different complexity. 3.3 Augmented Reality enhanced building operations and facility management Using the IoT architecture implemented, AR-based experimentation and deployment were able to be conducted. AR at HouseZero enables the superimposition of annotations, information from sensors, or information from simulations to the physical world. It facilitates the inspection of individual systems of the building and allows information to be visualized in selected real-world locations, providing a seamless connection of the digital with the physical. A series of AR applications were developed for HouseZero using the gaming engine Unity 3d and targeting a commercial headset. Fig. 14 illustrates the structure of the AR applications and the communication with other components at HouseZero. Three-dimensional models and UI elements are permanently aligned to the appropriate real-world locations using Spatial Anchors. The headset apps can access HouseZero systems and other research frameworks through the HRCS server. The metric to evaluate the performance of the developed AR application is the capability and possible application as demonstrated in Fig. 15 . The first application focuses on the identification and localization of hardware components that are a part of complex assemblies. More specifically, a location with plumbing systems was selected (Tech Closet). A high-accuracy, three-dimensional model of the plumbing was obtained using laser scanning. Using Unity 3d, a series of scripts were attached to the geometries to handle proper real-world alignment and user interaction. In the resulting application, the 3d models remain invisible, except for when they are interacted with. The AR application affords interactions through gaze, gestures, and speech. First, a user may request an item identification and description by looking or tapping on an object; a label will appear next to the targeted object. Second, a user can easily localize an item by either selecting it from a list or using a voice command; the corresponding object will be highlighted in the AR view (Fig. 15 (a) and (b)). The second application concerns the control of selected systems of HouseZero through an AR interface. More specifically, the windows in the \u2018Live Lab\u2019 area can be controlled. The headset application implements an HTTP client that communicates with the HRCS server to receive the real-time window state (e.g., 50% open) and to request a new window state (e.g., closed) (Fig. 15 (c)). The role of the last application is to visualize the airflows inside the building, which may occur as a result of the windows control. To make this possible, a synchronized digital twin of the \u2018Live Lab\u2019 space is used to compute CFD simulations in real time. Data derived from the simulations are recorded in a database as soon as they are computed. The heatset application obtains the CFD data through the HRCS server using HTTP requests. Finally, the data is visualized as a grid of animated wind velocities colored by temperature, using OpenGL visualizations (Fig. 15 (d)). Most of the previous studies that apply AR to the building sector have been focused on construction [24], construction safety [25], fire safety, and upskilling [26]. This study demonstrates how the IoT architecture developed allows for a unique application of AR, which in turn enhances building operation and facility management. 4 Discussion In addition to the use of IoT to operate and experience buildings better, IoT can also provide the grounds for experimentation with new approaches that utilize data. With the IoT structure built and its systems calibrated for predictable performance, one goal of this IoT architecture is to research the development of a replicable cloud-hosted, open-source, real-time, sensor-based, data-driven heating/cooling/ventilation control system with machine-learning technology. Other goals include further experimentation with new frameworks for energy management and analysis, as well as enhanced data management and visualization. A first step has been taken to use the building\u2019s prototype \u2018Live Lab\u2019 testbed, geothermal heat pump, natural ventilation, and motorized windows (two windows), and possible solar hot water exchange (one zone), under the control of code developed on the HouseZero Research Server HRCS. The code enables algorithmic data-driven control of thermal performance through direct READ- and WRITE- controls to selected HouseZero sensors and actuators. It also enables the retrieval and sharing of selected real-time and historic data sets, including retrieval and sharing through secure internet connection to remote researchers and collaborators. These efforts include: \u2022 BACNet/KNX Gateway, required for interconnect/communications to/from sensors and devices. \u2022 Window Control Server, required for the \u2018black-box\u2019 proprietary algorithm for heating/cooling control. \u2022 BAS-2, required for data transfer, storage, and display. \u2022 HRCS Research Server, used for code/software development and experimentation. \u2022 \u2018Live Lab\u2019 Testbed, with modular design and independent control for heating, cooling, and ventilation. \u2022 New experimental data-driven control system on HRCS server, controlling one zone and all windows in the \u2018Live Lab\u2019. \u2022 Digital twin virtual testbed. These efforts can be combined, leading to the possible development of open-source, data-driven control that can be deployed on all the zones, as well as the full-building control of all heating, cooling, and ventilation. Since the installed motorized windows use the KNX protocol for communications, and many sensors and wiring interconnections use BACNet, the layer of the BACNet-KNX Gateway needs to be kept in place. This calls for replacing the mediation of commercial window operation control and heat-pump operational control with direct calls from the HRCS code to the underlying sensors, pumps, valves, and motor assemblies. The IoT architecture also allows for experimentation with the development of a new framework for energy management and analysis. Automation of such a framework can also be possible, which could lead to optimizing energy consumption. Data visualization and user-building interaction can also be enhanced using this architecture, with the capacity to fuse real and simulated data and information to enhance the occupants\u2019 experience in the building and optimize the building\u2019s performance. 5 Conclusion The building described provides an experimental protype, complex assembly of laboratory features, and energy-efficient and comfortable workspace all in one. This paper discussed the design of the IoT architecture in this building, which includes a communication network, sensor network, and building operations and research network, as well as a hybrid physical and virtual testbed. To deploy experimental control algorithms and commands, a third independent system was developed that allows developers/researchers to acquire real-time and historical data from the research system and deploy data-driven software/algorithms to control spaces securely. A hybrid physical (\u2018Live Lab\u2019) and virtual (digital twin model) testbed were also developed to support algorithm testing and deployment. Early results demonstrated several applications based on the developed IoT architecture. The first application focused on the experimentation of a learning-based model predictive control algorithm for the automatic windows based on the hybrid physical and virtual testbed. The second application demonstrated a data-informed building energy management framework that continuously improved the building operation energy efficiency by taking advantages of data and models. The third application showcased AR-enhanced building operation and facility management for system/equipment inspection, building system control, and real-time indoor environment visualization. These applications illustrated the capabilities and effectiveness of the IoT architecture developed in HouseZero. In addition, this IoT architecture demonstrated the capacity to harness data for better operation and user interaction of buildings. The application of IoT in a naturally ventilated building illustrated the architecture\u2019s utility as an enabler for better control of passive approaches, including thermal mass. Automation and learning-based, data-driven control can potentially provide scalability. The IoT architecture discussed, with the unique coupling of operation and research networks, illustrated how such control can be developed. Researching best algorithms for such control along with sensor characteristics, placement, and minimum numbers required to generate the required data will be needed. The IoT architecture also illustrated its capacity to utilize real data and synthetic data for the goal of optimal building operation and performance.

        "dc:description": "This paper describes the design of an Internet of Things (IoT) architecture that allows customizable data-driven operations and experimentation for an ultra-efficient office/lab building. To develop the data-driven control for future building operations, the building was designed with two systems: one system for \u201coperation\u201d and another \u201cresearch\u201d system to allow data acquisition, management, and separate commanding mechanisms.It includes the communication network, sensor network, building operations, and research network. The building was designed with multiple heating/cooling zones that can be controlled and commanded individually, as well as with a hybrid physical and virtual testbed to support algorithm testing. There are several applications that utilize this IoT architecture. First, an experiment that illustrates the testing and deployment of a data-driven algorithm using the hybrid physical and virtual testbed is described. Second, data-informed building energy management based on the IoT architecture is introduced. Third, augmented reality-based building operations and facility management is also discussed.",
