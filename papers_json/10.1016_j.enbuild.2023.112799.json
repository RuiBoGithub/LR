HVAC energy consumption can be reduced by air-conditioning only the regions which are occupied. Though occupancy-based smart controllers are common in this regard, they are mostly used for physically separated HVAC zones. Only limited studies have explored localized conditioning within HVAC zones. Micro-zonal occupant-centric control (MZOCC) aims at maintaining a target air temperature only in the virtual micro-zones where occupants are present, leaving other regions unconditioned. There is a need to understand the potential of MZOCC in terms of investment and energy savings and develop strategies for improving it. This study addresses these research gaps by exploring MZOCC in a typical Indian open-plan office using an experimentally validated CFD model. Cooling pattern, energy consumption and thermal contours for varying (1) diffuser arrangement, (2) airflow control, and (3) occupancy conditions are explored. The study\u2019s key findings are (1) MZOCC induces substantial energy savings at minimal additional investment; (2) Strategizing diffuser location and airflow control are required to avoid merging of air jets and heavy thermal gradients; (3) Using a low-velocity flow (setback-flow) or maintaining a higher setpoint temperature (setback-temperature) in unoccupied micro-zones improves the efficiency of MZOCC. This study extends the literature on MZOCC by addressing operational challenges in MZOCC. Keywords Thermal zones Micro-zoning Occupant-centric control Transient CFD Cooling energy 1 Introduction Using a uniform set-point temperature across the HVAC zone leads to large amount of energy wastages. Occupant-centric control (OCC) has helped reduce such energy wastage through smart controllers that detect occupancy and condition only occupied HVAC zones [1]. But OCC is mostly limited to physically separated HVAC zones. Another strategy employed is Personalized ventilation (PV), which creates micro-comfort zones around occupants using personal fans or air handling units [2]. The use of PV is however limited due to lack of adaptability, need for high initial investment, intrusion on occupants and draft discomfort. Micro-zonal occupant-centric control (MZOCC) is a strategy that lies between zone-level OCC and PV and aims at independently operating the diffusers within the thermal zone based on occupancy and occupant\u2019s requirements, thereby dividing the thermal zone into virtual micro-comfort zones [3]. While MZOCC improves energy consumption, it also entails several challenges, such as: (1) increase in time taken to cool [3], (2) loss of cool air to adjacent unconditioned micro-zones [3], (3) merging of air jets from adjacent diffusers [3], (4) increased thermal gradients [3] and (5) need to condition unoccupied micro-zones to reach set-point in the occupied micro-zone [4,5]. Hence, addressing these challenges is necessary before delving into implementing MZOCC. At this point, it seems as an imperative that, planning micro-zones of appropriate size and optimizing airflow control is a way forward. For this matter, airflow must be modelled considering micro-level air transport conditions, which are in turn, influenced by the shape and elements of the space where MZOCC is employed. The characteristics of a space also influences investment required for MZOCC. No study to date has quantified investment or energy savings of MZOCC in practical situations. This study wishes to explore strategies for planning micro-zones and airflow control by considering open-plan offices in the Indian context, quantifying investment required and energy saved. Previous studies have established the potential of MZOCC to improve energy efficiency [5], reduce comfort violations [6] and improve air quality [7]. Parameters such as ambient temperature, air supply velocity, location of diffusers etc. influence the time taken to reach setpoint temperature. Also, these parameters need to be controlled so that air jets from adjacent diffusers may not merge or move away from the occupied micro-zone. Smaller distances between the diffusers increases the probability of merging [3]. In addition, when the size of micro-zones are inappropriately planned leading to insufficient airflow, unoccupied micro-zones will also need cooling in order to attain setpoint in occupied micro-zones. This leads to energy wastage. For instance, for a co-working office with 16 micro-zones, 10 unoccupied micro-zones have to be conditioned to reach the set-point temperature in 3 occupied micro-zones [4]. Further, discomfort due to thermal gradients and draft are observed within and among micro-zones [3]. These can be addressed by maintaining a higher set-point temperature in unoccupied zones and controlling supply air velocity, respectively. Thus, appropriate planning of micro-zonal divisions, location of diffusers and airflow control is asserted to improve MZOCC and accordingly explored in this study. Most previous studies have used theoretical transient models [8,9] or steady-state CFD models [5,10] to predict inter-micro-zonal interaction. Transient analysis of inter micro-zonal interaction using experimentally validated models require a reliable understanding of air jet behaviours and interactions. The size of the zone, occupancy, furniture type, diffuser type, diffuser location and activities within a zone - all influence airflow behaviour. In this study, a survey is conducted to find these characteristics of Indian open plan offices. Among the several typical layouts that can be generated by combinations of most frequently occurring ranges of these characteristics, one typical layout is considered for further analysis. This typical layout was chosen deliberately as it is similar to one of the offices surveyed earlier and is found to be satisfying the range criteria for all the characteristics discussed above. Accordingly, a transient state CFD model is developed and validated through field experiments conducted in this office. Cooling pattern, energy consumption and investment required for varying cases of diffuser arrangement, airflow controls and occupancy levels are next analysed considering the aforementioned typical layout. The novelty of the study lies in its concept, method, as well as findings. No study has probed into methods of planning virtual boundaries within thermal zones considering functional planning and usage of a space. The effects of air-conditioning virtual zones using single and multiple diffusers are analysed to suggest suitable methods of diffuser allocation. In addition, novel airflow control strategies are proposed and examined. Indoor air flow behaviour is modelled through field experiments in an office that closely resembles most offices in India, thus formulating a reliable method for evaluating HVAC control strategies in the Indian context. The study proposes context-specific best practices by examining the principle behind deflection of air jets and suggests strategies for utilizing this deflection to improve the efficiency of MZOCC. The study extends existing literature by establishing that MZOCC can bring in substantial energy savings with minimum investment. Also, strategies such as using a setback flow and setback temperature in unoccupied micro-zones improves MZOCC by tuning the deflection of jets and reducing thermal gradients. The scope of the study is limited to exploring the potential of MZOCC in Indian open-plan offices. The remaining part of the paper is organised as follows: Section 2 gives a literature review, section 3 details the method, section 4 presents the results, section 5 discusses the implications of the results and section 6 highlights the conclusions of the study. Table 1 lists the abbreviations used in this study. 2 Literature review Improving efficiency of air conditioning systems to maintain comfort at low energy costs has been of great interest for the past several decades [11\u201313]. In this regard, thermal zoning that groups spaces based on heat gains and thermal requirements of a space is critical and is the primary step in HVAC system design [14]. Smart control systems such as Occupant centric control (OCC), Demand Controlled Ventilation (DCV) and Demand Responsive Ventilation (DRV) have been effective in reducing zone level energy wastage [15\u201317]. Despite this, the common practice of considering a room as the most granular thermal zone [18] leads to energy wastage by conditioning the entire volume of large rooms with varying activities, occupancy and usage patterns to a single setpoint temperature. Personalized Ventilation (PV) is useful in reducing the aforementioned energy wastage, but its usage is limited because of discomfort on occupants such as intrusion caused by personal fans, unwanted local cooling and thermal gradients causing different thermal sensations in different parts of the body. Also, since it involves additional systems to bring conditioned air to breathing level, it is not flexible to changing layouts and requires high initial investment. It is estimated that for each set of personalized ventilation (for each occupant), about $1750 needs to be invested [19]. Hence MZOCC system must be flexible and use minimal additional investment to increase the likelihood of being used. The investment required for MZOCC is explored in this study. In full-zone conditioning, the aim is to reach setpoint temperature in all regions, and HVAC system design and load capacity are prioritized over air distribution and diffuser allocation. Hence, in most cases, a typical diffuser arrangement is followed (e.g., a grid layout for ceiling diffusers). Nonetheless, several previous studies have highlighted the influence of diffuser design and location on airflow patterns within a room [20]. As per ASHRAE standards, the throw length of a diffuser depends on the airflow rate, terminal air velocity, and features of the diffuser [21]. Further, air jet trajectories for non-isothermal flows are influenced by thermal buoyancy and the Coanda effect, which is contingent on air jet momentum and the relative location of diffusers [22,23]. Hence, the size of room [20,24], design of diffusers [24] and number of diffusers in the room [20] also influence air jet trajectories. For micro-zonal conditioning, predicting air jet movement is critical in defining the size of micro-zones and planning virtual boundaries. Hence, appropriate placement of diffusers considering the spatial planning of the zone is important. There is also a need to tune diffuser operation such that the throw and spread of air jets caters to the requirements of the micro-zone. These are explored in this study. The occupancy conditions and temporal schedule of activities within a thermal zone influence the OCC strategy to be adopted. A study on MZOCC observed that the rate of cooling in micro-zones is not constant and starts to reduce after a certain cooling period. This reduction was due to the inter-micro-zonal interaction from the adjacent unconditioned micro-zone [3]. Based on this, setting unoccupied micro-zones to the set-back temperature after which the rate of cooling begins dropping can result in faster cooling and improve MZOCC. This also opens several research questions on the operation of set-back conditions \u2013 whether it is required to maintain the set-back temperature in all unoccupied micro-zones, or whether maintaining the set-back temperature in micro-zones near the occupied micro-zone is sufficient? Also, since the presence of adjacent air jets can influence air jet trajectories, it is imperative to explore whether maintaining a set-back flow (low velocity flow in diffusers in unoccupied micro-zones) will be suitable for improving the efficiency of MZOCC. Using set-back temperature and setback flow for MZOCC is new and promising. This study aims at exploring the challenges of MZOCC in Indian open-plan offices and identifying methods of addressing them by understanding the critical factors in this regard. Indian offices are chosen since the total floor area of Indian commercial offices is predicted to increase from 277 million sqm (2017) to 340 million sqm (2027), which will result in a surge in energy consumption from 23 billion units to 34 billion units [25]. Earlier studies in the Indian context have primarily focused on reducing whole building energy consumption by improving building form, choice of materials, equipment used etc. [26], and the potential of micro-zonal conditioning is yet to be explored. To explore MZOCC for the Indian context, typical layouts of Indian open-plan offices are required. Features such as size of the room, occupancy, activity spaces, furniture and diffuser type are important. But, previous studies in Indian offices have only explored macro level building characteristics such as ground coverage, form, material, window to wall ratio etc. Hence, this study performs a survey to collect details on the aforementioned micro-features. Finally, there is a need to accurately model the indoor thermal behavior under MZOCC. Previous studies have used theoretical models [9] or steady-state simulations [10] to compute inter-micro-zonal interaction and energy consumption. Since the cooling pattern and energy consumption are influenced by time-sensitive parameters such as occupancy, heat gained, air movement etc., experimentally validated transient state CFD models are best suited to evaluate thermal conditions. This requires heavy computational time and resources and hence cannot be applied to all existing variations of spatial layout. Hence, though several typical layouts can be developed by combining different features from the survey, a typical layout which is similar to an existing office is used for validating the CFD model. In future, other layouts may also be explored. This typical layout is also used in calculating the additional investment required for MZOCC. Based on the literature review, the objectives of this study can be summarized as (1) to quantify the investment required for MZOCC, (2) to explore suitable methods to locate diffusers and plan micro-zones, and (3) to explore airflow control strategies. The analyses are performed on a typical Indian open plan office using experimentally validated transient state CFD models. 3 Methodology A typical Indian open plan office layout arrived at from a survey of 40 office buildings is used to analyze the cooling pattern, energy consumption and thermal contours under different (1) diffuser layouts, (2) airflow conditions, and (3) occupancy conditions. Prior to the analysis, the CFD model is validated. The investment required for MZOCC is computed by collecting market rates of different components. Energy consumption is computed from volume of air required for cooling, time taken to reach setpoint, ventilation required based on occupancy and return air temperature. This section is divided into 4 subsections where section 3.1 discusses the analysis for developing a typical layout, section 3.2 reports the field experiment and results of CFD validation, section 3.3 explains the method of evaluating cooling pattern, energy consumption and thermal contours, section 3.4 discusses the simulation cases and section 3.5 reports the assumptions made for estimating the investment required for MZOCC. 3.1 Data and analysis 3.1.1 Typical Indian open-plan office Open-plan offices in 40 air-conditioned office buildings built in the last decade were surveyed. From these 65 different open-plan office rooms are analyzed in terms of area, aspect ratio, furniture type, activities, diffuser type and occupancy. The size of the open plan office (floor area) and aspect ratio (length/width of the floor plate) are plotted in Fig. 1 . The office buildings are coded from B1 to B40 with codes such as B1.1 depicting the first open-plan office room and B1.2 the second open-plan office room in B1 and so on. The distribution of occupant density (area available per occupant) from 48 office rooms (based on data availability) is shown in Fig. 2 . More than 60 % of these offices have less area (less than 4sqm) available per occupant. This contrasts with previous studies that assume 6\u20138 sqm per person for highly packed Indian offices [26]. Controlling thermal coupling between adjacent micro-zones within such densely packed offices is a challenge that needs to be addressed. On analyzing open-plan offices, five types of activity spaces are majorly observed: (1) workspaces, (2) informal meeting areas or break-out spaces, (3) cafes, (4) formal meeting areas, (5) spaces for machines such as printers or other equipment used by the staff. The percentage of times multiple activity spaces are present in an open plan office is shown in Fig. 3 . Multiple activity spaces are found in 48 % of the open-plan offices, but, most of these offices follow a grid based typical arrangement with uniform flow and zone level control (about 95 % of the offices). As observed in Fig. 4 , about 45 % of offices have square ceiling diffusers, and 26 % have slot diffusers following a typical layout. Since different activity spaces have different occupancy schedule and thermal requirements, planning air distribution systems that allow independent control for each activity space will improve energy efficiency and comfort. Cassette units, which allow independent control of each diffuser, are only present in 4.6 % of the spaces. Hence, improving existing zone level HVAC systems to a micro-zonal controlled system with diffuser level control is important, requires additional investment and needs exploration. For this purpose, a layout with multiple activity spaces will be considered for analysis in this study. Mode is used as the measure of central tendency to find the representative values for each nominal feature. For continuous variables such as aspect ratio of floor plates, occupancy and area, the bin method following the Freedman Diaconis rule is used to find the most frequently occurring range, similar to previous studies [27]. The details of the bin calculations are given in the equations below (1) Bin w i d t h w = 2 I Q R ( s ) n 3 (2) Number o f b i n s N = M a x s - M i n ( s ) w (3) I Q R s = I n t e r q u a r t i l e r a n g e (4) n = n u m b e r o f o b s e r v a t i o n s (5) M a x s = M a x i m u m o f s a m p l e s (6) M i n s = M i n u m u m o f s a m p l e s The square ceiling diffuser type is the most frequently occurring (Fig. 4). As furniture type and cluster restricts and alter air movement, typical furniture types are also studied. Most workspaces have rectangular furniture (60 %) (Fig. 5 ). It interesting to note that for several offices\u2019 diffusers are planned even before planning the activity spaces or furniture layout. It is inferred from the bin method that floor areas in the range of 39.6 to 79.2 sqm, occupancy in the range of 22.7 to 34 occupants and aspect ratios in the range of 0.75 to 9 can be taken as representative values [dataset] [28]. The typical layout of open office finally chosen has aspect ratio of 0.87, area of 58.6 sqm, occupancy of 23 occupants, occupant density (area available per occupant) less than 4 and has mixed activities, square ceiling diffusers and rectangular furniture as shown in Fig. 6 . The room for experiment is designed for 30 occupants and is equipped with a zone-level HVAC system with 6 square ceiling diffusers as shown in Fig. 7 . 3.2 Validation of the CFD model The experimental setup to validate airflow through square ceiling diffusers is shown in Fig. 8 . An array of 18 DTH22 temperature sensors and two thermo-anemometers are used. DTH22 sensors have an instrument error of ±0.5 °C [29] and the Testo 405i hotwire thermo-anemometers have an accuracy of ±0.1 m/s. Twelve temperature sensors are mounted at heights 0.6 m, 1.1 m and 1.8 m from the floor on four poles to capture free air temperature at ankle level, breathing level and standing level, respectively, following ASHRAE 55 standard locations for measurement [30]. Thermo-anemometers are placed at 0.2 m from the supply diffusers to capture the temperature and velocity of supply air. Measuring the characteristics of air very close to the supply diffuser is critical in modelling the boundary conditions of the diffuser in the CFD model. The most popular momentum method [31] is used to define boundary conditions. The CFD model is created using the commercial software ANSYS Fluent, and the details of the numerical scheme are given in Table 2 . Values obtained in the simulation are compared with the sensor readings, as shown in Figs. 9\u201311 [28]. The CFD model is observed to have an error of ±0.6 °C for air temperature and ±0.05 m/s for velocity, which is negligible compared to the measuring error. Hence, the model is validated and can be used for further analysis. This validated CFD numerical scheme is then adopted to the typical layout shown in Fig. 6. A grid-independent tetrahedral mesh of 126,311 cells with minimum orthogonal quality of 0.2 is used for the typical layout. The heat emitted from internal sources such as occupants, computers and lighting within the space are considered as per Table 2. 3.3 Method to evaluate cooling pattern, energy consumption and thermal contours The cooling pattern in each micro-zone is evaluated by observing the rate of cooling at a point within the micro-zone. Total energy consumed for a particular period of HVAC operation is computed using equation (7), where the energy consumed to reach set-point temperature and energy required to maintain set-point temperature are computed separately and added. This is required, as conventional inverter based air conditioning systems operate at a very high power during the initial cool down phase and switches to a low power mode on reaching the setpoint temperature [3]. The power consumed by the HVAC system till it reaches setpoint temperature ( E coolingdown ) is computed using equation (8) as the sum of the power consumed for cooling air ( E cooling ) and power consumed for blowing air using fans ( E fan ). It assumed that one fan is present in the air handling unit (AHU). For calculating cooling power ( E cooling ), the volumetric flow rate Q is obtained from the simulation set-up discussed in section 3.4. The air to be cooled consists of return air mixed with fresh outdoor air as per ventilation requirements computed using equation (12) following ASHRAE 62.1 [34], where A zone is the area of occupied micro-zones and P is the number of occupants. For E cooling , the air temperatures taken from the CFD results (assuming 50 % relative humidity) is used to calculate the enthalpy values of supply ( h s ) and mixed air ( h r ) using the psychometric chart. The fan power ( E fan ) is calculated for one fan using equation (11), where, specific weight of air ( γ ) at a supply air temperature of 13 °C is taken as 2.09 N/m3. Total fan pressure and the efficiency of fan is assumed as 750 pa and 70 % respectively, following existing literature [35]. On reaching set-point temperature in the micro-zone, equation (13) is used to calculate the mass flow rate required to maintain set-point temperature, where, the specific heat of moist air C pm is taken as 1.0216 kJ/kg dry air. K. The volumetric flow required while maintaining cooling ( Q m ) is calculated by dividing the mass flow rate m s by the density of air (assumed as 1.225 kg/m3). The power required for maintaining cooling ( E maintenance ) is calculated similar to cooling power using equations (9) to (12). Finally, the total energy consumed for MZOCC is calculated using equation (7), by inputting the time taken to reach set-point temperature ( T cooldown ) from CFD observations. (7) E Total = E coolingdown ∗ T cooldown + E maintenance ∗ T operation - c o o l d o w n (8) E coolingdown = E cooling + E fan ( t i l l s e t p o i n t i s a c h i e v e d ) (9) E maintenance = E cooling + E fan ( o n a c h i e v i n g s e t p o i n t ) (10) E cooling = Q ∗ h r - h s (11) E fan = γ Q ∗ Δ p 3600 ∗ 1000 ∗ η (12) Q outdoor = R p ∗ P + T a ∗ A zone (13) m s = ( Q sr C pm t i - t s ) Where, E Total Total energy consumed (kWh) E coolingdown Power for cooling (kW) T cooldown Cooling time (s) E maintenance Power for maintaining setpoint (kW) T operation Duration for which AC is operated (s) E Power consumed at an instance (kW) E cooling Power consumed for cooling (kW) E fan Power consumed by the fan (kW) Q Volumetric flow rate (m3/s) γ Specific weight of air (N/ m3), assumed as 2.09 N/m3 for 13 °C h r Enthalpy of unconditioned air (kJ/kg) h s Enthalpy of supply air (kJ/kg) Δ p Total fan pressure (Pa), assumed to be 750 Pa η Efficiency of the fan (%), assumed to be 70 % R p Volume flow required per person (CFM) Q Outdoor Fresh air required P Number of people T a Ventilation to remove toxic gases (per sqm) A zone Area of the occupied micro-zones (m2) m s Mass flow rate (kg/s) Q sr Heat generated in the micro-zone (W) C pm Specific heat of moist air, assumed as 1.0216 kJ/kg dry air.

Animations are generated from the thermal contours for performing transient analysis of air jet behavior to understand the principle behind the deflection of jets [dataset] [36]. 3.4 Simulation cases The various cases of diffuser arrangements, airflow conditions and occupancy considered for analysis are tabulated in Table 3 . D1 refers to the case with a typical diffuser arrangement following a grid layout. D2 corresponds to the case where diffusers are rearranged considering functional planning and activity spaces. As per D1 and D2 there are four micro-zones within the open plan, as shown in Fig. 12 a, b, d, e. MZ3 is a mini-meeting area which is not often used. In D1, MZ4 is larger than other micro-zones and caters to 10 occupants. In D3, additional diffusers are added considering the spatial layout of the zone to allow granular micro-zonal control. Based on the typical spread of square ceiling diffusers [37], a micro-zone of approximately 3mx3m is assumed to be the finest. In D3, considering such a granular virtual division ensures that each MZ caters to a maximum of 5 occupants (Fig. 12 c, f). For each of these cases of diffuser arrangement, airflow variations ranging from A1 to A4 and occupancy conditions ranging from O1 to O3 are considered in the simulations as shown in Table 3. In airflow strategy A1, the entire thermal zone is conditioned, and in A2, only the occupied micro-zones are conditioned. A3 explores a novel OCC strategy of using a low supply velocity (set-back flow) in the unoccupied micro-zones. Two variations of this are explored (a) where a set-back flow is provided only in the micro-zone closest to the occupied micro-zone; (b) where set-back flow is provided in all unoccupied micro-zones. Airflow strategy A4 looks at maintaining a higher temperature (set-back temperature) within unoccupied micro-zones. Such set-back conditions are commonly used in zone level OCC to reach the setpoint quickly for cases of short durations of inoccupancies [17]. For MZOCC, reduced ambient temperature can influence the air jet trajectory and lower cooling time, as the spread of jets is directly proportional to the temperature difference between supply and indoor air [23]. Hence, use of set-back temperature is explored as A4 strategy. Similar to A3, A4 also has two subparts, corresponding to maintaining set-back temperature only in the micro-zone nearest to the occupied micro-zone and maintaining set-back temperature in all micro-zones. The setpoint temperature is set as 23 °C for occupied micro-zone. For A3, a set-back flow of 0.2 m/s is used; for A4, a set-back temperature of 26 °C is considered. Three cases of occupancy conditions, i.e., O1: when the space is fully occupied, i.e., all 20 occupants are present (100 % occupancy); O2: When only ten occupants are present (50 % occupancy) and occupy only one portion of the zone as highlighted in Fig. 12 a, b, c and O3: when five occupants are present (25 % occupancy) and occupy-one micro-zone (MZ1 in Fig. 12 d, e &MZ5 in Fig. 12 f) are analyzed. It is to be noted from Fig. 12 d,e,f that, for case D3, it is assumed that five occupants are present in MZ5, whereas in case of D1 and D2, the occupants are in MZ1. This assumption is made since only four micro-zones are present in D1 and D2, and conditioning for five occupants in MZ4 will still consume the air conditioning required for ten occupants as the micro-zone is not granular to cater to only five occupants. Thus, D3 can cater 5 occupants (O3 conditions) irrespective of the micro-zone in which the occupancy is concentrated, whereas for D2, O3 occupants must be located in either MZ1 or MZ2 for effective MZOCC. Also, in D3 two diffusers are operated to air-condition 10 occupants, where as in D2, only one diffuser is used. Hence the use of multiple diffusers within the same virtual boundary is also explored. Such concentration of occupants in one part of the office is relevant where occupants working on related aspects or belonging to the same work groups or departments are spatially grouped. To summarize, 54 scenarios are analyzed, ranging from D1A1O1 (typical diffuser arrangement with full-zone conditioning and full occupancy) to D3A4bO3 (layout with more diffusers, setback temperature and 25 % occupancy. 3.5 Cost calculations The cost of implementing the aforementioned diffuser arrangement cases is computed by collecting market prices of the various equipment, including labor rates, considering supply, installation and maintenance. A 42 HP VRF system with 4.5 TR Variable Refrigerant Volume (VRV) ceiling-suspended indoor duct-able unit with 1625 CFM is assumed to be used considering thermal requirements of the typical layout. For air distribution, commonly used, factory-fabricated 22G GSS sheet metal with an acoustic lining of 10 mm is considered for the ducts. For air supply, powder-coated aluminum extruded 4-way multi-cone diffusers with aluminum volume control dampers are considered. For MZOCC, galvanized iron (GI) motorized dampers linked with occupancy detection and thermostat controls are also considered. The occupancy detection system is assumed to use a passive infrared (PIR) motion detection module. 4 Results 4.1 Investment required The investment required in upgrading an existing air distribution system to facilitate MZOCC includes employing motorized volume control dampers (VCD) at each diffuser linked with an IoT network with occupancy sensors and thermostats connected to VCD for OCC. Rearrangement of diffusers also alters the ducting cost. Considering all these, the investment required for each case of diffuser arrangement is computed [dataset] [28] and tabulated in Annexure A. The increase in investment for the typical Indian open-plan office is estimated as 4.37 % for D2 conditions (Table 4 ). For D3, the system design and the total volumetric flow are the same as in previous cases as the cooling load of the zone remains unchanged, and only the air flow rate from individual diffusers needs to be altered. Hence additions are majorly in terms of installing new diffusers and ducting, and only about 1 % additional investment is required for the same compared to the rearranged diffuser layout. 4.2 Cooling pattern, energy savings and thermal contours For all the scenarios, the time taken to reach the setpoint, the thermal contours, energy required to reach set point and energy required for maintaining setpoint are analyzed as discussed in section 3.3 and the results are reported in this section. The cooling pattern at point A (point A shown in Appendix B) within the occupied micro-zone under the various simulation scenarios are shown in Figs. 13\u201315 [dataset] [28]. The circles in Figs. 13\u201315 indicate the time point when the setpoint has been achieved. Though it is observed that the time to reach setpoint is the lowest when the entire zone is conditioned irrespective of occupancy, the airflow control strategies explored here help in addressing the increase in cooling time on account of MZOCC. The time taken to reach the setpoint decreases for airflow strategies A3 (set-back flow) and A4 (set-back temperature) compared to A2 (conditioning only the occupied micro-zone). Along with reducing cooling time, A3 and A4 also aid in reducing thermal gradients within the occupied micro-zone as well as between micro-zones. This can be observed in the thermal contours as shown in Appendix B. Partial conditioning of the unoccupied region in A3 and A4 strategies reduces the temperature difference and thermal buoyancy between adjacent micro-zones. As discussed in section 2, the balance between thermal buoyancy and Coanda effect is affected by airflow strategy and location of diffusers, which in turn alters the air jet trajectories [23]. This alteration in air jet trajectories that reduces cooling time and makes A3 and A4 more suited for MZOCC is discussed briefly in the succeeding paragraphs. For A1 cases, the Coanda effect is prominent since all the diffusers are operated simultaneously. The air jets spread, entrain immediate room air and escape through the nearest return diffuser. Due to this, the ceiling is much cooler than the occupied region (thermal contours are shown in Appendix B). In some cases, this even leads to over-conditioning in the corner micro-zones as wall surfaces increase the Coanda effect. For instance, in case of D3A1O1, there is over-conditioning in MZ3 (meeting area) which is often unoccupied (refer to Appendix B). Using demand-controlled ventilation (DCV) or a set-back flow in MZ3 are possible solutions to avoid this. In case of A2 strategies, as the jets spread out from a single diffuser, a low-pressure region is created directly below the diffuser due to thermal buoyancy. The cool incoming air entrains ambient air below the diffusers, so air jets tend to converge after a few minutes of conditioning, as shown in Fig. 16 a. This leads to a strong temperature difference between a concentrated region below the diffuser and the surrounding regions, causing discomfort due to thermal gradients in the occupied micro-zone. Placing return diffusers closer to the supply diffuser or increasing the mass flow rate of supply air are strategies by which this can be avoided. Such convergence of air jets is eliminated in A3 strategies, where a set-back flow is supplied through adjacent diffusers. The attraction between air jets increases the spread of the jets in the occupied micro-zone. As observed in Fig. 16c, low pressure is developed between the diffusers (in addition to the region below the diffusers). The low momentum jet quickly deflects its path towards the low-pressure region due to its lower inertia. Hence, it is observed that the low-velocity air jet deflects to merge with the high-velocity jet and increases the spread of the high-velocity jet (video v1: D3A2O3). Hence tuning the set-back flow is an effective strategy in deflecting air jets and A3 strategies are capable of conditioning the entire micro-zone without heavy thermal gradients. In A4, though the spread of jets initially increases as all diffusers are simultaneously operated, on reaching the set-back temperature, diffusers in unoccupied micro-zones are turned off and air jet in the occupied micro-zone behaves similar to A2 and the spread of the air jet reduces, however the process is much slower compared to A2 due to less temperature variations between adjacent micro-zones. As observed in Fig. 16 d, due to the reduced temperature difference between the supply and ambient air, the air jets are more spread and do not converge like A2 to create concentrated cool regions. When the adjacent diffusers are again switched on to maintain the set-back temperature, the spread of jets in the occupied MZ is again increased. This periodic increase and decrease of spread of jets do not visibly affect thermal comfort within the occupied micro-zone as the changes are gradual and the occupied region is within the setpoint temperature. This also makes A4 a more adaptable strategy to changing occupancy scenarios as it can quickly cool as per the requirement of the zone. Despite the aforementioned advantages of A3 and A4, convergence of jets is observed in scenarios such as D1A3bO2 (video V2: D1A3bO2), D1A4aO3 (video V3: D1A4aO3), D2A4aO3 (video V4: D2A4aO3). Increased airflow is required in such cases to increase the momentum of jets and increase entrainment of ambient air and to reduce convergence. In addition, spatial elements such as furniture, walls, etc., increase the Coanda effect, restricts entrainment [23] and is prominent in scenarios with corner micro-zones such as D3A2O2 (video V5: D3A2O2), where, instead of converging, the jets get attached to the adjacent walls. This attachment leaves the occupied region under-conditioned and must be avoided. In scenarios such as D3A4aO3 (video V6: D3A4aO3), and D3A4bO3 (video V7: D3A4bO3), though the jets initially spread due to the presence of set-back temperature, with time, jets get attached to the adjacent walls. This is because of less distance between the wall and diffusers (Fig. 16 b). Such attachment is expected in most cases, including A1 and A2 if the diffusers are placed very close to the walls. In such cases, A3 strategies are more suitable compared to A4, as the low velocity air jets in A3 provide a continuous attraction to the main jet which can prevent its attachment to the wall. Hence, it is noteworthy that the best airflow strategy varies between A3 and A4 for different diffuser setups and occupancy scenarios. Within A3, it is observed that A3a performs better than A3b as the attraction is mostly from adjacent air jets and operating all diffusers does not improve energy savings. In cases such as D2A3bO2, unwanted merging even increases energy consumption. Between A4a and A4b, A4b is preferred as it reduces the temperature difference between the occupied MZ and all unoccupied MZs, thereby reducing the escape of cool air to uncooled MZs. This is because, as temperature differences reduce, the convective heat transfer and cooling loss due to inter-micro-zonal heat exchange also reduce. The supremacy of A3a and A4b is further evident from the results on energy consumption reported in Appendix C. For D1O2, as the diffusers are planned independent of the furniture arrangement, D1A3aO2 is found to consume the least total energy when operated for one hour, as the air jets are deflected to the occupied region by set-back flow. However, it takes 18 min to reach setpoint temperature and hence, is unsuitable for situations requiring quick cooling. A3b consumes the second lowest energy, but high thermal gradients are observed within the zone due to the unwanted merging of jets because of the low pressure created between the jets and is hence not advisable. Finally, A4b, with the next least energy consumption is found to be the best strategy in terms of cooling time, energy consumption and thermal gradients as A4b takes care of the lack of integration between the location of occupants and diffusers of D1 by conditioning the entire volume to a set-back temperature. Nonetheless, for the case with low occupancy (D1O3), due to the compactness of the region to be conditioned, A3a takes less time to reach the setpoint and is hence the best. When diffusers are rearranged (D2O2), A3a and A4b consume the same energy when operated for one hour. However, the former takes more time to cool and has a higher cooling energy consumption but a low maintenance energy due to reduced return air temperature. Fig. 17 shows the relationship between the time taken to reach the setpoint and the return air temperature for all cases. As the time taken to reach the setpoint reduces, the return air temperature increases (Fig. 17). Hence, if the space is to be used for a short period, a strategy with less cooling time and high return air temperature would yield more savings. However, for long hours of operation, an increased return air temperature will limit the savings achieved through MZOCC. Thus, drawing a balance between the return air temperature and the cooling time based on the duration of occupancy is essential. Hence the choice of best strategy for D2O2 will depend on the duration for which the space is to be occupied. When more diffusers are added with only half of the zone occupied (D3O2), A4b consumes the least energy. For quarter occupancy (D3O3), though A4b consumes the least energy, as discussed, due to diffusers being placed very close to the wall, heavy thermal gradients are observed within the occupied micro-zone. Hence, A3a is preferred, but if the occupied micro-zone was located elsewhere or if the diffusers were placed farther from the wall, the best strategy will be different. Thus, it can be stated that along with diffuser arrangement and occupancy, the size and shape of the micro-zone, location of occupancy, furniture, the heat gain in the micro-zone and the duration for which the micro-zone is occupied are important in selecting the airflow strategy. In addition to energy consumption, thermal gradients within the micro-zone must also be considered while evaluating MZOCC strategy. From the analysis for typical Indian open plan offices, it is observed that A3a and A4b are better than other strategies, and A2 (conditioning only the occupied micro-zone) is the least preferred strategy. While planning MZOCC for a new layout, an iterative analysis of the strategies considering the aforementioned factors can be used to decide the airflow strategy. It is also observed from Fig. 13, Fig. 14, Fig. 15 that in all airflow cases, except A1 (full zone conditioning) there are fluctuations in temperature after reaching the setpoint for the first time, where temperature oscillates near the setpoint for some time before beginning to reduce. This is due to the inter-micro-zonal interaction from the adjacent unconditioned micro-zones. This highlights the need to maintain a buffer time in thermostats to ensure high power cooling during the oscillation period so that the temperature drops below the setpoint. Otherwise, the temperature may increase due to thermal coupling from adjacent micro-zones. On analyzing energy consumed, it is observed that MZOCC improves energy efficiency. For partial occupancies (up to 50 % occupancy) with full zone conditioning (A1) as the base case, when the space is conditioned for an hour using improved airflow control (A2, A3 and A4), about 60 % of HVAC energy can be saved within all diffuser arrangements, i.e., 59.7 % in D1 cases (scenario D1A4aO2), 57.10 % for D2 cases (scenario D2A4aO2) and 60.13 % for D3 cases (scenario D3A4aO2) [dataset] [28] (Appendix C). These savings further increase with improvement in diffuser arrangement, i.e., for each airflow strategy, compared to the typical diffuser arrangement (D1), by rearranging the diffusers (D2), for 50 % occupancy (O2) 9.8 % energy is reduced (scenario D2A4bO2) and for 25 % occupancy (O3), 53.7 % energy is reduced (scenario D2A3bO3). Details are presented Appendix C. For D2, it is also observed that scenarios such as D2A2O2, D2A2O3, D2A4aO3 increases the energy consumption and must be avoided. This increase is due to the aforementioned convergence and attachment of air jets to walls. Similarly, for cases where additional diffusers are added (D3), for O2 (50 % occupancy), 10.8 % of energy reductions are observed in scenario D3A4bO2 and for O3 (25 % occupancy), 42.5 % reduction in D3A4bO3 are observed and energy consumption increases for D3A3aO2 and D3A2O3. Thus, compared to typical full zone conditioning (scenario D1A1O1), about 60 % to 80 % energy is saved by improving diffuser location and planning airflow control. Though it may be felt that the energy reductions for cases of 25 % occupancy (O3) for D3 (i.e., when more diffusers are added (D3O3)) is less than D2 (i.e., when the diffusers are rearranged (D2O3)), as discussed in section 3.4, D3 is more granular than D2. Hence in D3, O3 occupancy is concentrated in MZ5, whereas considering the same location for O3 for D2 will increase energy consumption by 41 %. Similarly, for O2 cases, compared to conditioning MZ4 in D2, conditioning MZ4 and MZ5 in D3 leads to 3 % additional energy savings. This is because conditioning using a single diffuser increases the cooling time in the former, whereas in the latter, air jets from the two diffusers merge and increase the spread of air jets and consume less cooling time and energy. 5 Discussion Micro-zonal OCC can reduce energy consumption and requires only minimal additional investment compared to the overall investment in HVAC systems. In developing countries like India, high investment needs limit explorations of advanced systems for energy efficiency. Hence, compared to other methods of localized conditioning such as personalized ventilation, MZOCC has a higher chance of being used in upcoming open-plan offices for reducing energy wastage in large thermal zones. From the analysis of cooling pattern and energy consumption for various scenarios it is observed that choosing appropriate OCC strategies for MZOCC is important and must be done considering factors such as the size and shape of micro-zone, location of micro-zone, furniture, heat load and duration of occupancy. For the typical Indian open-plan office considered, two strategies \u2013 (1) using a set-back flow in unoccupied micro-zones closest to the occupied MZ and (2) using a set-back temperature in all unoccupied micro-zones, are observed to improve the efficiency of MZOCC and reduce thermal gradients within the micro-zone. Using a set-back flow helps increase the spread of jets and can prevent convergence or attachment of air jets to walls. On the other hand, using a set-back temperature aids in reducing temperature differences across micro-zones and reduces loss of cooling to unconditioned micro-zones. While designing MZOCC for different building typologies, it is imperative to optimize the airflow strategy considering the above-stated factors. The iterations can start with the two best strategies identified here and move to other strategies based on the requirement. Planning micro-zones and locating HVAC diffusers are critical before choosing the airflow strategy. Integrating functional planning with the planning of HVAC sub-zones can be beneficial. For this matter, considerations such as the minimum relative distance between diffusers and the distance between diffusers and walls are important as they influence the merging of jets and attachment of jets to the wall. Choice of the optimal size and shape of micro-zones can also be done iteratively by modifying the diffuser layout and looking for the layout with least energy consumption and thermal gradients considering typical occupancy conditions. This aids in a better starting point from where energy efficiency of MZOCC can be further improved through appropriate airflow control strategies. Dynamic location of occupants, duration of occupancy and heat gained are independent variables that influence the decision on the optimal airflow strategy. Hence, it is inferred that diffuser arrangement and airflow strategies can be considered as decision variables and factors such as occupant location, duration of occupancy, distance from walls, heat gained and furniture in the micro-zone and thermal gradients act as constraints in optimizing energy consumption in MZOCC. Thus, observations from this study provide vital contributions toward developing an optimization framework for MZOCC. In addition, observations from transient inter-micro-zonal interactions highlight the need for setting a buffer time within thermostats so that the setpoint within the occupied MZ stabilizes and starts reducing before the HVAC system switches to a low power mode. Thus, the study addresses the important practical challenges in planning MZOCC and implementing the same in Indian open-plan offices. 6 Conclusions and future directives Though micro-zonal occupancy-centric control (MZOCC) has emerged as a significant method in reducing energy wastage in large thermal zones, several challenges must be addressed before MZOCC can be implemented. In this regard, there is a need to comprehensively analyze the potential of MZOCC and suggest strategies for addressing the challenges. This study explores several operational challenges of MZOCC by examining thermal conditions in a typical Indian open plan office on employing MZOCC. The study uses experimentally validated transient state CFD models and suggests methods of locating diffusers and controlling airflow to improve the efficiency of MZOCC. The study also quantifies the investment required and energy saved using MZOCC. For developing countries such as India, quantitively justifying the need for MZOCC is critical for initiating the development of such smart systems. Due to lack of information on the detailed characteristics of Indian open-plan offices, a survey is conducted to determine the frequently used furniture, diffuser type and ranges for aspect ratio, occupancy and area of offices. Field study is conducted in an office similar to a typical office satisfying the range criteria for all the characteristics, and temperature and airflow data collected is used to validate the numerical scheme for CFD model for this typical layout. On validating, this model is used for analyzing the cooling pattern, energy consumption and thermal contours under varying scenarios of diffuser arrangement, airflow strategies and occupancy conditions. Results indicate that at least 60 % of energy can be saved under partial occupancy with just 4 %\u20135% additional investment. Planning optimal micro-zones and using appropriate airflow strategies can further improve energy efficiency. Micro-zonal planning and diffuser allocation can be optimized by considering functional requirements and typical occupancy conditions. Airflow strategies can then be optimized during each operation by considering dynamic occupant location, predicted duration of occupancy and heat gain. The study establishes the use of set-back flow and set-back temperature as strategic methods to improve MZOCC and also gives an outline for developing an optimization framework to select appropriate airflow strategies. Some limitations are that only a typical layout with fixed-size square ceiling diffusers is considered for analysis. Exploring strategies for multiple layouts and diffuser types considering the factors inferred from this study will give further clarity on improving MZOCC and can be explored in future studies. Similarly, variations in comfort setpoint, set-back temperature and set-back flow velocity are not explored, and external heat gain is not considered. Dynamic selection of these parameters based on heat gain and thermal comfort can further improve MZOCC. Moreover, there is a need to quantitively analyze the thermal comfort of the occupants under MZOCC and may be explored in the future. Though it is observed that the additional investment for MZOCC is minimal, there is also a need to probe into technical challenges faced during implementation. Thus, by exploring the practical implications of employing MZOCC in Indian open-plan offices, this study opens discussions on future intelligent MZOCC systems in open-plan offices for maximum energy savings. Most significant of all, spatial and operational parameters identified in this study along with the parameters from previous studies can be used in developing a framework for systematic analysis and decisions on best MZOCC strategy for a given space.

        "dc:description": "HVAC energy consumption can be reduced by air-conditioning only the regions which are occupied. Though occupancy-based smart controllers are common in this regard, they are mostly used for physically separated HVAC zones. Only limited studies have explored localized conditioning within HVAC zones. Micro-zonal occupant-centric control (MZOCC) aims at maintaining a target air temperature only in the virtual micro-zones where occupants are present, leaving other regions unconditioned. There is a need to understand the potential of MZOCC in terms of investment and energy savings and develop strategies for improving it. This study addresses these research gaps by exploring MZOCC in a typical Indian open-plan office using an experimentally validated CFD model. Cooling pattern, energy consumption and thermal contours for varying (1) diffuser arrangement, (2) airflow control, and (3) occupancy conditions are explored. The study\u2019s key findings are (1) MZOCC induces substantial energy savings at minimal additional investment; (2) Strategizing diffuser location and airflow control are required to avoid merging of air jets and heavy thermal gradients; (3) Using a low-velocity flow (setback-flow) or maintaining a higher setpoint temperature (setback-temperature) in unoccupied micro-zones improves the efficiency of MZOCC. This study extends the literature on MZOCC by addressing operational challenges in MZOCC.",
