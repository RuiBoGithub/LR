Table 6 Demand response type Category Definition Price based Time of use (TOU) According to the load situation of the power system, the day is divided into peak, flat, and valley periods, and different tariffs are set for each period according to the different operating costs of the system, which can stimulate consumers to take actions such as shifting the peaks, filling valleys, and adjusting the power consumption patterns. Real-time price (RTP) A dynamic tariff mechanism with hourly or even shorter periods correlates the retail tariff with the outgoing electricity price in the wholesale electricity market and accurately communicates the tariff information for each tariff cycle. Critical peak pricing This tariff mechanism superimposes the peak rate on the TOU tariff. The TOU tariff is used in the non-peak period, and peak rate is used in the peak period. Users can adjust the electricity consumption mode accordingly. Incentive based Direct load control (DLC) DLC aims to achieve customer load reduction when the peak load of the grid relies on the control of the remote response terminals by the implementing agency. The DLC involves short outages of the load, which do not significantly affect the customer; the advance notice time is mostly at the minute level. Interruptible load Based on the prediction of the grid operation peaks, the grid sends interruption response instructions to the customers in advance, and the customers take an appropriate decision regarding the load reduction plan. Demand bidding In this mechanism, customers can directly participate in the electricity market competition. Competitive bidding is mainly in the form of customers proposing the amount of load that can be cut at a certain compensation price or customers proposing the corresponding amount of load cut according to the compensation price specified by the grid. Emergency demand response programs (EDRP) In case of emergency failure or serious shortage of power supply in the power system, an emergency response command will be sent to the EDRP users to require them to complete the response task in a short time.

The problems of continuous rise in global power consumption, gradual increase in the peak\u2013valley difference of power systems, and continuous expansion of renewable energy penetration have caused the power system regulation to shift from the traditional supply side to demand side. Buildings have huge power consumption and great energy flexibility, making them one of the most important units on the demand side of a power system. This study performed a detailed review of 183 literatures on flexible energy resources. The review has been carried out from the supply and demand side and demand response strategy side. Based on the results of the analysis and discussion, we proposed seven general quantitative models of flexibility for commonly used flexible resources, which lays the foundation for the flexibility evaluation of the building electric energy flexible system (BEEFS) and implementation of demand response strategies. In addition, the optimization techniques commonly used in demand response strategies are analyzed to achieve different goals. The results show that the combination of these strategies and optimization techniques can achieve the goals of reducing operating costs (OCs) by 4%\u201342%, reducing peak power (PP) by 15%\u201396%, and improving renewable energy consumption rate (RECR) by 6%\u201370%. This study constructs an overall framework for the flexibility quantification of building electric energy systems, which can be further expanded in the future. In the process of interaction between the building and the grid, appropriate demand response strategies and optimization techniques need to be selected according to the types and characteristics of flexible resources to achieve the goals in the demand response process.

At the same time, the peak\u2013valley difference of the power system has increased, and the contradiction between supply and demand has further deepened [1]. The number of peak hours during the operation of a power grid over a year is very small [2], resulting in power plants being predominantly in the idle state. However, the previous power system maintenance and reinforcement technology required the installed capacity of the power system to be continuously increased to meet the peak demand of these few peak hours of operation, resulting in increasing the cost in power grid construction and transformation year by year, and increasing loss of the transmission and distribution network [3]. In addition, the rise in energy consumption has resulted in serious environmental pollution. To solve this problem, the power energy system has been connected with numerous renewable energy generation sources, thus actively implementing energy conservation and emission reduction to achieve a low-carbon economy. According to the long-term technology roadmap of the International Energy Agency, renewable energy generation is expected to account for at least 31% of the global power production by 2050 [4,5]. However, renewable energy generation is intermittent, volatile, and unpredictable, which further causes a gap between electricity demand and power grid supply [6]. Therefore, it is urgent to find a solution to address this gap in the power system. This can be achieved through two methods. The first method is to start from the source side of the power system and build power plants, including renewable energy sources (RESs), according to the demand side of the power system [7,8]. The disadvantages of this method have been stated above. The second method is to start from the demand side of the grid system, integrate the flexible resources on the demand side, and use demand response and energy management technology to adjust the power load mode on the demand side [9\u201311]. This method can not only solve the problem of increasing peak load, but also improve the consumption rate of renewable energy and promote the transformation of the power system toward green and low-carbon operation. 1.2 Building electric energy flexible system As one of the largest components on the demand side of the power system, building electricity consumption accounts for more than 39% of the total electricity consumption in China and more than 70% in the United States [12,13]. Thus, it has great potential for flexible regulation of electricity energy. There are various definitions of power system flexibility. Hsieh et al. [14] clarified that flexibility is the ability of a power system to maintain a balance between power generation and load uncertainty. Petersen et al. [15] presented a more generic definition of flexibility, that is, the ability to deviate from the reference power load profile. Although the definitions focused on different aspects, the common concern was the ability to maintain power system stability under uncertainty. With continuous expansion of the scope of power system flexibility, the flexibility of a BEEFS has been defined by several researchers. Table 1 summarizes the typical definitions of BEEFS. In general, the flexibility of a building electric energy system is the ability to meet the different needs of the grid by relying on various flexible resources of the building under the condition of allowing the normal functions of the building and ensuring the comfort of occupants. The BEEFS contains many flexible resources, which can be divided into supply-side flexible resources and demand-side flexible resources according to the supply-demand relationship with the building and grid. Renewable energy generation equipment and electric energy storage devices are the flexible resources on the supply side of the BEEFS, which can not only provide power to the building, but also directly perform one-way or two-way interaction with the grid [16,17]. The above classification is relative to the building. Relative to the power grid, demand-side flexible resources include shiftable load and shedable load. Demand-side flexible resources respond to the demand of the grid according to their shiftable and shedable characteristics [18,19]. The schematic of BEEFS constructed in this study is shown in Fig. 1 . In terms of supply-side flexible resources, Peng et al. [20,21] summarized the renewable energy generation technologies (for example, solar photovoltaic and wind turbine) that are widely used for supplying power to buildings, thus providing theoretical support for the renewable energy generation technologies applied to buildings. Tang et al. [12] elaborated the flexibility of renewable energy in building load coverage, but the flexibility was not quantified. In recent years, stationary batteries and electric vehicles (EVs) have attracted much attention as important flexible resources. According to the power supply, stationary batteries and EVs discharge power to the building during the peak hours of electricity consumption, and are charged during the non-peak period [22]. In addition, the charging and discharging technologies of stationary batteries and EVs can be jointly optimized with renewable energy generation technologies to increase the consumption rate of renewable energy and improve the flexibility of building electric energy systems [23]. Aiming at energy systems that included renewable energy and EVs, Yoon et al. [24,25] established the charging and discharging model of EVs to reduce the operating cost and increase the consumption rate of renewable energy. The contribution of supply-side flexible resources to building energy flexible systems has been demonstrated, yet there is still a lack of research on their generic flexible quantitative model, which affects their wide application in building demand response strategies. Similar conclusions can also be found in these studies [26\u201328]. Regarding demand-side flexible resources, the flexible potential of air conditioning systems [29], lighting systems [30] washing machines [31], dishwashers [32], and electric water heaters [33] has been studied by many scholars. As a flexible resource, building thermal mass cannot be used alone, and is often combined with air conditioning systems. Building users can use the cooling and heat storage capacity of the building thermal mass to turn on the air conditioning system to pre-cool or pre-heat the rooms in advance, thus shifting the cooling or heating load from peak to off-peak hours to reduce energy costs [34]. The quantification of building flexible resources is the basis of building demand response. Many studies have developed quantified models of flexible resources for specific energy systems or scenarios. For HVAC systems, Nuytten et al. [35] proposed a flexibility assessment model for thermoelectric systems with thermal energy storage systems and proposed a flexibility curve to quantify the energy flexibility of a combination of thermoelectric systems with thermal energy storage boxes. For a power operation system containing energy storage devices, Heussen et al. [36,37] quantified energy flexibility using three metrics: available storage capacity, storage efficiency, and power shift capability. For residential heat pump systems, Zhang et al. [38] developed several metrics related to various stakeholders to quantify building demand flexibility. Wu et al. [39] proposed a modeling, scheduling, and control framework for residential thermostatically controlled loads to provide energy shift, peak load shedding services to the grid. Doulos et al. [40,41] investigated the regulation potential of a system consisting of renewable energy and lighting in buildings in terms of demand response. Zheng et al. [42,43] proposed an optimal scheduling model for a system consisting of a fixed-frequency air conditioner and an EV to achieve integrated control optimization of the combined cost and user satisfaction. Stinner et al. [44] proposed a method to analyze the flexibility of building energy systems in terms of time, power, and energy. In addition, some studies proposed innovative control strategies in building electric energy systems to evaluate the impact of control strategies on system flexibility by analyzing operating costs, CO2 emissions, peak power, and power shift [45]. The results of the above studies show that quantitative models or methods have achieved varying degrees of success in specific energy systems or scenarios. However, it is difficult to promote them to other general energy systems. Meanwhile, some flexible quantitative models rely on initial boundary conditions, which further hinders the application of the models in other energy systems. Therefore, a generalized flexible quantification model is needed for building electric energy systems. On this basis, the potential of flexible resources in different building electric energy systems can be compared or aggregated to better serve the demand response between buildings and power grids. In addition, the demand response strategies for the collaborative matching of the supply-side and demand-side flexible resources in a BEEFS play an important role in achieving various optimization goals. Ghazvini et al. [22] studied the cost of an energy system consisting of a photovoltaic system, an EV, and an electric water heater based on a price-based demand response strategy, and achieved the goal of 29.5%\u201331.5% operating cost savings. In the energy system consisting of a washing machine, EV, and air conditioner, Wei et al. [46,47] used a demand response strategy with time-of-use tariff to balance the economic and comfort requirements of the building. Tang et al. [48] used the demand response strategy of direct load control to shut down the number of parts of the chiller/pump in the air conditioning system, successfully reducing power consumption by 23%. The available literature mainly focuses on the technical effects of the implementation of demand response strategies in the energy system composed of some flexible resources, and focuses less on the classification of the matching situation between flexible resources and demand response strategies and the summary of optimization techniques that promote flexibility enhancement. 1.3 Main contributions of the study In summary, flexible resources in BEEFSs have significant potential for demand response. However, most of the current studies focus on overcoming the technical barriers to improving the flexibility of one or a few flexible resources, and lack of a comprehensive overview of the measures to improve the flexibility of flexible resources [22,46\u201349]. In addition, it is necessary to quantify the flexible resources used to provide demand response. Owing to the wide variety of flexible resources involved in BEEFSs, most studies have proposed a quantitative model for the flexible resources of a specific system or scenario [35\u201345]. However, with increasing participation of buildings and users in the demand response market, there is an urgent need for a general quantitative model to quantify the flexibility potential of different flexible resources. Based on previous research, this paper systematically describes the measures to enhance the flexibility of building electric energy systems from three aspects\u2014supply-side flexible resources, demand-side flexible resources, and demand response strategies\u2014and proposes a generic quantitative model for quantifying the flexibility of the supply-side and demand-side flexible resources in BEEFSs. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the supply-side flexible resources of BEEFSs and proposes a generic flexible quantification model for them. Section 3 introduces the demand-side flexible resources of BEEFSs and proposes a generic flexible quantification model for them. Section 4 details the demand response strategies for collaborative matching of supply-side flexible resources and demand-side flexible resources of BEEFS. Section 5 presents the flexibility evaluation index of BEEFSs and discusses the future research directions. Section 6 presents the conclusions. 2 Supply-side flexible resources for building electric energy flexible systems The supply-side flexible resources involved in the study included three components: renewable energy, stationary batteries, and EVs. Renewable energy generation not only has great benefits for environmental sustainability, but also can improve the flexibility of the building electric energy system. The application of stationary batteries and EVs in buildings substantially improves the flexibility of the building electric energy systems; this aspect has been extensively researched in recent years [53,54]. The three components can be applied in buildings individually and together, and the latter has greater application potential. 2.1 Renewable energy In recent years, significant progress has been made in building renewable energy generation technologies. For example, the cost of solar panels has been decreasing annually and the efficiency of wind turbines has been increasing, which suggests a greater possibility for the popularization of building renewable energy generation technologies [55\u201357]. Photovoltaic panels can be installed on the building envelope (e.g., roof, facade), and wind turbines are typically installed on the building roof [58,59]. The electricity generated by renewable energy can directly meet part of the building load, which not only reduces the power demand from the grid, but also reduces the loss of the transmission and distribution network, such that the building has two attributes of production and consumption. The related flexible model is (1) F l e r e s = ∑ i n ∫ t t + t D R P r e s i ( t ) d t where Fle res is the level of flexibility of the renewable energy, i is the type of renewable energy generation unit, t DR is the time of demand response, and P resi (t) is the power generated by the renewable energy generation unit i. The power generated through renewable energy generation is greatly uncertain owing to the influence of meteorological conditions. For example, photovoltaic power generation is affected by external conditions such as temperature, irradiance, and humidity, and wind power generation is affected by conditions such as wind speed and air density [60,61]. Fig. 2 shows the dynamic relationship between renewable energy generation and building load power. Phase a indicates that the renewable energy generation is in surplus relative to the building load, and the excess power can be delivered to the grid or stored in batteries. Phase b indicates that the renewable energy generation is in shortage relative to the building load, and the municipal power grid or energy storage device is required to supply the building electricity [62]. Owing to the intermittence and uncertainty of renewable energy generation, the flexibility of renewable energy is greatly reduced. The rapid development of electric energy storage systems (ESSs) has solved this problem. ESSs have been integrated into different levels of the modern power system to achieve various economic and environmental benefits [63]. Renewable energy generation systems equipped with battery devices can greatly increase the flexibility of the RESs, and ESSs can be integrated with renewable energy generation systems to jointly respond to grid demands. Luthander et al. [64] showed that the relative self-consumption rate of renewable energy could increase by 13%\u201324% if the photovoltaic boards per kWp were equipped with a 0.5\u20131 kWh capacity battery. The uncertainty of quantitative renewable energy generation is of great importance in the process of combining renewable energy generation with grid and energy storage devices. Ugranlı et al. [65] proposed an opportunity-constrained-distribution grid planning approach that uses probability density models to deal with the long-term uncertainty associated with load, wind, and solar generation. In addition, the Monte Carlo algorithm is commonly used to solve the uncertainty problem in renewable energy generation [66,67]. It is worth noting that the Monte Carlo algorithm requires the statistical analysis of the uncertainty distribution pattern of the meteorological factors. A recent research focus is the sharing of renewable energy power generation among building clusters. When buildings are interconnected, the renewable energy system becomes a decentralized energy network, which can be connected to the neighborhood system, and the remaining energy can be shared among buildings [68,69]. The system model can improve the overall energy flexibility of buildings; moreover, it has major significance for energy conservation and emission reduction of building clusters. 2.2 Electrical energy storage Electric energy storage technology refers to converting electric energy into a storable form and temporarily storing it for future use [70,71]. The types of electric energy storage commonly used in power systems are shown in Table 2 . The application of electrical energy storage technology in buildings has had a profound effect on building demand and building energy flexibility. The electric energy storage device can perform flexible regulation activities such as demand shifting and peak load regulation on various time scales [72]. Among them, stationary batteries and EVs have become the most important power storage devices in buildings owing to the declining cost of stationary batteries and rising popularity of EVs. 2.2.1 Stationary battery On the one hand, the stationary battery energy storage system can solve the problems of randomness and intermittency of a distributed power output [75,76]. On the other hand, it can alter the charging and discharging power according to the real-time changes in the electricity price. During the period of peak electricity price, the stationary battery can be used to supply power to the building, thus reducing the cost of power purchased from the power grid. During the period of low electricity price, the building users can charge the stationary battery, thus making full use of the characteristics of the stationary battery and real-time electricity price [77], reducing the electricity cost of the building, and improving the flexibility of the building electric energy system. The flexible metric model of the stationary battery is shown in Eqs. (2) and (3). (2) F l e b a t / e v = ∫ t t + t D R k ( t ) P b a t / e v ( t ) d t (3) k ( t ) = { 1 b a t t e r y c h a r g i n g − 1 b a t t e r y d i s c h a r g i n g where Fle bat/ev is the level of flexibility of the stationary battery or EV. k(t) is the charge/discharge state of the stationary battery or EV. The value 1 indicates that the stationary battery or EV is charging, whereas −1 indicates that the stationary battery or EV is discharging. P bat/ev (t) is the charge/discharge power of the stationary battery or EV. The installation of stationary batteries in buildings requires attention to the following two aspects. ● Selection of stationary battery size Proper stationary battery size is important to deal with fluctuations in renewable energy and demand for municipal power. Based on the method of evaluating the energy balance between power generation and consumption in a given design cycle, Kichou et al. [78] reported that the deviation between the actual battery size and simulated battery size was less than 5%, which had reference significance for actual projects. Koskela et al. [79,80] studied the scale of the stationary battery as a flexible resource. The scale of the stationary battery for demand response operation depends on the load condition of the building, and individual peaks can be removed when considering the peak load, because these peaks do not recur every day. In addition, the research results of Rosati et al. [71] showed that determining the size of the stationary battery according to the change in renewable energy could yield better economic benefits under all climatic conditions. ● Lifetime of stationary battery The lifetime of a stationary battery is an important factor affecting the application of batteries in buildings [81,82]. The lifetime of a battery needs to be considered when evaluating its benefits as a flexible resource. Zheng et al. [83] established a storage cost model by considering the battery lifetime, and studied the demand response profits provided by different types of batteries. They showed that Ni\u2013Cd batteries were the least profitable whereas pumped storage units were the most profitable. Weitzel et al. [84] introduced a nonlinear optimization model for hybrid integrated local energy supplier management by considering battery aging costs in a real case study, and the final results showed a 74% increase in battery life when compared with the model that did not consider battery aging costs. If the builder does not fully consider the battery aging cost, the decision support model used to operate and design the energy storage system will greatly overestimate the availability of storage, resulting in failure to use it with maximum economic viability. 2.2.2 Electric vehicles As EVs have become progressively larger in recent years, their technology as a flexible resource has gained increasing attention from scholars [85]. Khemakhem et al. [86] defined the concepts of vehicle to building, vehicle to vehicle, and vehicle to grid. Huang et al. [23,85,87] studied the characteristics of EVs as energy storage devices in reducing the peak value of the power grid, increasing the self-consumption rate of renewable energy, and improving the energy flexibility potential of buildings. EVs have similar characteristics as stationary batteries; their flexibility measurement functions are shown in Eqs. (2) and (3). Unlike the stationary battery, the EV is a shiftable electric energy storage device, and its charging and discharging behavior is affected by many travel parameters. Therefore, the scheduling potential of EVs as flexible resources can be better quantified by determining the criteria related to the EV travel parameters. In previous studies on the flexibility of EVs, researchers generally assumed the travel parameter distribution of EVs [88,89], which led to some degree of error in their actual scheduling process. EVs generally travel back and forth between office areas and residential areas. The study conducted field investigation and analysis on 255 EVs from Beijing University of Technology to identify the general rules of the main travel parameters of EVs and provide support for their scheduling analysis as flexible resources. The survey questionnaire is shown in Table 3 . The results show that the main travel parameters of EVs obey the law of normal distribution (μ, σ2). Some of the results are shown in Figs. 3\u20136 . Based on the law, scholars can study the actual charging and discharging power and flexible scheduling strategy of EVs. 3 Demand-side flexible resources of building electric energy flexible systems Demand-side flexible resources involved in the study include the flexible loads and thermal mass of buildings. The flexible load of a building refers to the load that can be adjusted and changed. Li et al. [27] summarized 302 studies, in which the most important types of flexible loads were shiftable loads and shedable loads. In the study, the flexible characteristics of these two load types were reviewed. Building thermal mass is an important flexible resource on the demand side, which can realize load transfer without additional investment and has a minor effect on other building activities [90,91]. 3.1 Flexible loads of building 3.1.1 Shiftable loads Shiftable loads refer to the flexible load with fixed operating power and translatable operating period, which has the characteristics that the power consumption curve can be translated across different periods and power consumption of the load does not change [92], as shown in Fig. 7 . Shiftable loads are mainly used in residential buildings and are an important resource for the residential buildings to respond to the grid demand. The shiftable loads reviewed in this study mainly include electric water heaters, washing machines, and dishwashers. The good thermal storage capacity of electric water heaters makes them suitable for long-term power shift. Electric water heaters are not long-term open loads and require energy for heating only at a specific point in time; thus, their operation has limited effect on users. Regarding the shifting characteristics of electric water heaters, the working interval of the appliance can be shifted by exploiting the low-electricity-price hours to achieve the purpose of saving electricity cost and peak shaving [93,94]. According to the actual situation, Kaspar et al. [95] investigated the delay time that residents can accept for washing machines and dishwashers, and calculated the amount of shift for shiftable loads. Based on the measurement data of 89 households in Austin, Texas, the researchers found that, on average, dishwashers are more flexible than washers and tumble dryers [31]. During the actual scheduling of shiftable loads, residential customers can set a time window t win , during which the shiftable load can be deployed flexibly and the appliance can operate freely. Once started, the appliance with shiftable properties will usually complete all programs continuously. The shift diagram of a shiftable load is shown in Fig. 8 . The working time of the shiftable load is t wh . When t win is equal to t wh , the shiftable time and shiftable power are 0, regardless of whether the demand response time t DR intersects with t win . When t win is greater than t wh but less than 2t wh , if t DR and t win do not intersect, the shiftable time and shiftable power are 0. If t DR and t win intersect, the maximum shiftable time is (t win −t wh ), and the maximum transferable power is p shift multiplied by (t win −t wh ). When t win is greater than or equal to 2t wh , if t DR and twin do not intersect, the shiftable time and shiftable power are 0. If t DR and t win intersect, the maximum shiftable time is t wh , and the maximum transferable power is p shift multiplied by t wh . The flexible metric model of a shiftable load is expressed in Eqs. (4) and (5). (4) F l e s h l = P s h i f t Δ t (5) Δ t = { 0 t w i n = t w h 0 ≤ Δ t ≤ t w i n − t w h t w h < t w i n < 2 t w h 0 ≤ Δ t ≤ t w h 2 t w h ≤ t w i n where Fle shl is the level of flexibility of the shiftable load. P shift is the rated power of the shiftable load. Δt is the shiftable time. t win is the time window set by the user. t wh is the operating time of the shiftable load. 3.1.2 Shedable loads Shedable loads are loads for which the power consumption can be reduced through optimal control strategies, and their power consumption is fixed at certain times of the day [96], as shown in Fig. 9 . Loads with large shedable potential in buildings mainly include air conditioning loads and lighting loads; the power consumption of these loads can be adjusted by adjusting the temperature setting, lighting intensity, etc. The flexibility potential provided by the type of load is influenced by the thermal and visual comfort of users. 3.1.2.1 Air conditioning loads Air conditioning loads can be an important flexible resource in building\u2013grid interactions for several reasons, as follows: 1) Air conditioning systems account for a relatively large share of power consumption in both summer and winter. 2) Air conditioning systems are capable of temporary unloading and preloading in conjunction with the thermal inertia of the physical structure of the building. 3) Air conditioning systems are easily integrated into intelligent energy management systems [97,98]. The air conditioning systems of buildings are mainly divided into split air conditioning and central air conditioning systems; Table 4 summarizes the research results of these two air conditioning systems. The flexible regulation control strategy often used in split and central air conditioning system is mainly divided into three categories: global temperature regulation, air flow, and water flow distribution change. These categories are interrelated and have their own characteristics. Adjusting the global temperature in the occupied area changes the power configuration at the whole building level. This strategy not only reduces the load of all relevant air handling, cooling or heating equipment, but also makes all regions equally share the burden of reducing service levels. This strategy is considered to be the most effective and least objectionable [99], which performs well in reducing peak load and operating costs. Yoon et al. [100,101] proposed a controller that can reduce peak load and save power cost while maintaining reasonable thermal comfort. When the retail price is higher than the customer preset price, the controller changes the set point temperature. The results show that the strategy saves 10.8% of energy costs and reduces 24.7% of peak load. Fitzpatrick et al. [102] noted that typically, real-time pricing is the most favorable tariff structure that provides the greatest energy flexibility at the lowest associated cost of electricity. Olivieri et al. [103] reduced peak load demand by 23\u201347% during demand response using a strategy of synergizing indoor temperature set points with other temperature set points in the air conditioning system. In the research of demand response services, increasing attention has been paid in recent years to the use of CO2 and other indoor environmental factors as indicators of indoor environmental quality and occupant satisfaction. Marotta et al. [104] developed rule-based control algorithms from economic and environmental perspectives to flexibly control the regulation of heating set points to respond to price or emission signals. The results showed that the economic algorithm achieved 21.46% cost savings, while reducing CO2 emissions by 15%. The environmental algorithm reduced CO2 emissions by 30% and cost by 17.58%. Marotta et al. [105] added charge and discharge control of battery energy storage system on the basis of a space heating system to improve the energy flexibility of a building in southern Italy. The main results showed a 10% reduction in operating costs and 79% reduction in CO2 emissions. Péan et al. [45] developed and tested a model prediction controller within the TRNSYS and MATLAB co-simulation framework and studied the role of the controller in energy flexibility in terms of cost, CO2 emissions, and thermal energy. The results showed that the model predictive controller could reduce the operating power of heat pumps, saving 13\u201329% of the operating costs and reducing marginal CO2 emissions by 19\u201329%. It is important to determine the carbon emission signal in adjusting the temperature set point of the air conditioning system to reduce carbon emissions. Péan et al. [106] obtained data on the energy mix in each hour according to the Spanish national context and energy mix. Based on the CO2 emission factor of each energy source, the expression of the marginal emission factor signal was given considering the load difference and the average CO2 emission difference between the data, which laid the foundation for the subsequent flexible regulation of energy sources. In terms of control strategies affecting airflow distribution changes, Blum et al. [107] studied the influence of changing the static pressure setting of the fan to reduce the load of the chiller system with air handle unit through numerical simulation. Reducing the static pressure setting will cause the fan speed to decrease, thereby responding to the demand of the grid. When using this strategy, it is necessary to set reasonable static pressure values to achieve effective demand response [87,108]. In the air conditioning system, the change in air flow distribution often interacts with the chiller. For example, as the temperature of chilled water rises, the system saves cooling energy. Simultaneously, the air supply temperature will increase, and the fan power may rise to increase the air flow to maintain the indoor environment. Therefore, when the above scenarios occur, the control strategy of fans and chillers may need to be modified at the same time to select the appropriate supply water temperature and fan power [69]. Aduda et al. [109] directly controlled fan speed and limited it continuously for 120 min at 60% of the rated ventilation setting, reducing the peak power by 67% without affecting indoor air quality. In addition, rule-based algorithms are often used in control strategies that vary airflow distribution. The regulation of central equipment will affect the distribution of water flow in the system. In the centralized air conditioning system, the power demand of chillers accounts for a large portion of the total power demand and is an important demand response resource. Although shutting down some running chillers will immediately reduce the operating power, it will also cause the imbalance of chilled water distribution in the air conditioning system. To solve this problem, Tang et al. [110] developed a water flow monitor based on adaptive utility function, which is used to update the chilled water flow set point of each area online, to maintain the uniform change of indoor air temperature in all areas during demand response. The test results show that the proposed control strategy can achieve rapid power reduction after receiving demand response requests, and effectively solve the problem of water distribution disorder. In addition, Tang et al. [48,111] studied how to determine the number of chillers/pumps shut down, and how to systematically adjust the load of retained equipment during demand response events. First, after receiving the demand response request, considering the acceptable sacrifice of indoor air temperature, the cooling demand and power limit threshold of the building are predicted. Then, the system sequence control reset scheme is used to determine the reserved quantity of chillers and pumps. Finally, the total chilled water flow delivered to the building is controlled/regulated online to adjust the load of the chiller and ensure that the system power meets the expected configuration. This strategy not only achieves the expected reduced power, but also ensures the acceptable regional temperature. Various regulation strategies of system equipment often affect the distribution of water and air flow. During adjustment, it is necessary to avoid fluid distribution imbalance and power rebound after demand response. Flexible regulation strategies for HVAC systems are the key to the construction of flexible systems for building electric energy. This section is a generalization of the research on flexible regulation of air conditioning systems. Based on the available literature, we summarized the main research ideas on flexible regulation of the two air conditioning systems. Main research ideas for split air conditioning systems. The split air conditioning system is an important flexible resource, and indoor temperature reset is a common control strategy for the system. The schematic of the adjustment process is shown in Fig. 10 . Before implementing the control strategy, the indoor temperature changes periodically in the range of Tmax and Tmin. After implementing the control strategy of the temperature reset, the indoor temperature changes periodically within the range of T'max and T'min. The opening time and closing time of the air conditioning system changes, as does the operating energy consumption. Based on the control strategy of indoor temperature reset, this study summarizes the main research ideas of split air conditioning and proposes a general flexible quantitative model of a split air conditioning system, as shown below. ● A thermodynamic model of split air conditioning is established to describe the relationship between indoor temperature and air conditioning operation power, physical parameters of buildings, and outdoor temperature. ● According to the thermal comfort theory of the human body, the temperature range meeting the thermal comfort requirements of the human body is determined. ● Taking the boundary condition of human thermal comfort as the constraint condition, the opening and closing time expressions of the air conditioning system about the indoor temperature variables are solved according to step 1. Furthermore, the opening and closing time and operating power of the air-conditioning system under different indoor temperature settings are studied. The flexible metric model of the split air conditioning system can be defined as (6) F l e s a c s = ∫ t t + τ o n D R P 1 ( t ) d t − ∫ t t + τ o n D R \u2032 P 2 ( t ) d t where Fle sacs is the level of flexibility of the split air conditioning system. τon DR and P 1 are the operating time and operating power of the air conditioner, respectively, without implementing the control strategy during the demand response period. τon\u2019 DR and P 2 are the operating time and operating power of the air conditioner, respectively, after implementing the control strategy during the demand response period. Main research ideas for central air conditioning systems. The central air conditioning system has many components and a complex structure. In the process of demand response, the central air conditioning system has many adjustable parameters, and there are specific adjustment devices under each control strategy. According to the existing research literature and the characteristics of the central air-conditioning system, this study summarizes the research ideas of the flexibility of the central air-conditioning system, and proposes a general quantitative model of the flexibility of the central air-conditioning system. The model needs to be applied in combination with the specific control scenario of the central air-conditioning system, and the specific contents are as follows. ● Define the specific type of the central air-conditioning system, and establish the energy consumption model of each component module in the central air conditioning system. ● According to different control strategies, objective functions and constraints, analyze the energy consumption changes of each part. Subsequently, calculate the energy consumption change of the whole central air conditioning system to quantify the flexible regulation potential of the system. The model for the flexibility metric of a central air conditioning system can be defined as (7) F l e c a c s = E b e f o r e − E a f t e r where Fle cacs is the level of flexibility of the central air conditioning system; E before and E after are the energy consumptions of the central air conditioning system before and after the implementation of the control strategy. The most important regulation methods for air conditioning systems include temperature resetting, pre-cooling, and pre-heating. Among them, pre-cooling and pre-heating are the regulation methods for the combination of air conditioning system and building thermal mass, which will be described in detail in Section 3.2. The regulation method of temperature reset refers to re-adjusting the temperature setting within the thermal comfort range of the human body to reduce the energy consumption of the air conditioning system. According to engineering knowledge, a change of 1 °C in the temperature setting can reduce the power consumption of the air conditioning system by approximately 2.5% [97]. The temperature setting of the air conditioning system must meet the requirements of human thermal comfort, which is usually characterized by the predicted mean vote (PMV). Within the comfort range, the PMV value is between −0.5 and + 0.5 [114]. Therefore, it is of great significance to study the combination strategy of the factors affecting the PMV in the comfort range to reduce the operating power of the air conditioning system [115]. Table 5 shows the combination strategy of temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed to meet the thermal comfort of the human body in a hot and humid environment. 3.1.2.2 Lighting loads Lighting loads are an important component of building energy consumption. In different types of commercial buildings, the lighting system accounts for approximately 15% of the total building electricity consumption, and it can directly offload the load at the request of the grid [48,118]. In addition, compared with other electrical appliances in the building, the lighting system responds quickly with little delay. The illumination level in the building interior at any time is related only to the power output of lamps, and is not affected by the historical information [119]. Therefore, the lighting load can be a highly flexible resource in a building energy system. The metric model for the flexibility potential of the lighting load can be defined as (8) F l e l i g = { η l p l i g t D R T u r n o f f s o m e l a m p s ∫ p ( t ) − p min ( t ) d t R e g u l a t i n g i n d o o r l i g h t i n g i n t e n s i t y where Fle lig is the level of flexibility of the lighting load. η l is the percentage of luminaires turned off. p lig is the rated power of the luminaire. t DR is the time of demand response. p(t) is the real-time operating power of the luminaire without implementing control measures. p min (t) is the operating power of the luminaire to meet the minimum indoor lighting requirements. Flexible adjustment measures for lighting load mainly include turning off some lamps and changing the indoor lighting intensity [120]. During the demand response period, these two measures need to be implemented in combination with human activities and sunshine level. In unoccupied rooms, lamps need to be turned off in a timely manner. In rooms occupied by people, the operating power of the lamps in working areas without sunlight will be set to that meeting the minimum lighting requirements. In areas exposed to sunlight, the lighting intensity should be adjusted and controlled in combination with the sunshine level. Sehar et al. [121] arranged photosensitive sensors in the room and transferred the real-time lighting level, which included the contribution of sunlight, to the building energy management system. When the lighting intensity exceeds the set value, the light intensity is reduced until the set value is met. When there is sufficient daylight to maintain the lighting level, all lamps can be turned off. Chen et al. [122] concluded that at 4:10 p.m. during peak load hours in their office building, the percentage of lights turned off reached 0.8 and the daily average was 0.2. In addition, through the on/off or dimming control of some lamps, the thermal gain of the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system could be reduced, thus further reducing the building cooling load. 3.2 Thermal mass of buildings The thermal mass of buildings mainly includes the external envelope (such as exterior wall and roof) and indoor thermal mass (such as furniture and interior wall). Passive thermal storage and cold storage of the building thermal mass are often combined with the air conditioning system. During the cooling period, the building thermal mass stores the cooling capacity when the indoor air temperature decreases, and releases the cooling capacity when the indoor air temperature increases [123,124]. The principle of heat storage and release during the heating period is similar to that in the cooling period. Using this characteristic of the building thermal mass, the room can be pre-cooled and preheated in advance, and the shape of the power load curve can be changed to achieve the purpose of peak shaving and valley filling. Turner et al. [125] studied the duration of pre-cooling and pre-heating, where extended pre-cooling and pre-heating time can result in energy wastage and energy inefficiency, whereas very short pre-cooling and pre-heating time may not achieve a significant load transfer effect. Building thermal mass has a large effect on the load transfer. However, a generic quantitative model of the load transfer potential of the building thermal mass is lacking. The quantification of the load transfer potential of the building thermal mass is helpful in selecting appropriate air conditioning system equipment and optimizing the operation strategy [126]. The quantitative model for assessing the flexibility of the building thermal mass is shown below. (9) F l e b t m = ∑ i n ∫ t t + T D R h i | T i ( t ) − T i n ( t ) | A i d t C O P s y s t e m where Fle btm is the level of flexibility of the building thermal mass; i denotes the individual components of the building thermal mass; h i is the heat transfer coefficient between the different building thermal masses and indoor air; T i (t) is the surface temperature of the different building thermal masses; T in (t) is the temperature of indoor air; COP system is the coefficient of performance of the air conditioning system for cooling and heating; A i is the surface area of the building thermal mass. The formula describes the relationship between the cold and heat storage of the building thermal mass and power consumption of the air conditioning system. Each surface of the building thermal mass gains or loses heat through convective heat exchange with the indoor air. In the process, the air conditioning system provides cooling or heat. The total power consumption of the air conditioning system can be further calculated according to its performance coefficient. To calculate the area of irregular internal masses such as furniture, a new method for calculating the surface area of the building thermal mass (i.e., the effective area method) was proposed in a previous study [127]. This method defined the calculated area A i of the furniture as follows. (10) A i = m i ρ i ⋅ L i where m i is the furniture mass, ρ i is the density of the furniture, and L i indicates the size, calculated as half of the thickness of the main material. Building thermal mass can also be combined with other modulation measures. Rahimpour et al. [128] demonstrated a decrease in the energy demand of HVAC systems in buildings by using phase change materials (PCMs). The use of PCMs in lightweight buildings can be very beneficial in reducing the energy demand of HVAC systems or shifting the demand to off-peak hours. Johra et al. [129] integrated PCMs into the interior furniture, thus significantly increasing the energy flexibility potential of the house. In low-insulation and high-insulation light-structure houses, furniture with integrated PCMs can increase the energy flexibility index by 87% and 30%, respectively. In addition, cool-tone materials, which are characterized by high solar reflectivity and high thermal emissivity, can be utilized in the building façade. Compared with conventional materials, these materials keep the building structure cooler, reduce the electrical load in summer, and decrease the total building energy consumption [130]. Lu et al. [131] evaluated the flexibility potential of the building thermal mass under different boundary conditions (energy demand and power generation scenarios) and control events in combination with public power grids and renewable energy systems. 4 Demand response strategies for synergistic matching of supply-side and demand-side flexible resources Sections 1\u20133 of this paper described the concept of the BEEFS, types of flexible resources in the BEEFS, and characteristics of each flexible resource, and provided a general quantitative standard for the flexible resources for increasing the number of users participating in the grid demand response. This section describes the demand response strategies for synergistic matching of supply-side and demand-side flexible resources of the BEEFS, which addresses the problem of how to synergize and deploy flexible resources in the BEEFS. 4.1 Definition and application of demand response strategies Demand response strategies are important for building users to manage flexible resources. Demand response is defined as the change in the normal consumption mode of flexible resources owing to the change in electricity price, or the incentive payment designed to induce lesser use of electricity when the system reliability is threatened [3]. Price-based demand response refers to the spontaneous adjustment of the power consumption mode by building customers according to the price of electricity [132]. Incentive-based demand response refers to the implementation of monetary incentive policies to encourage building occupants to reduce the load [133]. In the process of incentive-based demand response, the grid will sign a contract with the building users, which stipulates that the users must reduce the load during the demand response period, failing which they will be penalized. Unlike price-based demand response, incentive-based demand response requires high response speed [134]. The classifications and explanations of the demand response are presented in Table 6 . The flexible resources of BEEFS can be controlled according to the different types of demand response. This study summarized the existing literature according to the related demand response type and flexible resource type, and analyzed the demand response strategies involving different combinations of flexible resources, as listed in Table 7 . Air conditioning systems are usually combined with the building thermal mass and their demand response activities are based on the electricity prices. Pre-cooling or pre-heating of the building thermal mass is performed when the electricity price is low. When the electricity price is high, the building thermal mass loses or gains heat, which contributes to peak shaving and valley filling for the grid. The combined energy cost of the air conditioning system and building thermal mass is influenced by the utility rate, building structure, and pre-cooling time [135]; Table 7 lists the main results related to this in literature. The objective of the price-based demand response strategy is to flatten the electricity consumption curve of the building load. In addition, the temperature reset strategy adopted after building pre-cooling and pre-heating plays an important role in reducing the peak building load and flattening the electricity consumption curve. The characteristics of the exponential temperature reset strategy, step temperature reset strategy, and linear temperature reset strategy were investigated, and the results showed that the exponential temperature and step temperature reset strategies performed better in flattening the electricity consumption curve [90,136]. The air conditioning system can also be based on incentive-based demand response strategies, such as directly shutting down some operating chillers and air conditioning units [137]. In addition, air conditioning systems and building thermal mass can be combined with RESs. When the renewable energy generation is sufficient, the power of the air conditioning system can be turned up. Conversely, when the renewable energy generation is insufficient, the power of the air conditioning system should be reduced and thermal inertia of the building thermal mass should be used to reduce the dependence on the grid [138]. Building lighting system is often studied as a separate flexible resource, which can be either price-based demand response or incentive-based demand response. Lighting systems need to be regulated by considering the balance between energy savings and visual comfort of the occupants. The combination of EVs, stationary batteries, and renewable energy is considered a promising solution to address the increasing peak-to-valley differential in electricity, increasing carbon emissions, and increasing household energy costs [139,140], which is suitable for both priced-based and incentive-based demand response strategies. With increasing use of intermittent renewable energy such as wind and solar power, the ability of EVs and stationary batteries to respond quickly to requests is particularly useful for ensuring grid stability [141]. Most researchers have studied the coordinated operation of EVs, stationary batteries, and renewable energy with the objective of reducing the operating costs, increasing renewable energy utilization, and reducing the peak load of the power grid. The main results of this approach are shown in Table 7. Tariff-based demand response strategies are often applied to domestic appliances (washing machines, dishwashers, electric water heaters), which are used as flexible resources because they have two important advantages: 1) domestic appliances need not necessarily be operated at a fixed time. 2) Domestic appliances use considerable amount of energy, especially when multiple households are considered together [142]. In view of the various types and complex scheduling of flexible resources in residential buildings, many researches have constructed household energy management systems [143,144]. The household energy management system efficiently manages the coordination between household appliances, renewable energy equipment, and energy storage devices based on the criterion of grid electricity price, which significantly reduces the energy costs for the user. The main results of this approach are shown in Table 7. Different building flexible resources are matched with different demand response types, as shown in Fig. 11 . EVs, stationary batteries, air conditioning systems, lighting equipment, and electric water heaters can be scheduled based on either price-based demand response strategies or incentive-based demand response strategies, and the remaining flexible resources are generally scheduled based on price-based demand response strategies. As shown in Table 7, in BEEFSs, we can achieve the goals of reducing operating costs by 4%\u201362% and peak power by 15%\u201396%, and improving renewable energy consumption rate by 6%\u201370%, by choosing appropriate demand response strategies and coordinating different flexible resources. In the process of building-grid interaction, building users need to select appropriate demand response strategies according to the existing flexible resource types to better achieve different types of demand response objectives. 4.2 Optimization techniques in demand response strategies Optimization techniques are key technologies to solve the problem of synergistic matching of flexible resources on the supply and demand sides of the BEEFS, which ensures the smooth implementation of demand response strategies and optimization of the goals of reducing the building peak loads, reducing the operating costs, increasing the renewable energy consumption rate, and maintaining the comfort of building occupants. The common optimization techniques mentioned in this study are described below, and the corresponding survey literature is listed in Table 8 . ● Linear programming: This method solves the maximum or minimum value of a linear objective model subject to the constraints of a linear equation or inequality. The objective model is a mathematical expression of the decision maker's requirement to achieve the goal, expressed as an extreme or minimal value. The constraints refer to the ability of the resources to achieve the goals and the internal constraints, which are expressed as a set of equations or inequalities. If all decision variables are integers, integer linear programming is applied; if some of the decision variables are integers, they can be represented through the mixed-integer linear programming technique. Linear programming methods are computationally fast and easy to use, but it is not suitable for complex systems. ● Nonlinear planning: Unlike linear planning, nonlinear planning has one or more nonlinear models in the objective model or constraints. If the decision variables include integer variables and continuous variables, mixed-integer nonlinear programming is applied. The nonlinear programming technique is suitable for complex systems. ● Stochastic optimization: This optimization method incorporates uncertainty, where all or some of the decision variables are uncertain and follow a certain probability distribution. In deterministic optimization, the decision variables are known to be exact values. Stochastic programming techniques not only consider the existing constraints, but also the uncertain factors generated in the problem. There are many uncertainties in BEEFSs, such as the charging and discharging behavior of EVs and usage of building equipment. Common methods to achieve stochastic planning are Monte Carlo sampling and sample average approximation. ● Robust optimization: Similar to stochastic optimization, robust optimization considers the uncertainty of information and ambiguity of data. Robust optimization is a new modeling approach to study uncertain optimization problems. It originates from robust control theory and is a complementary replacement of stochastic optimization and sensitivity analysis. The objective of robust optimization is to seek a solution that performs well for all realizations of uncertain inputs. The method differs from stochastic optimization in that it does not assume a distribution of the uncertain parameters, i.e., every possible value is equally important; it represents the most conservative outcome under the worst-case scenario. ● Meta heuristics: Meta heuristics were proposed in the context of optimization algorithms. An optimization algorithm can obtain the optimal solution of a problem. In contrast, the meta heuristic algorithm can provide a feasible solution of the problem at an acceptable cost (i.e. computing time and space). It is based on intuition or experience, and the deviation between the feasible and optimal solutions cannot be predicted in advance. When compared with many other classical optimization techniques, this method has higher computing efficiency, shorter computing time, and stronger ability to solve highly complex problems. The meta heuristic algorithm can better solve the scheduling problem of many flexible resources in buildings. However, the algorithm can easily converge prematurely and fall into the local minimum or maximum. Meta heuristic algorithms used in demand response include simulated annealing, genetic, ant colony optimization, particle swarm optimization, and artificial neural network algorithms. ● Game theory: Game theory is a discipline wherein the related parties implement strategies across multiple individuals or teams under specific conditions. It is based on the phenomenon of struggle or competition. In the selection process, the successful choice of an individual depends on the choices made by other individuals. A goal of the game theory is to predict the possible outcomes of a choice-based game. In such games, the causal relationships between multiple individuals influence each other's outcomes, and the ultimate goal of the game theory is to provide the optimal outcome for each individual. The building demand response process has many stakeholders such as building users, grid operators, and grid generators. 5 Discussion This research systematically reviewed the definition and components of BEEFS, and presented a general quantitative model of flexible resources. Sections 1\u20134 defined a BEEFS, clarified the scheduling that can be implemented when a building performs demand response, quantified the flexibility of each flexible resource, and explained how to deploy several flexible resources. 5.1 Quantitative models of flexibility The quantitative model of the flexible resources of a building is the basis for the demand response regulation strategy performed by buildings, which facilitates the application of BEEFSs. Table 9 summarizes the flexibility quantification models in different energy systems. These flexibility quantification models are often for specific systems composed of several flexible resources. These quantitative models or methods in specific energy systems or scenarios have achieved varying degrees of success. However, it is difficult to extend them to other general energy systems. In addition, Li et al. [26,27] reviewed various flexibility indicators and summarized the more popular flexibility indicators, including indicators to evaluate the changes in peak power and energy consumption, energy cost changes, and greenhouse gas emissions. These flexibility quantitative indicators focus on the evaluation of the overall flexibility performance of buildings, and some indicators (such as cost, greenhouse gas emissions) need to be used based on the specific scenario of pricing signals. Building electric energy systems are complex and flexible resources are more, so a general flexible quantitative model is required. The general quantitative model of flexible resources in the building electric energy system is not a combination of individual models extracted from existing studies that can be used. This is because most of these models are specific to a particular operational system or scenario and are coupled to each other, and all have their own specific input and output parameters. In addition [26\u201328], et al. mentioned in their research that a general and standardized flexible quantitative model needs to be established in the future to better serve grid-interactive buildings. This study systematically summarizes the common flexible resources in the building electric energy system. Based on the existing research and combined with the characteristics of flexible resources, a general flexible quantitative model is proposed, and the quantitative indicators for the overall and local flexible resources of the building are formed. Based on this, managers can not only calculate the respective flexibility potential of different flexible resources, but also calculate the overall flexibility of the building electric energy system. In the building design or operation stage, the flexibility potential of flexible resources in different electric energy systems can be compared or aggregated using the general flexibility quantification model, which can better serve the demand response process of buildings and power grids. The flexible quantification model proposed in this study focuses on the flexibility of energy consumption changes in buildings and does not involve the quantification of energy costs, greenhouse gases, etc. This study constructs an overall framework for the flexibility quantification of building electric energy systems, which can be further expanded in the future. Regarding the evaluation of building electric energy performance, in addition to the existing evaluation indexes such as building energy efficiency [181], the flexibility of a building electric energy system should be a key index to evaluate the building electric energy performance. By integrating the general quantitative model proposed in this study, the overall building flexibility evaluation index and the index for each flexible resource are expressed as follows: (11) F l e t o t a l = ∑ i n | F l e i | (12) Φ = F l e t o t a l / E t o t a l (13) Φ i = F l e i / E t o t a l where Fle total indicates the total flexibility of the building electric energy system, Fle i indicates the flexibility of each flexible resource, and E total indicates the baseline energy consumption of the building. Φ indicates the overall building flexibility evaluation index, and Φ i indicates the flexibility evaluation index of each flexible resource of the building. According to the above, the flexibility quantification model and flexibility evaluation index of a building electric energy system are shown in Fig. 12 . The quantification and evaluation of the BEEFS is of great significance to the construction of grid-responsive buildings. In future research, the scope of the flexibility evaluation index of a building electric energy system can be further expanded, the characteristics of each index can be studied, the weights of the indexes can be assigned, appropriate evaluation methods can be selected, and a multi-level flexibility evaluation index system for the building electric energy system can be established. In addition, most of the studies on BEEFSs in the reviewed literature are based on simulation methods, which explore the flexible characteristics of building electric energy systems from the theoretical perspective. However, the flexible resources of a building can deviate from the theoretical values in the actual scheduling process. Therefore, future research should further study the flexible characteristics of building electric energy systems based on the actual situation, summarize the deviations between theory and practice, and control and schedule the flexible resources of building electric energy systems more precisely. 5.2 Flexible resources In terms of supply-side flexible resources, renewable energy power generation technology can not only directly meet part of the building load and reduce the building's demand for the power grid, but also reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Owing to the intermittence and uncertainty of renewable energy power generation, it is difficult for buildings to fully utilize the potential of renewable energy. To solve this problem, on the one hand, a more accurate generation prediction model can be established based on stochastic optimization algorithms [183]. On the other hand, other flexible resources need to be coordinated, including the combination of renewable energy generation technology and electric energy storage devices, and the combination of renewable energy and demand-side flexible resources. Buildings that combine renewable energy and power storage devices are becoming increasingly popular. The energy storage device will be charged during the surplus period of renewable energy generation and discharged during the shortage period to maximize the utilization rate of renewable energy. Many studies have improved the self-consumption rate of photovoltaic power generation by shifting shiftable load to the peak period of photovoltaic power generation [159\u2013162]. Electric energy storage devices and EVs, as important flexible resources in building electric energy system, can achieve multiple objectives such as demand shift, peak load adjustment, and rapid response. In the BEEFS, the use of an electric energy storage device can not only improve the self-consumption rate of renewable energy, but also achieve economic benefits by optimizing the charging and discharging process of the energy storage device. In optimizing the energy system with energy storage devices, real-time management is more effective than predictive model management. Prediction algorithms are usually nonlinear and inaccurate, and these optimization algorithms are usually very complex, so it is difficult to implement [160]. Notably, the size and service life of electric energy storage devices are important factors affecting the application of batteries in buildings. The size of the energy storage device can be determined according to 0.5\u20131 times of the installed capacity of renewable energy [64]. Builders need to fully consider the cost of battery aging to use it with the greatest economic feasibility. EVs have similar characteristics to electric energy storage devices, but the difference is that EVs have space-time transfer characteristics. EVs often travel between residential and office areas. According to the measured results of this study, the travel parameters of EVs conform to the law of normal distribution. In the process of demand response in which EVs participate, we need to consider this law to develop the flexibility potential of EVs more accurately. In terms of demand-side flexible resources, the shift characteristics of a shiftable load are used to make it work at a lower electricity price period, which plays a role of peak shaving and valley filling. Once these devices are started, they usually do not shut down until the end of the limited period. Managers need to pay attention to the set time window and the running time of shiftable loads. In addition, to benefit from shiftable loads, the single-objective optimization model is usually used to optimize the starting time of shiftable loads to minimize the energy cost within a specific range of electricity prices. The energy consumption of HVAC system accounts for a relatively high proportion of the total energy consumption of buildings, resulting in a large peak demand in summer and winter [97,98]. Temperature setpoint reset is a common control strategy for HVAC systems. By changing the temperature setpoint, peak load during peak hours can be reduced. However, we need to pay attention to the power rebound after the demand response. The HVAC system can store the cold/heat capacity in the thermal mass of the building through precooling and preheating. Then, during the peak demand period, the thermal mass of buildings will release cold and heat, which provides load shift and load shedding services for the grid. In addition, when adjusting the HVAC system, it is necessary to balance the distribution of water and air flow in the system. Lighting systems are widely used in buildings and combined with natural light to achieve human visual comfort. When the natural light meets the indoor lighting requirements, the lighting lamps can be turned off. When the natural light cannot fully meet the requirements, the lighting intensity shall be adjusted and controlled in combination with the sunshine level. In the face of a large number of flexible resources in the BEEFS, it is very important to coordinate and match the supply-side and demand-side flexible resources. In the process of collaborative matching, we need to clarify the requirements of the power grid and select appropriate demand response strategies and optimization technologies according to the types and characteristics of flexible resources in the system. With the summarized strategies, operating costs and peak power can be reduced by 4%\u201322% and 15%\u201396%, respectively, while renewable energy consumption rate can be increased by 6%\u201370%. 6 Conclusion BEEFSs have gradually gained importance in scenarios such as reducing carbon emissions, smoothing out renewable energy fluctuations, peak shaving and valley filling, and providing auxiliary services. This study comprehensively reviewed the existing research and analyzed the supply-side and demand-side flexible resources of building electric energy systems. The following main conclusions were drawn: ● Renewable energy is an important flexible resource on the supply side of BEEFS, which can not only cover part of the building load and reduce the pressure on the grid, but also reduce the building CO2 emission. Although renewable energy generation is affected by weather conditions and has large uncertainty, its combination with energy storage devices greatly enhances its flexibility. In addition, the use of renewable energy and energy storage devices in the building clusters can improve the overall flexibility of the building clusters and consumption rate of renewable energy. ● In addition to being able to cooperate with renewable energy generation devices, the electric energy storage device has great flexibility and can adapt to the demand response over different time scales. In particular, the rapid increase in the number of EVs in recent years has made it possible to use electric energy storage devices on a large scale. ● The flexible loads and thermal mass of buildings can enhance the flexibility of building electric energy systems without extensive retrofitting and new investments. For example, shiftable loads can be deferred or shifted from peak load periods to off-peak periods. Shedable loads can be reduced during peak load periods by resetting the temperature, adjusting the illuminance of lamps, etc. The thermal inertia of the building thermal mass can be used to pre-cool or pre-heat rooms to reduce energy consumption of the air conditioning systems during the peak period. In addition, when adjusting the flexible load of building electric energy systems, it is necessary to consider the effect of the regulation strategy on the indoor environment of the building, including the thermal comfort and visual comfort of the occupants. ● Appropriate demand response strategies can be selected according to the types and characteristics of flexible resources in building electric energy systems. On this basis, the objectives of flexible systems were clarified, and suitable optimization techniques were identified to reduce the peak load of buildings, reduce operation cost, improve consumption rate of renewable energy, etc. The various flexible resources in BEEFSs have different characteristics. Researchers should not consider only a single flexible resource. In the actual scheduling process, various flexible resources should be utilized in an integrated manner according to the type of building and characteristics of flexible resources to develop their demand response potential to the maximum extent.

        "dc:description": "The problems of continuous rise in global power consumption, gradual increase in the peak\u2013valley difference of power systems, and continuous expansion of renewable energy penetration have caused the power system regulation to shift from the traditional supply side to demand side. Buildings have huge power consumption and great energy flexibility, making them one of the most important units on the demand side of a power system. This study performed a detailed review of 183 literatures on flexible energy resources. The review has been carried out from the supply and demand side and demand response strategy side. Based on the results of the analysis and discussion, we proposed seven general quantitative models of flexibility for commonly used flexible resources, which lays the foundation for the flexibility evaluation of the building electric energy flexible system (BEEFS) and implementation of demand response strategies. In addition, the optimization techniques commonly used in demand response strategies are analyzed to achieve different goals. The results show that the combination of these strategies and optimization techniques can achieve the goals of reducing operating costs (OCs) by 4%\u201342%, reducing peak power (PP) by 15%\u201396%, and improving renewable energy consumption rate (RECR) by 6%\u201370%. This study constructs an overall framework for the flexibility quantification of building electric energy systems, which can be further expanded in the future. In the process of interaction between the building and the grid, appropriate demand response strategies and optimization techniques need to be selected according to the types and characteristics of flexible resources to achieve the goals in the demand response process.",
