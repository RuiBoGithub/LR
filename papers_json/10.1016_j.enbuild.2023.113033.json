The emergence of viral variants has driven a continuous pandemic with a higher possibility of airborne transmission and a larger scale of infective cases, posing greater demands on indoor risk control. However, the role of room-level air recirculation systems (RRSs) in infection control remains unclear due to insufficient detailed research. There are also fewer analyses of the filtering rating of recirculation filters from the perspective of multi-scale particle size. Thus, a simulation procedure to assess the performance of RRSs on infection control that accounts the transient recirculation of real virus-laden particles in multi-scale sizes was proposed, and focusing on recirculation filter strategies to balance the risk limitation and energy cost. A poorly ventilated winter classroom was selected as a typical environment equipped with RRSs to operate this procedure. Different RRS strategies (i.e., wall-mounted air conditioners (WMAC), floor-standing air conditioners (FSAC) and 4-way cassette air conditioners (WCAC)) were compared. The results show the important contribution of recirculated particles to accumulating the overall infection risk of susceptible occupants towards a high basic reproduction number (Ro > 1). Then, there is a strong correlation of the spatial distributions between high-risk zones and large vortexes at the breathing height of susceptible occupants. Considering rating suitability and filtration effectiveness, the optimization of recirculation filters on energy and cost can be suggested with comparable benefits of infection control.

Recently, Omicron variants have driven a continuous pandemic wave worldwide, which has led to more cluster outbreaks and larger-scale infected cases due to the higher potential contribution of airborne transmission [3,4]. Inhalable virus-laden airborne respiratory particles (diameter < 100 μm) can travel room-scale distances and remain suspended with typical room air speeds (e.g., 0.1 m/s for most thermal comfort designs) [5]. To provide a safe indoor environment minimizing the cross-infection risk of occupants, investigations on indoor airflow patterns and respiratory particle transmission are both the prerequisite conditions [6]. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has been widely employed as a fast, reliable and affordable technique in these studies and to better support mitigation measures, such as mechanical ventilation patterns [7\u20139], window opening strategies [10\u201312], glass barriers [13,14] and stand-alone air cleaners [15,16]. However, the role of room-level air recirculation systems (RRSs), such as split air conditioning units and fan-coil units, in infection control remains unclear due to insufficient detailed research [17]. In general, the RRS relies on room units to recirculate indoor air for heating and cooling, without an integrated fresh air supply and polluted air exhaust [18], and is generally designed in classrooms [19], offices [20], restaurants [21] and other multi-room scenarios. Although researchers have conducted extensive evaluations of room air conditioning performance based on thermal comfort and perceived air quality [22\u201324], the correlation between airflow distribution and infection risk has not been quantitatively identified. In addition, once suspended respiratory particles reach the return vents with the airflow, the recirculation of particles occurs within the unit interior, resupplying particles to the room environment. However, unlike gaseous contaminants, filters built into room units can be auxiliary at removing virus-laden inhalable particles to reduce the infection risk of occupants. Many numerical studies of particle dispersion in rooms designed with RRS use a removal boundary on return vents. For example, Zhuang et al. [25] compared the removal and deposition of well-mixed particles under two different air-conditioning systems: central air conditioners and split air conditioners. A simple empty chamber model was adopted, and particles were considered to have escaped from the room on return vents. Considering the risk of virus-laden particles transported from infected to susceptible individuals, Bhat et al. [20] investigated the influence of recirculation airflow on respiratory droplets in a conference room, where a split air conditioning unit was also assumed to remove returned particles. This boundary setup is suitable for MERV 13 or higher filtration ratings, while the existing recirculation filters of RRS are common at MERV 8 or lower (limited by dimensions and costs), with insufficient filtration of fine particles (diameter < 5 μm) [26]. In this aspect, Li et al. [21] considered the filtering effect (20%) of fan-coil units on particles to predict concentrations of infectious virus-containing droplet nuclei (5 μm) in a retrospective study of a restaurant outbreak. In a classroom scenario, Foster et al. [27] also applied a filtering efficiency of 72% to the mass-averaged concentration of passive scalars at the return vents. Shao et al. [28] proposed a mathematical method to predict the transport process of a contaminant with air recirculation, testing cases under air cleaning efficiencies of 0% and 30%. It is easy to find that there are limited simulations of real particle recirculation based on the Eulerian\u2013Lagrangian model, especially under multi-scale sizes of virus-laden particles, with difficulty in drawing a complete picture for the infection control of RRS at different filtering ratings. Thus, this study aims to propose a simulation procedure to assess the performance of RRS on infection control that accounts the transient recirculation of real virus-laden particles in multi-scale sizes and focuses on recirculation filter strategies to balance the risk limitation and energy cost. Because school classrooms are typical indoor environments that are equipped with RRSs, reported with the possibility of rapid virus transmission and a high class-specific attack rate [29], this procedure was then applied to a poorly ventilated winter classroom under different types of RRSs. A teacher, which typically talks loudly in a classroom, is assumed to be infected by Omicron variants and thus continuously emitting virus-laden particles. Indeed, the studies of a hamster model [30] and ex vivo explant cultures of the human bronchi and lung parenchyma [31] both found that Omicron variants exhibit a lower replication rate in the lung and tendency in the upper respiratory tract, where multi-scale particles (diameter 5\u2013100 μm) can be mass-produced when speaking loudly [5]. In Section 2, the methodology details of the proposed procedure are shown with an example of a classroom environment. Section 3 validates the numerical setup. In Section 4, the dispersion characteristics of respiratory particles are first discussed in correlation to the different recirculation airflow fields. Then, with distinction of particles by recirculation fates, the overall infection risk in terms of accumulated dose was assessed for the susceptible students during a lesson of 40 min, and the characteristics of local risk distribution were identified and compared. Finally, based on the size distribution of particles within the breathing zone, the rating suitability and filtration effectiveness of room-level recirculation filters were evaluated in terms of viral load in the air. 2 Methodological details of the procedure The proposed simulation procedure to assess the performance of RRS on infection control is illustrated in Fig. 1 . First, detailed information on indoor scenarios of interest should be determined, including the room configuration and room-level air recirculation system. Then, numerical treatments are successively performed on the computational mesh, boundary condition, multi-scale particle emission and Eulerian\u2013Lagrangian solver. The basic airflow field of air recirculation is obtained under the steady mode with particle emission sources off. When switching to transient mode, the particle source of the infected begins to emit multi-scale virus-laden particles, and a series of dose-risk conversions continues as the particles spread. The particle emission source of the RRS is initially set to the off state until there are particles collected by the return vents. Finally, with the size distribution of virus-laden particles within the breathing zone, the evaluation of recirculation filters is conducted. In general, four parts of methodology are involved within the proposed procedure: physical model (Section 2.1), numerical model (Section 2.2), particle recirculation mechanism (Section 2.3) and dose-risk conversion (Section 2.4). 2.1 Physical model 2.1.1 Classroom environment The selected room environment is a classroom, where mechanical ventilation systems (e.g., dedicated outdoor air systems) are not commonly found, and it is more economical to choose natural ventilation by opening windows [32]. However, the ensuing high level of occupant intervention in ventilation may lead to an inadequate air change rate under extreme outdoor conditions, particularly on cold winter days [33]. Thus, coupled with the high density of occupants and long duration of stay, control of infection transmission in the winter classroom environment is always a concern during the COVID-19 pandemic. A standard winter classroom (9.00 × 8.00 × 3.80 m) with forty students and a male teacher was designed as shown in Fig. 2 . There are six push\u2013pull windows (1.00 × 1.90 m) for daylighting and full ventilation in the transition season. Six top hung windows (1.00 × 0.60 m) and two transom windows (1.00 × 0.30 m) above the door (1.20 × 2.20 m) were used to provide fresh air during class time in winter, which can alleviate the discomfort caused by the high CO2 levels and direct draught of cold air. Under the anti-epidemic requirement [34] and school design code [35], three primary distance controls were considered: 2.40 m between the blackboard and the front row; 1.80 m between the back wall and the last row; and 1.00 m between each student. The simplified student model is consistent with the study by Abuhegazy et al. [14], while the desk sizes are adjusted to 0.65 × 0.45 × 0.16 m. The infected teacher with a 1.97 cm2 mouth opening area was standing in the middle of the lectern (1.60 × 0.60 × 1.00 m) and facing the students [36] . 2.1.2 Types of room-level recirculation systems The room units of the RRS operate under a recirculation mechanism in which the indoor air from return vents is directly handled by a heat exchanger and then resupplied to the room through supply vents. As shown in Fig. 3 , we investigated the following three widely used RRS strategies [22\u201324], the sizes of which were determined according to the real products. The inclination angles of the supply vents were assumed to be 45° for the upper room units and 90° for the lower room units in order to alleviate the thermal stratification and sensation of draught [37]. Moreover, with the room areas and the general load index [38], the air-conditioning load of this classroom can be initially obtained, and the number of installed units of each RRS can be determined through the division of the room load by the rated capacity per unit: (a) Wall-mounted air conditioners (WMAC) with \u201csingle-supply and single-return\u201d were arranged as double units clinging to the wall adjacent to the teacher, with a distance of 5.90 m between them to better handle the total room load. (b) Floor-standing air conditioner (FSAC) with \u201csingle-supply and two-return\u201d was arranged as a single unit standing in a front corner position of the classroom, with a distance of 0.60 m away from the wall and a placement angle of 45°. (c) 4-way cassette air conditioners (WCAC) with \u201cfour-supply and single-return\u201d were arranged as double units hanging side-by-side in the middle of ceiling, with the distance between them equal to half the length of the classroom. 2.2 Numerical model 2.2.1 Mesh generation and independence analysis The poly mesh [39,40] was generated as shown in Fig. 4 . Since airborne particles appear to be highly nonuniform in a large room, it is necessary to assess the infection risk of occupants based on the \u201cbreathing zone\u201d instead of the overall room volume. Separated by the virtual interface adjacent to students, the computational zone was divided into two zones. The zone containing students (hereinafter referred to as \u201cstudent-zone\u201d) was herein considered as \u201cbreathing-zone\u201d (5.00 × 8.00 × 1.80 m), which is slightly smaller than the standard volume defined by ASHRAE [41] in consideration of the detailed risk evaluation on the susceptible students. Beyond local refinement to critical surfaces (e.g., vents and occupants), mesh inflation layers were created around all surfaces that can accurately capture the thermal buoyancy flow properties [42] and the collision of particles with the walls [43]. The first cell height adjacent to the surface is 2.00 mm, corresponding to an average y+ value of 1.80 (occupants) and 1.30 (walls and desks) [40] . In accordance with the above descriptions, three different mesh sets were designed for the grid-independence test, where the total cell numbers are approximately 0.75 million, 1.50 million and 3.50 million. By balancing simulation precision and cost, the setup of medium mesh was adopted for each case of RRS, which has an acceptable mesh quality for skewness (0.15) and orthogonal quality (0.85). The local refinement was determined as follows: air conditioner vents = 0.03 m; ventilation window = 0.04 m; desks = 0.04 m; students = 0.04 m; teacher = 0.02 m; and open mouth = 0.002 m. 2.2.2 Boundary conditions and particle emission For this poorly ventilated classroom in winter, a temperature of 271.25 K was applied to the outdoor air. For heat loss of the exterior envelope, the heat transfer coefficients (U-value) were set to 0.60 W/(m2·K) for facades and 2.20 W/(m2·K) for windows [44]. Note that in both cases better solutions are available, but that is not of interest here. The interior walls and desks were both set to be adiabatic, neglecting the marginal temperature difference between adjacent air-conditioned rooms. Because occupants (i.e., students and teachers) prefer to keep windows and doors closed for thermal comfort during class time, only the top hung window and transom window were available for ventilation, and the inlet velocity on the top hung window was set at 0.045 m/s normal to the surfaces, which equals a ventilation rate of 4 l/s per person, ensuring a minimum magnitude of fresh air in poorly ventilated classrooms [45]. The WMAC and WCAC recirculated indoor air at a constant mass flow rate of 0.2892 kg/s per unit while 0.5784 kg/s per unit in the FSAC, corresponding to a medium airflow velocity (∼2 m/s) [46]. To achieve equivalent heat gain via each RRS, the supplied air temperature was fixed at 308 K. In this study, the returned air was pre-estimated to have a temperature of 295.15 K, which is consistent with the interior temperature recommended for winter [47]. As concern the thermal boundary conditions of the occupants, the metabolic heat generation of this teacher and students was set at 100 W/m2 (an adult walking) and 45 W/m2 (a child writing) [48] and simplified as a full contribution of convective flux. Although the metabolic heat can also be transferred to the environment by evaporation, respiration and especially radiation, there is uncertainty in different environmental conditions and personnel situations. The release of all metabolic heat by surface convection would enhance the thermal plume near the occupants, which is in fact a conservative treatment for the inhalable infection risk. The details of the boundary conditions setup are listed in Table 1 . In the present case study with an infected male teacher, virus-laden particles (density = 1200 kg/m3) were introduced into the room via an exhaled airflow from the mouth. According to the experimental results of Gupta et al. [36], most of the exhalation take place through the mouth, and the average flow rate can be used as the boundary condition of the mouth for modelling the exhalation during speaking. Thus, a velocity of 1.941 m/s [49] was taken as the average value during the exhalation process of the teacher [36]. The temperature of the exhaled airflow was set at 307.15 K [50]. According to the experimental data conducted by Johnson et al. [51], the original particle distributions can be simplified into five size ranges below 90 μm during breathing and speaking [52]. We noted that the teacher frequently speaks louder in class than in normal conversation [53]; thus, the particle emission character associated with voice loudness described by Asadi et al. [54] was adopted to consider a 10-fold increase in the emission rate between speaking loudly and quietly, together with the insensitive particle size distributions [54]. Dynamic evaporation process was neglected [55], and the emitted respiratory particles were assumed to be in a post-evaporation state, with 1% of their original volume before evaporation. This means that respiratory particle dispersion is driven by the post-evaporation particle size, distinguished from the pre-evaporation particle size applied in the estimation of viral load. In Table 2 , the particle size distribution for speaking loudly was imposed on the injection initialization at a total rate of 1310 parcel/s. Finally, the fate of particles colliding with surfaces can be defined as \u201ctrap\u201d, \u201creflect\u201d and \u201cescape\u201d at different surface types, as also shown in Table 1. 2.2.3 Eulerian\u2013Lagrangian solver The Eulerian\u2013Lagrangian solver was employed to track the dispersion of the discrete airborne particles [56], with one-way coupling between the continuum phase and the discrete phase being adopted due to the low volume concentration (〈10−6) of the particles in air. The Eulerian approach can be described by the RANS equations of mass, momentum transport, and energy. In this study of an unsteady incompressible airflow field, the Shear Stress Transport (SST) k\u2013ω model was applied to predict the turbulent airflow [40,52,57]. Compared with other turbulence models (e.g., Standard and Renormalization Group of k-ε model), the SST k\u2013ω model achieves better performance with temperature stratification in indoor environments, accurately capturing the impact of the thermal plume [58]. Furthermore, for the SST k\u2013ω model, the near wall region was solved all the way downward to the viscous sub-layer, without additional wall functions. The buoyancy effect induced by temperature differences was included using the Boussinesq approximation. The Lagrangian approach calculated the trajectory of each individual particle by solving Newton\u2019s second law at the particle time step. The dynamic motion of particles is influenced by several forces. In addition to the two dominant parts of the drag and gravitational forces, the thermophoretic and Saffman lift forces were both incorporated into the force balance in consideration of the non-isothermal environment and existence of small particles (2.5\u20135.0 μm) [59]. The discrete random walk (DRW) model was used to consider the impact of local turbulence intensities on particle dispersion. Finally, because the one-way coupling treatment can only obtain the particle trajectory without concentration distribution, the particle source in the cell scheme (PSI-C) was predefined to associate the particle concentration with its trajectory in each cell [56]. These models were all solved using the commercial CFD program ANSYS Fluent. The velocity\u2013pressure coupled equations were solved by the SIMPLE algorithm. Pressure staggering option (PRESTO!) scheme was selected for pressure discretization, and the second-order upwind scheme was selected for the other items. The flow time step was set to 0.2 s (mean Courant number was 0.4) and the total simulated time was 40 min. For the numerical convergence criterion, the residual value was <10−4 for all quantities except energy, where it should be <10−6. The net heat flux in the domain was also checked to be <1% of the total heat gain. 2.3 Particle recirculation mechanism Based on the current Eulerian\u2013Lagrangian solver, the recirculation mechanism realizing the matching transport of particles through room units is illustrated in Fig. 5 . First, there are two particle recirculation fates marked by the update of the particle scalar: Recirculated (one or more recirculation experiences) and Uncirculated (no recirculation experience). The recirculation experience herein means the particle transport from return vents to supply vents within room units in terms of no filtration effect. With such a dichotomy of total particles in the computational domain, the connection between air recirculation and airborne risk can be better explored in different contributions of these two types of particles. Second, the interior of the room unit was neglected, without computational meshes, resulting in the problem of particle matching between the return and supply vents. We introduced a new emission source on supply vents for recirculated particles, which works with the same particle number collected by the return vents in the previous time step. Three assumptions were also considered: (1) inactivation of the virus carried by particles passing through the room unit was neglected since the residence time is only a few seconds [60]; (2) the spatial particle distribution at the supply vent was simplified to a convergent point as the emission source; and (3) for WCAC, the particle streams at each return vent were evenly assigned among the four supply vents. Third, it should be emphasized that, different from the simulation of a single particle size, multi-scale groups (e.g., 1, 1.9, 5, 9.8, and 16.8 μm in this study) require additional treatments to capture the particle size distribution on return vents, which can guarantee the dynamic mass balance based on particle size during the recirculation process. As flexible extensions of the commercial CFD program, user-defined functions (UDFs) were implemented for data transmission of particle streams from return vents (UDF_BC) to point emissions (UDF_INIT) with tested recirculation balance of particle number and mass. 2.4 Dose-risk conversion To evaluate the room-level recirculation effect on the risk of airborne transmission of an infected teacher in a poorly ventilated classroom, the framework of infection risk evaluation proposed by Motamedi et al. [61] was adopted based on the particle concentration field. With a quanta defined as the dose of airborne particles inhaled to cause infection in 63% of susceptible occupants, the quanta concentration ( C q t , quanta/m3) can be easily described by: (1) C q t = E R q ∙ C p - post,c t I R i ∙ C p - post,i where E R q is the quanta emission rate (quanta/h); I R i is the exhalation rate of the infected occupant (m3/h); C p - post,c t and C p - post,i are the particle volume concentration (ml/m3) simulated in each spatial cell and exhaled by the infector, respectively, both of which relate to the post-evaporation state; I R i and C p - post,i were set equal to 1.38 m3/h and 4.75 × 10−4 ml/m3 in magnitude for a male teacher walking and speaking loudly. For SARS-CoV-2, the quanta emission rate was estimated on the basis of work carried by Buonanno et al., where E R q in different percentiles was calculated for various expiratory parameters by the Monte-Carlo method. A high fitness of E R q was found between a narrow range of the 90th-95th percentile and the retrospective analysis of early superspreading events. Indeed, superspreading events have an important role in the accumulation of mutations that contribute to the generation of predominant variants [62]. A recent surveillance study [63] and a quantitative experiment [3] both showed that the Omicron variant is truly more transmissible than other variants. Although studies of whether Omicron infectors generally reach the emission levels of early superspreading events are still lacking, using the E R q of 490 quanta/h (95th percentile) seems to be appropriate for crowded classrooms [64] out of concern for large outbreaks. On the other hand, the E R q of up to thousands (e.g., 1023 quanta/h estimated from an Omicron outbreak in a Hong Kong restaurant [65]) was not considered because such super emissions may still be rare for Omicron infections. The accumulated dose of quanta ( D q , quanta) inhaled by an exposed occupant can be calculated by integrating the quanta concentration over time as follows: (2) D q = I R e ∫ 0 T C q ( t ) d t where I R e is the inhalation rate of the exposed occupant (m3/h) and T is the exposure time (h). We investigated a typical lesson period (40 min) during which students are always seated with a focus on the active teacher. In this study, the difference should be noted that the inhalation rate of exposed students (0.44 m3/h) is only equivalent to 1/3 that of the infected teacher (1.38 m3/h) [49]. Finally, the exponential dose\u2013response model simplified from Poisson summation equations was chosen to calculate the probability of infection ( P I ) at a certain inhaled dose of quanta [52,61,66]: (3) P I = 1 - E X P - D q In particular, the volume-average inhaled dose within the student-zone was monitored to estimate the overall exposure level of the forty students [40], which should be limited to below a probability of 0.01 (1%) as low risk adopted in this study [67]. Controlling the basic reproduction number (R0) is also important, which is evaluated by multiplying the overall probability of infection by the number of exposed occupants (40 students). Even if P I > 0.01, the number of secondary cases can still be effectively controlled with R0 < 1 rather than worsening to a large-scale outbreak [68]. 3 Numerical validation Since the airflow field and particle dispersion characteristics of the present confined space are formed by the combined effect of air supply and buoyancy, with the influence of indoor obstacles (i.e., many student manikins), the experimental data of Zhang and Chen were used to validate the accuracy of the numerical method. The experiment was conducted in a full-scale ventilated room (4.91 m × 4.31 m × 2.44 m) with two floor air supply inlets and one ceiling exhaust. Fresh air was supplied to the room at a total flow rate of 0.0944 m3/s. Four simplified human manikins and six lamps are placed as the primary heat source to satisfy non-isothermal conditions. Once the thermal steady state was reached and recorded, monodisperse spherical particles with a mean particle size of 0.7 μm were released from the source position (X = 3.3 m, Y = 0.3 m, Z = 2.1 m). More details about the experiment are provided in the literature [69]. As representatives of the proximity to the human body and the centre of the room, data on monitoring points V2-V3 (velocity), T2-T3 (temperature) and P2 ∼ P3 (particle concentration) were selected for comparison between the experiment and simulation. In addition, normalizations for temperature (T* = (T-Tsupply)/(Texhaust-Tsupply)) and concentration (C* = C/Cexhaust) were applied. As shown in Fig. 6 , the simulation results using the numerical methods described above are in acceptable agreement with the experimental data [69], which forms confidence in further analysis of the non-isothermal airflow field and particle dispersion in a ventilated room. 4 Results and discussion 4.1 Airflow distribution and particle dispersion A steady recirculation airflow field is necessary and first obtained before simulation of respiratory particle dispersion. According to the indoor air conditioning standard [47], the basic occupant comfort in the three cases was satisfactory, with an average air velocity below 0.2 m/s and an average air temperature above 21℃ in the student-zone. Then, to identify the characteristics of recirculation airflow fields under RRS operation, the airflow distributions at student breathing height (z = 1.10 m) and teacher breathing height (z = 1.85 m) are illustrated in Fig. 7 . In comparison, the airflow distributions of the two breathing heights are highly different. Influence by obstructions of students and desks, the horizontal air flow at the student breathing height appears to be weakened with the appearance of multi-scale vortices. However, at the teacher breathing height, it is easy to find the air flow that is characterized by a horizontal direction, along with dominant large vortices. For example, in the case of WMAC, two large vortices of comparable size are generated symmetrically with the direction of airflow at the intersection towards the teacher. The variance in air flow near the teacher should also be highlighted for the appearance of two opposite directions between breathing heights. The airflow distribution of the recirculation mode has an important role in the dispersion of respiratory particles. In Fig. 8 , the particle dispersion during the initial period (<60 s) is displayed for different RRS cases. In the WMAC case, the emitted particles are entrained into the horizontal direction (along the Y-axis) and then disperse along the wall into the student-zone by a dominant clockwise vortex. Due to the limited vertical dispersion of particles on the wall, the return vents of WMAC cannot capture the main particle streams, resulting in most particles being recirculated only from the student-zone. For the FSAC case, the particles are ejected directly (along the X-axis) into the student-zone with the assistance of an anticlockwise vortex near the teacher. Although the particle dispersions in the WMAC and FSAC cases are not identical, their dispersion paths can also be considered as \u201cteacher-student-vent\u201d. However, for the case of WCAC in operation, the emitted particles are quickly changed into the opposite direction and then continue to move up along the wall. With the accumulation of particles near the ceiling by vertical temperature stratification [70], the front WCAC unit hung at a certain height is surrounded by dense particle streams and can recirculate a substantial part of these particles by return vents. This particle dispersion path in the WCAC case can be considered as \u201cteacher-vent-student\u201d to distinguish from the \u201cteacher-student-vent\u201d in the other two RRS cases. 4.2 Overall and local infection risk under recirculation mode When the speaking teacher is infected, students within the student-zone likely inhale virus-laden particles. As depicted in the previous sections, the total particles can be characterized as recirculated and uncirculated particles by dichotomy in accordance with the fate of recirculation. The recirculation modes under different RRS strategies may introduce high uncertainty into the spatio-temporal risk evolution, highlighting the necessity of quantitative assessments on not only the exposure of total virus-laden particles but also the independent contribution of these characterized particles. Fig. 9 illustrates the overall infection risk of the student-zone in continuous exposure to total and uncirculated particles under different RRS strategies. A typical lesson lasting 40 min was chosen as the exposure period. Results show that, in terms of total particles, the infection risk is generally higher than 0.01, particularly for FSAC and WCAC exceeding the controllable limit to cause a high basic reproduction number (i.e., R0 > 1). Even considering only uncirculated particles, it is still difficult to reduce the overall infection risk to <0.01 for the recirculation modes of the three RRS cases unless the lesson duration is correspondingly shortened. As an example, in the WCAC case, the infection risk can be <0.01 in the first 30 min when exposed to only uncirculated particles. The corresponding basic reproduction number is much lower than that of exposure to total particles, implying that filtration of recirculated particles could be a successful mitigation in infection control. Generally, for the observed difference in overall infection risk between total and uncirculated particles, the recirculated particles are shown to play an important role in the temporal risk accumulation of occupants in the RRS cases. Effective control of these recirculated particles can helpfully limit the presence of the \u201coutbreak potential\u201d as a high basic reproduction number and further reduce the infection risk to a low level with cooperation from other mitigation measures, such as increased air change rates and shortened exposure duration. The above infection risk was assessed for student-zone with volume-average inhaled doses accumulating during a lesson. To explain the impact of recirculation modes on the spatial distribution of infection risk and the local variability among different RRS cases more clearly, the risk contours in terms of different particles (i.e., total, uncirculated and recirculated particles) at student breathing height (z = 1.1 m) are shown in Fig. 10 . In the case of WMAC recirculation mode, the distributions are similar when referring to total and uncirculated particles, particularly the high-risk zones (>0.05, corresponding to R0 > 2 [29]), which are nearly identical. Nonetheless, the recirculated particles may only cause limited infection with evenly distributed low-risk (<0.01). Here the direct exposure to emitted particles results in a high-risk on both sides of the first row. These two zones correspond exactly to the two vortices near the first row (Fig. 7). Furthermore, the infectious particles concentrated around the lectern and doors may put high exposure on students wiping the blackboard and going out during the break. In the case of FSAC recirculation mode, the worst scenario emerges with the high-risk zones located in the middle of the student-zone. When the respiratory particles are emitted directly from the teacher, the strong airflow supplied by the FSAC is performed like an \u201cair curtain\u201d [28] that isolates the further transmission of particles to a certain extent. Due to the strong entrainment effect on the surrounding air, a vortex (Fig. 7) is developed at the student breathing height and leads to local particle accumulation with high-risk (>0.05). Then, although recirculated particles can pose a certain risk (∼0.02) along the air delivery path, as shown in Fig. 10, the majority of students still have an infection risk over a moderate level (∼0.03) while exposed to uncirculated particles, not to mention those seated in the air delivery path, even reaching a high level. Thus, the effectivity of filtration by FSAC is truly suppressed within the student-zone. In contrast to the WMAC and FSAC cases, where uncirculated particles dominate the infection risk distribution, nearly equivalent levels of infection risk are reached at the front zone of the classroom for both uncirculated and recirculated particles in the WCAC recirculation mode. This result can be explained by the particle dispersion path, which is \u201cteacher-vent-student\u201d in the WCAC case. When the mainstream of emitted particles reaches the front WCAC unit near the ceiling, a substantial part of the particles is captured by the return vent and resupplied in four directions (i.e., changed into recirculated particles), whilst the other part is influenced by the recirculation airflow with a downwards tendency (i.e., remained as uncirculated particles). Then, the multi-vortex airflow field (Fig. 7) developing around the lectern can cause a high infection risk with the accumulation of either recirculated or uncirculated particles. Although the majority of particles are limited within the front zone of the classroom by vortexes, partially recirculated particles can easily travel long distances and increase the exposure risk for back-row students. As shown by the spatial risk distribution at student breathing height, there are always students exposed to zones in high-risk, where a large number of virus-laden particles accumulate. Considering the high probability of dense particle deposition on the body and desk, the risk at breathing height may not be sufficient to capture the coverage of this high exposure. Thus, for each RRS case, we further generated an iso-surface with the same infection risk of 0.05 in terms of total particles, as shown in Fig. 11 . The red dots are chosen to indicate students influenced by the cloud envelopes. Results clearly highlight that more students are exposed to these high particle concentrations. As an example, in the case of WMAC, the airborne infection risk (Fig. 10) is relatively low for students seated near the lectern and door-sidewall, while the risk from deposited particles may be significantly high due to the close proximity to the cloud envelopes. For students that are already in high-risk zones, most are completely submerged in the cloud envelopes. For others seated out of the main high-risk coverage, differences in scattered clouds can be visually observed among the three RRS cases. Under the FSAC mode, the body and desk of these students are covered by more scattered clouds. Then, students in the FSAC case likely suffer a higher infection risk from the deposited particles than the other two RRS cases. 4.3 Rating suitability and filtration effectiveness of filters The filtering effect of air conditioning systems on virus-laden airborne particles has been the focus of mitigation measures during the COVID-19 pandemic [17]. By evaluating the capture abilities for the three particle size groups between 0.3 and 10 μm, the filters used in the air recirculation can be rated by the minimum efficiency reporting value (MERV), ranging from the lowest level MERV 1 to higher MERV 16 and even HEPA [71]. Despite the fact that higher filter ratings indicate better filtration of small particles, the actual benefits of filter upgrade in risk reduction remain confused for room-level recirculation: 1) which airborne particle size dominates the accumulation of infectious virus in the exposure? and 2) what impact factors can affect the exposure proportion of recirculated particles, given that only recirculated particles have the potential to be filtered? To determine the dominant particles, three factors of different particle sizes should be considered: emission rate [52], virus carrying capacity [72], and infection accessibility [73]. The emission rate of particle number is related to the activity level and expiratory activity (including loudness), while only the latter may change the number distribution of particle sizes. The virus carrying capacity referred to here is the viral load per respiratory particle. The viral load is simplified to be proportional to particle size [61], meaning that the larger the particle size, the stronger the virus carrying capacity. Infection accessibility was defined to represent the impact of particle spatial dispersion and boundary loss (i.e., deposition on surfaces and removal by exhaust airflow through the transom window) on particle transport from the exhalation of the infector to susceptible regions of the respiratory track. The high infectivity of the Omicron variant allows us to focus on the size-dependent particle transport on room volume, i.e., lower losses in spreading through the room for particles of a certain size would imply higher infection accessibility. The predicted particle number fraction can be an indicator of the emission rate and infection accessibility but fails to include the size effect on the virus carrying capacity [74]. Thus, in the three RRS cases, the quanta fraction of different particle sizes ( F d ) was calculated within the student-zone at 40 min by connecting the amount of virus (quanta) to each particle, which is given in the following equations: (1) F d = r d ∙ N d t ∑ k = 1 m r k ∙ N k t (2) r d = E R q ∙ V p - pre I R i ∙ C p - pre,i where N d t is the total number of suspended particles of a certain size in the specified zone; subscript k represents the kth particle size, and a total of m = 5 typical sizes of airborne particles during loud speech were discussed in this study; r d is the virus carrying capacity that is predefined in proportion to the original volume ( V p - pre ) of an exhaled particle ( quanta/particle ); and C p - pre,i is pre-evaporated volume concentration of the exhaled respiratory particles. Other parameters remain consistent with Eq. (1). Also, the quanta fractions of three groups are determined in terms of filtration efficiency: fine group (1\u20133 μm), medium group (3\u201310 μm) and coarse group (>10 μm). Results are shown in Fig. 12 . Results show that the quanta fraction within the student-zone grows with particle size for the present recirculation cases, with 16.8 μm particles occupying the most quanta in the student-zone. The same trend can also be observed for the three size groups, where the coarse group occupies quanta ranging from 69.0% to 82.0%, the medium group from 17.0% to 29.3%, and the fine group from 1.0% to 1.7%. It is clear that the larger particles contribute more to the accumulated exposure risk in the three cases. Filters such as MERV 8 seem to still be necessary and suitable in the investigated RRS environment for providing effective filtration of coarse particles (>10 μm) and capturing the majority of medium particles (3\u201310 μm). However, with an upgrade of filters from MERV 8 to MERV 13, the most important improvement in filtration efficiency is imposed on the fine group (from 20% to 90%) compared to the medium group (from 70% to 90%) [71]. Limited by the extremely low quanta fraction of either the smallest size (1 μm) or fine group, as shown in Fig. 12, the improvement in risk control of the student-zone seems to be unremarkable, which allows us the opportunity to weigh the costs and benefits of upgrading the room-level recirculation filters for generic classrooms. Detailed evaluations are required by further research work. On the other hand, the quanta fractions of a specific particle size under different RRS strategies are found to be similar, particularly for the FSAC and WCAC (the purple and blue lines in Fig. 12, respectively). These results indicate that the strong mixing effect of room-level recirculation on the indoor air and exhaled particles may reduce the difference in infection accessibility of the five particle sizes. Consequently, the emission rate and virus carrying capacity become more important in the formation of the dominant particle size. Capturing the state of the infector, such as the expiratory activities of breathing and speaking, can be helpful for an accurate risk assessment of the room-level recirculation mode. The above analysis aims to answer the first question about the dominant particle sizes, highlighting the importance of understanding the rating suitability of recirculation filters for flexible risk control. However, given that the exposure zone is rarely occupied by only recirculated particles [16], the filters cannot completely remove the virus-laden particles from the exposure zone (where the infection source is always present), even with 100% filtration efficiency for all particle sizes. Such recognition can be a representation of the effectiveness of room-level recirculation filters (ERRF). During the COVID-19 epidemic, the application of filters is of concern as an energy-saving mitigation measure, where a higher ERRF always leads to a greater contribution of filters to particle removal [75], allowing a reasonable reduction in the requirements of typical mitigation measures (e.g., increased air change rate) for less energy consumption. Nevertheless, besides of the pre-designed filtration rating, the ERRF becomes complex under the impact of operating factors that include the time, system type, particle size, etc. [75]. Due to the benefits of the marking method that distinguishes the recirculated and uncirculated particles from the total particles, the complete information of the ERRF can be easily obtained from the virus (quanta) share of either type of particles relative to the total particles, including each size and entire multi sizes. The higher quanta share of recirculated particles means that more virus have the potential to be removed by filtration. Thus, we herein focused on the impacts of these operating factors on ERRF through the analysis of the quanta recirculation share of the airborne particles. As shown by Fig. 13 , the share of quanta by recirculation fates in each size (1 µm, 1.9 µm, 5 µm, 9.8 µm, 16.8 µm) of airborne particles within the student-zone were displayed for three RRS cases (WMAC, FSAC, WCAC) at different time points (10 min, 25 min, 40 min). The impact of the exposure time on the ERRF can be found from the evolution of quanta share at three time points of 10 min, 25 min and 40 min. There is a general increasing trend for the quanta share of recirculated particles. This is likely related to the increasing particle concentration in the recirculation airflow, which is supplied by room units in efficient modes of thermal comfort (e.g., the upper supply vanes at an angle of 45°) and has a strong direct impact on the exposure characteristic of the student-zone [28] . Thus, it is not surprising that the increase between the last two time points is less than that between the first two time points due to the temporal dispersion and accumulation of particles with gradual convergence to a steady state. Considering the temporal evolution found here, attention should be paid to the start-up phase of virus exposure, at which time the particles emitted into the room are still not much and the probability of particles recirculating through the return vents is relatively low. The ERRF may be limited during the start-up phase, and this could cause the potential risk overrating the effect of the recirculation filters in other short-stay scenarios (e.g., a 10-min meeting). The impact of the RRS type on the ERRF is significant by comparing the WMAC, FSAC and WCAC cases. The quanta share of recirculated particles is consistently above 50% for the WCAC case, indicating a relatively high level compared to the WMAC and FSAC cases that remain below 30%. Due to the different paths of particle dispersion, as already displayed in Fig. 8, there is a lagging phenomenon in both the recirculation modes of WMAC and FSAC, making it difficult for the units to effectively incorporate exhaled particles into the recirculation airflow before they reach the student-zone. In contrast, a large portion of exhaled particles is quickly transformed into recirculated particles by the front WCAC unit and then develops a large dispersion following the four-way supplied airflow towards the student-zone. It should be noted that the ERRF cannot directly represent the effect of risk control, as shown in Fig. 9, the overall infection risk of uncirculated particles is markedly different between the WMAC and FSAC cases, with the former being nearly one-half of the latter and nearly decreasing to the low infection risk of 0.01. Despite this uncertainty in low ERRF, the results of the WMAC case indicate that the RRS type with high ERRF can still provide effective risk control if the filtration efficiency is adequate. The impact of the particle size on the ERRF is found to follow the general increasing trend of the ERRF as the particle size decreases. For the WMAC case at 40 min, the quanta share of recirculated particles is 14.9% for the largest size (16.8 μm) and up to 65.3% for the smallest size (1 μm). These results may relate to the gravitational force [13] acting on particles of different sizes, and smaller particles are more likely to disperse with airflow and be received by the return vents of room units. In the WCAC case, it should be noted that the infected teacher is within the zone strongly influenced by supplied airflow. As a direct consequence of this, particles of five sizes are forced to move along the airflow and quickly enter the recirculation through the front WCAC unit. The difference in the quanta recirculation share between a single small size and entire multi sizes also need to be explained for the case of WMAC and FSAC. Although smaller particles have a higher share of quanta when recirculated (over 50%), larger particles that dominate the total amount of quanta were not recirculated as much (14.9% ∼ 24.1%), resulting in recirculated particles having a limited quanta share of about 20% in terms of the entire multi sizes. Thus, when smaller particles play the dominant role in the quanta accumulation (e.g., only breathing activity considered), the difference in the quanta share between a single small size and the entire multi sizes is expected to be smaller, leading to a higher ERRF. 5 Conclusions and suggestions Understanding airborne transmission in indoor environments designed with room-level air recirculation systems (RRSs) is of critical importance to infection control for COVID-19. In this study, a simulation procedure was proposed to assess the performance of RRSs on infection control and the benefit-cost of recirculation filters, beginning with the physical model of indoor scenarios of interest and the relevant setup of the numerical model. The real multi-scale particle recirculation is then considered during the iteration, followed by the results of the infection risk and particle size distribution within the breathing zone. A poorly ventilated winter classroom was selected as a typical case of RRS to operate this procedure. Three RRS strategies (i.e., WMAC, FSAC and WCAC) were evaluated, and the main conclusions of this study are as follows: (1) The real particle simulation with the Eulerian\u2013Lagrangian solver can capture the characteristics of respiratory particle dispersion in the recirculation airflow field, such as the different dispersion paths of \u201cteacher-student-vent\u201d (WMAC and FSAC cases) and \u201cteacher-vent-student\u201d (WCAC case) in the studied scenarios. (2) A dichotomy of the total particles in the computational zone is beneficial to quantitatively assess the risk contributions of recirculated and uncirculated particles. For a poorly ventilated classroom equipped with RRS, recirculated particles in recirculation mode play an important role in accumulating the overall infection risk of students, and the lack of effective restrictions on them may lead to the presence of \u201coutbreak potential\u201d. In the case of WMAC and FSAC, the recirculated particles contribute less to the high-risk (>0.05); in other words, controls on the recirculated particles may not be efficient at reducing their local high exposure. (3) The correlation between the distribution of high-risk zones and large vortexes is highlighted under the air recirculation mode in terms of the breathing height of susceptible occupants (i.e., students). For example, the case of FSAC fully developed a large vortex in the middle of students, posing a significant infection risk to them. (4) Based on the size distribution of virus-laden particles in the breathing zone, the optimization of recirculation filters can be suggested by rating suitability and filtration effectiveness to balance the infection risk and energy cost. The former relates to the quanta fraction of dominant particle size, where MERV 8 have chance to be useful. The latter can be easily obtained from the quanta recirculation share, which presents low or high values for different operating factors. Although RRSs have been widely used as air conditioning systems for indoor environments, there are still few related recommendations of infection control for room-level recirculation. The proposed procedure provides a practical assessment of the airborne risk of rooms designed with RRSs and supports the recommendations of infection control. For example, in the studied classroom cases, filters rated at least MERV 8 are still recommended for room units. The local high-risk, if necessary, also needs specific control, such as the application of stand-alone air cleaners. Finally, opening the windows and doors between each lesson is necessary to avoid continuous exposure. This is because recirculation filters have relatively low effectiveness on larger airborne particles that contribute dominantly to exposure while the teacher is infected. However, given that the infection risk in students during a single lesson can still be too high under poor ventilation, the infection control of using intermittent ventilation strategy with full ventilation only during breaks may be limited. The present research work has several limitations. First, the infection risk was simulated under certain boundary conditions, including the room unit position, the recirculation airflow rate, the breathing mode, the less ventilated window and the motionless infected teacher. Although these boundary conditions attempted to keep close to the general classroom scenario, the realistic environment can be more diverse and complex. Second, the effect of mitigation measures, such as vaccination and face masks, was also not considered. Third, the complex flow of virus-laden particles within the room units was neglected, but the internal structure and environment may be important for physical deposition and viral inactivation and need to be investigated in a full-scale experiment in future research.

        "dc:description": "The emergence of viral variants has driven a continuous pandemic with a higher possibility of airborne transmission and a larger scale of infective cases, posing greater demands on indoor risk control. However, the role of room-level air recirculation systems (RRSs) in infection control remains unclear due to insufficient detailed research. There are also fewer analyses of the filtering rating of recirculation filters from the perspective of multi-scale particle size. Thus, a simulation procedure to assess the performance of RRSs on infection control that accounts the transient recirculation of real virus-laden particles in multi-scale sizes was proposed, and focusing on recirculation filter strategies to balance the risk limitation and energy cost. A poorly ventilated winter classroom was selected as a typical environment equipped with RRSs to operate this procedure. Different RRS strategies (i.e., wall-mounted air conditioners (WMAC), floor-standing air conditioners (FSAC) and 4-way cassette air conditioners (WCAC)) were compared. The results show the important contribution of recirculated particles to accumulating the overall infection risk of susceptible occupants towards a high basic reproduction number (Ro > 1). Then, there is a strong correlation of the spatial distributions between high-risk zones and large vortexes at the breathing height of susceptible occupants. Considering rating suitability and filtration effectiveness, the optimization of recirculation filters on energy and cost can be suggested with comparable benefits of infection control.",
