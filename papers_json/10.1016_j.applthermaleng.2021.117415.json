In commercial buildings, building mechanical systems use over 33\u201350% of the total building energy consumption. As an energy conservation measure, an economizer can be used to reduce energy consumption and operating costs by introducing cold outdoor air into building space based on the outside air temperature or enthalpy. Among control types of economizer, enthalpy-based control is the more energy-efficient approach for the economizer cycle in Korea. However, in reality, humidity sensors are often out of order in buildings, which disables enthalpy-based controls in economizers. Therefore, as a practical substitute, multi-variable temperature-based control was investigated in this study using the local outdoor air humidity to consider latent loads in the typical temperature-based control and supplement the frequent failures of humidity sensors. The results showed the substantial energy savings potential in temperature-based control, which is driven by reduced system loads in cooling coils in a mixed-humid climate. Also, an analysis of the psychrometric charts represented that the impact of multi-variable temperature-based control would be more significant in humid climates than dry or marine regions. The proposed approach can complement the conventional differential dry-bulb temperature control method and provide a guide for improved economizer operations to achieve better energy performance in hot and humid climates.

Energy consumption has steadily increased in building constructions and operations driven by global population and economic growth [2]. What is especially noteworthy in commercial buildings is that building systems (i.e., HVAC, lighting) accounted for over 33\u201350% of the building energy consumption [3\u20135]. This fact implies that building energy consumption and system efficiency has become a global issue in building energy policies to eliminate unnecessary energy waste and greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs). Thereby, energy conservation measures can be effectively used to reduce the energy consumption of building system design and control methods in new constructions or existing buildings [6]. Currently, numerous energy conservation measures have been developed and evaluated for building systems by researchers. For example, duty cycling can intermittently stop the air conditioning systems while maintaining a thermally comfortable environment in buildings [7]. Heating setback and cooling setup strategies [8] are also attractive means of energy conservation in HVAC system controls, which allows reducing system operation cost and energy consumption during unoccupied hours without the additional budget investment. Also, the optimum start of HVAC systems shortens unnecessary pre-cooling and pre-heating hours, and the optimum stop prevents heating and cooling energy waste when the buildings are unoccupied. Lastly, night purge saves building energy consumption by introducing outdoor air into the building spaces during the unoccupied hours at night to chill the building mass before the beginning of the occupied hours [9\u201311]. These measures showed significant advances in system controls for more energy savings. However, among many energy-saving measures, the economizer is an effective system in modern buildings. Typically, an economizer in air-handling units (AHUs) can reduce or eliminate mechanical cooling loads at the specific outside air conditions [12]. In detail, the economizer reduces cooling energy use and operating cost using cold outdoor air when the outside air temperature or enthalpy is lower than the return air temperature or enthalpy in buildings. For control methods, Standard 90.1\u20132019 [13] described four types of high-limit shut-off controls with high-limit setpoint settings for air-side economizers based on the climate zones, including fixed dry-bulb temperature, differential dry-bulb temperature, fixed enthalpy with fixed dry-bulb temperature, and differential enthalpy with fixed dry-bulb temperature. High-limit control sets back outdoor air fraction to minimum rate or shuts off economizers when high-limit variables exceed or fail to reach thresholds on the psychrometric charts. By controlling outdoor air fraction, economizers can ensure energy efficiency in HVAC systems. The effectiveness of economizers has also been verified in several previous studies [14\u201318]. The impact of economizer operation in commercial buildings would vary depending on the system control types. In the previous literature, Yao and Wang [19] identified the impact of temperature-based and enthalpy-based economizer controls on variable air volume (VAV) systems. This study estimated the energy-saving ratio using a simulation program in six climate zones in China. The results of this study found that the economizer cycle in the hot-humid summer climate zones reduced approximately 10\u201320% of energy compared to the cool-dry summer zone. In another study about economizer control strategies, Chowdhury and Khan [20] analyzed the predicted chiller energy use with measured data using EnergyPlus over five working days. In the simulation result, the economizer controls saved 72 kW/m2∙month in cooling loads compared to the existing building. Also, between economizer control methods, enthalpy-based economizer control is typically regarded as a more effective method in hot and humid climates (e.g., Korea). Son et al. [21] verified that the differential enthalpy (DE) control was the most effective approach to reducing cooling energy in Korea's weather conditions, which showed approximately 10% more savings than other control types. In this study, the differential dry-bulb temperature control consumed 12.7% lower cooling energy than the no economizer method during the transition periods (e.g., spring, fall). However, in summer, it used 7.1% more cooling energy in the hot-humid climate. In AHUs, the cooling coil eliminates both sensible and latent loads at the wet coil conditions if the outdoor air condition is humid. In contrast, the cooling coil only controls the sensible loads if the outdoor air condition is dry [22]. In this case, dehumidification is not required because the outside air condition is dry [12]. Previous studies [14\u201318,21] showed that an economizer is a useful measure to improve cooling energy savings potential for HVAC systems. In the process of economizer operations, indoor and outdoor environmental information is required from sensors in HVAC systems to determine outside air fraction for free-cooling or minimizing mechanical cooling using chilled outside air in AHUs. Therefore, ANSI/ASHRAE/IES Standard 90.1\u20132019 [13] defines the sensor accuracy of the dry bulb and wet bulb temperature that has to be equal to or less ± 1.1℃ over the range of 4.4℃ to 26.7℃, and the sensor accuracy of relative humidity (RH) has to be similar to or less ± 5% over the range of 20% to 80% RH. However, the HVAC system sensors are often out of order, which needs some periodic maintenance to keep the sensors operating correctly [23]. In the field study of this research, the facility managers of the case study building responded that the humidity sensor is frequently broken, and thus it is not stable to control economizer systems for HVAC systems. In a previous study, Kim et al. [24] revealed that economizer control is vulnerable to sensor errors for operations in HVAC systems. The study showed that all examined economizer controls are sensitive to sensor errors. Flawed information from sensor errors may lead to wrong control decisions for economizer controls. Also, it may reduce the potential energy savings that can give rise to higher peak loads on the system coils [25]. Therefore, Seem and House [26] showed that sensor errors in economizer control inflated 3.0%-40.3% of the annual coil loads on the coils compared to ideal economizer operation modes without sensor errors. In another study, Zhang et al. [27] compared three modeling approaches of economizer (i.e., input data file modification, energy management system module, and newly developed fault object) in EnergyPlus to evaluate the impact of economizer sensor errors and zone thermostat errors in the aspect of the energy consumption and thermal comfort. Since the economizer typically requires two types of air properties (i.e., dry-bulb temperature and humidity) to calculate the enthalpy, the significant errors in sensors cause considerably inaccurate enthalpy calculations for economizer operations. Besides, this study pointed out that because the humidity sensor tends to break down in actual monitoring easily, it is sometimes a challenge to use the enthalpy-based control in buildings. If the system control is performed with the wrong information from the humidity sensors, cooling systems would highly waste cooling energy in the building [24,28]. The economizer operation through the humidity sensors is often unrealistic in practice, which requires frequent recalibration of sensors [29]. Therefore, to overcome sensor failures in HVAC systems, a new solution is indispensable for economizers. As an alternative approach, Yao and Wang [19] argued that the implementation of temperature-based economizer control is more straightforward and convenient than that of an enthalpy-based economizer in the actual situation. Also, in the analysis of the intrinsic errors of economizer high-limit control strategies, Taylor and Cheng [30] suggested fixed dry-bulb temperature controls to minimize sensor errors in economizer operations with low initial costs and maintenance costs as high-limit control strategies for U.S. climate zones. Although the temperature-based control would increase the latent loads in cooling systems compared to the enthalpy-based control due to the ingress of unintended humidity, a study of temperature-based control is imperative to deal with the frequent failures of the humidity sensors in HVAC systems. However, previous studies have been neglected the research of supplementary measures for the temperature-based control\u2019s latent load calculations. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate the multi-variable differential dry-bulb temperature (DT) control. Currently, latent loads are not sufficiently considered in the typical temperature-based method. In this study, the multi-variable DT approach was proposed using outdoor humidity data from a public source (e.g., Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) [31]) to complement typical DT economizer controls for the places where humidity sensors are not installed or fail to sense air humidity in buildings. Relative humidity and humidity ratio were used as high limits of the multi-variable DT controls in humid climates. The multi-variable DT control provides an insight into the conventional DT methods to include latent load estimations, which is also expected to reduce the gap between the enthalpy-based control and the temperature-based control in hot and humid climates. To achieve the research goals, this study analyzed air handling unit (AHU) data for one year from patient rooms in a large hospital building in Seoul, Korea. Then, the outdoor air fractions of the DT control and the DE control were calculated to compare economizer operations with the actual building. Based on the calculations of outdoor air fraction, the system loads on cooling coils were estimated in the DT control and the DE control and then compared with the cooling coil loads of the actual data. Lastly, the multi-variable high-limit DT controls were developed using outdoor air humidity to complement the conventional DT control and to calculate the savings potential of the system loads in cooling coils. The multi-variable methods were proposed as adjusted high-limit shut-off strategies based on the typical DT control using relative humidity and/or humidity ratio from the national weather service. The outcomes of this study will provide an alternative solution for various sensor failures in economizer operations and help engineers who want to seek advanced HVAC system control options for economizers. 2 Case study building and data collection This study aims to explore the multi-variable differential temperature (DT) controls in economizer using outdoor air humidity as an alternative control method to supplement the typical enthalpy-based (DE) control when humidity sensor errors occur during HVAC operations. To improve the DT controls, a case study building was selected in Seoul, Korea, to evaluate the impact of the multi-variable DT controls based on the field study data. The case study building is a large hospital with fifteen stories and six basement floors. The total building area is about 105,800 m2, and the building height is about 80 m. This study selected one of the AHUs (i.e., AHU 1) of the patient rooms in the hospital. Table 1 describes the space characteristics of patient rooms in the case study building. In this study, the actual building's outdoor air fractions were analyzed to compare with other economizer control types (i.e., DT, DE) to diagnose the difference in operating modes. The multi-variable high-limit DT controls were developed to improve the typical DT controls using outdoor air humidity data. Then, the collected data were used to calculate the system cooling loads using the various economizer control types (i.e., DT, DE, multi-variable DT). The results showed the estimated potential energy savings for the hospital in Korea using multi-variable economizer control types in order to develop a suitable operation method for economizers. Fig. 1 represents a south view of the case study building and a schematic diagram of the air-handling unit (AHU) of patient rooms. Table 2 shows sensor information mounted in the AHU [32]. In the case study building, facility managers can monitor and collect HVAC operation data through sensors in AHUs, including indoor and outdoor air temperatures (i.e., supply air temperature, return air temperature, outdoor air temperature, mixed air temperature), relative humidity (i.e., supply air humidity, return air humidity, outdoor air humidity), and air volumes (i.e., supply air volume, return air volume). The building automation system (BAS) provides the ability to collect a large amount of near-real data and responds to the individual zone\u2019s thermal requirements. Therefore, this study collected BAS data from the case building and used system data at 1-hour intervals for one year from December 2015 to November 2016. Fig. 2 shows the research process to evaluate multi-variable temperature-based controls in this study. In this study, firstly, the performance of three economizer controls was compared in system cooling coil loads, which include original building control, typical differential temperature (DT) control, and typical DE control. Then, three types of multi-variable high-limit controls were proposed using relative humidity (e.g., RH 50\u201380%), humidity ratio (e.g., 0.013\u20130.018 kg/kg), and combinations of relative humidity and humidity ratio from the public weather service. For data pre-processing, collected data from patient rooms were reviewed to detect missing data and errors, and two missing days (Dec/28 2015, Jan/9/2016) were excluded in calculations. Outdoor air (OA) fraction and system cooling loads in AHUs were calculated to compare original hospital economizer control and typical DT control and typical DE control for diagnosis. A minimum outdoor air rate of AHUs was fixed at 30% for operations based on the related standards. Finally, the impact of multi-variable high-limit controls was calculated to supplement typical DT controls, which include latent load calculations using outdoor air humidity. Fig. 3 depicts outdoor air, supply air, and return air temperatures from HVAC systems in the case study building. During the monitoring period, the return air temperature (RA Temp) showed a constant indoor setpoint temperature at about 26℃, regardless of the seasonal changes. The supply air temperature was lower than the return air temperature from April to November, and the lowest supply air temperature (SA Temp) was 18.9℃ in July. In contrast, in winter, the daily supply air temperature was 1.5℃ higher than the daily return air temperature. The highest supply air temperature was 31.7℃ in January. The lowest daily outdoor temperature (OA Temp) was about −5.6℃ in winter, and the highest daily outdoor temperature was about 31.5℃ in summer. The distribution of outdoor air humidity (OA RH) was generally higher in summer than in other seasons (i.e., spring, fall, winter). Also, relative humidity in fall was more elevated than in spring. 3 Typical DT and DE controls using monitored data from a case study building 3.1 Outdoor air fraction by economizer control types An economizer introduces cold outside air into AHUs to reduce the cooling energy consumption as a part of the cooling and ventilation system. The ratio of outside air varies depending on the control types, the purpose of outside air inflow, and climate conditions. Therefore, the determination of outdoor air fraction is significant to identify the impact of the economizer control type on building cooling loads. The outdoor air fraction can be determined by the relationship between the temperature or enthalpy of the outside air and the temperature or enthalpy of the supply air. For this, the outdoor air fraction was computed for the actual building based on monitored outside air, return air, and mixed air temperature data. Also, two equations were used to calculate the outdoor air fractions in the typical DT and DE controls: equations (1) and (2). Equation (1) allows estimating outdoor air fraction for the typical temperature-based economizer control based on the supply air temperature of the AHU. Also, equation (2) was used to compute outdoor air fraction for the typical enthalpy-based economizer mode based on supply air enthalpy. This is important because the system cooling loads are calculated according to the outdoor air fraction determined by the control type. The minimum outdoor air fraction for the case study building was set to 30% in compliance with the related standards [33,34]. On psychrometric charts, when the outside air temperature or enthalpy is lower than the supply air temperature or enthalpy, the outdoor air fraction can be calculated using Equation (1) or (2) based on the economizer control type. On the contrary, if the outside air temperature or enthalpy was larger than the supply air temperature or enthalpy as well as less than the return air temperature or enthalpy on the psychrometric charts, outdoor air fraction will be 100% for economizer controls. Lastly, if the outside air temperature or enthalpy is greater than the return air temperature or enthalpy, the minimum outside air entrance ratio should be 30% for economizer controls. (1) OAF = T RA - T SA T RA - T OA Where OAF = outdoor air fraction, TRA = return air temperature, TSA = supply air temperature, and TOA = outdoor air temperature. (2) OAF = h RA - h SA h RA - h OA Where OAF = outdoor air fraction, hRA = return air enthalpy [kJ/kg], hSA = supply air enthalpy [kJ/kg], hOA = outdoor air enthalpy [kJ/kg]. Fig. 4 compared the outdoor air fractions by economizer control type throughout the year. When it comes to the outdoor air fraction in winter, the outdoor air fraction mostly maintained a minimum outside air fraction of 30% except when the outdoor air temperature was about 20℃ or higher during the day. The case study building used temperature-based economizer control without humidity controls. The outdoor air fraction of the actual building was substantially higher than that of the DE control across spring to fall. In the DT control, the outdoor air fraction was similar to the actual operation in spring and higher in summer (i.e., June). Also, the outdoor air fraction of the DT control was higher compared to the DE control except for the period of April 20th to May 10th. Contrastively, in spring, the DE control pattern was mostly lower than the actual operation except at the end of April to early May. In summer, the outdoor air fraction of the DE control was a minimum rate in July and August due to hot-humid weather conditions, making a substantial difference between the actual operation and the DE control. In the fall, the case study building required more outdoor air, especially in September. The results of the outdoor air fraction showed that the case study building has significant energy savings potential for system loads in cooling coils when applying the optimized economizer controls. 3.2 Comparison of system loads in cooling coils by the economizer control type In buildings, economizers operate in HVAC systems by introducing fresh and cold outdoor air into AHUs, which mitigates cooling loads in summer and transition seasons. Therefore, this section verified the total load differences by economizer control type in the case study building. The climate in Seoul, Korea, is classified as 4A in ASHRAE Standard 90.1\u20132019 [13]. \u201c4A\u201d in the classification represents that the typical characteristic of the climate is \u201chumid\u201d. In detail, in spring and fall, the total cooling hours less than RH 50% were 331 hrs (34.3%), and in summer, the total cooling hours smaller than RH 50% accounted for 10.0% (177 hrs) of total cooling hours. This indicates that in Korea, the wet climate conditions are more dominant throughout spring to fall. s In this study, system loads in cooling coils were calculated based on the outdoor air fraction for economizer controls throughout the year. In general, free cooling is mostly available in economizers during spring and fall periods using cold outdoor air temperature. Depending on the amount of the outdoor air fraction, the amount of the mixed air temperature and enthalpy varies. This study used equation (3) to calculate the system loads in cooling coils for each control type. When considering the humidity in the air, system cooling loads can be calculated using the difference between the mixed air enthalpy (MAE) and the supply air enthalpy (SAE) on the psychrometric charts as equation (3) [32]. (3) S y s t e m l o a d k W = ρ × Q × ( M A h - S A h ) Ã · 3600 Where ρ = air density [kg/m3], Q = air flow rate [m3/h], M A h = mixed air enthalpy [kJ/kg], and S A h = supply air enthalpy [kJ/kg]. Fig. 5 and Table 3 compared monthly system cooling loads in coils by economizer control type with the actual building\u2019s operating results throughout the year from December 2015 to November 2016 in the case study building. The monthly load patterns in Fig. 5 showed that the actual building used excessive cooling loads in coils across the year. Also, the DE control used fewer cooling loads than the actual building and the DT control all year round, especially from June to September. This result indicates that enthalpy-based control is more suitable than temperature-based control under weather conditions in Korea. Therefore, the research attempted to cut down the gap on system cooling loads between the DT and the DE controls using multi-variable DT controls. The multi-variable DT controls were proposed to consider latent load calculations in the conventional DT control using outdoor air humidity. In the results of system loads in cooling coils, the case study building used 232.1 MW/yr in AHU 1. This cooling load was 22.3 MW/yr more than the estimated DT control and 52.4 MW/yr more than the estimated DE control. As an economizer control approach, the DT control showed 9.6% of savings potential in cooling loads, and the DE control represented 22.6% of savings potential in the same period. Also, the annual difference in system cooling loads between the DT control and the DE control was 30.1 MW/yr. The DE control showed better performance of cooling load savings potential, which revealed about 16.7% better efficiency than the DT control. 4 Potential energy savings of Multi-Variable DT control methods In this section, this study evaluated the system load savings potential in cooling coils using multi-variable DT controls to improve the economizer\u2019s energy performance in the typical DT controls. The multi-variable DT controls were developed as modifications based on the typical DT control methods in order to consider the latent loads using outdoor humidity (i.e., relative humidity and humidity ratio). This approach is expected to reduce the gap in cooling load savings potential between the DT and the DE controls. 4.1 Multi-Variable DT control methods using outdoor air humidity The thermal environment in the building is sensitive to changes in the outdoor climate and surrounding environment. The weather characteristics can appear variously on the psychrometric charts depending on the climates where the building is located. Therefore, for economizer controls, appropriate DT models should be selected considering climate and evaluated to reduce system cooling loads effectively. Therefore, this study developed the multi-variable DT controls to improve the economizer\u2019s control method in the case building. Fig. 6 summarizes an analysis procedure of the multi-variable DT controls on the psychrometric charts. On the psychrometric chart, this study targeted a yellow-colored area of the original DT control to enhance energy performance where the outside air temperature is between return air temperature (TRA) and supply air temperature (TSA). In this temperature zone, the HVAC system opens 100% of the outdoor air damper for the energy-saving mode to minimize mechanical cooling loads in coils. The DT control can be an effective method for cooling load-saving where temperature zones are laid on low external humidity. However, in temperature zones with high-humidity outdoor air, the DT control may increase system cooling loads due to no considerations of the latent loads. Therefore, when considering high enthalpy in the yellow-colored zone, the minimum outdoor air fraction would be more energy-conservative to operate economizer systems. Therefore, this study proposed multi-variable DT models that consider latent load calculations using the outdoor air humidity in the traditional DT control models. The multi-variable DT models were developed as modifications using outdoor humidity based on the original DT control. Since this study assumed the cases when humidity sensors are out of order in AHUs, hourly humidity data were gathered from the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) (i.e., Seoul: Station #108). The controlled zones by the proposed DT models were made in red-colored zones on the psychrometric charts in Fig. 6, which refers to high-limit controlled areas using 50\u201380% of relative humidity (RH) and 0.013\u20130.018 kg/kg of humidity ratio (HR). In red-colored zones, the multi-variable DT controls operated the minimum outdoor damper ratio (i.e., 30%) instead of the 100% outdoor air fraction of the typical DT control. In other words, under the multi-variable models, the economizer converted the operation mode of outside air inflow from 100% to 30% at the minimum rate using the outdoor air damper when the outdoor air humidity satisfies above a specific humidity level (i.e., RH and HR). To verify the impact of the multi-variable DT models, this study subdivided high limits of the outdoor humidity (i.e., RH and HR) to create several multi-variable DT models for energy performance evaluation. In steps 1 and 2, RH and HR were individually used as high limits of the DT control. The variation of RH for high-limit controls was from 50% to 80%, and the variation of HR was from 0.013 to 0.018 kg/kg. In step 3, the integrated high limits of the multi-variable controls were evaluated that combined multiple cases of 50\u201380% RH and 0.013\u20130.018 kg/kg HR for the multi-variable DT analysis. 4.2 Energy savings potential of Multi-Variable DT controls using relative humidity and humidity ratio In this section, the energy savings potential of the multi-variable DT control methods was evaluated to quantify the impact of the multi-variable high-limit DT controls on system cooling loads and to reduce the gap between the typical DT control and the DE control. Table 4 represents the system cooling coil loads operated through the AHU 1 in the case study building. The estimated cooling coil loads represent the cases of the typical DT and DE controls and the cases of the multi-variable DT controls that applied the minimum outdoor air fraction when outdoor humidity is equal to or exceeds a specific relative humidity (RH) or humidity ratio (HR). 50\u201380% of relative humidity and 0.013\u20130.018 kg/kg of humidity ratio were used as high limits for the multi-variable DT controls in economizer systems. Fig. 7 showed the summarized results of the RH and HR-based multi-variable DT controls with the change points. The change points represent the largest energy-savings potential of each multi-variable DT approach. First, the multi-variable DT controls considering relative humidity were used to evaluate the impact on system cooling loads in the case study building. Test cases of relative humidity were named 50% or higher (DT-RH50), 60% or higher (DT-RH60), 70% or higher (DT-RH70), and 80% or higher (DT-RH80), respectively, depending on relative humidity levels. In Table 4, the results of the AHU 1 showed 232.1 MW/yr of the actual system cooling coil loads, 209.8 MW/yr of the DT control, and 179.8 MW/yr of the DE control. In the RH multi-variable DT controls, the DT-RH60 showed the highest energy savings potential. The case operated the minimum outside air ratio when relative humidity was equal to or more than 60%. This model represented about 200.6 MW/yr of the system cooling loads, which was equivalent to 9.1 MW/yr or a 4.4% reduction compared to the existing DT control. In contrast, the DT-RH80 produced the lowest system cooling load savings potential. The model set back to 30% of the minimum outside air ratio when relative humidity is above 80%. The DT-RH80 used 201.0 MW/yr of the annual cooling loads, which was equivalent to 8.8 MW/yr or 4.2% of cooling load savings versus the typical DT control. In varying relative humidity, the DT-RH60 was a change point of the system cooling load trend. The impact on system cooling loads decreased before and after the DT-RH60. The DT-RH50 method represented 201.7 MW/yr of the annual cooling loads and 3.9% cooling load savings versus the typical DT control. Table 5 showed the system cooling loads in cases that the multi-variable DT controls used changing humidity ratio to compare the impact on annual cooling loads in coils against the existing DT control. When the humidity ratio was 0.014 kg/kg, the case showed the largest load savings potential of the humidity ratio (HR) based on multi-variable DT controls. The cooling loads were 199.9 MW/yr, and the potential cooling load saving was 4.8% compared to the conventional DT operation. The HR-based models showed an increasing trend of cooling load savings potential when approaching HR 0.014. When comparing the results of Tables 4 and 5, the HR-based multi-variable DT models described approximately 0.4% more cooling load savings than the RH-based multi-variable DT models. 4.3 Energy savings potential of Multi-Variable DT controls in combinations with relative humidity and humidity ratio In Sections 4.1 and 4.2, the multi-variable DT controls were evaluated using high limits of relative humidity and humidity ratio. This section developed the combined high limits for the multi-variable high-limit DT controls to identify the impact on cooling loads and the most suitable approaches for system load savings in the case study building. Table 6 represents the estimated system cooling loads and savings potential in the multi-variable DT controls, considering relative humidity and humidity ratio simultaneously in the case study building. In the table, the actual cooling coil load was 232.1 MW/yr and the typical DT control was 209.8 MW/yr. The cooling coil loads of the RH-HR combined multi-variable DT controls were 199.9 MW/yr to 202.9 MW/yr. Among all RA-HR combination cases, the largest system cooling load savings were found in combinations between HR 0.014 (kg/kg) and RH50%-70% and a combination between HR 0.016 (kg/kg) and RH80%. The most effective combinations were RH50-60% models with 0.014 (kg/kg) humidity ratio, which saved more than 4.8% cooling loads than the typical DT control, as shown in Fig. 8 . However, humidity lines of RH 50\u201360% are placed below the HR 0.013 line on psychrometric charts where the outside air temperature is 20\u201326 °C. Such a fact represents that the HR-based control dominates cooling load savings in the zone under RH70%, and the multi-variable DT controls had less effect on the low relative humidity models below RH 70% (i.e., RH 50%, 60%). In other words, the combined high limits of the multi-variable DT controls are more effective with high RH models (i.e., RH 70% or above relative humidity), and the HR-based control can be recommended for under RH70% weather conditions. In Table 6 and Fig. 8, the change points to identify the maximum load savings were found in combinations of HR 0.014 kg/kg and the DT-RH50-70% and a combination of HR 0.016 kg/kg and the DT-RH80. The cooling loads showed increased trends before and after the change points of the combinations. The saving ratios of the combined multi-variable DT controls were 3.3\u20134.8% compared to the typical DT controls. In an overview of the results, the combined multi-variable DT controls represented better energy performance than the RH-based DT controls and a similar impact on cooling load savings with the HR-based DT controls. The results of the RH-HR combinations based on outdoor weather data (i.e., station 108) from the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) verified that the combined multi-variable approaches are fairly effective versus the typical DT control to reduce the gap between the DT control and the DE control. 5 Discussion This study aimed to develop an alternative model to supplement the current DE control methods using the multi-variable high-limit DT controls. This study analyzed the cooling load-savings potential of the multi-variable DT controls based on the actual operation data of the case study building and suggested improved DT economizer control methods to supplement the humidity sensor failures in HVAC systems. Since the typical enthalpy-based controls cannot be operated in the fields if the humidity sensors are broken, or the humidity sensors are not installed in the HVAC systems, the multi-variable DT control methods were proposed to replace the enthalpy-based controls with consideration of latent load calculations. To achieve the goals, this study used outdoor air humidity data from the Korea Meteorological Administration to reflect latent loads in the modified DT controls as an alternative approach to the enthalpy-based control. The multi-variable high-limit DT controls can make up for the failures of humidity data sensing in the HVAC systems for economizer controls. The results showed that the proposed multi-variable DT methods saved up to 4.8% of system cooling loads compared to the typical DT controls. The uncertainty ratios of energy savings on system cooling coil loads were 0.51% of the DT-HR controls, and 1.07\u20131.44% of the DT-HR and DT-RH + HR controls compared to typical DT methods. This study verified the possibility of the modified DT models using multi-variable high-limits to reduce cooling loads in HVAC systems in a hot-humid climate in Korea. The results of this study can contribute to developing energy conservation measures of the system cooling loads not only in the climate of Korea but also in hot and humid zones. However, the impact of the multi-variable DT controls would differ depending on climate zone and regional weather conditions. In the economizer cycle, the differential temperature (DT) control requires outdoor air temperature to determine outdoor air fraction for free cooling and ventilation in buildings. Therefore, this chapter compared annual total hours and total enthalpy in controlled zones by the multi-variable DT models. The representative cities of each climate zone were selected based on ASHRAE climate classification, including hot to cold and dry to marine weather conditions [35,36]. In Fig. 9 , one-year weather data of climate zone 2A (hot-humid) to 4C (Mixed-marine) in the U.S. are presented on psychrometric charts. Climate zones 2\u20134 refer to hot, warm, and mixed climate regions, respectively, and symbols A to C refer to humid, dry, and marine regions. Red boxes on psychrometric charts represent the controlled zones by the multi-variable DT controls, which were defined by 20\u201326 °C and HR 0.013\u20130.018 kg/kg. In the conventional DT control, these zones are assumed as 100% outdoor air fraction. However, this study suggested the minimum outdoor air fraction (i.e., 30%) for these zones based on the multi-variable DT controls using outdoor humidity from the national meteorological agency. Although the annual hours and total enthalpy do not represent total cooling loads and savings, the yearly total hours marked as the red dots in Fig. 9 and total enthalpy in Table 7 can show the possibility of system cooling loads that can be controlled by the multi-variable DT models for better performance than the typical DT model. Therefore, weather data distributions in the boxes can help understand which climate zones have more cooling load savings potential when operating the multi-variable based economizer cycles in HVAC systems. For example, in Seoul, Korea, where this study was conducted, system cooling loads can be reduced when the facility managers determine the outside air faction based on the multi-variable DT controls to mitigate or eliminate latent loads in HVAC systems. Among the several cities in climate zones, Tampa, FL, Atlanta, GA, and New York, NY are expected to have the large cooling load-savings potential because the distributions on the psychrometric charts showed many red dots in the boxes and enthalpy of these cities due to high humidity ratios in the humid climates. Table 7 describes total hours and total enthalpy controlled by the multi-variable DT controls in different climate zones. Total hours refer to red-dot hours of the year governed by high-limit in the multi-variable DT methods (i.e., RH and HR based controls). Total enthalpy is accumulated enthalpy of total hours without consideration of supply air volume. Even though total hours and total enthalpy are not equal to building loads, more hours and enthalpy imply that the climate zones will be more affected by the multi-variable DT controls in economizer cycles, and a more savings potential would be expected in system cooling loads depending on the building environment. Table 7 showed that humid climates have higher enthalpy and total hours throughout the year compared to other climate zones. Also, total hours and total enthalpy confirmed where the multi-variable DT approach could be considered to seek more cooling load savings in buildings. 6 Conclusion In commercial buildings, one of the practical approaches to reduce cooling loads is to operate economizer controls. Economizers can mainly introduce outdoor air into air handling units in transition seasons for free cooling or reducing mechanical cooling. Theoretically, the enthalpy-based economizer control is a top-flight method rather than the temperature-based method in humid climates. However, in previous studies and our field survey, the enthalpy-based economizer controls were susceptible to sensor failures. Thus, the temperature-based economizer control is sometimes used as a substitute by building managers even though the impact of cooling load savings is smaller than the enthalpy-based method. Therefore, this study proposed the multi-variable differential temperature (DT) methods based on the outdoor air humidity from the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA). The proposed methods can help consider latent loads in the typical temperature-based controls without additional investment of humidity sensors in HVAC systems. To verify the impact of the proposed methods, the system loads in cooling coils were estimated using a large hospital in Seoul, Korea- mixed-humid climate zone (4A). The results showed that the multi-variable DT control is substantially effective in improving the energy efficiency of the conventional differential DT controls. In this study, the typical DT control had a 14.3% gap in the annual system cooling loads compared to the differential enthalpy control. However, the relative humidity (RH)-based multi-variable controls at the DT-RH60 were 4.4% more improved in cooling loads than the typical DT control. Also, the humidity ratio (HR)-based multi-variable controls showed up to 4.8% fewer cooling loads compared to the conventional DT operation at a high limit of 0.014 kg/kg. The relative humidity (RH)- humidity ratio (HR) combined high-limit controls of the multi-variable methods showed up to 4.8% of the cooling load savings at the combinations of the DT-RH50-70% and HR 0.014 and up to 4.4% of the cooling load savings by a combination of DT-RH80% and HR 0.016 under weather conditions in Korea. The approaches of this study would be used to improve the typical DT controls and help architects and engineers to seek more cooling energy savings potential using the DT controls, especially in humid climates. Further study will be conducted to develop better energy conservation measures using the multi-variable DT controls with advanced technologies, such as heating/cooling recovery systems. It will be advantageous to develop high-efficiency system operating methods for economizers.

As an energy conservation measure, an economizer can be used to reduce energy consumption and operating costs by introducing cold outdoor air into building space based on the outside air temperature or enthalpy. Among control types of economizer, enthalpy-based control is the more energy-efficient approach for the economizer cycle in Korea. However, in reality, humidity sensors are often out of order in buildings, which disables enthalpy-based controls in economizers. Therefore, as a practical substitute, multi-variable temperature-based control was investigated in this study using the local outdoor air humidity to consider latent loads in the typical temperature-based control and supplement the frequent failures of humidity sensors. The results showed the substantial energy savings potential in temperature-based control, which is driven by reduced system loads in cooling coils in a mixed-humid climate. Also, an analysis of the psychrometric charts represented that the impact of multi-variable temperature-based control would be more significant in humid climates than dry or marine regions. The proposed approach can complement the conventional differential dry-bulb temperature control method and provide a guide for improved economizer operations to achieve better energy performance in hot and humid climates.",
