The research shows an approach to develop and implement a control system in an observed building. For this purpose, two approaches with simulation results are presented. The first approach is theoretical in nature, with derived equations of a mathematical model. These models are presented in the program ©MATLAB Simulink with the results of temperature change simulations. The second experimental approach is the implementation of a real remote-control system developed with the ©Siemens TIA Portal software tool. It is based on derived system components from the mathematical model. The user interfaces of the system were created using the ©WinCC program. All this was done using the example of a family house with three residential units. The system was developed with the purpose of reducing the needs of thermal energy compared to the existing system. By measuring the heat energy needs, it was found that the new remote-control system reduces the heat energy needs by 12.4 % within one calendar year compared to the existing control system. The reason for this is the implementation of several operating modes in the system: night operation mode, working operation mode and rest operation mode. The system is implemented in such a way that the user can monitor and control the air temperature in the observed room from anywhere and at any time by using a cell phone, computer and Internet connection. It is possible that all housing units in the observed facility are controlled separately. The electric valves of the radiators are controlled by proportional\u2013integral\u2013derivative (PID) controllers. During the automatic adjustment of the PID controller parameters, the values were calculated: proportionality gain constant K = 1.26214 and gain constant of the integration part KI = 7.01238.

In this context, energy savings with the aim of energy reduction certainly were played a major role [1]. The following parameters had a great influence on the energy needs itself: the location of the building in relation to the climate in which it was located, the season mode and human factor. An example of the last factor is the heating of rooms, where there were no people during the day. This problem can be solved very efficiently with a remote-control system in the facility. Two terms, the concept and technology of smart homes, need to be distinguished. The most common definition of a smart home [2] mean that it is an object that can be controlled from anywhereon site or remotely via computer and/or cell phone. Another common definition states that it was an object that dynamically adapts to changes in thermal parameters and usage (i.e., the needs and requirements of the owner or user of the home). Dynamic adaptation of smart houses [3,4] would mean that when changes are made, energy is extracted and supplied only where, and how much is required. Smart home technology [5] means the definition for information and communication technology (ICT) used in buildings, where different devices communicate through a local area network. It can be used to monitor, alarm and perform certain functions according to set criteria. It was also allowed automatic communication with the users and other system devices through an Internet connection, as well as with normal home phones and mobile devices. Nowadays, energy efficiency was more in demand, as well as simpler control methods with minimal maintenance time in this type of technology [6]. The application of the remote-control system in such houses aims to be achieved better energy efficiency of the building. In most cases, heating, ventilation, air conditioning, lighting, anti-burglary systems, computers and networks, and other similar systems were controlled. The aim of this work was to combined two approaches: theoretical and experimental. In the theoretical approach, a mathematical model was developed that can serve the development engineer as a rough estimate for the system behaviour and as an aid in the subsequent development and implementation of the control system. Based on this, he can estimated which functions need to be created and programmed for the specified system in order to develop the specified control system. In addition, it should help to reduce thermal energy needs and achieved a more energy-efficient system. This was to be achieved by introducing working modes into the system. The entire control system was implemented as a remote type, so that the parameters can be set at any time and from any location via a cell phone or computer with wireless connection and Internet access. The theoretical approach was also allowed to evaluate the change of the observed variables in the system and facilitates the adjustment of the parameters of the PID controller. The control system will also included the possibility of automatic adjustment of these parameters. 2 Literature review In the existing literature, a number of papers can be found, dealing with the presentation of control algorithms and their implementation in building construction. To begin with, it is worth highlighting two review papers by Salsbury [7] and Behrooz et al. [8]. The paper [7] was reviewed the application of existing and new control algorithms in buildings. The next paper [8], was also given the description of different control algorithms and the methodology for controlling the observed values in HVAC systems. According to these two papers [7,8], the control algorithms and their implementation can be divided into several groups. According to the first author [8], they can be divided into modulating and switched systems. The mentioned algorithms were applicable for local installations as well as for SISO systems. The difference was that the modulating systems had a continuous character of the system, with a boundary between the saturation limits. Switched systems had two finite states such as on or off state. Modulating algorithms was included: a PID controller (the most commonly used) and some other control algorithms such as fuzzy logic controllers, neural networks and plant controllers. Among the works presenting the application of PID controllers, the work of Geng and Geary [9] was noteworthy. In most cases, derivative components were not applied, and the algorithm was essentially limited to the application and parameterization of the PID controller. For this purpose, several autotuning methods have been developed and their description can be found in works [10,11]. The use of fuzzy controllers can be founded in paper [12], that of neural networks in paper [13]. The use of fuzzy technique combinations and neural networks were addressed in [14,15]. The application of multi-agent applications using the fuzzy algorithm in local subsystems and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm were described in [16]. This algorithm was used to optimize comfort and energy needs by adjusting a number of points. Another work that uses the application of multi-agent control systems (MACS) was by Dounis and Caraiscos [17]. Advanced techniques was included the so-called plant models by Komareji et al. [18]. The usage of hybrid models, which combine several algorithms, are also quite common. One of them is the pattern recognition adaptive controller (PRAC), which was added to the conventional PID controller (Seem, [19]). PRAC was added here for the purpose of adjusting the control parameters. Among the modulating controllers, adaptive controllers can also be mentioned. Another type of adaptive controller was suitable for flow loops with constant velocity actuators (Federspiel, [20]). In this algorithm, the process includes an integrator, while static gain changes were significant during operation. According to another author [9], the control methods can again be divided into conventional and computer intelligent methods. The conventional methods can also be divided into the following subgroups: classical, digital and fuzzy methods. In addition, nowadays the Model Predictive Control algorithm was frequently used, which can be found in works [21 \u201323]. The mentioned algorithm was developed with the aim of achieving energy savings in buildings. In the subgroup of discrete algorithms two algorithms can be mentioned. The first one is the pulse width modulation (PWM) algorithm which generates a pulse signal [24] with the aim of reducing the average power of the transmitted signal. Another is the pulse width and pulse frequency modulation (PWPFM) algorithm. It can be implemented as a pulse adaptive modulation controller [25] with an adaptive loop to match the pulse to the desired amplitude. Also, there is approach [26] in which the developed mathematical model was combined with the communication of the built-in controller in real time with the acquisition of current data in the observed process. For this purpose, the computer package ©NI LabVIEW was used, in which a real-time model was developed as a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) system. The mentioned works were only demonstrated control algorithms and their respective performances. Their main drawback was that they do not provide the possibility of remote control via cell phone and/or computer in their implementation, as well as wireless connection via the Internet. The contribution of this work is as follows: \u2022 the theoretical approach was also allowed to evaluate the change of the observed variables in the control system and facilitates the adjustment of the parameters of the PID controller. \u2022 the control system with the SCADA system includes PID controllers attached to each electromotive valve of the radiator. In this way, the user can remotely controlled each radiator in each room of the building. In addition, the control system had the advantage of possibility to automatically setting the controller parameters. \u2022 by implementing operating modes into the control system; the user can reduced the expend of thermal energy in the entire object. Accordingly, the interaction between man and computer was also reduced compared to the existing control system. \u2022 the control system was implemented independently for each housing unit. Each user could enter the system with his own access code. \u2022 the use of smartphones and computers was possible, which facilitates the remote monitoring and control of the heating and DHW system. This was enabled users to monitor and control the room temperature at any time and from any place with Internet connection. 3 Description of existing thermotechnical system and control system implemented in plant The existing thermotechnical system was located in the building which is a family house with two residential units. These units were a family house consisting of two floors; a first floor and an attic, and a separate garage building with a housing unit in the attic. The boiler room was situated on the ground floor of the object. In this system, the heat energy is prepared with a gas boiler which was situated in the boiler room. Water with a temperature regime of 75/55 °C was delivered to the radiators through steel and copper pipelines. The heating and DHW system were made as a two-pipe system. Hot water distribution was provided with circulating pumps with the purpose of getting for achieving the required pressure drop. The gas boiler ©TERMOMAX had a heat energy of 28 kW and a DHW tank ©Vaillant has a water volume of 150 l. Fig. 1a was shown the system hydraulic scheme, while Figs. 1b and 1c were shown photos of the installed gas boiler and DHW tank. At the beginning of the process, the circulation pump for the heating/reheating DHW tank was stated first regarding hot water preparation. After that, the individual circulation pumps of the radiator circuits were started on according to the current room temperature. Room temperatures control was provided by bimetal thermostats. The major disadvantage of the existing control system is that the user must manually set the desired temperature on the thermostats installed in each room. 4 Presentation of theoretical model 4.1 Assumptions and constraints In creating the theoretical mathematical model of the thermal system [9], the assumptions and constraints were done: \u2022 a system model with concentrated parameters was used \u2013 temperature changes within the system were not considered. \u2022 in the DHW and pipeline model, it was assumed that there is no or very little heat energy loss through insulation. \u2022 a one-dimensional model of temperature change was observed. \u2022 in addition, all the thermal properties of the equipment and medium are constant with assumed temperature changes. 4.2 Equation model of heat flow state in system There are three observed temperatures in the system ϑu , ϑe and ϑi so a heat transfer was formed with 3 different heat types. The equilibrium of all brought and taken away heat flows must be contented so the following expression (1) applies [27,28]: (1) q t + q in - q out + q ins = q he , where is: qhe [W] \u2013 heat flow in the radiator, qin [W] \u2013 heat flow added to DHW tank, qins [W] \u2013 heat flow extracted by insulation, qm [W] \u2013 water heat flow in DHW tank, qout [W] \u2013 heat flow taken from DHW tank. The water heat flow qm in the DHW tank was calculated according to Eq. (2): (2) q m = C d ϑ dt . The heat flow discharged with hot water qout from the DHW tank was calculated according to equation (3): (3) q out = Q w c w ϑ . The heat flow supplied to the DHW tank with cold water qin was calculated according to Eq. (4): (4) q in = Q w c w ϑ in . The heat flow extracted by the insulation, i.e. the losses, qins correspond to the temperature difference between the environment and medium in the boiler. This is inversely proportional to the insulation thermal resistance. It is usually very large, i.e. several powers larger than the temperature difference which was meant that it is very small and can safely be neglected. It was calculated according to the following equation (5): (5) q ins = ϑ - ϑ in R ins By substituting the mathematical expressions ((2)\u2013(5)) into the expression (1), the state equation of the heat flows in the system (6) was obtained: (6) C d ϑ dt + Q w c w ( ϑ - ϑ in ) + ϑ - ϑ in R ins = q he where is: C [J / °C] \u2013 water heat capacity, d ϑ dt [°C / h] \u2013 increase of the DHW tank temperature over time t, Qw [kg / s] \u2013 water mass flow through the DHW tank, Rins [s°C / J] \u2013 insulation thermal resistance, c w [J / kg°C] \u2013 specific water heat capacity coefficient; cw = 4.187 kJ / kg°C (constant value is assumed in proposed model), ϑ in [°C] \u2013 water inlet temperature, ϑ [°C] \u2013 water tank temperature. 4.3 State equation reformulation of heat flows in the system The block scheme of the theoretical model was made according to the state equation of heat flows in the system (6), which includes all previously mentioned heat flows. By arranging the equation (6) according to the output variable of the DHW tank temperature ϑ, the following equation was obtained (7): (7) C d ϑ dt + Q w c v + 1 R ins ϑ = q he + Q w c v ϑ in + ϑ e R ins . By rearranging Eq. (7), deriving it according to time t and then integrating it, Eq. (8) was suitable and obtained for constructing the block scheme and shown in Fig. 2 : (8) ϑ = ∫ q he + Q w c v ϑ in + ϑ e R ins - Q w c v + 1 R ins ϑ C d t + ϑ 0 . Expression (8) was shown the temperature change ϑ in the DHW tank as a function of time t. Temperature ϑ o is the initial water temperature in the DHW tank [27,28]. 4.4 Definition of equations for mathematical model in ©MATLAB Simulink To create a block scheme for the simulation, the mathematical definition of the growth (rate) equations for each energy in the system was needed according to the following expressions [27,28]: (a) The equation for the increase of the supplied heat energy of the heater \u2013 can be represented as (9): (9) d Q in dt = d m h e a t _ w dt c w ( T heat - T room ) The change in the mass of water per hour passing through the radiators was expressed as a constant due to the simplicity of the model (10): (10) d Q in dt = M h e a t _ w c w ( T heat - T room ) (b) The equation for the increase of heat losses in the system \u2013 can be represented as (11): (11) d Q loss dt = kA ( T room - T e ) D . By replacing constant kA/D by 1/R, where R is the thermal resistance, Eq. (11) was simplified to obtain (12): (12) d Q loss dt = T room - T e R . (c) The equation of increase in room temperature \u2013 can be represented as Eq. (13): (13) d T room dt = 1 m air c w d Q in dt - d Q out dt . The given expression (13) helps us to create a simulation model. The following variables were also used in expressions ((7)\u2013(13)): d Q in dt [J / h] \u2013 increase of supplied water heat of heater over time t, d Q loss dt [J / h] \u2013 increase of heat energy loss in room over time t, d T room dt [°C / h] \u2013 increase of room temperature over time t, A [m2] \u2013 wall and window surface, D [m2] \u2013 wall and window thickness, k [J / mh°C] \u2013 thermal conductivity coefficient, mair [kg] \u2013 air mass in room, Mheat_w [kg/h] \u2013 water mass flow in heater, mheat_w [kg] \u2013 water mass in heater, Qin [W] \u2013 supplied water heat of heater, Qloss [W] \u2013 loss of heat energy in room, Te [°C] \u2013 environment temperature, Theat [°C] \u2013 boiler water temperature, Troom [°C] \u2013 air temperature in room, ϑe [°C] \u2013 environment temperature, ϑ o [°C] \u2013 initial water temperature in DHW tank. The variables and coefficients used in the derived mathematical model was shown in Table 1 . 5 Implementation of model in program ©MATLAB Simulink and presentation of simulation results In this section the simulation of the system model was presented, and only for the worst-case scenario. A room on the 2nd floor of a family house was selected. It is the most unfavourable i.e. the most energy inefficient, because of large heat losses. The program ©MATLAB Simulink was used to create the block scheme. Fig. 3 . was shown the block scheme of the heating for these rooms. It consists of 3 sub-blocks: Thermostat, Heater and Room. The Thermostat sub-block was used to detect a remarkable temperature difference between the room and reference value. The Heater sub-block was started only when the reference temperature is exceeding the value of the room temperature. The Room sub-block was described the state of the room system. Fig. 4 was shown the block scheme of the relay controller in the Thermostat sub-block. The relay controller has the task of controlling the temperature difference between the reference and room value. It was worked in such a way that it starts only when the value of the reference temperature is at least 1 °C higher than the value of the room temperature. In this case, the Heater sub-block was started. Fig. 5 was shown the Heater sub-block which represents the input heat energy controlled by the Thermostat sub-block. The Room sub-block (Fig. 6 .) was represented the room energy state, where the change in input heat energy minus the change in heat losses is calculated according to expression (12). If expression (13) was integrated than equation (14) was obtained. It was shown the room temperature change, which was returned to an output variable from the Room sub-block to the Thermostat and Heater sub-blocks. (14) T room = ∫ 1 m air c w ( d Q in dt - d Q out dt ) + T r o o m 0 The variable Troom0 in expression (14) was represented the initial temperature of the observed room at the beginning of the simulation. Units of seconds [s] were used on the time axis t. The environment temperature was simulated by the sin function with amplitude A = 6 °C, phase shift φ = 180° and frequency f = 2π/25 Hz. The sin function was simulated the increase of the environment temperature during morning and their decrease during evening through the observed day and it is marked in blue colour in Fig. 7 . The room temperature is marked in red colour in Fig. 7. To simulate the change in observed temperatures a set room temperature of 22 °C and a minimum room temperature of 17 °C were assumed (Fig. 8 ). Figs. 8 and 9 show a simulation of the temperature change in the observed room within 5 h during which the minimum and maximum daily environment temperatures are reached. 6 Implementation of control system in ©TIA portal program and SCADA system performance In the creation of the control program with the algorithm the computer program ©TIA portal manufactured by ©Siemens was used. Its purpose is programming, implementation and configuration of the PLC and HMI [29,30] devices that will serve as a remote control for the heating and DHW system in the observed object. The principle of this tool\u2019s operation is that all function blocks are written in ©Ladder language [29]. The goal of the developed algorithm was to reduced the needs of thermal energy while not being at home or during sleep. There are three operation modes regarding the observed system: Work operation mode, Night operation mode and Rest operation mode. When activating the Night operation mode the user were set the parameters through the HMI device, which include time for the mode of activation and deactivation. At the same time, the temperature is lowered to 17 °C in all rooms except bedrooms. During morning this mode was automatically deactivated and the temperatures are set to the previous values. In Work operation mode the tenant\u2019s working time can be entered. During his absence the temperature in the premises of the building is 17 °C. Before returning from work the building was heated according to the set parameters. For the realization of the remote-control system, a ©Siemens microcontroller type CPU 1212C DC /DC/ DC 6ES7212-1AE31-0XB0 PLC was used. The mentioned microcontroller has 2 analog inputs, 8 digital inputs and 6 digital outputs. Moreover, additional modules were used which are connected to it. The reason for this is that the controller in question does not have enough inputs and outputs. The analog inputs AI 8x13 bit were used as well as the analog output AQ 4x14 bit, and for the digital inputs/outputs DI 16/DQ. 6.1 Function of temperature limit The temperature limit function was controlled incorrect temperature entries and ensures correct entries ranging between 5 and 30 °C. Entering a temperature value below 5 °C does not change the operation of the heating system. All heaters were then set to inactive state. When entering a temperature value above 30 °C the safety thermostat on the water heater was activated and the system stopped operation until the error was corrected. Temperatures can be entered using a smartphone, computer or HMI device. An example of entering a command is given in Fig. 10 . 6.2 Input of scaling function The input sensors of the PLC are 3 thermostats and the temperature sensors of each room. The thermostats were used to universally set the desired temperature without an intelligent interface. Each observed room has its own sensor that detects the current room temperature. The sensors were connected to the PLC modules range in value from −10 to 10 V or from 4 to 20 mA. To manage their values more easily it is necessary to scale them. PLC sensors have a setpoint of 0 for minimum and 27.648 for maximum value. The values in between were read linearly over a range of 0.27648. The installed sensors had a temperature detection range of 0 to 40 °C, so with commands, it was scaled output in a range of 0 to 1 and is done linearly. An example of thermostat scaling was shown in Fig. 11 , since thermostats were limited to a range of 5\u201330 °C. 6.3 Valve control function The valve control function was scaled all the analog outputs and adjusts them to the PLC output values. The electro motor valves of the radiators in each room with variable openings were connected to the outputs of the PLC. The PLC outputs range from −10 to 10 V or 4 to 20 mA. However, within the PLC, these values were in a range of 0 to 27.648 and generated by linear distribution. The opening of the valve was displayed in the program as a percentage [%], i.e. in a range of 0 to 1, i.e. from 0 % open to 100 % open. In this way, the temperature in each room was controlled, as each room has its own radiator with its own electric valve connected to the PLC. Fig. 12 shows the performance of output scaling using the example of a room in the attic of a garage building. 6.4 Function Mode room With the function Mode room the temperature of individual rooms can be controlled depending on the active operating mode. In Night operation mode the rooms that were used the most during the day are heated, namely the living room, kitchen, etc. The bedrooms on the other hand, were not heated because they are not used during the day. In Night operation mode the situation was reversed during the night and the bedrooms are heated while the other rooms are not. In Work and Rest operation mode heating was only performed when one of the household members is at home, otherwise no room was heated. Each mode can be switched on and off. Fig. 13 . shows the situation when Night operation mode is active. Then, the high temperature is written into the reference temperatures for the bedrooms while the low temperature was written into the other rooms. When this mode was enabled, only the bedrooms were heated, while the rest of the living area is kept at a minimum comfort temperature. By default, the high temperature was set to 22 °C and low temperature to 17 °C without the user needing to enter a value. By disabling the night mode the high temperature was set as reference for the other rooms while the low temperature was set in the bedrooms (Fig. 14 ). 6.5 Function block Mode The function block Mode had its own data block in which all operating states on all floors of the system are stored. The purpose of the Mode function was to managed the heating modes (Night operation mode, Work operation mode and Rest operation). At the beginning of the function the PLC reads the current time and stores it in the variable TOD (Time of Delay) which was used as a reference time for defining the activation and deactivation conditions of the operation mode (Fig. 15 ). Fig. 16 was shown the manner of activating the operating mode. For this purpose, Night operation mode was selected. In case of deactivation the room was to be heated one hour before getting up. 6.6 Main block The functions and block functions described so far are called in the Main block. If a function was not called in the Main block the PLC does not execute it. It was runed at variable intervals with pauses on specific commands. For example, the functions for input sensor scaling and control of valves can be called (Fig. 17 ). When activating the manual operation mode the manipulated variable from the HMI must be in state 1. The set temperatures in all rooms were set according to the sensor value of the physical thermostat of the object. The example of the garage shows the activation of the manual operation mode where state 1 for the manipulated variable of the garage is required (Fig. 18 ). 6.7 PID controller The computer program ©TIA Portal was contained in itself the possibility of automatic parameter setting for the PID controller [31]. This was done during the first start-up of the system when the controller parameters were determined individually for each radiator valve. Each radiator valve in the system was controlled with an electric motor and PID controller. In this way the independence of temperature control by rooms was achieved. The valves control was carried out according to their opening mode percentage from 0 to 100 %. The set temperature is entered at the input while the room temperature was entered at the output of the controller. A range of 0 to 1, which corresponds to the valve opening mode, was defined as the controller output. Fig. 19 was shown an example of the input and output variables for the valve controller in room 1 on the attic of a garage building. The PID controller had the option of scaling input and output values in the event that a variable from an analog output or input is written directly to its input or output. In addition, it has a temperature limit of 0\u201340 °C, which is the range of the temperature room sensors. By automatically adjusting the controller parameters the following values were achieved: proportionality gain constant K = 1.26214, gain constant of the integration part KI = 7.01238. The gain constant of the derivative part KD was not used as it was not needed in this case. Fig. 20 was shown the regulation of the room temperature. The environment temperature change was shown by the sin function. If the transition function (response) of the PID was compared in relation to the relay controller [32], it was noticed that it is faster and more stable. The relay controller was operated a simple valve with open and closed state. Considering the degree of valve opening in these two states it cannot precisely maintained a constant room temperature, but instead oscillates around the reference value. Fig. 21 was shown a comparison of the transition functions regarding the PID and relay controller. 6.8 SCADA system performance In this study the SCADA system [33] was implemented through a smartphone and computer, through the ©Siemens data cloud and ©SMARTCLIENT application, i.e., through wireless Internet. The ©TIA portal application [34] also provided the ©WinCC program package that allowed programming such a smart interface. Fig. 22 was shown the appearance of the HMI interface start screen for the control of the heating system of 3 separate residential spaces in the observed objects. Due to the independence of the tenants there were three main entrances to the living spaces: ground floor, first floor and garage. At each entrance the option of the tenant registering is given which eliminates the possibility of mutual tenant interference in heating system of another. Each entrance has its own code, and after logging in, a control bit is set. The screens of all the floors in the buildings, are identical, thus their functionality is the same. Fig. 23 shows the start user interface of the first floor on the HMI device. As can be seen in Fig. 23, the first-floor home user interface has 5 buttons: Back, Ordinary Mode, Modes, Free Mode, and Manual/Automatic. Pressing the Back button returns you to the Home screen (Fig. 22). The Free Mode and Normal Mode buttons activate the modes: Ordinary Mode or Normal Mode. The Modes button opens a new screen where you can find settings for Night operation Mode, Work operation Mode and Rest operation Mode (Fig. 24 ). For each mode there is a separate button with a coloured border that lights up green when the mode is on or red when it is off. Clicking these button turns the mode on if it was previously off, off if it was previously on. For all three modes the parameters for the on and off times and the maximum and minimum temperatures change. The Manual/Auto toggle button activates the manual mode, otherwise the unit defaults to the automatic mode. The left side of the user interface displays all the temperature inputs of the PID controller on the first-floor rooms. The first-floor plan in the centre was illustrated the current temperatures in the rooms. Fig. 25 was shown the settings screen for normal operation mode on the first floor. The created user interfaces were very easy to use and understand, which make it much easier for a user who does not have much experience in using similar systems to follow and adjust the desired settings regarding the operating modes. Finally, a comparison of the thermal energy needs in operating periods for 2022 was given. It can be stated that the installation of the newly introduced control system reduced the needs of thermal energy by 12.4 %. 7 Conclusion In this paper the approach to implement a control system in a family house was shown. For this purpose, two approaches with simulation results were presented. These approaches are: theoretical with mathematical model and experimental with implemented remote control system. A comparison of thermal energy needs over an observed year was also included. The following was found during the creation of the mathematical model, model simulation measurements after implementation of control system in the house (for observed room): \u2022 given the nature of the observed thermotechnical system (explicitly linear system with expressed time delay), a linear first-order ordinary differential equation is sufficient to describe it. This reduced the complexity of solving the mathematical model and facilitates the implementation of the simulation model; \u2022 a more energy efficient system was achieved by lowering the reference room temperature. Depending on the temperature difference between the room and environment, much heat energy was needed. \u2022 the existing control system in the facility was not well implemented. The reason for this was the installation of separate thermostats in each room. In fact, such a design was very difficult to be operated, as it was difficult for the user to monitor the set room temperature. \u2022 the theoretical approach was allowed to evaluate the change of the observed variables in the control system and facilitates the adjustment of the controller parameters. \u2022 by also introducing several modes of operation: Night operation mode, Work operation mode and Rest operation mode, it was reduced the need for thermal energy throughout the facility. They were created for the reason of operating mode settings, in which the system automatically changes from one program to another over time. \u2022 the implemented remote-control system as part of the SCADA system was included PID controllers attached to each electro motor valve of the radiator. The advantage of the system was that it had possibility to automatically sets their parameters: proportionality of gain constant K and gain constant of the integration part KI . Using the settings, the values were calculated: proportionality gain constant K = 1.26214 and gain constant of the integration part KI = 7.01238. \u2022 all housing units in the observed building were controlled separately with the implemented remote-control system. Each user has access to the control system via its own code. \u2022 the use of smart cell phones and computers was possible, which facilitated the remote monitoring and control of heating and DHW system. \u2022 by comparing the heat energy needs, it was found that on an annual average (considered over all 12 months) for both systems (heating system + DHW system), the use of the newly introduced control system was reduced needs by 12.4 %. As direction of future work, the application of a different algorithm for the remote-control system performance in a smart building (e.g. Model Predictive Control) should be considered. In addition, the application of a self-tuning MPC controller can be considered, as well as its extension using a neural network. In addition, an attempt should be made to apply the existing system to a more complex system that includes ventilation and air conditioning systems in addition to heating. In addition, the influence of some disturbances in the system, such as a change in weather conditions in the environment, should also be considered.

        "dc:description": "The research shows an approach to develop and implement a control system in an observed building. For this purpose, two approaches with simulation results are presented. The first approach is theoretical in nature, with derived equations of a mathematical model. These models are presented in the program ©MATLAB Simulink with the results of temperature change simulations. The second experimental approach is the implementation of a real remote-control system developed with the ©Siemens TIA Portal software tool. It is based on derived system components from the mathematical model. The user interfaces of the system were created using the ©WinCC program. All this was done using the example of a family house with three residential units. The system was developed with the purpose of reducing the needs of thermal energy compared to the existing system. By measuring the heat energy needs, it was found that the new remote-control system reduces the heat energy needs by 12.4 % within one calendar year compared to the existing control system. The reason for this is the implementation of several operating modes in the system: night operation mode, working operation mode and rest operation mode. The system is implemented in such a way that the user can monitor and control the air temperature in the observed room from anywhere and at any time by using a cell phone, computer and Internet connection. It is possible that all housing units in the observed facility are controlled separately. The electric valves of the radiators are controlled by proportional\u2013integral\u2013derivative (PID) controllers. During the automatic adjustment of the PID controller parameters, the values were calculated: proportionality gain constant K = 1.26214 and gain constant of the integration part KI = 7.01238.",
