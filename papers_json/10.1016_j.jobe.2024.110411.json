Genetic algorithms (GA) have been utilized in several HVAC optimization studies. Kampelis et al. [28] employed a genetic algorithm for operational optimization of an HVAC system, balancing the trade-off between minimum daily cost and thermal comfort. Nasruddin et al. [29] combined ANN and a genetic algorithm to optimize the two-chiller system operation in a building, minimizing annual energy consumption and maximizing thermal comfort. Nisa et al. [30] utilized a genetic algorithm to optimize HVAC operating parameters to prevent fogging in ice rink environment. Yang et al. [31] applied GA for optimal control of the condensing temperature set point, improving the coefficient of performance (COP) of air-cooled chillers under various operating conditions. Chen et al. [32] combined support vector machine (SVM) and GA to find operating parameters with the least air conditioning system power consumption.This work is supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan, grant number MOST 111-2221-E-167-015 and Shangcheng Mechanical and Electrical Engineering Co.

Optimizing air handling units (AHUs) in multi-zone buildings presents significant challenges. As buildings become more complex, the demand for tailored temperature control across various zones becomes paramount. This study leverages multi-zone building data with machine learning-based models and optimization techniques to optimize AHUs by specifically integrating deep neural network (DNN) modeling, clustering analysis, and a genetic algorithm (GA). We developed 18 models to predict AHU supply air temperature ( T s a ) and 2 models to predict chiller power consumption ( P ) using DNN. Clustering analysis was applied to the return air temperature ( T r a ) of each AHU, serving as initial conditions for the GA. The clustering analysis provided insights into the AHU operational behavior, enhancing the optimization process precision. The GA's objective function maintained the AHUs' T s a and minimized P by adjusting parameters such as valve openings, fan frequencies, chilled water supply temperature, and cooling water flowrate. The results indicated that DNN models demonstrated high predictive accuracy, with 16 models showing an R2 higher than 0.96. The results suggested that AHU411 requires increased capacity during high T r a condition, while AHU212 needs an enhanced model with more diverse training data or the incorporation of additional influencing factors. Validation revealed that this approach improved temperature maintenance across zones, with 96 % of the data falling within demand temperature range ( T s e t ), and achieving T s e t required 41 % higher power input.

AHUs play a significant role in regulating indoor air quality and temperature by supplying and circulating conditioned air throughout the building. Implementing a multi-zone system becomes imperative to address diverse needs such as ensuring thermal comfort for occupants [1], maintaining controlled environments for equipment, and meeting other specific requirements. As buildings become more complex, the demand for tailored temperature control across various zones becomes paramount [2]. Water-cooled chiller units are a crucial component of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems designed to produce chilled water for heat load removal [3]. This technology uses a cooling tower to transfer heat from the chiller's condenser to the surrounding atmosphere. The produced chilled water is then supplied to the AHUs. Chillers account for over 40 % of the total energy consumption in commercial and industrial buildings, highlighting that energy savings in these systems can have a significant impact [4]. For energy efficiency and sustainable building practices, optimizing AHUs is essential for occupant comfort and also crucial for minimizing overall energy consumption. Balancing optimal performance and energy consumption necessitates innovative solutions in the design and operation of multi-zone buildings. Buildings have been increasingly equipped with data-capturing capabilities for their HVAC systems, resulting in comprehensive chiller databases. Leveraging this recorded data offers an opportunity to construct models for AHU supply air temperature and chiller power consumption. Developing accurate AHU and chiller models is a critical phase in the optimization process, directly impacting energy efficiency and demand conditions. Various methods exist for constructing these models, including mathematical models, EnergyPlus, eQuest, artificial neural networks (ANN), and others [5]. Machine learning has gained popularity and is increasingly applied in buildings for modeling and optimization tasks, offering a data-driven approach to enhancing energy performance and operational efficiency. 1.2 Literature reviews 1.2.1 Neural network in multi-zone building Several studies have investigated neural networks applications in the multi-zone building modeling or control. Huang et al. [6] introduced an ANN-based system identification method to model multi-zone buildings, capturing thermal interactions between zones. Their model-based predictive control method demonstrated that comfortable temperatures could be maintained with reduced energy consumption. Amin et al. [7] developed an intelligent price-based demand response (PBDR) control strategy using ANN to optimize HVAC operation, accommodating diverse thermal preferences in different zones, and responding to real-time pricing (RTP) signals. Cui et al. [8] developed a recurrent neural network (RNN) model for predicting indoor temperatures in multi-zone buildings, offering higher computational efficiency compared to resistance-capacitance (RC) models. Xing et al. [9] proposed MITP-Net, a deep-learning framework for short-term indoor temperature prediction, utilizing multiple sensor information fusion to enhance accuracy. Fu et al. [10] introduced the event-driven deep Q network (ED-DQN) method for HVAC control in multi-zone residential buildings, achieving superior energy consumption control while maintaining thermal comfort compared to traditional reinforcement learning methods. Gao et al. [11] presented an optimal energy management strategy for the demand response of multi-thermal-zone buildings, using neural networks to minimize electricity costs and reduce energy consumption during peak load hours. Drgoňa et al. [12] utilized a real-world dataset to develop control-oriented models with a physics-constrained deep learning approach, incorporating physics-based knowledge into a structured recurrent neural architecture. Qaisar et al. [13] integrated data from multiple sensors into an occupancy prediction transformer network (OPTnet) for predicting future occupancy in multiple zones, outperforming other prediction methods like decision trees and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. Irani et al. [14] introduced a data-driven approach for sensor fault detection and isolation in multi-zone HVAC systems, integrating the bilinear Koopman model realization, deep learning, and bilinear parity-space. The results show immediate and precise fault diagnosis for detectable faults. Mtibaa et al. [15] presented Model Predictive Control via Genetic algorithm (MPC-GA), a novel online data-driven control framework using Model Predictive Control via a Genetic Algorithm, for optimal HVAC operation. Validated in a multi-zone retail building, results showed MPC-GA reduces energy consumption by over 50 % and discomfort by over 80 % compared to rule-based controllers (RBC) systems. 1.2.2 Neural network in AHU Neural networks have also been extensively used for AHU model. Hosamo et al. [16] proposed a digital twin predictive AHU maintenance framework using various machine learning techniques to overcome the limitations of facility maintenance management (FMM) systems currently in use in buildings. Norouzi et al. [17] explored five suitable algorithms to predict indoor temperatures in a multi-zone HVAC system within an educational building. The proposed deep neural network (DNN) model achieved the highest accuracy, with an average RMSE of 0.16 °C. Son et al. [18] investigated an AHU to predict the operating dynamics without a static pressure sensor. The proposed method replaces the static pressure sensor with the DNN. Sukthankar et al. [19] employed an ANN to predict AHU\u2019 supply air temperature to overcome the limitations of computational fluid dynamics (CFD), such as high cost, the requirement for expertise, and extensive computation time. The model provides significantly faster predictions compared to full CFD simulations, maintaining good prediction accuracy. Yun et al. [20] proposed a fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) model based on a neural network. This model demonstrates the capability to perform reliable FDD on air handling unit (AHU) systems by considering undefined situations, thereby facilitating the maintenance of AHU systems. Optimization using neural networks has also been studied. Jee et al. [21] developed an artificial intelligence (AI) based real-time prediction and control model to optimize condenser water temperature and discharge air temperature set points in a water-cooled AHU system. Zou et al. [22] optimized AHU control by implementing LSTM to build deep reinforcement learning (DRL) training environments, achieving energy savings of 27%\u201330 % compared to actual consumption while keeping the predicted percentage of discomfort (PPD) at 10 %. Lee et al. [23] proposed an optimization strategy for AHU systems using an autotuned PID control method based on a virtual building simulator, reducing cooling energy consumption by up to 13.71 % on average daily. 1.2.3 Clustering analysis in HVAC system Clustering analysis has been applied in various studies of HVAC systems. An et al. [24] proposed clustering analysis to identify air-conditioning (AC) use patterns to explore AC operation characteristics using long-term metered cooling energy use data, aiming to understand thermal energy use and save energy cost through AC use behavior adjustment. Du et al. [25] used clustering analysis to classify various faulty conditions adaptively in buildings. The different faults can be separated into distinct zones in the data space. Besides the known faults in the library, new unknown faults can be recognized and implemented adaptively into the fault library. Wickramasinghe et al. [26] conducted clustering analysis to identify temperature clusters per building floor. Zhou et al. [27] applied clustering analysis to optimally partition an AC room into different zones, observing that the extreme learning machine (ELM) model assigns more weight to indoor air velocity for the thermal comfort index. 1.2.4 Genetic algorithm in HVAC optimization Genetic algorithms (GA) have been utilized in several HVAC optimization studies. Kampelis et al. [28] employed a genetic algorithm for operational optimization of an HVAC system, balancing the trade-off between minimum daily cost and thermal comfort. Nasruddin et al. [29] combined ANN and a genetic algorithm to optimize the two-chiller system operation in a building, minimizing annual energy consumption and maximizing thermal comfort. Nisa et al. [30] utilized a genetic algorithm to optimize HVAC operating parameters to prevent fogging in ice rink environment. Yang et al. [31] applied GA for optimal control of the condensing temperature set point, improving the coefficient of performance (COP) of air-cooled chillers under various operating conditions. Chen et al. [32] combined support vector machine (SVM) and GA to find operating parameters with the least air conditioning system power consumption. 1.3 Research gaps and objectives In the existing literature, neural networks have been utilized in AHUs or multi-zone buildings as described in section 1.2.1 and 1.2.2. However, the application of neural networks in AHUs within multi-zone buildings is very limited. Moreover, while clustering analysis has been used to identify patterns and classify conditions in HVAC systems (section 1.2.3), it has not been combined with advanced predictive modeling and optimization methods. Similarly, GAs have been employed for HVAC optimization (section 1.2.4), yet their application in multi-zone buildings is non-existent. While previous studies have achieved significant results in either predictive modeling or optimization independently, our study's novelty lies in this comprehensive integration specifically for AHUs in multi-zone buildings. Despite the advancements in utilizing these techniques, a significant gap persists. To the best of our knowledge, no studies have combined DNN, clustering analysis, and GA to optimize AHU supply air temperature ( T s a ) in multi-zone buildings. This combination presents a valuable opportunity, as the DNN can build precise models for AHU T s a and chiller power consumption ( P ), which can then be used as a basis for optimization using the GA to meet T s a requirements while minimizing P . To enhance scalability and practical application, clustering can be used to characterize each AHU, serving as the initial condition for the GA. This approach demonstrates strong potential and practical implementation capabilities, addressing real-world challenges in HVAC systems by leveraging multi-zone data. Moreover, this method can potentially be scaled and adapted to different systems, highlighting its versatility and effectiveness. The primary objective of this paper is to optimize the AHU by maintaining each zone's T s a while considering P . The specific study objectives are as follows: (1) Develop 18 models to predict T s a of AHUs, and 2 models to predict P using DNN. (2) Cluster the return air temperature ( T r a ) of each AHU to characterize each AHU, serving as the initial condition for GA optimization. (3) Utilize GA to maintain AHU T s a and minimize P by optimizing chiller operating parameters such as chilled water supply temperature ( T c h w ) and cooling water flowrate ( V c w ), along with AHU operating parameters like valve openings ( V O ) and fan frequency ( f ). (4) Validate the optimized operating parameters obtained from GA using the dataset. The structure of this paper is as follows. Section 2 presents the building investigation. Section 3 outlines the methodology, covering the conceptual framework, dataset description, and the algorithm utilized. In Section 4, we present the results and engage in a comprehensive discussion. The key conclusions and future works are summarized in Section 5. 2 The investigated building This study investigated a telecommunication equipment building in Taiwan, which has 5 floors. The first floor consists of 2 AHUs, while the second to fifth floors each have 4 AHUs, totaling 18 AHUs. Fig. 1 shows the schematic of the AHUs and zones on each floor. Overall, there are four zones. The building utilizes a dual-chiller system, as depicted in Fig. 2 . This system includes two chilled water units (CH), three chilled water pumps (CHP), three zone pumps (ZP), three cooling water pumps (CWP) and two cooling towers (CT). The blue pipes represent the chilled water loop, where the chilled water from chiller's evaporator is pumped to cooling coils within the AHUs. This process facilitates heat absorption from the ambient air inside the building. Afterward, the water cycles back to the evaporator for further cooling. The red pipes symbolize the condenser water loop, where condenser water from the chiller is pumped to the cooling tower to expel heat. Subsequently, the cooled condenser water returns to the chiller to complete the thermal exchange cycle. Although the building has a dual-chiller system, only one chiller operates at a time, alternating between the two units. AHUs serve as the primary mechanism for air circulation within the building, regulating temperature and humidity levels [33]. Fig. 3 illustrates the AHU process: return air (RA) and outdoor air (OA) enter the system, pass through a filter for purification, and proceed through the cooling coil to regulate temperature before being distributed into the rooms. For this study, the system is set to 100 % RA, meaning it only circulates indoor air. Table 1 provides information on the zones, operating time percentages, and the percentage of data within the demand temperature range ( T s e t ) range for AHUs. For each zone, the T s e t is defined by the minimum ( T min ) and maximum demand temperatures ( T max ). The building is divided into four zones, with the chiller typically operating as a single unit, either CH1 or CH2. Additionally, each AHU does not run continuously for 24 h and occasionally turns off. Regarding the total operating time percentage, 12 AHUs operate for more than 50 % of the time, while the remaining 6 AHUs operate for less than 50 %. For the total data within T s e t percentage, 9 AHUs have 50 % of their data within the T s e t range, indicating a limited amount of data achieving the T s e t . 3 Methods 3.1 Conceptual framework Fig. 4 illustrates the workflow diagram used in this study. The process begins with data collection, where the dataset is gathered from AHUs and chillers via the BMS. Weather data is obtained from the nearest weather station. The dataset undergoes preprocessing, which includes data cleaning to remove irrelevant information for each model. The cleaned data is then split into training, validation, and test sets, followed by data scaling. After preprocessing, we develop AHU and chiller models using DNN, resulting in a total of 20 models. Concurrently, T r a clustering is performed for each AHU using the k-means algorithm. These models are integrated into a GA, with the centroid of each cluster serving as the initial conditions. Upon executing the GA, we obtained optimum parameters such as T c h w , V c w , V O ( j ) , and f ( j ) , where j indicates the specific AHU. The GA results are then validated against the dataset based on the clustering. Finally, a comparison is made between the actual, predicted, and optimized values for T r a ( j ) and P i ,where i indicates either CH1 or CH2. 3.2 Data collection The dataset was collected at hourly intervals for a year and includes data from 18 AHUs and 2 chillers obtained from the BMS, along with weather data from the nearest weather station. Each AHU provides data on V O ( j ) , f ( j ) , T r a ( j ) , and T s a ( j ) . The AHU status data is manually categorized as either off or on, based on fan frequency and valve opening values s t a t ( j ) , where j indicates the specific AHU, such as AHU111, AHU112, \u2026, AHU511. Additionally, for each chiller, the collected data includes T c h w i , V c w i , and P i , with i denoting the chillers unit, either CH_1 or CH_2. The weather data collected includes outdoor air temperature ( T o a ) and outdoor air humidity ( R H o a ). 3.3 Data preprocessing The collected data undergoes preprocessing, which involves cleaning the data to remove missing or incorrect measurements. Each model has its own dataset corresponding to the specific data related to that model. Each AHU model uses the data when its AHU operated, regardless of whether it was using CH1 or CH2. Each chiller model uses the data when its chiller operated. For the DNN models, the data was split into three sets: 70 % for training, 15 % for validation, and 15 % for testing. A normalization technique, as described in equation (1), was applied to scale the data. (1) x n o r m i = x ( i ) − x min x max − x min Where x n o r m i , x ( i ) , x min , and x max , represent normalized value, observed value, the minimum value in the dataset, and the maximum value in the dataset, respectively. 3.4 DNN model The DNN model was developed to predict the T s a ( j ) of each AHU and the P i of each chiller. The DNN architecture for predicting (a) T s a ( j ) and (b) P i is illustrated in Fig. 5 . The T s a ( j ) model includes four input variables: T c h w , V O ( j ) , T r a ( j ) , and f ( j ) . These inputs are related to T s a ( j ) . These inputs are connected to three hidden layers, each with 10 hidden neurons. The final hidden layer is linked to the output layer, which represents the predicted T s a ( j ) . On the other hand, the P i model incorporates 94 inputs, including two chiller-related variables ( T c h w i & V c w i ), two weather-related variables ( T o a and R H o a ), and 90 AHU-related variables ( V O ( j ) , T r a ( j ) , T s a ( j ) , f ( j ) , and s t a t ( j ) from 18 AHUs). The input layer is connected to five hidden layers, each with 50 hidden neurons. Subsequently, the hidden layers are interconnected with the output layer representing the predicted P i [34] The output of a neuron is described by equation (2), where the input ( x i ), weight ( w i ), and bias ( b ) collectively contribute to the output ( y ) [35]. The activation function ( f ), represented by the rectifier linear unit (ReLU), introduces non-linearity to the neuron's output for capturing complex patterns in the data. The objective of a neural networks' training is to minimize the loss function, which quantifies the difference between the predicted and actual values [36]. Equation (3) demonstrates the mean squared error (MSE), a widely-used loss function in regression tasks. Grid-search hyperparameter tuning is employed to identify the optimal learning rate from the set [0.01, 0.005, 0.001, 0.0005], while the remaining hyperparameters are searched manually. (2) y = f ( ∑ i x i w i + b ) (3) M S E = 1 N ∑ i = 1 N ( Y i − P i ) 2 3.5 Performance evaluations The model performance is assessed using three metrics: mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and coefficient of determination (R2). These three metrics are formulated as in equations (4)\u2013(6): (4) M A E = 1 N ∑ i = 1 N | Y i − P i | (5) R M S E = 1 N ∑ i = 1 N ( Y i − P i ) 2 2 (6) R 2 = 1 − ∑ i = 1 N ( Y i − P i ) 2 ∑ i = 1 N ( Y i − Y \u203e ) 2 Where, N, Y i , P i , and Y \u203e , refer to the number of samples, measured value, predictive value, and average measured value, respectively. 3.6 K-means clustering analysis Clustering is one of the most important unsupervised machine learning techniques widely used in many fields. Clustering analysis groups objects into clusters so that within the same cluster they are similar to each other and dissimilar to objects in any other cluster [37\u201339]. The k-means algorithm is a clustering algorithm proposed by J.B.MacQueen [40]. The k-means algorithm partitions a dataset to minimize the squared error between data points and their clusters. Let X = { x i }( i = 1, \u2026., n ), represent a set of n d -dimensional points to be clustered into K clusters, C = { c k } ( k = 1, \u2026, K ). Equation (7) represents the objective function for a single cluster c k , where, μ k is the cluster centroid c k , and \u2016 x i − μ k \u2016 is the Euclidean distance between x i and μ k . (7) J ( c k ) = ∑ x i ∈ c k \u2016 x i − μ k \u2016 2 The goal of the k-means algorithm is to minimize the total sum of the squared error over all K clusters, as shown in equation (8) [41]. (8) J ( C ) = ∑ k = 1 K ∑ x i ∈ c k \u2016 x i − μ k \u2016 2 The k-means algorithm begins by randomly selecting K centroids from the dataset. Each data point's distance from all the selected centroids is evaluated using the Euclidean distance. Each data point is then assigned to the closest centroid. The centroids are then updated by recalculating each centroid as the mean of all data points assigned to it. Assigning data points to centroids and updating centroids are performed iteratively until the cluster membership stabilizes, typically when the centroids no longer change significantly between iterations [42,43]. In this study, the T r a ( j ) of each AHU is clustered into three categories: low, medium, and high. Using three clusters for all AHUs ensures consistency and effectively represents the full temperature range without being overly complex. This approach simplifies the clustering model used in the optimization process, making it manageable while still capturing the essential variations from low to high temperatures. 3.7 Genetic algorithm The genetic algorithm (GA) is a search heuristic inspired by the principles of natural selection and genetics. It is utilized to find optimal or near-optimal solutions for complex problems through iterative processes involving reproduction, selection, crossover, and mutation [44,45]. The essential steps of the GA optimization process are depicted in Fig. 6 . Initially, a random population of potential solutions is generated within specified upper and lower bounds. The fitness function, representing the objective function, is then evaluated for each individual. Based on these evaluations, the most suitable individuals are selected as parents to create the next generation. These parents undergo crossover to combine their genetic information and mutation to introduce diversity. This cycle repeats, generating new populations to replace old ones until the termination criteria are satisfied [46]. For each chiller operation, the building is assumed to exhibit three variations based on the clustering of T r a : low, medium and high. When using the low variation, all AHU T r a ( j ) in the building are set to the centroid of the low cluster obtained from clustering, and similarly for the medium and high variations. Therefore, the optimization process considers these three variations. The first genetic algorithm ( G A 1 i ) round involves multi-objective optimization to minimize both P i and temperature error ( Δ T ) for each of the three variations. The optimization parameters include two chiller parameters ( T c h w , and V c w ) and 18 AHU parameters ( V O ( j ) , and f ( j ) ). In practical scenarios, each AHU T r a ( j ) values in the building may vary and cluster into low, medium and high. Despite these variations, the chiller parameters must remain consistent. Consequently, the second round of the genetic algorithm ( G A 2 i ) is implemented, where the initial conditions for the chiller parameters are set to the average values derived from G A 1 i , specifically T c h w \u203e , and V c w \u203e . The G A 2 i focuses on single-objective optimization to minimize Δ T , with the optimization parameters being the 18 AHU parameters ( V O ( j ) , and f ( j ) ). The outputs T c h w \u203e , V c w \u203e , V O ( j ) , and f ( j ) from GA are then validated against the dataset. Table 2 presents the GA setup information for each round. Equation (9) defines the temperature error for each AHU ( Δ T ( j ) ) . A penalty of 0 is assigned when T min ( j ) ≤ T s a ( j ) ≤ T max ( j ) , otherwise the absolute error is assigned. In this equation, T s e t ( j ) represents the midpoint of the T s e t ( j ) range. The average Δ T is then computed as shown in equation (10). The fitness function for G A 1 , which scales the objective functions to the range [0, 1] to ensure balanced optimization, is given in equation (11). The weights applied are 0.7 for the scaled temperature error ( Δ T \u2032 ) and 0.3 for scaled chiller power ( P i \u2032 ). The fitness function of G A 2 i , focused on minimizing Δ T , is shown in equation (12). The upper and lower bounds for each variable are determined based on their respective minimum and maximum values utilized in model development. The genetic algorithm is configured with a population size of 100, a crossover rate of 0.8, a mutation rate of 0.2, a maximum of 200 generations, and a crowding factor of 10.

The x-axis denotes actual T s a ( j ) values, while the y-axis denotes predicted T s a ( j ) values, with blue dots representing training data and green dots representing test data. All plots share a consistent scale ranging from 9 °C to 20 °C. The red line, indicative of perfect prediction, shows that most data points cluster closely around it, signifying high accuracy in the model's predictions. Notably, AHU211, AHU231, AHU311, AHU 312, and AHU331 exhibit minimal variation in T s a ( j ) , with differences not exceeding 2 °C; however, the models still accurately capture these values within this narrow range. Overall, the figure demonstrates that the predictive models exhibit robust performance and reliability across various AHUs, confirming their suitability for practical application. 4.1.2 Chiller model Fig. 8 illustrates scatter plots of the power consumption for actual and predicted models (a) CH1 and (b) CH2. The x-axis represents the actual power consumption, while the y-axis represents the predicted power consumption. Blue dots indicate training data, and the green dots represent the testing data. In both models, the data points align closely along the red diagonal line (y = x), signifying a high correlation between actual and predicted values. This alignment demonstrates that the models accurately predict power consumption with minimal error. 4.1.3 Model evaluations Table 3 evaluates chiller and AHU models using three key metrics: RMSE, MAE, and R2, assessed on both training and testing datasets. Most models exhibit high R2 values, greater than 0.96, close to 1, indicating a strong fit to the data. However, a few AHU models, such as AHU211, AHU311, AHU312, and AHU331, discussed in section 4.1.1, show lower R2 values. Despite this, their MAE and RMSE values remain below 0.2 °C, which is acceptable for our study. The power models demonstrate high R2 values, with RMSE and MAE values below 2 kW, indicating a good fit to the data. 4.2 K-means clustering Fig. 9 illustrates the AHU\u2019 T r a clustering results, categorized into low, medium, and high clusters across various AHU units. The horizontal axis represents the temperature for both T r a and range of T s e t , while the vertical axis lists the different AHU units. The plot uses different colored markers to denote various temperature ranges: blue, green, and red represent the low, medium, and high range of AHU\u2019 T r a , respectively. The yellow dots indicate the centroids of each cluster, representing the central value within each cluster across the AHUs. Black markers show the range of AHUs' T s e t . Including T s e t range in this figure illustrate the targeted supply air temperatures for each unit from each respective centroid. 4.3 Optimization The results obtained from G A 1 indicate that for CH1, the values for T c h w and V c w are 7.6 °C and 5,364 LPM, respectively, while for CH2, they are 7.7 °C and 4,121 LPM. These findings serve as the initial conditions for G A 2 . Fig. 10 illustrates the G A 2 \u2019 minimum fitness over generations for various T r a ( j ) in two cases: (a) CH1 and (b) CH2. The plots depict the convergence behavior of the genetic algorithm under three T r a ( j ) conditions: low, medium, and high. In both CH1 and CH2, the minimum fitness value decreases significantly during the initial generations, indicating rapid improvement in solution quality. As the number of generations increases, the rate of fitness improvement diminishes and eventually stabilizes. For both cases, the low variation of T r a ( j ) condition consistently achieves the lowest minimum fitness values, followed by medium and high T r a ( j ) . This indicates that the lower T r a ( j ) is more effective in minimizing the fitness value, thereby achieving the T s e t . Theoretically, when the return air temperature ( T r a ( j ) ) is higher, an increased valve opening (VO) is typically required to achieve the desired supply air temperature ( T s a ). For fan frequency ( f ), increasing it can raise the airflow rate, which reduces the contact time between the air and the cooling coil, leading to lower heat transfer and a smaller difference between T r a ( j ) and T s a . Fig. 11 illustrates the optimum AHU parameter under different T r a ( j ) conditions. The three sub-figures show the results for T r a ( j ) (a) low, (b) medium, and (c) high. These figures indicate that optimal settings for V O ( j ) and f ( j ) vary across different T r a ( j ) conditions. The upper and lower operating parameter boundaries for each AHU differ according to their respective minimum and maximum values utilized in model development. The optimal operating parameters generated by the GA do not exhibit a straightforward linear relationship. When T r a is higher, the V O does not consistently increase; it sometimes increases or decreases. This variability suggests that incorporating fan frequency (f) into the optimization process can adjust the conditions to achieve T s e t . The relationship between T r a ( j ) , V O , and f is non-linear in achieving T s e t due to several influencing factors that were not included in this analysis: \u2022 Airflow: The airflow is not constant and varies based on demand. \u2022 Chilled water flowrate: The chilled water flowrate is also variable, as this parameter was not included in the optimization. \u2022 Control strategy: The set points used during model training affect the behavior of the operating parameters. These factors contribute to the optimization process complexity and suggest that achieving the T s e t involves a nuanced balance of multiple interacting variables. The optimal operational parameters can be identified using the GA. It is important to noted that the GA results is based on the AHU and chiller model, which trained by the data collected according to their behavior. 4.4 Validation The operating parameter obtained is then validated using the whole collected data. Three data are compared, actual, predicted, and optimized. The actual data is the collected data, the prediction is the model output where all inputs use the actual data. The optimization is the model output where initialized with the same T o a , R H o a , and T r a as the actual conditions, and using the GA-derived parameters ( T c h w , V c w , V O ( j ) , and f ( j ) ), consistently achieves the range of T s e t . Fig. 12 depict the comparison between actual, prediction, and optimization T s a ( j ) across all zones. The red line represents the actual, and the blue line represents the prediction. A comparison between the actual and prediction values reveals that the model, when using the same input conditions as the actual system, accurately predict the T s a ( j ) . This suggests a high degree of reliability in the model's predictions. The optimization results are illustrated with the green line, where it mostly falls within the demand range of T s e t , as indicated by the orange dashed lines. This alignment indicates that the parameters derived from the GA successfully meet the T s e t across various scenarios. Fig. 12a illustrate the optimization results in Zone A, which T s e t range between 9 and 12 °C. Overall, it falls in the T s e t range except for AHU411. In the AHU411 optimization, we observed that its low and medium variations all achieve its T s e t . However, for high variation, 39 % of the data falls higher than its range, higher than 12 °C. The GA has difficulty meet the T s e t , even using the high V O ( j ) , therefore it can be concluded that the AHU411 need more capacity when high variation. Fig. 12b illustrates the Zone B optimization results, in which T s e t ranges between 12.5 and 15.5 °C. The existing parameter already achieves the T s e t , making the GA easy to achieve the T s e t . In this case, since the existing parameter is already optimal, the optimization results confirm their effectiveness. Fig. 12c illustrates the optimization results within Zone C, where the desired T s e t falls within the range of 15∼17 °C. The optimization aligns with the range of T s e t , with the AHU212 exception. Upon analyzing AHU212's optimization, it's noted that low variation consistently meets the T s e t , whereas medium and high variations occasionally deviate from the desired range. Specifically, medium variation shows 27 % of data points above the range and 37 % below, while high variation exhibits 38 % above. This error comes from the inherent challenge encountered by the GA in identifying optimal parameters. Subsequent analysis highlights the model sensitivity, even the AHU212 model accuracy was good, however, the variation when range of T s a ( j ) remains within the range of T s e t during the training process. Fig. 12d illustrates the Zone B optimization results, where T s e t ranges between 16.5 and 18.5 °C. Overall, the results fall within the T s e t range, demonstrating the effectiveness of the optimization process effectiveness. Table 4 presents the percentage of data within the T s e t across four zones (A, B, C, D). The actual and predicted data for zones A, B, and C show the same percentage falling within T s e t . However, zone D exhibits about a 5 % difference because much of the data in Zone 3 is close to maximum T s e t , so a slight error in Celsius significantly impacts this percentage. Overall, the optimization indicates improvement across all zones, demonstrating that our validated approach can maintain temperatures within T s e t , with 96 % of the data overall falling within this range. Fig. 13 illustrates the power consumption for the optimized model, the actual system, and the predicted values. The data reveals that the optimized power consumption is sometimes higher than both the actual and predicted values. This discrepancy is primarily due to the overall load being higher in the optimized scenarios, particularly when the T s a ( j ) reaches significantly lower levels than in the actual system. This indicates that the optimization process, while effective in achieving lower T s a ( j ) , sometimes results in increased P due to the higher cooling demands. The average chiller power is presented in Table 5 . Overall, the power consumption increased by 41 %. Increasing power consumption in this case is necessary to achieve the optimal T s a ( j ) . Although the GA parameters meet the temperature demands and already minimize power in the objective function, they also lead to higher energy consumption when cooling demands are higher. This suggests that further optimization process refinement may be necessary to balance the temperature control and energy efficiency more effectively. 4.5 Discussion When leveraging the existing data, it is acknowledged that datasets may occasionally lack certain critical parameters, affecting the optimization process accuracy. Although this approach may not achieve a high level of precision, it can still produce significant improvements and provide valuable suggestions or control mechanisms for the AHU. The close alignment between the predicted and actual data for T s a validates the neural network models reliability used. However, AHU411 and AHU212 indicate a need for further optimization, by improving their model. Enhancing these models with more diverse training data or incorporating additional influencing factors could improve prediction accuracy. The clustering analysis provided the AHU operational behavior, where the centroid represents the cluster range in GA's initial condition. By identifying distinct clusters, the optimization process could be more precisely targeted, thereby improving the AHU performance. The greater the number of clusters means that the more initial condition needed to be executed by the GA, resulting in more precisely targeted clustering, however, this more time consuming. This study clustered the T r a into 3 clusters. The GA successfully identified parameter sets that brought the T s a within the desired range across multiple zones. It is important to note that the optimization results were generated based on models where several AHU variables, such as chilled water flowrate, airflow, and original control strategy, were not included. By ignoring these variables, the resulting optimization has limitations, applicable only to the original behavior. Therefore, involving the missing AHU variables to the model would improve the DNN model and generate more reliable optimization results, serving as the initial conditions for the optimization. Overall, the T s e t is much lower than the actual T s a . Therefore, a low T c h w is required to achieve a low T s e t , and a high V c w is needed to release heat from the condenser, thereby minimizing power consumption. Even though minimizing power consumption has been incorporated into the GA objective function, it is almost impossible for the optimized value to be lower than the actual value, as a low T s a leads to an increased cooling load and higher power consumption. This indicates that while energy efficiency is a goal, meeting specific cooling demands may sometimes require higher energy input. This analysis shows that achieving the T s e t requires 41 % more power. Future research could explore balancing these requirements, such as installing the flowrate sensors for each AHU to analyze and compare their cooling loads. 5 Conclusions and future works This study leverages a one-year dataset from a multi-zone building with 18 AHUs and 2 chillers to optimizes the AHUs by integrating the DNN model, clustering analysis, and GA. The primary GA objective was to maintain the desired T s a while minimizing power consumption. (1) The DNN was used to develop 18 models for predicting AHU supply air temperatures and 2 models for predicting chiller power consumption. The models demonstrated high predictive accuracy, where 16 models showing an R2 higher than 0.96. Although 4 models had lower R2 values, their MAE and RMSE values remain below 0.2 °C, which is acceptable for our study. (2) Clustering analysis is applied to categorize the T r a data for each AHU into three clusters: low, medium, and high. The centroid of these clusters served as the initial conditions for the GA optimization process. (3) The GA optimization identified parameter sets, which are the V O , f , T c h w , and V c w , that brought T s a within the desired range for most AHUs. The results suggested that AHU411 requires more capacity during high T r a , and AHU212 needs enhanced model with more diverse training data or additional influencing factors could improve prediction accuracy. (4) The validation revealed that this approach demonstrated improvement across zones, maintaining temperatures within T s e t range, with 96 % of the data overall falling within this range. For the power consumption analysis, achieving T s e t required 41 % higher power input. The integration of the DNN models, clustering analysis, and GA offers a robust framework for optimizing HVAC systems in multi-zone buildings. The GA successfully identifies the optimum parameters, highlighting that improvements are needed for AHU411 and AHU212. Future work should focus on refining the models with more diverse training data, and implementing this approach to others HVAC systems. Additionally, installing chilled water flowrate and airflow sensors for each AHU will allow for detail analysis and comparison of cooling loads, further improving the optimization process.

        "dc:description": "Optimizing air handling units (AHUs) in multi-zone buildings presents significant challenges. As buildings become more complex, the demand for tailored temperature control across various zones becomes paramount. This study leverages multi-zone building data with machine learning-based models and optimization techniques to optimize AHUs by specifically integrating deep neural network (DNN) modeling, clustering analysis, and a genetic algorithm (GA). We developed 18 models to predict AHU supply air temperature ( T s a ) and 2 models to predict chiller power consumption ( P ) using DNN. Clustering analysis was applied to the return air temperature ( T r a ) of each AHU, serving as initial conditions for the GA. The clustering analysis provided insights into the AHU operational behavior, enhancing the optimization process precision. The GA's objective function maintained the AHUs' T s a and minimized P by adjusting parameters such as valve openings, fan frequencies, chilled water supply temperature, and cooling water flowrate. The results indicated that DNN models demonstrated high predictive accuracy, with 16 models showing an R2 higher than 0.96. The results suggested that AHU411 requires increased capacity during high T r a condition, while AHU212 needs an enhanced model with more diverse training data or the incorporation of additional influencing factors. Validation revealed that this approach improved temperature maintenance across zones, with 96 % of the data falling within demand temperature range ( T s e t ), and achieving T s e t required 41 % higher power input.",
