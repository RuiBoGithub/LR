Model free based DRL control strategies have achieved positive effects on the HVAC system optimal control. However, developing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) control strategies for different building HVAC systems is time-consuming and laborious. To address this issue, this study proposes a transfer learning and deep reinforcement learning (TL-DRL) integrated framework to achieve the DRL control strategy transfer in the building HVAC system level. Deep Q-learning (DQN) is first pre-trained in the source building until it converges to an optimal strategy. Then, the well pre-trained DQN parameters of the first few layers are transferred to the target DQN. Finally, the target DQN parameters of the last few layers are fine-tuned in the target building. An EnergyPlus-Python co-simulation testbed is developed to investigate the cross temporal-spatial transferability of DQN control strategy in the building HVAC system level. Results indicate that the proposed TL-DRL framework can effectively improve the training efficiency of control strategy by about 13.28% when transferring the first two layers compared to that of the DRL baseline models trained from scratch, while simultaneously maintaining energy consumption and indoor air temperature in an acceptable range. The proposed TL-DRL framework provides a preliminary direction for the scalability of intelligent HVAC control strategies.

Rising energy costs have promoted the development of advanced HVAC energy conversation measures, such as demand response strategy [4,5], renewable energy utilization [6,7], and intelligent HVAC system control strategy [8\u201310]. Among them, studies have shown that inefficient HVAC system control methods can lead to 15%\u201330% energy waste in the building sector [9,11]. Therefore, it is necessary to develop more efficient and smarter strategies for HVAC system optimal control to minimize the building energy consumption while maintaining indoor thermal comfort. Currently, HVAC system control strategies mostly focus on rule-based and model-based methods [9,12]. The ruled-based methods require the least modeling effort because they mainly use a set of expert rules to execute control actions. However, the rule-based methods generally fail to obtain an optimal system control performance. The model-based methods typically construct a model to capture the building thermal dynamics. The commonly used model predictive control (MPC) based methods predict the future state of the finite time domain through the system model and obtain the optimal control sequence. MPC based methods have been widely studied for the optimal control of building HVAC systems, as they have a certain significance for the energy saving of HVAC system operation [13\u201315]. However, model-based control methods need to construct the system model and are highly dependent on the model accuracy. When the model is not accurate enough to describe the system thermal dynamics, the control effect may seriously deviate from the expectations. In addition, model-based control methods are difficult to be reused and need to be remodeled, which greatly increases the modeling effort and time. Model-free control methods such as reinforcement learning (RL) can be used to greatly reduce modeling effort and improve model reusability of HVAC system control. Fig. 1 shows the modeling effort and reusability of different HVAC system control methods. RL based control methods automatically learn the optimal control actions by interacting with the environment. This effectively avoids the complex modeling effort suffered by model-based control methods. As the good transferability of neural networks, some DRL methods that combine deep learning and RL have been successfully applied to HVAC system control problems. Wei et al. [16] proposed a DQN approach for optimal control of airflow rate in a variable air volume (VAV) system. Zhang et al. [17] presented an Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic (A3C) strategy for supply water temperature setpoint control and deployed the A3C control strategy in a real radiant heating system. Biemann et al. [18] conducted experiments with the actor-critic method for zone setpoint temperature and fan mass flow rate control. Valladares et al. [19] proposed a DQN method for indoor temperature setpoint and fan on or off control. Brandi et al. [20] performed experiments to evaluate the adaptability of deep-Q-learning algorithm for supply temperature setpoint control. Zou et al. [21] designed a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) framework for optimal control of damper position, heating valve status, and fan speed in air handling units. These DRL based control algorithms have achieved good performance for HVAC system optimal control and show great potential. However, the learning process of DRL control strategy requires continuous exploration of the environment to effectively obtain the optimal control actions. Repeated training to develop DRL controls for different building HVAC systems is time-consuming. When the HVAC system or the control scenario is complex, studies have shown that DRL control strategies should be trained for several months to achieve better performance. It is unrealistic to directly deploy the DRL control strategy to the actual HVAC system and explore from scratch. In addition, the repetitive training of DRL control strategy for different building HVAC systems is also laborious. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the training and utilization efficiency of the DRL control strategy in the building HVAC system level. Transfer learning is to transfer the knowledge learned from a source task to another related target task, and it is a feasible way to speed up the training process of the DRL control agent with the transferability advantage of neural networks. Due to this advantage, transfer learning based methods have been widely used in the field of building energy prediction [22\u201326], thermal comfort prediction [27\u201329], HVAC fault detection [30,31], power grid rescheduling [32], and achieve some positive effect in these application scenarios. Transfer learning provides a theoretical basis to achieve the HVAC system control strategy transfer. By integrating transfer learning with DRL control strategy, the training time of DRL control strategy in new scenarios can be effectively shortened, thus improving the training efficiency of DRL control strategy. From the literature review, there are few studies on the investigation of transfer learning for DRL based HVAC system control. Xu et al. [33] proposed a DRL based transfer learning framework for airflow rate control. Experiments on different scenarios were conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed transfer learning framework. Lissa et al. [34] applied transfer learning to DRL based heat pump control to speed up the convergence process. Results show the proposed method can effectively reduce the training time to obtain the near-optimal DRL control policy. Nagarathinam et al. [35] presented a Multi-Agent RL control approach for temperature setpoint control agent transfer between different chillers and air handling units (AHUs) with transfer learning. Results show the proposed method improves the learning efficiency during the training period. However, most transfer learning studies on the DRL based HVAC system control only consider the optimal control of a single air side (e.g. AHU) or the water side (e.g. chiller). The space dimensions of DQN control actions for the jointly optimal control of AHUs and chillers would be greatly increased, then the convergence and transfer difficulty of DRL cross different building HVAC systems would be also greatly increased. Therefore, it is necessary to systematically investigate the cross temporal-spatial transferability of DRL based control strategy when jointly optimizing AHUs and chillers in the building HVAC system level. Motivated by the above concern, this study proposes a transfer learning and deep reinforcement learning (TL-DRL) integrated framework that considers both the optimal control of AHUs and chillers, and investigates the transferability of DRL based system control strategy. An EnergyPlus-Python co-simulation testbed is developed to investigate the cross temporal-spatial transferability of DQN control strategy in the building HVAC system level. Simulation results indicate that the proposed TL-DRL framework can effectively improve the DRL training efficiency and achieve the DRL control strategy transfer in the building HVAC system level when transferring the first two layers. The proposed TL-DRL framework provides preliminary direction for the scalability and transfer of advanced intelligent HVAC control strategies. 2 Methodology 2.1 Reinforcement learning based control model for building HVAC system DRL methods have been successfully applied to HVAC system control problems. The performance of DQN for building HVAC system control has been demonstrated in some studies [36\u201338]. Therefore, DQN is used for HVAC system control in this study. DQN updates its policy based on the cumulative reward defined in Equation (1). DQN uses the state-action value function Q(s, a) to evaluate the expected reward of state-action. The state-action value Q(s, a) also called Q value is calculated by Equation (2). (1) G t = ∑ i = 0 ∞ γ i r t + i + 1 (2) Q ( s t , a t ) = E ( G t | s t , a t ) = E ( ∑ i = 0 ∞ γ i r t + i + 1 | s t , a t ) = r t + 1 + γ Q ( s t + 1 , a t + 1 ) where r t + i+1 is the reward at time t + i + 1, γ is the discount factor between (0, 1). According to the Bellman optimal equation, the maximum Q value Q * ( s t , a t ) can be estimated by Equation (3). Then, the Q value of DQN can be updated by Equation (4). (3) Q * ( s t , a t ) = r t + 1 + γ max Q ( s t + 1 , a t + 1 ) (4) Q ( s t , a t ) ← Q ( s t , a t ) + α [ r t + γ max Q ( s t + 1 , a t + 1 ) − Q ( s t , a t ) ] DQN uses a deep Q network Q ( s , a ; θ ) to approximate the Q values. DQN based control model for building HVAC systems consists of environment, agent, action (A = {a 1 , a 2 , a 3 , \u2026, a t , \u2026}), reward (R = {r 1 , r 2 , r 3 , \u2026, r t , \u2026}), and state (S = {s 1 , s 2 , s 3 , \u2026, s t , \u2026}). The building HVAC system (e.g. building, AHU and chiller) is regarded as the Environment , the DQN control strategy is regarded as the control agent . The system state, action space and reward function can be designed as follows. ● Action space: The control action of DQN agent is the supply air temperature (T sa_set ) and chilled supply water temperature setpoint (T csw_set ). T sa_set = {12 °C, 13 °C, 14 °C, 15 °C, 16 °C, 17 °C, 18 °C}, T csw_set = {6 °C, 6.5 °C, 7 °C, 7.5 °C, 8 °C, 8.5 °C, 9 °C}. As the HVAC system of this study includes three AHUs, and there are three supply air temperature setpoints. Then the action space A = T sa_set × T sa_set × T sa_set × T csw_set . ● State space: In this study, indoor environment state parameters (occupancy O cc and indoor air temperature T in ), outdoor environment state parameters (outdoor air temperature T out and direct solar radiation S out ), HVAC system operating state parameters (supply air temperature setpoint T sa_set and chilled supply water temperature setpoint T csw_set ), form the state space S = [O cc , T in , T out , S out , T sa_set , T csw_set ]. ● Reward function: Two terms related to energy consumption of HVAC system and indoor air temperature are regarded as the reward function. The energy related term is the total energy consumption of HVAC system devices, temperature related term is the cumulative violations of indoor air temperature deviated from the cooling temperature setpoint. The reward function r t works like a penalty, when inappropriate control actions are performed and the state deviates from the acceptable range, more energy and temperature penalties will be added to the reward function. The reward function decreases with the increase of energy consumption of HVAC system and the indoor air temperature violations. The reward function can be designed as: (5) r t = f ( e n e r g y , t e m p e r a t u r e ) = { λ ( 1 − E t ) − β ∑ i = 1 15 | T i t − T s e t | ) | O c c = 1 0 | O c c = 0 (6) E t = E c h i l l e r ( t ) + E f a n ( t ) + E p u m p ( t ) Where E t represents the total energy consumption of HVAC system devices (chiller, fan and pump) at time t, E chiller (t), E fan (t), E pump (t) represent the energy consumption of chiller, fan and pump at time t, respectively. T i t represents the indoor air temperature of zone i at time t. T set represents the cooling temperature setpoint. λ, β represent weight coefficients of energy and temperature related terms, respectively. Occ represents the occupancy, the occupancy is set to 1 from Monday to Saturday between 8:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. and the other time is set to 0. 2.2 Transfer learning for DQN control strategy Repeated training to develop DRL control strategies in new scenarios (e.g. buildings, climate zones, systems) is time-consuming and laborious. The well pre-trained DQN control strategy can be transferred to the target DQN with transfer learning methods, which effectively solves the issue of target DQN trained from scratch. Fig. 2 shows the transfer schematic of DQN based building HVAC control strategy. By integrating transfer learning into DQN control strategy, the training time of DQN control strategy in new scenarios can be effectively shortened, thus improving the DRL training efficiency. DQN uses deep neural networks to approximate the Q values and execute the action based on the maximum Q values of the candidate state-action pairs. The effectiveness of fine-tune based transfer learning methods has also been verified in some studies [39,40], therefore fine-tune is used to transfer the well pre-trained source DQN parameters to the target DQN. Supposed the source DQN parameters are w = [ w s1 , w s2 , w s3 , w s4 ] and b = [ b s1 , b s2 , b s3 , b s4 ], and the target DQN parameters are w = [ w s1 , w s2 , w s3 , w T4 ] and b = [ b s1 , b s2 , b s3 , b T4 ]. Then the process of transferring the first three layers can be expressed as follows: (7) S ource : { Y S 1 = R e L u ( w S 1 ⋅ X + b S 1 ) Y S 2 = R e L u ( w S 2 ⋅ Y S 1 + b S 2 ) Y S 3 = R e L u ( w S 3 ⋅ Y S 2 + b S 3 ) Y S 4 = R e L u ( w S 4 ⋅ Y S 3 + b S 4 ) (8) T a r g et : { Y S 1 = R e L u ( w S 1 ⋅ X + b S 1 ) Y S 2 = R e L u ( w S 2 ⋅ Y S 1 + b S 2 ) Y S 3 = R e L u ( w S 3 ⋅ Y S 2 + b S 3 ) Y T 4 = R e L u ( w T 4 ⋅ Y S 3 + b T 4 ) where X represents the input and Y represents the output of each layer. ReLu is the activation function. 2.3 Proposed TL-DRL framework of building HVAC control strategy By integrating transfer learning into DRL control strategy, the training time of DRL control strategy in new scenarios (e.g. buildings, climate zones, systems) can be effectively shortened, thus improving the training efficiency of DRL control strategy. In this study, fine-tuned based transfer learning methods are applied to transfer the well pre-trained source DQN parameters to the target DQN, the proposed TL-DRL framework for building HVAC control strategy transfer is shown in Fig. 3 (schematic example of transferring all three layers). The whole framework contains the following three steps. (1) Source DQN parameters are randomly initialized. DQN is pre-trained in the source building until it converges to an optimal strategy and saves the well pre-trained source DQN parameters. (2) The well pre-trained DQN parameters of the first few layers are transferred to the target DQN. (3) The target DQN parameters of the last few layers are fine-tuned in the target building. The main TL-DRL algorithm flowchart is shown in Fig. 4 . The training process of DQN aims to optimize parameters learned by the DQN control agent. At the beginning of DQN training process, the DQN control agent interacts with the environment and executes actions randomly, then exploit the learned policy after the cumulative rewards converge to a stable value. When the experience memory M = {S, A, R} has stored enough experience, the DQN agent starts to update the parameter. The DQN parameter is trained with the mini-batch {s 1 , r 1 , a 1 , \u2026, s t , r t , a t , \u2026} stored in M. The training process is to minimize the error between the target Q values of Q ˆ ( s , a ; θ − ) network and estimated Q values of Q ( s , a ; θ ) network. Among them, the parameters θ − of Q ˆ ( s , a ; θ − ) network are copied by the parameters θ of Q ( s , a ; θ ) network every m days. Mean square error between the target Q-values in Equation (9) and the estimated Q-values of Q ( s , a ; θ ) network are defined as the loss function in Equation (10). DQN parameters are updated by the gradient descent method by Equation (11). (9) Q ˆ * ( s t , a i , t ; θ − ) = r t + 1 + γ max Q ˆ ( s t + 1 , a i , t + 1 ; θ − ) (10) L oss = 1 N ∑ i = 1 N [ Q ˆ * ( s t , a i , t ; θ − ) − Q ( s t , a i , t ; θ ) ] 2 (11) θ = θ − α ∂ L oss ∂ θ Where N represents the number of batch size, α represent the learning rate. θ, θ-respectively represent the weight and bias parameters of target Q ˆ ( s , a ; θ − ) network and estimated Q ( s , a ; θ ) network. 2.4 Performance evaluation metrics of the proposed TL-DRL framework To evaluate the transferability of DRL control strategy from the source building to the target building, some performance evaluation metrics are defined to quantitative the transferability in this study. According to Refs. [41,42], three performance evaluation metrics are used to evaluate the transferability of DQN control strategy, including robustness, DQN training efficiency and control performance. ● Robustness : The standard deviation values of cumulative rewards, energy consumption, and temperature violations are taken as the metric to evaluate the robustness of DQN control strategy during the training process. To ensure the reliability of the results, the mean and standard deviation values are calculated from the 20th episode of the training process. The calculation equations are expressed as follows: (12) { μ R = ∑ i = k k + N R i / N σ R = ∑ i = k k + N ( R i − μ R ) 2 / N (13) { μ E = ∑ i = k k + N E i / N σ E = ∑ i = k k + N ( E i − μ E ) 2 / N (14) { μ T = ∑ i = k k + N T i / N σ T = ∑ i = k k + N ( T i − μ T ) 2 / N where, μ R , μ E , μ T respectively represent the mean values of cumulative rewards, energy consumption and temperature violations of each episode. б R , б E , б T respectively represent the standard deviation of cumulative rewards, energy consumption and temperature violations of each episode. R i , E i , T i respectively represent the value of cumulative rewards, energy consumption and temperature violations of each episode. k is 20 and N is 30 in this study. ● DQN training efficiency : The average DQN training time (τ) of each episode is defined as the DQN training efficiency during the training process. ● Control performance : The control performance is defined as the average energy consumption (E c ) of the HVAC system and average temperature violations (T c ) of each simulation step during the testing process after the training process is over. 2.5 Overall flowchart of this study The overall flowchart of this study is conducted as the following four steps shown in Fig. 5 . Step 1: Development of DQN based HVAC control strategy. The first step is to develop the DQN based HVAC control strategy. The main work is to define the environment, agent, state, control actions and reward function of DQN control model. The detailed descriptions of the development of DQN based HVAC control strategy are provided in Section2.1. Step 2: TL-DRL framework for building HVAC control strategy transfer. The proposed TL-DRL framework is used to transfer the well pre-trained DQN parameters to the target DQN. Details of this step are described in Section 2.3 . Step 3: Experiment and DQN hyper-parameter settings. Experiments including three different transfer scenarios (i.e. Scenario # 1: AU-DE and HO-DE, Scenario # 2: AU-HO and DE-HO, Scenario # 3: HO-AU and DE-AU) are conducted. The training process is used to determine the near optimal DQN hyper-parameter. The details are provided in Section 3.2 and Section 3.3 . Step 4: Transferability evaluation of DQN control strategy. The final step is to investigate the transferability of DQN based control strategy in the building HVAC system level cross three different cities. Detailed results and analysis are discussed in Section 3.4 and Section 3.5 . 3 Results and discussions 3.1 Simulation environment In this study, the building and HVAC system is modeled by the EnergyPlus software [43]. As some advanced control algorithms such as DRL can't be directly implemented in EnergyPlus, the DQN based HVAC system control algorithm is implemented by Python. An EnergyPlus-Python co-simulation testbed based on Functional Mock-Up Interface (FMI) standard is developed to complete the whole simulation process [44\u201346]. The detailed co-simulation implementation process can be founded in our previous study [47]. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) developed some commercial reference models for building energy simulation [48]. These reference models have been widely used for building energy efficiency [49\u201351] and HVAC control analysis [12,52]. The 3D SketchUp multi-zone building model used for co-simulation is shown in Fig. 6 . The large office reference buildings cross three different cities are selected for analysis: (1) Denver (DE); (2) Houston (HO); (3) Austin (AU). Amon them, HO and AU are from climate zone #2, DE is from climate zone #5 according to the climate zone classification system in Ref. [48]. The large office reference building is severed for summer refrigeration by the multi-zone VAV system, including the chilled water system, cooling water system, and AHU. The typical VAV system involves many controllable parameters, including the temperature setpoint, and the supply air volume flow. The chillers and AHU fans account for about 80% of the HVAC system energy consumption, so we focus on the setpoint optimal control of chilled supply water temperature and AHU supply air temperature in this study. The indoor cooling temperature is set to 24 °C and the HVAC system operates from 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. Figs. 7 and 8 show the outdoor air temperature and direct solar radiation during July and August of the three different cities. It can be seen that the direct solar radiation of DE, HO and AU all have similar distributions in July and August, while the outdoor air temperature distribution of DE is different from that of HO and AU. This is mainly because HO and AU are in the same climate zone and DE is in another climate zone. 3.2 Experiment settings In this study, all experiments are conducted on an Intel Xeon(R) Gold 6226R processor with 128 GB RAM and a GeForce RTX 3090 GPU. Experiments are conducted to evaluate the transferability of DRL control strategy in the building HVAC system level, the detailed performance evaluation and result analysis are described in Section 3.4 . Experiments setting are shown in Fig. 9 , the following simulation experiments including three different transfer scenarios are conducted: ● Scenario # 1: Transfer learning models from AU and HO to DE: AU-DE and HO-DE. ● Scenario # 2: Transfer learning models from AU and DE to HO: AU-HO and DE-HO. ● Scenario # 3: Transfer learning models from HO and DE to AU: HO-AU and DE-AU. Studies have demonstrated that the front layers of deep neural networks trained on a source domain can be transferred to other similar target domains to improve the training efficiency. The first few layers of deep neural networks can be used as a feature extractor to extract universal features, and the deeper layers will gradually extract specific features. DQN agent of the proposed TL-DRL framework has four layers, transferring the different number of layers has great effects on the transfer performance. Therefore, the transfer performance of transferring the first layer ( # TL-1 ), transferring the first two layers ( # TL-2 ) and transferring the first three layers ( # TL-3 ) are discussed in our study. All the transfer learning models are compared with the three DRL baseline models (DE, HO and AU) trained from scratch. The whole simulation process includes the training process and testing process. The training process is from July 1st to July 31st, and the testing process is from August 1st to August 31st. The control period is set from Monday to Saturday between 8:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. The proposed TL-DRL framework aims to improve the DRL training efficiency, simultaneously maintaining the energy consumption and indoor air temperature in an acceptable range. 3.3 DQN hyper-parameter settings The near optimal model hyper-parameters should be first determined during the DQN training process to obtain an optimal control performance in the deployment phase (i.e. testing process). We consider both the convergence robustness and control performance of the DQN strategy when we determine the near optimal model hyper-parameters. The convergence robustness is evaluated by the cumulative rewards of the whole simulation process, and the control performance is evaluated by the average energy consumption and average temperature violations of each simulation step in the final DQN training episode. As the weight coefficients of energy and temperature related terms have great effects on the convergence robustness and control performance, we focus on discussing the effect of these two key hyper-parameters with different configurations. Fig. 10 shows the cumulative rewards of the two key hyper-parameters with different configurations for the three DQN baseline models during the DQN training process. It can be seen that the cumulative rewards of the two key hyper-parameters with different configurations fluctuate greatly during the training episodes. The smaller the fluctuation of the cumulative rewards during the training episodes, the better the convergence robustness with this parameter configuration. The DQN control strategy can be considered stable when the cumulative rewards fluctuate slightly after some training episodes. In addition, it should be noted that we cannot determine the hyper-parameter by the absolute reward values as the reward values vary greatly with the two weight coefficients. We calculate the standard deviation of the reward values to compare the convergence robustness. Meanwhile, we also should consider the control performance of the DQN strategy when determining the hyper-parameters. Fig. 11 shows the DQN control performance of these two key hyper-parameters with different configurations during the training process, in a four-quadrant visualization considering the average energy consumption and average temperature violations of each simulation step for the three DRL baseline models. The black dashed line denotes the minimum value of the average energy consumption and average temperature violations. The intersection of the two dashed lines can be seen as the optimal performance point by the DQN control strategy of the two key hyper-parameters with different configurations. The dots near the intersection can be regarded as the near optimal control region. The optimal hyper-parameters are determined by both the convergence robustness and control performance of the DQN strategy. The convergence robustness is determined by the results of Fig. 10. The convergence robustness shows better performance when the rewards can keep stable as the episode increases. The control performance is determined by the results of Fig. 11. The control performance is better when the strategy can maintain both the energy consumption and temperature in a lower level (the red dot is near the intersection of two black dashed lines in Fig. 11). Based on the convergence robustness of cumulative rewards, the control performance of average energy consumption and average temperature violations, these two near optimal hyper-parameters (i.e. weight coefficient of energy and temperature related terms) of the three DRL baseline models can be respectively determined as (3, 2), (2, 1) and (1, 2). Other hyper-parameters are determined based on reference and trial and error [19,20,47]. The final selected hyper-parameters used for DQN training are listed in Table 1 . Figs. 12\u201314 respectively show the cumulative rewards, average energy consumption and average temperature violations of each step during the 50 training episodes for the three DRL baseline models with the selected hyper-parameters. It can be seen that the cumulative rewards show an increasing trend, while the average energy consumption and average temperature violations show a decreasing trend with the training episodes going on. These results are in line with the learning process of DRL, as the reward increase with the decrease of energy consumption and temperature violations. Results show that the DQN control agent gradually learns to reduce energy consumption while maintaining a better thermal comfort with the training episodes going on. The cumulative rewards, average energy consumption and average temperature violations all gradually converge to a stable value after some training episodes. It can be seen that the cumulative rewards increase to 69, 41 and 18, the average energy consumption decreases to about 44 kWh, 57 kWh and 57 kWh, and the average temperature violations decrease to 14 °C, 15 °C and 8 °C after ten training episodes respectively. They all remain small fluctuations around these values in the subsequent training episodes. The DQN control strategy shows a powerful learning capability to maintain lower energy consumption and temperature violations by determining the appropriate temperature setpoint. 3.4 Performance evaluation and results analysis of proposed TL-DRL framework The large office reference buildings cross three different cities (climate zones) are selected for analysis: (1) Denver (DE); (2) Houston (HO); (3) Austin (AU). HO and AU are in the same climate zone and DE is in another climate zone. The three scenarios are set to compare the effect of climate zone on the transfer performance of the system control strategy. Each of these three buildings is used as the target building and the other two buildings are used as the source buildings. After the near optimal model hyper-parameters are determined, experiments including three different transfer scenarios (i.e. Scenario # 1: AU-DE and HO-DE, Scenario # 2: AU-HO and DE-HO, Scenario # 3: HO-AU and DE-AU) are conducted to evaluate the transferability of the proposed TL-DRL framework in the building HVAC system level. 3.4.1 Scenario # 1: AU-DE and HO-DE Fig. 15 shows the cumulative rewards, average energy consumption and average temperature violations of AU-DE during the 50 training episodes. It can be seen that the cumulative rewards, average energy consumption and average temperature violations for transferring the different number of layers show great differences. For transferring the first layer (i.e. the TL-1 model), the average energy consumption of AU-DE almost maintains the same as that of the baseline model DE, while the average temperature violations are higher than that of DE. For transferring the first two layers (i.e. the TL-2 model), the cumulative rewards, average energy consumption and average temperature violations of AU-DE almost all maintain the same as that of DE. For transferring the first three layers (i.e. the TL-3 model), the cumulative rewards, average energy consumption and average temperature violations of AU-DE show similar performance compared to that of the TL-2 model. Fig. 16 shows the cumulative rewards, average energy consumption and average temperature violations of HO-DE during the 50 training episodes. For transferring the different number of layers, the average energy consumption and average temperature violations of HO-DE all show worse control performance compared to that of DE during the training process. In addition, the standard deviation values of б R , б E , б T , τ, E c , and T c calculated from the 20th episode of the training process are used to evaluate the robustness of the transfer strategy. Fig. 17 shows the area chart of DQN training time for transferring the different number of layers during the 50 training episodes of AU-DE and HO-DE. It can be seen that the DQN training time of each layer remains relatively stable, except for some fluctuating points. Fig. 18 shows the cumulative counts of DQN training time for transferring the different number of layers during the 50 training episodes. For both AU-DE and HO-DE, it can be seen that the DQN training time of the DRL, TL-1, TL-2 and TL-3 models is respectively maintained at 1.0\u20131.1s, 0.9\u20131.0s, 0.8\u20130.9s, and 0.7\u20130.8s. The DQN training time decreases no matter how many layers are transferred. The proposed TL-DRL framework shows improvements in training efficiency compared to that of the DRL baseline model trained from scratch. In addition, the DQN training time decreases with the number of transferring layers increasing. This is because the more transferring layers there are, the more parameters are frozen and the fewer parameters need to be trained. For AU-DE, the average DQN training time of the DRL, TL-1, TL-2 and TL-3 models is calculated as 1.0407s, 0.9944s, 0.8950s and 0.7294s, and the three TL-DRL models respectively improve the training efficiency by 4.4480%, 14.0018% and 29.9093% compared to that of the DRL baseline model. For HO-DE, the average DQN training time of the TL-1, TL-2 and TL-3 models is calculated as 0.9955s, 0.8992s and 0.7317s, and the three TL-DRL models respectively improve the training efficiency by 4.3478%, 13.5999% and 29.6955% compared to that of the DRL baseline model. In the practical deployment, the training efficiency improved by the proposed TL-DRL strategy is still quite effective. Table 2 shows the detailed transfer performance evaluation metrics of AU-DE. The results show that the TL-2 and TL-3 models show similar robustness and control performance to the baseline model DE, while the DQN training efficiency is significantly improved. The control performance of the TL-1 model is not very good, especially the temperature deviation value of 18.3112 °C is larger than the baseline value of 10.8666 °C. The results show that the control strategy transfer between AU and DE is feasible by transferring the appropriate number of DQN layers. Table 3 shows the detailed transfer performance evaluation metrics of HO-DE. Compared with the baseline model DE, the TL-1, TL-2 and TL-3 models all show worse control performance. The average energy consumption and average temperature violations of HO-DE highly exceed that of the baseline model DE, and results of TL-3 show larger fluctuations. The results reveal that the control strategy transfer between HO and DE is not feasible. These results are also consistent with the previous analysis. 3.4.2 Scenario # 2: AU-HO and DE-HO Fig. 19 shows the cumulative rewards, average energy consumption and average temperature violations of AU-HO during the 50 training episodes. Similarly, it can be seen that the cumulative rewards, average energy consumption and average temperature violations for transferring the different number of layers show great differences. For the TL-1 model, the cumulative rewards, average energy consumption and average temperature violations of AU-HO all show worse performance compared to that of the baseline model HO during the training process. For the TL-2 model, the cumulative rewards, average energy consumption and average temperature violations of AU-HO almost maintain the same level as that of HO. For the TL-3 model, the average energy consumption and average temperature violations of AU-HO show better performance compared to that of HO. The results indicate that the HO baseline model doesn't converge to the optimal control performance and the proposed TL-DRL model can improve the control performance. Fig. 20 shows the cumulative rewards, average energy consumption and average temperature violations of DE-HO during the 50 training episodes. Similar to the AU-HO transfer scenario, the TL-2 model of the DE-HO transfer scenario shows comparable performance compared to that of HO. The average energy consumption of the TL-1 model and the average temperature violations of the TL-3 model both show poor control performance. Fig. 21 shows the area chart of DQN training time for transferring the different number of layers during the 50 training episodes of AU-HO and DE-HO. DQN training time of each layer also remains relatively stable, except for some fluctuating points. Fig. 22 shows the cumulative counts of DQN training time for transferring the different number of layers during the 50 training episodes. For AU-HO, the average DQN training time of the DRL, TL-1, TL-2 and TL-3 models is calculated as 1.0365s, 0.9926s, 0.8865s, and 0.7283s, and the three TL-DRL models respectively improve the training efficiency by 4.2310%, 14.4672% and 29.7322% compared to that of the DRL baseline model. For DE-HO, the average DQN training time of the TL-1, TL-2 and TL-3 models is calculated as 1.0055s, 0.9049s, 0.7359s, and the three TL-DRL models respectively improve the training efficiency by 2.9896%, 12.6960% and 28.9972% compared to that of the DRL baseline model. The percentage of training efficiency improved by the proposed TL-DRL strategy is about 3%\u201329% and is still quite effective. Table 4 shows the detailed transfer performance evaluation metrics of AU-HO. The results show that the TL-3 model shows the best transfer performance considering the transfer performance evaluation metrics, especially the DQN training efficiency and average temperature violations have obvious improvement compared to that of the baseline model HO. The results show that the baseline model HO doesn't achieve the optimal control performance and the proposed TL-DRL strategy can improve the control performance. TL-2 model shows comparable performance compared to that of HO. The control performance of the TL-1 model is not very good, the average energy consumption and average temperature deviations are both larger than the baseline model HO. Table 5 shows the detailed transfer performance evaluation metrics of DE-HO. Compared with the baseline model HO, the TL-1 and TL-3 models both show worse transfer performance. TL-2 model shows the best transfer performance considering the three performance evaluation metrics. 3.4.3 Scenario # 3: HO-AU and DE-AU Fig. 23 shows the cumulative rewards, average energy consumption and average temperature violations of HO-AU during the 50 training episodes. The cumulative rewards, average energy consumption and average temperature violations for transferring the different number of layers show great differences. For the TL-1 and TL-3 models, the average energy consumption and average temperature violations of HO-AU show obvious worse performance compared to that of the baseline model AU. For the TL-2 model, the cumulative rewards, average energy consumption and average temperature violations of HO-AU are slightly higher than that of AU, but still at relatively low levels. Fig. 24 shows the cumulative rewards, average energy consumption and average temperature violations of DE-AU during the 50 training episodes. Similarly, the TL-1 and TL-3 models, the average energy consumption and average temperature violations of HO-AU show obvious worse performance compared to that of AU. For the TL-2 model, the cumulative rewards, average energy consumption and average temperature violations of HO-AU maintain the same as that of AU. Fig. 25 shows the area chart of DQN training time for transferring the different number of layers during the 50 training episodes of HO-AU and DE-AU. DQN training time of each layer remains relatively stable except for some fluctuating points. Fig. 26 shows the cumulative counts of DQN training time for transferring the different number of layers during the 50 training episodes. For HO-AU, the average DQN training time of the DRL, TL-1, TL-2 and TL-3 models is calculated as 1.0319s, 1.0053s, 0.9013s, 0.7295s, and the three TL-DRL models respectively improve the training efficiency by 2.5811%, 12.6536% and 29.3051% compared to that of the DRL baseline model. For DE-AU, the average DQN training time of the TL-1, TL-2 and TL-3 models is calculated as 1.0119s, 0.9053 s, 0.7329s, and the three TL-DRL models respectively improve the training efficiency by 1.9344%, 12.2665% and 28.9792% compared to that of the DRL baseline model. According to the above training time results in the three different transfer scenarios, the average improved percentages of training efficiency of transferring the different numbers of layers are calculated as 3.4220%, 13.2809%, and 29.4364% compared to that of the corresponding baseline models. Table 6 shows the detailed transfer performance evaluation metrics of HO-AU. The results show that, compared with the DRL baseline model, the TL-1 model shows the worst transfer performance considering the robustness, DQN training efficiency and control performance evaluation metrics. TL-2 model shows similar performance compared to that of the DRL baseline model. The control performance of the TL-3 model is not very good, the energy consumption and temperature deviations are both larger than that of the baseline model. Table 7 shows the detailed transfer performance evaluation metrics of DE-AU. Compared with the DRL baseline model, the control performance of the TL-1 and TL-3 models both show worse control performance. TL-2 model shows the best transfer performance considering the three performance evaluation metrics. 3.5 Comprehensive comparisons between the proposed TL-DRL models and DRL baseline models Transferring the different number of neural network layers has great effects on the transfer performance, therefore it is discussed in detail in this study. For transferring the different number of layers, the mean values of б R , б E , б T , τ, E c , and T c of the three different transfer scenarios are used to comprehensively evaluate the transfer performance. All the transfer performance evaluation metrics of TL-DRL models are dimensionless by dividing the values of corresponding DRL baseline models. Meanwhile, the performance evaluation metrics of DRL baseline models are set to 1. The larger the value of the dimensionless transfer performance evaluation metrics, the worse the transfer performance of the TL-DRL models. Fig. 27 shows the comprehensive comparison results between the proposed TL-DRL models and DRL baseline models. It can be seen that the mean values of б R , б T , and T c of the three TL-DRL models (i.e. the TL-1, TL-2 and TL-3 models) all exceed that of DRL baseline model. Amon them, the mean values of б T of the TL-1 and TL-3 models far exceed that of the DRL baseline model, the TL-2 model stills maintain a lower value. For the TL-2 models, only the value of б R is larger. Considering all the transfer performance evaluation metrics comprehensively, the TL-2 model shows the best transfer performance. These results are also interpretable by the deep neural network characteristics. Because the first few layers of the deep neural networks can be used as a feature extractor to extract general features, and the deeper layers gradually extract specific features. Therefore, the transfer performance maybe not be good due to the incomplete general features extracted when transferring the first layer. In addition, only the last layer is fine-tuned when transferring the first three layers. With fewer fine-tuned parameters, the DQN control agent of the TL-3 models executes similar actions to the DQN baseline model. It can achieve a good transfer performance only when the two baseline models have highly similar optimal control actions. In addition, the effect of climate zone on the transfer performance of the system control strategy are also evaluated. The comprehensive comparison results of transfer performance in different and the same climate zones are shown in Fig. 28 . HO and AU are from the same climate zones, the transfer scenarios between them (i.e. HO-AU and AU-HO) can be regarded as transfer between the same climate zone, and other transfer scenarios can be regarded as transfer between different climate zones. The results of different and the same climate zones in the above three transfer scenarios are respectively averaged. Comprehensive comparison of all transfer performance evaluation metrics, it can be seen that the robustness and temperature violations of transfer performance between the same climate zone are significantly better than that of different climate zones. Furthermore, the indoor air temperature of the above three transfer scenarios is also analyzed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed TL-DRL strategy. Fig. 29 shows the indoor air temperature of one zone for the above three transfer scenarios (i.e. six different TL-DRL models) during a week. When the temperature setpoint is stable after the DQN training process is over, indoor air temperature keeps a small fluctuation around the cooling temperature setpoint (i.e. the blue line) during the occupied period (i.e. Occ = 1). These results show that the proposed TL-DRL strategy can effectively improve the DRL training efficiency, simultaneously maintaining the energy consumption and indoor air temperature in an acceptable range in most transfer scenarios. However, the performance of control strategy transfer between different building HVAC systems vary greatly. Some may lead to worse control performance and the similarity of temporal-spatial characteristics between different building HVAC systems should be considered when transferring the system control strategy. 4 Conclusions This study proposes a TL-DRL framework to achieve the DRL control strategy transfer in the building HVAC system level. DQN is first pre-trained in the source building until it converges to an optimal strategy. Then, well pre-trained DQN parameters of the first few layers are transferred to the target DQN. Finally, the target DQN parameters of the last few layers are fine-tuned in the target building. An EnergyPlus-Python co-simulation testbed is developed to investigate the cross temporal-spatial transferability of DQN control strategy in the building HVAC system level. Main conclusions can be obtained as follows: (1) A transfer learning and deep reinforcement learning (TL-DRL) integrated framework is proposed for control strategy transfer of building HVAC system, which can effectively improve the DRL training efficiency in the building HVAC system level. (2) TL-DRL model performance is sensitive to the number of network layers and transferring the different number of layers has great effects on the transfer performance. Transfer performance of transferring the first layer (# TL-1), transferring the first two layers (# TL-2) and transferring the first three layers (# TL-3) are compared with that of DQN baseline models in this study. Comprehensive analysis of the robustness, DQN training efficiency and control performance of transferring the different number of layers, the TL-2 model has the best comprehensive transfer performance. (3) DQN training time decreases with the number of transferring layers increasing. Simulation results indicate that the proposed TL-DRL framework can improve the training efficiency by about 3%\u201329% compared to that of the DRL baseline models trained from scratch. Among the three different transfer learning scenarios, the TL-2 models can improve the training efficiency of control strategy by about 13.28% on average, simultaneously maintaining the energy consumption and indoor air temperature in an acceptable range. (4) The effect of climate zone on the transfer performance of the system control strategy are also evaluated. Comprehensive comparison of all transfer performance evaluation metrics, the robustness and temperature violations of control strategy transfer between the same climate zone are significantly better than that of different climate zones. The DRL control strategy transfer in the building HVAC system level is a very complex problem, there exists some limitation to be improved and studied in the future work. For example, the transfer scenario in this study is the cross temporal-spatial transferability investigation between the same types of building HVAC systems and buildings across different cities (climate zones). The cross temporal-spatial transferability investigation between different types of HVAC systems (e.g. system with different cooling capacities) and buildings (e.g. building with different wall materials) should be further considered. In addition, considering the thermal coupling of building HVAC system, the whole multi-zone building HVAC system can be decomposed into multiple subsystems, and independent DRL agent controller should be set for each subsystem (e.g. AHU and chiller). Then, a multi-agent based DRL control strategy can be formed to achieve more efficient optimal control of building HAVC systems.
