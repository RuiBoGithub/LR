This study is based on the system architecture of the Internet of Things (IoT) Smart House, and presents an application system that uses fuzzy control to efficiently control load devices, in order to provide thermal comfort for indoor environments. This system adopts the scatter layout method to determine the best indoor node for measurement, assesses stability through minimum variation, and reliability through the minimum mean deviation, and uses a questionnaire to discuss whether the experimental data are different from human feelings. In this study, the thermal comfort index is calculated according to the ISO 7730 standard, and two methods, including the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) and Predicted Percentage of Dissatisfied (PPD), are adopted to assess the human perception of thermal comfort in the whole space. There are six kinds of data for assessment, which fall into the categories of environmental factors and personal factors. The data of the environmental factor are air temperature, mean radiant temperature, relative humidity, and air velocity, and the data of the personal factor are clothing insulation, and metabolic. Keywords IoT Smart House Fuzzy control Thermal comfort index 1 Introduction The rapid developments of science and technology have changed daily life tremendously within just the last decade; however, such developments have also led to environmental degradation and the frequent occurrence of abnormal climate. The climate change of this era is so prominent that even climatologists have said that the abnormal point of climate has arrived, and that the models based on the previous climate change rate can no longer be used to predict or tell the future climate. The preoccupation with climate change in recent years can also be perceived in movies themed with the destruction of the world caused by abnormal climate, which intend to alert the world against climate change. In the case of Taiwan, the current discussion on climate issues involves various terminologies, such as \u201csaint-baby phenomenon\u201d and \u201canti-saint-baby phenomenon\u201d, from which you can clearly perceive climate change in Taiwan without understanding the meaning of these terminologies; for example, the heat of summer and the chill of winter, and even the domination of the summer climate for a whole year. In order to enjoy the hard-won leisure time in life, people purchase a variety of electrical appliances, such as air conditioners and water-cooled fans. However, with a large number of electrical appliances, people should consider whether such appliances meet their expectation, and whether their indoor environment is comfortable or not [1]. This study devises a thermal comfort control system based on the IoT Smart House System, assesses and analyzes the node for indoor environment measurement, determines the fuzzy control rules according to the experimental data, and conducts a questionnaire survey to summarize the paper. This study intends to efficiently control device loads in indoor environments, in order that people can perceive good thermal comfort when indoors, thus, enabling them to enjoy their leisure time in life. A comfortable environment for rest improves the quality of life and enhances human vitality, thus, people can be physically and mentally prepared for new challenges every day. This study analyzes indoor environment data through the scatter layout method, and determines the node for measurement through the minimum variation and minimum mean deviation. When the data deviation of a node for measurement is excessively huge, it is difficult to stabilize system control; by contrast, when the data deviation is mild, the effect of control is good and the system is more stable. When there is huge difference between the data of the node for measurement and the data of the overall environment, the data of this node fails to accurately reflect the overall indoor environment; by contrast, when the difference is mild, the reliability of this node in the overall indoor environment is much higher. The minimum variation and minimum mean deviation represent the stability and reliability of the node for measurement, respectively. This study discusses the thermal comfort of indoor environments through the Smart House System architecture, and adopts fuzzy control in a Smart House to properly operate the devices in the indoor environment, in order to provide thermal comfort for indoor environments. This study adopts the scatter layout to measure the data of three nodes in an indoor environment to ensure the stability and reliability of the data of the overall indoor environment. The nodes are equipped with sensors for temperature, humidity, wind speed, CO2 and PM. When the sensors receive data, they are processed and integrated through an Arduino Mega 2560 chip, and then, transmitted to the computer via ZigBee. On the computer end, this study uses Visual Studio C# software as the human-machine monitoring interface, calculates the thermal comfort index, analyses whether the concentration of CO2 and PM is normal according to the data, and stores the results in Microsoft Excel database as the basis for subsequent control and analysis [2,3]. This study also adopts fuzzy control to analyze the state of load initiation, in order that the effect of thermal comfort control is achieved. The load devices include air conditioner, humidifier, and electrical fan. There are six reference parameters for the thermal comfort index: air temperature, mean radiant temperature, relative humidity, air velocity, clothing insulation, metabolic, air temperature, relative humidity, and air velocity, which are all expressed with their real values. Mean radiant temperature is assumed to be air temperature, while metabolic and clothing insulation are assumed as 0.6 clo and 1.2 met, respectively. 2 Literature review 2.1 Internet of things (IoT) and Smart House The main concept of IoT is \u201cthe integration of virtuality and reality and the interconnection of all things\u201d, which can also be understood as the phenomenon that all things in the world, whether \u201chumans\u201d, \u201cthings\u201d, \u201ctime\u201d, \u201clocations\u201d, or \u201cobjects\u201d, can be interconnected by the Internet. ETSI defines the IoT as a three-layer hierarchy, each of which is inextricably linked with its own functions. These three layers are sensor, network, and application, as shown and explained in Fig. 1 [8], as follows: (1) Sensor Layer: This layer is composed of components capable of sensing, monitoring, and identifying, and is mainly responsible for the establishment of information, such as RFID, temperature, and humidity sensors. (2) Network Layer: This layer is composed of components capable of communication and transmission. The information is transmitted to corresponding devices for communication and exchange in a wired or wireless manner, such as TCP/IP, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. (3) Application Layer: This layer mainly consists of hardware devices, which process information accordingly in a tangible or intangible manner. In terms of the tangible manner, information is displayed on computer software interfaces to allow users to know the current situation and progress, enabling them to process and act accordingly. In terms of the intangible manner, if the temperature is too high, the air conditioner will be turned on and the temperature will be set at 26\u202f°C, preventing users from feeling uncomfortable due to high temperature. The IoT has evolved from the initial P2P to P2M, and then, to M2M, and while it has been widely applied in life, the IoT still faces many difficulties and challenges. At present, problems are encountered at all levels, as follows: (1) Sensor Layer: IoT is so extensible that many different devices can be connected to it, each of which processes data in different ways. If there is no standard for reception, processing, or format, the efficiency of IoT can never be improved [4\u20136]. (2) Network Layer: At present, the transmission of IoT is mainly wireless, and because wired transmission is very restricted, very few people want to use it. However, wireless transmission also encounters problems, such as architecture, frequency band, anti-interference, security, and efficiency, which cannot be solved with a standardized method. A unified standard in the future will be key to the success of the popularization of the IoT [7,8]. (3) Application Layer: The development of the IoT brings about big data, such as data accuracy, the frequency of application use, and individual preferences. In the era of information explosion, how to process, analyze, and predict data efficiently will enhance the value of data, and prevent the value from depreciation over time. If IoT can achieve self-planning, self-analysis, self-prediction, and self-repair, it will mark another milestone. The concept of AI seen in movies is not just an idea, but something that can be materialized. IBM proposed the \u201cSmart Planet\u201d in 2008, which is one of the ambitious goals for IoT that attracted great attention from many countries in 2009. U.S President Barack Obama took it as one of the national development strategies; the European Union also proposed the i2010 plan; Japan launched the initiatives of E-Japan, U-Japan, and I-Japan; China initiated the plan of Reading China [9]. While such ideas are inspiring, they are difficult to implement due to political, technical, and financial barriers. Political decision-making is shared by different stakeholders, and to solve this problem, a specialized department must be established to institutionalize decision-making, implementation, and management. The technical problem lies in heterogeneous technology, and to address this issue, we must create a complete architecture, and unify or design platforms for information transmission and communication. To solve the financial problem, we need a clear business model for good operation and management, which can start with easy-to-use applications to shatter the stalemate, in order that society and investors perceive the noticeable return on investment, thus, facilitating the extension to other applications [10\u201312]. When more and more sensing and driving devices are installed in an area, a transitional period will occur, and qualitative changes will take place, namely, the evolution of a \u201cSmart Planet\u201d [13]. According to The Zero Marginal Cost Society by Jeremy Rifkin, globally, approximately 10 million sensors were used in IoT in 2007; this figure soared to roughly 3.5 billion by 2013; in by 2030, it is estimated that there will be 100 trillion sensors applied to the IoT [14]. Therefore, this study takes the application of an IoT Smart House as a catalyst to contribute to IoT, in order to meet the expectation of a \u201cSmart City\u201d and even the great ideal of a \u201cSmart Planet\u201d. Many studies have focused on Smart Houses with the shared idea of comfortable and safe living spaces. In particular, with the improvements of technical value, domain compatibility, technology sharing, and R&D innovation in recent years, research regarding the Smart House has been more extensive, and covers a wide range of fields, such as environmental assessment, transmission improvement, and even architectural design. As the research becomes more extensive, more topics, indicators, standards, laws, and regulations have been generated. In 1972, P.O. Fanger proposed the equation of human thermal balance to assess the thermal comfort of people in indoor environments [15], which was applicable to various standards, such as ASHRAE 55 and ISO 7730; in 1982, WHO published a study on the Sick Building Syndrome (SBS) [16]; in 2010, WHO issued an indoor air guide, in which selected pollutants were shown to readers [17]. ASHRAE, AHAM, EP, and OSHA have established relevant provisions applicable to their own field. The U.S. government has also coined the index of Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) according to references given by multiple parties; however, this index is merely intended to draw the attention of owners without being implemented compulsorily [18]. The above discussions show that countries around the world have their own main research topics. Although there is no express law or regulation for the Smart House, many scholars have used relevant information to study and design Smart Houses to create a prototype with clear outline. This author believes that the progressive contributions made by these scholars will definitely break new ground for the Smart House in the immediate future [19,20]. 2.2 Temperature and humidity The sun is the main source of thermal energy in nature. It irradiates the earth and water to produce a water cycle, which makes the evolution of life possible. The most suitable temperature for the human body in an indoor environment is roughly 18\u202f°C to 24\u202f°C, and the most suitable humidity is roughly 45% to 65%. The body temperature of an ordinary person generally reaches the lowest between 2 and 5 a.m. and the highest between 5 and 7p.m., ranging from 36 to 37\u202f°C with a difference of roughly 1\u202f°C. The average body temperature of females is approximately 0.3\u202f°C higher than that of males. When the body temperature fails to reach the thermal balance, the body will have abnormal reactions, such as hypothermia, heatstroke, heat exhaustion, and heat spasm; hypothermia may occur when the body temperature is below 35\u202f°C, which can be caused by illness or insufficient warmth. Heatstroke is the most common symptom, which may occur when the body temperature is higher than 38\u202f°C or when the temperature changes dramatically. Still, heatstroke occurs mostly when the heat storage rate of the human body is very high. In this case, if a person goes to an area of lower temperature, the skin stomata will be closed suddenly, which makes the thermal energy inside the body unable to be released and causes thermal imbalance. If the body temperature exceeds 42\u202f°C, the risk of death may even occur. Heat exhaustion may occur when a person spends a long time in a high-temperature environment, resulting in excessive perspiration, dehydration, and salt loss. Heat spasm, which is somewhat similar to the symptoms of heatstroke, actually presents something drastically different; heat spasm is caused mainly by intense physical exercise in a high-temperature environment, resulting in the rapid loss of water and salt inside the human body, a rapid decline in blood sodium ion concentration, and the failure of muscle to bear the consequent load [21]. The activities of bacteria vary under different degrees of humidity; when the humidity exceeds 70%, such environment facilitates the breeding of mold and dust mites. If people work in such environment for a long time, various diseases, such as allergic rhinitis, asthma, and eczema, are likely to occur, and severe cases may involve ceaseless cough and diarrhea. When the humidity is below 40%, dust and bacteria are more likely to adhere to the nasal surface and stimulate mucosa and irritate the throat, resulting in body discomfort, skin allergies (itch and crack, etc.), and even severe cases that involve a swollen body and pain; when the humidity is too low or too high, the number of patients with respiratory diseases and skin diseases will rise, and these diseases, coupled with allergies and aging, may cause other symptoms [22]. According to the abovementioned, when a person fails to take in adequate nutrition and water in an uncomfortable indoor environment with poor ventilation, the human body is very likely to be harmed. Therefore, people should maintain indoor environments that are well ventilated, supplement body moisture, take in appropriate nutrition, and engage in more physical exercise, which will help to improve immunity and allow us to have better energy and vitality for new challenges. 2.3 Wind force and CO2 When the sun shines on the earth, the uneven heating of the poles and equator causes a difference in air pressure, and wind is generated when the air moves from high pressure to low pressure. Wind is like a double-edge sword; it can both calm the mind and be a destructive force; however, it can also be an inexhaustible source of energy that illuminates the future. Wind exists everywhere with constant and unpredictable changes, and our increasing understanding of wind allows people to predict and use it. The most current ideal application of wind is wind power generation. The method for assessing wind can be dated back to Francis Beaufort, an admiral of the British Royal Navy, who had longed for the sea since his childhood. He attached such importance to nautical charting technology that he spent his whole life on it, which bore fruitful results [23]. In 1805, he categorized wind based on the impact of wind on the sea surface, known as the Beaufort wind force scale, which divides wind into 12 levels; in 1830, the Beaufort wind force scale became the record standard of the British Royal Navy; in 1923, it was slightly revised and became the standardized index of wind speed calculation in meteorology; after 1950, due to climate change and different geographical locations, the World Meteorological Organization revised the number of levels as 13 to 17. However, these are not regular levels, meaning they are just recommended grades [24,25]. Carbon dioxide is a kind of greenhouse gas. In recent years, global warming issues have attracted much attention, such as the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 and the Paris Agreement in 2015, which aim to reduce carbon emissions and lower the average temperature rise of the earth through concerted global efforts. In 2012, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the Arctic exceeded 400\u202fppm for the first time, which made researchers extremely concerned, and meteorological experts said that it is an abnormal climate. In 2015, the carbon emissions of more than 40 global monitoring stations exceeded 400\u202fppm, which broke the historical measurement record. This phenomenon was estimated to appear after 3 million to 5 million years, meaning that the reliability of these data on climate prediction has been reduced [26\u201328]. It is also the beginning of abnormal climate, such as the uneven distribution of the four seasons, and the phenomena of Saint-baby and anti-Saint-baby, the impacts of which have already been deeply perceived, and some scholars even predict that there will be a short glacial period on earth after 2022 [29]. The atmosphere is 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and the remaining 1% is rare gases, of which CO2 accounts for roughly 0.04%. The proportion of CO2 is so small that it is difficult to imagine the tremendous impact on the earth caused by the change of CO2 concentration. The high concentration of CO2 will also harm the human body. When the concentration of CO2 is low, there is virtually no odor; however, when the concentration is high, an acid odor will be generated. CO2 is more likely to accumulate in low and closed spaces, such as basements, garages, and sewers, thus, people should ensure good ventilation when entering such spaces. If the human body absorbs excessive CO2, they may suffer from mental distress, dizziness, and vomiting, which lowers work efficiency, worsens learning ability, and even affects the quality of sleep. The more people sleep, the more tired they will feel [30,31]. ASHRAE recommends that indoor CO2 concentration should not exceed 1000\u202fppm. The human perception of CO2 concentration is shown in Fig. 2 . 3 Particulate matter (PM) and thermal comfort index Industrial development and climate change in recent years have deteriorated air quality, and the term \u201csmog\u201d has been coined. The causes for smog are complex, and involve various pollutants. It floats in the air like particulate matter, also known as \u201cPM\u201d, and its size is categorized by the unit of micron, as shown in Table 1 . Fig. 3 shows impact of particulate matter on the human body. PM enters the body through human respiration, and the effect on the human body varies due to different sizes, as shown in Fig. 3 [32]. Some scholars have conducted biological studies on PM, and their experiments show that long-term exposure to poor air quality can increase the likelihood of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Severe cases may even include lung cancer, myocarditis, myocardial infarction, diabetes, atherosclerosis, glomerular filament inflammation, and tubular injury. The worst case involves the risk of death. These experiments concluded that, as the PM diameter increases for every 10 μ m / m 3 , the mortality rate of lung cancer rises by 8%, the incidence of diabetes rises by 8%, the mortality rate of cardiopulmonary diseases rises by 6%, and the total mortality rate rises by 4%. The calculation formula is shown as Eq. (1). The 8 sums of valid data are needed for the first 12\u202fh. The 3 sums of valid data are needed for the first 4\u202fh. (1) PM 2.5 = 0.5 × Average of the first 12 hours + 0.5 × Average of the first 4 hours Abnormal climate has been intensified in recent years. According to the report by IPCC, as jointly established by UNEP and WMO, countries around the world are suffering from different climate anomalies, such as sudden rain, drought, extreme heat, and freezing. Fanger (1972), at the International Center of the Danish University, analyzed the influencing factors for thermal comfort through an experiment on over 1300 subjects. With this experiment, he designed the human body thermal balance equation, and made the final overall analysis with Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) and PPD. In 1984, this method was included in the international standards, and denominated as ISO 7730. After revisions in 1994 and 2005, the method is now denominated as ISO 7730: 2005 [15]. 4 Moving Average (MA) Moving Average (MA) is a digital filter that can be used to analyze time series data and calculate MA through the variation of such data. MA can improve the recent wave pattern variation and reflect the long-term wave pattern trend to improve data accuracy. The three methods for MA calculation are shown, as follows: (1) Standard Moving Average: This is the most basic method for MA calculation. It averages the changes of wave patterns in t samples by adding them together, as shown in Eq. (2). (2) MA ( t ) = P t + P t - 1 + ⋯ + P 2 + P 1 t In wave pattern analysis, the time requirements vary from one sensing component to another, such as fast-changing ultrasonic and infrared. In this case, time t can be shorter; while time t can be longer for the variables of slower changes, such as temperature and dissolved oxygen. The number of samples can be adjusted appropriately according to different sensing components. (2) Weighted Moving Average (WMA): This method multiplies the wave pattern variation in t samples with a linear decreasing weight, as shown in Eq. (3) and Fig. 4 . (3) WMA ( t ) = t P t + t - 1 P t - 1 + ⋯ + 2 P 2 + P 1 t + t - 1 + ⋯ + 2 + 1 This method shows that, the more recent the data, the more influential they are; the older the data, the less influential they will be till zero influence is reached, and the data change is predicted accordingly. (3) Exponential Moving Average (EMA): This method multiplies the wave pattern variation in t samples with an exponential decreasing weight, as shown in Fig. 4 and Eq. (4). (4) EMA ( t ) = P t + 1 - α P t - 1 + 1 - α 2 P t - 2 + ⋯ 1 + 1 - α + 1 - α 2 + ⋯ This method is infinite in theory. The more recent the sensing data, the larger their impact; the older the sensing data, the less their impact, and such impact is too small to be systematically analyzed. The data change is predicted accordingly. Different MA methods are compared in Table 2 5 Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) and predicted Percentage of Dissatisfied (PPD) The thermal comfort predicted mean vote is mainly used to predict the human perception of the environmental changes in a controlled space. Professor Fanger analyzed the human body thermal balance equation, and deduced six main parameters through the thermal exchange between the human body and the environment. The first four are environmental factors, and the other two are personal factors. 1. Air Temperature 2. Mean Radiant Temperature 3. Relative Humidity 4. Air Velocity 5. Clothing Insulation 6. Metabolic This study is to explain the thermal exchange between the human body and the environment (a.k.a. human body thermal balance equation), as shown from Eq. (5) to Eq. (24): (5) S = M - W - E c - E res - C res - H (6) E C = E d + E s (7) H = R + C Eq. (5)\u2013(7) can be integrated into Eq. (8) corresponding to Table 3 and Fig. 5 : (8) S = M - W - ( E d + E s ) - E res - C res - ( R + C ) After the human body thermal balance equation is obtained, the six main parameters can be inserted to deduce the PMV equation: (9) PMV = B mod × S (10) B mod = 0.303 × e - 0.036 M + 0.028 1.

When the iteration is completed, the PMV index is divided into seven grades to evaluate comfort, as shown in Table 4 . All PMV-related formulas are integrated, as follows: (25) PMV = 0.303 × e - 0.036 M + 0.028 × { ( M - W ) - 3.05 × 10 - 3 5733 - 6.99 × M - W - p a - 0.42 [ M - W - 58.15 ] - 1.7 × 10 - 5 × M ( 5867 - p a ) - 0.0014 × M × 34 - t a - f cl × h c × ( t cl - t a ) - 3.96 × 10 - 8 × f cl [ ( t cl + 273 ) 4 - ( t r + 273 ) 4 ] } (26) t cl = 35.7 - 0.028 M - W - I cl ( 3.96 × 10 - 8 × f cl [ t cl + 273 4 - t r + 273 4 ] + f cl × h c × ( t cl - t a ) ) PPD is mainly used to assess individual sensitivity to heat and cold, as shown in Eq. (27), and the relationship between PMV and PPD is shown in Fig. 6 . (27) P P D = 100 - 95 e - ( 0.03353 × PMV 4 + 0.2179 × PMV 2 ) When the PMV index is zero (the ideal state) in the controlled space, the PPD index is predicted to be 5%, which indicates that 5 persons out of 100 persons in the ideal space are unsatisfied, and the different thermal comfort perception of each individual is evaluated. 6 Clothing insulation In terms of clothing insulation, this study supposes data by formulating tables, and adds the data of human clothing to obtain the final result; Table 5 can serve as reference. Regarding metabolic, this study supposes data by formulating tables, and analysis is based on the work of indoor environment personnel. Table 6 can serve as reference for the comparison of different ethnic groups in different areas. The thermal comfort standard of an indoor environment can be set by referring to Table 7 . This part is the main reference standard for this study. In addition, there are many other methods and standards for different situations, as shown in Table 8 . 7 System architecture This study devises a thermal comfort control system, as based on the IoT Smart House System, assesses and analyzes the node for indoor environmental measurement and the fuzzy control rules according to the experimental data, and conducts a questionnaire survey to summarize the paper. The focus of this study is to efficiently control the load devices in indoor environments, in order that people can perceive good thermal comfort in the indoor environment, which enables them to enjoy their leisure time. A comfortable environment for rest improves the quality of life and enhances human vitality, thus, everyone can be physically and mentally prepared for new challenges. This study analyzes indoor environmental data through the scatter layout method, and determines the node for measurement through the minimum variation and minimum mean deviation. When the data deviation of a node for measurement is excessively huge, it is difficult to stabilize system control; in contrast, when the data deviation is mild, the effect of control is good and the system is more stable. When the difference between the data of the node for measurement and the data of overall environment is huge, the data of this node fails to accurately reflect the overall indoor environment; in contrast, when the difference is mild, the reliability of this node in the overall indoor environment is much higher. The minimum variation and the minimum mean deviation, respectively, represent the stability and reliability of the node for measurement. Fig. 7 indicates the system modules completed by this study. At this stage, this study involves: (1) RTL CODE compilation of various positioning calculations and network security programming design; (2) Establishment of sensing nodes to form Multi-sensor Fusion Computing, and the development and integration of the network design on Arduino UNO advanced development platform; (3) Integration of the security positioning systems of both wireless sensor networks and multi-sensor fusion operations; (4) Applying the IoT developed in this study to the modularization of the security positioning system, and using the study results to build databases for network sharing. The research plan is based on the architecture of the IoT Smart House System. The thermal comfort control system is built and tested in this laboratory, and the team will apply for a patent to publish related research papers. The overall system architecture can be divided into four parts: The first part is environment sensing; the second is wireless transmission; the third is analysis and storage, and the fourth is load control. For the first part, three groups of environmental sensing equipment are equipped in an indoor environment. The locations of the sensor nodes are shown in Fig. 8 , and the views of the sensors from different perspectives are shown in Figs. 9 and 10 . Each group of sensing devices is equipped with Arduino Mega 2560, sensors for temperature and humidity, wind speed, CO2 and particulate matter, as well as ZigBee and a buzzer. In another three groups of sensing nodes, node one is the main control node, an additional infrared remote controller is installed to control the air conditioner, and an electric relay is installed to control the fan and humidifier. When the sensor measures the indoor environmental signal, the received signal will be further processed through Arduino Mega 2560. The second part is mainly to exchange the signals processed by Arduino Mega 2560, which are analyzed on the computer end through ZigBee transmission. The third part is mainly to realize the indicators and standards mentioned in Part II, which are analyzed, processed, and displayed by Visual Studio C # software, and the analyzed data are stored in the Microsoft Excel database to provide future data query and basis. The fourth part is mainly based on the analyzed data, and load devices are properly controlled for an indoor environment with thermal comfort; to this end, load devices including buzzer, electric fan, humidifier, and air conditioner are used. When the concentration of CO2 or PM is too high or exceeds the standard, each node will remind the indoor environment personnel through the buzzer. Indoor personnel can use the node location as a reference basis to decide whether to open or close the vent sash, windows, and doors, and to take measures for indoor ventilation or sealing. Meanwhile, Arduino Mega 2560 will increase or decrease the temperature by controlling the air conditioner, fan, and humidifier according to the signal received by ZigBee. The complete system architecture is shown in Fig. 11 . The software architecture can be divided into two parts: the first part is the node end, and the second part is the computer end. The system flowchart of node 1 is shown in Fig. 12 (a), and the system flowchart of nodes 2 and 3 is shown in Fig. 12(b). The computer-end system flowchart is shown in Fig. 12(c). In the first part, three groups of environmental sensing equipment are equipped in an indoor environment, each of which will capture a signal within a certain interval. All signals are integrated by Arduino Mega 2560, processed by the MA method to minimize the effect of noise for better accuracy, and then, the processed data is transmitted and communicates with the ZigBee coordinator through each node of ZigBee. During the transmission, the cyclic redundancy check method is used to confirm normal signal transmission without missing packets. The first node is the main control node. When the signal analyzed by the computer end is received, the control node will identify whether to start the buzzer, electric fan, humidifier, and air conditioner, and whether to turn up or turn down the air conditioner. The only load device that can be controlled by the second and third nodes is the buzzer, which mainly serves for showing the environment and further reminding or informing the indoor environment personnel of environment problems. In part 2, the data received by each node of the indoor environment are integrated for analysis, and the analysis results are stored in the database to determine whether PMV, PM2.5, and CO2 are abnormal or not. If the indoor environment signal is abnormal, the analysis results are sent back to each node through the ZigBee coordinator for corresponding action. 8 Experimental analysis and system realization According to the experimental results, the reliability and feasibility of the system are validated, and the entire system architecture of the study is presented in charts and tables. The scatter layout experiment is mainly to determine where sensor nodes are installed. First, the spatial characteristics of the laboratory are evaluated, including the positions of doors, windows, air vents, and indoor equipment, and the optimal locations of sensors are selected according to experimental evaluation. There are eight hypothetical positions for the experimental nodes, as shown in Fig. 13 . Following the evaluation, the temperature, humidity, wind speed, CO2 and PM are individually evaluated. The sensor height for this experiment is approximately 1.2 to 1.5\u202fm. The temperature data of the scatter layout experiment are shown in Fig. 14 and analysis data are shown in Table 9 . In terms of selecting the best position according to temperature, the main evaluation parameters in this study are the maximum variation and the average temperature difference between each node and the whole space; the position with the largest maximum variation features poor control effect and an unstable system, while the position with the smallest maximum variation features better control effect and a stable system. Take node 4 as an example; this node is a cold air outlet where the temperature variation is excessively large and fluctuating; the average temperature difference is obtained by subtracting the temperature of each node from the average temperature of the eight sensor nodes. The smaller the average temperature difference, the higher the reliability of the temperature data in this space; the higher the average temperature difference, the more this space is affected by environmental or human factors; for example, node 1 is too close to the door, thus, when people are moving around the space or installing and welding the experiment equipment, the environmental errors may be potentially enlarged. The humidity data of the scatter layout experiment are shown in Fig. 15 , and the analysis data are shown in Table 10 . Considering temperature, analysis of the position with the best humidity is based on the difference between the minimum variation and the minimum average humidity. The analysis data of wind speed are shown in Table 11 and the data of the scatter layout are shown in Fig. 16 . The position with the best wind speed is the difference between the maximum variation and the average wind speed. Since the difference of node 4 at the air vent is too large, it will affect the overall evaluation, thus, the data of this node are excluded. The analysis data of CO2 are shown in Table 12 , and the data of the scatter layout are shown in Fig. 17 . The position with the best CO2 level is the difference between the maximum variation and the average CO2 level, and this signal is easily understood by looking at the graph. Usually the number of persons in the lab in the morning is fewer than 5, which is obviously shown in the graph; while in the afternoon, graduate students and specialized students come to the lab, and the total number of people is approximately 10 to 15. When the number of people is too large, it is difficult to achieve a balance between CO2 concentration and thermal comfort, as it is necessary to maintain convection between indoor air and outdoor air, thus, cold feelings will occur in some areas. At present, the university is constructing a new building, which is located directly opposite our laboratory, and when the windows are open, the PM concentration near the windows sometimes reaches 40 u g / m 3 . This part mainly focuses on lowering the PM concentration in the indoor environment; therefore, the windows are semi-permanent closed, in order that the indoor PM data will be zero, making it impossible to formulate an evaluation chart. The only way to ventilate the environment is to open the windows near the passage. This study adopts the scatter layout experiment to comprehensively evaluate the regional scatter and uniformity of an area 1.2\u202fm to 1.5\u202fm above the ground. Following the evaluation, node 2, node 3, and node 8 are selected as the main control nodes, and node 1, node 2, and node 3 are re-labeled, respectively, as shown in Fig. 8. 9 Controlled comparison Through the introduction of Fuzzy control in the previous part, this part shows the effectiveness and results of Fuzzy control. This study compares three different cases, uncontrolled, constant control, and Fuzzy control. Given that the indoor environment signal will not change too fast, the system of this study is designed to extract one sum of indoor environment data every 10\u202fs, and MA is also extracted in every 10 sums of data. In order to make the system stable and prevent excessively large variation, the data in the first thirty minutes are excluded. The first method is an uncontrolled method that turns off the air conditioner and fan, and opens the vent sash, windows, and doors, after which the comfort perception of the indoor environment is tested without the control equipment. The second control method is a constant method that sets the temperature of the air conditioner at 26\u202f°C, opens two fans and humidifiers, and closes the vent sash, windows, and doors, after which the comfort perception of the indoor environment is tested with the constant indoor equipment. The third control method is \u201cFuzzy Control\u201d. This method integrates the sensing signals received by three nodes through C#, uses Fuzzy control to analyze the indoor environmental data, makes relative load control, and uses PMV to analyze the f comfort perception in this situation. Tables 13\u201316 show the analysis data of the three control methods, respectively, and compares them. Fig. 18 shows the comparison results of the three control methods. 10 Realization and application of C# man-machine interface This study uses Visual Studio C# software to design a human-machine monitoring interface. The human-machine monitoring interface receives and displays the data of three nodes to the interface, stores the received data in the Microsoft Excel database for follow-up experiments and analysis, and takes the corresponding indicators and standards as the evaluation basis. The interface designed by this study is divided into four pages; the indoor environment monitoring interface, CO2 and PM interface, thermal comfort data interface, and thermal comfort parameter setting interface. The indoor environment monitoring interface is the first page of the C# interface, and is also the starting page. In the layout design, the left side shows the monitoring data and load status of each node; the upper right side shows the overall spatial evaluation; and the lower right side shows the indoor environment. The comfort level is presented by different images, as shown in Fig. 19 , and the indoor environment monitoring interface is shown in Fig. 20 . 11 Conclusions and future works This study devises a thermal comfort control system based on an IoT Smart House System, assesses and analyzes the node for indoor environmental measurement and the Fuzzy control rules according to the experimental data, and conducts a questionnaire survey to summarize the paper. The focus of this study is to efficiently control load devices in indoor environments, in order that people can perceive good thermal comfort in indoor environments, thus, enabling them to enjoy their leisure time. A comfortable environment for rest improves the quality of life and enhances human vitality, and everyone can be physically and mentally prepared for new challenges. This study analyzes the indoor environmental data through the scatter layout method and determines the node for measurement through minimum variation and minimum mean deviation. When the data deviation of a node for measurement is excessively huge, it is difficult to stabilize system control; in contrast, when the data deviation is mild, the effect of control is good and the system is more stable. When the difference between the data of the node for measurement and the data of overall environment is huge, the data of this node fails to reflect the overall indoor environment; in contrast, when the difference is mild, the reliability of this node in the overall indoor environment is much higher. The minimum variation and minimum mean deviation, respectively, represent the stability and reliability of the node for measurement. In this study, air temperature, relative humidity, air velocity, and mean radiant temperature are the actual sensing data. The clothing insulation default value is 0.6 clo, and the metabolic default value is 1.2 met. After integrating and comparing the experimental data, the most comfortable environmental data in this space are evaluated as: air temperature 26\u202f°C, relative humidity 60%, air velocity 0.65\u202fm/s. At this time, PMV is 0.023 and PPD is 5%. When the actual measurement lasts for one day, the environmental data are, as follows: air temperature 26.2\u202f°C, relative humidity 68.5%, air velocity 0.64\u202fm/s, PMV 0.164, and PPD 5.6%. The results of the questionnaire survey on the thermal comfort of the whole system show that 5 subjects were very satisfied, 5 were satisfied, and 2 had no opinion. This suggests that the system is, to some extent, reliable for thermal comfort control and actual human perception. While the core of this study is thermal comfort, the nodes are also equipped with CO2 and PM sensors. When the concentration of CO2 and PM is too high, it is necessary to ventilate or close the windows; however, this study still fails to balance thermal comfort and the concentration of CO2 and PM. Therefore, although CO2 and PM in this study can serve as reference, the value of such data can be improved if the balance between thermal comfort and the concentration of CO2 and PM is achieved. The focus of this lab is the application of IoT, while the author focuses on the application of a Smart House. When referring to the thermal comfort index in searching for information on indoor environmental quality indicators, the author analyzed volatile indoor gases, such as CO, CO2, formaldehyde, and sulfur dioxide, and evaluated the impact of an indoor environment on the human body. If these two indicators can be combined for the best control, it will be valuable to the application of a Smart House.

This system adopts the scatter layout method to determine the best indoor node for measurement, assesses stability through minimum variation, and reliability through the minimum mean deviation, and uses a questionnaire to discuss whether the experimental data are different from human feelings. In this study, the thermal comfort index is calculated according to the ISO 7730 standard, and two methods, including the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) and Predicted Percentage of Dissatisfied (PPD), are adopted to assess the human perception of thermal comfort in the whole space. There are six kinds of data for assessment, which fall into the categories of environmental factors and personal factors. The data of the environmental factor are air temperature, mean radiant temperature, relative humidity, and air velocity, and the data of the personal factor are clothing insulation, and metabolic.",
