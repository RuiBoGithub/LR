Radiant air conditioning (RAC) systems are widely used because of the advantage of higher thermal comfort compared to convection systems. However, RAC systems exhibit considerable hysteresis and significant time delays in heat transmission from the terminal to the interior environment. Traditional feedback control methods do not adequately account for the system's delay impact while implementing dynamic control, resulting in a mismatch between supply and demand loads in time series, an inefficient impact of interior temperature control, and energy waste. According to this study, the time-delay characteristics of the RAC system are quantified by the startup-process delay time (SPDT) and operating-phase integrated delay time (IDT). The system startup time is set by the SPDT. Based on the IDT, the prediction interval of the model predictive control (MPC) and the step time of rolling optimization are determined. On this basis, a short-term forecasting model of air conditioning operating load and the regulation model of the system using MPC are established and verified by comparing with the conventional rule-based control of constant water temperature (CRBC) and proportionally-integral-differential (PID) control. The results for the RAC system with a large time delay indicate that the stability of indoor temperature under MPC controlling is 18.8% higher than the PID control and 63.5% higher than the CRBC method. Also, the indoor temperature controlled by the MPC is closest to the set value and shows the minimum fluctuation. Furthermore, the overall energy consumption of the system is estimated for reducing by 14.89% in comparison with the CRBC and by 8.51% in comparison with the PID.

Generally, air conditioning terminal configurations fall into two categories: convection and radial. The radiant air conditioning (RAC) system, in which the radiant terminal works as the radiant surface to cool or heat each surface by long-wave radiant with the inner surface of the envelope or others, combines both radiant and convective forms of heat transfer. Compared with the convection air conditioning methods, not only the radiative heat transfer is considered in the RAC system, but also smaller vertical temperature differences [5], higher thermal comfort [6,7], lower energy consumption [8\u201310], and higher energy efficiency [11] are provided. Further, the RAC system has a low demand for energy. It enables more extensive use of renewable energy, improving the system's energy-saving rate and economic effects [12,13], and thus has a good development prospect. Despite this, the RAC system is one typical kind of nonlinear heat transfer system [14\u201316]. The heat transfer process is characterized by large thermal inertia [17,18] and a long delay between the terminal and indoor air heat transfer. As a consequence, always, the energy supply of the system misses the actual load demand of the building in time series, resulting in energy waste. For the characteristics of the RAC system mentioned above, the control of the system is more complicated and challenging than the convection air conditioning system. There are two optimal ways that the RAC system is controlled, one is controlling startup and shutdown times, and another is controlling operation. In the system startup process, two processes are required to pass through, the heat transfer between the medium flow in the system and the inside of the radiant plate, and the heat transfer between the radiation terminal and the indoor air. The total delay time is called startup-process delay time (SPDT) in this study. Due to the large time delay of the RAC system, the room temperature cannot reach the set-point quickly at the initial stage of air conditioning. In the author's previous study [19], the radiation heat transfer characteristics and time delay of exposed capillary ceiling radiant panels system during startup under unstable conditions were studied through CFD simulation and experimental testing. Xuhan [20] et al. studied the variation rule of parameters in a concrete ceiling radiant cooling system during the starting process in summer, and the results showed that it could not reach a stable state until 7\u20139h after starting. Liu [21] tested that the delay time of the heating period of the different floor structures was about 3\u20137h. However, there are few studies on applying the SPDT in RAC system regulation. Consequently, the SPDT can be applied in the RAC system with a long delay to determine the time to turn on the system in advance, thereby meeting the energy supply and demand as well as reducing energy consumption. Currently, traditional control methods, such as ON/OFF control and proportionally-integral-differential (PID) control, are widely used in engineering to control a system operation [22]. Nevertheless, these two control methods are not satisfactory for controlling processes with a time delay [23,24], resulting in poor indoor thermal comfort and high energy consumption in the RAC systems. Therefore, it is imperative to construct a novel control model to address the issue of long-time delays in RAC systems, enhance control precision, and ensure low energy consumption. Over the past few years, there has been an increase in the popularity of model predictive control (MPC) in the area of HVAC system control [25,26] since it is capable of solving nonlinear [27,28], multivariate [27], and time-delayed [29,30] optimum control problems. MPC generally consists of a predictive model, rolling optimization, and a feedback correction mechanism [31]. And research conducted by the MPC method has shown that it has the characteristics of energy savings, reduction in consumption, and improved thermal comfort. For the RAC systems, Chen [32] et al. found that applying MPC in radiant ceiling cooling systems can make regional air temperature more stable. Charles [33] et al. used a cryogenic RAC system as an example to minimize daily energy costs by determining hourly cooling set points through the MPC. Ruixin [34] et al. co-simulated a hybrid air conditioning system with radiant floor heating and an all-air air system using TRNSYS and MATLAB. According to simulation results, the suggested adaptive MPC approach saves 22% of energy compared to PID control. From the literature in Table 1 , we find little research on MPC models combined with the time-delay characteristics of the RAC systems. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct more in-depth studies. During the system operation phase, the time delay of the RAC system is mainly reflected in the change of room temperature lagging behind the adjustment of system equipment parameters, which is called the operating-phase integrated delay time (IDT) in this study. Due to the existence of the IDT, the time parameters in the MPC regulation model of the RAC system are more significant. On the one hand, the precision of prediction models is becoming increasingly demanding, and the prediction interval is getting shorter with the development of various intelligent technologies. Lan [41] et al. pointed out that the lead time of the dynamic load prediction model is within 1 h, which usually corresponds to the time interval (15, 30 or 60 min) in control optimization. Meanwhile, Lan [41] et al. considered the historical values of the input parameters at time t, t-i, t-2i, t-3i, etc. in establishing the prediction model and found that the prediction model with multiple historical time intervals presents higher prediction accuracy. By hierarchically combining Support Vector Data Descriptions, Jaehaket [42] et al. achieved real-time load prediction. On the other hand, the time step of MPC rolling optimization also tends to shorten. Ye [43] et al. pointed out that the time step in the optimization process should be reasonably shortened to enable MPC to adapt to changes. Yujiao [44] et al. realized MPC control of the air-conditioning system by using the data-driven method of the Scikit-learn library in Python and setting the time step of the control algorithm to 10 min. Trent [45] et al. proposed a hybrid multi-layer MPC approach to maintain occupant comfort by employing zone operating temperature indicators and customer feedback. The fixed time step for predictive control is 15 min. Gianni [46] et al. discussed the operating cost optimization of intelligent buildings based on the MPC strategy and set the time step as 15 min. It is evident that the choice of prediction interval and rolling optimization time step tends to be shorter, and most of them are empirical values without a theoretical underpinning. Therefore, it is essential to investigate the time lag of heat transfer on RAC systems and to implement advanced and precise optimizing control methods. Owing to the time delay of the RAC system, the prediction model and optimization time step cannot be shortened to pursue the control accuracy blindly. According to the time delay characteristics, the operation time and time parameters can be demonstrated, achieving an accurate indoor parameter and reducing cost. Accordingly, the effect of unstable factors on the load will be mitigated, which is vital for satisfying the system energy supply and building load demand, ensuring the stability of interior temperature, and cutting the energy consumption of air conditioning systems. The main contribution of this research lies in establishing the MPC regulation model of the RAC systems based on system delay time, which effectively solves the load mismatch and energy waste problems caused by the large delay time. Besides, the following innovations represent the study's major achievements. 1. The action time of the MPC method is determined according to the system delay time. A method for deciding the pre-startup time of the system based on the SPDT and the MPC rolling optimization time step based on the IDT is proposed. The SPDT and IDT quantify the delay characteristics of the RAC system during the startup process and operation process, respectively, and determine the action time of the MPC strategy, which constitutes the MPC regulation model. 2. The load forecasting model is established based on the IDT. The IDT, which is proposed for the delay effect of the RAC systems, is utilized to determine the prediction interval of the model to improve prediction accuracy. The delay time parameters of the system are taken into account in the load prediction model, the selection time of the historical data is optimized, and the historical interval with the least error is chosen to figure out the input parameters and set up the model. 3. The MPC regulation strategy for the RAC system is established. The MPC model of the capillary radiation air conditioning (CRAC) system is proposed to fill some gaps in the study of the RAC systems. Based on the time-delay characteristics of the RAC systems, the control model is established by optimizing the control process from the two aspects of the system startup process and operation phase, respectively. The following is the structure of this research. The methods employed are described in Section 2. The case study is introduced in Section 3. Section 4 compares the control performance of MPC with the other two control models using the co-simulation platform. The inadequacies of this study are examined in Section 5. Section 6 summarizes the findings of the research. 2 Methodology The methodology of this study consists of two steps (see Fig. 1 ), experimental testing, as well as modeling and simulation. The delay time parameters were obtained through experimental testing and acted on the model development and MPC strategy formulation. The models are the load forecasting model built by artificial neural network (ANN) and the indoor temperature prediction model linearly transformed from the load forecasting model. The MPC strategy is aimed at room temperature regulation, combined with immediate feedback on indoor temperature and dynamic optimization of operating parameters to reduce energy consumption. The simulation platform built by TRNSYS and the genetic algorithm (GA) are working together to implement the MPC strategy. 2.1 Delay time testing Due to the complexity of buildings and systems, there are many factors affecting the delay time, such as the building envelope, system characteristics parameters, outdoor meteorological parameters, etc. Therefore, the theoretical analysis may not be comprehensive or accurate enough. Experimental measurements are carried out to explore the delay time. 2.1.1 Testing on site of the SPDT In accordance with Fig. 2 , the sum of the time (t 0 to t 1 ) required from the system startup to the stabilization of the radiant surface temperature and the time (t 1 to t 2 ) required from the stabilization of the radiant surface temperature to the first stabilization of the indoor temperature is defined as the SPDT. The time from the startup of the equipment to the first stable state of the room temperature is measured experimentally, namely the SPDT. It's believed that the temperature stabilization occurs when the temperature differences between the two-time steps is less than a 0.2 °C. 2.1.2 Testing on site of the IDT Referring to the acquisition method of building thermal response time proposed by Yabin [47] et al., the IDT (t cr ) is defined as the time period during which the indoor temperature change lags behind the modification of system equipment parameters in the system control process, which couples the envelope and system delay effects. Predicting the current load in advance according to the IDT can better optimize the system operation strategy [48] and solve the regulation problems caused by the large time delay of the CRAC system. And the gap between supply and demand for energy can be narrowed at the supplying side. The valley-peak method is used to find the value of t cr by choosing three parameters, i.e., chiller power consumption, pump power consumption, and indoor temperature [47]. The testing method and applications of the ITRT are illustrated in Fig. 3 . 2.2 Load forecasting model The load variation process of the air-conditioning system is a typical nonlinear process with dynamic randomness, time variability, multi-disturbance and uncertainty [24]. Accurate load prediction is helpful for \u2018on-demand adjustment\u2019, can effectively reduce energy consumption [49], and is conducive to system optimization control. Presently, load forecasting methods can be categorized as white box models, black box models, or gray box models, which combines the formers. With the development of intelligent algorithms, black box models are widely used, such as support vector machines, ANN and so on. Among them, ANN has strong adaptability, self-organization and self-learning ability [50,51], and has obvious advantages in dealing with load data with nonlinear characteristics [52\u201355]. It has been proved that ANN has good prediction performance in the cooling and heating load prediction of institutional buildings [56\u201358], district buildings [49,55] and other scenarios. Therefore, the ANN is employed in constructing a short-term forecasting model of air conditioning load based on the IDT. The specific process of model establishment is shown in Fig. 4 . The structure of the ANN model includes an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer [59]. The input layer is the input parameter determined by the sensitivity analysis method. The trial-and-error test determines the number of neurons in the hidden layer. And the output layer is the predicted load. The input-output relationship of the ANN model is shown in Equation (1). (1) y = p [ f ( W 1 x + B 1 ) W 2 + B 2 ] Where, f and p are the same tansig activation functions; W 1 and B 1 are respectively the weight and deviation vector of the first hidden layer; W 2 and B 2 are respectively the weight and deviation vectors of the second hidden layer; x and y are input and output vectors, respectively. To validate the accuracy of the ANN model prediction results for air conditioning load, the average relative error NMBE and coefficient of variation mean square error Cv (RMSE) values recommended in the ASHRAE 14\u20132014 standard [60] were utilized to assess prediction performance of the load prediction model. Both are defined as Equations (2) and (3), respectively. (2) N M B E = ∑ i = 1 N ( Q s i − Q m i ) N × Q m × 100 % (3) C v ( R M S E ) = [ ∑ ( Q s i − Q m i ) 2 / N ] 1 2 Q m × 100 % where, Q si is the load prediction result, kWh; Q mi is the actual load value, kWh; Q m is the average value of the actual load data, kWh. N is the number of datasets. Compared with other air-conditioning systems, the RAC system has a prolonged delay, which leads to a mismatch between supply and demand loads. Therefore, it is of high research value and significance to consider the time delay in the selection of input parameters and prediction interval of the load forecasting model. 2.2.1 Input parameters There are many factors affecting load, but it is not the case that the more input parameters of the ANN model, the better. Excess parameters will complicate the network structure of the model and lead to prolonged training time. Therefore, input parameters should be selected reasonably before establishing the ANN model. Sensitivity analysis of the input parameters is performed using the standardized regression coefficient (SRC) approach, as shown in Equation (4). Then the SRC of the jTH input parameter, which is dimensionless, can be defined according to Equation (5). (4) y ∧ − y \u203e σ y = ∑ j = 1 N β j σ j ( x j − x j \u203e ) / σ y σ j (5) S R C j = β j σ j / σ y Where, β j is generally referred to as the regression coefficient and is used to minimize the sum of squares of error. x \u203e j and σ j are the average value and variance of the jTH input parameter, respectively. y \u203e and σ y are the average value and variance of the output value, respectively. If the final obtained SRC is positive, it means that the input parameters are positively correlated with the output parameters, otherwise, the negative. The importance of different input parameters can be sorted according to the absolute value of SRC, and influencing factors whose absolute value of SRC is below 0.2 can be excluded [61]. 2.2.2 Interval combination In consideration of the delay effect of the system and the thermal inertia of the envelope, the model parameters at the historical time, current time, and predicted time were considered as the input parameters, and the model output was the predicted load, as shown in Fig. 5 . The time difference between the current time and the historical time is defined as the historical interval, which is represented by i. The time difference between the current time and the predicted time is defined as the predicted interval and is denoted by i'. Additionally, to prevent the impact of load mutation on the model prediction accuracy, the average value of the load is used as the model parameter. It should be noted that the historical interval i and the predicted interval i' in this paper are not necessarily equal. In the case of determining predicted interval i', the combination of historical interval i and predicted interval i' corresponding to the model with the smallest error is found as the final prediction model. This strategy vastly increases the prediction accuracy of the model. The expressions of input parameter x at different times is shown in Table 2 . The value of historical interval i is determined according to the accuracy of the load prediction model under different combined working conditions with predicted interval i'. 2.3 MPC strategy The MPC model based on delay time is divided into two phases to regulate and control, namely the startup process and the operation phase. The correlation diagram is shown in Fig. 6 . The SPDT determines how long the system is switched on in advance. And the IDT determines the prediction interval of the model and the time step of rolling optimization. The details of the MPC strategy implementation are as follows. An MPC design mainly includes a prediction model and an optimization algorithm [43]. In the MPC prediction model, a room temperature prediction model is adopted in this paper, which can understand the control effect of indoor temperature more intuitively. Since the change process of system load is directly relevant to the operation parameters on time series, the average load and the current indoor room temperature are taken as the key factors to carry out linear regression. The prediction model of room temperature after linear regression is shown in Equation (6). (6) T n ( h + i ) = A Q c + B T n ( h ) + C where, A, B and C is coefficient of formula. T n is indoor dry-bulb temperature, °C. Q c is cooling load, kW. The optimization algorithm in MPC is used to minimize a cost function. The cost function includes a wide range of performance metrics, such as tracking errors, energy consumption, and electricity costs. The indoor temperature control effect and energy-saving goal of RAC systems are taken into account simultaneously. At each sampling time, the sum of the cost functions in the finite time domain is optimized. The optimization time step is determined according to IDT. The cost function is built taking into account the control objective of the regulation model, achieving the set room temperature while minimizing energy consumption. It is written in the form of Equation (7) [43]. In the cost function, two factors are considered, one is the penalty of indoor temperature, and another is the total energy consumption. The penalty of indoor temperature indicates the tracking error cost of the indoor temperature, representing the effect of the room temperature control. The larger the penalty parameter is, the more the indoor temperature deviates from the set value. And the total energy consumption tells the optimal value of the control variable. The weight coefficients λ and γ are set according to the case. Minimizing the cost function under the constraint enables optimal room temperature control and energy efficiency. (7) J ( t ) = ∑ i = 1 P λ · [ z ( t ) − z s ( t + 1 ) ] 2 + γ · ∑ P t o t a l where, J(t) is the cost function. z and z s represent the actual value of room temperature and the set value, respectively, °C. P total is the total power of system operation, kW. λ and γ are the weight coefficients, which can be adjusted to achieve different control effects. For the MPC control strategy, TRNSYS-MATLAB co-simulation is adopted, and communication with MATLAB is realized through Type155 in TRNSYS. Three steps can describe how to set up a simulation model in TRNSYS. 1. First, TRNBUILD was used to establish a hot zone (Zone). 2. Next, set up the cooling terminal in the room by adding an Active Layer (AL). 3. Lastly, the building model made in TRNBuild is imported into the multi-area building module (Type 56) in Simulation Studio and connected to the equipment module based on the exact situation to finish building the simulation model of the RAC system. 3 Case study 3.1 Case description The research building is located in Tianjin (117.2E, 39.13 N), a cold region of northern China with the temperate monsoon climate. It is south-facing orientated and has no shelter around. The main object of this study is the CRAC system, located on the third floor. The total area is about 400 m2, and there are about 30 permanent office crews. The indoor temperature in summer is set at 25 ± 2 °C, and the relative humidity is set at less than or equal to 60%. The air conditioning system adopts the form of the ground-source heat pump (GSHP) and the capillary radiation system. In summer, the actual operation time of the chiller is from 7:00 to 17:00, which is determined by the office hours of the staff. The specific parameters of cold source system equipment are shown in Table 3 . Throughout the experimental process, the primary data collected were the supply and return water temperatures, flow, energy consumption, and inlet and outlet pressures of individual pieces of equipment. The case building is equipped with a building energy monitoring platform and a building automation system, which can partially realize the real-time acquisition, transmission, and storage of air conditioning equipment operating and indoor temperature parameters. In order to collect data for the equipment operating parameters not included in the building automation system big data platform, instruments are used for on-site measurements. The instrumentation used to determine each measurement parameter is listed in Table 4 . Through data preprocessing after the test, a \u2018Mathematical Model Database\u2019 (200 groups of chiller data and 180 groups of circulating pump data) is formed to establish the mathematical model of the equipment. At the same time, a \u2018System Operation Database\u2019 (1500 sets of data) is formed for follow-up load prediction and system optimization control research. 3.2 Delay time testing results 3.2.1 The SPDT testing A typical day in July is selected for the study. On the test day, the chiller starts up at 7:30. Upon startup, the surface temperature of the capillary network decreases dramatically along with the temperature of the water supply and return. In the meantime, the capillary radiation surface becomes a huge low-temperature surface to cool other inner walls by long-wave radiation. Due to the influence of thermal radiation and natural convection, the indoor air temperature also decreases gradually, and the trend is similar to that of the inner surface. After 9:30, the temperature of supply and return water is basically stable, indicating that the temperature of the capillary radiation surface is stable. After that, the indoor air temperature continued to drop until about 11:30, which becomes stable, as clearly shown in Fig. 7 . Therefore, the SPDT is about 4.0 h. Further, the radiation surface temperature climbs rapidly after the system is shut down at 17:30 as water supply and return temperatures increasing. However, the indoor air temperature and the internal surface temperature of the envelope are obviously delayed, and slowly rose at about 19:30. Thanks to the large delay effect of the building system, the capillary radiation terminal can still essentially meet the indoor cooling load of the building and maintain a relatively stable indoor temperature for quite some time (more than 2 h) after the cooling has been turned off. 3.2.2 The IDT testing The IDT in the operating phase is obtained in this research by choosing data on the power of the GSHP, the power of the ground source side circulating pump, and the indoor temperature changing with the time of the system on a typical day, as indicated in Fig. 8 . The time steps recorded by the data are all 10 min. As can be seen from the figure, the power of the ground s1ource side circulating pump is almost always maintained at about 4 kW from 8:00 to 18:00. During this period, the indoor temperature change lags behind the power change of the GSHP, and there are five pairs of turning points. Each pair of turning points has been circled in different colors in the figure, and the corresponding time is about 60 min. Therefore, it can be considered that the IDT in the operating phase of the system, in this case, is 60 min. Therefore, the predicted interval of air conditioning operation load prediction is i' = 60 min. 3.3 Load forecasting model 3.3.1 Input parameters For this paper focusing on the office building, the personnel behavior is very stable, so the cooling and heating load of the building are less affected by internal disturbance. As a consequence, the influence of personnel behavior isn't considered in the input parameters separately. The outdoor dry-bulb temperature (T w ), relative humidity (RH), and horizontal total solar radiation (DZR) are chosen as the input parameters of load prediction model in this work. Meanwhile, aiming at the research objective of this study (controlling indoor temperature), indoor dry-bulb temperature (T n ) was added as an input parameter, and the SRC method was adopted to sort the influence of four parameters on cooling load. The obtained dimensionless coefficients SRC calculated by Equations (4) and (5) are shown in Fig. 9 . Considering that the solar radiation value cannot be obtained from the weather forecast and the principle that the absolute value of SRC is less than 0.2 should be eliminated, this study finally adopts indoor dry-bulb temperature T n , outdoor dry-bulb temperature T w , and historical load Q c as input parameters to simplify the model and improve the calculation speed and prediction accuracy. 3.3.2 Interval determination and modeling Taking into account the delay effect of the system and the thermal inertia of the envelope, the final input parameters for the prediction model are the indoor and outdoor dry-bulb temperature as shown in Table 5 , namely the historical time T n (t-i) and T w (t-i), the current time T n (t) and T w (t), the predicted time T n (t + i\u2019) and T w (t + i\u2019), as well as the average historical load Q c (t-i,t). The value of T n (t + i\u2019) is the room temperature set at the time t + i\u2019. The T w (t + i\u2019) value is obtained from the weather forecast. The output parameter is the predicted load. Based on the IDT, the predicted interval i' has been determined to be 60 min. Considering the thermal inertia of the system and the values of each parameter in the model change only slightly in a short time (such as 10 min), it is recommended that the recording time step of each parameter in the model should be no more than 10 min. Therefore, this paper takes i as 10 min, 20 min, 30 min, 40 min, 50 min, and 60 min, a total of 6 short-term working conditions, to analyze the influence of i's selection on the prediction accuracy of the model. In this study, 720 sets of data are used for training and 240 sets of data are used for testing. The structure of the constructed ANN model for short-term forecasting of air conditioning operating load is depicted in Fig. 10 . The error evaluation indexes of the ANN model test set under six short-term working conditions corresponding to i' = 60 min are shown in Fig. 11 . It is clear that the error indexes of the six working conditions all meet the strictest limitation requirements in the ASHRAE 14\u20132014 standard [60] in the case of i' = 60 min, which proves that the short-term forecast model of air conditioning operating load based on the IDT established in this paper is correct. Among them, the index value corresponding to the historical interval i of 30 min are the smallest, showing the highest prediction accuracy. Therefore, the ANN model corresponding to the working conditions of i = 30 min and i' = 60 min is selected as the short-term forecasting model of the air conditioning operating load of the system in this paper and used in the subsequent research. The comparison between the predicted value and measured value of the established prediction model is shown in Fig. 12 . 3.4 MPC strategy design 3.4.1 Prediction model The short-term air conditioning load prediction model based on the IDT is transformed into the indoor temperature prediction model. The relationship between the predicted room temperature and the current room temperature, and the operating load of air conditioning was obtained. The linear regression was carried out using 960 sets of data. The correlation coefficient of the established indoor temperature prediction model was 0.951. The expression is shown in Equation (8) according to Equation (6). Q c (t,t + i\u2019) is the prediction result of the load prediction model. (8) T n ( t + i \u2032 ) = − 0.04 × Q c ( t , t + i \u2032 ) + 0.94 T n ( t ) + 1.636 A comparison of predicted and measured room temperature is shown in Fig. 13 . The findings indicate that the predicted values of the indoor temperature prediction model correspond well with the measured data, indicating that the model has high prediction accuracy and confirming the model's correctness. Therefore, the indoor temperature prediction model established by appropriately converting the ANN model of air conditioning operating load prediction can be used as the prediction model of MPC to predict the indoor temperature accurately and more easily, also makes the black box model no longer a simple input-output relationship that cannot be elusive. 3.4.2 Cost functions and constraints According to Equation (7), the cost function in this study is finally written in Equation (9). The cost function is built taking into account the control objective of the regulation model, achieving the set room temperature while minimizing energy consumption. Since the control effect of indoor temperature and the energy-saving effect of the system is considered, λ and γ are set to 0.5. (9) J ( t ) = ∑ i = 1 P λ · [ z ( t ) − z s ( t + 1 ) ] 2 + γ · P t o t a l The cost function is the objective function of the optimization algorithm. To take into account system's real state and ensure the simulation works well, the parameter range in the goal function needs to be limited, and the variation range of each parameter needs to be determined based on the system's operation data, as shown in Table 6 . Therefore, the rolling optimization problem in this study can be expressed as Equation (10). Since GA has the advantages of strong nonlinear processing ability and does not have local optimal risk [62], this study utilizes GA to tackle the above-mentioned rolling optimization issue, and sets the population size, maximum iteration number, crossover probability, mutation probability and convergence criteria as 50, 1000, 0.7, 0.01 and 10−6, respectively. The time step of rolling optimization is determined according to IDT, i.e., 1 h as determined by the case-building test in this study. (10) u o p t = a r g m i n J t s . t . { y t = f y t − 1 , u t , u t − 1 T n , min ≤ T n ≤ T n , max u min ≤ u ≤ u max T c o , min ≤ T c o ≤ T c o , max Δ T e , min ≤ Δ T e ≤ Δ T e , max c · M e · Δ T e = Q e Δ T e = T e i − T e o where, u is control variable, namely, T eo and M e in this paper. T ei is water return temperature of chilled water, °C. c is the specific heat capacity, 4.2kJ/(kg °C). 3.5 Simulation testing platform In order to facilitate comparisons of control effects with other control methods and evaluate the effectiveness of each control technology, a TRNSYS simulation model is established in this paper, and the verified model was taken as the controlled object. 3.5.1 Mathematical model Because the establishment of the system simulation model needs to fill in new modules of the energy efficiency model of the GSHP, the mathematical model of the main equipment is established here first. There are many undetermined parameters in the mathematical model of energy efficiency of GSHP, so this paper uses a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to determine the most appropriate value for the model coefficient. The PSO method was run to produce the optimum parameters of the model, and the energy efficiency model of the GSHP was obtained by substituting it into the energy efficiency model formula [63], as shown in Equation (11). (11) C O P = − 2.8477 + 1.5346 · Q e + 2.7227 · Τ e i − 3.4456 · Τ c i + 0.034 · Q e 2 − 0.1950 · Τ e i 2 + 0.2478 · Τ c i 2 + 0.0543 · Q e · Τ e i − 0.2182 · Q e · Τ c i + 0.0333 · Τ e i · Τ c i where, T ci is water return temperature of cooling water, °C. COP is coefficient of performance. Due to the lack of the driving coefficient in the energy consumption model formula of GSHP [64], the regression analysis method is used to complete parameter identification of 200 groups of data in the \u201cMathematical Model Database\u201d. Each group of sample data contains chilled water supply temperature, cooling water supply temperature, the hourly operating power of the chiller, hourly cooling capacity and calculated coefficient of performance. The energy consumption model of the GSHP in this paper is finally determined as shown in Equation (12). (12) P G S H P = − 45.925 + 1.882 Q c − 0.012 Q c 2 − 1.97 × ( T c o − T e o ) + 0.209 × ( T c o − T e o ) 2 − 0.021 Q c × ( T c o − T e o ) where, P GSHP is the power of the ground-source heat pump, kW. Similarly, regression analysis is used to complete parameter identification of the energy consumption models of the PECP and the CCP by using 180 groups of circulating pump data in the \u2018Mathematical Model Database\u2019. Each sample includes the power, flow rate, frequency, and pressure difference between the inlet and outlet of the pump. The energy consumption models of the PECP and the CCP are finally obtained, as shown in Equations (13) and (14), respectively. (13) P b h p u m p = 0.002 · M e 2 − 0.056 · M e + 2.325 (14) P m x p u m p = − 0.02 · M e 2 + 0.349 · M e + 0.471 where, P bhpump is the power of the plate exchange circulating pump, kW. P mxpump is the power of capillary circulation pump, kW. As shown in Fig. 14 , the measured data were chosen and compared to the model's predicted value to see how well it worked. As can be observed, the relative error [65] between the predicted and the measured value of the model is always within 5%, except for a few points. Therefore, the energy efficiency model of the GSHP, the energy consumption model of the GSHP, and the energy consumption model of the circulating pump established in this paper are correct and can be used in subsequent research. Because this research only concerns the user-side CRAC system, and the control is conducted by taking into account the feedback of indoor temperatures, only the optimization control research of the chilled water system is considered. On this basis, the following research on optimizing the system operation of the main energy equipment includes a GSHP, a plate circulating pump, and a CCP. Therefore, the operating power of the system is shown in Equation (15). The cumulative value of the operating power is the operating energy consumption. (15) P t o t a l = P G S H P + P b h p u m p + P m x p u m p = − 45.925 + 1.882 · Q e − 0.012 · Q e 2 − 1.97 · ( T c o − T e o ) + 0.209 · ( T c o − T e o ) 2 − 0.021 · Q e · ( T c o − T e o ) − 0.018 · M e 2 + 0.293 · M e + 2.796 where, P total is the total operation power of system, kW. 3.5.2 Establishment and validation of system simulation model The research object is a three-story room with the radiative end of the capillary tube as the cold source. The parts mentioned above are connected in the same way that the real system's inputs and outputs are, and the resulting simulation model of the system is shown in Fig. 15 . To guarantee the simulation results are valid, this research compares measured indoor temperature values and system operating energy consumption to those simulated to ensure that the equipment module selection and parameter input in the TRNSYS model is accurate. The establishment of this model takes the actual system evidence, and its regulation strategy belongs to empirical control, specifically for the control of fixed water supply temperature and fixed opening time. There is almost no real-time regulation of the operating parameters of the system. This control mode is later referred to as CRBC. Fig. 16 compares between the simulated and measured indoor temperatures from the TRNSYS model. As seen in the graph, the difference between the simulated and measured values was substantial in the first two days. However, with the progress of the simulation, the operating parameters of the system and the indoor thermal environment gradually stabilized. The difference between the simulated and observed indoor temperature values steadily decreased. The main reason for this is that the typical day selected was the first time TRNSYS was simulated, and the actual system had been operating steadily for at least a month before the typical day was selected. To thoroughly assess the model's accuracy, the R2, MAPE, and RMSE error indexes were calculated to be 0.9428, 0.85%, and 0.279 °C, respectively. Therefore, the simulation model is able to reproduce accurately the indoor temperature control effect of the actual air conditioning system, proving that the building of the room model and system model is correct and accurate. The comparison of the TRNSYS model's simulated and measured energy consumption can be seen in Fig. 17 . The TRNSYS simulation model's simulated values of GSHP energy consumption, the PECP, and the CCP are in excellent agreement with the observed values, as shown in the figure. The error indexes are presented in Table 7 . Based on the results, it can be seen that the simulated and measured energy consumption of each piece of equipment exhibits a high degree of correlation. This shows that the TRNSYS model of the CRAC system developed in this study is accurate and can accurately represent how the real system works. In short, the TRNSYS simulation model established in this study is correct and can be used in subsequent optimization control research. 3.5.3 System model based on MPC The embedded controller in the TRNSYS simulation platform can only realize simple control modes such as switch control. To realize the advanced control of the system, it is necessary to connect the TRNSYS simulation platform with the control algorithm. Therefore, this paper establishes a joint simulation platform of TRNSYS and MATLAB to achieve MPC control simulation of the system. The Type155 module in TRNSYS is used to call the MATLAB MPC algorithm to establish the co-simulation model, which is shown in Fig. 18 . The control goal of this study is to keep the indoor temperature as stable as possible during office hours (9:00 to 18:00). The startup time of the system is determined according to SPDT and calculated as 240 min. Therefore, the system starts up 240 min in advance. In addition, the system can still maintain a stable indoor temperature within 2\u20133 h after shutting down, so the system will be shut down in advance. That is, the MPC operation runs from 5:00 to 15:00. 3.5.4 Comparison-system model based on PID To demonstrate the benefits of the MPC algorithm used in the regulation of CRAC systems, this research compared MPC dynamic control approaches using conventional PID and CRBC. This paper sets three parameters of PID control as kp = 0.9, ki = 0.04, and kd = 0.01 according to the trial-and-error method (kp, ki and kd are parameters of PID control). The established TRNSYS simulation model based on PID control is shown in Fig. 19 . 4 Results Taking a typical day in July as an example, the control effects of the three control methods on the system are compared, including the indoor temperature control effect and energy saving effect during office hours (9:00\u201318:00). The meteorological parameters are measured, the indoor temperature control target is set at 25 °C, and the simulation step of the TRNSYS model is 5 min. Due to the fact that the actual system running schedule under CRBC is 7:00 to 17:00, which the system running schedule of the TRNSYS model under CRBC and PID control follow, and the system running schedule is adjusted hourly. Under the MPC strategy, the system starts 240 min in advance, that is, at 5:00 a.m. The operating parameters of the system will reach a stable state at 7:00, so dynamic regulation of the system will be carried out by the MPC method from 8:00, and the system will be shut down in advance at 15:00. Therefore, the prediction horizon of the MPC is 8 h, the control time domain is 1 h, and the sampling time step is set to 1 h. 4.1 Room temperature control effect Fig. 20 indicates the effects of the three control models on indoor temperature control. As seen in the figure, the MPC approach provides more stable indoor temperature performance. The average temperature during office hours is 25.03 °C, which is very close to the set value. The maximum absolute error between the actual value of room temperature and the set value is 0.19 °C. This is because the MPC designed in this study is a feedback method combined with indoor temperature control, which has excellent predictability and effectively improves the matching degree of energy supply and demand as well as the stability of indoor thermal environment control. Under PID control, the average room temperature during office hours is 24.98 °C, the maximum absolute error between the actual value and the set value is 0.24 °C, and the fluctuation of the room temperature is slightly higher. This is because the PID is feedback control, constantly adjusted with the deviation, fluctuating a lot. CRBC shows the worst effect on indoor temperature. The average value of the room temperature during office hours is 23.96 °C, which is far less than the temperature set value. The maximum absolute error between the actual value and the set value is 1.26 °C, and the indoor temperature fluctuates the most. The main reason for this is that at room temperature, CRBC cannot conduct the load prediction and feedback regulation. The regulation model based on the MPC method runs smoothly for 2 h after the system is started at 5:00, and the indoor temperature has been controlled to a certain extent by 7:00. After dynamic control of the system from 8:00, the indoor temperature stabilizes at 25 °C after about 30 min. PID control starts the system at 7:00 and adjusts the operating parameters hour by hour from 8:00. The initial indoor temperature fluctuates greatly but gradually decreases over time. After about 5 h, the indoor temperature is controlled at about 25 °C. Therefore, compared with PID control, the MPC method has a shorter overshoot time and higher stability for room temperature control. And the indoor temperature under CRBC has not reached the set value and even appears to be in a supercooled state. It should be noted that the indoor temperature will always fluctuate, so this study believes that temperature control within the range of 25 ± 0.2 °C is to achieve a stable state. In addition, after 5:00 in the summer, the indoor temperature will rise with the influence of outdoor meteorological parameters. It can also be seen from the figure that the indoor temperature at 7:00 is significantly higher than that at 5:00. Therefore, starting the system at 5:00 with the MPC method can reduce the heat storage of the building in time, thus reducing the energy consumption of the system starting up. In order to further compare the control effects of the three methods on indoor temperature, the MAPE and RMSE indexes were used for error evaluation, as shown in Table 8 . It is evident that both the MAPE and RMSE indexes of the MPC method are the smallest, followed by PID control, and the error under CRBC is the largest. The room temperature stability of the MPC method is 18.8% higher than that of PID control and 63.5% higher than that of CRBC. MPC dynamic control is the most efficient method of indoor temperature control. During office hours, the room temperature is closest to the set value, with the least amount of temperature change and the most accurate control. 4.2 Energy-saving effect Fig. 21 displays the energy consumption of the principal energy-consuming equipment of three control approaches. As can be observed, the power consumption trend of the PECP is similar for the three control approaches, owing to the fact that the circulating pump is a constant frequency pump, invalidating the apparent energy-saving impact of variable flow regulation. The capillary circulation pump is a frequency conversion pump, so the power change is more obvious due to the adjustment of the flow rate. Among them, the change of PID control is particularly obvious, mainly because the PID control method, including feedback, will magnify the deviation, resulting in a slightly more frequent and violent adjustment of the equipment and parameter fluctuation. For the GSHP, it is obvious that the power consumption based on PID control and the MPC method is higher in the startup process, while the power consumption of CRBC is higher in the afternoon. Combined with the indoor temperature change curve, it's apparent that the indoor temperature under CRBC is gradually rising from 12:00 to 16:00, as well as the outdoor temperature during this period. Therefore, it makes sense for an experience-based control to increase cooling during this period. Additionally, the figure indicates that the power consumption peak of the chiller occurs between 12:00 and 14:00. However, due to the delay effect of the system and the decline of the outdoor temperature, the indoor temperature gradually decreases after 16:00 and then returns to the supercooled state, which is not suitable for the air-conditioning system with a large time delay. At the initial stage of cooling, since there is a large deviation between the indoor temperature and the set value, the power of the GSHP and the PID control model is greater than the MPC model. Later, as time goes on, the deviation gradually decreases, and the power also decreases. In general, the power of each device in the MPC regulation model has the gentlest change, and the power is also low most of the time. The system can still maintain a relatively stable indoor temperature after the shutdown at 15:00. This is because, on the one hand, the indoor temperature has been well controlled before the system shuts down, so it does not require excessive cooling load to maintain stability. On the other hand, the outdoor temperature gradually decreases after 15:00, and the heat storage of the envelope can offset the cooling load provided by the system at 15:00. Therefore, the dynamic control of the system based on the MPC method can make full use of the delay effect of the system and the predictability of the MPC method so that the control parameters can change smoothly, the system equipment can run smoothly, and the cooling capacity can be fully utilized to reduce energy waste. Fig. 22 demonstrates the cumulative energy usage of the three control methods during 24 h. As can be observed, the energy consumption of GSHP accounts for a significant amount of the energy used by the three control techniques. The energy consumption of each device is kept to a minimum in the regulatory model based on the MPC approach. The energy consumption of all the equipment controlled by CRBC is the largest, except for the capillary circulation pump. To further demonstrate the improvement of the system control model based on the MPC approach described in this work. Table 9 compares the relative errors of cumulative energy consumption for different methodologies. It can be seen that the MPC method can save energy by 14.89% compared with the CRBC and 8.51% energy compared with the PID control. Therefore, compared with CRBC and PID control, MPC can not only meet the indoor temperature control requirements but also reduce energy consumption. To sum up, the regulation model based on the MPC method has a good effect on the control of the indoor thermal environment and energy-saving optimization of air conditioning systems and is suitable for the operation optimization control of CRAC systems. 5 Discussion Heat transfer in the CRAC system involves a number of complicated mechanisms. There are long-wave radiation heat transfer processes between the capillary and the ceiling, also the ceiling and the indoor air. The combination of capillary and building envelope makes it a great capacity for heat storage, which leads to a great delay between indoor temperature fluctuation and system regulation. For the other terminals of RAC systems, it is similar to the unsteady heat transfer problem of the indoor thermal environment. Because of this, the delay effect of radiant systems cannot be ignored. Based on the delay time of the system, a series of studies on the control model of the RAC systems are carried out in this paper. On the one hand, the prediction interval of the load forecasting model is determined based on the IDT, which facilitates the understanding of load changes at the next time step and thus regulates in advance, avoiding the problem of load mismatch caused by time delays. On the other hand, rolling optimization with the objective of minimizing room temperature penalties and energy consumption, obtaining optimal values for the water supply temperature and flow rate. The rolling optimization step time is determined by the IDT. The feedback correction is carried out by applying the actual and set values of the indoor temperature to the prediction model. In addition, the SPDT determines the operation moment of the MPC strategy. The strategies mentioned above constitute the MPC regulation model of the CRAC system. This research provides an idea and method to establish the control model of the RAC system based on the delay time, which can be applied to the regulation of RAC system in buildings or rooms with different working conditions. This effectively solves the problem of inadequate or overshoot regulation due to large time delays and enables more accurate regulation. The utilization of the MPC strategy to solve the problem of time delay regulation during the operation of the RAC system is discussed in this paper. Therefore, the system delay parameters in the start-up process are mainly obtained by the experimental tests. The delay time of the start-up process of the system will be studied by modeling and analysis, so as to establish a sound model for the regulation of the start-up process. In addition, the study case in this paper is an office building with stable personnel behaviors. For buildings with high personnel flows and erratic behaviors, such as mall buildings, personnel behaviors should be taken into account in the load forecasting models to capture trends in indoor thermal disturbances. 6 Conclusion In this study, the operation optimization control method of the CRAC system is analyzed. Aiming at the problems such as the mismatch between supply and demand of energy and the inability to control system parameters accurately caused by the large time delay of the system, an MPC dynamic regulation model considering the system delay effect is proposed to predict indoor temperature. The simulation model of the actual system is established using TRNSYS software to observe the control effect, so as to reflect the superiority of the MPC method. The conclusions of this study are as follows. (1) Accurate load prediction is a prerequisite for realizing optimal control of system operation. In this study, an ANN air conditioning operating load short-term forecasting model based on the IDT is built on the basis of completely considering the effect of the delay system. By using indoor dry bulb temperature and average load as input parameters, the prediction accuracy of the model is improved through unequal intervals, and the mismatch between energy supply and demand is reduced from the source. (2) A dynamic regulation model for CRAC systems based on the MPC method was established. The SPDT is used to guide the system startup time. And the optimization step time of MPC is determined according to the IDT. Aiming at the control objectives of this paper, the indoor temperature prediction model is established and combined with GA to achieve rolling optimization. The TRNSYS model of the system is established as the feedback control effect of the controlled object. The MPC approach is implemented by combining TRNSYS and MATLAB simulation models. The efficiency of the regulation model based on the MPC approach is shown by comparison to the CRBC and PID control models. The results present that the MPC method not only shows a better indoor temperature control effect but also reduces the total energy consumption of the system operation. The room temperature stability of the MPC method is 18.8% higher than that of PID control and 63.5% higher than that of CRBC. Compared with CRBC, energy consumption can be reduced by 14.89%.

        "dc:description": "Radiant air conditioning (RAC) systems are widely used because of the advantage of higher thermal comfort compared to convection systems. However, RAC systems exhibit considerable hysteresis and significant time delays in heat transmission from the terminal to the interior environment. Traditional feedback control methods do not adequately account for the system's delay impact while implementing dynamic control, resulting in a mismatch between supply and demand loads in time series, an inefficient impact of interior temperature control, and energy waste. According to this study, the time-delay characteristics of the RAC system are quantified by the startup-process delay time (SPDT) and operating-phase integrated delay time (IDT). The system startup time is set by the SPDT. Based on the IDT, the prediction interval of the model predictive control (MPC) and the step time of rolling optimization are determined. On this basis, a short-term forecasting model of air conditioning operating load and the regulation model of the system using MPC are established and verified by comparing with the conventional rule-based control of constant water temperature (CRBC) and proportionally-integral-differential (PID) control. The results for the RAC system with a large time delay indicate that the stability of indoor temperature under MPC controlling is 18.8% higher than the PID control and 63.5% higher than the CRBC method. Also, the indoor temperature controlled by the MPC is closest to the set value and shows the minimum fluctuation. Furthermore, the overall energy consumption of the system is estimated for reducing by 14.89% in comparison with the CRBC and by 8.51% in comparison with the PID.",
