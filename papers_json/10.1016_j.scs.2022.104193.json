Building Energy Research Center, School of Architecture Tsinghua University Beijing 100084 China Occupant's movement in buildings is one of the most essential factors that influence building energy consumption. Understanding the movement of occupants in buildings is crucial for building design and operations. The advances in virtual reality (VR), especially immersive virtual environments (IVEs), offer new and cost-effective alternatives for occupant behavior studies in unbuilt buildings at design phase and establishing controlled experimental scenarios. This paper presents a general framework for the investigation, analysis, and modelling of the horizontal and vertical movements of occupants in buildings using IVE experimental platform. We first established an IVE experimental platform and conduct the experiment in IVE platform to observe occupant horizontal and vertical movement in buildings. The collected experimental data were then used to statistically analyze and extract key features of the occupant's vertical and horizontal movement patterns, based on which a set of agent-based models (ABMs) are built to simulate stochastic occupant's horizontal and vertical movement patterns in buildings. The proposed method can efficiently capture the occupants\u2019 movement patterns, therefore creating more realistic ABMs for simulation. The proposed method provides an efficient approach to utilizing IVE technology for occupant movement pattern observations and modeling horizontal and vertical moving patterns for advanced building design and management.

According to the International Energy Agency (IEA, 2019), buildings account for 30% of the total global energy consumption. Recently, researchers have studied in-depth measures to improve building energy performance (Fan et al., 2020), including high-performance heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems (Pérez-Lombard et al., 2011), building envelopes (Sadineni et al., 2011) occupant behavior (Zhang et al., 2018), etc. Previous studies have developed various physics-based models for HVAC systems. The simulation results of these models agree well with the actual performance (Chen & Treado, 2014). Similarly, scholars have also proved that modeling building-thermal processes using major simulation tools fits well with the buildings' real thermal performance (Yan et al., 2022). Nevertheless, occupant behavior in buildings appears to be changeable and complex, accounting for significant uncertainty in building energy demands. The example of 62 Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certified buildings suggests that an averaged normalized relative error of 18% exists between the simulated energy consumption of a building and its actual energy use, owing to the variation in occupant behavior (Turner et al., 2008). The stochastic feature of occupant behavior is a major challenge in predicting building energy use (Gunay et al., 2013). Moreover, occupant behavior has an energy-saving potential of 10%\u201325% for residential buildings and 5%\u201330% for commercial buildings (Zhang et al., 2018). Thus, occupant energy-related behavior is considered to be one of the most influential and complicated factors affecting the total energy consumption in buildings (Dong et al., 2022; Muroni et al., 2019). Distinct modes of occupant behavior lead to an unignorably discrepancy in energy profiles, even in the same buildings (Hong & Lin, 2012), affecting the building design and/or control strategies (Ouf et al., 2020; Tang et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2022). The irregular and partial occupancy in different zones influences the building energy consumption (Park et al., 2019). Scholars have investigated the various occupant presence, such as zonal occupancy and vacancy time distributions (D'Oca & Hong, 2015), to understand the building performance. Thus, to improve the accuracy and reliability of building performance simulations, it is essential to understand occupant behavior patterns in buildings (Kang et al., 2021). Over the past decade, occupant behavior has attracted extensive research interest. The impact of occupant behavior on buildings is widely acknowledged from two aspects: The presence of occupants in buildings (Jin, Yan, Chong, 2021) and the occupants\u2019 interactions with building appliances and equipment (Yu et al., 2011). The presence of occupants in buildings mainly refers to the occupant movement indoor. It is a cognitive process of navigation, which involves goal setting, strategy selection (use of spatial knowledge), perception, assessment, and movement (Darken & Peterson, 2001). Many scholars have conducted theoretical studies of occupant movement (Jamshidi & Pati, 2020), such as cognitive map theory(Tolman, 1948), direct perception theory(Gibson, 1979), etc. Field researches have been carried out to explore the occupant movement in real life to explore the inner mechanism (Ben-Elia, 2021). Existed studies have unveiled several drivers and patterns behind occupant movement. Yet for building energy simulation, in-depth investigations on occupant movement and indoor behavior are definite to be conducted. 1.1 Current approaches of observing and modeling occupant behavior in buildings To investigate occupant behavior patterns, appropriate data collection and modelling technique are required (Salim et al., 2020). There are three commonly-adopted approaches for occupant behavior data collection: observational studies, survey-based studies, and laboratory studies (Yan et al., 2015). Besides, the current modelling techniques for occupant behavior studies are usually divide into stochastic/probabilistic models, statistical models and agent-based models (Dong et al., 2021; Li et al., 2019). Stochastic/probabilistic models can reflect the randomness of occupant behavior by characterizing its time-dependency probability (Jin, Yan, Kang, 2021) while statistical models generally refer to regression methods to quantitatively describe the relationship between influencing factors to occupant behavior (Li et al., 2019). Agent-based models are one of the latest modelling techniques in occupant behavior field, which describe each agent with individual features, perceptions, and interactions (Gilbert, 2019). For observational studies, environmental sensors are adopted to detect occupant behavior and these data are suitable for probabilistic modelling techniques. Ren et al. (2014) conducted a field studies in 34 households to monitor occupants\u2019 air-conditioning behavior in China and established corresponding behavior models through stochastic methods. Tanimoto and Hagishima (2005) investigated several residential apartments on their appliance use behavior and adopted Markov Chain method to modelling occupant behavior. Researchers have conducted longitudinal field tests to observe occupants\u2019 appliance use behavior (Jin et al., 2020). Lan et al. (2022) used on-site cameras to record occupant movement in a railway station and analyzed occupant movement's impact on the inner environment. And Zhang et al. (2021) adopted PIR sensors to locate occupants and proposed models to simulate occupant indoor activities. The observational method is a relatively non-invasive approach using the emerging remote sensor technologies (Gilani & O'Brien, 2017). This helps researchers acquire authentic occupant responses and actions in buildings. However, the data collection is usually time consuming and confronts various data issues, such as potential missing data (Gilani & O'Brien, 2017), occurrences of uncertain events (Gunay et al., 2013), and personal privacy issues (Laaroussi et al., 2020). For survey-based studies, occupancy data is often acquired from interviews or questionnaires. Yao and Zhao (2017) adopted survey-based studies to construct a regression model of occupants\u2019 window opening behavior Similarly, researchers in Greece used a structured questionnaire to collect residential end-user behavior data and identified six energy use patterns based on socioeconomic factors included in surveys (Vogiatzi et al., 2018). Therefore, the approach can unveil the predominant behavioral characteristics or motivations of occupants\u2019 actions and assess the influences of factors through statistical models; however, deviations usually exist because participants may misrepresent or misinterpret their behavior (Yan et al., 2015). Privacy concerns is also a controversial issue in survey-based studies (Panacek, 2008). With regard to the conventional laboratory approach, climate chambers and existing buildings are usually adopted to observe occupant behavior in a controlled environment or under specific circumstances. Chen et al. (2016) conducted chamber experiments to validate the benefits of using occupant feedback for thermal control. Therefore, laboratory studies are often adopted to find occupant's behavioral rules under certain occurrences and do not often output corresponding behavior models. In laboratory studies, environmental variables can be strictly controlled according to the experimental design. However, occupants in laboratories may not behave as they would in original living environment, known as Hawthorne Effect (Gilani & O'Brien, 2017). Moreover, conventional laboratory approaches using specified chambers or rooms usually incur higher costs, both time and financial (Gilani & O'Brien, 2017). 1.2 IVE-based researches of occupant movements and interactions in buildings Current researchers are exploring virtual reality (VR) technologies as a solution for sampling occupant behavior data efficiently and economically under controlled environments. Virtual reality (VR) is a computer-generated digital environment in which users can interact or participate in real-seeming environments (Jerald, 2015). Based on this feature, VR technology has been applied as an experimental platform to create certain situations for studies in different fields, including sociology (Grinberg et al., 2014), psychology (Christiansen et al., 1998), medicine (Serrano et al., 2013), etc. With the development of technology, VR has evolved into three types of systems: non-immersive (e.g., VR desktops), semi-immersive (e.g., projection-based displays), and fully-immersive (e.g., head-mounted displays) (Bowman & McMahan, 2007). Semi or fully immersive virtual environments (IVEs) have often been adopted in human-related studies in recent years. In contrast to traditional occupant behavior study approaches, IVEs have obvious advantages in creating non-existing platforms or un-built environment, controlling experimental situations by eliminating unwanted noises, and reducing the cost of both time and money for longitudinal studies (Heydarian et al., 2015). Therefore, IVEs recently have been a popular choice when investigating occupant behavior. Generally, IVE-based occupant behavior studies involve two perspectives: the occupants\u2019 wayfinding behavior in buildings and their interactions with the built environment. IVEs are often used to create different scenarios and circumstances to investigate occupant movements. The impact of gender differences (Sandstrom et al., 1998) and age (Jansen et al., 2007) on wayfinding behavior have been studied through IVEs. Lokka and Çöltekin (2017) used IVEs to investigate the influence of different degrees of design realism on human spatial-learning abilities. Similarly, the effect of different visual attention patterns, including IVE, 3D, and 2D, on occupants\u2019 ability to acquire spatial knowledge has been studied by Shi et al. (2020). Besides, IVEs have been used as a medium to investigate the impact of distinct stair configurations on the occupants\u2019 vertical navigation ability (Memikoğlu & Demirkan, 2020). Kim and Rhiu (2021) have applied IVEs to figure out the effects of different navigation interfaces for occupants. Patterns of pedestrian movement in cities have been studied from an urban level using IVE-based experiments (Meilinger et al., 2008; Natapov & Fisher-Gewirtzman, 2016). In addition to wayfinding behaviors under ordinary scenarios, IVEs are also applied to investigate wayfinding behavior during emergencies, such as fire evacuation (Cao et al., 2019; Duarte et al., 2014; Kobes et al., 2010), crowdedness (Li et al., 2019; Lin et al., 2020; Moussaïd et al., 2018), mental stress (Lin et al., 2019), social influence (Kinateder et al., 2014) and so on. The other aspect of IVE-based occupant behavior studies is occupant interactions with building appliances and systems and their impact on energy use in different scenarios. Heydarian and Becerik-Gerber (2017) used IVEs to explore the influence of manual and semi-automatic control systems as well as the impact of default lighting settings on occupant lighting-control strategies (2016). Niu et al. (2015) used IVEs to verify the impact of energy-saving building designs on occupant behavior. Some scholars have adopted IVE-based experiments to explore the effects of windows on occupants in buildings, such as the window size (Hong et al., 2019) and the distance from the window (Abd-Alhamid et al., 2020). The possibility of using IVEs for thermal comfort studies has been conducted (Yeom et al., 2019; 2017). Other studies have primarily verified the feasibility of using IVEs as experimental platforms to collect occupant behavior data. Chokwitthaya et al. (2017) confirmed the occupant-perceived lighting discrepancy between IVEs and in situ experiments. Recently, Chokwitthaya et al. (2020) proposed an augmented building performance model using an IVE experimental platform to collect occupant behavior data. Saeidi et al. (2018) proposed a spatial-temporal event-driven (STED) modeling approach and proved that this model effectively represented occupant behavior both in IVE and in situ experiments, which implies that it is reliable to carry out experiments in IVEs over a relatively short term instead of longitudinal observational studies in some conditions. It is notable from the above-mentioned reviews that the spatial scale may vary in different types of IVE-based occupant behavior studies. For wayfinding studies, the spatial scale of studies can be observed from a single building to an entire city. For occupant interactions studies, IVE experiments were mainly conducted on a room scale. Another indispensable feature of IVE studies is the design of the stimuli. The key to IVE experiments is to provide a high level of immersion, which is largely dependent on high-level sensory stimuli (Bowman & McMahan, 2007). Both wayfinding and interaction studies have implemented visual stimuli in IVEs. Acoustic stimuli are sometimes applied in studies related to fire evacuation to make the situation more realistic. Also, thermal stimuli often appear in thermal comfort related studies. However, haptic and olfactory stimuli have rarely been observed in existed IVE-based occupant behavior studies. Different researchers design different features in IVEs for their specific objectives. Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the reviewed studies from three perspectives: common applications, spatial resolutions, and input stimuli and Fig. 1 demonstrates an overview of current IVE-based studies and related aspects. In terms of the listed aspects, it is feasible and reliable to apply IVEs as an experimental technique in occupant behavior studies. 1.3 Agent-based modeling of occupant movement patterns in buildings Agent-Based Model (ABM) is the suitable modelling technique for IVE-based occupant behavior experiments (Malik et al., 2022). ABM simulates occupants with personal attributes and behavioral possibilities (Macal & North, 2010), nowadays has been commonly adopted when establishing occupant model based on collected behavioral data. It is a bottom-up modelling technique consisting of dynamically interacting discrete agents (Niazi, 2016) which can interact with each other and with the environment, reflecting human decision-making and problem-solving process (Chen, 2012). Many researchers have used ABMs for energy and environment performance of buildings, such as design, operations and controls, retrofit and others (Malik et al., 2022). Especially in occupant movement simulation, ABMs have been investigated in-depth during recent years. Dziedzic et al. (2020) have established an agent-based model to simulate occupant natural movement inside a known building layout instead simply finding the shortest pathway. Lee and Malkawi (2014) have investigated various occupant behavior including activity level, heat/fan us, window use, blind use and clothes worn in an office building and established the corresponding ABM to reflect how occupants balance and make decisions of their thermal adaptive behavior. Similarly, based on the data from a one-year field study in a medium-sized office, ABM of occupant individual interactions with building devices is created by Langevin et al. (2015) according to Perceptual Control Theory (Powers, 1973) and the study also validates the established ABM results with on-site data. Jia et al. (2019) have adopted a physiological and psychological-based tool to build ABM to simulate occupant behaviors in offices and the ABM is more elaborated featuring personal value systems. Another study conducted by Chandra Putra et al. (2017) also develops ABM based on the module implemented in NetLogo to simulate occupant comfort and adaptive behaviors in the office. From above, ABM built in existed studies are usually depended on developed modeling tools, such as MATLAB (Langevin et al., 2015), NetLogo (Chandra Putra et al., 2017), PMFserv (Jia et al., 2019), Anylogic (Muravev et al., 2021), etc. Video game engine (e.g. Unreal Engine and Unity 3D), which is adopted in IVE-based studies, is also a cross-simulation platform for multi-agent simulation in buildings with the advanced visualization feature (Malik et al., 2022). This platform shows incomparable advantages in establishing ABM for occupant path-finding, multi-agent behaviors and interactions (Malik et al., 2022). Therefore, by conducting experiments in IVEs to acquire behavioral data, ABMs can be further incorporated into IVE platforms, thus simulating and visualizing the occupant behavior. Previous studies have laid the foundation for IVE-based occupant behavior experiments related to occupants\u2019 wayfinding behavior and their interactions with built environments. Furthermore, ABM studies have also revealed the potential of applying ABM to model occupant behavior in building performance simulation. However, very few existing studies have investigated the typical patterns and features of occupants\u2019 decision-making processes and movements in vertical and horizontal movement processes in buildings through IVE-based experiments. Moreover, there are seldom studies to establish corresponding ABMs based on the collected behavioral data in IVEs and present occupant behavior in a way of visualization. Therefore, this study primarily proposes an overall technical framework to establish ABM by collecting occupant behavioral data using IVEs as the experimental platform. Taking occupants\u2019 horizontal and vertical movement behavior as the topic, the study realizes the main procedures of constructing ABM based on IVE, including data collection, statistical analysis and model development. The occupants\u2019 vertical movement in this study refers to the decision to use stairs or elevators when moving between different floors, while horizontal movement means occupants\u2019 wayfinding behavior to locate and move between different rooms on the same floor. Based on the data collected from the IVE experiments, several features of occupants\u2019 movement are analyzed and extracted as the input of ABMs, therefore further establishing ABMs to simulate and reoccur occupant movement patterns. The proposed ABM method and framework offer a new perspective for generating occupant behavior model through acquiring occupancy data using IVEs, which can be further applied in acquisition of zonal occupancy distribution. With more accurate and realistic occupancy in buildings as input, building performance simulation can be conducted more validly. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 proposes a novel framework for establishing ABMs for the occupants\u2019 horizontal and vertical movements based on IVE platforms. Section 3 analyzes the experimental results and illustrates the modelling results of ABMs in the virtual building. Section 4 and Section 5 provide a discussion of the potential applications of ABMs and current limitations of IVE-based occupant behavior studies, and some concluding remarks, respectively. 2 Methodology The technical approach for studying the vertical and horizontal movements of occupants in buildings with IVEs consists of three major steps: (1) Design of IVE-based platforms and experiments, (2) Statistical analysis of occupant's horizontal and vertical movements, (3) Development of ABM for occupant movements. The overall technical approach used in this study is illustrated in Fig. 2 . 2.1 Design of IVE-based platforms and experiments 2.1.1 IVE platforms An HTC VIVE head-mounted display (HMD) VR system was used for the experiments. This enabled participants to have a 360-degree virtual view (Niehorster et al., 2017). The VIVE system consists of a headset, two hand controllers, two infrared laser-emitter units and an AGlass eye tracker (Fig. 3 ). This set of VR system is able to provide participants with realistic immersive experience and large working range (Borrego et al., 2018), which has been often adopted in IVE-based occupant way-finding studies (Lin et al., 2019). Since this study focused on investigating the occupant's horizontal and vertical movement regularity, two virtual buildings were established for the IVE-based experiments. For horizontal movement, to avoid a potential bias for a familiar spatial environment, an office building that was unfamiliar to all participants was adopted. The virtual building is a four-story building with a gross area of 1,650 m2. Basic signs and landmarks in the building were included in the IVE to allow participants to search for their destinations. For the vertical movement strategy, a virtual high-rise model was built, containing both elevators and stairs for participants to choose. The prototype of the high-rise building is a 13-story office building on a university campus in China, with 11 stories above ground and 2 stories underground. This building was built in 2001, with 32,553 m 2 in total and 45 m in height. The 3D building model used for horizontal and vertical movement experiments are different, since horizontal movement experiment requires non-existing built environment, while vertical movement experiment requires existing high-rise building. Creating the virtual models of these buildings includes three steps: (1) setting up coarse models of the building layout using the SketchUp 3D modeling software, (2) rendering the 3D models in the 3ds Max animating software, and (3) importing and modifying the virtual models in the Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) real-time 3D creation platform. The virtual models for both horizontal and vertical experiments are shown in Fig. 4 . 2.1.2 Experiment design In order to investigate the characteristics of occupant's vertical and horizontal movement in buildings, the experiments for vertical and horizontal movements are designed respectively. For the experiment of occupant's decision-making regarding vertical movement, concrete scenarios are designed for the IVEs. Several key factors that influenced the occupants\u2019 decision-making processes were observed in advance through a preliminary online questionnaire (Appendix A). According to the questionnaire results from 275 subjects (159 females and 116 males), the top four driven factors included: (1) the target floor (number of floors between the current and target floor), (2) time pressure (time limits to reach the target floor), (3) crowdedness (number of people waiting for the elevator), and (4) elevator status (arriving at or leaving the current floor). The components and scenarios in the IVE were designed specifically to reflect these four factors. A total of 12 scenarios were designed for vertical movement experiment by combining different statuses of the four key factors. Originally, two statuses were designated for each of the four factors: The target floor was the third or sixth floor, the time pressure was five minutes or unlimited, the crowdedness was crowded or vacant, and the elevator status was leaving or arriving. These combine to a total of 16 scenarios. The crowdedness in the scenario is designed as 10 people waiting in front of the elevator based on the real situations in the building, where mostly ten occupants would be there at the morning rush hour. The settings of the target floor are based on the results of the pre-questionnaires, where the 6th floor is the highest floor that people would take stairs and the 3rd floor is the lowest floor that people would use elevators. Owing to the limited number of recruited participants and because of the results of pre-questionnaires, more than 90% of the subjects demonstrate an obvious inclination for taking elevator in specific scenarios with target floor at 6th floor and uncrowded waiting people. The four scenarios are excluded in the test scenarios and the number of scenarios was pruned to 12 for the subsequent vertical movement experiment, focusing on those ambiguous scenarios. Table 2 listed the settings of the 12 scenarios. For the experiment on the occupant's horizontal movement, the virtual environment was set up for participants to search for signs and information and reach a destination inside the building. The IVE records the participants\u2019 movement traces and points of sight to understand the occupants\u2019 cognition and movement. Apart from the design of the experimental scenarios, other details, such as the walking speed and elevator speed in the IVE, were set according to real-life experiences. A pilot study was conducted in a real building prior to the experiment. Five participants were randomly chosen to walk horizontally or go upstairs or downstairs. Their speeds were recorded and the average walking speed was set in the IVE. Similarly, the operating speed of elevator was also recorded in the real building, shown as Table 3. This ensures that the settings of the parameters in the IVE are sufficiently close to the occupant's experience in reality. 2.1.3 Experiment procedures 83 participants (mean: 20.41 years old, 46 males and 37 females) were recruited to participate in the experiments. Most of the participants were undergraduate students. All of them had normal vision or corrected-to-normal vision, which excluded the possibility of visual-perception difficulties in the IVEs. All participants have been informed the purpose and the procedure of the experiment, as well as the potential risks of dizziness in VR environments, and have signed a form of consent before the formal experiment. To ensure feasibility, all the participants were asked to perform a 3D test to avoid the potential risks of VR sickness and improve the immersion in the IVE. After completing the above procedures, the 83 participants were randomly assigned to different experimental scenarios. The complete experiment consisted of four sessions: pre-questionnaire, training, formal experiment (including horizontal and vertical movement), and post-questionnaire. The pre-questionnaire session (2\u20135 min, see Appendix A for pre-questionnaire) was designed to collect basic information about the participants, including their age, eyesight condition, and potential IVE sickness problems. The training session (5\u201310 min) was intended to help the participants get familiar with the IVEs. In this session, the participants were guided to calibrate their eye movements with the eye-tracking system. Then, they were asked to practice walking, interact with the elevator, and go up and down the stairs in the IVE, which helped them to become familiar with the virtual environment. In the IVE, participants are required to swing their arms in order to move forward and walk upstairs. The training session allows participants to get familiar with this walking mechanism and establish a direct recognition of the deterrent of walking and going upstairs in IVE. After the training session, the participants started the formal experiment session (8\u201315 minutes) and completed several specific tasks in the IVEs. In the vertical movement experiment, different participants were asked to reach a specified target floor under different scenarios. Their choice and corresponding driven factors in the scenario were recorded as the output data of experiments. In the horizontal movement experiment, participants were required to search for a specific room in the building. The tracks of the participant's movements and eye-sight points were recorded during the formal experiment. The data in this phase were used for analysis in the following procedures. In the last session, a post-questionnaire and an interview (1\u20133 minutes, see Appendix B for post-questionnaire) were conducted. The participants were asked what factors influenced their behavior or strategies in the experiments. Moreover, the occupants could tell the interviewer which design elements or settings in the building helped or hindered them from finishing the tasks. 2.2 Statistical analysis of occupant's horizontal and vertical movements 2.2.1 Horizontal movement patterns For horizontal movement, the outputs of the experiments were the participants\u2019 chronological routes during the experiment, which are their locations in IVE coordinate system recorded second by second. To identify the typical wayfinding patterns of the occupants, we transformed the original data into an array of durations of stay. The public area of a single floor was divided into six zones, according to their functions, as shown in Fig. 5 . The track of the occupant's movements was then processed into an array of the occupant's duration of stay in each zone; therefore, a six-dimensional array was formed to represent the horizontal movement pattern for each participant. This array represents the occupants\u2019 stay time length in each function zone and reflects their movement patterns in the horizontal movement experiment. The duration-of-stay arrays of all 83 participants were clustered into groups to identify the typical movement patterns. The K-means algorithm was adopted for clustering. K-means is a commonly used distance-based clustering algorithm that sorts all samples into several groups to minimize their within-cluster distances. The definition of \u201cdistance\u201d in K-means is quite flexible. In most cases, including this research, the Euclidean distance is adopted. The Calinski-Harabasz index (CHI) was introduced to determine the number of clusters. CHI is an internal criterion that is commonly used to evaluate different clustering results on the same set of samples. This can be expressed by the following equation: (1) C H I ( k ) = t r ( B k ) × ( m − k ) t r ( W k ) × ( k − 1 ) , where k refers to the number of clusters, m refers to the number of samples, tr() refers to the trace of the matrix, Bk is a matrix that represents the between-cluster dispersion, and Wk is a matrix that represents the within-cluster dispersion. CHI(k) refers to the Calinski-Harabasz index of the k clusters. A greater CHI represents a better clustering result. In this study, the algorithm iterates the number of clusters in a range of [2,10] and the number of clusters with the highest CHI is selected. Our clustering analysis distinguishes different types of occupants, based on their duration of stay in each zone. Within each type, we used a logarithmic distribution to fit the duration of stay in each zone, among all the samples. For each type, six distribution functions were established for the durations of stay in the six zones. The distribution function represents the features of an occupant's horizontal movements in the buildings. 2.2.2 Vertical movement features The key issue was the probability of the occupants choosing an elevator or using stairs under different scenarios. The probability was associated with the driven factors, including the target floor, time pressure, crowdedness, and elevator status. Thus, this section uses logistic regression to determine the correlation between the probability of choosing the elevator, considering the above driven factors. Logistic regression is a commonly used model for regressing binary dependent variables. This model is based on a logistic function, which is a linear form for binary variables. The function of the logistic model is expressed by the : (2) l = log 10 p 1 − p = β 0 + β 1 x 1 + β 2 x 2 + . . . This equation considers a binary variable Y and its multiple predictors xi . In this equation, l is the log-odds of the event Y=1, p is the probability of event Y=1, and βi represent the coefficients of the model. The regressed logistic function correlates the probability of choosing elevators with the above-mentioned factors, and will be applicable for inferring this probability under other scenarios. In the experiment stage, we can derive participants\u2019 vertical decision and the scenario they were in. For each participant, a set of data including his/her vertical movement, the target floor, time pressure, crowdedness, and elevator status is acquired. In total, 83 sets of data are inputted into the logistic regression function to determine occupants\u2019 probability of vertical movement with four driven factors. 2.3 Development of agent-based model for occupant movements To simulate the occupants\u2019 overall movement in the buildings, ABMs were developed to reconstruct the occupants\u2019 vertical and horizontal movements and decisions. Based on the ODD protocol of ABM (Grimm et al., 2010), the established ABMs could be documented including Overview, Design Concepts and Details. In this study, the overview of the ABM is to simulate occupant movement in building scale with considerations of environmental factors inside building environment. As to the design concepts of ABMs, for the horizontal movement, it is concluded as extracting and reflecting typical traits influenced by the functions of building zones while for the vertical movement, the impacts of key scenario variables are investigated when occupant move vertically. The ABMs are established through the \u201cAI character\u201d module in UE4, which helps to build behavioral logic for virtual agents, especially the behavior-tree map integrated in the AI character, enabling virtual agents to sense the variables in the building environments and make decisions. To illustrate the details of ABMs, the submodels include LR models for vertical strategy and statistic distribution model for horizontal wayfinding movement. And the inputs of the ABM (including the probability of choosing elevators/stairs or changing movement directions at key points) originate from a combination of the previous two experiments. The virtual case for agent-based modeling uses the same office building as the horizontal IVE experiment mentioned above. In this virtual case, all avatars start from the entrance of the building on the first floor. Each avatar is randomly labeled as a specific type of occupant, according to the proportions of the clustering labels in the horizontal IVE experiments. Moreover, each avatar will be assigned a target room, so the avatar's task is to move to the target room through vertical (stairs or elevators) and horizontal movement processes. During the simulation, the avatar starts with the horizontal movement on the first floor. Then, the duration of stay in each zone is randomly generated, based on the distribution function in \u201cBehavior Tree\". If the target room is on a different floor of the building, the avatar will eventually arrive at Zone 2 (the zone in front of the elevator and stairs), where it will make decisions regarding vertical movement. The results of the vertical IVE experiments were applied to determine the choice of elevators or stairs, based on the target floor, crowdedness, elevator status, etc., and the avatar acts accordingly. After the avatar reaches the target floor, it will conduct a similar horizontal movement until reaching the target room. The overall logical diagram of the behavior-tree module behind the avatar is shown in Fig. 6 . In this virtual case, 20 virtual avatars enter the building simultaneously, and the AIs move automatically in the buildings. We can observe the occupants\u2019 movement in the buildings, and the number of occupants on each floor and in each zone on the floor are counted and summarized. To validate the ABMs, the simulated number of occupants on the first floor is used to verify with the measured occupant movement data from IVE experiment. The curves of number of occupants in each zone and totally in the first floor are compared between the simulated occupant movements by ABMs and the observed occupant movements in IVE experiments. Two types of evaluation metrics are given to evaluate the accuracy of such ABMs, including the mean absolute error (MAE) and the root mean square error (RMSE) of the occupancy profiles, as well as the \u201coccupant-time\u201d (OT), which refers to the accumulated \u201cduration of stay times number of occupants\u201d. The definitions of the metrics are listed below. (3) M A E = ∑ t = 1 n | o c c r e a l , t − o c c s i m u , t | / n (4) R M S E = ∑ t = 1 n ( o c c r e a l , t − o c c p r e d , t ) 2 / n (5) O T = ∑ t = 1 n o c c t ⋅ Δ t In which occt is the number of occupants at the time step t, Δt is the time step in seconds. Subscripts real and simu refer to the measured and simulated number of occupants. 3 Results 3.1 Results of occupants\u2019 horizontal movement experiment Based on the methodology mentioned in Section 3, we obtained the heatmap outputs of the participants\u2019 eye tracks, which directly reflect their wayfinding strategies. According to these heatmaps, we notice that there are significant differences in the horizontal wayfinding strategies of different participants. To explain the results more intuitively, the wayfinding routes of Participants No. 14 and No. 19 are displayed in Fig. 7 . Obviously, Participant No. 14 goes directly upstairs as soon as he notices the directory board. In contrast, Participant No. 19 wanders continually in the lobby on the first floor for a long time, even after noticing the directory. From the heatmap, the reason why Participant No. 19 did not go upstairs after seeing the directory is probably because he regards the directory as useless information, resulting in a longtime wayfinding pattern. After the participants reached the target floor, the different levels of attention paid to the signage were also demonstrated through the heatmaps of the participants\u2019 eye tracks. Fig. 8 shows the eye tracks and routes of Participants No. 14 and No. 19. Participant No. 14 paid full attention to the target sign and quickly reached the target room. In contrast, Participant No. 19 simply scanned the signs and spent much more time observing the surrounding environment, resulting in a longer time to find the target place. Therefore, by comparing the eye-track heatmaps and the occupants\u2019 wayfinding time, it can be inferred that different levels of attention to the signage might be one of the leading factors for different wayfinding patterns. The duration of stay in the public areas also differed significantly. After pruning the data missing issues and incomplete experiments, there were 80 effective samples of route recordings and eye tracks. The longest duration of stay in the public areas was more than 6 minutes, while the shortest one was only 31 seconds. Fig. 9 shows the distribution of time spent in public areas. From Fig. 9, three quarters of the participants spent between 1 min and 3 min staying in the public space. Only nine participants spent more than three minutes. Obviously, the holistic data presents a right-skewed distribution, which implies that most participants have a good awareness of the signage in the building. Based on the methodology of horizontal movement pattern analysis described in Section 3, the first floor of the case building was divided into six zones, and each occupant route was converted into a six-dimensional array representing their duration of stay in each zone. Then, through the K-means algorithm and evaluation by the CH index, five typical patterns of occupants\u2019 horizontal movement behavior were acquired, as demonstrated in Fig. 10 . The Type 1 occupants mainly stayed in zones 1, 2, and 6. This type identifies the destination in the directory area (Zone 1) and quickly moves to wait for the elevator (Zones 2 and 6). The Type 2 occupants moved to all zones except Zone 5, which suggests that this occupant type searches the entire floor before reaching the final destination. The Type 3 occupants also stayed in zones 1, 2, and 6, similar to Type 1. However, the Type 3 occupants stayed much longer in each zone than the Type 1 occupants. The Type 4 occupants also searched all the zones, but stayed much longer in the transition hall (Zone 6) searching for the destination. The Type 5 occupants stayed in Zones 1, 2, and 6 and also searched the north classroom (Zone 3) before finding the final destination. The five types suggest five different wayfinding patterns within the same floor. Based on the clustering results, the distribution of the duration of stay was further analyzed. Taking Type 1 as an example, we further calculated the distributions of the occupants\u2019 durations of stay in six different zones. The distributions of the duration of stay for Type 1 are shown in Fig. 11 . 3.2 Results of occupants\u2019 vertical movement strategy experiment After the vertical movement experiments, the results of the 83 participants\u2019 vertical strategies for taking elevators or stairs in different situations were obtained. Table 4 shows the probability of taking an elevator in each scenario. According to the probability results, we can infer some rules about the occupants\u2019 vertical movement strategies. The probability of the participants taking an elevator was quite low in both Scenarios 2 and 6. These two scenarios were both designed with a lower target floor, many other occupants waiting for the elevator, and a strong time limitation, which implies that participants under such scenarios are most inclined to choose stairs, and the elevator status (arriving or leaving) has minor impact on the participants\u2019 choices under these circumstances. In Scenarios 1, 4, and 5, all the participants chose the elevator as the vertical movement method, which means that the participants have an obvious tendency for the elevator when no one else is waiting for it. In Scenarios 11 and 12, the participants showed a slight preference for the elevator when they had a relatively high target floor and no time limitation. Based on the experimental data, the correlations among the situational variables and the results of the participants\u2019 vertical decisions were further investigated. Logistic regression (LR) was applied to construct the relationship between the four variables and the outcomes. The variables and outcomes were split into an 80% training set and 20% testing set. After the training process, the area under ROC curve (AUC) (Hajian-Tilaki, 2013) of the LR model was 68.9%, which demonstrates similar accuracy with other LR models in previous occupant behavior studies with accuracy ranging from 0.493 to 0.777 (Haldi & Robinson, 2009)The trained LR function is shown in Eq. (6). (6) l = log 10 p 1 − p = 0.98 + 0.14 x 1 − 0.57 x 2 + 0.28 x 3 − 0.27 x 4 , where p refers to the final probability of the participants taking the elevator (0 represents choosing the stairs, while 1 represents choosing the elevator), x1 refers to the height of the target floor (unit: m), x2 refers to the time pressure, which is converted into a Boolean type (0 represents no time limit, while 1 represents a five-minute time limit); x3 represents the elevator status, which is calculated as a Boolean type (0 represents the elevator leaving, while 1 represents it arriving), and x4 represents the crowdedness as a continuous variable. From Eq. (6), the crowdedness plays a negative role in the participants\u2019 vertical strategies. The negative value means that more people waiting for the elevator will lead more participants to choose the stairs, rather than choosing an elevator. Similarly, the time pressure also plays a negative role, which means that participants with a strict time limitation will be more likely to choose the stairs. The other two variables, the height of the target floor and the elevator status, have positive effects. The higher the target floor was, the more participants preferred to take the elevator. Moreover, if the elevator arrived soon, the participants would more willingly take it. The reasons for the participants taking the stairs or choosing the elevator are illustrated in Fig. 12 , according to the results of the post-experiment questionnaires. Obviously, the leading factor driving participants to choose the stairs is the number of occupants already waiting for the elevator, coinciding with the experimental results and the LR model. When there is no one waiting for the elevator, the participants\u2019 tendency for the elevator will rise significantly, implying that crowdedness is the most essential visual stimulus among the four driven factors in the IVE experiment. The primary factor driving participants to take the elevator is \u201chigh target floor,\u201d which confirms the rules that participants are inclined to take the elevator when the target floor is relatively high. Some participants explained in the post-experimental interview that there were other reasons for choosing the elevator. One of the reasons is that the occupant's first direct sight is of the elevators. This answer confirms that the locations of the elevator and stairs have certain impacts on the occupants\u2019 vertical movement strategy, which might provide some thoughts for designers when allocating the stairs and elevators in building. Based on the results of post-questionnaires, it can be noticed that the time to wait for the elevator (elevator status) does not play a significant role, which also matches the inference from the experimental results. In summary, during the decision-making process, the participants are mainly impacted by a combination of three situational variables: time pressure, target floor, and crowdedness. These three variables are further selected as the input parameters for the subsequent vertical ABM. 3.3 ABM for occupants\u2019 movement in buildings For stochastic agent-based modeling, the duration of stay in each zone was randomly generated according to the fitted distribution mentioned in Section Fig. 13 , and set in the behavior-tree module of the IVE environment. Moreover, based on the vertical transportation experimental results, three situational variables (target floor, time pressure, and personnel condition) were embedded in the elevator or stair function, and the probability of taking the elevator was set corresponding to each situation. Based on the above procedures, the ABM for reoccurring occupant movement was established, which can reflect the derived occupants\u2019 horizontal and vertical movement patterns. With the finished ABMs, the study finally set a test case to demonstrate the utility of ABMs. We randomly generated 20 agent-based avatars with various destinations in the virtual office building model in order to simulate the number of occupants at different zones and floors. The number of occupants in the different function zones on the first floor (as shown in Fig. 13 (a)) and the number of occupants on different floors (as shown in Fig. 14) were simulated, which demonstrate the occupants\u2019 horizontal and vertical movements, respectively. Based on ABM, ten simulations are run randomly and acquired the ranges of occupant numbers at different zones. The average results are depicted using solid lines and the ranges reflecting 95% confidence intervals are shown in Fig. 13(a). Twenty samples from IVE-based experiments are further selected based on stratified sampling method as validation data. Based on the clustering results above, the experimental samples are categorized into five clusters. Random samples are then selected according to the different proportions of the clusters, thus extracting 20 samples in total. The numbers of these 20 participants can be obtained from the experimental data, displayed as Fig. 13 (b). It can be noticed that the established ABM could well reflect the rules of occupant movement in different zones. Then, the average predicted number of occupants based on ten simulations of ABMs are calculated and Table 5 lists the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of the predicted number of occupants from multiple runs. MAE could reflect the average absolute error between predicted values and measured values, and meanwhile RMSE represents the error between predicted value and measured value point to point. From Table 5, it can be concluded that the MAE of ABM simulations for different zones on the first floor does not exceed 2, meaning that the average absolute error of the ABM predictions is no more than 2 occupants for each zone.t, Furthermore, RMSE of six zones are less than 2.43, indicating that the average deviation between predicted and true value point to point does not exceed 3 occupants.. Based on the proposed index to evaluate occupants\u2019 duration of stay, comparison of occupant-time is carried out between the simulated data through ABM and the measured data in Fig. 15 . It can be noticed that ABM is capable to reflect the features of occupants\u2019 duration of stay in different zones. In summary, the accuracy of proposed model is sufficiently accurate for simulating the occupants\u2019 indoor movements, with their stochastic patterns and features well reflected in the model. Therefore, with the established ABMs, the number of occupants in each zone or on each floor can be further predicted for those under-design buildings, thus helping to improve the building design strategies to match the movement of occupants better. 4 Discussions 4.1 Potential applications This paper proposes a novel framework of using IVE for occupant behavioral researches. The biggest advantage of the proposed framework is its capability of modeling the occupant's movements in unbuilt architectures, supporting the optimization and decision-making in the design process. Occupant's moving trajectories and eye tracks can be automatically recorded in IVEs, providing sufficient data to study occupant wayfinding behaviors. Thus, one of the first applications for the proposed IVE platform is to visualize the building designs and simulate the occupant's wayfinding behavior under different building layouts and signage, improving the overall design quality. This application mainly focuses on specific unbuilt environments. From another perspective, the established ABMs can help designers to observe and anticipate occupant behavior under extreme circumstances, such as a sudden influx of occupants into the buildings. For instance, in the office building, rush hour is an important and unavoidable issue. With the assistance of ABMs, designers are able to simulate the spatial distributions of occupants under extreme circumstances and evaluate the pressure of vertical and horizontal movement, making emergency plans ahead of time. This application faces to both unbuilt buildings and existing environments, and may help improve the efficiency and robustness of the building transports and systems. Moreover, the IVE platform enables the collection of occupant's wayfinding preferences and selections, forming a large dataset of occupant's wayfinding. This enables further improvements on the design principles to adapt to occupant's current moving patterns to a large extent. IVE-based occupant behavior models make it possible to evaluate building-occupant interactions for non-existing environments at a low cost. 4.2 Limitations of IVE-based occupant behavior models Despite the advantages of simulating unbuilt environments with IVE-based occupant behavior models, the limitations of the models should also be carefully considered. The validity of IVE-based experiments and modeling is a common issue because of the gap between the visual stimuli in the virtual environment and the occupant's real-life experience. In this study, the physics parameters such as the materials of building, walking speed of avatars and operating speed of elevators are validated with real-life observations and experiments, ensuring the validity of the configurations of the IVE. The validity of other aspects in IVE is not validated and could be improved in future efforts. Moreover, the immersion of participants in IVE has not been tested with questionnaires or other tests, which should be further considered. The responses and answers of the participants in the experiments and questionnaires should be further validated to improve the effectiveness of the study. Due to the limited building type and designed scenarios, other factors impacting occupants\u2019 vertical movement such as health problem, the distance of stairs and elevators, etc. have not been considered in the current IVE experiments, which are required to be explored in further studies. The generalization is another issue. This study proposed a generalized framework of statistical analysis and agent-based modeling based on IVE experiments. The essential elements within this framework, including key factors of vertical movements, function forms of logistic regressions, clustering analysis of horizontal moving patterns and the logic diagram of ABMs can be universally transferred and applied across different cases. However, the detailed parameters within this framework can be case-specific, which requires additional efforts to build 3D models and conduct IVE experiments when applying to different cases. The key of the proposed study is the approach to utilize IVE experimental environment and ABM simulation platform to observe, investigate, analyze and represent the diversity of occupant's movement in buildings. From this perspective, the capability of capturing the diversity of the features can be generalized. In addition, only 83 participants joined the IVE experiments, most of which are college students. This could be applicable to the case building of this research, which is a teaching and office building in university campus. However, different participant groups with various ages, careers and social backgrounds should be considered for cases with different building types and functions. The selection of participant groups should be in accordance with the target building design. Also, a large database with wayfinding patterns of various occupant groups and building types could also be gathered and established for practical further applications in building design phase. Moreover, the number of participants in this study is not abundant for practical design applications, which could be further improved in future studies. 5 Conclusions Occupant movement is a significant factor that influences building energy consumption. To understand the potential patterns and motivations of occupants\u2019 horizontal and vertical movements, this study proposed an IVE-based experimental platform to observe, investigate, and simulate occupants\u2019 movement in buildings. ABMs were established to reconstruct the observed results and to simulate the number of occupants in buildings. This study proposed a novel systematic approach to observe, analyze, and simulate an occupant's horizontal and vertical movements in buildings under design. In this study, two IVE-based experiments were separately conducted to obtain the occupant movement patterns in the horizontal and vertical directions. In the vertical movement experiment, the participants chose the elevator or stairs under various scenarios. In the horizontal movement experiment, the participants were required to find ways to target rooms, with their routes and eye tracks recorded chronologically. The experimental results were analyzed, and the key behavioral features were extracted to establish corresponding agent-based models. Occupant movement between different floors and different areas within the same floor can be modeled with the proposed ABMs. Admittedly, the present study has several limitations that should be considered and addressed in future research. Future research should pay more attention to the limitations mentioned above and expand occupant-movement behavior model to fit various types of buildings.

        "dc:description": "Occupant's movement in buildings is one of the most essential factors that influence building energy consumption. Understanding the movement of occupants in buildings is crucial for building design and operations. The advances in virtual reality (VR), especially immersive virtual environments (IVEs), offer new and cost-effective alternatives for occupant behavior studies in unbuilt buildings at design phase and establishing controlled experimental scenarios. This paper presents a general framework for the investigation, analysis, and modelling of the horizontal and vertical movements of occupants in buildings using IVE experimental platform. We first established an IVE experimental platform and conduct the experiment in IVE platform to observe occupant horizontal and vertical movement in buildings. The collected experimental data were then used to statistically analyze and extract key features of the occupant's vertical and horizontal movement patterns, based on which a set of agent-based models (ABMs) are built to simulate stochastic occupant's horizontal and vertical movement patterns in buildings. The proposed method can efficiently capture the occupants\u2019 movement patterns, therefore creating more realistic ABMs for simulation. The proposed method provides an efficient approach to utilizing IVE technology for occupant movement pattern observations and modeling horizontal and vertical moving patterns for advanced building design and management.",
