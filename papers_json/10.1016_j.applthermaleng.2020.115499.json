In the operation of central air conditioning systems, the phenomenon of large flow and small temperature difference is often seen. Due to great differences in user cooling loadings, the terminal temperature difference between the supply and return water is considerable. Thus, the performance of the system is insignificant when using a variable frequency to control the chilled water pump. In order to find a more effective approach, this paper presents a deep analysis of the terminal surface heat exchange performance under wet conditions. By building a simulation model, the effects of the chilled water flow and air flow on the surface heat exchange performance were determined, and an optimal energy-saving control strategy based on a fixed-temperature-difference surface cooler was proposed. This strategy not only maintains the good alignment of the temperature difference between the supply and return chilled water, but also improves system stability and decreases chilled water transfer loss. Based on this strategy, the system prioritises the utilisation of air flow to meet the cooling load disturbance and reduce energy consumption of the fan. The total energy saved is up to 12.5%. The control strategy was validated by experimental results. This strategy is benefit for reducing energy consumption.

The problem of urbanization are more and more serious in urban environment [3-5]. For addressing environmental issues, the energy consumption increased, through related emissions for burning fossils or the extraction of materials [6]. More than 40% of global energy consumption and 30% of global greenhouse emission were produced due to both commercial and residential usage in buildings [7]. The energy consumption of buildings accounts for about 20\u201340% of the total energy use worldwide [8], especially in developed countries, including Denmark [9] and the USA [10]. The energy consumption of air conditioning systems, as one of the most important parts of this category of energy use, accounted for about 40% of energy consumption for all buildings [11]. For example, in China, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems in commercial, industrial, and residential buildings consume 35% of the total energy in these buildings [12,13]. Therefore, performance improvement of air conditioning systems is essential to reduce building energy consumption [14,15]. HVAC engineers have spent much effort in designing new types of air conditioning systems or developing advanced control strategies to reduce energy consumption [15-19] while maintaining acceptable thermal comfort [3] and indoor air quality (IAQ) [20-23]. Because the actual load conditions are always less than the design operating conditions. Different methods have been applied in different types of HVAC systems to improve effectiveness, such as variable air volume (VAV) [14], variable refrigeration flow (VRF) [24,25], and variable water volume (VWV) technology [26]. Most previous investigations have proven they can reduce the energy consumption of the system [27-30]. Thus, they were extensively applied in air-conditioned buildings. In order to improve the energy efficiency of the HVAC system, some investigations have focused on the system-model estimation, including the detailed dynamic model [31], transient thermal model [32], and simulated model [33,34]. Some studies developed optimisation methods [35,36]) and control strategies [37,38] to apply in the system. Zhu et al. [35] analysed the optimal control of a combined air conditioning system with variable refrigerant flow and variable air volume for energy saving. Di Battista and Cipllone [38] present a mathematical model of the A/C system, starting from its single components. The results showed a 22% reduction of compressor shaft power with respects to the air cooled condenser case and significant COP increase. Chuang et al. [39] studied a fan coil unit and chiller by an intelligent control method with a stepless variable speed driving technology. The energy-saving rate approached 35%. Chen et al. [40] developed a thermal-resistance-based method for the optimal design of central variable water/air volume chiller systems, which successfully avoids the limitation of the traditional trial-and-error method and improves the energy efficiency. Zheng and Zaheer-Uddin [41] developed steady-state models of HVAC system components in their effort to study the optimisation of thermal processes in VAV systems. Kusiakand [42] developed a daily steam load model for the HVAC system. They used five data-mining algorithms to construct the model. In another study by Karunakaran et al. [42], they employed a fuzzy logic controller (FLC) in a VAV system and VRF system to optimally control the temperature and air quality in which the FLC generated the compressor speed, fan speed, and damper opening. Zhao et al. [43] and Chu et al. [44] also carried out similar investigations with a fuzzy control method. However, most of the above investigations only focused on the performance of the system without considering the stability. Few investigations considered the control strategy effects on both the performance and stability of HVAC systems. The surface heat exchanger is the primary device of the terminal unit of an air conditioning system. As the terminals use chilled water as refrigerant, it has been applied mostly for public buildings [45]. Variation in the performance of the surface heat exchanger affects the whole performance of the HVAC system. Thus, it is necessary to analyse the characteristic of heat-transfer performance of the surface heat exchanger in the HVAC system. In the other hand, while designing an air conditioning system, the maximum terminal cooling load was calculated, and some compensatory margins were supplemented for reliability considerations. Thus, the size of the apparatus of the system always is much greater than that of the actual demand. However, in actual operation, in 90% of the running time, the central air conditioning system worked at under 65% of the design cooling load condition [46]. For the constant flow hydraulic system, the terminal always ran under a large flow rate and small temperature difference condition, which would cause low heat-transfer efficiency of the surface heat exchanger and high energy consumption, especially in fan-coil systems [47]. For a VWV system, under a partial cooling load, if the supply-air flow rate was kept constant, in order to keep the room temperature constant, the chilled-water flow rate was reduced. However, the outlet temperature of the chilled water would increase and exceed the design range of the supply and return chilled water temperature difference. If a variable frequency were used for chilled water pumps, regardless of the constant-temperature-difference or constant-pressure-difference control, the system would rely on the concentration effect of the main pipe, which is quite different from the actual status of terminals, yielding a limited performance. According to previous investigations [35,37]), the heat-transfer characteristic of the surface heat exchange is quite nonlinear under the heat process. If the chilled water flow was set at 40% of the designed value, the heat-transfer capacity would already reach approximately 70% of the rated heat-transfer capacity. The strategy using the large flow rate and small temperature difference could not increase the heat-transfer performance of the surface heat exchanger. Therefore, it is not ideal to merely rely on the regulation of the chilled water flow in the surface heat exchanger. Based on the above analysis, in order to improve the performance of the central air conditioning system, this study built a mathematical model of the surface heat exchanger, terminals of the system, and object [48]. Through simulation, the investigation of the performance of surface heat exchanger against the variations in chilled water flow rate, supply-air flow rate, and cooling load disturbance was conducted. Developing from this, this paper proposes a method based on a constant chilled water temperature difference between the inlet and outlet in the terminal unit to enable good alignment of the chilled temperature difference in the central air conditioning system. The strategy properly solves the mismatch problem of chilled water and improves the system stability and performance. Under partial cooling load conditions, on the condition of satisfying the constant temperature difference of the terminal unit, the air flow of unit is taken as the priority means to meet the load disturbance to keep the surface heat exchanger working with high efficiency and decrease the energy consumption of the air-side system. Therefore, this paper proposes a new surface heat exchanger control strategy that not only improves the stability of the central air conditioning system and further reduces energy consumption, but also enlightens future applications. 2 Methods 2.1 Simulation model 2.1.1 Mathematical model of surface cooler under wet conditions The heat performance of the terminal unit was determined by the performance of the surface heat exchanger. Thus, this study takes into account the heat-transfer characteristics under wet conditions with respect to the equation of the surface heat exchanger physical processes and classical heat exchange. A model of the surface cooler heat exchange is then established with decent universality, by using as few empirical equations as possible. Before the mathematical model was established, the following assumptions were made: 1) The heat capacity of the metallic surface of the surface heat exchanger was neglected; 2) The physical parameters of surface heat exchanger were constant without any effect from the temperature; 3) The Lewis number did not vary after the process of heat transfer and mass transfer, reaching the balance during air treatment. The main models include physical model of heat transfer of heat exchanger, physical model of moisture absorption coefficient. According to the law of energy conservation, the energy equation of the air side and chilled water side of surface heat exchanger could be written as follows. Heat exchange differential equation of air side: (1) ξ m a c a t ai - t ao - Q = c a . p M a ̇ d ( t a . z ) d τ The mean air temperature in surface cooler ( t a . z ) can be calculated by Eq. (2), as shown. (2) t a . z = t a . o + t a . i 2 Heat exchange differential equation of chilled water side: (3) Q - m w c w t wo - t wi = c w M w ̇ d ( t wz ) d τ The mean temperature of cooling water in surface cooler ( t w . z ) can be calculated by Eq. (4), as shown. (4) t w . z = t w . o + t w . i 2 It is well known that the difference in temperature is the driving force for heat exchange. The difference in partial pressure of vapour is the driving force for moisture (mass) exchange. The mass exchange mechanism is similar heat exchange mechanism. When air and water are in contact on an area of one dF m2, the air temperature change is dt and the humidity change is dd , then the sensible heat exchange capacity is calculated as: (5) d Q x = m a c a . p d t = α t - t b d F Moisture exchange capacity is calculated as follows: (6) dW = m a d d = β P q - P qb d F Because the difference of partial pressure of vapour in a relatively small temperature range can be replaced by the difference of humidity ratio with different humidity exchange coefficients, the moisture exchange capacity can also be calculated by Eq. (7). (7) dW = σ d - d b d F Thus, the stored latent heat exchange capacity can calculated by Eq. (8). (8) d Q q = r d W = r σ d - d b d F Total heat exchange capacity is shown, as fellow. (9) d Q z = d Q x + d Q q = α t - t b + r σ d - d b d F Generally, the ratio of total heat exchange capacity to sensible heat exchange capacity is called heat exchange expansion coefficient ξ , also known as moisture absorption coefficient: ξ = d Q z d Q x (10) In the air conditioning unit, the process of air treatment is often accompanied by evaporation and condensation of moisture. Thus, there is often a simultaneous heat and moisture transfer in air conditioning unit. For adiabatic humidification process, on the dF contact surface, the sensible heat loss of air is exactly equal to the latent heat of the moisture evaporation. Thus: (11) α r σ t - t b = d - d b For the G kg/s air, the following heat balance equations can be applied: (12) G c a . p t - t b = G r ( d - d b ) Based on Eqs. (11) and (12), the following equations can be obtained: (13) α σ = c a . p This is the Lewis Relation [48], which shows that the ratio of convective heat transfer coefficient to convective mass transfer coefficient is constant. The study results show that the Lewis relation can be applied to the process of heat and moisture exchange between air and water. Thus, Eq. (9) can be changed to: (13) d Q z = σ c a . p t - t b + r d - d b d F Eq. (13) is an approximate formula due to without considering the fluid heat transfer of moisture evaporates or condenses. Thus, using enthalpy of moisture to replace the latent heat of vaporization in the equation. Meanwhile, the specific heat capacity value of wet air was equal 1.01 + 1.84d. Eq. (13) can be changed to: (14) d Q z = σ { 1.01 t + 2500 + 1.84 t d ] - [ 1.01 t b + 2500 + 1.84 t b d b ] } d F Thus, Eq. (14) is as fellows (15) d Q z = σ i - i b d F Eq. (16) is also called Merkel Equation, which shows that when heat and mass transfer is simultaneously under progress, if the Lewis relation is satisfied, the driving force of total heat exchange is the enthalpy difference of air. Therefore, the total heat exchange is related to the enthalpy difference of the wet air, or the wet bulb temperature difference between the main body air and the boundary layer air. According to Lewis Relation, Eq. (5) can be changed to: (16) d Q x = α t - t b d F = σ c a . p t - t b d F The dimensionless moisture absorption coefficient can be calculated by Eq. (17). (17) ξ = d Q z d Q x = σ i - i b d F σ c a . p t - t b d F = i - i b c a . p t - t b In this equation, t b is the temperature of boundary layer air which is the temperature of the saturated air close to the water film. The enthalpy of the inlet air of the surface heat exchanger ( i ) which can be calculated from the dry bulb temperature ( t a . z ) and the moisture content (d) of the inlet air of the surface cooler. The empirical formula is [48 49]: (18) i = 1.01 t a . z + 2500 + 1.84 t a . z d (19) d = 0.622 P q P - P q = 0.622 0.01 ∗ ϕ ∗ P v 101326 - 0.01 ∗ ϕ ∗ P v (20) P v = 611.2 ∗ e x p [ 18.678 - t a . z 234.5 ∗ t a . z t a . z + 257.14 ) ] When the water film temperature ranges from 10 °C to 20 °C, the enthalpy value of water film temperature can be calculated by the following empirical formula: (21) i b = 0.0707 t b 2 + 0.6452 t b + 16.18 The total heat transfer between air and chilled water was calculated as (22) Q = F q In Eq. (22), the density of heat flow rate ( q ) could be calculated by the logarithmic mean temperature difference method, as follows. (23) q = k Δ t m = k t ai - t wo - ( t ao - t wi ) ln t ai - t wo t ao - t wi When t ai - t wo t ao - t wi was less than 2, the logarithmic mean temperature could be calculated by the simplified Eq. (24), with an error lower than 4%. (24) Δ t m = t ai - t wo - ( t ao - t wi ) 2 Under the cooling and dehumidification process, when detail information of the heat exchanger structure had been determined, the heat-transfer rate could be calculated by an empirical equation, as follows. (25) k = 1 1 A v y a ξ b + 1 B ω c In Eq. (25), A , a , b , B, c were the coefficients and indexes obtained from experiments. In summary, the heat transfer between air and chilled water can be calculated by Eq. (26). (26) Q = F q = F ∗ 1 1 A v y a ξ b + 1 B ω c ∗ t ai - t wo - ( t ao - t wi ) ln t ai - t wo t ao - t wi 2.1.2 Establishment of simulation model According to the mathematical model of the dynamic surface heat exchanger of the terminal unit using the modular function of Matlab and Simulink toolbox, the partial mathematical models are modularised into sub-blocks, which are expanded to make secondary blocks. Then, a simulation model of surface heat exchanger is built under the wet condition, as shown in Fig. 1 . From Fig. 1, it can be seen that this model consists of four sub-blocks, including blocks for the surface cooler dehumidifying coefficient, unit-area heat exchange, surface heat exchanger with chilled water side, and surface heat exchanger air side under wet conditions [46]. The secondary sub-blocks included five input variable parameters and two variable parameters. The input variable parameters included the air flow rate, air relative humidity, inlet air temperature, inlet chilled water temperature, and chilled water flow rate. The output variable parameters included outlet air temperature and outlet chilled water temperature. All analyses of the performance of the surface heat exchanger of the terminal unit in an HVAC system were based on this model. In this study, a typical 4-row surface heat exchanger was investigated. The total area of the surface heat exchanger (S) was 48.6 m2. The frontal area (Fy ) was 0.944 m2, water storage capacity was 3 kg, and air storage capacity is 0.5 kg. Other specific parameters are shown in Table 1 [48]. 2.1.3 Conditions of the simulation In order to analyse the performance of the terminal unit, the validation of a typical 4-row surface heat exchanger model is necessary. Therefore, the rated condition, as a simulation condition, was compared. Detailed information on the rated condition is shown in Table 2 . Thus, in the simulation condition, the inlet air temperature was 27 °C. The relative humidity was set to 60%. The inlet chilled water temperature was 7 °C, and the outlet chilled water temperature was 12 °C. Other parameters were set following Table 2. Based on this validation model, in order to determine the relationships between the heat-transfer capacity of the surface heat exchanger and the chilled water flow rate and supply-air flow rate, some specific simulation conditions were analysed. The specific simulation conditions were as follows. The inlet air input temperature was 27 °C. The relative humidity was 60%. The input chilled water temperature was 7 °C. The maximum value of air flow was 1.8 kg/s. The maximum chilled water flow rate was 1.4 kg/s. The simulation step size was 900 s. 2.2 Experiments 2.2.1 Experimental system For validating the control strategy, the control valve was used to assess HVAC system, which was separately carried out under variable water volume control mode and variable air volume control mode in enthalpy difference laboratory, shown in Fig. 2 . The experimental system included a control and test systems. The control system consisted of two subsystems: chilled water system and air flow system. In the chilled water system, chilled water was created and controlled by the chiller unit (7). And then, the chilled water was supplied by the Varable frequency pump (6), past the Stream heating box (9) and Mixing box (8) to reached the Fan coil (4). In the Fan coil, the chilled water aborbed the heat from the air flow. The water temperature rose. Leaving the Fan coil, the chilled water was returned to the Chiller unit (7). One water cycle finished. In air flow system, the air tempertaure of the room was controled by the Air handing unit (5). When the experiments started, the air flow was controled by the Air handing unit (5). And then the air flow were flowed into the Fan coild to heat transfer with chilled water by Fan. The air flow was cooled by chilled water. After cooling, the air flow was handed in the Air handing unit. One cycle air flow in Fan coil finished. In the test system, the supply and return water temperature were measured from the measuring points by temperature sensor which were set at the chilled water inlet and outlet of the tested fan coil. The chilled water flow volume was control by the valve. The air side was connected with the enthalpy difference laboratory device. The air coming out from the fan coil had to pass through air supply sampling and temperature sensor. The air supply sampling and temperature sensor were used to measure the supply air state parameters. After passing through the induced drag fan, the cold air entered the static pressure chamber. The return air sampling device was set at the return air inlet to measure the return air state parameters. The Air hand unit and Fan were used to maintain the indoor environment to meet the laboratory requirements. In addition, the fan frequency and power were also recorded. All the data were collected by data collector. The experiment system monitoring platform was shown in Fig. 3 . It indicated that the laboratory equipment could provide and maintain the required indoor environmental conditions, and the chilled water flow amount, chilled water temperature, air rate and indoor environmental parameters could be set as needed. 2.2.2 Experiment scheme and process The objective of the experiment was to validate the control strategy of the HAVC system. The experimental procedure was as follows: 1) Keep the indoor air in standard condition. Running the chiller and chilled water pump. The chilled water temperature was set at 7 °C. And then, flow rate of chilled water was maintained 1.5 m3/h constantly. 2) Run the air hand unit for creating the indoor air temperature near 35 °C. And then, the fan coil was opened. 3) In the control system, the indoor air temperature was set at 24 °C. The difference temperature between supply and return chill water was maintained 5 °C. The automatic control mode was adopted in this system. 4) In the end, the converter was stared to run. The air temperature and the temperature difference between supply and return chilled water was record every 10 s until both of them reached the set points at the same time. The series of experiments included four kinds of conditions. The indoor air temperature was set in four levels. They were 24 °C, 25 °C, 26 °C, and 27 °C. Other parameters were the same in the experiments. To evaluate the energy balance in this experimental system, the air-side heat transfer of the fan coil was calculated by Eq. (27). The water-side heat transfer was calculated by Eq. (28). Keeping the energy balance in this experimental system is imperative. Eq. (29) defines the difference between the two energy balances calculated. In this investigation, the differences in energy remains ± 5% for all tests when approaching steady conditions. (27) Q a = m a ( i ai - i ao (28) Q w = c m w ( t wi - t wo (29) Δ Q = 2 Q a - Q w Q a + Q w 3 Results 3.1 Model validation Fig. 4 shows the variations in the outlet chilled water temperature, air temperature, and capacity of heat transfer with respect to simulation time. The temperature of the chilled water increased quickly and remained stable after 20 s near 11.9 °C. However, the output air temperature of the surface heat exchanger varied dramatically, soaring initially and remaining constant after 20 s as well around 16.3 °C. The variation in heat-transfer capacity with time is also shown in Fig. 4. The heat-transfer capacity stabilised after a short of adjustment period to around 33700 W. Compared to the rated working condition, it could be noted that the maximum error is 5.9% and the average error is 3.4%. As a result, this model was validated and used for further investigation. 3.2 Variation in the relative heat-transfer capacity Fig. 5 shows the variations in the relative heat-transfer capacity with respect to the relative flow rates of the chilled water and supply air. As can be seen from the plot, the heat-transfer capacity of the surface heat exchanger has a significant variation zone with respect to the chilled water flow rate and supply-air flow rate. Initially, the heat-transfer capacity increased dramatically with both flow rates. However, the increase slowed significantly after the relative heat-transfer capacity exceeded 85%. Thus, the surface heat exchanger should be set in the sensitive range. Comparing both of curves of the above plot, when the relative flow rate was concentrated in the range of 65% to 100%, the effect of the supply-air flow rate on heat-transfer capacity was more significant than that of the chilled water flow rate. However, at a relative flow rate in the range of 0 to 65%, both curves were almost parallel, which indicates that their influences on the heat-transfer capacity were similar. Therefore, to satisfy the variation in cooling load, preferential variation in the air flow rate of the surface heat exchanger is an effective method to adapt the cooling load change. 3.3 Variation in chilled water Fig. 6 reveals the variations in the outlet chilled water temperature with respect to the relative flow rate of chilled water and supply air. From Fig. 6, it can be seen that when the supply-air flow rate was constant, as relative the chilled water flow rate increased, the output temperature of the chilled water decreases, shown in black line. When the chilled water flow rate was constant, the output temperature of the chilled water increases with increasing relative air flow rate, shown in red line. When the flow rate of chilled water reached rated flow rate, the outlet temperature of chilled water was 12 °C (rated temperature). Thus, when the relative flow rate of chilled water reached 100%, the final outlet temperature of chilled water was 12 °C. When the chilled water flow rate kept constant, the flow rate of supply air increased, the outlet temperature of chilled water would also increase. Thus, when the relative flow rate of supply air reached 100%, the final outlet temperature of chilled water was 12 °C. In this model, the rated outlet chilled water temperature was 12 °C, shown in Table 2. Therefore, final temperature was the same. When the relative flow rate varied between 10% and 100%, the variation range ability of the output chilled water temperature with relative water flow was around 8.5 °C, and the variation range ability of the relative supply-air flow was around 4 °C. Therefore, the effect of air flow rate on the chilled water temperature was less significant than that of the chilled water flow rate. Especially in small flow rate zone, a slight change in the chilled water flow rate can create a notable variation in the outlet chilled water temperature. However, it remained stable with variation in the air flow rate. That is, the effect of the variation in the air flow rate on the chilled water output temperature was lesser influence than that of the chilled water flow rate. Therefore, the method considering the supply and return chilled water temperature difference as priority in system control was effective. 4 Control optimisation Based on the degree of influence of the chilled water flow rate and supply-air flow rate on the heat-transfer capacity of the terminal unit, the air- and water-linkage control strategy could optimise the heat-transfer performance to keep the temperature difference between the input and output chilled water within a certain range of the design zone near 7 °C, which could provide good indoor thermal comfort and reduce energy consumption. 4.1 Optimise control method In buildings, the central air conditioning system mainly ran during 50\u201380% of designed cooling load conditions. According to the simulation results, under the rated supply-air flow rate condition, when the chilled water flow rate reached 40% of the designed value, the heat-transfer capacity of the terminal unit reached 70% of its rated value. While maintaining the increasing chilled-water flow rate, the effects on the heat-transfer capacity were not significant. Thus, the heat-transfer efficiency of the surface heat exchanger was lower in this condition. If the supply-air flow is simultaneously decreased, the heat exchange performance was even lower. In the high-flow-rate zone, compared with the effects of the chilled water flow rate, supply-air flow rate had more significant influence on heat transfer. Therefore, linkage control of both the chilled-water and supply-air flow rate should be operated. The detailed control principles are shown in Fig. 7 . First, according to the variation in the cooling load, the chilled-water flow rate was preferentially controlled to ensure the temperature difference between the supply and return chilled water was constant and met the design value. Next, the air flow was tuned to effectively control the heat exchange and ran in the high-efficiency zone, which kept the room within the thermal comfort condition and reduced energy consumption of the air fan. The detailed control logic is shown in Fig. 8 . During the control process, if the indoor air temperature meets the target value but the chilled-water temperature difference did not reach the target value, the degree of water valve opening would be adjusted according the temperature difference of the supply and return chilled water until the chilled-water temperature difference becomes constant. At this moment, the terminal unit was working in the high-efficiency zone to avoid the instability issue brought about by an insufficient flow rate of chilled water. If the temperature difference between the supply and return chilled water had met the target value, room temperature would still be out of the control range and the supply-air flow would be given according to the temperature difference between the measured room temperature and set target. Based on the simulation results, the supply-air flow had a significant impact on heat transfer, but only a slight impact on the chilled-water temperature difference of the terminal unit. The supply air could be used to tune the indoor air temperature to the target quickly with little effect on the chilled-water temperature. Then, the energy consumption of the fan would decrease with the decrease in the air flow rate. When adjustment of air flow rate could not meet the variation in the cooling load, the chilled-water flow rate would be varied until a new system balance was achieved. With this strategy, it is easy to maintain a constant chilled-water temperature in a central air conditioning system with high stability and adjustment capability. Control of the air flow rate, as an effective method, could reduce the operating energy consumption of the air-side system. Fig. 9 shows the direct digital control (DDC) principle diagram of terminal unit optimisation. During the control process, compared with the normal surveillance principle, one more supply-water temperature testing point was supplemented. In the terminal unit of system, a floating-point valve is often installed to achieve flow rate control. Air flow was controlled by the DC variable frequency, which not only reduced the energy use, but also decreased noise while maintaining high thermal comfort. A DC variable-frequency fan is a practical option in terms of cost and technique. 4.2 Optimise control simulation To verify the performance of the optimisation control strategy, using simulation model as a basis and adding a water valve, fan, and indoor simulation model blocks, a simulation model was built of a central air conditioning terminal system. The performance of the different control strategies, including traditional adjustment of chilled-water flow rate, and air- and water-linkage control strategy, were compared and analysed in this investigation. The simulation conditions used for optimisation were as follows. The air pressure was 101325 Pa. The initial state of the indoor air temperature was 30 °C. The relative humidity was 60%. The rated air flow rate was 1.8 kg/s (5000 m3/h). The chilled-water flow rate was 1.53 kg/s. The supply temperature of the chilled water was 7 °C. The return temperature of the chilled water was 13 °C. The cooling load of the air conditioning room was 18000 W, near 60% of the rated cooling load. The rated cooling load was 30000 W. The target indoor air temperature was 26 °C. The simulation time was set to 20000 s. During simulation, the air flow was kept constant in the traditional control strategy. However, in the constant-temperature-difference control strategy, the air flow rate was adjusted by the air- and water-linkage control strategy. 4.3 Results of simulation and discussion 4.3.1 Variation in indoor air temperature against the rate of cooling load Fig. 10 shows the variation in indoor air temperature with respect to time under 60%, 80%, and 100% of the rated cooling load. From Fig. 10, with two different kinds of control strategies, the indoor air temperature was determined according to the variation in the cooling load. When the terminal unit ran under the rated cooling load, the fluctuations in both control strategies were very similar. However, when the cooling load varied from 60% to 80%, the air- and water-linkage control strategy had a shorter response time than that of traditional chilled-water flow-rate strategy, especially in the 60% cooling load condition, where the stable time of the constant temperature difference control strategy was approximately 8000 s less than that of the traditional control chilled-water flow-rate strategy near 12000 s. In short, the air- and water-linkage control strategy has advantages over the traditional strategy. Fig. 11 shows the indoor air temperature response to the variation in cooling load under the two control strategies. From Fig. 11, when the cooling load decreased from 80% to 70%, both of the control strategies could reach the set point temperature. However, the stable time of the air- and water-linkage control strategy was obviously shorter than that of the constant-temperature-difference control strategy. 4.3.2 Outlet chilled-water temperature by air- and water-linkage control strategy Fig. 12 shows the variation in the chilled-water temperature under the air- and water-linkage control strategy. It can be seen that, after a short adjustment time, the output chilled-water temperature maintained the target 13 °C to meet the design demand, which indicated the better dynamic range of the air- and water-linkage strategy compared with that of the traditional control strategy. 4.3.3 Rate of energy efficiency The effect of terminal unit adjustment on energy efficiency was seen in two major aspects. On the one hand, the properly controlled chilled-water rate reduced energy consumption of the water-side system. On the other hand, it also reduced the terminal supply-air energy consumption. However, the traditional control model often ignored the energy consumption of the terminal unit caused by the air flow rate. The proposed strategy had higher energy efficiency than the traditional control strategy. According to the law of similarity of fans, when an identical fan (D = D\u2019) transfers an identical flow (ρ = ρ'), the relationship among the power of the fan, flow rate, and speed is as follows: (30) Q Q 0 = n n 0 (31) N N 0 = n n 0 3 Where N and N0 are the working power and design power, respectively. n and n0 are the working speed and design speed, respectively. Q and Q0 are the working air flow rate and design air flow rate, respectively. According to the law of similarity, there was the cube relationship between the power and the air flow rate. Therefore, the effects of the air flow rate on the power of the fan were quite apparent. In a conventional terminal unit, the fan is always operated under the rated condition. Although the fan-coil system has high, medium, and low speed settings, adjustment among these settings requires manual shifting, which is not variable-frequency control. Thus, the energy consumption was higher than that of variable-frequency control. In comparison with the proposed and traditional control strategies, the energy consumption of system was analysed. Fig. 13 shows the variations in the relative air flow rate with the change in cooling load from 100% to 80% and 60%. When the cooling load varied from 100% to 80%, the air flow rate would decrease to nearly 75% of the rated condition. When the variation in the cooling load was from 100% to 60%, the air flow of the terminal unit varied quickly from 100% to 50%, and remained constant at 50%. According to the law of similarity, the energy consumption of the fan was only 12.5% of the rated energy consumption, which means the efficiency was quite significant. Even considering the effect of the conventional 3 levels (high, medium, low) levels of the fan system speed control, the working energy consumption was quite different from the prediction based on the law of similarity. Manual speed control, which is not real-time control, could not reduce the energy consumption and affect human thermal comfort. As a result, the proposed control strategy can reduce the terminal energy consumption. According to Ref. [37], 25\u201335% of the energy used by the central air conditioning system was consumed by the terminals. Thus, it is of great importance to vary the air flow rate of the terminal unit to reduce the energy consumption of the central air conditioning system. 5 Validation of model strategy 5.1 Variations of return air temperature Based on the control strategy, in the validating experiments, the return air temperature would keep constant at the set point. Fig. 14 shows that the variations of return air temperature with running time. At the beginning of experiment, all of the return air temperature decreased sharply. And then, the air temperature fluctuated with the running time. When the running time reached 1200 s, all of the return air temperatures kept constant, near the set point. For example, when the indoor air temperature was set at 24 °C, the return air temperature would kept constant near 24 °C. When the set point of indoor air temperature was 27 °C, the return air temperature would kept near 27 °C in the end. Thus, the results indicated that indoor air temperature would kept near the set point under the control strategy. 5.2 Variation of the temperature difference between supply and return chilled water In the validating experiments, when the return air temperature kept constant at a certain set level, the chilled water would kept constant at the end. Fig. 15 shows that the variations of chilled water temperature difference with running time. At the beginning of running, variations of the chilled water temperature differences fluctuated strongly. And then, when the running time reached 1200 s, all of the variations of the chilled water temperature differences kept constant, near 5 °C. Thus, the results indicated that indoor air temperature kept near the set point under the control strategy, the chilled water temperature difference also meet the design, near 5 °C. 5.3 Energy efficiency of fan Based on the experimental data, it was easy seen that when indoor air temperature was set at 24 °C, the frequency of fan was 40.55 Hz. when indoor air temperature was set at 27 °C, the frequency of fan decreased to 20.65 Hz, which indicated that the frequency of fan increased with the rising of set indoor air temperature. It mean that the lower set air temperature would cause higher cooling load. At the same time, the power of the fan would increase. The detail information of the experimental results were summarized in Table 3 From Table 3, when the indoor air temperature was set at 26 °C, the power of fan accounted for 35.6% of power rating. When indoor air temperature was set at 27 °C, the power of fan only accounted for 33.6% of power rating. Therefore, based on the air- and water-linkage control strategy, the energy efficiency of fan was huge. The cooling lord was lower, the effectiveness of the HVAC system was higher. 5.4 Energy efficiency of chiller water In this investigation, the initial value was fully open with water flow rate 1.5 m3/h. During the procedure, the water flow rate was adjusted based on the deviation of temperature difference between inlet and outlet of chilled water and set temperature difference. The results showed that when indoor air temperature was set at 24 °C, the chilled water flow rate decreased to 1.05 m3/h. The energy consumption reduced by 30.0%. When the air temperature was set at 27 °C, the chilled water flow rate decreased to 0.85 m3/h, which leaded the energy consumption deduce by 43.3%. All the detail information was shown in Fig. 16 . From Fig. 16, it was easy to learn that the chilled water and energy consumption would reduce with the rising of set air temperature. Thus, in the partial load condition, for reducing the energy consumption, the indoor air temperature was suggested to set at high level. Based on the constant chiller water temperature difference strategy, through the continue adjusting of proportional valves, the chilled water flow rate would reduce. But the effects of the chilled water flow rate on indoor air temperature could be ignored, which can prove the results of the simulation conditions. When temperature difference of supply chilled water and return chilled water in the terminal equipment of the system raised, the water temperature difference of the whole system would keep consistent. Thus, the problem of large flow and small temperature Differences would solved. And the stability of the whole system would be promoted. 6 Conclusion In order to reduce the energy consumption of the central air conditioning system, the variations in the temperature difference between the supply and return chilled water at the terminals were analysed. A mathematical model of the dynamic and heat-transfer performance of the heat exchange of the terminal unit under wet working conditions was built using Matlab and Simulink simulation tools. The simulation investigations were carried out in this model. Some conclusions were found, as follow. (1) The simulation model of the surface heat exchanger under wet condition was validated with the rated condition results with an average error of 3.4%, which indicated that the model had a correct high capacity. (2) Based on the model, the effects of chilled-water flow and air flow on the heat exchange performance of a terminal unit was analysed. The results showed that there was a significant sensitive region with respect to the chilled-water flow rate and air flow rate. In the lower relative rate zone from 0 to 65%, variations in the heat-transfer capacity of the surface heat exchanger with respect to the chilled-water flow rate and air flow rate were significant. However, in the range of a higher relative rate zone from 65% to 100%, the effects of the air flow rate on heat-transfer capacity were more significant than those of chilled-water flow rate. The effect of the chilled-water flow rate on the output chilled-water temperature was much more significant than that of the air flow rate. Thus, in the operation procedure, the air- and water-linkage strategy should have a priority in central air conditioning system. (3) An air- and water-linkage control strategy was proposed and analysed. The results indicated that the strategy had good stability during system operation. When the system was operated under the 60% rated cooling load, the energy consumption of the fan would decrease by 12.5%. (4) Based on the experiments, the control strategy was validated. When the indoor set temperature ranged between 24 °C and 27 °C, the energy efficiency rates of chiller water and fan can reach near 30%. The control strategy performance was significant. COP is one of the most important index to evaluate the experiment system. In order to calculate the COP, the Powers of some components in this experiment system needs to be recorded. The components included chiller, chilled water pump, fan of coil, and AHU (air handing unit). However, in this experimental investigation, the Powers of chiller and AHU were not recorded. Thus, in the future work, the Powers of chiller and AHU would be recorded and COP of the system would be analyzed in the validation of model strategy. In addition, for a wet coil, moisture balance is very important for model. Therefore, the effects of the variation of the humidity on stored latent heat would be analyzed in the future work.

        "dc:description": "In the operation of central air conditioning systems, the phenomenon of large flow and small temperature difference is often seen. Due to great differences in user cooling loadings, the terminal temperature difference between the supply and return water is considerable. Thus, the performance of the system is insignificant when using a variable frequency to control the chilled water pump. In order to find a more effective approach, this paper presents a deep analysis of the terminal surface heat exchange performance under wet conditions. By building a simulation model, the effects of the chilled water flow and air flow on the surface heat exchange performance were determined, and an optimal energy-saving control strategy based on a fixed-temperature-difference surface cooler was proposed. This strategy not only maintains the good alignment of the temperature difference between the supply and return chilled water, but also improves system stability and decreases chilled water transfer loss. Based on this strategy, the system prioritises the utilisation of air flow to meet the cooling load disturbance and reduce energy consumption of the fan. The total energy saved is up to 12.5%. The control strategy was validated by experimental results. This strategy is benefit for reducing energy consumption.",
