School of Architecture, Southeast University 2 Sipailou Nanjing 210096 China Occupant-centric control of the environment carries outstanding significance in several fields. Especially in the context of epidemics, occupant-centric environmental control can contribute to the prevention and energy saving. From the perspective of anti-infection ventilation, the traditional approach is to make static corrections to the Wells-Riley (W-R) model according to the environmental characteristics to calculate a reasonable ventilation rate. However, frequent changes in the actual scenario (e.g., occupant status) can easily lead to the failure of such static ventilation in achieving its expected effects, thereby resulting in increased ventilation energy consumption and fluctuations in infection risk. In this study, an intelligent anti-infection ventilation strategy is proposed by combining computer vision with occupant-centric control. Results show that the proposed strategy can dynamically maintain the infection risk around a target value (e.g., 1%). Compared with the ventilation strategy based on a static W-R model, the proposed strategy saves 63.07% of ventilation energy consumption (saves 34.20% of energy consumption of HVAC system). A hardware platform is also built and tested to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed strategy. This study contributes new ideas to balance the energy required for ventilation with the infection risk, and provides a reference for occupant-centric dynamic control and building occupants\u2019 health.

For centuries, human beings have been suffering from tuberculosis [1,2], Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) [3], severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [4], influenza [5], measles [6], and other types of airborne infectious diseases, especially today with the massive spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [7]. According to the World Health Organization (https://covid19.who.int/), the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide has reached over 600 million, accounting for nearly 8% of the global population and resulting in more than 6 million deaths (as of August 1, 2022). Airborne infectious diseases are often spread through direct contact, droplet transmission, and aerosol transmission, thereby posing a significant threat and disruption to the public health and safety [8\u201310]. Pharmaceutical interventions, such as vaccines, are an effective means of preventing airborne infectious diseases [11,12]. However, in the case of COVID-19, although the total number of vaccinations has reached more than 12.3 billion (https://covid19.who.int/), the pandemic is still not fully under control due to virus mutation [13] and other factors. Therefore, in epidemic or post-epidemic periods, there should be other ways to further control the outbreak of airborne infections besides pharmaceutical means, for example, environmental control. Mechanical ventilation has received widespread attention as an environmental control method that can effectively reduce infection risk [8,14,15]. Statistics show that most people spend far more time indoors than they do outdoors, and outbreaks are nearly 20 times more likely to occur in indoor environment than outdoors [16,17]. Indoor ventilation can introduce outdoor air into an enclosed space to dilute indoor air pollutants, and to reduce the indoor infection risk. As early as 1978, Riley et al. [18] studied the spread of airborne infectious diseases in schools through a combination of experimental and theoretical approaches and established a relationship between indoor infection risk and ventilation (known as the Wells-Riley (W-R) model). Since then, the W-R model has been validated, modified, and extended to suit a variety of applications. The original W-R model was only applicable to steady-state conditions, later Rudnick et al. [19] extended this model to non-steady-state conditions by introducing the variable of CO2 concentration, which addressed the large errors in predicting indoor infection risk in poorly ventilated places. Meanwhile, Sun et al. [20] investigated the relationship between social distance and indoor infection risk and modified the original W-R model to lay the foundation for highly accurate predictions. In addition to considering the effects of occasion and accuracy, it is more important to make some modifications to the W-R model by incorporating occupant behavior. The act of wearing a mask was considered as an important factor by the researchers. In the face of unexpected outbreaks, the state and government often call on the public to actively wear masks. Wearing a mask in a crowded environment helps to reduce the infection risk by reducing the exhalation and inhalation of pathogens [8]. However, only relying on masks will not remove the accumulating pathogens from indoor spaces. As a result, mask and ventilation are often required indoors at the same time. Dai et al. [21] used a modified W-R model to study the effect of masks on the prevention of indoor infections and amount of outdoor air required, thereby providing ideas for occupant-centric ventilation during an epidemic. They found that the outdoor air volume required per infected occupant ranges from 1200 m3/h to 4000 m3/h, which is much greater than the regular value, but added that this ventilation rate can be reduced by about 75% when occupants wear masks. However, during an epidemic or post-epidemic period, ensuring that all building occupants wearing masks can be difficult. Usually, some occupants may be wearing masks at some time, but others may not. In this context, the static modified W-R model proposed by Dai et al. [21], assuming that all occupants wearing mask, would provide an insufficient ventilation rate and an increased indoor infection risk. Meanwhile, when the original W-R model is used to calculate outdoor airflow rate may overestimate the ventilation rate, thereby leading to a significant increase in ventilation energy consumption [21]. Therefore, it can hardly balance the infection risk and energy consumption based on static W-R models. Considering dynamic mask wearing behaviors, a modified W-R model based on the dynamic mask wearing detection is necessary. In this case, an occupant-centric intelligent ventilation strategy is proposed to achieve a dynamic equilibrium relationship between indoor infection risk and ventilation energy consumption (i.e., consuming the lowest possible ventilation energy under real-time conditions to allow the infection risk to meet the epidemic prevention requirements). However, traditional experimental or numerical simulation methods may be inapplicable in meeting this dynamic goal. With the rapid development of computer vision technology [22,23], an occupant-centric dynamic control of the environment became a new approach [24\u201326]. The fundamental difference between this control idea and the other control methodologies is that the former can adjust environmental parameters by analyzing real-time images and is more concerned about the state of occupants, hence easily meeting their needs. Computer vision technology is increasingly being studied in the areas of occupant movement, micro-expressions, and appearance [27,28]. In recent years, computer vision has also played a crucial role in the dynamic control of indoor and outdoor sound [29], light [30], and thermal environments [31]. Moreover, computer vision is expected to continue to play an active role in the dynamic and precise control of the indoor air environment (e.g., control of air pollutants, such as bacteria and viruses), especially in today\u2019s world that emphasizes the need for an occupant-centric anti-infection environmental control. For example, Wang et al. [32] used cameras to monitor indoor occupant distribution and to control the airflow in each sub-region based on occupant density using the W-R model. They found that this strategy can reduce the infection risk to 2% and achieve an energy saving rate of 11.7%. Despite demonstrating the effectiveness of image recognition technology in intelligent indoor ventilation, Wang et al. [32] or other researchers did not combine mask wearing with intelligent ventilation. In fact, masks, as an important factor influencing infection risk and ventilation requirements [21], should be fully considered in occupant-centric dynamic anti-infection ventilation control. As shown in Fig. 1 , this study integrates computer vision with occupant-centric environmental control to propose an intelligent anti-infection ventilation strategy based on building occupants\u2019 related information. The aim is to dynamically maintain the infection risk near the target value while minimizing the required ventilation energy (e.g., the target value of infection risk is taken as 1%). This strategy mainly detects masks in real scenarios by means of image recognition and ensures the related data in real time by utilizing occupant trajectory recognition algorithms. Given the uncertainty of mask wearing during epidemic or post-epidemic periods, a dynamic modified W-R model that considers the combined effect of masks during multi-occupant scenarios is also developed to calculate real-time ventilation rate for the proposed anti-infection ventilation strategy. To implement the proposed strategy, a low-cost and portable hardware platform is built and tested in multiple scenarios. Overall, the proposed intelligent indoor anti-infection ventilation strategy based on occupant-related information helps balance the relationship between the energy required for ventilation and the infection risk, and provides some references for air health promotion and an occupant-centric dynamic control of the environment. 2 Methodology 2.1 Research overview This work proposed a computer vision-assisted occupant-centric control of the indoor environment, namely, an indoor anti-infection ventilation strategy based on the occupant-related information for energy efficient ventilation in epidemic and post-epidemic periods. This study applied theoretical and experimental approaches to justify the proposed intelligent ventilation strategy. As shown in Fig. 2 , first, the W-R model was modified dynamically to obtain the infection risk assessment equation considering the number of mask wearing and non-wearing indoor occupants. Second, the face detection model, mask classification model, and trajectory recognition model were introduced based on the PyramidBox [24] algorithm and bounding box [32]. Third, the average indoor infection risk and optimum outdoor ventilation rate for each typical situation were theoretically analyzed according to the modified model. Fourth, a case study was conducted to verify the effectiveness of computer vision algorithms in real scenarios and to evaluate the infection risk and energy saving rate. Fifth, a low-cost and portable hardware platform was built and tested in multiple scenarios to provide a reference for the engineering application of the proposed strategy. Control logic is essential to an intelligent control process. Fig. 3 shows the schematic diagram of the proposed indoor intelligent anti-infection ventilation control logic. First, the real-time video stream information of room entrances and exits was obtained by installing cameras inside and outside the room. The frames were extracted from the video stream at a certain frequency and saved as images. The frequency should be sufficient to ensure that all passing occupants were detected (4 times per second for this study). Afterward, the face detection model (Section 2.2.1) was used to obtain the information in the image, including the number of occupants passing by and the location of their faces. If no occupant was detected at the current moment, then the original air change rate was maintained for ventilation. Otherwise, the detected face information was transferred to the mask classification model (Section 2.2.1) to identify whether the occupant at the entrance or exit of the room was wearing a mask or not. A bounding box-based trajectory recognition model (Section 2.2.2) was also used to determine whether the current occupant was entering or leaving the room, and to change the relevant information in the database. The indoor ventilation performance was then optimized based on the information in the real-time database and the dynamically modified W-R model (Section 2.2.3) to obtain satisfactory indoor air quality and energy saving rate. The time interval of the video frame extraction should be adjusted not only according to the size of room entrances and exits but also according to the flow of occupants. When the target is a space with small entrances (exits) and low foot traffic (e.g., offices and conference rooms), the interval time can be increased to save computer resources. On the contrary, when the target is a space with large entrances (exits) and high foot traffic (e.g., hospitals, railway stations, and libraries), the interval time can be reduced to prevent missing occupants. In this work, the target area is an open-planned office with small entrances (exits) and low foot traffic. Therefore, the time interval of the video frame extraction was set to 0.25 s, that is, image recognition was performed every 0.25 s. The system also sends warnings (e.g., automatic beeps, temporary closure of entrances, or email alerts to managers) when the database shows that the density of occupants in the room is too large or the proportion of occupants without masks is too high for the maximum airflow of the system to meet the ventilation needs. The above control principle was also implemented in a practical case. Infection risk and ventilation energy consumption were used as indicators to evaluate the indoor anti-infection ventilation strategy based on occupant-related information. 2.2 Method description 2.2.1 Face detection model and mask classification model The single shot face detector comes in multiple types, with each type having its own advantages. SSD [33] and YOLO [34], as typical anchor-based detectors, demonstrate strong image recognition capability by applying the objective function directly to the provided feature maps. However, the accuracy of these detectors still needs to be optimized in complex situations, such as occluded faces, diverse face sizes, and blurred faces. Cai et al. [35] argued that an effective means to improve prediction accuracy was to expand the sub-network for each task. Therefore, both SSH [36] and DSSD [37] had increased the depth and width of the prediction module in recent years to address the problems encountered by the prediction module in classifying and localizing features. Inspired by Inception-ResNet [38], the PyramidBox algorithm introduced a context-sensitive prediction module (CPM) to obtain broader and deeper network gains. This module mainly used the residual-free prediction module of DSSD to replace the convolution layer of the context module in SSH, hence allowing the CPM to obtain all the benefits of the DSSD module approach while retaining the rich contextual information of the SSH context module. In addition, the PyramidBox algorithm considered Maxout [39,40] to ensure that all faces were detected as much as possible. Fig. 4 shows the network structure of the prediction model based on the PyramidBox algorithm. First, the input image was scaled to a suitable size and fed to the prediction model. Second, all the information in the image was filtered or deep processed by the following layers: scale-equitable backbone layers, low-level feature pyramid layers, pyramid detection layers, predict layers, and PyramidBox loss layers [27]. Third, the prediction model outputted the visualization results by drawing bounding boxes on the original image and recording the face positions. Presented by Tang et al. [27] at the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV) in 2018, the PyramidBox algorithm is widely used in face detection and prediction because of its robustness to common problems, such as background processing, ambient lighting, facial occlusion, expression change, and scale change. Therefore, the face detection model and mask classification model based on PyramidBox algorithm were used in this study for mask detection and information extraction. These models were trained based on the WIDER FACE (https://shuoyang1213.me/WIDERFACE/) and Baidu self-picked face datasets (https://aistudio.baidu.com/aistudio/datasetoverview) and could be widely used to determine whether occupants in various environments were wearing masks or not. Both models used in this study are lightweight models, which are suitable for deployment on mobile or edge detection devices with limited computing power. 2.2.2 Trajectory recognition model An accurate and fast determination of the movement status of occupants at the entrance (exit) is crucial for this study. According to the proposed control principle (Fig. 3), upon recognizing the presence of an occupant at the entrance (exit) of an area, the face detection model needs to determine whether this occupant is entering or leaving the target area. The trajectory recognition model used in this study worked based on the bounding box, which was able to mark the specific area where an occupant was located. After the bounding box was generated by the face detection model, the location of the box center point and the area of the box were obtained. As shown in Fig. 5 , the motion trajectory of occupants at the entrance (exit) of the target area was determined by monitoring the following phenomena: I. Monitor the location of the center point of the box and confirm that the center of the box inside the video boundary is continuously approached from a certain position A(x1 ,y1 ) (x1 < x2 ) and finally crosses the boundary curve (x = x2 ) to reach a certain position B(x3 ,y3 ) that satisfies x3 > x2 . II. Monitor the area of the box and confirm that the area of the box inside the video boundary gradually increases from S1 to a certain area S2 that satisfies S1 < S2 . In the trajectory recognition process, when the bounding box meets the requirements of I and II at the same time, the number of occupants in the target area has changed. For example, for the camera installed outside the target area and facing the exits, when the bounding box in the captured video satisfies both requirements I and II, the number of occupants in the target area is considered reduced (1 bounding box satisfying the requirements corresponds to 1 less occupant). The boundary curve in the trajectory recognition model is set according to the actual demand after the video boundary is determined, and the line can be a straight line or a curve. The trajectory recognition model is used along with the face detection model only to determine the movement status of occupants at the entrance and exit of an area. The mask classification model comes into play to determine whether the entering or leaving occupant is wearing a mask or not. As long as the computer resources are sufficient, the above three models can run simultaneously in real time. 2.2.3 Infection risk model A dynamically modified W-R model was used in this study to ensure that the average infection risk in the target area was below a specific value (e.g., less than 1%). It is important to note that the infection risk in this study refers to the probability of a susceptible occupant being infected. As shown in Eq. (1), the original W-R model [18] determines infection risk by mainly considering indoor ventilation rate, disease type, number of infected occupants, and exposure time. (1) P = C S = 1 - e - I q p t / Q where P is the infection risk, C is the number of infected occupants in the next generation, S is the total number of susceptible occupants, I is the total number of infected occupants in the current generation, q is the rate of quantum production per infected occupant (quanta/h, related to the type of disease), p is the lung air exchange rate of susceptible occupants (m3/h), t is the total exposure time (h), and Q is the outdoor air ventilation rate (m3/h). In epidemiology, masks are recognized as having a two-way effect. Specifically, the mask reduces both the pathogens concentration entering the indoor air from the wearer's mouth (or nose) and the pathogens concentration entering the wearer's mouth (or nose) from the indoor air. Based on the study of Dai et al. [21], we introduced two additional parameters k1 and k2 into the original Wells-Riley equation to calculate the effect of masks on the indoor infection risk. The dynamically modified W-R model can be constructed based on the infection risk equations for various simple indoor scenarios. When the infected occupant wears a mask but the susceptible occupant does not, the pathogen concentration in the space decreases. At this point, the infection risk P1 can be calculated as (2) P 1 = 1 - e - I ( k 1 × q ) p t / Q where, k1 is the forward filtration (filtration of gas exhaled from the mouth and nose) coefficient of the mask. When the infected occupant does not wear a mask but the susceptible occupant wears one, fewer pathogens are inhaled by susceptible occupants due to the filtering of the masks. At this point, the infection risk P2 can be calculated as (3) P 2 = 1 - e - I q p t / Q k 2 where, k2 is the reverse filtration (filtration of gas inhaled from the mouth and nose) coefficient. When both the infected and susceptible occupants are wearing masks, the filtering effect of the mask should be considered twice. At this point, the infection risk P3 can be calculated as (4) P 3 = 1 - e - I ( k 1 × q ) p t / Q k 2 When neither the infected occupant nor the susceptible occupant is wearing a mask, the W-R model does not need to be corrected. At this point, the infection risk can be calculated according to Eq. (1). Consider a more complex scenario based on the above modified models. In a room with N occupants, assuming that the number of mask wearers detected is M, the dynamic average infection risk can be calculated as (5) P T = 0 , ( N = I ) 1 - e - I ( k 1 × q ) p t / Q k 2 , ( N = M > I ) 1 - e - I q p t / Q , ( N > I , M = 0 ) C M I - N + M C N - M N - M C N I ( 1 - e - [ ( I - N + M ) k 1 q + ( N - M ) q ] p t / Q k 2 ) + ∑ j = I + M - N + 1 L { C M j C N - M I - j C N I N - M - ( I - j ) N - I ( 1 - e - [ j k 1 q + ( I - j ) q ] p t / Q ) + C M j C N - M I - j C N I M - j N - I ( 1 - e - [ j k 1 q + ( I - j ) q ] p t / Q k 2 ) } , ( N ≠ M , I < N ⩽ M + I , L = min { I , M } ) ∑ j = 0 L { C M j C N - M I - j C N I N - M - ( I - j ) N - I ( 1 - e - [ j k 1 q + ( I - j ) q ] p t / Q ) + C M j C N - M I - j C N I M - j N - I ( 1 - e - [ j k 1 q + ( I - j ) q ] p t / Q k 2 ) } , ( N > M + I , L = min { I , M } ) where I is taken as a positive integer. In this study, Eq. (5) was used for dynamic prediction of indoor infection risk and ventilation rate (calculated by computer in real time). The detailed explanation and in-depth simplification about Eq. (5) was provided in Appendix 1. 2.2.4 Ventilation energy consumption The proposed strategy focuses on the intelligent control of outdoor air ventilation rate. In this study, for the energy consumption calculation, the difference between the different ventilation strategies is only reflected in the rate of introducing outdoor air. Therefore, the energy consumption required to introduce outdoor air is used as the main indicator rather than the energy consumption of the entire heating,ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system. In this study, the electrical energy consumed due to the introduction of outdoor air is referred to as ventilation energy consumption [50,51]. The ventilation energy consumption comprises the energy consumption of the air conditioning process and air delivery process [32]. The energy consumption of the air conditioning process refers to the energy required to adjust the outdoor air from the outdoor state to the indoor design state (i.e., the energy required to bear the outdoor air load [50]). The energy consumption of the air conditioning process can be calculated as (6) P C = Q L COP (7) Q L = c p ρ Q Δ T where PC is the energy consumption of the air conditioning process (kW), QL is the load caused by introduction of outdoor air (kW), COP is the air conditioning system performance coefficient (also known as energy efficiency ratio), cp is the constant pressure specific heat capacity of air (kJ/(kg·K)), ρ is the density of air (kg/m3), Q is the outdoor air ventilation rate (m3/s), and ΔT is the temperature difference between indoor and outdoor air (K) (not the temperature difference between outdoor air and the outlet of cooling coil because only the load caused by the introduction of outdoor air is calculated [50,51]). The energy consumption of the air delivery process refers to the energy required to drive the air flow in the ventilation system and can be calculated according to Eq. (8) [32], (8) P F = k Q 3 where PF is the air delivery energy consumption (kW), and k is a factor (determined by the fan type). Therefore, when the air state and relevant equipment are determined, outdoor air ventilation rate is the direct and most important factor that determines ventilation energy consumption for different ventilation modes. The above-mentioned indicator (ventilation energy consumption) was used to evaluate the proposed strategy. However, in order to provide more detailed data and to avoid misunderstandings, the electrical energy consumption of the entire HVAC system was also calculated in detail, as shown in Appendix 2. 2.2.5 Ventilation control strategies The proposed indoor anti-infection ventilation strategy based on occupant-related information was then compared with the common indoor anti-infection ventilation strategy based on the original W-R model. These two ventilation strategies are further described as follows. Strategy 1: Static anti-infection ventilation (based on the original W-R model). This strategy uses the original W-R model to calculate the ventilation rate. According to Eq. (1), this strategy considers only the number of first-generation infected occupants without considering whether the occupants are wearing masks or not. When the number of first-generation infected occupants is determined, the ventilation rate under this strategy will no longer change. The actual infection risk under this strategy is calculated using the modified W-R model proposed in this study (Eq. (5)). Strategy 2: Dynamic anti-infection ventilation (proposed strategy). This strategy is based on computer vision technology, which intelligently adjusts the ventilation rate according to the actual scenario and the ventilation control logic (Fig. 3). Scenario A: When the database shows that there are no occupants in the whole target area, no outdoor air will be fed into the room. At this time, the indoor return air volume is set by considering only the indoor air conditioning load (approximated by equipment load, lighting load, and wall thermal conductivity load). Scenario B: When no one is moving at the entrance or exit of the target area, the ventilation rate obtained from the previous calculation is maintained. Scenario C: When there are occupants moving at the entrance (exit) of the target area, the database is updated according to the number of moving occupants and the mask wearing status of each occupant (obtained by using the face detection model, mask classification model, and trajectory recognition model), and the required ventilation rate is recalculated using Eq. (5). 2.3 Case study 2.3.1 Study design To demonstrate the proposed approach, a case study was performed in a real-life scenario. The case study was conducted in an open-planned office of a university campus. This space is located on the sixth floor with a north\u2013south orientation and an indoor area of 121.52 m2. As shown in Fig. 6 , the room dimensions are × × y × z = 9.8 m × 12.4 m × 3.5 m. The room can accommodate up to 43 occupants simultaneously, has 5 rows of tables and 43 PCs, and an entrance and exit on its northern side. 8 diffuser air supply vents and 6 grille air exhaust vents are installed on the ceiling, forming a widely used airflow pattern for open-plan indoor spaces. The maximum ventilation rate that each diffuser can provide is 1200 m3/h. 2 chillers, model MDS-H120W-A(1)III, are used to provide cooling capacity (or heating capacity), each with a maximum cooling capacity of 12,000 W (maximum heating capacity of 13,500 W). Numerous studies [41\u201343] have shown that airflow organization plays a critical role in the removal of indoor air contaminants, such as viruses. Researchers have long optimized mechanical ventilation to reduce the infection risk by considering certain factors, such as air outlet type [15] and air outlet location [44]. However, this study does not focus on the abovementioned influencing factors and therefore does not evaluate or improve the existing ventilation system in the room. In the target area, the shortest distance between two occupants at the same table was 1.2 m, whereas that between two occupants at different tables was 1.7 m. Such distance does not meet the safe distance required for long working or socializing in a natural state [45,46], and the infection risk must be reduced through effective means, such as adequate mechanical ventilation. The proposed indoor anti-infection ventilation strategy based on occupant-related information is well suited to this kind of scenario to ensure a satisfactory indoor infection risk at a low energy consumption. The experimental steps for the field test are as follows. Step 1: Install video acquisition devices at the entrance (exit) of the target area and ensure that the camera can capture the entire entrance (exit) area (Section 2.3.2). Step 2: Connect the video acquisition device to hardware devices, such as processors and displays, and initialize all these devices. Step 3: Turn on the hardware devices for the trial operation and start the main program. Step 4: Run the main program according to the established logic and functions (Fig. 3) on a trial basis and observe the data processing and storage. Step 5: Formally begin the field test and record the start and end times after ensuring that both the equipment and the program are running properly. Step 6: Process the results (including calculating the identification accuracy, HVAC system energy saving rate, and infection risk). 2.3.2 Experimental arrangement The platform used for the field test consists of a camera unit, a data processing unit, and a screen display unit. For monitoring the entrance and exit of the target area, a camera with 2 K resolution and a retractable bracket (up to 2.1 m) were combined into a single camera unit. As shown in Fig. 7 , two camera units were placed at points A and B. Camera point A was located 5.5 m from the door, 1.1 m from the side wall, and 1.5 m from the ground, whereas camera point B was located 1.5 m from the door, 2.4 m from the side wall, and 1.7 m from the ground. Compared with point A, point B was closer to the door and may cause incomplete face capture. Therefore, the height of camera point B was higher than that of camera point A. A desktop computer with a 64-bit operating system was used as a data processing unit with the following configuration: Xeon(R) E5-2680R CPU (28 cores, 56 threads, 2.40 GHz, dual processor), DDR4 running memory (16G × 4, 2666 MHz), NVIDIA Quadro M2000 discrete graphics card (4G, GDDR5), and NVMe SAMSUNG MZVLB256 disk (256G, SSD). A HP ZR2440w display that supports video playback at a maximum resolution of 2 K was used as the screen display unit. This display can play back the surveillance images in real time and the final video after the image recognition is completed. Even in complex scenarios, the processor and the display can fully satisfy the processing of face detection, mask classification, and trajectory recognition based on the PyramidBox algorithm and play a real-time and smooth video in the display. 3 Results 3.1 Model validation A total of three image recognition models and one infection risk prediction model were used in this study. Among them, the infection risk prediction model (W-R model) has been widely used and validated in the literature [19,21,43]. Therefore, only three image recognition models (face detection model, mask classification model, and trajectory recognition model) were experimentally validated in this section. The videos used for the validation were taken from real scenarios in the case study. Fig. 8 shows how the face detection model and the mask classification model are used in a real scenario. The faces are marked by the bounding box, where green represents wearing a mask and red represents no mask. The first information above the bounding box can also indicate the image recognition result (\u201cMask\u201d means wearing a mask, whereas \u201cNo Mask\u201d means not wearing a mask), and the second information represents the confidence level of the image recognition (a higher confidence level indicates a higher certainty about the result accuracy). The model identifies the scenario in Fig. 8 (a) (single occupant detection) as \u201cthe number of occupants wearing mask is 1, and the number of occupants not wearing mask is 0\u201d with 99.57% confidence and that in Fig. 8 (b) (multi-occupant detection) as \u201cthe number of occupants wearing masks is 1, and the number of occupants not wearing masks is 1\u201d with 95.52% and 99.99% confidence respectively. The above results are in good agreement with the actual status of the occupants in the room. Fig. 9 shows how the trajectory recognition model is used in a real scenario. The scenario includes an occupant without a mask leaving the target area (duration 3.5 s). Results show that the trajectory recognition model can capture the occupant position well and reflect the relative size of the occupant in the picture. According to the recognition method proposed in Section 2.2.2, first, the length of the picture in the x- and y-directions is assumed to be 1 and 2, respectively. Second, the area and center point coordinates of the bounding box in each picture are calculated in turn, and x = 0.75 is taken as the boundary line (according to the actual situation). As shown in Fig. 10 , the transverse coordinate of the center point of the bounding box in Fig. 9 exceeds the boundary line x = 0.75 between T = 2.5 s and T = 3.0 s. In addition, the area of the bounding box and the × coordinate of the center point grow continuously larger until T = 3.0 s. These results satisfy the two requirements specified in Section 2.2.2. Therefore, one can reasonably judge that the occupant left the target area between T = 2.5 s and T = 3.0 s. The system considers both the validated face detection model and the mask classification model and concludes that the number of occupants not wearing masks indoors is reduced by one (see the bottom of Fig. 9 for the real-time prediction results of the system). This conclusion is consistent with the real phenomenon observed in the actual scenario. To further investigate the accuracy of the image recognition model, a 300-minute (9:00:00\u201314:00:00) video (noted as Case A) was used for validation. The video content was recognized by the processor in real time, with 72,000 operations performed over a 5-hour period (4 operations per second). However, given that the ventilation system should not be regulated too frequently, the information in the database was updated every 10 min. As shown in Fig. 11 , the actual values of the number of occupants wearing masks, the number of occupants not wearing masks, and the total number of occupants were compared with the detected values. Specifically, from the 10th to the 210th minutes, the detected values were in perfect agreement with the actual values. However, from the 220th minute onward, the detected value of the number of mask wearing occupant was 1 less than the actual one because of the system error detection. This error was observed up to the 300th minute. The detection error is calculated as (9) δ = T V - D V T V × 100 % where δ is the detection error, TV is the actual value, and DV is the detected value. According to Eq. (9), the average detection error of case A is 1.79%, whereas the maximum detection error is 9.09%, which is acceptable in engineering terms. In summary, the three image recognition models used in this study, including the face detection model, mask classification 1model, and trajectory recognition model were validated for this case study. 3.2 Evaluation of indoor infection risk Infection risk, which is an important indicator characterizing indoor resistance to the spread of epidemics, was used to evaluate the proposed indoor ventilation strategy based on occupant-related information. The proposed dynamic modified W-R model (Eq. (5)) was used to calculate infection risk. Appendix 3 and 4 show the related parameter settings. The safety value of infection risk was set to 1% [15,21]. Fig. 12 shows 10 typical scenarios (Case 1 to Case 10, which were shown in Appendix 3) whose theoretical values are calculated when the number of primordial infections is set to I = 1 and I = 2. The prediction results of the proposed dynamic modified W-R model can change depending on these scenarios, which is not possible with the original W-R model or other modifications. Results show some significant differences among the values for the five typical scenarios, in which the ventilation rates for the two extreme scenarios can differ by 75%. According to Eqs. (6) and (8), the ventilation energy consumption for the five typical scenarios can also differ significantly. In addition, as the number of primary infections increases, the impact of masks on indoor ventilation rates becomes increasingly significant. Refined environmental control plays a critical role in ventilation. Different levels of outdoor air ventilation according to the actual scenario can balance the relationship between ventilation rate and infection risk to the greatest extent. In a practical scenario, Case A (which was shown in Appendix 3) was used to compare the differences between the two ventilation strategies (Section 2.2.5). As shown in Fig. 13 , ventilation strategy 1 and ventilation strategy 2 exhibit significantly different characteristics in terms of anti-infection ventilation. Overall, ventilation strategy 1 used a larger ventilation rate to control the infection risk at a lower level, whereas ventilation strategy 2 used a smaller ventilation rate to control the infection risk at a level slightly higher than the former. The ventilation rate for strategy 1 was kept at 2866 m3/h, whereas the infection risk fluctuated between 0.25% and 1% when the mask wearing situation changed. For ventilation strategy 2, the ventilation rate fluctuated between 716 m3/h and 2866 m3/h along with actual conditions to maintain the infection risk at 1%. However, these strategies did not differ in all cases. Specifically, they reported the same ventilation rate (2866 m3/h) and infection risk (1%) from the 180th to the 200th minute. 3.3 Evaluation of ventilation energy consumption Numerous studies [15,18\u201321] have shown that a greater amount of outdoor air corresponds to a lower probability of spreading airborne infections. Having too little outdoor air may cause severe infections at times of epidemics. However, having more outdoor air enter the room does not always lead to a better outcome. Specifically, an outdoor air ventilation rate reaching a certain value can sufficiently meet the indoor epidemic prevention requirements, but increasing the ventilation rate beyond this point will only increase the ventilation systems load, thereby wasting energy. Therefore, a ventilation strategy that can meet the requirements of indoor epidemic prevention without wasting the energy should be developed. Case A was used to compare the ventilation energy consumption of the two ventilation strategies (Section 2.2.5). The ventilation energy consumption was calculated using Eqs. (6) to (8).Appendix 2 shows the related parameter settings. Table 1 shows the energy consumption of air conditioning and air delivery for ventilation strategy 1 and ventilation strategy 2. In 5 h, ventilation strategy 1 requires a total of 46861.42 kJ (39595.61 kJ of air conditioning energy and 7265.81 kJ of air delivery energy), whereas ventilation strategy 2 needs a total of 17306.26 kJ (16296.46 kJ of air conditioning energy and 1009.80 kJ of air delivery energy). Based on ventilation strategy 1, the energy saving rate of ventilation strategy 2 in terms of ventilation energy consumption is 63.07%. In addition, according to Appendix 2, the energy saving rate of ventilation strategy 2 in terms of the energy consumption of the whole HVAC system is 34.20%. 3.4 Platform introduction and function test Case A was handled by an expensive desktop computer (Section 2.3.2), which was high performance but not easy to install or move. Such a hardware platform (Section 2.3.2) provided sufficient computing power, but was not conducive to practical engineering applications. To implement the proposed indoor anti-infection ventilation strategy based on occupant-related information, a low-cost (roughly $70) and portable hardware platform was built and tested in multiple scenarios. This section provides some references for practical engineering applications and can guide the deployment of related algorithms on the mobile side. As shown in Fig. 14 , the hardware platform mainly comprises an imager, a micro motherboard, a fan, a display, a memory card, and several connection cables. More relevant details are presented in Appendix 5. To improve accuracy as much as possible, the image processing frequency needs to be 4 frames/s or greater. In other words, the CPU and GPU should have sufficient computing and image processing power to run the image recognition model more than 4 times in 1 s. In addition, the computational speed of the image recognition model greatly depends on the complexity of the scenario. The background of the target area selected for this study has a certain degree of complexity, and the selected scenarios often involve multiple occupants. At this level of scenario complexity, the Raspberry Pi 4B comes equipped with a processor whose performance can fully meet the requirements of real-time prediction (i.e., the Raspberry Pi 4B can process about 30 images per second in this scenario). As the scenario complexity decreases or increases, the processor should be appropriately tuned to meet the engineering requirements. A 150-minute test video (same scenario as Case A, noted as Case B, which was shown in Appendix 3) was used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed hardware platform. The hardware platform was operated according to the flow shown in Fig. 14, intervening every 5 min on the turbine speed. An anemometer (instruments 7 and 8 in Fig. 14) was used to measure the real-time wind speed of the turbine to react to the control effect. The active change of the fan speed had a 3 s delay, which can be ascribed to the way the fan is controlled and the computing power of the microprocessor, which is not considered an error in this work. Fig. 15 illustrates the variation of fan speed ratio with time. As the number of mask wearers and non-wearers in the room varied with time, the experimental values of the fan speed ratio fluctuated between 0.095 and 1.151. At the 10th and 45th minutes, the fan speed significantly increased due to the larger proportion of non-mask wearers. Overall, the average error between the experimental and desired values of fan speed ratio can be calculated as 9.89% according to Eq. (9), which is acceptable in engineering terms. 4 Discussion 4.1 Computer vision-assisted occupant detection This work combines computer vision with occupant-centric environmental control for anti-infection intelligent ventilation. In this strategy, the judgment of the mask wearing situation in the target area mainly relies on the face detection model and the mask classification model. These two models not only have good recognition effect in bright scenarios (Fig. 8 (b)) but also effectively recognize facial features in dark scenarios (Fig. 8 (a)). Their recognition performance depends on the height of the camera arrangement, the size of the visual field, the algorithm, and the scenario brightness. In this study, the cameras were arranged at 1.7 m and 1.5 m heights to adequately capture the complete faces of occupants. In engineering applications, cameras are often placed on top of side walls or ceilings, which can also meet the requirements of face recognition under general circumstances. However, if the camera field of view is too large, then faces of extremely different sizes may appear in the image at the same time, thereby reducing the recognition accuracy to a certain extent [27,40]. In this case, a too large camera field of view should be avoided in the project. The trajectory recognition model is another important component of the proposed intelligent ventilation strategy. Figs. 5 and 8 only show the principle and effect of trajectory recognition in a single-occupant scenario, respectively, and the recognition results can meet the expectations. However, in a multi-occupant scenario, all the aforementioned image recognition models may produce errors due to the mutual occlusion of occupants. The error between the actual and detected values in Fig. 11 can be ascribed to this reason (i.e., during the experiment, multiple occupants close to each other enter the target area at the same time, thereby causing the number of detected occupants to be one less than the actual number). The optimization and solution of this error are not within the scope of this work. It should be noted that the used computer vision algorithms must have good privacy protection. Subtracting foreground objects (e.g., occupants) from the background and representing them as pixels of a single color is a general approach [28]. In addition, the lightweight model used in this study can be arranged directly on mobile devices that are not networked (e.g., microcontrollers for ventilation systems), reducing the privacy leakage due to networking. In terms of model validation, both image based validation and long video based validation were included. In addition, the models used were validated in dark scenarios, bright scenarios, single-occupant scenarios, and multi-occupant scenarios. Therefore, the validation results can be considered to have some confidence. In the related studies by Wang et al [32], Tang et al [27], and Wang et al [28], the average detection errors of computer vision algorithms for face recognition, occupant localization, and action recognition were 7.5%, 3.9%, and 8.9%, respectively, while the average detection error in this study was 1.79%. The detection error in this study was slightly lower than in previous related studies, which may be due to a variety of reasons. On the one hand, this study scientifically combined several computer vision techniques to improve the accuracy rate; on the other hand, the application scenarios involved in this study were relatively simple and the placement of cameras is reasonable. In addition, the computational power of the processor was also a possible influencing factor, as more computational power means the ability to detect images more frequently. 4.2 Infection risk and ventilation control The safe value of indoor infection risk was set to 1%. Exceeding this value can be detrimental to controlling indoor airborne infections, but a value below this level may lead to exponentially higher ventilation energy consumption [21]. Fig. 13 illustrates the characteristics of ventilation strategies 1 and 2 in terms of anti-infection ventilation. These strategies demonstrated significant differences from the 10th to 170th minutes and from the 210th to 300th minutes due to the presence of more mask wearers and fewer non-wearers. Ventilation strategy 1 reported excessive ventilation during this period, that is, the extremely high ventilation rate was used to further reduce the infection risk that had already reached the standard. From the 180th to 200th minute, these strategies demonstrated an identical performance due to the absence of mask wearers. In fact, a greater percentage of mask wearers corresponded to a greater difference in the performance of these strategies; conversely, a smaller percentage of mask wearers corresponded to a smaller difference. Eq. (5) shows that the number of primary infected occupants, quantum production rate, exposure time, safety value of infection risk, and filtration coefficient of masks are all important factors affecting the difference between these strategies. Therefore, appropriate values should be assigned to these variables for different occasions. For example, in the case of high epidemic prevention and control requirements, the safety value of infection risk needs to be appropriately reduced or the exposure time needs to be extended according to the relevant epidemic prevention standards [32]. On the other hand, whether the proposed ventilation control strategy can be implemented in the existing HVAC system is a great concern. Totally relying on the infection risk to adjust the airflow may be result in an extremely large value that goes far beyond the capacity of the HVAC system. According to the information provided in Section 2.3.1, the maximum ventilation rate that the HVAC system can provide is 9600 m3/h and the maximum cooling capacity is 12,000 W (maximum heating capacity is 13,500 W). Considering the required ventilation rate shown in Fig. 13 and the required cooling capacity shown in Appendix 2, the proposed ventilation strategy can be applied to the current HVAC system. When the number of infected occupants is too large, the proposed strategy may not be able to control the infection risk without exceeding the capacity of the HVAC system. In this case, a combination of other means such as disinfection, physical barriers, and medications may be considered [7,32]. 4.3 Control platform To facilitate the engineering applications, a low-cost platform (roughly $70) was built in this work. A 9.89% error was generated when the hardware platform was used for the experiment, which can be mainly attributed to the influence of the room air conditioning system on the anemometer and to the performance of the fans used in the experiment. Results of functional tests on the hardware platform show that this platform can fully implement the proposed ventilation strategy and provide a reference for engineering applications. The effectiveness of vaccines will be reduced along with the continuous mutation of airborne viruses [13]. A prototype hardware platform equipped with an intelligent ventilation strategy can present a promising solution to this problem. According to Wang et al. [32], the most important part of the hardware platform is the processor, which can determine the highest complexity of the scenario allowed to achieve real-time detection. For the selected target area, the Raspberry Pi 4B demonstrated a sufficiently good computational performance. Given that the lifetime of the ventilation system should not be damaged, although real-time occupant detection can be achieved, the ventilation rate should not always be regulated in real time [47]. To make the actual ventilation rate close to the expected value, the frequency of ventilation system control should be adjusted according to the pedestrian flow. For example, the ventilation rate can be adjusted every minute during peak pedestrian flow periods and adjusted in real time outside these periods. 4.4 Limitations and future work Occupant-centeredness and intelligence are inevitable trends in future environmental regulations to dynamically meet the needs of occupants while saving human resources and reducing carbon emissions. This idea of environmental control is not only limited to office space but also be applied in nursing homes, kindergartens, airports, hospitals, and other places, even outdoors. The proposed occupant-centric environmental control strategy can provide a reference for future research in these areas. However, this work still has several limitations that need to be addressed in future research. First, given that the proposed intelligent ventilation strategy does not have any correction function, detection errors may persist and stack continuously (Fig. 11) until the system resets the database. In this regard, future research should enhance the recognition capability of the algorithm or use a combination of multiple cameras for detection. Second, this study assumes that the cumulative value of detection at the entrance and exit is the detection value of the whole target area. However, in practice, the state of an occupant when entering or leaving the target area is not fully representative of his/her state when staying in the target area. Therefore, future research may place cameras inside the target area instead of at the entrance or exit for real-time indoor detection. Third, this work does not consider certain indicators, such as indoor temperature, humidity, and air velocity. In fact, ventilation can affect all these indicators [48]. If the ventilation rate is varied frequently based on the infection risk, the thermal environment of the room may not be guaranteed. Future studies may also consider examining the effect of intelligent anti-infection ventilation on indoor thermal comfort. Fourth, this study focuses on the overall ventilation control in the target area. However, the distribution of occupants in this area may be not uniform. Therefore, even if the average infection risk meets the requirements, the local infection risk is highly likely to exceed the criteria. Especially in large indoor spaces, occupants are likely to be clustered in several sub-zones. Future research may apply the proposed ventilation strategy to each scientifically defined sub-zone to achieve an intelligent zonal ventilation control. In addition, combining the simulation with the occupant-centric control may also work well [26]. Fifth, the proposed strategy relies on the appearance of occupants (wearing masks) to achieve environmental control from the anti-infection ventilation perspective. With the rapid development of computer vision technology, future studies may consider exploring other aspects of environmental control from the perspectives of occupant micro-expression monitoring and occupant motion detection. A comprehensive combination of computer vision technology and occupant-centric concept can also provide a new direction for environmental control. 5 Conclusion This study combines computer vision with occupant-centric environmental control to propose an intelligent indoor anti-infection ventilation strategy based on occupant-related information with an aim to dynamically maintain indoor infection risk near a specific safety value while reducing ventilation energy consumption during epidemic and post-epidemic periods. This work helps balance the relationship between ventilation energy consumption and infection risk and can provide some references for air health promotion and occupant-centric dynamic control. The main findings of this work are summarized as follows: (1) The coupled use of face detection model, mask classification model, and trajectory recognition model is suitable for the proposed intelligent ventilation strategy. The average detection error of Case A was 1.79%, and the maximum detection error was 9.09%, both of which meet the requirements of engineering applications. (2) This study proposed a modified W-R model that considers the dynamic effects of masks for indoor occupants and can be used to calculate the average theoretical value of infection risk in real scenarios during an epidemic or post-epidemic period. (3) Compared with the static anti-infection ventilation strategy (strategy 1) based on the original W-R model, the dynamic anti-infection ventilation strategy (strategy 2 or the proposed strategy) based on the proposed modified W-R model (Eq. (5)) has better adaptive capacity and energy savings. The proposed strategy can dynamically maintain the indoor infection risk near a specific value and avoid overventilation while meeting epidemic prevention requirements. Moreover, the proposed strategy saves 63.07% of ventilation energy consumption (saves 34.20% of energy consumption of HVAC system). (4) A low-cost hardware platform was built to implement the proposed ventilation strategy, and the experimental results were compared with the expected results to provide a reference for engineering applications.

Appendix 1 The detailed explanation and in-depth simplification about Eq. (5) The Eq. (5) was derived based on Eqs. (1), (2), (3) and (4), taking into account the probabilities. The infection risk was directly related to the numbers of infected and susceptible occupants, with separate consideration for masked and unmasked individuals. Eq. (5) was complicated due to the uncertainty in the relationship between the number of occupants in the room, the number of occupants infected, the number of occupants wearing masks, and the number of occupants not wearing masks. To improve clarity and comprehensibility, Eq. (5) was simplified in this section and the parameter relationships and their relevance to the real-world situations were explained in detail. Considering the engineering implications and previous studies [15,21,32], the number of infected occupants was assumed to be 1. In addition, it is assumed that at least two occupants are present in the room. Based on the above assumptions, Eq. (5) can be simplified as follows according to different real-world scenarios: To make the equation concise, V was used to represent e - q p t / Q , and U was used to represent the number of detected occupants without masks, as shown in Eqs. (1.1) and (1.2). (1.1) V = e - q p t / Q , (1.2) U = N - M . When all occupants do not wear masks (i.e., M = 0), Eq. (5) can be reduced to Eq. (1.3). (1.3) P T = 1 - V . When all occupants wear masks (i.e., M = N), Eq. (5) can be reduced to Eq. (1.4). (1.4) P T = 1 - V k 1 k 2 . When both masked occupants and unmasked occupants are present indoors, there are two different prediction equations. First, if only one occupant is not wearing a mask (i.e., U = 1), Eq. (5) can be reduced to Eq. (1.5). Second, if more than one occupant is not wearing a mask (i.e., U greater than 1), Eq. (5) can be reduced to Eq. (1.6). (1.5) P T = 1 - V k 2 N + M ( 1 - V k 1 ) N ( N - 1 ) + M ( M - 1 ) ( 1 - V k 1 k 2 ) N ( N - 1 ) , (1.6) P T = U ( U - 1 ) ( 1 - V ) N ( N - 1 ) + MU [ ( 1 - V k 1 ) + ( 1 - V k 2 ) ] N ( N - 1 ) + M ( M - 1 ) ( 1 - V k 1 k 2 ) N ( N - 1 ) . The difference between Eq. (1.5) and Eq. (1.6) is that Eq. (1.6) additionally takes into account the infection risk among multiple occupants who do not wear masks. Appendix 2 Calculation of electrical energy consumption of the entire HVAC system The case study was conducted in summer, so only the cooling load was calculated. The cooling loads can be calculated by Eq. (2.1), (2.1) Q Total = Q W + Q R + Q P + Q L + Q E + Q I + Q F + Q O , where QTotal is the total cooling load of the HVAC system (kW); QW is the cooling load caused by heat transfer through the envelope (kW); QR is the cooling load caused by solar radiation entering the room through the glass window (kW); QP is the cooling load caused by occupant heat dissipation (kW); QF is the cooling load caused by lighting heat dissipation (kW); QE is the cooling load caused by equipment heat dissipation (kW); QI is the cooling load caused by the air infiltrating into the room from outdoors (kW); QL is the cooling load caused by the introduction of outdoor air (kW); QO is the cooling load caused by other factors such as food (kW). Since the target room is mainly illuminated by natural light and energy-saving lamps and the doors and windows are well airtight, the cooling load from lighting and air infiltration is small and is ignored in this study. The cooling load caused by other factors, such as food, is also ignored due to the strong uncertainty. According to the standard [51], the calculation is based on steady-state heat transfer because the allowable fluctuation range of room temperature is greater than 1 °C. The equations for calculating the cooling load caused by heat transfer through the envelope are as follows: (2.2) Q W = Q EW + Q IW (2.3) Q EW = K F ( T IT - T DT ) / 1000 (2.4) T IT = T AT + α J A α E (2.5) Q IW = K F ( T AT + Δ T AR - T DT ) / 1000 where, QEW is the cooling load caused by heat transfer from external walls or windows (kW); K is the heat transfer coefficient of the envelope (W/m2·K); F is the area of the envelope (m2); TIT is the average outdoor sol\u2013air temperature (℃); TDT is the indoor design temperature (℃); TAT is the average outdoor temperature (℃); α is the absorption coefficient of the external surface of the envelope for solar radiation heat; JA is the daily average of total solar irradiance (W/m2); αE is the heat transfer coefficient of the external surface of the envelope (W/m2·K); QIW is the cooling load caused by heat transfer from the interior walls and floors (kW); ΔTAR is the difference between the average temperature of the adjacent room and the average outdoor temperature (℃). The assumptions and explanations for the relevant parameters are shown in Table 2.1 and Table 2.2 . The south and east walls of the target room are adjacent to the outdoors (with external windows on the south wall), and the north and west walls are adjacent to the rooms without air conditioning. According to the relevant standard [51], the cooling load caused by heat transfer from the envelope is calculated, as shown in Table 2.2. The cooling load caused by solar radiation entering the room through the glass window can be calculated by Eq. (2.6), (2.6) Q R = C B C C C E C I C G D MAX F W where, CB is the cooling load coefficient when using standard glass; CC is the comprehensive shading coefficient of the external window; CE is the external shading correction coefficient; CI is the internal shading correction coefficient; CG is the glass correction coefficient; DMAX is the maximum daylight heat factor (kW/m2); FW is the net area of the window glass (m2). According to the calculation in Table 2.3 , the cooling load caused by the solar radiation entering the room through the glass window is 0.69 kW. In addition, the heat dissipation of occupant is taken as 0.13 kW/person, and the heat dissipation of equipment is taken as 0.15 kW/unit only considering computers (assuming that the number of computers turned on is equal to the number of occupants). In summary, according to Eq. (2.1), the total load of the HVAC system is (3.78 + 0.69 + 0.28 N + QL ) kW (N is the number of occupants in the room). Considering the data in Table 1 and Fig. 11, the total energy consumption of the HVAC system for the two ventilation strategies is shown in Table 2.4 .

A 5-megapixel CSI camera (Camera Module V1) was selected as the primary imager, and a 2-megapixel USB camera (Logitech C920) was used as a backup imager for video input. The Raspberry Pi 4B with an ARM architecture and a Linux system was used as the micro motherboard. Raspberry Pi 4B comes equipped with a 4-core 64-bit CPU (main frequency of 1.5 Hz), a GPU with a main frequency of 500 MHz, and 8 G of LPDDR4 memory to achieve the computing speed and accuracy necessary for this study. A 12 V/0.5A fan (called ventilation fan) with a maximum speed of 4600 rpm was used to change the ventilation rate while considering the need for wind speed adjustment. Meanwhile, a low power fan (5 V/0.2A, called heat sink fan) was used to dissipate heat from the motherboard. An OLED screen with a resolution of 128*32 was used to display the operating status of the whole device, and a 128G SD card was used to store the experimental data. Connection cables were used to connect the CSI camera, USB camera, ventilation fan, heat sink fan, and OLED display to the Raspberry Pi 4B. References [1] B.

        "dc:description": "Occupant-centric control of the environment carries outstanding significance in several fields. Especially in the context of epidemics, occupant-centric environmental control can contribute to the prevention and energy saving. From the perspective of anti-infection ventilation, the traditional approach is to make static corrections to the Wells-Riley (W-R) model according to the environmental characteristics to calculate a reasonable ventilation rate. However, frequent changes in the actual scenario (e.g., occupant status) can easily lead to the failure of such static ventilation in achieving its expected effects, thereby resulting in increased ventilation energy consumption and fluctuations in infection risk. In this study, an intelligent anti-infection ventilation strategy is proposed by combining computer vision with occupant-centric control. Results show that the proposed strategy can dynamically maintain the infection risk around a target value (e.g., 1%). Compared with the ventilation strategy based on a static W-R model, the proposed strategy saves 63.07% of ventilation energy consumption (saves 34.20% of energy consumption of HVAC system). A hardware platform is also built and tested to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed strategy. This study contributes new ideas to balance the energy required for ventilation with the infection risk, and provides a reference for occupant-centric dynamic control and building occupants\u2019 health.",
