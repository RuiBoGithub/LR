Robust strategies are essentially needed in building energy systems for meeting load demands stably under uncertainty, whereas demand response (DR) can serve the grid through flexible operation and achieve remarkable economic benefits. However, formulating optimal control strategies that enable weighing robustness and flexibility for energy systems is quite challenging and rarely addressed owing to their conflicting control objectives. In this paper, a dual-objective coordinated optimization approach is proposed and applied to the heating system of an office building equipped with heat pumps, to balance the robustness and flexibility of DR control under building load uncertainty. The load distribution interval is predicted by the quantile regression neural network model. And optimal DR strategies are performed via modulating indoor temperature set-points. Using the genetic algorithm and multi-objective decision-making optimization framework, the optimal strategy can be obtained by weighing the confidence level of load prediction interval and the operating cost of flexible operation. The results show that, compared with the robust optimal strategy, the coordinated optimal strategy reduces the operating cost by 35.8% with robustness that meets actual demands in 80% of the cases. Compared to the flexible optimal strategy, it sacrifices only 0.05% cost but increases the load guaranteed hours by 33.3%.

Building energy consumption occupies more than 70 % of the total energy usage [2], and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems are the main energy consumers in buildings [3]. Fortunately, flexible demand-side resources are available to assist in guaranteeing power balance [4]. Building electricity usage can be regulated by utilizing the thermal inertia of building thermal mass (BTM) to serve the grid with very little influence on thermal comfort [5,6]. Demand response (DR) is an economically efficient way to achieve energy flexibility in buildings. Normal electricity consumption patterns are changed by customers in response to tariff changes or incentives to reduce peak electricity consumption when market prices are high or grid stability is threatened [7]. Optimization algorithms are often applied to fully exploit the flexibility potential through DR optimal control [8,9]. Meanwhile, DR can be easily integrated with intelligent energy management systems [10]. Therefore, the implementation of optimal DR control in buildings has significant implications for peak energy consumption reduction, grid stability, and user economics [11]. Previous studies have intensely investigated how to achieve flexible operation of building energy equipment with optimal DR control. Among them, direct load shedding and load shifting are two main DR schemes [12]. The former can reduce peak load by directly shutting down unimportant power equipment in a very short time [13]. Shan et al. [13] managed to decrease 7.8 % peak power demand by directly limiting the chillers\u2019 power. However, because direct load shedding is a fast DR scheme for responding to emergency requests from the smart grid, consumers' thermal comfort might be sacrificed to unacceptable degrees [14]. In contrast, load shifting is widely used due to its high energy flexibility by peak-cutting and valley-filling [15] and satisfactory indoor thermal comfort through model predictive control [16]. Zone temperature reset [17] and precooling/preheating in the morning or evening [18] are common loadshifting measures. W.J.N. Turner et al. [19] investigated the effect of different durations and indoor temperature set-points of precooling before the peak (16:00\u201320:00) on peak demand reduction through BTM, with all conditions shifting at least 50 % peak load to off-peak, and without affecting occupant thermal comfort. Xu et al. [20] applied precooling and different zone temperature reset (TR) strategies during power peak (12:00\u201318:00) in office buildings. The best strategy was precooling plus exponential reset, reducing peak energy consumption by 40 %, and receiving no complaints. Besides, Yin et al. [21] proposed \u201cexponential, linear, step TRs\u201d to optimize the cooling capacity charge/discharge process of BTM, with 15 % to 30 % peak load reduction during 12:00\u201318:00. Chen et al. [22] found that passive BTM is effective for short-term (0.5 h) and intermediate-term (2 h) DR projects through an experimental investigation. Nevertheless, there are multiple electricity peaks in a day in China (e.g., 8:00 ∼ 11:00 and 18:00 ∼ 23:00), according to the time-of-use (TOU) tariff. DR strategies utilizing passive thermal mass for single power usage peak couldn\u2019t effectively reduce energy consumption in multiple peaks over a relatively long-time span simultaneously. And energy flexibility to shift peak load can be considerably underestimated. It is worth further investigating the peak load shifting capacity by implementing suitable DR strategies in different electricity peaks for better flexibility. In addition, preheating and TR was also shown to be very effective to reduce the morning peak (6:00\u20139:00) heating load, in specific, reducing up to 87 % energy usage in literature [23]. Konstantin et al. [24] evaluated the load shifting potential of different storage options. They claimed that the BTM is more suitable to function as efficient thermal storage in the heating season than in the cooling season. Although optimal DR control itself is critical to the exploitation of energy flexibility potential, an effective DR strategy relies on accurate load prediction under uncertainty [25]. Uncertainty in load forecasting may cause DR using traditional deterministic model predictive control (MPC) to fall short of expected benefits (e.g., resulting in a reduction from 8.5 % to 4.1 % in cost savings [15]) and may fail to meet energy demand in practice [26]. Hence, two techniques have been employed to deal with uncertainty: stochastic optimization and robust optimization (RO) [27]. As the most widely used stochastic optimization method, Monte Carlo simulation characterizes uncertainty by generating stochastic scenarios and probability distribution assumptions [28]. Gao et al. [15] adopted Monte Carlo methods to obtain the optimal DR control signal for commercial buildings and achieved a 7.3 % daily electricity cost saving. Amadeh et al. [29] quantified demand flexibility under uncertainty based on stochastic MPC. They demonstrated that load uncertainty has a significant impact on energy flexibility. Sean et al. [30] chose Latin hypercube sampling and scenario optimization to model load prediction uncertainty and then investigated demand-side control strategies. They claimed that the stochastic MPC using thermal mass for load shifting outperformed the traditional deterministic set-point temperature control mode with no DR measures for operating cost reduction, and ensures more stable control performance in response to uncertainties. Li et al. [26] proposed a dual time-scale coordinated optimal control method to optimize energy dispatch among building energy systems, in which stochastic optimization was used to deal with forecast uncertainty to ensure that the actual load demand is met while maximizing revenue. Nevertheless, stochastic optimization requires the hypothesis of parameter distribution and the introduction of abundant random scenarios to accurately describe the uncertainties, which results in computational complexity [31]. And real-world data sets do not necessarily conform to a certain distribution assumption and thus the prediction performance can be negatively affected [32]. However, most studies on flexible operational optimal control of buildings apply parametric methods of stochastic optimization to quantify load uncertainty. To obviate the limitations of stochastic optimization, robust optimization is applied to predict the set of uncertainty intervals [33], which is statistically assumption-free without generating scenarios [34], computationally simpler and more reliable [35]. Mohammadali et al. [36] proposed a robust energy uncertainty modeling approach for PV/fuel cell/battery hybrid energy systems. The interval optimization approach was used to obtain risk constraints on system operation and convert the problem into a multi-objective optimization. Reference [37] described the uncertainty of wind generation and energy consumption in the form of prediction intervals in a RO microgrid management framework, with upper and lower bounds estimated by a genetic algorithm-neural network. The objective was to determine the level of uncertainty associated with \u201cextreme\u201d conditions. Compared to direct interval prediction based on upper and lower bounds, quantile regression (QR) can provide more comprehensive future information by giving a series of conditional quartiles of the response variables [32]. Moreover, traditional load prediction models can be incorporated with QR to directly generate probability distribution interval results in form of quartiles, with superiority over interval prediction and QR. For instance, the quantile regression neural network (QRNN) model has been investigated on uncertainty prediction performance of renewable energy generation and building loads. He et al. [32] proposed an integrated approach based on QRNN model and advanced data processing technologies for prediction of wind power with stochastic and intermittent nature. The accuracy and superiority of the proposed model were evidenced using six wind power datasets. Ding et al. [38] performed RO of cooling system commissioning strategies, and QRNN was exploited to accurately predict building cooling load uncertainties. The output of robust MPC can be more conservative than deterministic MPC for stable operation under uncertainty, but overly conservative MPC may undermine the flexibility potential of energy systems [29]. Some researchers [30] suggested evaluating the benefits and risks of deterministic MPC and robust MPC before making a decision. This means that only one benefit can be guaranteed at the sacrifice of the other. Ali Amadeh et al. [29] found that deterministic MPC overestimates flexibility and produces comfort violations, while the over-conservatism of robust MPC leads to high energy consumption. From the literature review, optimal DR control and robust optimization for load uncertainty in buildings have been investigated extensively. However, system performance considering only energy flexibility can be negatively affected by unstable load demand and fail to achieve the expected results, while the pursuit of robustness leads to over-conservative strategies and degrades the flexibility of the system. Owing to their conflicting control objectives, formulating optimal control strategies that enable weighing robustness and flexibility for building heating systems is quite challenging and rarely addressed. To fill this gap, this study is devoted to developing a dual-objective optimization method through rational characterization of robustness and flexibility. The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows: firstly, the QRNN model is adopted to directly predict the load distribution interval under uncertainty in form of quantiles, and the confidence level is used as the robustness index for robust optimization. Secondly, optimal DR control strategies are developed to maximize energy flexibility via modulating temperature set-points in a day according to different load shifting schemes implemented at different peaks. Thirdly, a technical framework merging the genetic algorithm and multi-objective decision-making is established to provide the coordinated optimal control strategy for building heating systems by weighing the confidence level of heat supply and economic benefits from the flexible operation. The superiority of the coordinated optimal strategy was demonstrated by comparing the load guarantee rates and operating costs of single-objective optimal scenarios. Considerable field measurements of an office building equipped with heat pumps were implemented, and monitored data was used as inputs to develop the load prediction model and energy system model. The measured meteorological and load data as well as the local TOU tariff were considered in developing the control strategy for increasing the practical value. The remainder of this study is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the structure of the research process to obtain the optimal strategy. Section 3 introduces the case study and DR control rules. Section 4 presents the results and comparative analysis to verify the superiority of the proposed optimal strategy. Section 5 gives the conclusions. 2 Methodology This section is divided into five parts: part 1 introduces the load interval prediction process using QRNN model. Part 2 defines the robustness issue and the flexibility issue of the building heating system control. Part 3 describes the technical framework for the solution of the dual-objective coordinated optimization problem. Part 4 introduces the scenario setting. Part 5 establishes the flexibility evaluation index of the demand response strategy. The research framework is presented inFig.1. 2.1 Load uncertainty interval prediction method 2.1.1 Quantile regression neural network algorithm Quantile regression is proposed to explore the complete distribution of the predicted values [39], which uses the quantile of the explanatory variables to describe the regression variables. For a vector (X, Y) consisting of input variable X and load Y, if the sample sequence X i , Y i , i = 1 , . . . , n satisfy the regression model shown in Eq. (1), where the error term ∊ i i = 1 , . . . n are independently and identically distributed series with unknown distribution, then the τ quantile of Y can be calculated by Eq. (2). (1) Y = m X + ∊ , X ∈ ℝ (2) m τ ( x ) = a r g m i n θ ∈ R E ρ τ Y - θ | X = x Where θ is an arbitrary real number and ρ τ ( x ) is the loss function of quantile regression, defined as Eq. (3). (3) ρ τ ( x ) = τ x , x ≥ 0 τ - 1 x , x < 0 The relationship between the load Y and relevant variable X at different quartiles can be obtained by minimizing the loss function at different quartiles τ. Unlike traditional linear quantile regression models that restrict the independent and dependent variables to a linear relationship, the QRNN model is well adapted to nonlinear relationships, modeled as Fig. 2 . In the model structure shown in Fig. 2, the number of input layer variables m is equal to the number of output variables (load values at a given moment). The number of nodes in the implicit layer n is set to 8. The process of model training is the process of fitting the weight coefficients between the input, implicit, and output layers. The training of neural network models for different quartiles is implemented by changing the quantile τ in the loss function to predict the load for different quartiles. Thus, the load distribution under uncertainty can be acquired. For the independent variable X = x i , i = 1 . . . m , X ∈ R k , the corresponding n-dimensional dependent variable under τ quantile, Y ( τ ) , is defined as (4) Y τ = f X , W τ , V τ = g 2 ∑ j = 0 n v j τ g 1 ∑ i = 0 n w j , i τ x i Where, f X , W ( τ ) , V ( τ ) is a nonlinear function consisting of weights. W τ = w j , i τ , j = 1 , 2 , . . . m , i = 1 , 2 , . . . n is the weight coefficient matrix from input layer to hidden layer. V ( τ ) = v j ( τ ) , j = 1 , 2 , . . . m is the weight coefficient vector from the hidden layer to the output layer. g 1 ( ∙ ) , g 2 ( ∙ ) are the activation equations between the input layer and hidden layer, and between the hidden layer and output layer, respectively. QRNN training process is to estimate the parameters w j , i τ and v j ( τ ) to obtain the optimal solution F, as defined in Eq. (5) and Eq. (6). (5) F = min W ( τ ) , V ( τ ) E λ W ( τ ) , V ( τ ) (6) E λ W τ , V τ = ∑ i = 1 N ρ τ Y i τ - f X i , W τ , V τ + λ 1 ∑ j , k w j , k 2 + λ 2 ∑ j v j 2 = ∑ i | Y i ≥ f X i , W τ , V τ τ | Y i - f X i , W τ , V τ | + ∑ i | Y i < f X i , W τ , V τ 1 - τ | Y i - f X i , W τ , V τ | + λ 1 ∑ j , k w j , k 2 + λ 2 ∑ j v j 2 Where, λ 1 ∑ j , k w j , k 2 , λ 2 ∑ j v j 2 are the regular terms added to prevent the overfitting problem and improve the generalization ability of the model. Resolving the optimization issue of min W ( τ ) , V ( τ ) E λ W ( τ ) , V ( τ ) , the QRNN model for each quantile τ can be obtained. Load probability distribution as well as the load distribution interval can be obtained by combining the load prediction results for each quantile. Prediction interval (PI) consists of upper and lower bounds of load values and its confidence level should be high enough to cover the vast majority of possible target load values. Two ineluctable uncertainty factors in practical projects, meteorological parameters [40], and indoor occupancy [41] are mainly considered. Accordingly, the input parameters of the QRNN model include: time (i), outdoor air temperature ( T out ) and its historical value ( T out , t - i ), outdoor air humidity ( RH out ) and its historical value ( RH out , t - i ), solar radiation intensity ( SR ) and its historical value ( SR t - i ), indoor temperature setting ( T in ) and its historical value ( T in , t - i ), indoor occupancy ( O C C ). The output is the load prediction interval for the next time step. 2.1.2 Interval prediction accuracy evaluation index The accuracy evaluation of interval prediction focuses on three aspects: the quality of the PI , the accuracy of the probabilistic prediction result, and the accuracy of the point prediction result [32,38,42]. (1) Prediction interval There are two important properties of prediction intervals: coverage probability and interval width, commonly evaluated by two metrics: the prediction interval coverage probability (PICP) and the normalized average width of the prediction interval (PINAW) [43]. A larger PICP and a smaller PINAW mean that more information is included in a smaller range of intervals, implying a superior performance of the prediction interval [44]. PICP reflects the probability that the predicted target value falls within the prediction interval L i , U i , defined as Eq. (7). (7) P I C P = 1 n ∑ i = 1 n ε i Where, ε i is Boolean variable, which represents whether the target value y i is within PI according to Eq. (8). PICP is expected to be equal to or higher than the confidence level. A larger PICP means that there will be more real data in predicted PI, and a low PICP indicates an unacceptable prediction result, as it does not reflect the true distribution. (8) ε i = 1 , y i ∈ L i , U i 0 , y i ∉ L i , U i However, as the PI increases, the PICP also increases. It is meaningless to focus only on higher PICP if the width of PI is ignored. Consequently, PINAW is used to limit the PI width, which is defined as Eq. (9). (9) PINAW = 1 n ( y max - y min ) ∑ i = 1 n U i - L i Where, y m a x and y m i n are the maximum and minimum values of the target value, respectively. (2) Probabilistic prediction The performance of the load quantile probabilistic prediction is commonly evaluated by the average pinball loss (APL) in Eq. (11) [42] which is proposed based on the pinball loss function defined by Eq. (10). (10) L τ , t y t , y ^ t τ = 1 - τ y ^ t τ - y t , y ^ t τ ≥ y t τ y ^ t τ - y t , y ^ t τ < y t (11) APL = 1 Γ T ∑ τ = 1 τ = Γ ∑ t = 1 t = T L τ , t y t , y ^ t τ Where, y ^ t τ denotes the evaluated τ t h quantile at time t and y t is the actual value at time t. APL is the average of the pinball loss function L τ , t for each quantile and each prediction point, and a lower value indicates a more accurate prediction. (3) Point prediction The predicted load with the highest probability density is chosen as the point prediction result of the model prediction, which is most likely to be near the actual load [32,38]. Three indicators are chosen to evaluate the performance of the point prediction, including the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), the variation coefficient of root mean square error (CV-RMSE), and the squared correlation coefficient (R2) [38]. MAPE is a model-independent metric; the smaller the MAPE, the closer the distance between the predicted and actual values. If the CV-RMSE is below 15 % the prediction model is considered accurate. R2 ranges from 0 to 1, the better the fit precision is if it is closer to 1. 2.2 Quantification of control strategy optimization issues 2.2.1 Issue 1: Robustness in load prediction under uncertainty The prediction results of the QRNN model can acquire the load probability distribution within PI, and the cumulative distribution of the load P ( X ≤ x ) . P ( X ≤ x ) denotes the sum of probability densities of all loads less than a certain load value, which can be used as the confidence level of the heat supply in the system control, given by Eq. (12). A larger heat supply of the control strategy has a higher confidence level to meet more volatile and uncertain heating demand conditions. (12) P ( X ≤ x ) = ∑ x k ≤ x p k Where, p k is the probability density function. ∑ x k ≤ x p k denotes the cumulative distribution function. After the control strategy with a specific confidence level of the heat supply is obtained by load distribution interval prediction, the load guarantee rate can be used to evaluate how well the heat supply of the strategy meets the actual load demand, which is calculated by the ratio of the duration when the heating capacity is equal to or higher than the actual demand to the total duration of occupied hours. It reflects the ability to meet the actual load demand in the face of load fluctuations under uncertainty. 2.2.2 Issue 2: Flexibility based on DR indoor temperature setting Energy flexibility is defined in IEA EBC Annex 67 [45] as \u201cEnergy Flexibility of a building is the ability to manage its demand and generation according to local climate conditions, user needs, and grid requirements.\u201d. The power demand at a certain time can be changed by the shiftable thermal load utilizing inherent BTM as the storage medium with little impact on occupant comfort or convenience [46]. And the flexibility characterizes the capacity of loads shifted from periods of peak electricity prices (also typically peak electricity usage) to off-peak periods to reduce peak energy consumption. Therefore, optimal DR control typically aims to maximize demand flexibility by minimizing electricity costs [47]. The peak load reduction capacity is defined as the flexibility potential, which is calculated by Eq. (13). (13) FlexibilityPotential = ∫ highpricestart highpriceend Q ̇ baseline - Q ̇ DR d t Where, Q ̇ DR is the heat supply under DR scenario, kW. Q ̇ baseline is the heat supply in the baseline scenario with no DR, kW. The operating cost and the cost-saving potential of the DR strategy are calculated in Eq. (14) and Eq. (15). (14) Total e l e c t r i c i t y c o s t = ∑ i = 1 i = 24 E total , i × J i = ∑ i = 1 i = 24 ( ∑ j = 1 N 1 E hp , j , i + ∑ k = 1 N 2 E pump , k , i ) × J i (15) Cost s a v i n g P o t e n t i a l = ∑ i = 1 i = 24 [ ( ∑ j = 1 N 1 E hp , b a s e l i n e , j , i - ∑ j = 1 N 1 E hp , j , i ) + ( ∑ k = 1 N 2 E pump , b a s e l i n e , k , i - ∑ k = 1 N 2 E pump , k , i ) ] × J i Here, J is the electricity price of TOU tariff, RMB/kWh. E t o t a l is the total energy power per hour of heat pumps E h p and circulation water pumps E p u m p , kWh, whose calculation is in Section 3.1. N 1 and N 2 present the number of units. E hp , b a s e l i n e and E pump , b a s e l i n e are corresponding equipment energy consumption in the baseline scenario. 2.3 Technical framework of dual-objective optimization and decision making In this paper, robust MPC is developed for the optimal control of building heating systems based on a load interval prediction model, which can enhance the operation stability of heating systems under uncertainty. Nevertheless, several studies have shown that robust solutions lead to more conservative outputs compared to deterministic MPCs, thus saving the system from worst-case risks [30]. At the same time, reducing the performance variability of the system in response to unknown and variable operating conditions can come at the cost of reduced flexibility potential [29]. Here, according to relevant studies [32,36], the point prediction results corresponding to the interval forecasts (i.e., the heating load profile consisting of the highest probability value in the hourly prediction interval) are considered the results of the point prediction model for deterministic MPC. Due to the discrepancy between the predicted results and the actual situation caused by uncertainty, optimal DR control of the deterministic MPC considering only minimizing operating costs may not be able to meet the actual load demand and thus fail to achieve the expected results [28]. The conflict between robustness and flexibility in the performance of control strategies for building energy systems needs to be resolved. In this part, a technical framework for dual-objective cooperated optimization integrating genetic algorithm and TOPSIS multi-objective decision method is presented to balance the robustness and flexibility of control strategies. The confidence level obtained from the QRNN model is taken as the robustness indicator Z 1 , and the energy flexibility of heating systems is represented by calculating the operating cost, which is taken as the other optimization indicator Z 2 to balance the conservativeness of the robustness. The dual-objective optimization problem is expressed in Eqs. (16), (17). The Pareto solution set is obtained by genetic algorithm, and then the final coordinated optimization solution is obtained by using TOPSIS dual-objective decision. (16) m i n Z 1 = - P ( X ≤ x ) Z 2 = ∑ i = 1 i = 24 E total , i × J i = ∑ i = 1 i = 24 ( ∑ j = 1 N 1 E hp , j , i + ∑ k = 1 N 2 E pump , k , i ) × J i Subject to: (17) 0 < P X ≤ x < 1 E h p = P h p ∙ t Q ̇ h p = P h p ∙ C O P 0.3 ∙ Q ̇ h p , m a x ≤ Q ̇ h p ≤ Q ̇ h p , m a x Where, P hp is the power of the heat pump, kW. t is working hours of the heat pump, h. Q ̇ hp , j , m a x p o w e r is the maximum heat supply of heat pump. 2.3.1 Optimization algorithm The classical methods for solving multi-objective optimization problems (e.g., weighting methods, ε-constrained methods) transform the multi-objective into a single-objective optimization [48]. Then conventional optimization methods such as gradient descent are used to solve the problem. However, the application of conventional optimization methods requires demanding data models and cannot solve complex optimization problems, like discontinuous, and highly nonlinear objective functions [49]. Evolutionary algorithms, on the other hand, have been successfully applied to solve conflicting multi-objective optimization problems by generating Pareto fronts (compromise solutions among different objectives) due to outstanding computational efficiency and robustness [50]. And the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA) is gradient-free and widely used in solving a variety of complex multi-objective optimization problems for actual energy systems [51,52]. Therefore, in this study, NSGA is chosen to find feasible solutions from dual-objective optimization. It should be noted that NSGA is not the best choice in terms of convergence time, but it offers a relatively better comprehensive Pareto Frontier. The non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm toolbox in MATLAB software is used to generate the Pareto front based on non-dominated solutions. Relevant parameters are set as follows: the initial population size is 50, the maximum number of iterations is 500, the crossover probability is 0.6 and the variance probability is 0.06. The input variables setting is introduced in Section 3.2.2. The optimization work was done on a computer with an Intel Core Intel(R) Core (TM) i7-8700H CPU @3.20 GHZ 3.19 GHZ with 16 GB RAM. The complete optimization process took about 902.7 s. The overall idea of optimization is as follows: the variables related to the indoor temperature setting under the demand response modulation rules are the input variables of the load prediction model (which can be nested into the bi-objective optimization algorithm) to obtain the corresponding load prediction intervals. From the load curve under a specific confidence level (robustness variable) within the intervals, the hourly energy consumption can be calculated using the equipment model. Then the operating electricity cost can be obtained using the time-of-use tariff. After that, the Pareto front can be generated by the genetic algorithm with the dual-objective optimization of the confidence level and the operating cost. 2.3.2 Entropy-weighted multi-objective decision-making method The TOPSIS performs a comprehensive evaluation of multi-objective indicators by ranking the evaluation object's proximity to the idealized object [53]. The final optimal control strategy is attained using TOPSIS with two optimization goals including confidence level and operating cost. To calculate the information entropy and indicator weight of different indicators, firstly the data of each indicator must be standardized. For different types of indicators, the standardization methods are different. If a larger value is better, the data standardization calculation formula is calculated as Eq. (18). Otherwise, Eq. (19) is applied. (18) Y ij = x ij - m i n ( X i ) max X i - m i n ( X i ) (19) Y ij = max X i - x ij max X i - m i n ( X i ) Where, X i is the i-th evaluation index, x ij is the jth data in the index X i , Y ij is the standardized result of data x ij , max X i and m i n ( X i ) is the maximum and minimum value of the index X i , respectively. The calculation formula of information entropy S i is: (20) S i = - l n ( m ) - 1 ∑ j = 1 m p ij l n p ij (21) p ij = Y ij ∑ j = 1 m Y ij Where m is the number of data points for an index. And if p ij = 0 , then lim p ij → 0 p ij l n p ij = 0 . After calculating the information entropy S i of different indicators, the weight of each indicator W i can be calculated: (22) W i = 1 - S i k - ∑ i = 1 k S i ( i = 1 , 2 , ⋯ k ) Through the weight and the standardized results of each data, the weighted standardized value z ij can be obtained by formula (20): (23) z ij = p ij W i The set of positive and negative ideal solutions are composed of the maximum value and the minimum value in the index, respectively. The set of positive and negative ideal solutions Z + and Z - can be determined as: (24) Z + = ( z 1 + , z 2 + , ⋯ , z j + , ⋯ , z m + ) (25) Z - = ( z 1 - , z 2 - , ⋯ , z j - , ⋯ , z m - ) The distance between each control strategy and the positive/negative ideal solution can respectively be determined as: (26) D i + = ∑ j = 1 m ( z ij - z j + ) 2 D i - = ∑ j = 1 m ( z ij - z j - ) 2 The control method closest to the ideal solution is the final adjustment strategy. The degree of closeness C i is defined as: (27) C i = D i - D i - + D i + 2.4 Optimization scenario setting To show the superiority of the proposed solution, strategies for different optimization objectives are made into three optimal scenarios: a robust optimal strategy (ROS) scenario, a flexible optimal strategy (FOS) scenario, and a robustness and flexibility coordinated optimal strategy (COS) scenario. And these three scenarios were compared with a baseline scenario, as shown in Table 1 . The baseline scenario is a deterministic control strategy that sets the indoor temperature to a fixed value (20 °C in this study) without implementing DR modulation. It is the common strategy of traditional thermostat-based controllers in industry [16], without any benefit from robustness and flexibility through MPC optimization and energy prices. The main aims to build the scenarios are: 1) demonstrate that the deterministic MPC is susceptible to uncertainty and may not satisfy the actual load demand as expected. 2) justify that the coordinated optimal control strategy weighs robustness and flexibility remarkably compared to other single-objective optimal control strategies. 2.5 Evaluation indicators for demand response flexibility Building energy flexibility contributes to making the power grid more reliable [54]. A detailed description of flexibility is essential to harness its potential at the planning and operational levels. 1. Storage efficiency When building thermal mass is used for load shifting, only a portion of the stored energy can be effectively utilized during the DR event due to the unavoidable heat loss of the building envelope. Storage efficiency η D R is defined as the proportion of the heat stored in BTM during the DR event that can be released into the room to reduce the heating load of the equipment to maintain thermal comfort, which is calculated in Eq. (28) [55]. (28) η D R = 1 - ∫ 0 ∞ Q ̇ heating , D R - Q ̇ heating , b a s e l i n e d t ∫ 0 l DR Q ̇ heating , D R - Q ̇ heating , b a s e l i n e d t Where, Q ̇ heating , D R is the heating load using DR strategies, kW, Q ̇ heating , b a s e l i n e is the heating load of the baseline scenario, kW. The integral in the denominator represents the available heat stored during the DR (e.g., preheating) duration l DR . The numerator represents the total difference of the DR-based heating profile minus the baseline-based heating profile during a one-day cycle (which should be the excess heat lost). 2. Flexibility factor Flexibility factor (FF) evaluates the capability to shift energy consumption from periods of high prices to periods of relatively low prices [47]. It\u2019s defined as: (29) FF = ∫ lowpricestart lowpriceend Q ̇ heating d t - ∫ highpricestart highpriceend Q ̇ heating d t ∫ lowpricestart lowpriceend Q ̇ heating d t + ∫ highpricestart highpriceend Q ̇ heating d t Where, Q ̇ heating is heat supply of the equipment over high and low-price periods. The flexibility factor varies between −1 and + 1. If the equipment consumes more heat at high tariffs, FF is approaching −1, implying a highly inflexible control system. On the contrary, if the equipment consumes more heat at low tariffs, FF is approaching 1, which indicates higher flexibility. 3 Case study 3.1 Case background An office building of a university in Tianjin, China, was selected as the case study. The total building area is 4973.4 m2, and it has four floors above ground with a height of 22.7 m. As a comprehensive office building, it has offices, research laboratories, and teaching rooms. The heating system in this building is turned on at 7:00 and off at 23:00. Ground source heat pumps with inverter compressors are adopted in the building as the heating source. Main equipment information is listed in Table 2 . According to the building thermal climate zoning in the current Chinese standard \u201cDesign standard for energy efficiency of public buildings\u201d (GB50189-2015), Tianjin corresponds to cold zone, with an average outdoor temperature in the coldest month (January) between −10 °C and 0 °C. The peak time of the TOU tariff in Tianjin is 8:00\u201311:00 and 18:00\u201323:00, the flat time is 7:00\u20138:00 and 11:00\u201318:00, and the valley time is 23:00\u20137:00. Building thermal mass has been proven to be a promising resource to function as efficient thermal storage in winter. However, the load shifting capability of building heating systems in winter has been much less studied compared to that in summer. Therefore, the case building in this study was investigated for building heating system control in heating season. During 2017.1.1\u20132017.1.20 and 2017.11.15\u20132018.2.1, the building's indoor temperature, meteorological parameters, number of occupants, and heating load were investigated in the case building. A total of 99 days of valid test data have been obtained. The time interval for data testing was 1 h. The measuring instruments used for data collection and their accuracy are presented in Table 3 . The energy-consuming equipment in this building was modeled using Eqs. (30)\u2013(34). And multiple units were controlled by sequential start/stop. 1. Model of Ground source heat pump The operation power P h p of heat pump can be calculated by the COP and the actual needed heat supply: (30) P hp = ∑ j = 1 j = N 1 Q ̇ ( j ) COP ( j ) (31) C O P j = α 1 + α 2 P L R j + α 3 PLR 2 j (32) P L R j = Q ̇ ( j ) Q ̇ rated ( j ) Where COP is the performance coefficient of the heat pump, PLR is partloadratio of the heat pump, and α is the fitting coefficient, which can be fitted by the least square method based on measured heating capacity, as listed in Table 4 . Q ̇ is the actual needed heat supply, kW, determined by the predicted heating load demand using QRNN prediction model. Q ̇ rated is the rated heating capacity, kW. 2. Model of circulating water pump The inlet and outlet temperatures of building heating system are considered constant. The pump model can be calculated as follows: (33) P pump = ∑ k = 1 k = N 2 P pump , r ( k ) ∙ γ ( k ) 3 (34) γ ( k ) = M ( k ) M r ( k ) Where P pump is the power of the pump, kW, M is its flow rate, m 3 / h , and r represents the rated condition. 3.2 DR control setting 3.2.1 Rules for modulating indoor temperature set-points Temperature set-points can sensitively increase or decrease the hourly heating load [30], which ultimately has a significant impact on the flexibility potential of energy systems. Hence, DR optimal control can be accomplished by modulating the temperature set-points at different times of a day using MPC. A day can be divided into four time periods according to occupancy and TOU tariff: unoccupied and off-peak, occupied and morning-peak, occupied and off-peak, and occupied and evening-peak, as shown in Fig. 3 . In winter, the normal indoor temperature of the baseline scenario without considering DR is set to 20℃ during occupied hours and floating during unoccupied hours. When performing DR temperature modulation, the definition of winter thermal comfort level II (that is 20 ± 2 °C) in Chinese standard GB50736-2012 [56] is used as the upper and lower temperature limits. It means that 20 ± 2 °C is considered as acceptable indoor temperature here in winter. The DR strategies adopted in this study are mainly divided into three basic schemes based on different electricity price peaks: preheating before morning peak (PBM), preheating before evening peak (PBE), and zone temperature reset (TR), as shown in Fig. 4 . Before two peaks, preheating strategies are applied, which are called PBM and PBE respectively. Preheating stores the imposed extra heat in BTM and releases it at peak tariff to help decrease electricity consumption. The preheating temperature of PBM is set to 18 °C for being in non-occupied time. The preheating temperature of PBE is adjusted upward and set to the upper limit of thermal comfort of 22 °C for being in occupied time. 3.2.2 Settings of the optimized parameters The settings of the input variable constraints for the optimization algorithm are shown in Table 5 , which is specified mainly according to the indoor temperature modulation rules for DR events in Section 3.2.1. There is one robustness variable, confidence level, ranging from 0 to 1. There are nine variables for the flexibility objective, including preheating period and different temperature reset strategies. The preheating period H b and H d varies from 2 to 5 h, and the temperature variation during TR ranges from 18 °C to 22 °C. The time step is set to 30 min. 4 Result and discussion 4.1 Load interval prediction accuracy In QRNN model, the measured data is divided into 70 % as training set and 30 % as prediction set for training and validation of the load prediction model. The typical day was selected considering the extreme case for further study and analysis. To demonstrate the reliability of load forecasting using the QRNN model, the results of the point and interval forecasts of the load were assessed respectively, as shown in Fig. 5 . The quality of the point prediction results was characterized by MAPE, CV-RMSE, and R2, as shown in Fig. 5(a). Based on actual load, the MAPE, CV-RMSE and R2 of the predicted heating load were 2.53 %, 3.45 % and 96.31 %, respectively, which indicate the high accuracy of the point prediction results. The average pinball loss of the probabilistic prediction was 0.1074, also indicating accurate performance. Fig. 5(b) visualizes the output of the load prediction interval. It can be seen that the overall profile trend of prediction interval and actual load are very similar, and the majority of actual loads fall within the interval, with only a few close to the boundary. This implies there is a fluctuating range of real load due to uncertainty, and extreme cases can be predicted using QRNN model. To further quantify the accuracy of the load prediction interval, PICP and PINAW were calculated at 50 %, 60 %, 70 %, 80 %, and 90 % confidence levels, as given in Table 6 . It can be seen that the coverage probability of the prediction interval to the actual loads increased with the increasing confidence level. The PICP reached 93.95 % under the confidence level of 90 %, indicating that the majority of the actual data in the prediction set are within the predicted interval. Meanwhile, the maximum value of PINAW was only 9.32 % under the confidence level of 90 %. The proposed load uncertainty prediction model has favorable interval coverage performance as well as fairly narrow interval widths under diverse confidence levels, implying the superior accuracy of the prediction interval. 4.2 Decision-making of optimal solution The coordinated optimization of building heating system control was conducted based on accurate and reliable prediction results in Section 4.1 and DR control setting rules in Section 3.2. To trade off the robustness and flexibility of the control strategy, the genetic algorithm was used for the dual-objective optimization of confidence level and operating cost, with a set of Pareto fronts, as shown in Fig. 6 . It can be seen that with the enhancement of the confidence level, the economic benefits from the flexible operation were significantly degraded as the operation cost rising from 66RMB to 792RMB. Especially when the confidence level exceeds 40 %, the growth of cost and confidence level is almost linear. Thus, weighing robustness and flexibility is necessary for control strategies of the building heating system. To select the best comprehensive solution among the non-dominated optimal solutions, the TOPSIS method was used for dual-objective decision-making. According to Eqs. (16)-(25), the weights of confidence level and operating cost were calculated to be 0.66 and 0.34, respectively. Positive ideal solutions were 0.0516 and 0.0315, respectively, and negative ideal solutions were both 0. The solution with 95 % confidence level and operating cost of 559.55RMB was the closest to the ideal solution, which was considered as the optimal solution. The corresponding optimal morning and evening peak preheating periods were 4 h and 3 h. And the temperatures from 18:00\u201323:00 were reset to 22 °C, 21.2 °C, 20.4 °C, 19.6 °C, 18.8 °C, and 18 °C, respectively. The indoor temperature set-points for the whole day are shown in Fig. 7 . It can be seen that during the occupied period (8:00 ∼ 23:00), the indoor temperature was kept within the thermal comfort temperature range. This can be attributed to the superior insulation of the building envelope, whereby the indoor temperature was almost equal to the setting values rather than deviating from it. 4.3 Evaluation of the proposed optimal strategy To investigate the significance of collaboratively considering forecast uncertainty and demand response flexibility, the performance of the coordinated optimal strategy was compared with other strategies established in Section 2.4. 4.3.1 Robustness analysis of control strategies The QRNN model was used to generate probability distribution interval results of heating load in form of quartiles. Fig. 8 shows the probability distribution of building heating load that labels the heating load of baseline scenario, ROS, and COS. It can be seen that due to the existence of uncertainty, there are three possible relationships between predicted heating load and actual demand: 1) the predicted load is less than the actual load (not satisfying actual demand); 2) the predicted load exceeds the actual load (satisfying actual demand); 3) the predicted value is almost equal to the actual required load value (satisfying actual demand). Only the baseline scenario cannot meet the actual load with the lowest confidence level (only 50 %). Its heating load was 9.6 % less than actual demand. The confidence level of ROS is 100 %, i.e., it can satisfy all possible load cases including the extreme values. However, there was a 7.4 % redundancy of heating load compared with the actual heating load, illustrating the conservative nature of the robust strategy. In contrast, COS did not impose redundant supply while satisfying actual load demand, still with a quite decent confidence level of 95 %. It\u2019s noted that the heating load of COS was located at the inflexion point of the cumulative probability density profile. On its left part, a slight decrease in heat supply would result in a significant deterioration in the confidence level of heat supply. On its right part, a major increment of heat supply has no significant improvement on the confidence level. Thereby, COS is verified as the most reasonable control strategy. Furthermore, the load profiles of a day corresponding to the different optimization strategies are given in Fig. 9 . Load guarantee rate is used to evaluate the ability of heat supply of different strategies to meet the actual load demand. Unsatisfied load quantity is the sum of the shortage of heating load when the heating capacity is insufficient. As can be seen, when heating systems operated with control signals of baseline scenario, there was a large amount of unsatisfied loads. The actual loads were not satisfied during 13:00\u201323:00, with a load guarantee rate of only 46.7 %. Baseline scenario can only achieve the expected effect if the actual load is equal to the predicted value without any uncertainties. However, the reality is often not ideal. The more the actual demand deviates from the predicted load, the more the control performance of deterministic MPC is jeopardized. Both ROS and COS outperformed baseline scenario in terms of load guarantee rate with 80 % and 100 %, respectively. Besides, the total unsatisfied loads of ROS, COS, and baseline scenario were 0 kW, 105.6 kW, and 224.6 kW, respectively. Although superior in meeting load demand, consistent with the results at 22:00, ROS was overly conservative compared to the actual load, with 14.1 % more than the total actual heating load, which can lead to significant energy waste if not constrained. It is worth noticing that compared with the baseline scenario, the unsatisfied load of COS was reduced by 53 %. And the degree of the conservativeness of COS was greatly reduced compared with ROS. This is attributed to the fact that the addition of the flexibility objective to the robust strategy formulation considerably lessens the conservativeness. 4.3.2 Flexibility analysis of control strategies Fig. 10 shows the DR control profiles of COS and the deterministic FOS. The pink area represents the heating load shifted from the peak periods to the off-peak periods. It can be seen that by implementing the DR strategies, peak loads at high tariff stages were significantly curtailed and shifted to off-peak at low tariff stages, which were 2061kWh (86 %) and 2137kWh (89 %) in COS and FOS, respectively. To further compare the flexibility potential of the different strategies, Fig. 11 shows the energy consumption and daily total operating cost of the case office building during peak, valley, and flat periods of TOU tariff. It can be seen that compared to the baseline scenario, the electricity usage of FOS and COS during peak periods was both reduced. The peak electricity consumption reductions were 302 kWh (65 %) and 289 kWh (62 %), and the corresponding overall electricity consumption was reduced by 151 kWh (17 %) and 76 kWh (8.5 %), respectively. That is, although the DR profiles in Fig. 10 demonstrate a significant increase in off-peak load, they do not increase total energy consumption. With TOU tariff and load shifting schemes, the operating costs of FOS and COS were reduced by 29.7 % and 24.3 %, respectively. That is, flexible DR control brings both energy-saving and cost-saving to the building heating system. The optimal energy flexibility was obtained by FOS. But inferior robustness of deterministic FOS, with only 46.7 %, means that heating loads are likely insufficient to satisfy the load demand. Compared to the FOS, the daily operating cost of COS increased by 39.96RMB, which only accounts for 0.05 %. Meanwhile, the load guarantee rate was improved from 46.7 % to 80 %. The increase in robustness can be attributed to higher heating capacity to cope with load variations. In addition, compared with ROS, COS decreased operating cost by 35.1 % from considerable peak power reduction, only sacrificing 20 % load guarantee rate. 4.4 Assessment of flexibility potential for demand response Preheating period and different temperature reset strategies probably have noticeable impacts on the flexibility potential when providing DR. The impacts were therefore investigated and the optimal DR strategies for morning peak and evening peak were also identified, as presented in Section 4.4.1. For analysis convenience, TR was classified into 5 types according to the characteristics of the temperature variation trail, as presented in Fig. 12 . Besides, two flexibility indicators were used to evaluate the DR flexibility, as presented in Section 4.4.2. Furthermore, to verify the superiority of the multiple-peak optimal control strategy obtained in Section 4.2, the flexibility was compared with that of single-peak optimal control in Section 4.4.3. 4.4.1 Flexibility potential The predicted heating profiles of PBM and PBE at different heating periods and different TR strategies are shown in Fig. 13 . It can be seen that peak load reduction was, in general, more influenced by PBM and TR. The reduction effect on PBE was relatively weak, compared with the baseline. And it is noted that the heating load of PBM had a slight rebound at 12:00, indicating that the energy stored in BTM during PBM has been fully discharged at this time. Stored heat includes heat losses and effectively utilized heat, and a detailed discussion of the storage efficiency is provided in Section 4.4.2. After 12:00, the heating load was recovered to be identical to that of the baseline scenario, which means the effect of PBM has been eliminated, and the evening peak would not be affected by PBM. Preheating has an obvious different effect on load shifting for morning peak and evening peak. Therefore, investigating different settings for different load peaks when developing DR strategies is critical to further improve flexibility potential. The peak energy consumption reduction, total power reduction, and operating cost reduction are shown in Fig. 14 . In Fig. 14(d), linear temperature reset was chosen in combination with PBE due to its prominent flexibility potential. It can be seen that overall, for the morning peak, the highest flexibility potential was reached by using PBM for 4 h, curtailing 70.6 % of the peak load compared with the baseline scenario. Although the total energy consumption increases, the operating electricity cost does not increase but decreases, owing to the load-shifting effect on equipment power changes over peak and valley hours. For evening peak, peak energy consumption was cut by 15 % at most using PBE only and up to 52.8 % using TR only. It is worth noting that the combination of linear TR and PBE for 3 h resulted in a 62.4 % peak load reduction, which is also quite an outstanding flexibility. Regarding economic benefits, the best operation cost reduction achieved by TR only was prominent, which was 152.5RMB, exceeding PBM and PBE by 237 % and 408 % respectively. PBE + TR further enhanced the cost-saving capability by 10.6 % compared to TR. It can be observed in detail that the flexibility potential obtained by preheating shows a certain law with the preheating period. The peak power reduction capacity increases with the preheating period and there exists an optimal period beyond which the reduction decreases instead. The optimal preheating period differs for the morning peak (4 h) and evening peak (3 h) for the case building. Specifically, TR was a major contributor to total energy consumption reduction during the evening peak, because TR reduced heating load requirements while ensuring thermal comfort by lowering the indoor temperature without additional electricity consumption of units. That also explains why the cost-saving for the evening peak is much more than the morning peak. The variation in electricity costs is a result of peak-cutting and valley-filling based on TOU tariffs, so the trend is consistent with the reduction of peak electricity use. 4.4.2 Flexibility evaluation Two metrics for different load shifting schemes are shown in Fig. 15 and Fig. 16 . The calculation of the storage efficiency was only for the preheating strategies, as TR did not involve energy storage process. From Fig. 15, in general, similar to the flexibility potential, there exists a preferred preheating period with the highest storage efficiency and flexibility factor. However, the storage efficiency results of PBM (up to 76.7 %) were lower than that of PBE (up to 97 %). This is in contrast to that peak load shifting capacity of PBR was much higher than that of PBE, which were up to 151.5 kW (71 %) and 45.8 kW (15.3 %), respectively. It can be found that storage efficiency cannot reflect the potential of DR to relieve peak electricity pressure on the grid and save operating costs for customers. From Fig. 16, the optimal combined PBE + TR (0.8) increased the flexibility factor by 50 % and 240 % compared to individual optimal TR (0.53) and PBE (0.23). Corresponding control strategies shifted more peak heating load to low demand periods, thus contributing more in relieving peak pressure on electricity consumption. But no general trend can be observed for the flexibility factor about the preheating period in PBE + TR, which is due to the very limited load that can be shifted from the high tariff period by PBE. 4.4.3 Comparison of flexibility potential for different electricity peaks The optimal flexibility potentials for morning peak and evening peak in Section 4.4.1 were compared with that of the optimal control for multiple peaks throughout the day in Section 4.2, as shown in Fig. 17 . It can be seen that, compared with the baseline scenario, the optimal DR control reduced peak electricity consumption and operating costs by 29.4 %, 36.2 %, 66.8 %, and by 8.5 %, 24.7 %, 32.4 % for morning peak, evening peak, and multiple peaks, respectively. The peak reduction capacity and the cost-saving capacity of multiple peaks are 37 %, 30 %, and 24 %, 8 % higher than that of the morning peak and evening peak, respectively. This declares that using appropriate DR schemes at multiple peaks of a day can alleviate the burden of peak electricity usage to a greater extent while achieving more economic benefits. From the above, it can be concluded that the proposed dual-objective cooperated optimal control strategy for building heating systems not only ensures stable control performance but also saves considerable operating costs through peak load shifting, which is a feasible solution to balance robustness and flexibility. Meanwhile, the best energy flexibility can be obtained by the optimal DR control strategy base on multiple peaks. It is also worth noticing that while we mainly investigated the application of the proposed approach to the heating season, it is also universal for the cooling conditions of air-conditioning systems. Since the adopted DR strategies rely on changing thermostat temperature set-points and no additional devices or controllers are required to invoke these strategies, they can be extended to the air conditioning equipment using smart thermostats. 5 Conclusion This paper proposed a dual-objective optimization approach to develop a coordinated optimal control strategy (COS) that balances robustness and flexibility for building heating systems with consideration of load uncertainty and demand response. By establishing a QRNN model to obtain load prediction interval, the confidence level corresponding to the heating load guides robust optimization. The economic benefit from load-shifting flexibility is used as the flexibility objective. And the flexibility potential of reducing multiple peak energy consumption was also evaluated. Main conclusions are as follows: (1) The COS can be determined by a trade-off between two objectives, i.e., maximum confidence level (robustness), and minimum operating cost (flexibility). In the case study, the trade-off results have been verified based on guaranteed hours of load demand and cost-saving potential. (2) The inclusion of robustness in DR optimal control effectively reduces the degree of load unsatisfaction. Peak heating loads were reduced by 89 % and 86 % in flexible optimal strategy (FOS) and COS, compared with the baseline scenario, respectively. However, the implementation of FOS would cause performance degradation for 53.3 % of the time, while the COS only had unguaranteed demands for 20 % of the time. (3) The proposed COS is effective in ensuring the satisfaction of the heating demand with steady operation in practice while maximizing the economic benefits of DR. Based on the baseline scenario, COS reduced 35 % more running costs than ROS with 80 % load guarantee rate and enhanced the robustness by 33.3 % with only 0.05 % cost sacrifice relative to FOS. (4) Comprehensively considering appropriate load shifting schemes for different electricity price peaks in a day can further maximize the flexibility benefits of energy systems. Peak energy usage reduction and cost-saving increase of the optimal DR control strategy for multiple peaks were 37 %, 30 % higher than that of morning peak, and 24 %, 8 % higher than that of night peak, respectively. The economic flexibility factor can be improved by combined load shifting schemes compared to single schemes, from 0.23/0.52 to 0.8. The proposed approach in this paper can effectively balance the robustness and flexibility of control strategy for heating systems. Only building thermal mass is considered as a load-shifting storage medium. Future research is recommended to investigate the participation of more efficient thermal storage devices using phase-change materials and renewable energy generation in dual-objective optimization of energy systems.

        "dc:description": "Robust strategies are essentially needed in building energy systems for meeting load demands stably under uncertainty, whereas demand response (DR) can serve the grid through flexible operation and achieve remarkable economic benefits. However, formulating optimal control strategies that enable weighing robustness and flexibility for energy systems is quite challenging and rarely addressed owing to their conflicting control objectives. In this paper, a dual-objective coordinated optimization approach is proposed and applied to the heating system of an office building equipped with heat pumps, to balance the robustness and flexibility of DR control under building load uncertainty. The load distribution interval is predicted by the quantile regression neural network model. And optimal DR strategies are performed via modulating indoor temperature set-points. Using the genetic algorithm and multi-objective decision-making optimization framework, the optimal strategy can be obtained by weighing the confidence level of load prediction interval and the operating cost of flexible operation. The results show that, compared with the robust optimal strategy, the coordinated optimal strategy reduces the operating cost by 35.8% with robustness that meets actual demands in 80% of the cases. Compared to the flexible optimal strategy, it sacrifices only 0.05% cost but increases the load guaranteed hours by 33.3%.",
