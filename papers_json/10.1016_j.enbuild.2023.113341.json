Instituto Dom Luiz Faculdade de Ciências Universidade de Lisboa 1749-016 Lisboa Portugal To stabilize the grid and reduce the need for grid level energy storage, due to the ongoing increased in the use of renewables for electricity production, building owners are incentivized to adjust their energy needs in demand response programs (DR). A common DR approach in service buildings is to temporarily turn off the HVAC system, triggering thermal inertia-based building electrical demand flexibility (TEF). TEF varies depending on internal loads and weather conditions. Currently the amount of TEF that can be provided to the grid is generally unknown to building managers and grid operators. This paper fills this gap by presenting a new soft sensor approach for estimation of TEF in cooling dominated service buildings. The proposed sensor was tested in three rooms with different thermal inertia and internal gains. The TEF potential was assessed in a typical modern office by simulating several DR events with different setpoint temperature variations, outdoor air temperatures and internal gains. Results show that the minimum duration of the HVAC off event (DHO) is 9 min for a 1.1 °C operative temperature increase, with typical durations of 15 to 60 min. The TEF values vary between 5Wh/m2 and 25Wh/m2. Keywords Energy flexibility Field measurements Thermal inertia Office buildings Soft sensor Data availability Data will be made available on request.

This goal requires maximum use of renewables for electrical energy generation. As a result, future electrical grids will need to handle variations in demand and production of electricity in real-time through, among other things, demand response programs (DR). DR occurs when a building provides load flexibility by increasing, or decreasing its electricity consumption, at the requests of utilities [1]. Part of this flexibility will be provided by voluntary consumer participation DR programs that incentivize reduced electricity usage in periods of high grid demand. Typical building control actions triggered during these voluntary DR events include turning off lights [2], appliances [3] and adjusting setpoints of heating ventilation and air conditioning systems (HVAC) [4,5]. In DR programs consumers are compensated by utilities with a reduction in monthly electricity costs. To limit consumer impact, DR events are optimized by utilities to be as short as possible, typically lasting up to two hours. In service buildings with high space cooling demand a commonly used DR approach is to turn off electrically powered HVAC systems [6,7,8], thereby reducing the building electrical demand. In these cases, the capability of a given room to maintain acceptable indoor conditions depends on the combined effect of thermal loads and space thermal inertia. Thermal inertia-based building electrical demand flexibility (TEF) of cooling dominated buildings is measured by the capability of a given building to eliminate HVAC related electrical energy demand through storage of sensible heat gains in exposed internal thermal mass. This type of electrical load flexibility is relevant to service buildings that predominantly require cooling. Once the HVAC is turned off, rooms with a high thermal inertia and low sensible cooling load will have a slower indoor temperature increase [9]. In contrast, rooms with low thermal inertia and high sensible loads will experience a rapid increase in air temperature, thereby limiting the capability for DR without compromising thermal comfort. The overall TEF that a building or a part of a building can offer to a grid operator in a DR event changes continuously throughout the day due to variations in thermal load and weather conditions [10]. Currently the amount of TEF that can be provided to the grid is unknown to users, building managers and grid operators. To increase the use of TEF as a smart grid energy resource there is a need for a sensor that continuously estimates the available TEF for a given building. To address this challenge, this paper presents a sensor for continuous automated measurement of available TEF. The measurement of TEF requires a combination of physical sensors with an algorithm, an approach known as soft sensor [11]. Soft sensors integrate data from multiple sources to create new measurement possibilities, enabling real-time prediction of parameters that cannot be directly measured. Soft sensors have been successfully applied in various industries, in equipment fault detection and in several areas of environmental monitoring [12]. In modern industrial processes, soft sensors are used to predict equipment failures, detect process anomalies, and optimize production [12]. So far, the use of soft sensors in the building sector has been limited to optimization of energy systems and fault detection [13] of hydraulic pumps [14], heat pumps [15], air handling units (AHU) [16] and district heating systems (DH) [17]. The research presented in this paper fills an existing research gap by presenting a new soft sensor approach for estimation of TEF in real time [18] in cooling dominated buildings. The accuracy of the proposed soft sensor was tested in measurements in three different rooms in two buildings with different levels of thermal inertia and internal gains. This paper is divided into four sections. Section two describes the methodology used to develop and test the soft sensor. Section three presents the results of the sensor accuracy tests. Section four presents the conclusions of this study. 2 Methodology This section begins with a description of the soft sensor algorithm and architecture followed by the experimental setup used to test the soft sensor. This section concludes with a presentation of the methodology used in the assessment of TEF potential in several deployment scenarios. 2.1 Soft sensor algorithm DR programs are typically quantified in terms of load reduction or increase, stored energy, storage efficiency, and storage time response [19,20]. To meet the requirements of grid operators and users the proposed soft sensor must be able to continuously measure the total available energy flexibility (TEF) as well the duration of the reduced electrical demand period. TEF is quantified in kWh per square meter of room or floor or building area. The duration of the event is quantified in hours (or more typically fractions of hours). The approach used in this soft sensor can be illustrated by considering a single room served by an HVAC system that will be turned off during the DR event. In this example the average available electrical power reduction (APR) that a building can offer to the grid during the DR event is equal to the energy consumption of the HVAC system that will be turned off. Therefore, the parameter that needs to be calculated by the soft sensor is the duration of the HVAC off event (DHO). In cooling dominated buildings, once the HVAC system is turned off, indoor temperature increases, eventually reaching a level that compromises occupant comfort, dictating the end of the DR event and the value of DHO. As shown in Equation (1), the three soft sensor variables have a simple relation: (1) TEF ( k W h / m 2 ) = A P R ( k W / m 2 ) × D H O ( h ) The soft sensor uses the thermal inertia of the room to store sensible heat gains, delaying the temperature increase. The equations that describe heat conservation in a room are non-linear and do not have an analytical solution. To tackle this challenge the soft sensor will model the room thermal response using a lumped capacitance RC model that continuously predicts the room air temperature in the next hour in a virtual scenario of HVAC off. This continuous simulation process constantly predicts DHO and TEF using an APR that can be obtained from the HVAC system. The RC model must be calibrated for each room in the building where the soft sensor will be used. For this calibration the HVAC system must be turned off once, during a suitable time that allows for a 2 °C temperature increase in the space. Table 1 describes all the variables and parameters used by this soft sensor, including input variables such as outdoor and indoor air temperature and the total heat load of the space. The input variables of the soft sensor are the outdoor and indoor air temperature and the total heat load of the space, including plug loads, lighting, occupants, and thermal and solar gains from the envelope. Traditional sensors and meters measure outdoor and indoor air temperature and electrical loads from plugs and lighting. The total space sensible load (SL) is obtained from the electrical demand of the HVAC system (APR) and the overall HVAC system efficiency for sensible cooling (EH) using: (2) SL ( W / m 2 ) = APR ( k W / m 2 ) × A r e a 1000 × E H APR is directly measurable or inferable from building data. EH is obtainable from the ratio between the sensible cooling power provided to the room and APR by rearranging Equation (2). In the more common case where the HVAC system serves several rooms the value of APR needs to be inferred from previous events when the HVAC was turned off in each room or, when available, from partial measurements in branches of the HVAC system that serve each room. This scenario requires a separate soft sensor approach for APR and will not be discussed in this paper. Fig. 1 illustrates the process of calibrating the RC model to predict DHO. After one initial RC model calibration, the soft sensor can calculate the DHO for various operating conditions in real-time for variable SL and outdoor temperature. Therefore, the algorithm of the proposed soft sensor follows the following three steps: 1. Measure the room air temperature. 2. Calibrate the RC model. 3. Continuously calculate available TEF for variable space and outdoor conditions. The calibration of the proposed soft sensor was based on measurements in three different rooms, where all parameters shown in Table 1 are known. Two test cells with different thermal inertia, three levels of furniture mass and three internal gains and a large open plan office. The experiments measured indoor air temperature, outdoor air temperature and internal heat gains. This approach assesses the capability of the sensor to identify the characteristics of the space (thermal inertia and indoor-outdoor heat loss). In addition, by running tests with variable outdoor conditions and SL it is possible to validate the capability of the RC model to accurately predict room temperature for these variable conditions. This is done by running an RC model validated with 60 W/m2 sensible gains in scenarios with 40 and 80 W/m2 gains. The validation was done in the two TCs. 2.2 RC model There are several approaches that can be used to model room thermal inertia in a soft sensor [21]. Most simulation-based energy flexibility studies found in the literature use either dynamic simulation tools [22,23,24,25,26] or simplified grey\u2013box models [27,28,29,30]. These hybrid models combine the strengths of white\u2013box and black\u2013box models [31], providing a balanced compromise between simplicity and accuracy [32] while relying in model parameters with physical meaning [33]. A common type of grey-box approach used in building analysis is the Resistance\u2013Capacitance (RC) model [34]. RC models represent the thermal behavior of a building as an electrical circuit. The number of capacitances used to group the thermal mass of the building determines the order of the RC model. Reduced\u2013order RC models have been shown to be more versatile and applicable to different building types [35]. However, first\u2013order models that group all building elements into a single capacitance have been shown to need to be more accurate for short\u2013duration forecasts [36]. Second\u2013order models are more accurate than first-order models, making them a more reliable option for predicting the thermal behavior of buildings [37]. The soft sensor presented in this paper uses a 2R2C Grey\u2013model approach that is easy to implement and less susceptible to overfitting than higher order RC models. The 2R2C model can be accurate in short-term temperature forecasting, such as daily forecasts [38]. Its effectiveness can be attributed to its ability to capture the key thermal properties of a building, including the resistance to heat flow through the building envelope (R\u2013values) and the thermal capacity of the building (C\u2013values, see Fig. 2 ). The model uses two capacitances, effectively differentiating between the thermal capacity of the structural mass and the internal thermal mass (that also includes the effective heat capacity of the air). The model has four unknowns that are obtained in the model calibration phase (the single HVAC off event discussed above). A similar model has already been used by the authors in a previous experimental study on TEF in residential buildings [38]. This model considers that internal sensible heat gains, Qint (in W), are directly inserted into the indoor air temperature node. To represents the outdoor temperature and Tm the mass temperature. To facilitate comparison, the parameters are normalized to the floor area unit (Af). The overall performance of the test rooms is influenced by the combined effect of the thermal inertia of the furniture mass and the structural mass. In this study, the short-term effective heat capacity (Cf/Af) and the long-term effective heat capacity (Cm/Af) were identified as the most relevant parameters. These parameters represent the effective heat capacity of the internal thermal mass and the structural thermal mass respectively. The parameters that physically characterize the room are: ­ Cf (J K−1 m−2), the furniture effective heat capacity that lumps the thermal response of office furniture, internal partitions, and the room air mass. ­ Cm (J K−1 m−2), the test-cell effective heat capacity that lumps indoor exposed surfaces such as walls, ceilings, and floors. ­ Ro (K m2 W−1), the indoor-outdoor thermal resistance through the envelope. ­ Rm (K m2 W−1), the thermal resistance between mass and room air, i.e., an air-to-surface convective resistance. For their identification, mathematical relationships between the parameters are established, performing a static analysis of the heat transfer in the area under study. Knowing To, Qint and all thermal capacitances and resistances, the two unknown temperature nodes (Tm and Tr) are calculated by solving the following differential equations. (3) C f d T r dt = Q int + Q hvac + T o - T r R o + T m - T r R m C m d T m dt = T r - T m R m Defining an equivalent resistance as Req = Rm Ro/ (Rm + Ro) and considering that Qhvac = 0 during the experiments (HVAC off), equations (3) and (4) can be rewritten as: (5) R eq C f d T r dt = R o R m ∗ Q int + R m ∗ T o - T r + R o ∗ T m - T r (6) R m C m d T m dt = T r - T m with the following dimensionless thermal resistances R m ∗ = R m / R m + R o and R o ∗ = R o / R m + R o . Note that R m ∗ = 1 - R o ∗ and, therefore, the equations that will be solved numerically are (7) τ f d T r dt = R o 1 - R o ∗ Q int + 1 - R o ∗ T o - T r + R o ∗ T m - T r (8) τ m d T m dt = T r - T m and have four RC parameters: τ f = R eq C f , τ m = R m C m , R o and R o ∗ . A Cranck-Nicholson scheme is used to solve the equations, formulated as follows (9) τ f Δ t + 1 2 T r t + 1 - R o ∗ 2 T m t + 1 = τ f Δ t - 1 2 T r t + R o ∗ 2 T m t + R 0 1 - R o ∗ Q int t + 1 - R o ∗ T o t (10) - 1 2 T r t + 1 + τ m Δ t + 1 2 T m t + 1 = 1 2 T r t + τ m Δ t - 1 2 T m t The matrix form of equations is (11) Θ t + 1 = A - 1 B Θ t + A - 1 S t (12) Θ = T r T m (13) A = τ f ∗ + 0.5 - 0.5 R o ∗ - 0.5 τ m ∗ + 0.5 (14) B = τ f ∗ - 0.5 0.5 R o ∗ 0.5 τ m ∗ - 0.5 (15) Θ = R o 1 - R o ∗ Q int + 1 - R o ∗ T o 0 where τ f ∗ = τ f / Δ t and τ m ∗ = τ m / Δ t are the dimensionless time constants. RC models can be calibrated using forward or inverse approaches [39]. The 2R2C model used in the soft sensors relies on an inverse modelling approach to identify the parameters that minimize the error between model predictions and measured air temperature increase in an HVAC off event. This process requires a global optimization algorithm, such as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) or Genetic Algorithms (GA). Several studies show that PSO is one of the most accurate optimization algorithms for RC model calibration [40]. The PSO algorithm is a heuristic optimization algorithm that begins by initializing a group of particles at random positions within the search space. Each particle is assigned a velocity, which determines the direction and magnitude of its motion. The fitness of each particle is evaluated using a defined minimization function. Based on this evaluation, the algorithm updates the position and velocity of each particle. This iterative process continues until the algorithm reaches a predetermined stopping criterion, such as a maximum number of iterations or a satisfactory optimization level. The main advantage of using PSO for RC model calibration is its ability to effectively search for the global optimum in a large parameter space. A recent study that compared the performance of four optimization algorithms, namely PSO, GA, simulated annealing (SA), and differential evolution (DE) algorithm, found that PSO had the highest accuracy in identifying the RC model parameters [41]. Using a PSO approach, the RC model parameters were identified by minimizing the root mean square error (RMSE), defined as the square root of the average of the squared differences between the measured and predicted air temperature values. (16) RMSE = ∑ i = 1 N T r ^ i - T r i 2 N with T r ^ and T r the measured and the computed room air temperatures, respectively, for each time-step i and N the total number of time-steps. 2.3 Test rooms The measurements were carried out in two test cells (TC) and a large open plan modern office in the Seixal (SO). The two TC are located on the east wing of the fourth floor of building C1 of the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon, in Lisbon, Portugal (built in 1985, Fig. 3 ). The two TCs have different thermal inertia. The TC with high thermal inertia has low indoor-outdoor insulation, high exposed internal mass, a floor area of 21 m2 and a floor to ceiling height of 3.38 m. The TC with light inertia has internally insulated walls (10 cm of extruded polystyrene XPS) and 15 cm of internal XPS in the ceiling and floor slabs. The test cells differ not only in terms of thermal inertia but also in terms of thermal insulation. The TC has a floor area of 37.5 m2 and a height of 3.05 m (lower due to the internal insulation layers). A layer of double aluminium foil with an enclosed air gap of 0.5 cm was added to the outdoor glazing face on the windows of each TC to completely block solar radiation and increase the insulation of the glazing. The SO building houses the Seixal Municipality and is located in the Tagus estuary, about 15 km from the center of Lisbon. This modern office building has a floor area of 15,000 m2 and consists of two three-story blocks intended to use as work offices and open space offices, connected by a central circulation atrium. The measurements were performed in a large open space 341 m2 on the first floor of the south block. This area is an excellent representation of the overall design and functionality of the building. The building fabric for the three test rooms is described in Table A1. Adding furniture mass to a room increases the room thermal inertia, directly, and indirectly by increasing the area where air to solid heat exchange by convection occurs [21,42]. However, several factors, including the size and layout of the room and the materials used in the construction of the furniture, will influence the effect of furniture mass on the thermal inertia of the room. To evaluate the influence of furniture mass on overall room thermal inertia and test the capability of the RC model to capture this effect, test were performed with different levels of furniture mass in the test cells. The use of different levels of furniture mass allows for the coverage of a wide range of realistic conditions in office buildings. Table 2 shows the characteristics of the materials that make up the internal mass used in each measurement in the TCs. Table 3 shows the mass of all the objects present in the SO open space during the measurements. The active mass of five concrete pillars that are exposed in the open space, each with a surface area of 7.6 m2, was calculated using a 2 cm active thickness, as defined by EN 13790 [43]. In the experimental campaign carried out in the TCs, three levels of internal sensible heat gains (40 W/m2, 60 W/m2, and 80 W/m2) were used for each level of furniture. The sources used were metal cylinders with a light bulb inside, simulating sensible heat gains from occupants, by the equipment and by the lighting. Five cylinders plumes were used in the heavy thermal inertia test-cell (HT), and ten cylinders plumes were used in the light thermal inertia test-cell (LT) to provide similar heat dispersion between the two TCs. Fig. 4 A illustrates the combinations between the various levels of furniture mass and internal gains used in the experimental campaign. The experimental campaign in the TCs was conducted at night to avoid effects from solar gains. The measurements in the SO room were performed during normal use of the space and all internal sensible heat load were measured apart from solar gains that will be discussed below (Fig. 4B). The SO measurements were performed in the morning with the internal blinds down. Still there are some solar sensible gains into the space that were calculated using an EnergyPlus model, calibrated with data from the SO experimental campaign [44]. The sensible heat gains and weather data used in these simulations were measured on site (data shown in Fig. 4B and data from a local weather station). The simulation outputs used to calculate the solar gains were the 'Windows Total Transmitted Solar Radiation Rate' and the 'Windows Total Transmitted Diffuse Solar Radiation Rate'. 2.4 Measurement setup In the experimental campaign carried out in the TCs, eighteen controlled experiments were conducted. Each experiment begun with a stabilization phase that maintained a constant air temperature with stable internal gains and cooling system. The temperature in the LT stabilized at 20 °C, while the HT stabilized at 21 °C. During the TEF event phase, the cooling system was turned off, and the internal gains remained constant, causing the air temperature to rise. In each experiment, the indoor air temperature was measured every minute, using ten sensors in the LT and six sensors in the HT, located in different parts and heights. The SO measurements were done on 20 November 2017 and started at 9:48 am with a duration of 128 min. In this experimental campaign, nine sensors were used in different locations to measure the indoor air temperature, humidity, and CO2 every minute. In all rooms, infiltration was measured by CO2 decay. In SO, the infiltration of the open space was measured at night on 17 November 2017, when the space was unoccupied, and the HVAC system was switched off after a working day. In the experimental campaign at the TCs, the CO2 was injected in the middle of the room and measured on 3 April 2023. The result of the infiltration measurement in the three tested rooms was 0.2 ACH. The specifications of the sensors used are shown in Table 4 . An existing weather station at the FCUL campus measured the outdoor air temperature. The identification for the different experiments combines the three variables under study (structural thermal mass, furniture thermal mass, and internal gains). HT and LT represent the test cells with heavy and light thermal inertia, respectively. F12.5, F25 and F37.5 are the different levels of furniture mass and G40, G60 and G80 for the different internal gains. For example, HT-F12.5-G60 represents the experiment performed on the HT, with 12.5 kg/m2 of furniture mass (F12.5) and 60 W/m2 of internal gains (G60). Table 5 summarises the measurements taken and the conditions under which each experiment was carried out. 2.5 TEF soft sensor deployment scenarios With the goal of understanding the TEF that a typical office building can provide for a typical range of outdoor and indoor conditions, the soft sensor that was calibrated using the HVAC off event shown in Fig. 4B (Seixal open space). The RC model that was calibrated in this event was then used to deploy the soft sensor in a range of typical internal gains and outdoor temperatures. Several existing studies indicate that TEF is highly dependent on both outdoor temperature [45] and total heat gains [46]. The sensor was tested for outdoor temperatures, ranging from 10 °C to 30 °C and three levels of internal sensible heat gains (25, 50 and 75 W/m2). The range of internal gains was based on a large survey of office buildings that found a mean value of 47.9 W/m2 and a standard deviation of 11.6 W/m2 [47]. The internal heat gains introduced in these deployment scenarios do not consider solar gains, which can also have a significant impact on the building's thermal behavior. An analysis of the impact of solar gains and other factors will be performed in a future study that will use data from sensor deployment in several office buildings. APR is a function of the space cooling load and efficiency of the HVAC system. In this deployment exercise the space sensible cooling load was predicted by the RC model [48]. Using this prediction, APR was calculated assuming that the HVAC system consisted of a heat pump and a variable air volume all air system with a constant fan power demand of 10 W/m2 [49]. In this analysis. The heat pump COP was calculated using Carnot's COP multiplied by a typical efficiency of an air-to-water heat pump (ψt, Equation (17), proposed by [50]: (17) CO P Cooling = ψ t × T Evaporator T Condenser - T Evaporator , T Condenser = T out + 5 ° C a n d T Evaporator = 0 ° C The average measured efficiency of a typical heat pump is approximately 40% [50]. This approach allows for a prediction of heat pump COP that reflects the impact of outdoor air temperature on the heat pump condenser temperature. In each scenario APR was calculated using Equation (2). Finally, in each case, TEF is calculated using equation (1). DHO depends on the thermal response of the space and occupant comfort constraints. According to EN 15251 [51], offices are category II buildings where occupants have \u201cnormal expectations\u201d. For summer conditions, and summer clothing (0.5 met), the operative temperature for category II should be in the range of 23\u201326 °C. Thus, for this analysis, the reference temperature (starting point) for air and surfaces will be 23 °C. The acceptable drifts/ramps in indoor operative temperature shown in Table 6 (ASHRAE Standard 55\u20132017 [52]). 3 Results This section begins with the experimental results and proceeds by presenting the model RC parameters obtained in each sensor calibration scenario. The final part of this section shows the soft-sensor operation scenarios for a typical office building. 3.1 Measured DHO The maximum DHO used in the measurements allowed for a space air temperature increase of 4.0 °C. Exploratory RC model calibration runs showed that the precision of the model decreases when the temperature rise used in the calibration is less than 2.0 °C. As a result, all RC model calibrations were performed using a space air temperature increase of 2.0 °C. The results of the measured average internal air temperature during HVAC off events in the nineteen measurements performed in three different rooms are shown on the left side of Fig. 5 . This data was used to calibrate nineteen versions of the soft sensor that were used to predict the APR and TEFs shown in the center and right columns. As shown in Table 5, the average outdoor temperature during these measurements was 20.15 °C with a sigma of ± 0.82 °C. The variations in average outdoor temperature between different tests introduce errors in most comparisons between different tests. 3.1.1 Analysis The experimental results shown in the left column of Fig. 5 reveal that measured DHO increases with room thermal inertia and decreases with room internal sensible gains. Additionally, for a given room, DHO increases with furniture mass. For the 40 W/m2 measurement scenario DHO varied between 8 and 12 min for the LT room and 31\u201355 min for the HT room. As the heat gains increase DHO decreases to around 4 min (LT) and 15 min (HT). The average outdoor temperature in the measurements was 12.5 °C. Nine of the nineteen measurements were performed with an outdoor temperature that is within 1 °C of the average, resulting in a negligible impact of this parameter when comparing different measurements. Possible impacts from outdoor temperature in the cases with higher deviations from the average (up to 4 °C) are restricted to the HT room since the LT room has a low indoor to outdoor thermal conductivity. Still, analysis of the results indicate that these impacts are minimal but can be noticed: in the case HT-F37.5 with 80 W/m2 we see a small reduction in DHO because of lower heat losses to the warmer outside environment. The middle and right-side columns in Fig. 5 show the outputs of the soft sensor for each experimental case. For the same internal gains, the predicted APR values for the HT room are higher than the LT room due to the higher envelope heat losses (higher indoor outdoor thermal conductance and higher losses to adjacent rooms). Still, as expected, the calculated APR values are very similar with the main differences between cases resulting from the variations of sensible heat gains: in steady state, the starting point of all measurements, higher gains lead to higher APR values. The TEF values show a marked difference between rooms: the value for the heavy room is three to four times larger than the light room. In each case this large difference is due to higher DHO values. While APR varies between 15\u201325 W/m2 the TEF values that can be delivered to the grid vary between 2 and 10Wh/m2. Buildings composed of rooms with high thermal inertia can provide the same reduction in electrical demand as light buildings, the difference is the duration of this reduction that can be up to four times larger. 3.2 Soft-sensor calibration The output of the PSO algorithm RC fitting process is a set of four independent model parameters that minimize the RMSE between measured data and model predictions. Table 7 presents the results of the fitting process that results in the soft sensor calibration for the nineteen experiments. The indoor-outdoor thermal resistance includes the combined effects of heat loss due to conduction, convection and air infiltration through the building envelope. As shown in Fig. 6 A, the average indoor-outdoor thermal resistance is 0.2 W K−1 m−2 and 4.8 W K−1 m−2 in the LT and HT, respectively. The high values observed in the HT can be attributed to poor thermal insulation since the measured outdoor air infiltration is similar in the two rooms (∼0.2 ACH). The overall performance of the test cells is influenced by the combined effect of the thermal inertia resulting from the furniture mass and the structural mass. In this study, the short-term effective heat capacity (Cf/Af) and the long-term effective heat capacity (Cm/Af) were identified as the most relevant parameters. These parameters represent the effective heat capacity of the internal thermal mass (Fig. 6B) and the structural thermal mass (Fig. 6C), respectively. Fig. 6D shows the results of these two parameters and their sum (CT/Af), which represents the total thermal inertia of the space. Table 8 shows a summary of the RC model parameters obtained and these were compared with the values calculated using the simplified hourly method presented in EN ISO 13790. 3.2.1 Analysis The clear distinction between the two test cells suggests that the developed method can accurately capture the indoor-outdoor thermal resistance. The SO room exhibits an intermediate value of 1.1 W K−1 m−2 for this parameter despite the building's good thermal insulation. This variation can be attributed to the large glazed envelope area in the SO. The short-term effective heat capacity increases with furniture mass in HT. This parameter includes the air and furniture mass heat capacities. The ISO 52016 standard [53] suggests a reference value of 10 kJ K−1 m−2 for 25 kg m−2 of furniture mass. The values for LT and HT are slightly higher than the reference (11 kJ K−1 m−2 and 14.1 kJ K−1 m−2 respectively), with a smaller difference for LT. For HT, only HT-F25-G40 matches the reference value, while HT-F25-G60 and HT-F25-G80 are higher by up to 50%. As expected, the specific heat capacity (Cm/Af) of HT materials is an order of magnitude higher than that of LT materials. According to ISO 13790 [43], the average Cm/Af values indicate very low thermal inertia for LT materials (80 kJ K−1 m−2) and medium thermal inertia for HT materials (165 kJ K−1 m−2). The SO's long-term effective heat capacity (Cm/Af) is similar to the LT's value, indicating low thermal inertia as per ISO 13790 [43]. This is consistent with the building's suspended ceiling and raised floor, which reduce the effective thermal capacity of the structure. 3.3 Soft sensor validation This section presents the validation of the developed soft sensor and evaluates its accuracy. This validation process consisted of calibrating the soft sensor using the measurement with intermediate internal gain (60 W/m2) and 12.5 kg/m2 furniture mass in both TCs. Parameters extracted from this calibration process were later used to predict temperature increases in low internal gain (40 W/m2) and high internal gain (80 W/m2) scenarios for both TCs. The accuracy of the model predictions was evaluated by comparing them with the corresponding measurements for the low and high internal gain scenarios in both test cells. The RMSE was chosen as the metric to evaluate the prediction errors, providing a quantitative assessment of the model performance. Fig. 7 shows the comparison between the measured and predicted air temperature for both TCs, with the first line showing the validation process of the soft sensor using measurements taken at the LT and the second line showing the validation process using measurements taken at the HT. In low air velocity environments, the operative temperature is equal to the average between the air temperature and the radiant temperature. Using this principle, the performance of the soft sensor in predicting the operative temperature was evaluated using data from an experimental campaign carried out in the Seixal Town Hall office building. Fig. 8 shows the calibration process of the soft sensor using data collected during an experimental campaign carried out in the Seixal Town Hall office building, which provides an essential insight into the effectiveness of the method in real-world environments. The results showed that the RMSE of soft-sensor predictions for the operative temperature predictions is less than 0.6 °C. The simulations assume that the initial temperature of the thermal mass is equal to the air temperature. This explains the difference shown in the figure between the predicted and measured values during the initial time steps. 3.3.1 Analysis Fig. 7 shows a good match between simulations and experiments. The RMSEs of the predictions were 0.11 °C and 0.16 °C for LT with low (40 W/m2) and high (80 W/m2) internal gains, respectively. For HT, the RMSEs were 0.23 °C and 0.04 °C for low and high internal gains, respectively. The soft sensor underpredicts the temperature rise for low internal gains and overpredicts it for high internal gains. However, the soft sensor performs well, with RMSEs below 0.30 °C for all scenarios. The validation results confirm the soft sensor's effectiveness. It can accurately predict the internal temperature increase under different internal gain scenarios, with acceptable errors. The ability to accurately calculate the operative temperature using only the indoor air temperature in lower air velocity environments can be beneficial in situations where it may be difficult or impractical to measure the average radiant temperature directly. While air temperature is important in understanding the thermal conditions of space, it provides an incomplete picture of thermal comfort. Operative temperature, which considers both air temperature and average radiant temperature, is a better indicator of the actual thermal conditions experienced by occupants. 3.4 Thermal inertia-based building energy flexibility potential This section presents the results of the assessment of the TEF potential for a standard open space office with raised floor and suspended ceiling. The parameters obtained from the data of the SO were used to calibrate the sensor used in these simulations. Soft sensor RC model runs were performed for different weather conditions and sensible heat gains. The maximum allowed setpoint temperature variation is a key parameter that significantly affects the DHO. In these simulations this parameter was set according to the values presented in Table 7. The results of the analysis are presented in Fig. 9 . Fig. 9 uses three colors to indicate the DHO values in relation to the ASHRAE Standard 55\u20132017 thresholds shown in Table 6. Green indicates that the DHO is within the acceptable range, yellow indicates that the DHO is between 50% and 100% of the threshold, and red indicates that the DHO is below 50% of the threshold. The yellow color reflects the subjective nature of this parameter and occupant perception, while the red color warns against conducting TEF events under these conditions. 3.4.1 Analysis The simulation results presented in Fig. 9 show that the TEF in office buildings varies between 4.7 and 12.0Wh/m2 (ΔT of 1.1 °C), reaching up to 25.2Wh/m2 for a ΔT of 2.2 °C in offices with low internal gains. For summertime outdoor conditions (25°, 30°), TEF is not significantly affected by internal gains, as the decrease in DHO is compensated by an increase in APR. However, the DHO reduction is more significant when comparing the 25 W/m2 and 50 W/m2 categories, as opposed to the 50 W/m2 and 75 W/m2 categories and the same is also verified in the TEF indicator (as shown in Fig. 9). DHO is inversely proportional to the internal gains. Typical DHO ranges are between 15 and 60 min, reaching 115 min for offices with low internal gains [8,44,54]. These simulation results also show that buildings with low internal gains have the potential to offer TEF over a wider range of outdoor temperatures, while meeting the minimum requirements for the duration of the indoor air temperature rise. This highlights the importance of using energy efficient lighting and equipment with low heat dissipation rates. The maximum allowed temperature increase during a TEF event is a subjective parameter that depends on building occupant tolerance that varies on a daily and seasonal basis [55]. As a result, the limits imposed by ASHRAE 55\u20132017 may be too restrictive in certain cases. Buildings with high internal gains provide a larger APR combined with a lower DHO. As expected, both DHO and TEF increase linearly with the maximum indoor temperature increase allowed in each demand response (DR) event. 4 Conclusions This paper presented a validated soft sensor for thermal inertia-based energy flexibility. A set of experiments were conducted in three rooms. The experiments varied the room internal heat gains and the furniture mass to determine their impact on TEF. The experimental data obtained showed that it is possible to calibrate a simplified RC model that can be used in a soft sensor approach to measure TEF. The calibrated soft sensor was then used to simulate available TEF in several scenarios with variable outdoor conditions and internal gains. The results of the experimental campaign show that, once the HVAC is tuned off, there is a clear difference in the increase over time of room indoor temperature in rooms with heavy and light inertia. Considering that room users should not be subjected to temperature increases above 2 °C, we find that the maximum duration of the HVAC off event decreases with increasing sensible heat gains and increases with overall room exposed thermal mass. The architecture of the proposed RC model relies on the short-term and long-term effective thermal capacity to model furniture and structural thermal mass, respectively. Results show that, using a single HVAC off event, the soft sensor accurately identifies the thermal inertia of the three different test rooms used. In addition, the model is also capable of accurately estimating the overall heat loss coefficient and the heat transfer coefficient between room air and furniture. Furthermore, the sensor validation results demonstrate a strong agreement between measured and predicted air temperature, with root mean square error (RMSE) values below 0.30 °C. Additionally, the soft sensor proves capable of accurately calculating the operative temperature in low air velocity environments, with an RMSE for operative temperature predictions below 0.6 °C. The simulation of available TEF in several scenarios with variable outdoor conditions and internal gains showed that the TEF in modern office buildings varies between 4.7Wh/m2 and 25Wh/m2, depending on factors such as temperature variation, thermal inertia of the room, and outdoor air temperature. Interestingly, internal gains do not significantly impact the TEF, particularly in summer conditions where the decrease in DHO is offset by an increase in average power reduction. The maximum indoor temperature increase is a crucial parameter affecting both the DHO and the TEF potential. The simulation results demonstrate that an increase in allowed indoor temperature increase leads to higher DHO and TEF. For a typical modern office building with a minimum temperature variation of 1.1 °C, the minimum demand response duration is 9 min, while typical DHO ranges are 15 to 60 min. The proposed soft sensor shows promising results although several limitations should be recognized and addressed in future work. Electrical grids need large amounts of coordinated and reliable energy flexibility that can only be obtained by combining several rooms in a building and, if possible, combining several buildings. Considering this challenge there is a need for future research and development work in assessment and control whole building TEF obtained from optimizing thermal storage in different rooms. Optimal control of TEFs and DHOs from different zones is a key challenge in achieving optimal management within a whole building using the proposed soft sensor.

        "dc:description": "To stabilize the grid and reduce the need for grid level energy storage, due to the ongoing increased in the use of renewables for electricity production, building owners are incentivized to adjust their energy needs in demand response programs (DR). A common DR approach in service buildings is to temporarily turn off the HVAC system, triggering thermal inertia-based building electrical demand flexibility (TEF). TEF varies depending on internal loads and weather conditions. Currently the amount of TEF that can be provided to the grid is generally unknown to building managers and grid operators. This paper fills this gap by presenting a new soft sensor approach for estimation of TEF in cooling dominated service buildings. The proposed sensor was tested in three rooms with different thermal inertia and internal gains. The TEF potential was assessed in a typical modern office by simulating several DR events with different setpoint temperature variations, outdoor air temperatures and internal gains. Results show that the minimum duration of the HVAC off event (DHO) is 9 min for a 1.1 °C operative temperature increase, with typical durations of 15 to 60 min. The TEF values vary between 5Wh/m2 and 25Wh/m2.",
