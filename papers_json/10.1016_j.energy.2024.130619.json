Transilvania University of Brașov Department of Electronics and Computers Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Brasov 500036 Romania Handling editor: Henrik Lund Energy consumed by HVAC (heating, ventilating and air conditioning) systems represents a considerable part of the energy consumed in buildings. This paper focuses on achieving energy efficiency, through automatic control strategies, of HVAC systems in the biopharmaceutical industry, a sector little covered by previous studies, mainly focused on residential and commercial buildings. The system under study is an air handling unit (AHU). The main contributions of this research are the obtaining of a dynamic, multivariable, and non-linear model of the AHU, proposing a relatively simple structure and the procedure to estimate its parameters; a non-linear static model of the power consumption of its bank of electrical resistors, also simple, but useful to guide the PID tuning toward energy efficiency; and the approximation to the model of a PID controller whose control low is unknown. The methods proposed to obtain the models and to perform the simulations are also provided. Results for a close-to-reality simulation scenario that suggests the possibility of reducing the power consumed by the resistor bank by 29 % are presented. The use of an industrial PI control algorithm, instead of the classical textbook algorithm, also distinguishes this work from others. Keywords HVAC (heating, ventilating and air conditioning) systems Air handling unit (AHU) Dynamic, multivariable and nonlinear model Hammerstein-Wiener models Reduction of energy consumption Data availability Data will be made available on request. 1 Introduction HVAC (heating, ventilating, and air conditioning) systems are responsible for ensuring adequate air conditions in rooms (temperature, relative humidity and cleanliness) and their complexity and operating characteristics depend on the type of place whose air is to be treated. They are responsible for 40\u201350% of energy consumption in buildings [1,2]. Meanwhile, buildings account for more than 40% of the energy consumption produced globally, with more than one third of this fraction corresponding to the heating and cooling of rooms [3]. These are only two of the functions of HVAC systems, if ventilation and its corresponding energy costs are added, it is not surprising then that, in the building sector, HVAC systems are one of the most relevant areas in terms of energy saving measures [4]. In fact, the efficient operation of HVAC systems has proven to be the most promising way to reduce energy consumption in buildings, while control strategies of HVAC systems have been the focus of the most recent studies, among the diverse solutions for energy saving in buildings [5]. This work focuses on the energy-efficient control of an air handling unit (AHU), considering that its correct operation is vital to ensure the efficiency of the HVAC system to which it is integrated [6]. The AHU under study must provide adequate indoor climatic conditions for five cleanrooms (three class D, two class C, and one class A space, according to Annex 1 of the EU GMP [7]) in a biopharmaceutical industry. 1.1 Survey of the state of the art and research gaps A literature search on energy efficiency of AHUs was performed in the Web of Science Collection (https://webofscience.com/wos/woscc) using the following keywords: 1) \"energy efficiency in air handling unit (AHU) control\", 2) \"energy management of air handling unit (AHU)\" and 3) \"energy saving strategies for air handling units (AHU)\". The search was focused on the last few years, especially the last two years since a comprehensive state of the art review on the subject was presented in Ref. [1]. Some papers found using the keywords: 4) \"energy efficiency in HVAC systems\" were also reviewed. As a result of the analysis of the literature found in the above-mentioned source and time frame, the following approaches for achieving energy efficiency were identified: 1) Control strategies and algorithms. 2) Fault detection and diagnosis (Refs. [8\u201313]) 3) Automation systems (Ref. [14]) 4) Maintenance (Ref. [6]) 5) Design or modification of the HVAC system and/or building structure (Refs. [15\u201317]). Among the control strategies and algorithms, those in which an advanced controller (implementing optimization methods and/or artificial intelligence techniques) establishes the optimal references for the control loops of the variables of interest of the AHU or other component of the HVAC system are predominant. With this approach, Lin et al. proposed to reduce the pressure setpoint of the HVAC system, as well as control based on occupancy levels and early system shutdown when a floor has been empty for 15 min [18]. Turning off the HVAC system when no people are detected in the building, floor or rooms, as well as scheduling on and off according to working hours, are frequently observed energy saving strategies, as also shown in Refs. [19\u201323]. The generation of optimal setpoints is also focused on: Zulkafli et al., who used linear programming, taking into account the climatic conditions and the integration of the AHU with the chiller energy management system [20]; Jee et al., who developed a control algorithm based on artificial neural networks to predict energy consumption, considering outdoor air variables such as dry bulb and wet bulb temperatures and relative humidity [21]; Fang et al., who focused on improving the learning efficiency of a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) control strategy [23]; Lin et al., dedicated to the development of a Bayesian optimization framework [24]; Wani et al., who used metaheuristic intelligence for the development of a robust control that minimizes energy use while maximizing occupants' thermal comfort [3]; Yang et al., who developed an optimal stochastic control, subject to thermal demand uncertainty [25]; and Gao et al., whose research developed an optimal control method to calculate setpoints without using a complex penalty function or a system energy model [26]. Meanwhile, in Refs. [19,27\u201330] control algorithms are developed, whose output goes directly to the actuators that manipulate those variables that allow to reach the desired value of the controlled variables. An adaptive control strategy was used by Salins et al. to manage the temperature, dust level and CO2 level control loops (where an on-off control strategy was used), the AHU working schedule and the humidity and airflow control loops (where a sequential logic control strategy is used) [19]; an adaptive fuzzy controller based on genetic algorithms is proposed by Khan et al. [30]; a PID controller is combined with a new design of the air inlet and the thermal insulation of the walls in the research developed by Alghamdi et al. [29]; PID controllers are replaced by fuzzy controllers in the research developed by Chojecki et al., due to the challenge of correct parameter tuning in PID controllers and the negative effect on energy efficiency of a sub-optimal tuning of this type of controller [28], while the same problem is addressed by Ambroziak and Chojecki by applying optimization methods for adaptive tuning of the controllers (readjusting the parameters whenever necessary) [27]. No case studies were found in the literature where an AHU with a bank of electrical resistors in the heating section is modelled, both from the dynamic point of view, to relate the control signals with the controlled variables, and from the relationship between the control signal received by this device and the energy consumption that the behavior of these signals implies. In fact, in most of the works developed in commercial, institutional or residential buildings, only cooling or heating is performed in the AHU, and if both are performed, not simultaneously, except in the case of two works [30,31], in which temperature and relative humidity are controlled simultaneously. In most of the research studies, only room temperature and thermal comfort are of interest. This is not of fundamental interest in industrial production environments, where good manufacturing practice (GMP) requirements focus more on product quality and operator safety, even sacrificing energy efficiency [32]. Among the papers consulted, only three propose solutions for energy efficiency in the industrial sector [8,14,33], and only one [33] addresses the problem from the point of view of control algorithms. In the latter work, moreover, the air-conditioned rooms are clean rooms. Despite the limited nature of this review of the state of the art on the automatic control and energy efficiency of HVAC systems and AHUs, it is concluded that, as evidenced in Ref. [1], case studies in the industrial sector are lacking. Within this sector, in the pharmaceutical industry and specifically in clean rooms, even less research has been conducted. However, industry is a sector that consumes a high percentage of the total energy produced worldwide, with industries such as pharmaceuticals, chemicals and food production being more energy intensive compared to others [34]. On the other hand, the operation and control of HVAC systems in the pharmaceutical industry, specifically in cleanrooms, is more demanding than in other types of rooms and buildings. Clean rooms are spaces where air quality is controlled by modulating variables such as temperature, humidity, particle contamination and pressurization, which means that they can require 30 to 50 times the energy of a common air-conditioned building, representing between 30 and 65% of all the energy consumed by the building [35]. This means that HVAC systems for such buildings need to be highly energy efficient and have a fast response time to protect the products [4]. There are national and international regulations that establish how the production conditions should be in the areas of the biopharmaceutical industry, according to the classification of these areas (given, among others, by 14644-1, with ranges from ISO 5 to ISO 8, relevant for pharmaceutical cleanrooms, or EU GMP, with class A to D) [7,32]. The key to maintaining air quality lies not only in air filtration, but also in the air change ratio (ARC) [32], which is usually between 20 and 60 changes per hour, while in commercial or residential buildings, 2 to 10 changes per hour may be sufficient for comfort [36]. Another distinctive feature of cleanrooms is the need to create pressure differentials between higher class areas and adjacent lower class areas (in terms of air cleanliness), so that when opening doors no air can enter from a less clean area to a cleaner one, avoiding cross-contamination. To comply with all these standards that regulate and guarantee cleanroom safety and product quality and avoid any risk, continuous operation of the HVAC system is usually required, guaranteeing ventilation, air cleanliness, temperature and humidity conditions, regardless of whether or not a productive activity is taking place [36]. The study of the characteristics of cleanrooms shows how much the range of possibilities for optimizing energy consumption is reduced, making solutions such as switching off the system during periods of inactivity in the rooms, a common solution for other types of building, unfeasible in this environment, as seen above. Even the modification of setpoints, looking for energy savings during periods of inactivity, which may lead to a departure from the strict limits for production and imply a risk of contamination or proliferation of micro-organisms, is out of the question. Given that, according to the practical experience of the authors of this paper in automatic control of AHUs in the pharmaceutical industry and in commercial control solutions for AHUs, cascade control of temperature and relative humidity in clean rooms is very common, based on internal control loops that regulate the temperature and humidity of the supply air, it is concluded that there is a gap for savings by applying control strategies that generate optimal references for the internal control loops, as seen in some of the research analyzed above. However, this work argues that is not possible to get the best benefit from those optimal references without ensuring the optimal functioning of the internal loops, starting from their design, the selection of the control algorithm and the optimal tuning of their parameters. However, modifying the design of control loops is often prohibitively expensive in practice, either because of the risk of losing the warranty of a purchased automation product or because of not having a software license to implement such modifications. However, as it is aimed to show in this paper, even under these conditions it is possible to increase efficiency by better tuning the controllers. On the other hand, although in the literature there are works dedicated to the optimization of PID controller parameters, many of them tend to use performance indices based on the error between the controlled variable and the setpoint to follow, as in Refs. [27,37,38], while others, such as Refs. [37,39,40] include the control signal in the cost function as an indirect measure of energy consumption. In this work, instead, we propose the direct use of the electrical power of the resistor bank, modelled as a function of the control signal, for the evaluation of the control quality and prediction of the consumption with a given proposed controller tuning. Finally, none of the research studies reviewed performs validation of the controller model used. In the case of the PID algorithm, some works implement it via hardware or software, and test it in practice or by simulation. Others assume a model, usually \"ideal\", ensuring the match with the algorithm implemented in the controller. However, the reality of the industry is that, with a large number of manufacturers in the market, the implementations of the PID algorithm by each vary. If the correct or approximate model is not used in a design through simulation, the results, when applied, are unlikely to be the same. In this way, the following gaps in the literature can be summarized: - Lack of works where AHUs in clean rooms in the pharmaceutical industry are mathematically modelled from the point of view of the dynamics of the controlled variables in relation to the control signals and from the point of view of energy consumption. - Lack of depth in the description of control system model simulations of a certain complexity (multiple control loops and non-linearities) that would allow easy reproduction of their results in practice. - Lack of validation of control algorithms implemented in industrial controllers and modelling of industrial controllers with unknown dynamics (when the control algorithm is not provided in the technical information). Therefore, the contributions of this work are the following: - Proposal of a model structure simple enough to use but complex enough to reflect the non-linear behavior and interactions between variables of an AHU with cooling and heating, the latter by means of banks of electrical resistors, in the pharmaceutical industry. It is also provided the methodology to obtain, experimentally, the parameters of this structure. - Simulation method in Simulink (MatLab®) of the proposed model and the existing control system based on this model. - Obtaining the mathematical model of an industrial PID controller with unknown dynamics, based on a known PID algorithm. 2 Mathematical modelling for efficient temperature and relative humidity control The mathematical model of the AHU is developed in this work by applying the system identification methodology, which, with a greater or lesser level of detail, has been described by various authors such as L. Ljung [41] or Roffel and Betlem [42]. However, regardless of the level of detail in which this methodology is explained, it is still very general, therefore, it is considered appropriate in this work to present a way of applying it to the process under study. The goal of this section is to obtain and simulate a mathematical model of the existing AHU and its control system. The subsections below illustrate each stage of the applied methodology. 2.1 Description of the system under study Since the AHU does not operate on its own and is linked to its controllers, the studied system includes the air temperature and relative humidity control system in the selected AHU and the set of clean rooms associated with it. This system must ensure that the variables mentioned above, inside the clean rooms to be supplied with air, are in the ranges of 20\u201324 °C, for temperature, and 55\u201365 %, for relative humidity. Fig. 1 shows a diagram of the system, made up of the AHU and the clean rooms, obtained from the technical documentation of the current installed control system. The AHU consists of two air inlets, one from the outside, at a temperature TOa and a relative humidity HuOa, and another from the air duct returning from the rooms, at a temperature TEx and a relative humidity HuEx. The air from both sources is mixed and filtered, and then passes through a heat exchanger (Ccl) through which water flows at 7 °C, cooling the air and condensing the excess humidity. Since the air leaves this heat exchanger with a very low temperature and a relative humidity close to dew point, it then passes through a bank of electrical resistors (ReHcl) that raises its temperature and lowers its relative humidity. The downstream fan (FanSu) ensures the air flow required by the clean rooms. The current control strategy, in Fig. 2 (obtained from the designed control system of this and similar AHUs by a pharmaceutical industry project company), shows a cascade control scheme where the external loop regulates the temperature (TEx) and relative humidity (HuEx) of the air in the rooms, by sending the references to the internal loop controllers, which regulate the temperature (TSu) and relative humidity (HuSu) of the air supplied to the rooms. 2.2 Mathematical model of the AHU For the re-tuning of the internal loops of PID controllers, the final goal in this work, it is useful to have a mathematical model of the process to be controlled, in this case, the AHU. It is also necessary to know the model that describes as accurately as possible the control algorithm, sensors and actuators. As a result of the study of the literature related to the modelling and control of AHUs, as well as experiences with previous experiments on the studied system, it is known that it is a multivariable non-linear system with a strong interaction between its variables. In the bibliography, AHUs and its subsystems are usually modelled either by linear transfer function models, with the advantage of their simplicity and the limitation of their low fidelity outside an operating point, since the real system is non-linear; or by more complex models, such as first principles models, which have the limitation of presenting a large number of parameters that in practice are difficult to find all of them; or neural network models, which are more computationally expensive to develop and use. Therefore, as a part of the contribution of this work, it is proposed to use Hammerstein-Wiener models to represent this system. This kind of model exhibits a balance between its complexity, the computational cost of its use and the relative ease of obtaining them. Hammerstein-Wiener models are generally represented as shown in Fig. 3 [43]. The bibliography consulted about the procedure to identify models of this structure, as is the case of references [43\u201347], defines the signals u ( t ) and y ( t ) in Fig. 3 as the input and output of the system, which are measurable signals, while w ( t ) and x ( t ) are non-measurable internal variables. Thus, during the parameter fitting process of the non-linear and linear structures, only the input and output of this cascade scheme are known, and the fitting method, although separating the estimation of the parameters of each block into distinct stages, is a sequential and iterative process, based on the minimization of the error between the output y ( t ) of the model and the real output of the system. Therefore, a single parameter estimation process is performed, and, as part of the identification methodology, a single validation is performed after the parameter estimation, which is a global validation of the complete scheme that composes the structure of the Hammerstein-Wiener model. A different approach to the problem of parameter estimation for this type of model is proposed in this work. First, it is designed an experiment that allows to decompose the parameter estimation process into two totally independent estimation processes. In this way, it is possible to concentrate most of the non-linear behavior of the system on the static model given by the function f . The experiment design allows w ( t ) to no longer be an unmeasurable internal signal, but the measurable output of the non-linear model f , so that the values of w are given by the steady state values of y ( t ) , thus it is very easy to use a curve fitting method to find a model (either in polynomial form, piecewise linear, a spline or other) that establishes the relationship of w ( t ) to u ( t ) and validate this model before continuing with the parameter estimation of the linear model. Then, the estimation of parameters of the linear model also becomes a relatively simple problem to handle, and for the case study presented here, it is sufficient to use graphical methods to determine the parameters of the selected structure. It is also possible to validate this linear model separately, although in this work it was not done so, but rather, after \"assembling\" the linear model with the non-linear model, it was performed a global validation that allowed to validate both the linear dynamic model obtained and the combination of this with the non-linear model. In the case of the non-linear output model given by the function h , it was used in this work to guarantee compliance with the physical limits of the variables, which is important when using models whose response presents overshooting, given that it cannot go beyond the limit that the physical variable can reach. On the other hand, in the case of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) models, separate nonlinear functions are often used to represent the nonlinearities associated with each input. This is the case for the Matlab® system identification toolbox, which requires the selection of the nonlinearities of each input [48]. However, for the climate process in an AHU, in which there is a large interaction between temperature and humidity, it was considered here more convenient a single nonlinear model with multiple inputs and one output (MISO) to represent the dependence of each output variable on the combination of input variables, because experimentally it was observed that it did not have the same effect on the outputs to increase, for example, by 20 %, the control signal that regulates the bank of electrical resistors when the three-way valve was fully open as when it was fully closed, just as it did not have the same effect if this increase was produced starting from 80 % as if it started from 0 %. Therefore, this paper proposes an experiment that allows to build what in the case of a system with two inputs is observed as grids, in which each point ( u 1 , u 2 ) corresponds to a point y 1 and a point y 2 . Then, for each output, the non-linear static MISO model obtained represents the surface that best fits those points. More points imply higher accuracy in the surface fit, benefiting the parameter estimation of the non-linear models, but at the same time, implies less variation of the outputs, making the estimation of the dynamics by the linear models more difficult. A compromise must be found in the design of the experiment to obtain the grid. Based on the explanation above, the Hammerstein-Wiener model structure shown in Fig. 4 is proposed to describe the AHU under study. As the system identification methodology was applied, the model in Fig. 4 includes the dynamics of sensors and actuators. The following steps were followed for its construction: 1) To develop nonlinear static MISO models. 1.1) Experiment design: to tabulate the steady state values of the variables TSu and HuSu as a function of different combinations of the control signals sent to the control valve that regulates the flow of cold water through the heat exchanger (UV3V) and to the power controller (UVE). It is recommended to cover as much as possible the operating range of the control signals, in this case, 0\u2013100 % of their value, which is an electrical signal from 0 to 10 V DC. 1.2) Selection of model structure and parameter estimation: to perform curve fitting with the tabulated data, trying different models, such as polynomials and splines. 2) To obtain linear models representing the dynamics of each output variable as a function of each input variable. In this work, the experiment that was carried out consisted in tabulating the steady state values of TSu and HuSu for the different combinations of UV3V and UVE. A uniform sweep of UV3V and UVE was made, taking each variable from 0 to 100 % with 20 % jumps, while the other remained constant. When finished, the value of that other input was increased by a 20 % of its maximum value and the procedure was repeated until it also reached 100 %. Table 1 shows the results (focused on the nonlinear models) of this experiment and helps to understand how it was performed. The last three steps of the experiment were different from the way it was designed, because, due to an unexpected event, the experiment had to be concluded earlier than planned. Thus, instead of taking the steady-state values of TSu and HuSu for six values of UVE with UV3V equal to zero, they were taken for four values of UVE. From the tabulated data, the surfaces shown in Fig. 5 were fitted using the Matlab® app Curve Fitter. Plotting the surfaces and analyzing the measures of the error given by the app, the polynomials of Eqs. (1) and (2) were selected to model the input nonlinearities. (1) T S u ( U V 3 V , U V E ) = 26.99 − 1.29 U V 3 V + 1.037 U V E + 0.05714 U V 3 V 2 + 0.001408 U V 3 V U V E − 1.311 ∙ 10 − 5 U V E 2 − 0.001183 U V 3 V 3 − 1.381 ∙ 10 − 5 U V 3 V 2 U V E − 3.473 ∙ 10 − 6 U V 3 V U V E 2 + 1.576 ∙ 10 − 6 U V E 3 + 1.129 ∙ 10 − 5 U V 3 V 4 − 4.005 ∙ 10 − 8 U V 3 V 5 + 9.171 ∙ 10 − 10 U V 3 V 3 U V E 2 − 4.145 ∙ 10 − 10 U V 3 V 2 U V E 3 − 8.355 ∙ 10 − 16 U V 3 V 6 U V E − 0.9869 U V E (2) H u S u ( U V 3 V , U V E ) = 66.5 + 1.822 U V 3 V − 11.97 U V E − 0.538 U V 3 V 2 − 1.557 U V 3 V U V E + 2.231 U V E 2 − 3.258 U V 3 V 3 + 0.8905 U V 3 V 2 U V E + 0.9072 U V 3 V U V E 2 − 0.1153 U V E 3 + 0.5932 U V 3 V 4 + 0.04381 U V 3 V 3 U V E + 0.3675 U V 3 V 2 U V E 2 + 0.7893 U V 3 V U V E 3 − 0.6211 U V E 4 + 1.418 U V 3 V 5 + 0.1446 U V 3 V 4 U V E − 1.07 U V 3 V 3 U V E 2 − 0.4079 U V 3 V 2 U V E 3 − 0.004241 U V 3 V U V E 4 + 0.1506 U V E 5 In the case of HuSu surface, the inputs UV3V and UVE were normalized using means of 52.94 and 50 as well as standard deviations of 33.35 and 35.16 respectively, as a previous step. Therefore, using the model, when evaluating Eq. (2), the mean must be subtracted from each input and divided by the corresponding standard deviation. In the case of the linear models, they are transfer function models as shown in Fig. 6 , where the gain is unitary or very close to one, since the steady state values are provided by the nonlinear blocks and the function of the linear models is to complement it with the dynamical behavior. As the experiment to obtain the non-linear static models at the input consisted of applying a step-type signal sequence, this experiment was also used to graphically estimate the time constant (63.2% of the time in which the output variables reached their steady state value) of four first order models for each output-input relation. The selected structure was this, in a first stage, due to the similarity of the observed response to the behavior of this type of model, as well as being based on previous experience in the identification of this system. Subsequently, based on the validation of the model, it is possible to return to this stage and make some adjustments (such as adding a zero, slightly modifying the estimated time constants and gains, since in the development of the non-linear model the fit of the surface to the measured values was not perfect). On the other hand, the output nonlinearities used were saturations, which restrict the behavior of TSu and HuSu to their physical limits. The disadvantage and main drawback of the proposed approach is the duration of the procedure. The designed experiment, totaling 9 hours, was applied in two consecutive days of work. It should also be considered that, to carry out these experiments, it is necessary to select days in which the clean rooms are not working. The disturbances applied to the system variables, taking them out of their operating point, are not possible during the production processes. The main advantage of obtaining the models in this way is that, with long but simple experiments and models of relatively low complexity, compared to the models proposed in other works, it has been possible to successfully capture the complexity of the system dynamics, the interactions between temperature and relative humidity and their non-linear behavior, as it is shown in the validation tests. As a first step of the validation, the AHU model was solved (simulated) in Simulink, as shown in Fig. 6, which is similar to Fig. 4. However, the non-linear blocks are not simply composed of the models of equations (1) and (2). Fig. 7 shows the logic necessary to connect the non-linear static models of Eq. (1) and Eq. (2) with the dynamic models to simulate the entire AHU model with data sets taken from the real process and check its validity. The method ode4 (Runge-Kutta) was used in the simulation, the sampling time of the clock block was set equal to 1 as well as the time step of the model solving method, while the time constants of all models were divided by the sampling interval ( T s ) of the input data. In Fig. 7, block OutSteadyState is a function implementing, in this case, equation (1). Blocks OutputVariation are functions implementing the algorithm 1. Image 1 The extremely simple algorithm 1, where U_VE_ant and TSu_ant are the previous values of the variables U_VE and TSu, and dTSu is de variation of the steady state values of TSu when changes occur in the control signals, serve as an interface between the nonlinear static model and the transfer functions that made up the value of TSu. This manipulation of the signal is essential to correctly simulate the model by feeding its input variables with a vector of measured values of this variables. The same logic is applied to simulate the behavior of HuSu. The first validation test performed is shown in Fig. 8 and consisted of validation by data comparison between the output of the MIMO non-linear model obtained and the data collected on the last day of the experiments described in Table 1. For the comparison of the model response with these data, the calculation of the goodness-of-fit (Fit) according to Eq. (3) [49], based in the root mean square error [50], which is shown in the legend of each graph, was used. Both the visual information shown in the graphs and the calculated Fit value, suggest that the developed model represents well the dynamic behavior of the system in practically its entire operating range, even at extreme values outside the operating range. Therefore, the limitations with the extrapolation capacity of the models obtained by system identification are addressed in this case from the design of the experiment itself. (3) F i t = ( 1 − \u2016 y − y ˆ \u2016 \u2016 y − y \u203e \u2016 ) ∙ 100 Although the results of the previous validation test are good, it is proposed here to do a much more rigorous test based on two ideas: 1) the validation data set was used for the estimation of the model parameters, and it is not a good practice to use for validation the same data that was used for parameter estimation 2) this is not the behavior that the control signals (UV3V and UVE) usually have during the operation of the system under closed-loop control (the previous experiments were done with the system operating in open-loop). Then, the proposal is to do another validation test by data comparison but stimulating the model with control signals from the system operating in closed loop. The results of this second validation test, shown in Fig. 9 , indicate a degradation in Fit values, however, the graphical data comparation still looks good and the Fit value is around 70% for both outputs, which is an acceptable value. This simulation was performed using data measured for a period of more than 12 h during one day in August 2023, where from initial conditions, more than 50 000 output values were generated by the model. A higher Fit value could be achieved by continuing to fine-tune, trial and error, the transfer function models, checking by simulation the result of each correction made to the models. It should be borne in mind that this lesser Fit value compared with the first validation test may also be due to the always inevitable existence of disturbances not included in the model, such as small variations in the temperature of the cold water that feeds the cooling coil, variations in the heat generated in the clean rooms because of the production process and the variation in the number of people in the clean rooms. External climatic variables have less influence, firstly because the clean rooms are very well insulated from the outside, surrounded for other areas also climatized, secondly because the AHU is not located outdoors, but on a technical floor that is protected from the outside and is influenced by the air conditioning of the building's corridors, and thirdly because, as shown in Fig. 11, the climate in Cuba and especially in Havana, is fairly stable all year round, with little variation in warmth and high relative humidity. Thus, the main disturbance variable, not considered in the model, is the cold-water temperature, which, if the chillers and their control system are working properly, should not vary, but if one or both are malfunctioning, variations in this variable may degrade the quality of the model prediction. Fig. 10 shows the results of more than 5 hours of simulation, using data from one day in April 2023, where the model generates more than 19000 output values. Although visually the behavior of the model seems to be similar to the real process, the Fit values are smaller. This may have been influenced by the temperature of the cold water, both possible variations and the fact that it may have had slightly different values on that day than on the days of the previous experiment. It is also key to simulate the correct choice of the initial condition. The most stable values of all variables should be selected, as starting to simulate in a transient state leads to large errors in the prediction of the model. However, it is difficult to find completely stable states for a sufficiently long time on data obtained from the closed-loop controlled process. 2.3 Mathematical model of power consumption in the bank of electrical resistors In order to guarantee the efficient operation of the internal control loop, a model of the power consumption of the bank of electrical resistors was obtained, following these steps: 1) To measure the power consumed by the bank of electrical resistors as a function of a finite set of values of the control signal that is sent to the three-phase power controller that regulates the operation of the bank. The full range of operation of the bank of electrical resistors must be covered in this experiment. 2) To fit a curve to the collected data. In this work, a network analyzer was used to collect the data of the electric power consumed by the bank of electrical resistors. The least squares method was used to fit the curve that served as a non-linear static model of the power consumption as a function of the control signal. Fig. 12 shows the results of the application of the experiment and the obtaining of the electrical power consumption model, given by Eq. (4). (4) P ( U V E ) = 3.8078 ∙ 10 − 42 U V E − 1.6761 U V E + 0.8655 U V E 2 − 0.0020 U V E 3 Where: UVE - control signal received by the three-phase power controller. P(UVE) - power consumed by the bank of electrical resistors. 2.4 Mathematical model of the controller This work proposes, as a first step to improve the energy efficiency of the AHU control system, which, as seen previously, is a cascade control system, to start by improving the efficiency of the internal control loop. This loop is made up of PID controllers that currently operate as PI. The first idea to address this problem is, keeping the current control algorithms and control loop design, to find a tuning for the controllers that achieves the same or better results in tracking the references, but with a lower energy consumption in the AHU. To do this, the system to be controlled (the AHU) has been modelled, which allows the controllers to be tuned to adequately follow the references, and a model of the power consumption in the bank of electrical resistors has been obtained, to evaluate the energy efficiency of the proposed tunings and allow the best one to be chosen from the energy point of view. To be able to state from a simulation result that the same behavior will be expected in practice, it is not sufficient to have a good model of the process, but also of the controller. In this case, the mathematical model of the PID algorithm implemented in the industrial controller installed in the system is not known. The PID models known and described in the literature on the subject were tested, as well as the models available in Simulink (MatLab®) and, by passing them the references and measured values of the controlled variables, the reproduction of the control signal was unsuccessful. Consequently, the results of this work are based on the use of a PID controller model, also industrial, that is programmed in a function block in Simulink, as shown in algorithm 2, based in the algorithm of a practical implementation of a digital PID controller presented in Ref. [52]. This model was chosen because it showed a response that was the least out of line with the response of the current controller. Image 2 The validation of this algorithm is shown in Fig. 13 , where the improvement of the PID model behavior can be observed when gains are added to its parameters. Fig. 14 shows the representation in block diagrams of the PID model. The resulting PID model was retuned to evaluate the possibilities of an effective control using less electric energy to heat. Results are presented and discussed in the next section. 3 Results and discussion Table 2 shows the current controller tuning and the proposed tuning, based on the use of the AHU model, the bank of electrical resistors power consumption model and the controller model. A simulation was performed by passing to the proposed control system the same values of the references that were collected from the system operating in closed loop. The results of this simulation compared with the response of the real system are shown in Figs. 15 and 16 . They show the proposed controllers improve not only the tracking of the references, but also the power consumption. From Fig. 15 it can be seen that TSu must be kept between the high (SpTSuHi) and low (SpTSuLo) supply temperature set points, while HuSu must follow the supply relative humidity set point (SpHuSu). While the measured system temperature decreases several times and moves up to almost 2 °C away from the SpTSuLo reference, the simulated temperature of the proposed control system stays very close to this reference all the time with minimal deviations. The measured relative humidity, on the other hand, remains appreciably higher than the reference it is supposed to follow all the time. The simulated relative humidity of the proposed control system shows mostly lower values, but still without a good tracking of the reference SpHuSu. From the point of view of energy efficiency, the proposed PI controllers, with their tuning, carried out in this case by trial and error, using the models, outperform the current PI controllers. From the data collected on August and the simulation performed, it is shown that for a time period of more than 12 h, the proposed controllers reduce the energy consumption by 9.89 kW/h, which means a saving of 29 % in the energy consumed by the AHU bank of electric resistors. However, it is necessary to validate this result in the real system, given that the mathematical models of each of its parts (process to be controlled and controller) do not fit perfectly to the experimental data, especially the controller, whose model, although it responds in a similar way, needs to be improved. For cases like this, in which only the controller parameters can be modified, another alternative to take into account, which could yield better results, would be to identify the closed-loop control system, including controllers and process, so as to obtain a single model and not two, whose errors, when closing the feedback loops, could imply a greater error in the closed-loop scheme. If there is a future possibility of being able to change the control algorithm to one whose mathematical model is known, then the approach outlined here, of modelling separately, is preferable. The quality of the validations presented by data comparison was also influenced by \"where to start simulating\". Not just any initial value is suitable, and a bad choice can lead to large errors when comparing model outputs with system outputs, which will not necessarily mean that the model is not good, but that the simulation has not been done well. The problem lies in the fact that the output of the system responds to a past of its inputs that the model does not know, which means that, with a bad choice of the starting point, an inertia is observed at the beginning of the model response not observed in the real system, so that the two responses are never reconciled at any point. In this sense, it is recommend choosing as a starting point one in which both outputs and inputs have been for as long as possible without much variation, the less the better. For future work, it is proposed to develop a process model that includes the cold water temperature, one of the main disturbance variables, to develop a better model of the controller and to test other control strategies for the internal control loops of the AHU. It is also proposed to apply optimization methods for the tuning of the PID controller parameters. As a cost function, it is proposed not to use the commonly used cost functions mentioned in the introduction section, but one that, in addition to taking into account the error of the system output with respect to the reference and perhaps other measures of the quality of the reference tracking, includes the power consumption of the resistors bank explicitly in the cost function. Given that, in this work a model has been developed that allows to know the power that the system is consuming as a function of the control signal, a model that is also non-linear, it is recommended to use the energy values directly, as this is one of the variables desired to be minimised. This would give rise to a multi-objective optimization problem, which would consist of finding the set of parameters of the PID controllers of the internal loop (all of them, since given the dependence of TSu and HuSu of both UV3V and UVE it does not make sense to tune only the controller that acts directly on the resistors bank) that allows good tracking of the references with the lowest possible energy consumption. 4 Conclusions This work has shown a methodology to obtain a non-linear multivariable model of an AHU with heating by means of a bank of electrical resistors in a biopharmaceutical industry. AHUs with this structure and in this type of buildings have been poorly studied in the literature and this work suggests a model structure and provides a methodology that allows to parameterize this model in a simple way. In addition, details are given on how to perform simulations to validate and use them for more energy efficient controller tuning. On the other hand, a variant is presented to deal with PID controllers whose control law is not known, even with limitations and needs to be improved. This models, complemented with the obtaining of a power consumption model of the bank of electrical resistors, serves as a basis for the design of any control strategy that seeks effectiveness in the control of the variables and at the same time energy efficiency. This was evidenced in a simple simulation scenario that suggests that, by using optimization methods in conjunction with the models obtained, it is possible to arrive at a tuning that makes the performance of PID control loops more efficient. Furthermore, it also leaves the door open to the use of other control strategies such as MPC. As fundamental contributions of this work, the models used and the methodology to find them and simulate them should be highlighted. The results were based on simulation scenarios as close to reality as possible, and not based on the response of the system to theoretical stimulus, but to real and common operating stimulus. Based on this model, other control strategies should be evaluated and compared the results. CRediT authorship contribution statement C.A.

        "dc:description": "Energy consumed by HVAC (heating, ventilating and air conditioning) systems represents a considerable part of the energy consumed in buildings. This paper focuses on achieving energy efficiency, through automatic control strategies, of HVAC systems in the biopharmaceutical industry, a sector little covered by previous studies, mainly focused on residential and commercial buildings. The system under study is an air handling unit (AHU). The main contributions of this research are the obtaining of a dynamic, multivariable, and non-linear model of the AHU, proposing a relatively simple structure and the procedure to estimate its parameters; a non-linear static model of the power consumption of its bank of electrical resistors, also simple, but useful to guide the PID tuning toward energy efficiency; and the approximation to the model of a PID controller whose control low is unknown. The methods proposed to obtain the models and to perform the simulations are also provided. Results for a close-to-reality simulation scenario that suggests the possibility of reducing the power consumed by the resistor bank by 29 % are presented. The use of an industrial PI control algorithm, instead of the classical textbook algorithm, also distinguishes this work from others.",
