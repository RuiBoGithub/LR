Information delays, time delays in information exchange between different devices integrated in communication networks, can affect the performance of distributed optimal control but have rarely received attention in the building automation and HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) fields. This paper proposes a delay-tolerant control method to reduce the impacts of uncertain information delays on the performance of the distributed optimal control of HVAC systems. The proposed method reduces the impacts of information delays through synchronizing the local optimization results used for convergence determination and adaptively setting the step-size used for updating Lagrange multiplier. The purpose of synchronizing local optimization results is to reduce the impacts of information delays on accuracy of the optimization results. The purpose of setting the step-size adaptively is to reduce the impacts of information delays on the convergence rate. The computational load of the proposed method is 40 FLOPs (floating-point operations), which can be handled by typical smart sensors. Test results show that the proposed delay-tolerant control method could effectively reduce the impacts of information delays on optimization accuracy and convergence rate, thereby improving the energy performance of the distributed optimal control strategy under conditions where delays occur.

A number of solutions have been proposed, such as fog computing, edge computing and mist computing [2]. These paradigms use low-level devices for optimization and decision-making tasks. In fact, mist computing involves the direct use of IoT devices in computing for different purposes. Adopting this paradigm, optimal control for HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) systems can be achieved in a distributed manner through collectively using the computation capacity of a great number of smart IoT sensors/devices. It provides an alternative means for optimization of decisions on the IoT-enabled building automations systems (BASs) which consists of a large amount of smart sensors. This actually addresses an urgent need in the development and application of IoT in BASs and smart buildings, since real-time optimal control is an effective means of enhancing their energy efficiency in operation. This paradigm can also be used to realize distributed optimal control through the collective use of digital controllers on current LAN-based field control networks. It can improve the energy efficiency of HVAC systems by more effective use of existing BASs, as optimal control can be achieved by utilizing the capacities of distributed field controllers and not just limited central stations. Many researchers have made serious efforts to develop supervisory or optimal control strategies to improve the energy efficiency of HVAC systems [3]. Lu et al. [4] proposed an optimal control strategy based on a modified genetic algorithm to minimize the total energy consumption of an HVAC system. Wang and Ma [5] presented a supervisory control strategy for a complex central chilled water system to improve energy efficiency in real applications. Zhuang et al. [6] proposed an adaptive full-range decoupled ventilation strategy for the cleanrooms and buildings requiring strict humidity control. The test results of these control strategies show that the system energy efficiency could be improved significantly by adopting appropriate control strategies. However, these optimal control strategies are of a centralized form today with a number of major limitations, including relying on central computer stations because of high computational loads, lack of generality and flexibility as they need to be designed for specific systems. Using distributed optimal control strategies is an effective means to overcome these limitations. Distributed optimal control strategies are constructed typically by establishing connections between a number of control or optimization \u201cagents\u201d, each designed for a specific type of component. The distributed optimal control strategies allow better levels of generality, modularity and flexibility, significantly reducing effort in the design and reconfiguration of optimal HVAC system control strategies. Recently, many studies have developed distributed control strategies for building services systems adopting the concept of multi-agent system to increase scalability and modularity [7]. Multiple individual agents can be integrated to form a multi-agent system to achieve a common goal through coordination [8], with each agent being able to perceive the environment of its concern and act to influence the environment according to its goals [9]. Most of these studies focused on adjusting the set-points of the system or process controls such as lighting and HVAC systems according to the information collected by agents (e.g., illumination, temperature, humidity and occupant behavior), to achieve energy saving while maintaining a comfortable indoor environment [10,11]. A few researchers developed agent-based control strategies for real-time optimal control of HVAC systems. The potential benefits and problems of using intelligent agents to realize optimal control of HVAC systems are investigated by Kelly and Bushby [12] and Treado [13]. Wang et al. [14] proposed a model-free distributed optimal control strategy using the decentralized evolutionary method. Cai et al. [15] presented a generic structure of an agent-based optimal control strategy for HVAC systems. Li and Wang [16] and Jiang et al. [17] proposed a distributed approach for optimization of the multi-zone ventilation systems. These studies prove the effectiveness of using distributed optimal control strategies to improve the energy efficiency of HVAC systems. However, operational issues when these strategies are implemented on physical platforms, such as the convergence rate, computation load distribution and information delays, have not been addressed. The authors of this paper [18] investigated the convergence rate and computational load distribution in a previous study. However, the means to deal with information delays are still missing. Information delays refer to time delays in information exchange between different devices over the transmission networks. Such delays are ubiquitous, and in the control field, researchers and engineers have conducted studies related to information delays in the networked feedback control loops since the 1980s. These studies concerned application scenarios where long-distance data transmission is required between sensors and controllers [19]. With the development of IoT technologies and the wide applications of wired and wireless field networks, this has gotten increasing attention in recent years as more and more feedback control loops are being established over data networks [20]. It has been found that information delays could affect the stability of feedback loop control systems [21] and some researchers have proposed corresponding methods to handle this problem [22]. Obviously, enhancing the networking technologies/methods to eliminate the abnormal information delays is the funddamantal means concerning automation platform. Developing methods to reduce impacts of information delays is the essential alternaive means concerning application strategy development. In the distributed optimization field, information delays were not considered in the early studies since they only focused on the \u201cdistribution in software\u201d, i.e., the algorithm was either distributed in different computation packages while typically operating on one computation station or this implementation issue was ignored [23]. However, when deploying distributed optimal control over IoT devices or field controllers as concerned in this study, information exchange through the field networks is essential for achieving global optimization. Some researchers have noticed such application scenarios and have investigated the impacts of delays on distributed optimization algorithms. They have found the distributed optimization algorithms could either converge to incorrect values or fail to converge entirely due to the information delays [24]. For the distributed optimal control strategy, such impacts will result in the reduced energy efficiency of the HVAC systems. Tsianos and Rabbat [25] proposed two ways to model constant delays and random delays and analyzed the impacts of delays by involving the models in the distributed optimization algorithm. The results show that the optimization convergence slowed due to the delays. Nedíc et al. [26] presented a bound on the time required to achieve convergence for the consensus problem using a common consensus algorithm under random delays, given by a function in terms of the system parameters. The convergence characteristics of some other optimization algorithms, such as distributed subgradient projection algorithm [27], dual averaging update [28] and gradient push-sum method [29] are also investigated under information delays. Although these algorithms did achieve convergence in presence of information delays, the diminishing step-size needed to be adopted, which results in low convergence rate. This limits applications in the real-time optimal control of HVAC systems since the optimal control interval in these systems is typically in minutes considering the system dynamics. For algorithms with fixed step-size, Yang et al. [30] demonstrated negative impacts on the convergence rate and optimization results due to delays. Zhao et al. [31] pointed out that there always exists a sufficiently small step-size which can guarantee algorithm convergence under constant finite time delays. But using a small step-size could also reduce the convergence rate. Charalambous et al. [32] therefore, proposed an algorithm which achieves convergence in a small number of steps whether delays exist or not. However, using this algorithm, the relatively high storage and computation capacity of the devices are required since all the historical data are required to be stored in the agents and matrix calculation is needed. Therefore, this algorithm is not suitable to be used for the distributed optimal control strategy deployed over field control devices due to their limited storage and computation capacities. This study, therefore, aims to improve the performance of distributed optimal control strategies deployed for HVAC systems concerning the information delays when deploying on both future IoT-enabled and current LAN-based field control networks. A novel delay-tolerant control method is proposed for this aim. This method is developed based on the analysis of the impacts of information delays on the distributed optimization algorithm. It can effectively reduce the impacts of information delays on the performance of the distributed optimal control strategies and therefore improve the system energy efficiency or thermal comfort of indoor environment according to their optimization objectives. Concerning the limited storage and computation capacities of field control devices, the proposed method requires much fewer capacities than the existing methods, making it applicable in field control devices. 2 Distributed optimal control and impacts of information delays 2.1 Distributed optimal control strategies for HVAC systems Fig. 1 shows two typical deployment frameworks for the proposed distributed optimal control strategies for HVAC systems on current and future BASs respectively. The BAS can maintain the desired indoor environment through automatic monitoring and controlling the building services systems, including HAVC, lighting, security and fire systems [33]. There are two basic categories of control methods concerning building processes: process control or feedback control (controlling the process outputs at their given setpoints) and supervisory control or optimal control (determining the setpoints of controlled processes for best performance) [3]. The current control system consists of several microprocessor-based controllers (digital controllers) with electronic sensors connected. Information sharing among these controllers is enabled by local area networks (LANs). Normally, these controllers are responsible for the process control of the components using proportional-integral-derivative (PID) algorithms. The supervisory controls are accomplished by the central control station using centralized optimal control strategies. Recently, due to the rapid progress of the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, IoT-based smart sensors and control devices have found increasing applications in BAS industry and it is expected that they will have major roles in field control networks in the BASs of next generation [34,35]. The key task of this study is to address a new challenge when implementing the optimal control of HVAC systems using a distributed approach on the platform of current LAN-based field control networks and future IoT-enabled field control networks. As shown in Fig. 1, the proposed distributed optimal control strategies are designed to be deployed on integrated local BAS control devices for the optimal control of typical HVAC systems and subsystems. A distributed optimal control strategy typically consists of a number of agents, each responsible for solving a local optimization problem. Global optimization is then achieved by coordinating these agents through communications over wired or wireless field networks. In this manner, the wasted computational resources of the local control devices in the current or future BASs can be used to jointly undertake the computation load for the optimization process, and the disadvantages of using centralized control strategies as aforementioned can be avoided. 2.2 Optimization process of typical distributed optimal controls In this study, a distributed optimization algorithm based on dual decomposition and the subgradient method [30] is adopted for constructing the distributed optimal control strategies. Its advantages in the convenience of distribution and low computational complexity make it suitable for applications in field control networks. It has been proved to be effective in solving the optimization problems of HVAC systems in the previous studies [15,18]. Adopting dual decomposition, the centralized optimization problem with coupling constraints shown in Eqs. (1) and (2) can be decomposed into a number of subproblems and a master problem, as shown in Eqs. (3) and (4) respectively, f( x ) represents the power consumption of a component in the system.

Fig. 2 illustrates the optimization process of this distributed optimization method. The agents operate in parallel periodically with the received information of the last step from other agents. The component agents are responsible for local optimizations with the received global parameter as shown in Eq. (5). The coordinator agent is responsible for determining the convergence status according to the local optimization results as shown in Eq (6), and for updating the global parameter using the subgradient method if convergence is not achieved, as shown in Eq (7).

In ideal conditions, all local control devices operate synchronously and the time cost for local computation and data transportation is less than one sampling interval. The data of the previous time step is available for the corresponding agents at the current step. The information delays in ideal conditions are denoted as regular delays in this study. However, in practical applications, it is not easy to synchronize the operation of local control devices [20], and the time cost of data transportation may be larger than ideal due to network traffic or even packet loss. The asynchronous operation of local control devices and the long transportation time can result in irregular, uncertain delays. Irregular delays are larger than the sampling interval and can render the local optimization results of the current step unavailable by the next step. Since field controllers generally pick up data from their buffers and process them periodically with a predefined time interval, sampling interval, the effective delay of information exchange between controllers is discrete in terms of the number of sampling intervals. The possible maximum information delay (Md) can be obtained through the time spent for computation (tcpt ) and communication (tcom ) as well as the sampling interval (SI), as shown in Eq. (8). It is worth noting that field controllers can store a few received data in their buffers and will always use the latest data available. Therefore, the packet loss will not result in a situation where no information is available for the use of an agent. (8) Md = ⌊ t com + t cpt SI ⌋ ( b o u n d e d d e l a y ) + ∞ p a c k e t l o s s Because of irregular delays, the convergence rate and optimization results of the distributed optimization algorithms may be affected. The optimization process of distributed optimization when accounting for information delays is shown in Eqs. (9)-(11). Ld denotes the length of the information delay in terms of the sampling interval. Local optimization, convergence determination and Lagrange multiplier updating are conducted using delayed information. Since distributed optimization is conducted in iterations, the impacts of information delays on local optimizations will ultimately affect convergence determination and updating of the Lagrange multiplier. The impacts on Lagrange multiplier updates can further result in lower convergence rate, and the impacts on convergence determination can further result in bias in the optimization results. This may lead to reduced energy performance for the distributed optimal control strategy. x ̇ i , k = argmin x i f λ k - Ld i .(9) (10) Co nv k = S x ̇ 1 , k - Ld 1 , x ̇ 2 , k - Ld 2 , ⋯ , x ̇ i , k - Ld i (11) λ k + 1 = R x ̇ 1 , k - Ld 1 , x ̇ 2 , k - Ld 2 , ⋯ , x ̇ i , k - Ld i Information delays can be classified into two categories according to their lengths, \u201cuniform delay\u201d and \u201cnonuniform delay\u201d. Uniform delay refers to the scenario where the delay lengths between different devices of one step are the same. Nonuniform delay refers to the scenario where all the delay lengths are not the same. Since the wrong subgradient is used, both categories of delays can affect updating of the Lagrange parameter and therefore the convergence rate. Uniform delays will not result in bias in optimization results if convergence can be achieved within the preset optimization interval, since all the local optimization results used to determine convergence are from the same step. Conversely, nonuniform delays may cause biases in optimization results. Based on the impacts of these two kinds of information delay, a novel delay-tolerant control method is proposed to reduce these impacts, as illustrated in Section 3. 3 The delay-tolerant control method As aforementioned, existing delay-tolerant control methods are not applicable in the application scenarios concerned in this study, either because of the low convergence rate or high storage and computation capacity requirements. This study therefore proposes a delay-tolerant control method to improve the robustness of the distributed optimal control strategy deployed on field control networks under inherent uncertain information delays. This method is proposed based on analysis of the impacts of the information delays (more detailed information can be found in [36]) as well as relevant research conducted by Zhao et. al. [5]. It is simple to be deployed on local control devices and is effective in reducing the impacts of information delays on optimization accuracy and the convergence rate. 3.1 Schematic of the proposed delay-tolerant control method The proposed method reduces the impacts of the information delays by improving the operation process of the coordinator agent using the distributed optimization algorithm based on dual decomposition and the subgradient method illustrated in Section 2.2. The operation procedures of the coordinator agent using the conventional distributed optimization method and the proposed delay-tolerant control method are shown in Figs. 3 and 4 respectively. Using the conventional distributed optimization method, the coordinator agent directly uses the received local optimization results to determine convergence status, and update the Lagrange multiplier if convergence is not achieved. Using the proposed method, the results of the previous 2 × Ldmax + 1 steps will be stored and used, where Ldmax is the maximum delay length of one information exchange. In this way, 2 × Ldmax + 1 groups of local optimization results of different steps are available for the coordinator agent. The local optimization results are grouped according to the step information attached (one group corresponds to one step), and the number of optimization results in each group may not be the same due to packet loss and information delays. With the available optimization results, two schemes are introduced in the coordinator agent to reduce the impacts of information delays, \u201csynchronization of local optimization results\u201d and \u201cadaptive step-size setting\u201d. The purpose of the synchronization of local optimization results is to reduce the impacts of information delays on optimization accuracy by ensuring that the local optimization results from the same step (denoted as \u201cuniform results\u201d) are used to determine convergence. The purpose of the adaptive step-size setting is to reduce the impacts of information delays on the convergence rate by conservatively updating the Lagrange multiplier when delayed subgradient information is used. The operation procedure of the coordinator agent using the proposed delay-tolerant control method, as shown in Fig. 4, is further elaborated as follows. At first, the coordinator agent will check whether the latest group of local optimization results are all available or not. If all of them are available, they will be used to determine convergence. If some of them are not available, synchronization of the local optimization results is conducted to \u201cobtain\u201d uniform results for further optimization instead of waiting for the transportation of all optimization results. Waiting for all the latest optimization results to be received can be costly, especially when the number of agents is large due to uncertain delays. This scheme will \u201cobtain\u201d uniform results of a selected step by estimating the missing results. Then, these optimization results after synchronization are used to determine convergence. In such a way, the accuracy of the optimization results and convergence rate can be maintained under information delays. In the case that convergence is not achieved, the adaptive step-size setting scheme will be activated to reset the step-size for updating of the Lagrange multiplier according to the delay length of the uniform results instead of using the fixed step size determined in ideal conditions. 3.2 Synchronization of local optimization results Synchronization of local optimization results is introduced to \u201cobtain\u201d uniform results for further optimization, in the case that the latest available local optimization results are not uniform. This synchronization process involves two major subtasks (shown in Fig. 4), including: a). selecting a group of local optimization results to be used for further optimization, and b). estimating the missing results of the selected group. The following criteria are used to select the group. First, the number of optimization results in each group (except the group with all the results available) are compared with the preset threshold. If the numbers in each of these groups are less than the preset threshold, the latest available uniform results will be used for further optimization. Another option is to use the latest available uniform results regardless of the situation, which can avoid the need to estimate missing data, but this is ineffective in reducing the impacts on the convergence rate. If the number of available optimization results in a group (e.g., the k-1 group) is equal to or larger than the preset threshold, the optimization results of this group will be selected for further optimization. It is possible that the number of available optimization results in more than one group (e.g., the k-1, k-2, and k-3 groups) can equal or exceed the threshold. In this case, the group of optimization results of the latest step will be used for further optimization. After the group is determined, an estimation process is conducted to estimate the missing data, as shown in Eq. (12). (12) x i , k - 1 = x ̇ j , k - 1 x ̇ j , k - L d i × x ̇ i , k - L d i x i , k - 1 is the estimated value of the optimization result of agent i at the k-1 step. x ̇ i , k - L d i is the latest available optimization results of agent i. x ̇ j , k - 1 and x ̇ j , k - L d i are the actual optimization results of agent j at k-1 step and k-Ldi steps respectively. This method is simple but effective when agent i and agent j are agents for local optimizations of the same type components with similar characteristics. It is common that multiple components of the same type (e.g., chillers, pumps, and cooling coils) exist in an HVAC system or subsystem, providing a reliable reference for missing data estimation. For the group of optimization results that do not have available reference components, the group of data at this step will not be used and a group of data at the step of lower priority will be used instead. 3.3 Adaptive step-size setting In the case where convergence has not yet been achieved, the Lagrange multiplier needs to be updated according to the local optimization results and sent to the other agents for the next iteration. A rule-based method is proposed to set the value of the step-size adaptively to improve the robustness of the optimization under uncertain delays. This method sets the appropriate step-size according to the delay length of the uniform optimization results, as shown in Eq. (13). α is the step-size. α 0 is the step-size determined in ideal conditions. α n , ⋯ , α 1 , α 0 ( α n < ⋯ < α 1 < α 0 ) are the step-sizes in conditions with different uniform delay lengths (Ldu ). (13) α = α 0 , Ld u = 0 α 1 , 0 < Ld u ≤ 1 ⋯ α n , n - 1 < Ld u ≤ n The step-size for updating the Lagrange multiplier determines the update rate, which significantly affects the convergence characteristics of the optimization. The advantage of the proposed method is that it can ensure convergence can be achieved at a satisfactory rate under uncertain information delays. Normally, the distributed optimization algorithms will use a fixed or diminishing step-size. The algorithm has a higher convergence rate using a fixed step-size than when using a diminishing step-size, while the robustness of the algorithm using a fixed step-size under uncertain information delays is worse. This is because using the fixed step-size determined in ideal conditions updates the Lagrange multiplier much faster than it should, interfering with the optimization process. As described by Zhao et al. [5], using a sufficiently small fixed step-size can ensure algorithm convergence. Larger constant delays require smaller step-sizes. However, since delays are random in practical application, using the smallest step-size, determined according to the largest delay, can result in an unnecessarily low convergence rate. 4 Performance evaluation of the proposed delay-tolerant control method To evaluate the performance of the proposed delay-tolerant control method, a distributed delay-tolerant optimal control strategy is formulated for the optimal control of a central cooling plant. The target system is shown in Fig. 5 . It consists of three centrifugal chillers, three constant speed cooling water pumps and six cooling towers. The optimization objective of the central cooling plant is to find the individual optimal cooling tower outlet water temperature ( T cwoi ) which can minimize system energy consumption ( P tot ), as shown in Eq (3). Tcon,in is the condenser inlet water temperature. Nct and Nchi are the number of cooling towers and chillers in operation respectively. (14) Min Tcwo , i P tot = ∑ j = 1 N chi P chi , j + ∑ i = 1 N ct P ct , i Subject to : T con , i n = T cwo = 1 N ct ∑ i = 1 N ct T cwo , i The simplified chiller model proposed by Stoecker [37] is used to predict the power consumption of chillers and a simplified method proposed by Wang and Ma [38] is used to calculate the heat transfer from the cooling water to the inlet air in this study. 4.1 Test settings Two control strategies were formulated for the distributed optimal control of the central cooling plant, using the conventional distributed optimization method and the proposed delay-tolerant control method respectively. These two control strategies were tested on a typical summer day with an optimization interval of two minutes. If optimal set-points cannot be found within two minutes, a simple near-optimal control strategy will be adopted: the cooling tower outlet water temperature will be set to be 5 K higher than the current wet-bulb temperature. Uncertain information delays were modelled using a Markov chain ***[41] in the tests. Three possible lengths of information delays were concerned in this study 0 sampling intervals (i.e., regular delays), 1 sampling interval, and 2 sampling intervals. The transition matrix, which gives the probabilities of transition from one state to another state, is shown in Eq. (15). The reason for the impossibility of transition from 0 to 2 sampling intervals is that the agents are assumed to be using the latest available data. In order to present an overview of the impacts of uncertain information delays, the test was repeated by one thousand times with random delay sampling on the test day.

The original optimization problem can be decomposed into a number of sub-problems and a master problem. The sub-problems are expressed by Eqs. (14) and (15) and the master problem is presented by Eq. (16). M cw is the mass flow rate of the cooling water. C is the specific heat. λ is the Lagrange multiplier.

Second-stage optimization is then conducted to find the individual optimal set-points for the cooling towers in operation. The subproblems and master problem are shown in Eqs. (17) and (18) respectively. (17) Min T cwo , i ∑ i = 1 N ct P ct , i + μ ∙ C M cwi T con , o u t - T cwo , i (18) μ ∙ T cwo , o p t - 1 N ct ∑ i = 1 N CT T cwoi = 0 The cooling tower agents, chiller agents are designed to solve their corresponding sub-problems using PMES (performance map and exhaustive search) [42]. The coordinator agent is designed to solve the master problem using the subgradient method, as shown in Eqs. (19) and (20), and determining the convergence status according to the convergence criterion, as shown in Eqs. (21) and (22) respectively. ε and δ are the thresholds to determine convergence and their values are 0.05 K in this case. The step-sizes ( α and β ) in ideal conditions are 5.0 × 10-8 and 5.0 × 10-7 respectively, which are obtained by trial and error. More detailed information about the conventional distributed optimal control strategy can be found in [18].

The parameters of the two proposed schemes (i.e., synchronization of the local optimization results and adaptive step-size setting) to be implemented in the coordinator agent needs to be identified. In this case, since the distributed optimization contains two stages, the parameters in the two stages need to be set separately. At the first stage, the optimization involves the chiller agents, cooling tower agents and coordinator agent. To synchronize the local optimization results, a group of local optimization results used for further optimization needs to be selected. Firstly, groups that the optimization results of the chiller agents are not available for will be excluded. This is to avoid local optimization results of the chiller agents being estimated inaccurately in the scenario that only one chiller is in operation. Then, the number of cooling tower agent optimization results (Nsyn,ct ) in each group will be compared with the number of cooling towers in operation (Nct ). The groups that contain a sufficient number of local optimization results will be chosen, as shown in Eq. (23). Finally, the group of local optimization results of the latest step amongst the candidates will be used for further optimization. The missing optimization results of the cooling tower agents will be estimated according to Eq. (12). (23) N syn , c t ≥ N ct 2 For the updating of the Lagrange multiplier in the case that the convergence is not achieved yet, the step-size will be set according to the delay length, as shown in Eq.

The group of local optimization results used for further optimization is determined in a similar way as the first stage. The threshold for determining whether there are sufficient number of optimization results in one group is also N ct 2 . The step-size is selected according to the delay length, as shown in Eq. (25). (25) β = 5 × 10 - 7 , Ld u = 0 3 × 10 - 7 , Ld u > 0 4.3 Applicability validation and performance evaluation The computational load of the delay-tolerant strategy is assessed to validate the applicability of the proposed delay-tolerant control method in the distributed optimal control of HVAC systems deployed in local control devices integrated in the current LAN-based field control networks as well as future IoT-enabled ones. The floating-point operations (FLOPs) were counted and used as the performance indicator. Using the proposed delay-tolerant control method, the computational load of the cooling tower agents, chiller agents and the coordinator agent at each iteration step were 945, 1150 and 40 FLOPs respectively. Typical smart sensors with the CPU speed of 16 MIPS (million instructions executed per second) are able to handle these computation loads. To evaluate the performance of the proposed strategy, the test results of the control strategy without a delay-tolerant scheme and the delay-tolerant control strategy are compared with the optimal set-points obtained in ideal conditions (i.e., the control devices operating synchronously without delays). Fig. 6 shows the distribution of the set-points generated by the two control strategies and the optimal set-points obtained in ideal conditions (namely ideal set-points thereafter). The minimum value, lower quartile, median, upper quartile and maximum value of the set-points are shown in the figure. The delay-tolerant control strategy was more robust than the control strategy without a delay-tolerant scheme. Using the latter, the lower quartile, median and upper quartile of the optimization results were close to their optimal values. However, the biases between the minimum value or maximum value of the optimization results and the ideal set-points were large, and the maximum bias was up to 0.5 K. Using the delay-tolerant control strategy, all the set-points were much closer to the ideal set-points, and the maximum bias was only 0.2 K. Fig. 7 shows the distribution of the convergence rate of the two control strategies in terms of iteration steps. The proposed method effectively reduced the impacts of information delays on the convergence rate of the distributed optimal control strategy. Using the control strategy without the delay-tolerant scheme, the maximum number of iteration steps mostly remained higher than 120, indicating that the convergence cannot be achieved within the preset optimal control interval. The largest iteration step in this case was over 600 steps (i.e., 10 mins). The number of non-convergent cases was 28,588 (4%). When using the proposed delay-tolerant control strategy, the convergence rate was much faster and more stable - the largest step was 135 (i.e., 2.25 mins) and only 4 cases (0.006%) did not achieve convergence within the optimal control interval during the tests. The daily energy consumption of the central cooling plant using the near-optimal set-points, the ideal set-points, the set-points generated by the control strategy without the delay-tolerant scheme and the delay-tolerant strategy are shown in Table 1 . The energy consumption of the system using the near-optimal set-points is the baseline. The delay-tolerant control method significantly improved the energy performance of the control strategy when accounting for information delays. The daily energy consumption of the system using the set-points determined by the delay-tolerant control strategy was almost the same as that using the ideal set-points, offering energy savings of 0.46%. When using the set-points determined by the control strategy without a delay-tolerant scheme, less energy saving was achieved. In the worst case, energy savings were reduced by 312.82 kWh, accounting for 0.45% of total energy consumption and leaving it at 0.01% only. It is worth noticing that although the saving rate is not very significant, at about 0.5%, the absolute savings are not low, and are achieved without any extra hardware investment. As there are different control variables in the energy system that could be optimized simultaneously, the collective energy savings of control optimization in buildings could be rather significant, particularly when optimization is widely used on both system, subsystem and field levels with the support of distributed intelligence. 5 Conclusions A simple and effective delay-tolerant control method is proposed to improve the performance of distributed optimal control strategies for building HVAC systems under information delays. The proposed method provides the means to deal with the impacts of information delays and addresses the needs to be implemented on field control devices. For the current BASs, this method could broaden the applications of the optimal control of HVAC systems, by using the distributed computation resources of digital controllers integrated in field control networks. For the future BASs, this method provides an approach to fully utilize the IoT-enabled field control networks for the optimal control of HVAC systems and support the development and applications of the emerging IoT technologies in the building automation industry. The applicability and performance of the proposed delay-tolerant control method when deployed in field control networks are assessed by tests on a simulated central cooling plant. According to the test results and analysis, the proposed delay-tolerant method effectively improved the energy performance of the distributed optimal control strategy. Using set-points determined by the delay-tolerant control strategy, the energy consumption of the system was almost identical to that using the ideal optimal set-points. When using the set-points determined without a delay-tolerant scheme, daily energy savings were reduced by 312.82 kWh, accounting for 0.45% of total energy consumption. This is accomplished by reducing the impacts of information delays on the optimization accuracy and convergence rate. Using the proposed method, optimization results nearly equaled actual optimal values (the maximum bias was 0.2 K), and almost all optimizations were converged within 120 steps (two minutes). Without a delay-tolerant scheme, the biases in optimization results were clearly larger (the maximum bias was 0.5 K), and 4% of cases did not achieve convergence within 120 steps. Moreover, the computational load of the proposed method is small enough to be handled by smart sensors and local control devices. The computational load of the cooling tower agents, chiller agents and the coordinator agent were 945, 1150 and 40 FLOPs respectively, well below the capacity of typical smart sensors today. The future work will focus on the more direct validation of the proposed method by conducting experimental tests.

        "dc:description": "Distributed optimal control deployed on field control networks has gotten increasing attention with the rapid development and wide applications of the Internet of Things, including the applications in building automation. Information delays, time delays in information exchange between different devices integrated in communication networks, can affect the performance of distributed optimal control but have rarely received attention in the building automation and HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) fields. This paper proposes a delay-tolerant control method to reduce the impacts of uncertain information delays on the performance of the distributed optimal control of HVAC systems. The proposed method reduces the impacts of information delays through synchronizing the local optimization results used for convergence determination and adaptively setting the step-size used for updating Lagrange multiplier. The purpose of synchronizing local optimization results is to reduce the impacts of information delays on accuracy of the optimization results. The purpose of setting the step-size adaptively is to reduce the impacts of information delays on the convergence rate. The computational load of the proposed method is 40 FLOPs (floating-point operations), which can be handled by typical smart sensors. Test results show that the proposed delay-tolerant control method could effectively reduce the impacts of information delays on optimization accuracy and convergence rate, thereby improving the energy performance of the distributed optimal control strategy under conditions where delays occur.",
