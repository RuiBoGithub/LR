Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems account for the bulk of a building's energy use, which means that potentially significant energy savings can be made by efficiently modifying how those systems are operated. Although several studies have demonstrated that optimizing the operation of HVAC equipment in combination with sensor readings can reduce potentially wasteful processes, such efforts are limited to buildings that have or can incorporate additional sensors. As an alternative approach, this paper aims to identify potentially wasted energy and provide suggested improvements for buildings that do not have installed sensors, which is important because such suggestions can extend the scope of energy reduction measures. More specifically, we hypothesized that comparing differences in user operations would make it possible to identify potentially wasteful operating times. Accordingly, we began our study by identifying target days and days for improvement using data envelopment analysis and then detected operational differences by comparing their operating times. Our new method was then applied to variable refrigerant flow systems in an office building as a case study. The obtained results showed that the potential for energy reduction was about 7.5%. These results, which helped determine the appropriate times for automatically shutting down each indoor unit, proved effective in implementing energy reduction measures. The novelty of this paper is that it clarified the energy waste that can be detected based on operating times, which is expected to lead to the development of additional options for energy reduction measures, thereby allowing building owners to implement more effective actions based on the sizes and conditions of their buildings. Graphical abstract Image 1 Keywords Energy management Data envelopment analysis Office buildings Cooling energy use 1 Introduction 1.1 Background Despite the promotion of non-fossil energy use, fossil fuels are still responsible for a large share of energy consumption and their use is slightly increasing [1,2]. Reducing the global environmental impact of building service and technologies is fundamental for sustainability because buildings are dominant energy consumers. In fact buildings are among the largest consumers of electricity, accounting for approximately 40% of global consumption. Of this, approximately 40% is consumed by heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems [3]. Thus, improving the operation of HVAC systems can be an effective means for reducing the energy consumption of buildings. It was reported that HVAC systems run on fixed schedules and that they do not employ any fine-grained control based on detailed occupancy information [4]. By using sensor data to control HVAC systems, the study showed that a potential energy savings of 10\u201315% can be achieved. For entire buildings, it was demonstrated that more than 50% of energy is wasted during times when buildings are not being used [5]. Therefore reducing unnecessary equipment operation is important because it can result in significant energy savings. These previous studies used sensors to control the HVAC system to reduce wasteful operation, but even without these sensors, it might be possible to achieve energy savings from operation history data. The intelligent building management system (IBMS) can grow with these new sensing and expansion technologies, so even as tools such as smart data sensors, IoT-connected office equipment, and video conferencing are added, it is possible to control them all from a central platform. While a building management system (BMS) is able to turn on the heat and lights at a certain time in the morning, IBMS can use much more complex logic to achieve more granular control. For example, IBMS can turn on the heat and lights when a specific person comes into the office, and then adjust the brightness and temperature levels according to their personal preferences. Such a system can be more effective if installed in a building where the controls can reduce wasteful operation. In practice, a study was conducted in a residential area to analyze the energy reduction potential in advance to find targets where such efforts could be more effective [6]. However, not all buildings are IBMS-compliant, and IBMS is difficult to implement in some buildings due to their size or other circumstances. The scope of this paper is to analyze buildings that have limitations for using sensors and smart control like IBMS, to identify wasteful energy usage and implement energy conservation measures. The target of this study was a variable refrigerant flow (VRF) system, which consists of multiple indoor units. VRF has advantages over ducted air conditioning, such as eliminating duct losses, ease of installation, and flexibility in combining indoor units [7]. Fig. 1 shows a sketch of a VRF system. Indoor units may have one-to-one correspondence with rooms, like room A, B, and C, or multiple units may be installed in a single room like room D. Each indoor unit is operated independently by users, so each day's operation will be different. Zhang et al. [8] revealed that VRF systems have a very large diversity of on/off cycles for each indoor unit in an office. They reported that the energy use, assuming continuous operation within a certain time, was higher than the actual energy consumption and speculated that this was due to the diversity in on/off cycles of operation to meet personal need for thermal comfort from each indoor unit. Fig. 2 , for example, shows the total daily operating time of two indoor units during a given cooling period in an office building. The operating time is the time the user expects the HVAC equipment to control the temperature to a specific set point, not the time the equipment actually uses its refrigeration capacity. The figure shows that there is actually a difference in the operating time between days. It is difficult to identify the cause, but it indicates that there are some days when less operating time is needed. Each day of operation with fewer operating hours may be a worthwhile goal to aim for. If these days with shorter operating time are considered to be the ideal operation and are set as target days, the difference in operating time between the target days and the other days may provide a hint to find the operating time that may be wasted. To test this hypothesis, it is necessary to evaluate daily operations in some way. Especially in the case of VRF, because the number of indoor units is variable, the operating time of each indoor unit is multidimensional. Therefore, it is necessary to assess the operational efficiency with multidimensional data. 1.2 Review of existing studies Improving building operations is typically performed by assessing various energy efficiency measures already present in a building, and then targeting those that perform relatively poorly [9]. To assess the energy performance, a variety of ways, including engineering calculations, simulations, statistical methods, and machine learning were proposed and the relative advantages of each were examined [10]. Among them, data envelopment analysis (DEA) is a non-parametric method that has been widely used to evaluate the efficiency of multi-input and multi-output data [11,12]. DEA has many applications in the field of building energy usage because it can deal with multi-input and multi-output data. In DEA, what is being evaluated is called a decision making unit (DMU), which is a generic term that can refer to many things, including a city, government, bank branch, university, hospital, product, or company. In all cases, it has inputs and outputs. In the energy assessment of buildings, each building was a DMU, and energy use intensity (EUI) was used as an input variable, and revenue, occupancy rate, and floor area were used as output variables [13]. Another model was proposed to create a regression model for the EUI, using predicted values as outputs and observed values as inputs [14]. However, outliers were not considered at this time; in DEA, outliers distort the frontier and can significantly alter the results, so they should be eliminated. Later, the outlier was detected and removed [15]. Furthermore, using a plain EUI ignores the effect of temperature, so the EUI normalized for temperature effects was used for input [16]. However, under the DEA formulation the convexity axiom may be violated if a ratio value, such as the EUI, is considered as an input variable. In addition, previous studies did not distinguish uncontrollable factors, such as the number of tenants in a building, from controllable factors, which could hinder efforts to make improvements. These problems were remedied and a sophisticated method was proposed in a later study [22]. The above discussion shows that it is important in DEA applications to consider outliers, to avoid using ratio values as inputs, and to treat uncontrollable factors separately. Therefore, a method for evaluating the residuals of the regression model by DEA was applied to a chiller system, superseding the previous method [23]. This was specific to the operation of HVAC equipment; that is, the operating status of an HVAC unit at a given time was treated as a DMU to evaluate which hours of operation were better. The application of DEA to the other air conditioning systems was performed under installation conditions for floor-standing air conditioners [24]. To the best of our knowledge, DEA has not yet been applied to a VRF system for optimizing its operation settings. One of the difficulties of DEA is that it may be infeasible for inefficient DMUs to reach efficient DMUs with a single move. To address this issue, Lim et al. [17] used a stepwise improvement method that is elementary to the idea of context-dependent DEA (CD-DEA) [25]. CD-DEA is a model that builds the frontier hierarchically. Let the set of all DMUs be J 1 = {DMU j , j = 1, \u2026, n} and J l+1 = J l − E l . E l = {DMU k ∈ J l |θ*(l, k) = 1}, where θ*(l, k) is the optimal value of the following input-oriented constant returns-to-scale (CRS) envelope model. j ∈ F(J l ) implies DMU j ∈ J l . (1) θ * ( l , k ) = min θ ( l , k ) , s . t . ∑ j ∈ F ( J l ) λ j x i , j ≥ θ ( l , k ) x i , k , i = 1 , \u2026 , m ∑ j ∈ F ( J l ) λ j y r , j ≤ y r , k , r = 1 , \u2026 , s λ j ≥ 0 , j ∈ F ( J l ) When l = 1, Eq. (1) is the typical input-oriented CRS envelope model. When l = 2, the second level frontier is constructed after removing the DMU on the first level frontier. In CD-DEA, the indexes of attractiveness and development can be used. When DMU q is viewed from a certain level E l 0 , l 0 ∈ { 1 , \u2026 , L − 1 } , H q * ( d ) is called the d-order attractiveness from level E l 0 . (2) H q * ( d ) = min H q ( d ) , d = 1 , \u2026 , L − 1 s . t . ∑ j ∈ F ( E l 0 + d ) λ j x i , j ≤ H q ( d ) x i , q , i = 1 , \u2026 , m ∑ j ∈ F ( E l 0 + d ) λ j y r , j ≥ y r , q , r = 1 , \u2026 , s λ j ≥ 0 , j ∈ F ( E l 0 + d ) For D M U q ∈ E l 0 , l 0 ∈ { 2 , \u2026 , L } , M q * ( g ) = G q * ( g ) − 1 is called the g-order progress from the level E l 0 . (3) G q * ( g ) = min G q ( g ) , g = 1 , \u2026 , l 0 − 1 s . t . ∑ j ∈ F ( E l 0 − g ) λ j x i , j ≤ G q ( g ) x i , q , i = 1 , \u2026 , m ∑ j ∈ F ( E l 0 − g ) λ j y r , j ≥ y r , q , r = 1 , \u2026 , s λ j ≥ 0 , j ∈ F ( E l 0 − g ) To select a valid DMU in a stepwise manner, attractiveness, progress, and infeasibility are used in CD-DEA. Lim et al. explained that the difficulty of improvement in that the feasible operating point represented by a linear combination of existing efficient DMUs are not real data. To avoid this situation, only existing DMUs were used as targets for improvement. In contrast, various methods that include feasible operating points have been proposed, such as two-step improvement [19] and the gradient-based method [20]. In this case, the improvement target is flexible because there are countless feasible operating points. However, because the number of existing DMUs is limited, the flexibility in selecting targets for improvement is constrained. Park et al. [18] raised the issue of increased improvement costs due to so-called zigzagging because of this inflexibility. They also took issue with the fact that the existing literature does not discuss the consistency of resource allocation for improvement. They solved this problem of the improvement path by using the K-means method of classification. The above study shows that when using the existing DEA, it is effective to keep the improvement consistent and prevent the zigzagging problem. An et al. [21] dynamically incorporated constraints on the improvement and proposed a path that jumps across layers within the constraints. Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of these studies related to the improvement pathway. In the table, an en-dash (−) indicates that the absence of the concept of layers. An authentic DMU is a data point that actually exists, and a feasible operating point is a linear combination of these points. 2 How can DEA increase energy savings?

Fig. 3 shows the flowchart of our method. The aspects covered in this section include the colored items in Fig. 3. The remaining items are dealt with in section 3 as we discuss the case study. When applied to a different system, this procedure should be followed in the same manner. In this case, it is important that the improvements be feasible and acceptable because reducing the use of air conditioning equipment may be detrimental to comfort. There may be multiple indoor units in one room, and because the total number of people in the office remains the same, treating each indoor unit separately may lead to a more stringent target setting. Therefore, the use of indoor units should be treated simultaneously. The object of evaluation in this study is the daily operation of air conditioning units. Therefore, we defined the daily operating conditions as DMUs to manage the building in DEA. As Table 2 shows, the evaluated example data included the operating hours of each indoor unit, A, B, and C. The operating hours of the indoor unit on July 5 are treated as DMU 3. The subscripts serve as identifiers. The input variables of the DEA are the total daily operating time of each indoor unit of the VRF system, and they have the same number of dimensions as the number of indoor units, for example, 3 dimensions in system 2 of Fig. 1. DEA requires input and output values, but because no corresponding value exists for the output, C = 1 was used. In this study x i,q represents the sum of the operating time of indoor unit i on a day. For example, the data for July 2 in Table 2 mean DMU 2, at which time the values of x 1,2, x 2,2, and x 3,2 are 828, 690, and 688, respectively. To improve operations by reducing the number input values, an input-oriented DEA with a CRS frontier is used. In this study, we used only existing DMUs to emphasize the feasibility and acceptability for improvement, because an existing DMU has more detailed information than that of a feasible operating point. Fig. 4 clarifies the problem of improvement paths in two-dimensional data. Each point is a DMU, meaning it the operating data of 1 day. For example, point B shows how long unit A and unit B operated on a given day. In the case of normal DEA, the target D M U K * is not an existing DMU, so a detailed comparison is impossible. This is because the total operating time, which is the input of the DMU, is calculated from hourly data, but in the case of a feasible operating point D M U K * , the original hourly data do not exist. In addition, it may be difficult to reach the goal in a single move. In contrast, in the case of a stepwise improvement, in addition to the problem of zigzagging, achieving multiple improvements is very complex. This is especially noticeable when it takes excessive manual effort to compare DMUs to each other to make improvements. To cope with this, the cross-layer concept is incorporated. As shown in Fig. 4, the proposed method follows this method and prevents the path from becoming redundant. We add additional constraints to achieve consistency in the improvement pattern. 2.2 Application of DEA for acceptable improvement First, we applied CD-DEA and divided all DMUs into their respective layers. Then, the set of all DMUs J 1 is equal to ∪1≤l ≤ L E l . Instead of always selecting a goal from the next layer, it is necessary to determine the final goal layer to jump from one layer to the next. In this case, the final target layer is determined as E T from T ∈ {1, \u2026, L − 1}. Ordinarily, it is sufficient to set T = 1, but if the layer has only one DMU due to outliers, or if the operational values are not reasonable from a practical standpoint, the second and subsequent layers should be set as target layers. Then, the set of DMUs to be improved is ∪ T < l ≤ L E l . Next, for a given DMU q ∈ ∪ T < l ≤ L E l , we identify a set of candidate improvements to find the target D M U q k * . The set of candidate targets for DMU q is expressed as ∪ T ≤ k < l 0 E k using the layer l 0 to which DMU q belongs. D M U q k * is the target for improvement of DMU q , and k* is chosen from F ( ∪ T ≤ k < l 0 E k ) . This indicates that the target DMU belongs to a higher layer than layer l 0 to which the DMU q belongs. From this set, we choose the most effective DMU within a realistic range. First, to limit the target to realistic values, a set of candidate improvements is created by excluding DMUs with low feasibility. We impose a constraint on the selection of the improvement destination. Because the purpose of this paper is to find the days on which we can operate with fewer operating hours, the total input values should be less for the improvement target. This is achieved by placing a constraint that the target candidate D M U q k for a certain DMU q satisfy the following, (4) ∑ 1 ≤ i ≤ m ( x i , q − x i , k ) > 0 In addition, the amount of improvement at a time is limited to the difference of the total input values less than or equal to C. In other words, for a given DMU q , the target candidate D M U q k should satisfy the following. (5) ∑ 1 ≤ i ≤ m ( x i , q − x i , k ) ≤ C If J q 1 is the set of DMUs satisfying Eq. (4) and Eq. (5) for DMU q , then the set of candidate improvement destinations within the feasible range is ∪ T ≤ l k < l 0 E l k ∩ J q 1 . This is a constraint for feasibility, which will suppress reckless improvements. This constant C should be determined by the business owner and should be understood by both the building owner and occupants. For example, the total amount of improvement at one time should not exceed 3 h. For more flexibility, it is also possible to put a constraint on each indoor unit, rather than on the total amount of reduction. For example, the amount of reduction for each indoor unit could be less than C. This should be used differently depending on the user. It is also possible to completely exclude an indoor unit from the improvement system. This can be handled in the DEA framework by treating it as an uncontrollable input variable. Fig. 5 shows the region restricted by Eq. (4) and Eq. (5) for DMU K . For example, because DMU I is on a higher layer than DMU K but does not satisfy the constraint Eq. (4), so it is not a candidate for improvement. Similarly, DMU B is in the layer above DMU K , but it does not satisfy the constraint Eq. (5), it is not a candidate for improvement. The size of this region is constant regardless of the DMU, but it can be treated as dynamic if it reflects the hypothesis that when the candidate is closer to the first layer, it is harder to improve. Finally, for all DMUs belonging to the feasible range of candidate improvement destinations ∪ T ≤ l k < l 0 E l k ∩ J q 1 , we calculate the progress and attractiveness, and find the most effective improvement target D M U q k * for DMU q . For D M U q k ∈ ∪ T ≤ l k < l 0 E l k ∩ J q 1 , we calculate the attractiveness as H k * ( l 0 − l k ) and the progress as M k * ( l k − T ) . The attractiveness is the efficiency of D M U q k as measured from the layer to which DMU q belongs, and the progress is the efficiency of D M U q k as measured from the T layer. Using the above values, the improvement target D M U q k * for DMU q is obtained as follows. (6) D M U q k * = a r g max k ∈ F ( ∪ T ≤ k < l 0 E k ∩ J q 1 ) H k * ( l 0 − l k ) / M k * ( l k − T ) Lim et al. [17] dealt with feasibility in a soft way and used a linear combination of three indicators: attractiveness, progress, and infeasibility. In contrast, we treat infeasibility in a concrete way, so only the progress and attractiveness are used in our method. Because each indicator is a percentage value, it seems more natural to consider the indicators in terms of their percentages rather than a linear combination. Algorithm 1 summarizes the above methods. Algorithm 1 Select the target DMUs from the set of all DMUs. Image 1 2.3 Pros and cons of our proposed method According to Table 1, the combination of using attractiveness and progress as evaluation indices and reducing the cost of improvement, specifically, using the cross-layer pathway, was not found in existing studies, so this method is a new combination here. The advantage of a pathway over layers is that it reduces the occurrence of zigzagging. This is effective for an area where a single improvement itself requires a large amount of effort. The disadvantage to this, however, is that it requires the setting of appropriate constraints. Some constraint conditions can cause zigzagging and problems with missing improvement candidates. In this study, if no candidate for improvement is found for a given day, the problem does not arise in this case because the day is treated as a unique day that is difficult to improve. The advantage of using attractiveness and progress is that they are influenced not only by the target data but also by the data of the layer to which they belong, and that they can balance the amount of improvement needed now with the amount of improvement needed next. The latter may work effectively if the assumption is to separate improvement paths to the final layer. The disadvantage is the opposite of the advantage: the evaluation indicators for determining goals are influenced by the layers. If the selection of improvement candidates does not need to be influenced by the surrounding data, it will have a negative effect. 2.4 How to improve DMUs The proposed method identifies the DMUs to be improved to a specific target. This section explains how to use them to achieve actual energy reduction. To use the results, two main types of comparisons were used: daily and statistical. 2.4.1 Day-by-day comparison Because we only deal with existing DMUs that have hourly data, we can compare the days that need to be improved with the target days to reveal which times of the day had longer operating times. Our objective is to show specific differences that allow users to identify wasteful use of HVAC equipment. 2.4.2 Statistical comparison By comparing all the days to be improved with the target days and counting the time periods that had more differences, we can look at the differences as a whole. We expect this to be useful for determining whether to introduce automatic controls during a given period of time. 2.4.3 Interpretability of improvement pathways Improvement pathways are not directly used to propose energy reduction methods, but they provide an auxiliary analysis to interpret the existing policies. Usually, DEA improvements are proportional, but they are more flexible like a slack-based model [26]. Because the improvement in this study was from an existing DMU to another existing DMU, various patterns of input reduction are used to achieve improvement. In this case, it is useful to analyze what types of improvement methods are classified to interpret and use the results. In this study, we used the K-means method to classify the amount of input value reduction required for improvement. In doing so, the optimal number of clusters was estimated using the Davies-Bouldin index [27]. 3 Case study 3.1 Experimental procedure We demonstrated how excessive air conditioning control can be suppressed using operation history data and how it can be achieved in our target building. In Fig. 3, the operational data of air conditioning equipment is first obtained during the cooling period. From there, the proposed method identifies the days when the operating time can be improved and the days when the operating time should be targeted. Finally, we compare the daily operating data with those results and examine what kind of control is actually possible using the centralized controller described in section 3.2.2. When applied to a different VRF system, this procedure should be followed in the same manner, but when applied to a non-VRF system, it may be necessary to devise a way to accommodate that system. 3.2 Dataset 3.2.1 Target building and system equipment Our study target is an office building in Japan with cooling period extending from 2021/07/01 to 2021/08/31. The building has two floors, and the basic working hours are from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. which are adjusted as needed. The system in question controls the rooms on the second floor. Fig. 6 shows the layout of this floor. This office building has 80 employees, and approximately 10 people work in target rooms A, B, and C during each day. The target VRF system consists of three indoor units, A, B, and C, and one outdoor unit that has a single variable speed compressor. The unit type of the system is a multi-unit air conditioner for stores and offices. The refrigeration capacity of the outdoor unit is 28 kW, while that of indoor unit A is 11.2 kW, B is 4.5 kW, and C is 3.6 kW. For a VRF system consisting of multiple indoor units, the operating status of each indoor unit can be obtained through a cloud system in our environment, making it possible to record how many minutes during each hour that a unit has been running. The operating time is not the time when the compressor in the outdoor unit was at capacity, but the time when the remote control switch of the indoor unit is turned on. This is the time indicates the need for air conditioning by the user. Fig. 7 shows the operating time of indoor unit A on August 2 and 19. Based on Fig. 2, the total operating time on August 2 looks relatively long and the total operating time on August 19 seems to be one of the shortest days in the data set. By comparing these two days, Fig. 7 reveals that there is a significant difference in operating hours before 7 a.m. and after 7 p.m. Thus, by understanding both the daily and time differences, it maybe possible to determine whether there are operating hours that can be suppressed. 3.2.2 How to control air conditioning units Fig. 8 shows the relationship between the centralized controller and the air conditioning equipment. The controller is capable of serving as an interface for the building automation and control networking protocol (BACnet) for BMS integration. With the BACnet server gateway option, the controller provides BMS integrators with the ability to monitor and/or control the VRF indoor and outdoor units. Each indoor unit is connected to its own remote controller, which can control the on/off, temperature, and airflow rate settings. The centralized controller can perform the same control as each remote controller, and can specify the settings of which control is performed at what time. 3.2.3 Raw data of operating history and its statistics By excluding data with obviously different uses during the preprocessing stage, the number of homogeneous uses and the influence of outliers were reduced. According to Table 3 , unit A operates for the longest time, while units B and C have a wide range of values and variation in operating time. Especially for unit C, the shortest operating day is only half as long as the longest operating day. Table 4 indicates all DMUs and Fig. 9 , Fig. 10 , and Fig. 11 show the distributions of operating times per hour and Fig. 12 , Fig. 13 , and Fig. 14 show the distribution of total operating hours per day. Referring to the statistics and distribution, we considered that it would not be difficult to reduce the operating time of each indoor unit by approximately 80 min, and decided to apply our method with a constraint of C = 240 min for the total amount of improvement at a time. 3.3 Results 3.3.1 Pathway to achieve reductions for improvement All days were divided into eight layers by CD-DEA. E 1 is the first layer extracted and represents the data combination with the lowest input value, meaning that these data show the best operation. Next, E 2 through E 8 were extracted in sequence, with E 8 being the layer representing the days with the longest HVAC operation. Table 5 summarizes improvement target D M U j k * for every DMU j ∈ ∪ T < l ≤ L E l and the amount of input reduction required to achieve it. Because DMU 1, DMU 5, and DMU 23 are in E 1, there is no need to improve them. The en-dashes (−) indicate jumping over a layer. The 13th DMU, for example, belongs to the 8th layer and its day is July 26 (07\u201326). In this case, the DMU that can be achieved with a single move is 08\u201326 in layer 3. This improvement requires 107 min for unit A, 1 min for unit B, and 41 min for unit C, for a total of 141 min. A negative improvement, for example, the reduction of unit B of the 20th DMU, means increasing the value in the opposite direction. The last column name, Class, indicates the result of classifying each day in the manner described in subsection 2.4.3 using the reduction of operating minutes. The result of this classification is further tabulated and analyzed in subsection 3.3.2. Basically, it is assumed that this improvement will be considered once each day to estimate the energy saving potential, but if further improvement is possible, a second level of improvement can be considered. That means, for example, that August 26 is the 26th DMU and belongs to the 3rd layer E 3, and its target is 07\u201324 in the 2nd layer E 2. Similarly, the 26th DMU, July 24, can be further improved to 07\u201308 in the 1st layer E 1. By connecting the two, August 26 can be considered an improvement that ultimately refers to July 8. This exceeds the constrained value of the amount of improvement, but it can be combined in this way in some cases to make further comparisons. This is referred to in this paper as the second-stage improvement. For all of the DMUs in this table, the calculation shows that the amount of operating time that can be reduced by a single move corresponds to a reduction of approximately 7.5% of the total operating time. A rough estimate, which ignores factors such as heat load, shows that the same amount of reduction in electricity consumption of approximately 7.5% can be expected. 3.3.2 Clustering of pathways Table 6 gives the average value of each class of Table 5. According to the results, classes 1 and 3 demonstrate the typical improvement pattern, which means that there is a policy of greatly reducing only operating time on unit B or greatly reducing only operating time on units A and C. In contrast, class 4 is a pattern that increases the operating time of units A and B but greatly reduces the operating time of unit C. It seems difficult to improve the overall performance. This is useful for establishing a policy for selecting which indoor units to focus on and which unit differences to examine more carefully. 3.4 Validity of the results We used these results to brief the building owners, suggest possible control settings in their environments, and actually set them up. Then, we used the data showing the difference between 08-17 and 07\u201324, and a histogram of all the differences introduced in subsection 2.4.2. 3.4.1 Energy reduction strategies for unit A Fig. 16 shows that it is effective to add an automatic shutdown control between 8 p.m. and 4 a.m. because the value of that time period fluctuates from day to day. Also, Fig. 15 shows that the unit is always running during the daytime on the target day, which has less operating time, so it is doubtful that the unit is being used out of necessity. A survey by the owner revealed that the indoor unit is always switched on during the day. It is possible to encourage users to turn it off during lunch breaks or when they feel it is unnecessary. Although, it is impossible to stop its operation in the morning because of necessity, it is possible to introduce a shutdown control at 9 p.m. 3.4.2 Energy reduction strategies for unit B Fig. 18 shows that unit B is not turned off regularly because there is a difference during the night. Fig. 17 shows that it is difficult to reduce the operating time during the day because the time of day when the system is in operation may be more or less on any given day, which seems to indicate control according to need. In such cases, it may be more effective to relax the temperature setting (i.e., increase it during the cooling season). In this case, the system was set to send a stop signal at 8 p.m. 3.4.3 Energy reduction strategies for unit C Fig. 20 shows that the difference becomes large at around 8 p.m., so the owner should set a shutdown signal from this time to reduce energy consumption when the occupant forgets to turn off the unit. Fig. 19 shows the same pattern as Fig. 15, where the time when the unit has been running for 60 min should be checked to see if the operation is really necessary. A survey by the owner revealed that the users do not want to turn off the indoor equipment during the day, although there are certainly times when there is no need to operate it. In this case, the system was set to send a stop signal at 9 p.m. 3.5 Limitations of using the results of this method Basically the effective method in this case study was to include a shutdown control to turn the air conditioner off at night. The difference in operation in the morning was often due to necessity, but operation was not necessary at night. The unit in Fig. 17 was controlled according to need, but the unit in Fig. 15 was not. For this type of operating history, it is necessary to encourage users to improve their usage. This seems to be the limitation of this method of reducing energy consumption according to operating history. Evaluation based on differences in operating time cannot detect differences if the equipment is always switched on. Using compressor operating time can go so far as to detect differences, but actual control is impossible without real-time detection of the amount of heat processed and the presence of occupants. 4 Discussion 4.1 Findings from the case study By comparing the operating histories on a daily basis, it was possible to envelop the days of longer and shorter operation. As expected, this result showed the possibility of achieving shorter operating times by comparing the differences. This allowed us to determine what kind of controls would be most effective if set up on a centralized controller, and led to the actual introduction of control settings. Particularly effective was the nighttime operation stop signal. The specified constraint value C = 240 was able to reach the final target layer E 1 with at most three improvements, which avoid the zigzag path. This is because the constrained values determined from operating time statistics and other data were reasonable in this case. As a side benefit, we can see the candidates for the days that are considered to have ideal operation during the period. In other words, by looking at E 1, we can see what kind of operation the system had on the days that are considered to be good operation. If the operation of E 1 is sufficient as a target for improvement, the proposed method can be applied effectively. If the data belonging to E 1 have excessively long operating times, it is difficult to make improvements with this method. Such limitations of the present method are discussed in subsection 4.2. 4.2 Limitations Because our method assumes that there is a differential in operating times, it is difficult to find any further energy reduction potential if no differential occurs. As described in subsection 3.5, the start and end times of operation are often differential, and a scheduled stop signal was effective in controlling this. In other words, it was found that energy reduction can be effectively implemented, especially through daily operation shutdown times. In contrast, for daytime operations, it is possible to discern whether a day of good operation is being shut down as needed. For example, the July 24th operation of Fig. 17 can be determined as a good day of operation, where the on/off switch is operated as needed by the user. However, Fig. 15 can only present possible reductions because the switch is always on during the daytime and no differences occur. In this case, in buildings where strategies such as IBMS are not used, which is the subject of this paper, energy reduction is limited to advising users to turn off equipment if it is not needed. In this case, further reduction can be achieved by real-time control using, for example, motion sensors, and cannot be accomplished by methods based solely on operating history. 4.3 Robustness Because the DEA input is the total operating hours per day, the CD-DEA results are strongly influenced by whether the day represented unusual operation, rather than by detailed differences in usage at different times of the day. Such peculiar usage, such as holidays, can be suppressed by removing peculiar usage (outliers) from the data if the corresponding day is known. If it still cannot be suppressed, it can be avoided by choosing an appropriate target layer at the target layer selection stage. The other variable factor is C, which is the constraining value of the amount of improvement. Depending on the combination of constraints and data, improvement targets may not be found for some inefficient days. In this case, the day can be considered as a singularity that is not targeted when considering the improvement. In addition, depending on the data, the number of layers divided by CD-DEA may be large. In the case of incremental improvement from layer to layer, an increase in the number of layers implies an increase in the cost of improvement, but this method is not affected because the improvement target is calculated across layers. 5 Conclusions Previous studies used controlled HVAC systems through the coordination of motion sensors and other sensors to reduce energy consumption by limiting unnecessary operating time. In addition, if the environment is capable of smart control, such as IBMS, the operation time can be optimized for each user. However, such efforts are limited to buildings that can implement smart control. The main objective of this study was to identify energy reduction potential that can be discovered using only the operating history of air conditioning equipment to implement energy conservation measures for buildings without any additional sensors (and thus cannot employ IBMS). It can allow energy conservation measures to be applied to more buildings. Focusing on the different operating hours of air conditioning equipment on a daily basis, we considered that a day of operation that envelops the operating hours of each indoor unit could be a good example of good operation. Therefore, the proposed method is based on DEA. Existing studies of DEA application to building energy management have shown that it is important to exclude outliers, isolate uncontrollable factors, and not use ratio values (such as the EUI) as inputs, an our proposed method follows these precautions. However, existing research lacks a discussion of the feasibility of improvement, which is one of the challenges of DEA. The reason why this feasibility is important in this case is that reducing the operating time of air conditioning equipment may compromise user comfort. The feasibility of improvement has been investigated in the DEA research area. CD-DEA was used to create a hierarchy of frontiers and improve them step by step. However, the gradual improvement was seen as problematic because it caused the improvement path to zigzag, which was subsequently resolved in several ways. Our method used attractiveness and progress as indicators for selecting improvement candidates, and zigzagging was suppressed by allowing paths to cross layers within defined constraints. The combination of these indicators and the handling of pathways across layers is a new combination, and was devised in terms of which layer from which attractiveness and progress should be measured. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of such a method. In our case study, the method was actually applied to the VRF system in an office building, and it was shown that a single improvement could potentially reduce operating hours by about 7.5%. These reductions are specific to this case study only, as they vary by target building and system. Using the results obtained here, we further analyzed what differences we could find and used them to suggest to the building owner some effective automatic controls for the centralized controllers. After some discussion, it was decided that a control would be set up to automatically send a stop signal to each indoor unit at a specified time during the night. Through the case study, it was found that the potential for energy reduction based on operating time alone is limited to situations where a difference in operating time occurs. The easiest time to detect and effectively use this is at the end of each day. During the daytime, such operating times are difficult to detect because the equipment is operated throughout day and in this case, the survey found that no occupant was concerned about operating the HVAC equipment. Optimal operating times could not be discovered by this method without additional investigation, and even if optima were discovered, the environment could not be controlled to optimize its operation time. If it is possible to control the system in real time by using, for example, motion sensors, this operating time wasted during the day can be reduced. This is the limitation of our method and the range that smart control using IoT devices can cover. Although this method was applied to only one system, the factors that vary from system to system were discovered in section 4.3. All items were shown to be controllable by appropriate responses. As shown by the results presented above, the proposed method clarifies the energy reduction potential that can be discovered using only the operating history of the HVAC equipment, and shows where the limits of the energy reduction potential lie. Our method addressed the feasibility of improvements by incorporating the operational constraints of air conditioning units and presenting an acceptable improvement method in revealing them. This is the novelty of this study, and it will contribute to implementing energy conservation measures that are more acceptable to more buildings. For future studies, it will be interesting to see what points need to be considered when applying the system to systems other than VRF. In addition, if more detailed data were available, such as a history of the number of people in the room or heat load, the combined analysis would be expected to produce more effective results. From a different perspective, a similar argument could be made for the temperature setting instead of the operating time, and their control could be combined. Author statement Conceptualization: T.

        "dc:description": "Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems account for the bulk of a building's energy use, which means that potentially significant energy savings can be made by efficiently modifying how those systems are operated. Although several studies have demonstrated that optimizing the operation of HVAC equipment in combination with sensor readings can reduce potentially wasteful processes, such efforts are limited to buildings that have or can incorporate additional sensors. As an alternative approach, this paper aims to identify potentially wasted energy and provide suggested improvements for buildings that do not have installed sensors, which is important because such suggestions can extend the scope of energy reduction measures. More specifically, we hypothesized that comparing differences in user operations would make it possible to identify potentially wasteful operating times. Accordingly, we began our study by identifying target days and days for improvement using data envelopment analysis and then detected operational differences by comparing their operating times. Our new method was then applied to variable refrigerant flow systems in an office building as a case study. The obtained results showed that the potential for energy reduction was about 7.5%. These results, which helped determine the appropriate times for automatically shutting down each indoor unit, proved effective in implementing energy reduction measures. The novelty of this paper is that it clarified the energy waste that can be detected based on operating times, which is expected to lead to the development of additional options for energy reduction measures, thereby allowing building owners to implement more effective actions based on the sizes and conditions of their buildings.",
