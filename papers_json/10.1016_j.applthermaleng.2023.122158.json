An economizer system means that outside air is introduced to reduce energy consumption when the outdoor air is sufficient to be used for cooling, and adjusts the outdoor, ventilation, and exhaust damper to maintain the mixed air temperature set value during heating, ventilation and air conditioning control. The set values for economizer control include high and low limit that determine whether to operate economizer, and mixed air temperature. At this time, the mixed air temperature is set to a fixed value. Such a fixed set value may cause problems such as energy waste because it does not consider changes in indoor and outdoor environments. Therefore, in this study, an optimal economizer control was developed that produces the maximum economizer effect by resetting the mixed air temperature set value considering the indoor and outdoor conditions. For this, a data-driven prediction model was developed, and based on the prediction model, an optimal economizer control was developed that resetting the mixed air temperature set value. And the developed control was evaluated by TRNSYS-Matlab co-simulator, and as a result, the mixed air temperature set value was changed in real time, and energy consumption was reduced by about 20% compared to the dry-bulb temperature control.

Various efforts are being made to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from buildings in Korea. The government is promoting the strengthening of energy standards for new buildings, the activation of green remodeling of existing buildings, and phasing out zero-energy buildings. Most of the energy consumption of the building sector is consumed by the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems [1]. Maintenance and management are essential for sustaining the performance and energy management of HVAC system, and energy efficient measures of a HVAC system include system remodeling and operating method improvement. Buildings age and deteriorate over time, needing to be repaired to improve its performance and economic advancement. Moreover, it can save energy through system renovation [2,3]. Energy efficient measures of a HVAC system can contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. In accordance with the Green Building Support Act, the energy saving design standards for buildings operated as notified by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport set standards for the efficient management of buildings [4]. The Energy Performance Index (EPI) presented in this standard suggests a plan for energy efficient measures by remodeling and maintaining the HVAC system and improving the operation method. One of the index is the introduction of an economizer system. The economizer system reduces the cooling load by introducing outdoor air such as an intermediate period within the range that does not reduce indoor air quality (IAQ). It can be divided into passive and active elements. The economizer of the passive side is a plan to prevent incident heat from penetrating into the room from the design stage of a building and prevent the cooling load from occurring without the help of a mechanical system [5,6]. An active type of economizer refers to any technology that reduces the energy consumption of a cooling system or the running time of a cooling device when the outdoor air temperature is low to cool a data center or other facilities. Two types of economizers are applied to the HVAC system: water-side and air-side. A water-side economizer uses cold air to cool circulating cooling water an external cooling tower. An air-side economizer means that cold air from outdoors is introduced into the system and used for cooling. The economizer control applied to the HVAC system uses outdoor air for cooling by controlling the outdoor air, return and exhaust dampers to maintain the mixed air temperature set value when the outdoor air temperature or enthalpy is lower than the indoor air temperature or enthalpy [7]. Fig. 1 presents the conceptual diagram of the economizer system. A general control method of economizer includes dry-bulb temperature control, which determines the amount of outdoor air introduced based on the dry-bulb temperature, and enthalpy control, which determines the amount of outdoor air introduced based on temperature and enthalpy [8]. In addition, according to ASHRAE standard 90.1 (2016), it is classified into fixed and differential control depending on whether ventilation side information is considered [9]. Economizer control set values include a high and low limit that determines whether to operate the economizer and a mixed air temperature. ASHRAE standard 90.1 suggests the high and low limit according to the climatic conditions and the engineering equipment manual suggests a set value of 18 °C [9,10]. The damper is adjusted to maintain the set value of the mixed air temperature when controlling the HVAC system. The set value of the mixed air temperature is generally set to 13 °C. Hence, the set value for controlling the economizer is set to a constant value according to the user or manager\u2019s experience. When controlling the economizer, a fixed set value may cause problems such as energy waste because the indoor and outdoor environments are not considered. Bakke evaluated the effect of the low limit set-value on energy consumption during economizer operation. [11] Lee et al analyzed the energy saving effect according to the change in the set point of supply air temperature when controlling the economizer control. [12] Seong et al compared the control performance according to the economizer control method and set value change. [13] Gang et al developed a steady-state energy consumption model to derive the optimal supply temperature during economizer control of HVAC system. [14] Lee et al proposed a control method that resets the mixed temperature set value according to the load when controlling the economizer dry-bulb temperature control in CAV (Constant Air Volume) single duct system. [15] As such, the economizer control set value effects energy consumption, and many studies have been conducted on resetting the set value for optimal control. However, there is a lack of study on resetting the economizer control set value considering the real-time changing weather conditions, HVAC system load, and IAQ (Indoor Air Quality). In order to maximize the outdoor cooling effect during economizer control, it is necessary to reset the set value considering the indoor and outdoor conditions that change in real time. Therefore, this study propose an optimal economizer control by resetting the mixed air temperature set value. For optimal economizer control, it is necessary to predict and control the future state of the system based on the current state, but it is difficult to predict the future of the system. With the automation of buildings, technologies, such as big data and artificial intelligence, are being used as tools for predicting building energy consumption, predicting the performance of a HVAC system, and system optimization and real-time control by converging with building mechanical systems [16]. Among the data-driven models, machine learning models are attracting attention as a tool for developing prediction models in buildings. Machine learning is a branch of computer science that uses the knowledge gained through learning from experience to make future decisions. The goal of machine learning is to generalize observed patterns or to generate new rules from given examples. Machine learning is classified into supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning is a method of learning to determine the extraction of new inputs from input and output data and is divided into classification and regression techniques. Classification techniques include the Artificial Neural Network (ANN), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), and decision trees, and regression techniques include the ANN, Support Vector Machine (SVM), KNN, and Gaussian Process, etc. Unsupervised learning is a method of allocating observation values belonging to the same cluster to multiple similar subsets with respect to an appropriate criterion. Representative methods include clustering, compression, etc. In addition, reinforced learning means that a machine or agent learns behavior from feedback from its environment. [17]. ANNs were proposed by Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts in 1943 and are learning algorithms based on neural networks in biology. Machine learning using the ANN model analyzes large volume of data to discover certain rules. Accordingly, it has the strength to classify and predict, and it can make empirical inferences based on the learned data without a theoretical explanation. Therefore, when the data size is huge, and the relationship between input and output variables is unclear theoretically, it can be expected to improve the prediction accuracy through the application of machine learning. An ANN consists of an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. The input signal is transmitted in the order of the input layer, the hidden layer, and the output layer, which is a feed-forward propagation order. When the neurons composing each layer receive an input value from the outside, it is calculated as the sum of the values multiplied by the weight. Finally, the output value is derived by the transfer function. The derived output value appears different from the desired output value, and it is propagated in the reverse direction after the back-propagation process to adjust the connection strength of each layer and derive the desired value. The learning rule for connection strength is applied using the gradient descent method, so that the error is minimized. Xu et al. developed a heating and cooling load prediction model of a residential building using the MLP neural network model. This study optimized the MLP neural network model through various optimization algorithms [18]. Sholahudin S. et al. predicted the heating load using a dynamic neural network model for a HVAC system operation and confirmed that the dynamic neural network model accurately predicts the instantaneous heating load with a small number of input variables. [19] Kwon et al. proved that it is possible to predict the cooling load of a large building with a stable matching rate through an ANN model. Based on the predicted cooling load, it is applied to a refrigerator of a large building and can reduce cooling energy and production costs [20]. Kallio et al. developed an indoor carbon dioxide concentration prediction model using machine learning for building energy efficiency through stable prediction of indoor environmental changes. They evaluated the prediction accuracy of the developed model and the effects of various sensors [21]. Kim et al. developed an indoor carbon dioxide concentration prediction model using machine algorithms (ANN, Random Forest (RF), SVM, KNN) by utilizing data from five points to control and monitor the VAV terminal unit of the HVAC system and evaluate it. As a result of the evaluation, the relative error between the measured value and the predicted value occurred within approximately 5 %, and the performance of the ANN model among the machine learning models was excellent [22]. Guang et al. developed a neural network model based on ESNs to predict the energy consumption of office buildings [23]. Kim et al. developed an ANN model, a SMV model, and a GP model to predict the energy consumption of an actual office building. They compared and analyzed the performance of the three models [24]. Mocanu et al. developed an energy consumption prediction model using several machine learning techniques such as neural network, Boltzmann machine learning, and SVR, and derived an optimal model [25]. Kang et al. developed a cooling energy usage prediction model of the VRF system using ANNs. A performance evaluation confirmed that the accuracy of the prediction model satisfies the evaluation criteria [26]. Lee et al. developed a total energy consumption prediction model of a building using ANN to derive the optimal supply temperature of the HVAC system in real-time [27]. Therefore, technologies, such as big data and artificial intelligence, are being used as tools for predicting building energy consumption, system optimization, and real-time control. In addition, ANNs, among data-driven models, can predict nonlinear patterns with excellent performance. Hence, it can be used for building load and energy prediction. This study developed an optimal control method that produces the maximum outdoor air cooling effect when operating an economizer system. To this end, this study developed a data-driven prediction model and optimal control to predict the optimal mixed air temperature set value using the developed prediction model and evaluated the control method through simulation. This study used MATLAB to develop the prediction model, and TRNSYS 17, a dynamic simulation tool, was used to evaluate the economizer control performance. [28,29] In addition, a co-simulation between TRNSYS 17 and MATLAB was constructed and used to evaluate the optimal economizer control. 2 Methodology Economizer control, which is one of the energy efficient measures of buildings, adjusts outdoor air, return, and exhaust dampers to maintain a mixed air temperature set value. When controlling the economizer dry-bulb temperature control, the mixed air temperature is typically set to a constant 13 °C. If it is not controlled to an appropriate set value considering the indoor and outdoor conditions of the buildings, energy waste may occur, and set value automation considering indoor and outdoor conditions is required. Among the data-driven modes, ANNs can predict nonlinear patterns with excellent performance. Therefore, it is used in the building sector, such as building load and energy prediction. For optimal control of the economizer, it is necessary to predict and control the future state of the system based on the current state, but it is difficult to predict the future of the system. Hence, it is necessary to control the economizer optimally using an ANN model. Using an ANN model, this study developed an optimal economizer control that satisfies indoor thermal comfort and IAQ and consumes minimum energy and Fig. 2 shows the research flow. 2.1 Target building and modelling condition The target building selected for this study was a university laboratory located in Korea, with an area of 77.8 m2. Table 1 shows an overview of the target building and system, in which a single duct VAV system and terminal unit with reheat coil are installed in the target building. The simulation program selected in this study was TRNSYS 17, a detailed building analysis program in which a user connects the components and performs the simulation. For simulation through TRNSYS 17, the target building was 3D modeled using the Google Sketch-up program. The architectural elements of the building were modeled through TRNbuild, and the mechanical system was modeled with a simulation studio. This study used data from \u2018Ulsan\u2019 among the climate data provided by TRNSYS, and Ulsan is one of the regions in Korea. The indoor temperature and relative humidity were set to 24 °C and 50 %, respectively, according to the indoor temperature and relative humidity standards for calculating the capacity of the heating and cooling mechanical system in the energy-saving design standards of buildings. Table 2 lists the modeling conditions. 3 Development of prediction model 3.1 Analysis of related elements This study use a data-driven model for optimal economizer control. The factors affecting the mixed air temperature through related theoretical analysis were derived to selecting a prediction model. That is, the relationship between the mixed air temperature, the load, and the outdoor air intake ratio was analyzed to derive the mixed air temperature set value considering the weather conditions and the HVAC system load when controlling the economizer. (1) Mixed air temperature and the load The first law of thermodynamics describes the conservation of energy for a system, and it can be expressed as equation (1). If equation (1) is expressed as a rate of change, it can be expressed as equation (2). The total energy of the system is given by equation (3). (1) δ Q - δ W = d E (2) Q ̇ - W ̇ = dE dt system (3) E system = ∫ M ( s y s t e m ) e d m + ∫ ∀ ( s y s t e m ) e ρ d ∀ Based on the equations for the system and the control volume, the control volume for the first law of thermodynamics can be expressed using equations (4) and (5). (4) dE dt system = ∂ ∂ t ∫ CV e ρ d V + ∫ CS e ρ V → ∙ dA → (5) Q ̇ - W ̇ = ∫ CS ( u + p v + 1 2 V 2 + g z ) ρ V → ∙ dA → Enthalpy of a substance is a complex energy for internal energy per unit mass and flow work, and it can be expressed as equation (6). The general process of state change through equations (5) and (6) can be expressed as equations (7) and (8). (6) h = u + p v (7) Q ̇ - W ̇ = ∫ CS ( h + 1 2 V 2 + g z ) ρ V → ∙ dA → (8) Q ̇ = W ̇ + h 1 + 1 2 V 1 2 + g z 1 - ρ 1 V 1 A 1 + h 2 + 1 2 V 2 2 + g z 2 ρ 2 V 2 A 2 In the state of steady flow, the law of mass conservation is as equation (9) and can be expressed as equation (10). Based on this, equation (8) can be expressed as equation (11). (9) ∫ CS ρ V → ∙ d A → = 0 (10) ρ 1 V 1 A 1 = ρ 2 V 2 A 2 = m ̇ (11) Q ̇ = W ̇ + m ̇ h 2 - h 1 + 1 2 ( V 2 2 - V 1 2 ) Based on equation (11), the energy equation in the air conditioning process of a HVAC system in a steady flow state can be expressed as (12). (12) ∑ Q S ̇ + ∑ Q L ̇ = m ̇ h 2 - h 1 When controlling the economizer, the supply air can be expressed as mixed air. Based on this, equation (12) can be expressed as equation (13) by expressing the relationship between the supply air and the indoor load. (13) ∑ Q S ̇ + ∑ Q L ̇ = m ̇ h mix - h ra When the fluid is an ideal gas with constant specific heat, the enthalpy of water vapor can be expressed as equation (14). This shows that the sensible and latent heat loads are related to the mixed air temperature and absolute humidity during economizer control. (14) h = c pa t + x ( c pw t + h g 0 ) (2) Mixed air temperature and the amount of outdoor air intake According to the law of conservation of mass, the mixture of outdoor air and return air can be expressed as equation (15). When controlling the HVAC system, the required ventilation amount of the indoor zone should be considered and it can be calculated using equation (16) presented in ASHRAE standard 62.1 [30]. The required ventilation amount calculated in the equation (16) is equal to the amount of outdoor air introduction. Based on this, the mixed air temperature can be expressed as equation (17) by considering the required ventilation amount of the indoor zone when controlling the economizer. (15) m mix T mix = m oa T oa + m ra T ra (16) m oz = R P × P + ( R a × A ) E z (17) T mix = m oz T oa m mix + ( m mix - m oz ) T ra m mix The mixed air temperature set value is related to the sensible and latent heat loads and the amount of outdoor air intake. The amount of outdoor air intake is related to the indoor carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration. Accordingly, it is necessary to develop a sensible and latent heat load and indoor CO2 concentration prediction model for optimal economizer control. 3.2 Development of ANN model In this study, the sensible and latent heat load, indoor CO2 concentration, and energy consumption prediction model were developed to predict the optimal mixed air temperature. The prediction model development proceeded in the order of learning data collection, input variable selection, initial model development, prediction model optimization, and prediction model development and validation, as shown in Fig. 3 . For the accurate prediction performance of the ANN model, the training data required for developing the prediction model was collected through TRNSYS 17 simulation. To develop prediction model, the data was collected by changing the mixed air temperature set value from 10 °C to 24 °C at intervals of 1 °C, and the number of occupants from zero to four people at intervals of one person. The input variables of the prediction model were selected through the analysis of the Pearson correlation coefficient and the coefficient of determination of the collected data and the predicted data. MATLAB 2014a and the functions built into the program were used to develop the prediction model. Among the training data sets constructed during the prediction model, 70 % of randomly selected data was used for training, 15 % was used as validation data, and the remaining 15 % was used as test data. The data of the constructed input variables have different ranges. In addition, units and the structure of the hidden layer of the initial ANN model developed was composed of 1 layer and 2n + 1 hidden neurons [31]. To improve the learning and prediction performance of the ANN by minimizing the weight bias when learning the prediction model using the training data set, a normalization process was performed to replace the data value between 0 and 1. In addition, an optimization model was derived by optimizing the number of hidden layers and the number of hidden neurons. A prediction model was developed based on the derived optimal hidden layer composition, and the performance of the developed prediction model was evaluated by the Mean Bias Error (MBE), CV(RMSE) (Coefficient of Variation of the Root Mean Square Error) and R2, and the evaluation results are as follows. The MBE of the sensible heat load prediction model was 5.07 % and the CV(RMSE) was 9.08 %, and R2 was 0.96 and the latent heat load prediction model showed corresponding values of 9.89 %, 22.14 %, and 0.92 respectively. In addition, the indoor CO2 concentration prediction model showed that MBE was 9.19 %, CV(RMSE) was 14.03 % and R2 was 0.86. The performance values of the energy prediction model showed that MBE was 5.69 %, 8.03 %, and 4.77 % for the cooling, fan, and reheating energy prediction models, respectively, and the CV(RMSE) values were 26.31 %, 12.08 %, and 7.17 % for all developed models. In addition, R2 was 0.99, 0.93, and 0.99. It was confirmed that the prediction model performance satisfies the criteria of ASHRAE Guideline 14 [32], and Table 3 listed the composition of the prediction model developed in this study. 4 Propose of prediction model-based optimal economizer control In conventional economizer control, mixed air temperature is set constant. If the economizer control is not controlled to an appropriate set value in consideration of the indoor and outdoor conditions of the building, energy waste can occur. Therefore, it is necessary to automate the set value considering indoor and outdoor conditions. The mixed air temperature is related to the building load and IAQ. Therefore, by predicting the building load and indoor CO2 concentration, optimal economizer control was developed to satisfy indoor thermal comfort and IAQ and minimize energy consumption. Based on the previously developed ANN model, this study predicted the optimal mixed air temperature that consumes the minimum energy. The optimal control for the economizer was developed using this. Fig. 4 shows the control algorithm, and the detailed control method is as follows: Step 1: Predicting sensible and latent heat loads and CO2 concentration based on the operational data. Step 2: Predicting energy consumption based on mixed air temperature and predicted sensible heat load, latent heat load and CO2 concentration Step 3: Derivation of set value for mixed air temperature of the economizer control under a minimum energy consumption situation Step 4: Apply the derived set value as the economizer control set value of the next time-step. 4.1 Co-simulation In this study, TRNSYS 17, a simulation program, was used to evaluate the performance of the developed economizer control algorithm. For this, co-simulation between TRNSYS 17 and MATLAB was constructed. The factors required for prediction are passed form TRNSYS to Matlab, and after prediction is made in Matlab, the optimal mixed air temperature set value resulting from the prediction is passed back to TRNSYS. That is, Input values (the outdoor air temperature, outdoor air humidity, outdoor air intake ratio, and supply air flow rate) used for prediction were transmitted from TRNSYS to MATLAB, and the sensible and latent heat loads, IAQ, and energy consumption are predicted. A prediction model was used to derive a mixed air temperature set value in a situation where energy consumption in minimal and the derived set value is transmitted to TRNSYS to be applied as a mixed air temperature set value in the next step. Data is transmitted at intervals of 1 min, and Fig. 5 shows the simulation configuration. 5 Results and discussion In this study, TRNSYS 17 and MATLAB\u2019s co-simulator were used to evaluate the proposed optimal economizer control. The change in the mixed air temperature set value according to the application of the developed control were reviewed. Also, the indoor thermal comfort and energy consumption were evaluated along with the existing economizer dry-bulb temperature control. At this time, the set value for controlling the economizer dry-bulb temperature control was set as follows. The mixed air temperature set value was 13 °C, and the high limit for economizer was 18 °C. That is, economizer control is performed when the outdoor air temperature is below 18 °C. When the corresponding climate data is used, it is possible to operate with an economizer for 5,531 h per year. Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 shows the distribution results of mixed air temperature (MAT) set-value according to the application of the optimal economizer control. When the optimal economizer control was applied, the set value of the mixed air temperature changed continuously with time according to application of optimal economizer control. In addition, the annual average indoor air temperature (IAT) was 22.59 °C, and the year-round IAQ was within ± 2 °C. And the indoorrelative humidity (IRH) was maintained below 60% (Fig. 6). Fig. 7 shows the year-round time of the mixed air temperature set value according to the economizer optimal control. During the year, the mixed air temperature set-value was 24 °C the most, followed by 13, 22, and 23 °C. Figs. 8\u201310 show the evaluation results of energy consumption according to the application of control method. Fig. 8 shows the evaluation results of the cooling energy consumption. According to the application of the optimal control, cooling energy consumption was saved in all cooling periods. The amount of savings was the largest in June. The annual cooling energy consumption was 76,882,254 kJ when the existing control was applied. And the energy consumption according to the optimal control was applied was 40,208,167 kJ, which saved 33,272,902 kJ. This is judged to be the result of the increase in the cooling section through outdoor air as the mixed air temperature set value is reset in consideration of indoor and outdoor conditions. Fig. 9 shows the evaluation results of fan energy consumption. According to the application of the optimal economizer control, about 929,696 kJ of energy was saved compared to the existing control method. This result is due to the change in supply air volume to satisfy the load of the zone as the mixed air temperature set value changes. Fig. 10 shows the reheating energy consumption. Most of the time in the winter, the mixed air temperature set value was set higher compared to the conventional control method, which reduced reheating energy consumption. Energy savings in January were the largest at 7,961,743 kJ, and energy savings by reheat energy during the year were about 21,930,320 kJ. Fig. 11 presents the total energy consumption by month and by control method. As the result of monthly analysis, energy savings were the largest in January, and the savings were 7,873,598 kJ. And the energy saving in March was the smallest and the value was 12,608 kJ. The fan energy consumption according to the optimal economizer control was 11,110,360 kJ and reheating energy consumption was 7,292,781 kJ. And cooling energy consumption was 40,208,167 kJ, which accounted for the highest proportion in the total energy consumption, accounting for 68.6 %. The total energy consumption according to the dry-bulb temperature control is 118,146,411 kJ, and the total energy consumption according to the optimal economizer control is 58,611,308 kJ. Compared to the existing control method, about 50.4 % of reduction effect is achieved according to the optimal control. According to the resetting of the mixed air temperature set value considering the indoor and outdoor conditions proposed in this study, the annual cooling energy was reduced by about 47.7 %, and the fan energy consumption and reheating energy consumption were reduced by 7.7 % and 75.0 %, respectively. As a result, total annual energy consumption was reduced by about 50.4 %. In this way, it is judged that energy can be saved through optimal economizer control by resetting the mixed air temperature set value using a data-driven prediction model. The purpose of this study is to develop an optimal economizer control by resetting the mixed air temperature for maximum cooling effect. By applying the developed control method, the mixed air temperature set-point was changed according to indoor and outdoor conditions, and annual energy consumption was reduced compared to existing control methods. This is because the result of an increased in the 100 % outdoor air cooling due to changes in mixed air temperature during the cooling season. In addition, compared to the existing control in winter, the mixed air temperature set value appears higher, resulting in a decrease in reheating energy consumption. At this time, when the mixed air temperature increases compared to the existing control method, energy consumption by the fan increases, but the effect of the fan on annual energy consumption is very small. Therefore, it is believed that additional energy savings will be possible by resetting the control set value in real time, taking into account the indoor and outdoor environment, rather than using fixed values. In the future, verification through demonstration is necessary for the developed control method. 6 Conclusion In this study, the optimal economizer control was developed that produces the maximum outdoor air cooling effect. To this, a data-driven prediction model was developed. Optimal control was developed by predicting the mixed air temperature set value, and the control method developed was evaluated using TRNSYS-Matlab\u2019s co-simulation. The results of this study are as follows. This study developed a data-driven load, indoor CO2 concentration, and energy prediction model to predict the mixed air temperature set-value for optimal economizer control, and MATLAB was used for this. The performance evaluation results of the developed prediction model, the MBE of the sensible heat load prediction model was 5.07 % and the CV(RMSE) was 9.08 %, and the latent heat load prediction model showed corresponding values of 9.89 % and 22.14 %, respectively. And the indoor CO2 concentration prediction model showed that MBE was 9.19 % and CV(RMSE) was 14.03 %. The performance values of the energy prediction model are as follows. The MBE of the prediction model for cooling, fan and reheating energy was 5.69 %, 8.03 %, and 4.77 %, and the CV(RMSE) was 26.31 %, 12.08 %, and 7.17 %, respectively. Using the previously developed data-driven prediction model, an optimal control was developed to reset the mixed air temperature set-point when controlling the economizer. And the developed control was evaluated through Matlab and TRNSYS\u2019s co-simulator. With the application of developed control, the mixed air temperature setting was changed in real time, and the indoor temperature was satisfied within ± 2 °C. And when compared with the existing dry-bulb temperature control in terms of energy, the total annual energy consumption was reduced by about 50.4 %.

        "dc:description": "An economizer system means that outside air is introduced to reduce energy consumption when the outdoor air is sufficient to be used for cooling, and adjusts the outdoor, ventilation, and exhaust damper to maintain the mixed air temperature set value during heating, ventilation and air conditioning control. The set values for economizer control include high and low limit that determine whether to operate economizer, and mixed air temperature. At this time, the mixed air temperature is set to a fixed value. Such a fixed set value may cause problems such as energy waste because it does not consider changes in indoor and outdoor environments. Therefore, in this study, an optimal economizer control was developed that produces the maximum economizer effect by resetting the mixed air temperature set value considering the indoor and outdoor conditions. For this, a data-driven prediction model was developed, and based on the prediction model, an optimal economizer control was developed that resetting the mixed air temperature set value. And the developed control was evaluated by TRNSYS-Matlab co-simulator, and as a result, the mixed air temperature set value was changed in real time, and energy consumption was reduced by about 20% compared to the dry-bulb temperature control.",
