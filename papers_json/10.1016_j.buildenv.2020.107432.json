Dalian University of Technology 2# Ling Gong RD Dalian Liaoning Province 116023 China The automatic control of the existing indoor thermal environment is usually based on the user's set points without considering their real-time thermal feeling, causing an uncomfortable thermal environment and high energy consumption. In this study, the wristband device's physiological data is utilized to propose a thermal sensation prediction-based fuzzy control method of indoor temperature to improve the indoor environment's thermal comfort and achieve an energy saving of air-conditioning system. The linear regression model-based updating method is utilized to update the thermal sensation prediction model in real-time. Moreover, Mamdani fuzzy model and FFSI method are adopted to develop the fuzzy control algorithm for indoor temperature set point optimization. Several comparative experiments are performed to compare control performance, thermal comfort, and energy consumption of thermal sensation prediction-based control with thermal sensation feedback-based control and temperature set point-based control. The results show that thermal sensation prediction-based control can adjust the temperature set point by monitoring physiological data from the subjects without interfering with their regular works. It is also revealed that the thermal comfort performance of thermal sensation prediction-based control is superior to the temperature set point-based control, while it is similar to the thermal sensation feedback-based control. Furthermore, the proposed control approach provides 20.07% and 10.73% savings in daily energy consumption compared with the temperature set point-based control and thermal sensation feedback-based control, respectively. Keywords Indoor temperature control Fuzzy control Thermal comfort Energy consumption Thermal sensation prediction Wristband device 1 Introduction Building environment is an essential part of the human living environment since people spend about 90% of their time living indoors [1]. Building thermal environment is not only related to people's thermal comfort and physical health but also affects building energy consumption and resource sustainable development. The Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system, which provides a comfortable thermal environment, is the fundamental part of the building energy consumption [2]. The automatic control of the HVAC system is necessary for the energy efficiency improvement of buildings. In large public buildings, the indoor temperature is usually controlled at the predefined set points adjusted by thermostat for air-conditioning control. Although the mentioned method is simple and easy to implement, several problems may occur. The first problem is that the thermostat's temperature set points are casual and always unreasonable, leading to low and high temperatures in summer and winter, respectively [3]. Moreover, since most of the thermostats are installed on the wall or near the door, they only can measure the air temperature near these places rather than the air-conditioning area where the user is located. In other words, the air-conditioning system is controlled according to the temperature near the door instead of the air-conditioning area temperature. The above problems indicate that the regulation performance of air-conditioning terminal equipment is not compatible with the actual human thermal sensation, leading to an uncomfortable indoor thermal environment and high energy consumption of the air-conditioning system. On the other hand, with the rapid development of artificial intelligence and intelligent building, air-conditioning systems provide a comfortable, healthy, convenient, high efficiency, and energy-saving indoor environment for occupants. When the users cannot adjust a comfortable indoor temperature and do not like to readjust indoor temperature artificially and frequently, the temperature set point should be automatically and reasonably adjusted through the building control system regarding the real-time human thermal sensation [4,5]. Therefore, the human thermal sensation should be considered into the control logic of air-conditioning control systems to realize their intelligent and energy-saving performance. The Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) model proposed by Fanger in 1972 has been utilized by the researchers to study and evaluate the indoor environment thermal comfort and human thermal sensation [6]. Simultaneously, relevant studies demonstrated a considerable difference between the calculated results of the PMV model and the actual thermal sensation [7]. Therefore, the PMV model-based indoor thermal environment control has been rarely employed in actual engineering projects. Considering the mobile communication technology developments, an indoor thermal environment control method has been proposed in the literature by using smartphones to feedback on the real-time thermal sensation and location information of users to the air-conditioning control system [8\u201312]. According to the research results, superior thermal comfort and energy-saving could be attained for the air-conditioning system through the thermal sensation feedback-based method [10,12]. However, this method requires manually inputting the real-time thermal sensation and location information of the users, which significantly interferes with their regular work and life. When users fail to timely feedback on their thermal sensation, it is not easy to ensure the indoor thermal environment's control effect. Subsequently, researchers have employed human thermal sensation prediction to propose an indoor thermal environment control method, which can overcome the thermal sensation feedback-based control limitations. Physiological data such as skin temperature [13\u201320] and heart rate [21,22] have been adopted to predict thermal sensation. Due to the human body privacy, the real-time monitoring of the skin temperature in most parts of the body is complicated. Thus, the facial temperature has been measured by infrared images to predict human thermal sensation and realize the control of HVAC systems [23\u201325]. However, this method has limited and unstable accuracy when the user is in a low light environment or motion state. The smart wristband can monitor human physiological data such as wrist skin temperature and heart rate, which can predict human thermal sensation [18,20,22,26,27]. However, few studies have been devoted to applying physiological data extracted from the wristband device to automatic control of the air-conditioning system. In Ref. [28], the wearable device has been employed to collect human physiological data and constructed a smartphone application framework to determine the thermostat set point dynamically. In Refs. [29], the wrist skin temperature and heart rate data have been collected to predict human thermal sensation using a smart wristband and developed a linear algorithm to determine the indoor temperature set point. An HVAC control system has been developed in Ref. [30] for automatic adjustment of the indoor set point using the skin temperature and heart rate collected from the wristband and validated the developed control system through experiments and numerical simulations in multi-occupant offices. The previous studies prove that thermal comfort and energy saving could be improved using the wristband-based smart control method [28\u201330]. However, the intelligent control algorithm for automatic adjustment of the indoor temperature set point should be further studied, and comparative experiments should be performed to compare the performance of the wristband-based control, thermal sensation feedback-based control, and temperature set point-based control methods. Therefore, this study is devoted to developing and experimental verification of an intelligent control method for indoor temperature set point adjustment using a wristband device to improve thermal comfort and energy saving. To achieve this goal, a wristband device is adopted to collect wrist skin temperature and heart rate from occupants for predicting human thermal sensation. Then, an updating method is developed to update the thermal sensation prediction model in real-time. After that, a fuzzy control algorithm is proposed for indoor temperature set point optimization, while several experiments are performed in multi-occupant offices to evaluate the performance of the mentioned algorithm. This study evaluates the feasibility and effectiveness of the thermal sensation-based control method. It compares the control performance, thermal comfort, and energy consumption of temperature set point-based control, thermal sensation feedback-based control, and thermal sensation prediction-based control methods. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the basic theory of the thermal sensation prediction-based control method, including the control framework, model updating method, fuzzy control algorithm, and experimental procedure. The analysis and experimental results are given in Section 3. Section 4 discusses the obtained results and presents some limitations, as well. Conclusions are presented in Section 5. 2 Methodology 2.1 Control logic and control framework In the traditional indoor temperature control process, the indoor temperature is kept within a reasonable range by the controller by measuring the deviation between the set point and the actual indoor temperature. However, it is not easy to find a reasonable indoor temperature set point during the actual control process. Satisfying the thermal comfort using a fixed temperature set point based control is difficult, and the users should adjust the temperature set point actively and continuously to meet their thermal comfort requirements. The thermal sensation prediction-based control method is developed in this work to solve the above problems. Since the indoor temperature affects the human physiological data, it is feasible to acquire the skin temperature and heart rate from wristband devices to predict human thermal sensation [26\u201330]. The thermal sensation prediction-based control method employs the previous temperature set point and predicted thermal sensation to optimize the indoor temperature set point. The schematic diagram of the thermal sensation prediction-based control loop is shown in Fig. 1 . The control framework of the thermal sensation prediction-based control system is shown in Fig. 2 . The control system consists of a wristband, smartphone, terminal boxes, sensors, database, controller, and human-machine interface (HMI). Collecting the physiological parameters that can predict thermal sensation and transmit the data to the air-conditioning control system is the crucial factor for realizing the thermal sensation prediction-based control. Therefore, the most critical system component is the application (APP) interface on the smartphone, employing to receive data by connecting the wristband via Bluetooth and uploading data to the database. Simultaneously, the system also should integrate the indoor temperature setting functions and thermal sensation vote to compare and analyze the advantages and disadvantages of the thermal sensation prediction-based control, thermal sensation feedback-based control, and temperature set point-based control. The APP interface on the smartphone is shown in Fig. 2. The monitored skin temperature and heart rate data can be displayed on the APP interface and transferred to the database in real-time to realize the thermal sensation prediction based-control system. To compare the thermal sensation prediction-based control with thermal sensation feedback-based control and temperature set point-based control, the APP interface should set the indoor temperature set point and input thermal sensation vote to realize temperature set point-based control and thermal sensation feedback-based control, respectively. The thermal sensation vote is acquired from the ASHRAE 7-points scale: cold (−3), cool (−2), slightly cool (−1), neutral (0), slightly warm (+1), warm (+2), and hot (+3). The users also can express their satisfaction with the indoor environment through the satisfaction vote module. The satisfaction score consists of seven levels: very dissatisfied (1), dissatisfied (2), slightly dissatisfied (3), neutral (4), slightly satisfied (5), satisfied (6), and very satisfied (7). 2.2 Online monitoring and model updating of thermal sensation The psychological data from the wristband device can predict the real-time thermal sensation as an input parameter of the thermal sensation prediction control logic. The wrist skin temperature and heart rate obtained from the wristband device have been utilized to predict the human thermal sensation in our previous work [26]. According to Refs. [26], the linear regression model can be described as (1) T S = a + b T wsk + c D wsk + d H R where TS indicates the predicted thermal sensation, Twsk represents the wrist skin temperature, Dwsk describes the time differential of the wrist skin temperature, HR represents the heart rate, while the constants a, b, c, and d denote the regression coefficients of the estimation model. Thus, the human thermal sensation can be obtained using the physiological data acquired from the wristband device. Due to changes in physical conditions, psychological variations, and environmental conditions, the model parameters may vary around their nominal values, leading to instability in the model prediction results in the actual application process. Therefore, using a small amount of actual data to update the thermal sensation prediction model online significantly affects the accuracy and universality of the prediction model and makes the prediction model closer to the individuals\u2019 real situation. The error between actual and physical model parameters should be reduced to improve the thermal sensation prediction model. Using a small amount of actual data for updating the thermal sensation prediction model reflects the actual relationship between the thermal sensation and physiological parameters and provides accurate and reliable input parameters in automatic control of the air conditioning system. Therefore, a linear regression model-based updating method is proposed to realize the real-time updating of the thermal sensation prediction model. When k sets of data filter the thermal sensation estimation model, the following equation can be obtained (2) Y k = B k X k where Y k and X k are the output and input composed of k output and input values of the system, respectively, and B k is the vector composed of the regression coefficients. According to the least-squares estimation method, a set of estimates of B k should be obtained such that the following sum of squares of residuals is minimized (3) Q ( B ˆ k ) = ( Y k − X k B ˆ k ) T ( Y k − X k B ˆ k ) To minimize (3), its relative derivative with respect to B ˆ k should be equal to zero. Thus, we have (4) ∂ Q ( B ˆ k ) ∂ B ˆ k = − 2 X k T Y k + 2 X k T X k B ˆ k = 0 From (4), B ˆ k can be calculated as (5) B ˆ k = ( X k T X k ) − 1 X k T Y k When a new data set is added, the independent variable is chosen as x k+1=(1, T wsk(k+1), D wsk(k+1), H R(k+1)), while the dependent variable is y k+1. Thus, the fitting formula can be written as (6) Y k + 1 = X k + 1 B k + 1 According to the extreme principle, B k+1 can be calculated as (7) B ˆ k + 1 = ( X k + 1 T X k + 1 ) − 1 X k + 1 T Y k + 1 If one data set is added, all data should be considered to estimate B ˆ k + 1 , which increases the computational complexity. Therefore, equation (7) should be further simplified. Define G k+1 as (8) G k + 1 = ( X k T X k ) − 1 x k + 1 [ 1 + x k + 1 T ( X k T X k ) − 1 x k + 1 ] − 1 Now, equation (8) can be rewritten as (9) B ˆ k + 1 = B ˆ k + G k + 1 ( y k + 1 − x k + 1 T B ˆ k ) Considering given values for B ˆ k and X k in the original model, only a small number of calculations are required to obtain B ˆ k + 1 . This method continuously modifies the thermal sensation prediction model based on the measured data to make the prediction results closer to the real human situation. As shown in Fig. 3 , the thermal sensation prediction model updating algorithm consists of the following four steps: Step 1: Use the original data to establish the initial linear regression model and obtain Bk, Xk, and root mean square error (RMSE) of the initial model. Step 2: Calculate the predicted value using the regression model obtained in the first stage after a new input data set is added, and calculate the residual between the predicted and actual values. Step 3: Compare the absolute residual value with the RMSE of the predicted model. If this value is less than the mentioned RMSE, the new data set matches the original model; otherwise, the new data set does not match the original model, and the data set is recorded as some mismatches. Step 4: Compare the cumulative number of mismatches n with the given threshold value m. If n < m, the model cannot be updated and return to Step 2; otherwise, update the model using all the unmatched data set, and return to Step 2. 2.3 Fuzzy control algorithm of indoor temperature set point optimization Since the individual thermal sensation was calculated, the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method [29] was employed to calculate the group thermal sensation (GTS) of multi-occupant. Frequent adjustment of the indoor temperature set point may lead to instability of the air-conditioning system. The group thermal sensation's variation range should be employed instead of the zero value of the group thermal sensation as a set point reference for the optimal adjustment of the indoor temperature set point. Therefore, in the process of the indoor temperature set point optimization, the calculated value of group thermal sensation is between −0.5 and 0.5 as the optimal region of group thermal sensation, while its central value is the optimal group thermal sensation. The indoor temperature set point optimization can be described as (10) t SO = { t S + Δ t G T S < − 0.5 or G T S > 0.5 t S − 0.5 ≤ G T S ≤ 0.5 (11) Δ t = f u z z y ( e , e c ) where t SO is the optimal temperature set point, t S is the temperature set point before optimization, Δt is the adjustment quantity of indoor temperature set point, GTS is the group thermal sensation, e is the difference between the calculated group thermal sensation and its optimal value, ec is the deviation change between the current and previous moments. If e > 0 and ec > 0, the group thermal sensation of all users is warm with a warmer feeling compared with the last moment. To achieve a relaxed state quickly, the indoor temperature set point should be decreased, while Δt should take a large value. If e > 0 and ec < 0, the group thermal sensation of all users is warm, with a little cool feeling than the last moment. To attain a relaxed state as soon as possible, the indoor temperature set point should be decreased, while Δt should have a small value to avoid the indoor temperature set point too low to make users feeling cold. When e < 0 and ec > 0, all users' group thermal sensation is cool with a warmer feeling compared with the last moment. To realize a comfortable state rapidly, the indoor temperature set point should be increased, while Δt should take a small value to avoid a too high indoor temperature set point, which provides a hot feeling for users. If e < 0 and ec < 0, the group thermal sensation of all users is cool with a colder feeling compared with the last moment. To attain a comfortable state as soon as possible, the indoor temperature set point should be increased, while Δt should have a large value. In the indoor temperature set point optimization method based on Mamdani fuzzy model, the deviation e and its variations ec are considered as input variables, while the temperature set point adjustment quantity u is selected as the output variable. Finally, the following group of fuzzy rule statements can be obtained (12) if e is A i , and ec is B j , then u = C ij where A i , B j , and C ij represent the fuzzy subsets of deviation, deviation variation, and output, respectively. The fuzzy theory domain for e and ec is considered as [-3, +3], which is divided into seven fuzzy levels, including Negative Big (NB), Negative Medium (NM), Negative Small (NS), Zero (ZE), Positive Small (PS), Positive Medium (PM), and Positive Big (PB). The fuzzy rules for output adjustment of the indoor temperature set point are presented in Table 1 . In this paper, a triangle membership function is considered. The corresponding membership degrees for any calculated values of e and ec can be obtained through the single value membership method. The advanced control algorithms can improve the effectiveness and practicability of indoor temperature [31]. The Functioning fuzzy subset inference (FFSI) considers the fuzzy subset and fuzzy rules of the actual measured value, which simplifies the inference process and truly reflects each fuzzy subset and fuzzy control rule in real-time fuzzy inference process [32]. The FFSI is a simple, fast, and suitable method for fuzzy controllers with different structures. Zhao et al. employed the Mamdani-type fuzzy rules and the FFSI to develop a duty ratio fuzzy control method [33]. The FFSI method has been utilized by Zhang et al. to reset the static pressure of the variable air volume system [34]. The specific implementation process of FFSI is given as follows: Step 1: Define the fuzzy theory domain of the system input and output and their corresponding fuzzy inference rules. Step 2: Map the calculated deviation e and its variations ec to the corresponding fuzzy theory domain. The fuzzy values of e and ec are denoted by e* and ec*, respectively. Step 3: Determine the functional fuzzy subsets of e* and ec*, denoted by Ai and Bi, respectively. Step 4: Calculate the output truth value μk for each inference rule as: (13) μ k = A i ( e ∗ ) ∗ B i ( e c ∗ ) ( k = 1,2 , ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ , n ) Step 5: Convert each truth value μk into the fuzzy value of the output u* according to the gravity method and map it to the actual output quantity. (14) u ∗ = ∑ k = 1 n ( μ i × u i ) ∑ k = 1 n μ i The fuzzy control algorithm of indoor temperature set point optimization based on the Mamdani fuzzy model and FFSI method is presented in Fig. 4 . 2.4 Test-bed and participants A series of experiments were performed using the thermal sensation prediction control, thermal sensation feedback-based control, and temperature set point-based control to evaluate the performance of the fuzzy control algorithm of the thermal sensation prediction-based control method. The experiments had been accomplished at Dalian University of Technology, China. As shown in Fig. 5 , the test-bed consists of three office rooms. All three office rooms were selected to perform the experiments. The essential information about each office room is presented in Table 2 . The NO.1, NO.2, and NO.3 office rooms can accommodate up to 6, 4, and 6 occupants undertaking office work simultaneously. The appropriate sensors were installed at each office to measure the environmental data, including indoor air temperature, indoor air humidity, and CO2 concentration. The measurement ranges and specifications of the sensors are shown in Table 3 . A wristband device that can monitor the wrist skin temperature and heart rate was employed to obtain psychological data. The VAV box damper and the supply fan speed were adjusted to regulate the indoor temperature within the range of 0.1 °C. To reduce the effect of other parameters, including the relative humidity and CO2 concentration on the thermal comfort, the former was kept between 40% and 60%, while the latter was kept under 800 ppm, as suggested by ASHRAE Standards 62.1 [35]. Since the experiments were performed during the COVID-19 epidemic, the air conditioning system was operated at maximum fresh air volume suggested by China's national standard called Hygienic Specifications for Operation and Management of Air-conditioning Ventilation Systems in Office Buildings and Public Places during COVID-19 Epidemic (WS 696-2020). A total of 31 healthy subjects, including 12 females and 19 males, participated in the experiments with stable physiological conditions, without any disease such as a cold or a fever. Before the experiments, they had good sleep and diet, without any alcohol consumption and strenuous activity. The subjects were divided into two groups during the experiments, where the first group included 15 subjects, and the second one contained 16 subjects. The basic information about the participants is shown in Table 4 . 2.5 Experimental procedure The experiments were carried out to evaluate and compare the performance of the thermal sensation prediction-based control, thermal sensation feedback-based control, and temperature set point-based control. The experiments were performed in 9 days in August 2020, while a similar number of days are adopted for three different control methods. Similar weather conditions were chosen during the experiments (most sunny days). For the first group of experiments performed in 6 days, 15 subjects were arranged to three office rooms, where 6, 4, and 5 subjects stayed in the NO.1, NO.2, and No.3 office rooms, respectively. For the second group of experiments performed in 3 days, 16 subjects were arranged to three office rooms, where 6, 4, and 6 subjects stayed in the NO.1, NO.2, and NO.3 office rooms, respectively. During the experiments, the subjects were requested to wear a short-sleeve T-shirt with no jacket and trousers, so that the clothing levels were approximately 0.57. The experiments with human subjects were performed according to the world medical association's code of ethics, and informed consent was obtained for experimentation with subjects. The temperature set point-based control, thermal sensation feedback-based control, and thermal sensation prediction-based control were utilized to perform three control experiments. 2.5.1 Temperature set point-based control When the temperature set point-based control strategy was implemented, the temperature set point was determined by the subjects. To ensure the control system stability, the temperature set point only changed as two or more subjects input their desired temperatures by using the smartphone APP. The temperature set point variations did not depend on subjects' thermal sensation and psychological data during the temperature set point-based control. To reduce the subjective factors\u2019 impact, the subjects did not know the actual employed control strategy. 2.5.2 Thermal sensation feedback-based control When the thermal sensation feedback-based control strategy was implemented, the temperature set point was changed according to the subjects' thermal sensation vote. The temperature set point only changed when two or more subjects\u2019 thermal sensations submitted through the smartphone APP were not neutral to ensure the control system stability. The weighted average method was utilized to calculate all subjects' group thermal sensation, and the optimal temperature set point was obtained through the following linear adjustment algorithm [29]. (15) t SO = { t SU t S + K TI × ( G T S + 0.5 ) t S t S + K TD × ( G T S − 0.5 ) t SL G T S < − 2.5 G T S ∈ [ − 2.5 , − 0.5 ) G T S ∈ [ − 0.5 , 0.5 ) G T S ∈ [ 0.5 , 2.5 ] G T S > 2.5 where T SO and T ST are the optimal and non-optimal temperature set points, respectively. GTS is the group thermal sensation. T SU and T SL are the upper and lower limits of the temperature set point, respectively. K TI and K TD are the linear adjustment constants corresponding to the increase and decrease in the temperature set point, respectively. During the experiments, T SU and T SL are selected as 28 °C and 22 °C, respectively. 2.5.3 Thermal sensation prediction-based control During the implementation of the thermal sensation prediction-based control strategy, the temperature set point was changed according to the subjects\u2019 predicted thermal sensation. Firstly, the wrist skin temperature and heart rate data were employed to calculate the individual thermal sensation. Then, the group thermal sensation was calculated through the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method. Finally, the fuzzy control algorithm of indoor temperature set point optimization based on the Mamdani fuzzy model and FFSI method was utilized to determine the optimal set point. The schedule of the experiments is shown in Fig. 6 . For each experiment day, the experiments started at 8:30 a.m. and lasted until 5:00 p.m., while 2 h were devoted to the lunch and break. During the experiments, the subjects were asked to stay in the office room and perform regular office activities, such as reading and computer use. The initial temperature set point for all the three control strategies was adjusted to 25 °C, and similar control strategies were chosen for the air-conditioning system. Once the temperature set point was determined, the Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller can provide the VAV Box's supply airflow according to the set point and the actual value. In this study, the indoor temperature control period was chosen as 30 min, which means that the optimal temperature set point was calculated every 30 min. The subjects should submit the satisfaction vote every 30 min by using the smartphone APP to compare the thermal comfort under different control strategies. 3 Experimental results During the experiments, the environmental parameters (including indoor and outdoor air temperatures) and electricity consumption of air-conditioning devices were collected. Moreover, a total of 1846 satisfaction votes were acquired from the smartphone APP. The control performance, thermal comfort, and energy consumption of the temperature set point-based control, thermal sensation feedback-based control, and thermal sensation prediction-based control methods were compared to evaluate the performance of the fuzzy control algorithm of the last method. The control performance and energy consumption were compared at three typical sunny days with similar outdoor air temperatures. The outdoor air temperature variations for three different control strategies are shown in Fig. 7 . The average temperature under the temperature set point-based control, thermal sensation feedback-based control, and thermal sensation prediction-based control were equal to 27.6 °C, 26.8 °C, and 27.3 °C, respectively. 3.1 Control performance Fig. 8 shows the indoor air temperature variations under the temperature set point-based control. The black lines show the upper and lower bounds of the temperature set point, which means that the indoor temperature was adjusted within this range. The temperature set point in the NO.1 office room varied from 25 to 26.5 °C, with an average of 26.2 °C. The temperature set point in the NO.2 office room changed from 25 to 26.5 °C, with an average of 25.8 °C. The temperature set point in the NO.3 office changed from 23 to 26 °C, with an average of 25.2 °C. However, due to the cooling capacity limitation of the air-conditioning system, the actual temperature shown with the red line could not drop to the low-temperature set point, especially in the NO.3 office room. As shown in Fig. 8, the temperature set point was adjusted very few times in all three office rooms, leading to a cold indoor temperature at some time points and unnecessary energy consumption. The details will be discussed in Section 3.3. Fig. 9 shows the indoor air temperature variations under the thermal sensation feedback-based control. The temperature set point ranges in NO.1, NO.2, and NO. 3 office rooms were [25°C\u201327.6 °C], [24.8°C\u201327.6 °C], and [25°C\u201327 °C], with the averages of 26.9 °C,26.5 °C, and 26.4 °C, respectively. The indoor temperature set point under the thermal sensation feedback-based control was higher than that under the temperature set point-based control in all three office rooms, demonstrating the thermal sensation feedback-based control capability for energy saving. Fig. 9 shows that the temperature set point was adjusted many times, indicating that the controller can adjust the indoor temperature set point according to the users' thermal sensation vote. Table 5 shows the number of subjects' feedbacks at each control moment, their thermal sensation vote (TSV), and optimal temperature set point (t so ) under the thermal sensation feedback-based control. Consider that the temperature set point changed when two or more subjects' thermal sensations submitted by the smartphone APP were not neutral. Due to differences in personalized thermal sensation, the temperature set point adjustment according to some people's thermal sensation may lead to the discomfort of others. For example, as two subjects felt slightly warm (+1) at 14:00 in NO.1 office room, the temperature set point was dropped from 27.6 °C to 26.2 °C, which caused four subjects felt slightly cool (−1) at 14:30. However, due to the linear adjustment algorithm limitations, the temperature set point was only increased from 26.2 °C to 26.6 °C, which caused three subjects to feel still slightly cool (−1) at 15:00. The group thermal sensation variations in three office rooms are shown in Fig. 10 . When the group thermal sensation is between −0.5 and 0.5, i.e., most subjects feel comfortable under the current temperature set point, the temperature set point will not change. Fig. 11 shows the indoor air temperature variations under the thermal sensation feedback-based control. The temperature set point ranges in NO.1, NO. 2, and NO. 3 office rooms were [25°C\u201328.7 °C],[25°C\u201328.4 °C], and [25°C\u201327 °C]with the averages of 27.4 °C,27.5 °C, and 26.5 °C. The indoor temperature set point under the thermal sensation prediction-based control method was much higher than the set point under the temperature set point-based control method in all three office rooms, which illustrated that the former consumed less energy than the latter. Compared with thermal sensation feedback-based control, the thermal sensation prediction-based control had a higher temperature set point in NO.1 and NO.2 office rooms and a similar temperature set point in the NO.3 office room. The physiological data can be monitored from the subjects without any interference with the user's normal work under the thermal sensation prediction-based control. Simultaneously, the temperature set point can be adjusted according to the group thermal sensation of all subjects. 3.2 Thermal comfort analysis A total of 1846 satisfaction votes from the thermal environment were obtained from the smartphone APP to analyze the thermal comfort under three control strategies. The T-test was utilized to determine the statistical difference between these three methods. The first null hypothesis is that the satisfaction scores for the temperature set point-based control and thermal sensation prediction-based control are similar. The significant level of the first hypothesis was 0.05, and p 1 values were calculated for all subjects. The second null hypothesis is that the satisfaction scores for the thermal sensation feedback-based control and thermal sensation prediction-based control are the same. The significant level of the second hypothesis was 0.05, and p 2 values were calculated for all subjects. If the p-value is less than 0.05, there is a statistical difference between the control methods. The satisfaction scores and T-test results under three control methods in three office rooms were shown in Tables 6\u20138 . Under the temperature set point-based control, the average satisfaction scores of 27 subjects out of 31 were higher than 4 (neutral), with an average score of 4.61. Under the thermal sensation feedback-based control, the average satisfaction scores of 30 subjects out of 31 were higher than 4 (neutral), with an average of 5.20. Under the thermal sensation prediction-based control, all subjects' average satisfaction scores were higher than 4 (neutral) with the average score of 5.30. These results revealed that the temperature set point-based control satisfies the thermal comfort requirements of users, while satisfactory thermal comfort could be obtained through the thermal sensation feedback-based and prediction-based control methods. As shown in Tables 6\u20138, the p 1 values of 26 subjects out of 31 were lower than 0.05, which illustrated that the thermal sensation prediction-based control could provide superior thermal comfort than the temperature set point-based control for these 26 subjects. Considering the overall subjects' satisfaction scores, the p 1 value was 0.00, demonstrating the thermal comfort performance superiority of the thermal sensation prediction-based control to the temperature set point-based control. The p 2 values of 5 subjects out of 31 were lower than 0.05, which illustrated that most of the subjects did not achieve superior thermal comfort under the thermal sensation prediction-based control compared with the thermal sensation feedback-based control. When the whole subjects\u2019 satisfaction scores were considered, the p 2 value was 0.08, indicating that the thermal comfort performance of the thermal sensation prediction-based control is similar to the thermal sensation feedback-based control. 3.3 Energy consumption comparison The air-conditioning system's energy consumption focuses on the daily electricity consumption cost by the mechanical equipment, consisting of the air handling unit (AHU) containing the supply and returning fans and water system devices, including the chiller, pump, and cooling tower. During the experiments, some electricity energy meters were utilized to measure the power and electricity consumption of each equipment. Figs. 12 and 13 show the electric power of the supply fan and chiller under three control strategies, respectively. As shown in Figs. 12 and 13, the electric power of the supply fan and chiller under thermal sensation prediction-based control were lower than the other two ones. The reason is that the temperature set points given by thermal sensation prediction-based control were higher and more reasonable than that of the other two control methods. The daily energy consumption of the air-conditioning system under three control methods are presented in Table 9 . Similar weather conditions and outdoor air temperature (t out) were acquired under three control methods during the experiment period. The 20.07% and 10.73% reduction in the daily energy consumption was obtained by the thermal sensation prediction-based control rather than temperature set point-based and thermal sensation feedback-based control methods, respectively. 4 Discussion Since it is difficult to determine a comfortable indoor temperature set point with the temperature set point-based control, extremely cold indoor temperature and increased energy consumption may be obtained. The thermal sensation prediction-based control can predict thermal sensation using the wristband device and determine a reasonable temperature set point. The intelligent control system can calculate the optimal temperature set point even if the users do not adjust the air-conditioning system. Moreover, the previous studies [8\u201312] observed that the thermal sensation feedback-based control requires the users to input their real-time thermal sensation, which may interfere with their regular work. Therefore, to solve the thermal sensation feedback-based control problem, the physiological data should be monitored from the wristband device to adjust the temperature set point using the thermal sensation prediction-based control. The thermal sensation feedback-based control method can obtain higher satisfaction score and less energy consumption than the temperature set point-based control. Under the temperature set point-based control, subjects tended to give unreasonable temperature set point, which caused uncomfortable indoor thermal environment and energy waste. The temperature set point under the thermal sensation feedback-based control was more reasonable and higher than that under the temperature set point-based control. Thus, the thermal sensation feedback-based control can not only increase thermal comfort, but also saves energy consumption. These findings of this study concur with Wang\u2019 research [12]. During the experiments, we collected the thermal sensation vote data under the temperature set point-based control and the thermal sensation feedback-based control. During the implementation of the thermal sensation prediction-based control, the individual thermal sensation was calculated using the wristband device's physiological data. The proportion of thermal sensation vote under the temperature set point-based control and thermal sensation feedback-based control is shown in Fig. 14 . The thermal sensation level from −2(cool) to −1(slightly cool) meant the subjects were feeling cold. The proportion of cold sensation under temperature set point-based control and thermal sensation feedback-based control was 29.74%, 23.04%, respectively. The results revealed that more subjects feel cold under the temperature set point-based control. The average thermal sensation under the temperature set point-based control, thermal sensation feedback-based control, and thermal sensation prediction-based control were equal to −0.29, −0.20, and −0.11, respectively. Thus, the satisfaction scores under the temperature set point-based control is lower than that under the thermal sensation feedback-based control and thermal sensation prediction-based control. For a more intuitive comparison of the experimental results, the environmental parameter (including average outdoor temperature and average indoor temperature set point), thermal comfort (including average thermal sensation and average satisfaction scores) and energy consumption under three control strategies are summarized in Table 10 . Under the thermal sensation prediction-based control, the indoor temperature was recognized as the only parameter for indoor environment control without considering the indoor humidity impact. Therefore, the relative humidity was kept between 40% and 60% during the experiments to avoid influencing the thermal comfort. Meanwhile, the humidity sensation vote was also collected during the experiments under the temperature set point-based control. The results revealed that 93% of the humidity sensation was 0 (neutral), while 5% was −1 (slightly moist) or 1 (slightly dry). Thus, the relative humidity influence on the experimental thermal comfort results can be neglected in this study. As shown in Table 5, four subjects felt slightly cool (−1) at 14:30 in the NO.1 office room. Then, the temperature set point was increased from 26.2 °C to 26.6 °C. At 11:30 a.m., one subject felt slightly cool (−1), and one felt cool (−2) in the NO.2 office room. Now, the temperature set point was increased from 27.3 °C to 27.6 °C. As shown in Figs. 10 and 11, the group thermal sensation was −0.8 at 11:00 a.m. in the NO.1 office room. Now, the temperature set point was increased from 27.9 °C to 28.7 °C. At 11:30 a.m., the group thermal sensation was −1.2 in the NO.2 office room. Then, the temperature set point was increased from 26.9 °C to 28.0 °C. The linear adjustment algorithm limitation caused the low temperature set point adjustment under the thermal sensation feedback-based control. The results demonstrated that the proposed fuzzy control algorithm is superior to the previously-proposed linear adjustment algorithm [29]. In this study, a fuzzy control method is proposed for the indoor temperature set point optimization using the wristband device to predict the thermal sensation. A linear regression model-based updating method is introduced to realize the thermal sensation prediction model's real-time updating, improving the thermal sensation prediction model accuracy. Furthermore, the Mamdani fuzzy model and FFSI method are utilized to propose a fuzzy control algorithm for the indoor temperature set point optimization, as a generalized version of the intelligent control method of indoor temperature. According to the experimental results, the proposed control method not only provides superior thermal comfort than the temperature set point-based control method but also saves the daily energy consumption compared with the temperature set point-based and thermal sensation feedback-based control methods. However, there are also a few limitations. Since the human experiments were difficult to conduct and time-consuming, only 31 sample subjects, including undergraduate and graduate students, were selected during the experiments. Although the number of subjects and experimental data was statistically feasible and meaningful, more experimental validation tests could improve the results' accuracy. Moreover, the experiments were only performed in the cooling conditioning of the air-conditioning system. The experiments research of three control strategies in the heating conditioning should be performed in further studies. 5 Conclusions In this study, the wristband device was adopted to develop an indoor temperature fuzzy control method. A linear regression model-based updating method was employed to update the thermal sensation prediction model in real-time, while the Mamdani fuzzy model and FFSI method were utilized to establish a fuzzy control algorithm for indoor temperature set point optimization. Several comparative experiments were performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed thermal sensation prediction-based control compared with the temperature set point-based and thermal sensation feedback-based control methods. The control performance, thermal comfort, and energy consumption were compared under three control methods. The main conclusions are summarized as follows: (1) Under the temperature set point-based control, the unreasonable temperature set point with seldom adjustment, leading to a cold indoor temperature at some times and unnecessary energy consumption. Under the thermal sensation feedback-based control, the controller can adjust the indoor temperature set point according to the users' thermal sensation vote, achieving a reasonable temperature set point affecting the subjects' regular work. Under the thermal sensation prediction-based control, the control system could monitor the subjects' physiological data without affecting their regular work. Accordingly, the temperature set point could be adjusted according to the group thermal sensation of all subjects. (2) The average satisfaction scores of 31 subjects under the temperature set point-based control, thermal sensation feedback-based control, and thermal sensation prediction-based control were 4.61, 5.20, and 5.30, respectively. This means that the temperature set point-based control method can realize subjects' thermal comfort requirements, while the other two methods can provide good thermal comfort. According to the T-test results, the thermal sensation prediction-based control provides a thermal comfort performance superior to the temperature set point-based control and similar to the thermal sensation feedback-based control. (3) The thermal sensation prediction-based control leads to a 20.07% save in daily energy consumption compared with the temperature set point-based control. The reason is that the former can provide higher and more reasonable temperature set points than the latter. Due to the proposed fuzzy control algorithm's capability in temperature set point adjustment, the thermal sensation prediction-based control provides a 10.73% save in daily energy consumption compared with the thermal sensation feedback-based control.
