Smart City Center of Excellence (Finest Twins) & Department of Electrical Power Engineering & Mechatronics Tallinn University of Technology Tallinn Estonia To accelerate progress in building sustainability as well as to aid balance supply and demand in the presence of renewable energy generation, a tailored characterization method for the energy flexibility (EF) of buildings is needed. In this paper, a novel two-stage non-intrusive EF characterization method is proposed. In the first stage, unlike the previous studies in which an individual meter is installed on appliances to extract their consumption pattern, a novel unsupervised event-matching non-intrusive load monitoring method is utilized which is time and cost-effective. Moreover, previous research characterize the EF considering as early and as late as possible appliances\u2019 start-time. However, the usage behavior of consumers affects the start-time of appliances. To tackle this issue, in the second stage of the proposed method, the usage behavior of consumers is taken into account for the EF characterization. The proposed method is verified in an individual building level and aggregated level including 50 residential buildings. The obtained results show that the proposed usage behavior-oriented method, characterizes the available aggregated EF with higher accuracy, without adding complexity to the system. These results can be used by aggregators to harness the available EF of buildings to flatten demand consumption by incentivizing potential consumers.

The presence of shiftable/controllable appliances, storage devices, and electric vehicles (EVs) in the residential sector makes it ideal candidate for managing the load in order to improve this balance (Aduda et al., 2017) and provide operational energy flexibility (EF) to the power system (Park et al., 2017). This EF provides grid services and accelerates the transition to a low carbon power grid. In this regard, a new concept entitled demand response aggregator has emerged in the power grid that harnesses the energy flexibility from residential and industrial consumers into the power system to shave peaks of the demand and flatten the demand consumption (Lezama et al., 2020). Previously proposed EF characterization researches require changing the traditional appliances with smart ones or installing sensors on each appliance. This procedure is time-consuming and expensive (D\u2019hulst et al., 2015), and may cause discomfort for the tenants. Therefore, it is beneficial to use a purely analytical method, such as non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM), to extract the appliances\u2019 consumption patterns. Furthermore, these techniques consider the appliances\u2019 earliest start time and latest stopped time to be the same for all consumers. However, the consumers\u2019 usage behavior directly influences the EF and must be included in its characterization (Reynders, 2015). Furthermore, since the extracted EF of an individual residential consumer is small, the aggregated EF of the residential sector should be considered (Vigna et al., 2018). Based on the aggregated EF potential of the residential sector aggregators acting toward the grid as one entity can offer new services to the electricity market (Jafari et al., 2020) and the system operator (Ahmadiahangar et al., 2020). 1.2 Related work This section reviews the literature covering the flexibility analysis of the residential sector and NILM techniques. 1.2.1 Literature review of flexibility analysis The concept of energy flexibility has received considerable attention worldwide from the scientific community (Sajjad et al., 2016) and there are several definitions of residential energy flexibility. According to international projects, such as Annex 67 (Energy Flexible consumers) from International Energy Agency in consumers and Communities program, \u201cEnergy Flexibility of a consumer is the ability to manage its demand and generation according to local climate conditions, user needs, and grid requirements (Vigna et al., 2018)\u201d. In Impram et al. (2020), energy flexibility is defined as the ability of modifying consumption in response to expected and unexpected variability of the power grid. One of the common definitions is presented in D\u2019hulst et al. (2015) in which energy flexibility boundaries are defined by considering the earliest start time and the latest finish time for flexible appliances including shiftable/controllable appliances, storage devices, and EVs. Therefore, the power consumption of flexible appliances and the usage behavior of consumers (their habit Zhai et al., 2018) are required in defining the energy flexibility of each consumer (Reynders, 2015). Several flexibility quantification methodologies are presented in the literature, with a review in Lopes et al. (2016). In the majority of the published papers, the flexibility is defined for smart appliances (Afzalan and Jazizadeh, 2019). However, the process of replacing appliances with smart ones is time-consuming and expensive. Therefore, these approaches are not scalable. Authors in D\u2019hulst et al. (2015) considered the same earliest start time and stop time for all consumers. However, based on the usage behavior of consumers, these times are not same for all consumers. In Zhao et al. (2019), the authors proposed a novel non-intrusive method to extract the charging pattern of EVs. They quantified the flexibility provided by these EVs, however, they have not considered the flexibility provided by appliances. Authors in Fratean and Dobra (2021) and Zhai et al. (2018) define appliance flexibility based on maintaining the indoor temperature to ensure the residents\u2019 comfort and evaluates its effect in demand-side management strategies. To consider different factors in these studies, additional sensors such as smart thermometers are required, which makes these methods impractical and expensive (Zhai et al., 2018). In Vivian et al. (2020), the energy flexibility is defined for the thermal loads considering the available heat storage capacity and the efficiency of active demand response events. The comprehensive review of analytical algorithms to evaluate the EF of building clusters is presented in Vigna et al. (2018). It should be noted that characterizing the EF of each consumer using only the data recorded by smart meters, plays a crucial role in saving time and cost and, at the same time, protecting consumers\u2019 privacy. 1.2.2 Literature review of non-intrusive load monitoring approaches The most accurate way to extract the consumption pattern of appliances is intrusive load monitoring (ILM), in which a meter is installed on each appliance to measure, record, and report its consumption (Liu et al., 2020). However, installing a meter on each appliance is expensive and time-consuming and invades the privacy of the consumers (Liu et al., 2019). To address these challenges, non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) was first defined by Hart (1992). NILM is the process of extracting the power consumption of appliances given the total consumption power (Azizi et al., 2020). NILM increases the utilities\u2019 knowledge about the consumption pattern of appliances without invading the privacy of consumers. This information can be used to increase the efficiency of demand response programs and aggregators\u2019 decision making (Gopinath et al., 2020). A large number of event-based and state-based NILM techniques have been proposed. Event-based methods are defined based on the edges or events of the total signal caused by mode transitions of appliances (Pereira and Nunes, 2020). State-based approaches, such as the hidden Markov model, define each appliance as a finite state machine and extracts the consumption of each appliance based on the pre-defined model (Cominola et al., 2017). Due to the low complexity, event-based NILM techniques have gained a lot of attention in recent years (Liu et al., 2019). Event-based NILM approaches can broadly be divided into two main groups: i) supervised and ii) unsupervised methods. In supervised methods, a training dataset about appliances and their usage pattern is required. Despite their accurate results (Azizi et al., 2021), these approaches are required prior knowledge about the characteristics of an appliance (training dataset) and are time and cost consuming (Buddhahai et al., 2018). In unsupervised methods, events are detected and different clustering algorithms such as subtractive clustering (Henao et al., 2015) or k-means (Kong et al., 2016) are applied to them. These algorithms detect different groups of appliances but they cannot assign a label to each cluster of appliances. Besides, these algorithms are inefficient in dealing with multi-state appliances (Kong et al., 2016) and they can not give detailed and accurate feedback to consumers or utility. According to Li and Dick (2018), ground-truth training dataset in NILM is scarce, but some pre-information about the appliances can be collected. This information can be used in unsupervised approaches to increase the accuracy of disaggregation. In this paper, a novel training-less method is proposed that uses only smart meter data of each residential consumer and the nominal active and reactive power of appliances as pre-information. 1.3 Contributions This paper aims to fill the existing gap in the literature related to EF characterization and improve the accuracy of the characterization of the residential sector by proposing a novel unsupervised and non-intrusive method. In this regard, in the first stage of the proposed method, a NILM method is used to extract the consumption pattern of shiftable appliances. Then, in the second stage, to characterize the EF more precisely, the consumer\u2019s usage habit is also considered. The schematic of the proposed methodology is illustrated in Fig. 1 , and contributions are as follows: \u2022 In the first stage of the proposed method, a novel unsupervised NILM method is utilized to disaggregate the consumption signal of shiftable appliances from the total consumption signal. This method only require the nominal active and reactive power of appliances as the prior information. Therefore, it does not require a large volume of a training dataset and is applicable in the disaggregating the low-frequency sampled dataset. Besides, by eliminating the requirement for installing advance meters, it imposes additional costs for consumers. \u2022 The previous research for EF characterization considers the same earliest and latest start-time for all appliances (D\u2019hulst et al., 2015). However, the usage behavior of consumers affects the start-time of appliances. Therefore, in the second stage of the proposed method, the earliest and latest start-time of appliances is determined based on consumers\u2019 usage behavior and utilized in EF characterization. \u2022 Finally, two case studies are defined to verify the proposed EF characterization method in an individual building level and aggregated level including 50 residential buildings. The results indicate that the similarity of the extracted EF pattern in an individual building level is more than 90% and in the aggregated level the EF characterization is improved more than 40% based on the proposed method. 1.4 Organization The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the fundamental concepts of this paper; Section 3 describes in detail the proposed unsupervised NILM technique and the behavior-based flexibility extraction. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is evaluated using the Almanac of Minutely Power Dataset (AMPds) as a real residential dataset and the artificial residential data of fifty houses generated by the Richardson residential data generator in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper. 2 Overview of fundamental concepts In this section, the fundamental concepts of this paper will be discussed. 2.1 Energy flexibility characterization Generally, the energy flexibility potential of each residential consumer illustrates how much power/energy is available at a certain time during the day and for how long (D\u2019hulst et al., 2015). This characterization depends on the consumption pattern of the shiftable appliances. From the EF characterization methods in the literature, this paper will address it considering the earliest and latest start-time of appliances within functional and comfort limits (D\u2019hulst et al., 2015). Assuming that there are N appliances in a house, their total daily energy consumption, E t i p ( t ) , can be computed as (1) E t i p ( t ) = ∑ i = 1 N ∫ t 0 t P i ( n ) d n , (2) P i ≜ [ P i ( 1 ) , ⋯ , P i ( T ) ] , i ∈ [ 1 , ⋯ , N ] , This daily consumption assumes a standard usage of each appliance. The flexibility potential of a group of appliances is defined based on two extreme boundaries: P max and P min as, (3) P max i ≜ [ P i ( 1 ) , ⋯ , P i ( T ) ] , P i ( t α ) ≥ 0 ; P i ( t β ) = 0 ; ∀ t α < t β (4) P min i ≜ [ P i ( 1 ) , ⋯ , P i ( T ) ] , P i ( t α ) = 0 ; P i ( t β ) ≥ 0 ; ∀ t α < t β The flexibility of the shiftable group of appliances is then depicted by two limit curves, i.e. E max and E min as, (5) E max ( t ) = ∑ i = 1 N ∫ t 0 t P max i ( n ) d n , (6) E min ( t ) = ∑ i = 1 N ∫ t 0 t P min i ( n ) d n , In other words, E max and E min define the energy flexibility boundaries of the considered group of flexible shiftable appliances. It should be noted that the energy flexibility of a consumer can be computed as its possibility to move towards E max or E min , according to the same request (increase or decrease consumption), as shown in Fig. 2 . 2.2 NILM problem definition NILM is the process of extracting the power consumption of each appliance from the total consumption signal (Xia et al., 2021). Let { 1 , ⋯ , N } be the set of appliances, P ( t ) be the total consumption signal and P i ( t ) the power consumption of appliance i . Then, P ( t ) can be formulated as in Azizi et al. (2020), (7) P ( t ) = ∑ i = 1 N P i ( t ) + e ( t ) , Considering M i operation modes representing all ON modes and OFF mode for appliance i with constant consumption power at each mode denoted as X i j , the power consumption of appliance i can be defined as (8) P i ( t ) = A i ( t ) X i , X i = [ x i , 1 , x i , 2 , ⋯ , x i , M i ] , i = 1 , 2 , ⋯ , N A i ( t ) = [ a i 1 ( t ) , a i 2 ( t ) , ⋯ , a i M i ( t ) ] T , i = 1 , 2 , ⋯ , N NILM can be defined as an optimization problem formulated in the following given time period T : (9) min a i j ∑ t = 1 T ( P ( t ) − ∑ i = 1 N ( A i ( t ) X i ) ) , s . t . ∑ j = 1 M i a i j ( t ) = 1 where ∑ j = 1 M i a i j ( t ) = 1 guarantees that each appliance i can operate in just one mode at each time sample of t . 2.3 Event detection The fundamental step of the event-based NILM problem is to accurately detect the events. Due to the presence of noise and fluctuations in the power signal, it is essential to ensure proper event detection. In the majority of studies, an event is defined based on the difference of two consecutive samples considering a pre-defined threshold. However, determining a proper threshold not to miss any real event or not to consider the overshoots or spikes as events is the main challenge in this technique. In this research, the event detection method of (Azizi et al., 2021) will be utilized which detects events based on the statistical algorithm. This method consists of three main steps: Step 1: Outlier detection The procedure begins by calculating the min/max ratio between any two consecutive samples of signal P ( t ) , subtracting them from 1, and storing them on a vector M as (10). Then, the standard deviation of M is computed. Finally, for any t , if M ( t ) is greater than the calculated standard deviation, it is considered an outlier, and t is saved as the outlier occurrence instance in vector M o of outlier instances. (10) M ( t ) = { 1 − ( min ( P ( t − 1 ) , P ( t ) ) max ( P ( t − 1 ) , P ( t ) ) ) } , 2 ≤ t ≤ T . Step 2: Filtered Signal Construction After outlier detection, the aim is to substitute them with proper values. In this regard, the mean of instances that are not detected as outliers (its nearby inlier data) is utilized. Each outlier is substituted with the mean of following consecutive inlier instances. Figure 3 displays this substitution method.Step 3: Event Detection After filtering the signal (detecting outliers and substituting them with proper values) the procedure of Step1 is applied to the filtered signal. In this step, all detected outliers are considered as events. 3 Proposed method To characterize the EF of each residential building the consumption patterns of its shiftable appliances are required. In this section, first, a novel unsupervised NILM method is proposed which determines the label of events based on the nominal active and reactive power of appliances. Then, based on the extracted consumption pattern of flexible appliances, novel behavior-based energy flexibility will be defined. The framework of the proposed methodology is shown in Algorithm 1 . 3.1 Proposed unsupervised NILM method A reliable NILM method must remain accurate, even for large numbers of appliances and the least prior information available. In this regard, since unsupervised NILM methods require no training dataset, they have gained a great deal of attention in recent years. However, the main challenge of these methods is the presence of appliances with close consumption values. To address these issues, the modified version of event-matching method in Azizi et al. (2021) is utilized. Event-matching method in Azizi et al. (2021) classifies events based on the extracted information from the training dataset. However, the proposed event-matching method in this paper does not require a training dataset and classifies events based on the nominal active and reactive power of appliances. It should be noted that, in this paper it will be assumed that: 1. At a given sample only one appliance changes its operation mode. 2. After collecting information about appliances, the consumer does not make any changes (such as buying a new appliance, replacing them, etc) in the set of appliances. In other words, the characteristics of appliances are constant. 3. The consumer is aware of any changes that may happen in the appliances\u2019 set. As an example, if a new appliance is added to the set of appliances, its nominal active and reactive power should be obtained and the proposed NILM method should be applied to the appliances\u2019 set considering previous appliances and the new one. The proposed method has four main phases, as mentioned below. 3.1.1 Defining specific features based on the nominal active power of appliances Appliances are distinguishable based on their specific features such as their consumption pattern, consumption values, etc. In supervised methods, these features are extracted based on the training dataset. However, in the unsupervised methods, additional information should be utilized to distinguish appliances such as the nominal active/reactive power of appliances. The nominal active power of appliances requested by residents or obtained from the datasheet of each appliance is considered as a specific feature of appliances. Then, possible transitions between different modes of multi-mode appliances are also extracted and considered as an additional feature of those appliances. As an example, suppose that i is a multi-mode appliance with two non-OFF modes with the nominal active power of 50 W and 360 W. Due to the fact that there may be a transition between non-OFF modes of i , an event with the value of 310 W belongs to this appliance. Therefore, events with the power value of 50W or 350W or 310W get the label of i in this method. 3.1.2 Event-matching based label assignment The assignment rule for each event of the total signal is defined as (11) i f ∥ e | − T i j | < max { T r , 0.2 × | e | } t h e n L a b e l e = i , 3.1.3 Label refinement based on the reactive power of appliances Since appliances may have overlapped nominal active power, some events may get multiple labels. To refine the assigned appliances to each event and choose the most probable one, a novel technique is proposed in which the nominal reactive power of the appliances is also compared. Therefore, for a multiple-labeled event, the appliance with the closest reactive power is chosen. 3.1.4 Cycle-based signal reconstruction Each consumption signal consists of OFF-samples, in which all appliances are OFF, and ON-cycles, in which at least one appliance is ON. Figure 4 shows OFF-samples and ON-cycles of the total consumption power. To reconstruct the consumption signal of each appliance, the detected events of that appliance should be considered at each ON-cycle. Then, by interpolating between each positive and its corresponding negative event in that cycle, the consumption profile is reconstructed. The flowchart of the proposed method is illustrated in Fig. 5 3.2 Proposed EF characterization considering the residents\u2019 consumption behavior/usage habit To offer flexibility services, aggregators need to accurately estimate the available flexibility of each residential consumer taking into account its residents\u2019 consumption behavior. As mentioned in Section 2.1, the basic definition of energy flexibility is based on considering the earliest start time and the latest finished time for shiftable appliances. However, the earliest and the latest time for different appliances are not the same for different residential consumers because of various consumption behaviors. Therefore, the proposed methodology will use two new parameters to measure the flexibility, considering the consumption behavior, which is the behavior-based extension of (3) and (4). (12) P max , b i ≜ [ ⋯ , P i ( T e ) , ⋯ , P i ( T ) , ⋯ ] , (13) P min , b i ≜ [ ⋯ , P i ( T − T f ) , ⋯ , P i ( T f ) , ⋯ ] , In other words, by analyzing the consumption of each appliance in the historical data, the earliest start time and latest finish time of them are extracted and considered as T e and T f . Then, the min and max cumulative consumed energy of the consumer considering the residents\u2019 consumption behavior can be obtained based on (14) E max , b ( t ) = ∑ i = 1 N ∫ t 0 t P max , b i ( n ) d n , (15) E min , b ( t ) = ∑ i = 1 N ∫ t 0 t P min , b i ( n ) d n , 3.3 Proposed Aggregated EF characterization of residential buildings Since the proposed method of behavior-based EF characterization is scalable, it can be used in both on individual and aggregated levels. In other words, the aggregated EF of the residential sector in a specific block of buildings or energy community can be computed, using the previous cumulative consumed energy boundaries as (16) and (17) without decreasing accuracy. (16) E max , a g , b ( t ) = ∑ j = 1 N b E max , b , j ( t ) , (17) E min , a g , b ( t ) = ∑ j = 1 N b E min , b , j ( t ) , 4 Case studies and numerical results In this research to evaluate the performance of the proposed clustering-based NILM algorithm and EF characterization method, two different use cases with two distinct datasets are addressed. The first case study uses real measured data of a residential consumer in the Greater Vancouver metropolitan area in British Columbia with a one-minute sampling rate during a year (Makonin et al., 2013). The second case considers the consumption data obtained with the Richardson model, which simulates data with a one-minute sampling rate (Richardson et al., 2010). 4.1 Evaluation metrics Different evaluation metrics are utilized in this paper which are listed below. 4.1.1 Label assignement evaluation The F-measure metric is widely used in the literature to evaluate the efficiency of NILM methods. In this paper, this metric is used to evaluate the appliance assignment to each event of the aggregated signal which is calculated according to the following equations. (18) F m e a s u r e = 2 × T R P × R C T R P + R C , (19) T P R = T P T P + F N , R C = F P F P + T N . 4.1.2 Reconstruction Error To evaluate the accuracy of the proposed NILM method, the normalized absolute error between the actual and the estimated power consumption of each appliance is computed based on (20) (Azizi et al., 2020). (20) A C i = 1 − ∑ t = 1 T | P i ( t ) − P ˜ i ( t ) | 2 ∑ t = 1 T P i ( t ) , 4.1.3 Energy flexibility characterization improvement based on consumer\u2019s comfort To increase the comfort of the consumer, the boundaries of the characterized EF should be close to the energy pattern of the consumer. To realize how much the EF characterization has improved based on the comfort of the consumer, the following coefficient is defined. (21) E F i m p = 1 − d i s t ( E , ( E max , b , E min , b ) ) d i s t ( E , ( E max , E min ) ) where, d i s t ( E , ( E max , E min ) ) = ∑ t = 1 T | E ( t ) − E max ( t ) | + ∑ t = 1 T | E ( t ) − E min ( t ) | , d i s t ( E , ( E max , b , E min , b ) ) = ∑ t = 1 T | E ( t ) − E max , b ( t ) | + ∑ t = 1 T | E ( t ) − E min , b ( t ) | , 4.2 Case study 1: In the first case study, to evaluate the performance of the proposed clustering algorithm, the dataset AMPds was considered which consists of 1,051,200 minutely readings from 21 power meters (Makonin et al., 2013). Six appliances were used to discuss the proposed algorithm in detail. These appliances include a heat pump (HPE), a clothes dryer (CDE), a dishwasher (DWE), as flexible appliances, and a refrigerator (FGE), basement electricity (BME) and oven (WOE). The nominal active and reactive power of these appliances are shown in Table 1 . Fig. 6 illustrates the consumption pattern of these appliances in a day of this dataset and the total consumption which is the sum of the individual appliances\u2019 consumption. 4.2.1 Signal filtering and event detection After applying the event-detection method, outliers of the signal are detected as shown in Fig. 7 and the filtered signal is reconstructed as shown in Fig. 8 . 4.2.2 Applying the proposed NILM algorithm and constructing the signal of each appliance In the first step of the unsupervised NILM method, the probable transitions based on the nominal active power of the multi-mode appliances are extracted which is displayed in Table 2 . As discussed in Section 3.1, the active power of appliances and the extracted power values of probable transitions of appliances are considered as the specific features of appliances. Then, the proposed active-power matching NILM technique is applied to the detected events, considering T r = 100 W . Based on the Table 1 and 2, there are 4 different groups of appliances that have close active consumption values {(FGE,DWE),(FGE,CDE),(HPE,CDE),(FGE,BME)}. However, as it is shown in Fig. 9 , they have various reactive power values. As an example, as it is shown in Fig. 10 FGE and DWE have close active power however their reactive power values are not same. Therefore, in this stage based on the nominal reactive power of appliances, the most probable label is chosen for each multi-labeled event. Table 3 compares the accuracy of this stage with (Machlev et al., 2018). It should be noted that the average accuracy of the proposed method in which all modes of multi-mode appliances have been considered, is higher than (Machlev et al., 2018). Finally, by interpolating between each positive event with its corresponding negative event, the signals of appliances are reconstructed. The constructed signal of each shiftable appliance is shown in Fig. 11 . The reconstruction accuracy is computed based on (20) for each appliance and compared to Zeinal-Kheiri et al. (2019) which is shown in Table 4. This comparison proofs the effectiveness of the proposed method in disaggregating a high number of multi-mode appliances with overlapping consumption values. 4.2.3 Extracting the energy flexibility potential The energy flexibility potential is computed based on the basic definition as (5) and (6) for real and predicted consumption signals of flexible appliances. Then, after considering the consumption behavior and extracting the earliest and latest time of consumption of appliances, the energy flexibility potential is calculated. All these computed variables are shown in Fig. 12 . The difference between the calculated available EF and the actual one is less than 8%. 4.3 Case study 2 To evaluate the proposed method from the aggregator\u2019s viewpoint, 50 different houses from the Richardson dataset are considered (Richardson et al., 2010). The appliance set of all of these houses contains three shiftable appliances: dishwasher, washing machine, and washer dryer and four unshiftable appliances: freezer, refrigerator, microwave and oven. Demand data was simulated considering 1 to 5 residents for each house. The active and reactive power of these appliances are illustrated in Table 5 . In the first step, proposed NILM method is applied to this set of appliances. Table 6 illustrates the reconstruction accuracy of this method. The energy patterns with and without considering residents\u2019 consumption behavior are illustrated in Fig. 13 . The aggregated energy patterns of five randomly chosen houses with and without considering the residents\u2019 consumption behavior are shown in Fig. 14 . As it is shown in Fig. 14, the available energy flexibility considering the consumer behavior is closer to the actual value of a typical day from the aggregator\u2019s viewpoint. It should be noted that, for 50 houses based on (21), the proposed method improves the EF characterization more than 40%. Table 7 shows the improvement of the available EF characterization based on (21). 5 Conclusion and future work 5.1 Conclusion In this paper, a detailed and comprehensive two-stage energy flexibility (EF) characterization method has been presented for shiftable appliances of residential buildings. In the first stage of the proposed method, a novel unsupervised non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) method is utilized which extracts the consumption pattern of shiftable appliances via analyzing the active and reactive power. Then, in the second stage, the earliest and the latest consumption of flexible appliances are extracted based on the consumer\u2019s behavior and utilized in energy flexibility characterization. The proposed method is verified in a building level and aggregated level including 50 residential buildings. The main findings can be summarised as follows: \u2022 Comparing the results of the proposed NILM method with two recently introduced NILM techniques indicate relatively high accuracy of the proposed algorithm in disaggregating a large number of multi-mode appliances. \u2022 In the individual building level, the similarity of the characterized EF based on the extracted consumption of appliances via NILM method, in comparison with the actual available EF is more than 90%. \u2022 In the aggregated residential sector level, the available aggregated EF characterization is improved more than 40%. The proposed NILM method omits the requirement for installing a sensor on each appliance which is time and cost-effective and respects the privacy of the consumers. Moreover, since the proposed method is scalable, it can be utilized in both aggregated and individual levels in the residential sector. Therefore, maintaining the applicability from the aggregator\u2019s standpoint while protecting consumers\u2019 privacy makes the proposed method practical. Applying the proposed model, the aggregator is able to decide on the viability of incentivizing residential consumers to change their demand patterns to match a flexibility request from the distribution system operator. 5.2 Future work The proposed NILM method requires accurate data/information on nameplate real and reactive power consumption of all the residential appliances at all operating modes. When this method is applied by an aggregator in the real world, it would be difficult to obtain these data for all the residences and all the appliances within each residence. In future work, we will move a step further to utilize transfer learning that does not require collecting information about appliances of each individual consumer.

        "dc:description": "To accelerate progress in building sustainability as well as to aid balance supply and demand in the presence of renewable energy generation, a tailored characterization method for the energy flexibility (EF) of buildings is needed. In this paper, a novel two-stage non-intrusive EF characterization method is proposed. In the first stage, unlike the previous studies in which an individual meter is installed on appliances to extract their consumption pattern, a novel unsupervised event-matching non-intrusive load monitoring method is utilized which is time and cost-effective. Moreover, previous research characterize the EF considering as early and as late as possible appliances\u2019 start-time. However, the usage behavior of consumers affects the start-time of appliances. To tackle this issue, in the second stage of the proposed method, the usage behavior of consumers is taken into account for the EF characterization. The proposed method is verified in an individual building level and aggregated level including 50 residential buildings. The obtained results show that the proposed usage behavior-oriented method, characterizes the available aggregated EF with higher accuracy, without adding complexity to the system. These results can be used by aggregators to harness the available EF of buildings to flatten demand consumption by incentivizing potential consumers.",
