In South Korea, school buildings require significant energy inputs for heating and air-conditioning, and the majority of the occupants are adolescent students, whose health and cognitive performance are vulnerable to poor indoor air quality (IAQ) and thermal discomfort. Using field measurements, some previous studies have reported that some Korean schools have poor IAQ and thermal conditions. Thus, it is necessary to develop effective heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) control strategies to improve the indoor environment and reduce energy consumption. Therefore, this study proposes an intelligent HVAC integrated control strategy that can improve indoor environmental quality (IEQ) and reduce energy consumption in school buildings. The proposed strategy utilizes an integrated neural network prediction model for IEQ and a heuristic method that can optimize control objectives (i.e., the predicted mean vote [PMV], carbon dioxide [CO2], particulate matter with diameters of 10 and 2.5 μm [PM10 and PM2.5, respectively], and HVAC energy consumption). To evaluate the control performance of the proposed strategy, the present study employs two base algorithms (i.e., a rule-based and a non-adaptive control approach) under non-disturbance and forcing disturbance scenarios. The control failure period for PMV is found to be 1.6420% and 9.4773% of the total occupancy period under the non-disturbance and forcing disturbance scenarios, respectively, while CO2 control failure does not occur under either scenario. The control failure periods for PM10 and PM2.5 were 5.1676%, and 7.1844%, respectively, under forcing disturbance. Under the non-disturbance scenario, the proposed strategy consumed 2,467.07 kWh and 870,26 kWh for heating and cooling, respectively, representing 91.1% and 84.08% of that for the rule-based algorithm. The proposed strategy can thus effectively improve the IEQ of a building and has the potential for use in the development of integrated environmental management solutions for buildings.

Adolescents are vulnerable to air pollutants and thermal stress and can suffer more health hazards than adults if exposed to indoor environments for a long time, where air pollution is high and thermal condition is poor [2\u20134]. Therefore, improving the environment of school buildings is directly related to ensuring student health and protecting human educational resources. In accordance with this, governments of many countries have been proposing legal guidelines to manage effective IAQ improvement and thermal environment in school facilities [5]. Representatively, the ministry of education Korea has proposed hygiene and environmental criteria and management guideline with that school buildings should comply [6]. However, this guideline is limited to suggesting the proper temperature levels for heating and cooling, the standard for the concentration of air pollutants, and natural ventilation. In addition, studies conducted on the IEQ of school buildings indicated that the IAQ of some school facilities and the thermal performance of buildings were inadequate, suggesting that alternative measures are essential [7\u20139]. Simultaneously, the problem has arisen, that the energy consumption of school facilities in Korea is increasing [10]. school buildings' energy consumption accounts for about 16.1% of all buildings annually. In response to these issues, although the Seoul Metropolitan Government implemented the school energy retrofit project as a pilot of the zero-energy building plan, the energy consumption of school buildings has consistently been on increasing trend [11]. Therefore, it is essential to devise an innovative HVAC control or building operation strategy that can comprehensively improve the indoor environment with energy-saving of the school building. Although studies have consistently been conducted to promote improving IEQ and energy-saving in school buildings, it is necessary for establishing an optimal HVAC operation strategy to consider the physical characteristics of buildings [12]. Indoor environmental factors do not mutually influence each other in a static condition like a non-operation or non-occupied period. However, they simultaneously vary according to their unique dynamic behavior with building operation conditions (e.g., lighting, HVAC, natural ventilation) [13,14]. Additionally, various and highly uncertain factors are inherent in buildings, which are regarded as disturbances to building control and operation processes caused by changes in occupants' behavior [15]. Especially various activities happen in a classroom, such as play, cleaning, and rest, as well as lectures. Hence, to optimally improve IEQ and energy-saving in school buildings, an HVAC control strategy is essential to comprehensively reflect various dynamic behaviors of the building and actively respond to disturbances and conflicts of control targets in HVAC control processes. Recently, many studies have utilized artificial intelligence (AI) for optimal building operation and state estimation [16]. AI simulates human cognitive functions [17] and has been widely used in building applications in the form of machine learning (ML), artificial neural networks (ANNs), deep learning (DL), and fuzzy control (FC) [18]. Supervised learning models, which include ANNs, have proven to be highly effective in the predictive control of PMV [19] and in estimating the spatiotemporal distribution of indoor air contaminants [20]. For example, a long short-term memory neural network can predict indoor airborne concentrations [21], and the Gaussian process regressor (GPR) and support vector machine (SVM) can effectively estimate CO2 concentrations [22]. In addition, a simplified time-series model is capable of the computationally efficient and accurate prediction of indoor formaldehyde concentrations [23]. Also, DL models were shown to predict energy demands and consumption accurately [24,25]. They also have high feasibility in patterning short-term energy consumptions in an operation and plan stage of the building [26]. Besides, it was confirmed that the naive bayes model and recurrent neural network could be employed in mining building performance data and reducing water usage [27,28]. Via the above literature review, it is expected that the building operation and HVAC control strategy adopting the AI approach can be effective in the IEQ and HVAC energy management of school buildings by actively responding to the uncertainty of indoor environmental factors, disturbance factors, and nonlinearity. In addition, the data-driven AI model is easy to apply edge computing and gradual accuracy improvement through real-time statistical learning [29,30]. This means that an AI-based control strategy can secure control performance suitable for the characteristics of each room without a separate control tower or centralized monitoring system. 1.2 Aims and scopes An integrated neural network (INN) prediction model was suggested as a primary study for this study. It was capable of multiple predictions of IEQ factors of school buildings and its potential applicability in building control with high accuracy. It was quantitively shown that this method could reduce the risk of spurious regression of the multi-inputs-multi-outputs (MIMO) neural network model by cutting the unnecessary variable connection in fitting and simultaneously reflect the different effects of a specific input on each output variable. Thus, the INN-based model can secure high prediction accuracy in the training process [31]. This study aims to propose an intelligent HVAC control strategy for the indoor environment and HVAC energy-saving using an INN model. This control strategy seeks to save HVAC energy and protect adolescents from poor IAQ (CO2, PM10, and PM2.5) and thermal discomfort using an integrated control strategy with intelligent technology. To secure the applicability of this control strategy to be utilized as one of the basic research approaches for the integrated control strategy for the IEQ and HVAC energy in schools, the following research processes were conducted: 1) INN-based HVAC predictive control strategy conceptualization; 2) Devising an adaptive error compensation process for enhancing the prediction model; 3) Establishment of the reconciliation process for decision-making conflict factors concerned in multi-objective control. For the control of thermal comfort, the PMV index was adopted as a target objective, which quantifies the thermal sensations of the human body and is generally used to evaluate the thermal environment quality [32]. Min et al. (2014) showed that a comfortable thermal environment could enhance the concentration of adolescents on educational activities, where the PMV range is from −0.5 to 0.5 [33]. However, it has been pointed out that PMV has limitations in terms of representing the actual thermal comfort of the human body, and the need to develop a more accurate thermal comfort index has been discussed [34]. In addition, many thermal comfort indices developed using empirical analysis have exhibited higher reliability and accuracy than PMV in quantifying thermal comfort, including the adaptive thermal comfort model [35]. However, for HVAC control, it is difficult to utilize empirically based indicators based on the thermal history experienced by the human body. Added to this, because PMV is based on the thermal equilibrium between the human body and the indoor space, it is still widely used as a thermal comfort control factor in fully regulated spaces [36]. The proposed control strategy seeks to predict the concentrations of indoor CO2, PM10, and PM2.5 after one control cycle in the future and to save them energy-efficiently. Indoor CO2 concentration is a widely used indicator for evaluating IAQ and ventilation adequacy in buildings, and high concentrations of CO2 can cause drowsiness, respiratory discomfort, and brain disease [37]. By the World Health Organization, PM10 and PM2.5 are classified as Group 1 carcinogens [38]. Thus, they are being managed under the legalized guideline of school sanitation and environments [6]. Also, it is challenging to devise a comprehensive and simultaneous reduction strategy for them. Because these contaminants have non-monotonicity and non-linear behaviors that vary greatly depending on indoor and outdoor airflow conditions, occupant activities, and ambient pollution [39,40]. Therefore, this study seeks accurate concentration prediction and efficient reduction of the above three pollutants through a control strategy using the INN model. The present study does not investigate the adaptation of occupants to indoor air pollutants and their health risk indices. Calculating health risk indicators based on human exposure and adaptation to contaminants requires biological information (i.e., the respiration rate, digestibility, and absorption rate of pollutants) [41,42]. Collecting these data was beyond the scope of the present study. It is also difficult to process the data to create a variable that can represent the state of the indoor air pollution of a specific space and be used as a control factor. Therefore, the present control strategy assumes that health risks are a concern if each IAQ control target exceeds a particular concentration limit and takes corresponding measures. For the operation systems of proposed strategy, this study adopts an electric heat pump (EHP) air conditioner and a ventilator. EHP air conditioners are generally used in school buildings, and ventilators must be installed in school buildings by the law of MOE [43,44]. Also, it is assumed that an air purifying filter is built into the outdoor air supply node to reduce PM levels via ventilation. The manipulated variables, control targets and modes of the control strategy are shown in Table 1 . 2 The integrated-control strategy of HVAC in a classroom 2.1 The conceptualization of control strategy The proposed control strategy can maintain adequate IEQ in the classroom and save HVAC energy (i.e., heating/cooling and ventilation fan energy) via four processes: (1) The INN model predicts future deterioration of IEQ and determining HVAC operation mode; (2) prioritizing the control targets in the decision-making for the required operation; (3) optimizing manipulated variables and reconciling conflicts of interest in control decision; and (4) an adaptive error compensation. These processes secure the adequate IEQ in an energy-efficient manner responding to exogenous disturbances. The summarized procedures of the proposed control strategy are shown in [Fig. 1]. Stage 1: Determining HVAC operation mode using the INN model. The INN model predicts P M V ^ , C O 2 ^ , P M 10 ^ , and P M 2.5 ^ under the assumption of HVAC turning-off, which can imply the natural deterioration or improvement of IEQ factors. And then, the strategy uses these predicted values to combine the single HVAC operation modes and determine the appropriate mode from the current cycle to the future cycle after one time step, which can prevent the passive deterioration of indoor environmental factors. The followings are single HVAC operation modes available being combined via the proposed strategy: (1) heating and cooling for the PMV; (2) heat recovery or simple mechanical ventilation to reduce indoor CO2 concentration; (3) In case of PM10 and PM2.5, filtration through recirculation of indoor air using filters. However, when deterioration of both PM and CO2 is expected, outdoor ventilation or heat recovery ventilation is performed since CO2 concentration can only be reduced by supplying fresh air. For example, in winter, If the INN model predicts that PMV is out of the comfortable range and high concentrations of PM10 or PM2.5, heating and recirculation are performed simultaneously. The boundary conditions of this control strategy were rigorously established to respond promptly to the inertia of indoor environment changes and ensure stability. If P M V ^ is forecasted to deviate from |0.25| through INN prediction, cooling and heating are turned on. This is because the PMV fluctuates greatly depending on the change of metabolic rate for the same thermal condition. In particular, the metabolic rate pattern follows a highly stochastic characteristic according to the occupant's behavioral pattern. It was investigated that as the metabolic rate changes by 0.1 MET under the same thermal environment conditions, the difference in PMV exceeds the absolute value of 0.2 on average. In addition, for CO2, if the predicted value of C O 2 ^ under non-operating HVAC conditions exceeds 630 ppm, the ventilation system is turned on. It has been found that a CO2 concentration of 700 ppm or more in a confined area can lead to cognitive decline with long periods of exposure. Thus, the proposed control strategy aims to keep the concentration of CO2 below 700 ppm within the school building, where educational activities occur. The CO2 generation rate for adolescents between the ages of 11 and 16 ranges between 0.003 L/s and 0.006 L/s, depending on their gender, age, and body mass. In addition, depending on the maximum occupancy and volume of the controlled space, a variance of 70 ppm to 130 ppm can occur. Therefore, this study set a C O 2 ^ trip-point of 630 ppm for the control strategy. For indoor PM10 and PM2.5, the proposed strategy attempts to manipulate PM reduction when P M 10 ^ or P M 2.5 ^ exceeds 90% of the 'good state' concentration level in the legal guidelines, considering the risk of high concentration due to resuspension, etc. Their boundary condition of control is 27 μg/m3 and 13.5 μg/m3, respectively. It is clearly stated that the control boundary conditions of this study were set to ensure stability. In addition, since the variable used in the control establishment condition is a predictive value that implies a natural deterioration or improvement process assuming that the HVAC is not operating, it is intended to respond to the inertia of exogenous factors preemptively. Stage 2: prioritize the target objectives in the control decision-making. The proposed strategy employs a weighted-summed multi-objective optimization to derive optimal control decisions, which utilizes weight functions capable of precluding weak-informative or arbitrary decisions caused by users. This process reconciles the conflicts in control decision-making by logically prioritizing objectives, using formulated weight functions and the simplified calculation of HVAC energy consumption. In detail, the weight functions have a piece-wised continuous shape of a constant and a linear form. Also, they used the predicted value by INN as inputs for calculating prioritized importance. The calculated weights are inputted into the cost function to derive optimal control decision-making. The following Eqs. (1)−(5) are the weight functions of control targets. The closer the weight value of a specific target is to 1, the higher the target has the priority for improvement. The forecasted quantitative deterioration of each control target is acquired by subtracting the current IEQ value from the predicted values under the assumption of HVAC non-operation. Each deterioration degree is used as the input of the weight function. Adopting this weight calculation for optimization and decision-making can prioritize the control targets demanding rapid improvement. After calculating the weights for the IEQ, the weight for the HVAC energy consumption is calculated by adjusting the IEQ weights. This sequential process enhances the performance of the building as a shelter first, with the conservation of energy a secondary consideration. In Eq (5), k is the number of IEQ variables that are to be improved, taken from Stage 1. To help understanding regarding weights, for example, supposing the weight of the IEQ variable requiring control is 0, the control strategy operates the HVAC system by manipulated variables that satisfy the IEQ variables in the control standard with expected minimal energy consumption. The linear function components ( θ PMV , θ CO 2 , θ PM 10 , θ PM 2.5 ) serve an essential role in calculating the weight. θ PMV , θ CO 2 , θ PM 10 , and θ PM 2.5 is 0.5, 100, 20, and 10, respectively. In the previous section, the sensitivity of the metabolic rate to PMV and the uncertainty of CO2 generation are considered to determine the slopes of a linear function. For the PMV, 0.5, the fluctuation magnitude (about −0.2 to + 0.2) per a change of 0.1 MET, is employed as θ PMV . θ CO 2 is set to 100 based on the average of the uncertain amount of CO2 generated in individual respiration of the human body. However, because of difficulties in capturing the uncertainty of PM10 and PM2.5, the θ is 20 and 10 for PM10 and PM2.5, respectively. Clearly, the value of θ PM 10 , and θ PM 2.5 were chosen to counteract the extremely high generation of pollutants. (1) W PMV = 0 , | PMV ^ - P M V t | < 0 1 θ PMV ( | PMV ^ - P M V t | ) , 0 ≤ PMV ^ - P M V t ≤ θ PMV 1 , θ PMV < PMV ^ - P M V t (2) W co 2 = 0 , CO 2 ^ - CO 2 t < 0 1 θ C O 2 CO 2 ^ - CO 2 t , 0 ≤ CO 2 ^ - CO 2 t ≤ θ CO 2 1 , θ CO 2 < CO 2 ^ - CO 2 t (3) W PM 10 = 0 , PM 10 ^ - PM 10 t < 0 1 θ PM 10 PM 10 ^ - PM 10 t , 0 ≤ PM 10 ^ - PM 10 t ≤ θ PM 10 1 , θ PM 10 < PM 10 ^ - PM 10 t (4) W PM 2.5 = 0 , PM 2.5 ^ - PM 2.5 t < 0 1 θ PM 2.5 PM 2.5 ^ - PM 2.5 t , 0 ≤ PM 2.5 ^ - PM 2.5 t ≤ θ PM 2.5 1 , θ PM 2.5 < PM 2.5 ^ - PM 2.5 t (5) W HVAC = 1 - 1 k ∑ i = 1 k W i In this study, the proposed control strategy uses grid searching to optimize manipulated variables for the IEQ variables requiring control and improvement. This is to simplify the optimization process. The HVAC system for this control strategy is an independent ventilator and EHP without a complicated air-conditioning loop. Thus, a simple system and a relatively small number of manipulated variables were adopted. A variety of optimization techniques have been used for predictive control models, including gradient-based, statistical, and global optimization methods, but these have a number of limitations [45]. Gradient-based methods have the advantage of rapid convergence to global optima, but their search method is susceptible to falling into local minima because they are based on identifying points as global optima where the cost function gradient is calculated to be zero. The use of complicated and multi-variate cost functions can also extend the search process further. Similarly, statistical and global optimization methods cover the global space using a stochastic process, fitness evaluation, and changes in the search direction, but this incurs high computing costs [46]. The strategy proposed in the present study uses a cost function with variables that exhibit different dynamic behaviors (i.e., the fast-moving IAQ and the slow-moving thermal environment). Thus, searching the global space or using the first-order derivative of the cost function is inappropriate in terms of computational efficiency and reliability. In addition, the gradient-based method is not adopted because the cost function space is intricately expressed by a total of five independent variables (i.e., PMV, CO2, PM10, PM2.5, and HVAC energy consumption), leading to concerns that the optimal decision-making result will converge to a local minimum. Therefore, in the present study, a grid search for intuitive variable constraints is determined to be a more efficient strategy in terms of computational cost and reliability. The search time for the grid search used in this study is less than 5 s on average. Optimal manipulated values that satisfy the control target range are adopted as candidates in control decision-making. The control criteria are the following 1) For the PMV, the PMV of a room within − 0.5 - +0.5; 2) for CO2, 700 ppm; 3) For PM10, 30 μg/m3 is the control criterium; 4) For PM2.5,15 μg/m3, respectively. Once a candidate group of manipulated values is produced, each candidate value with expected HVAC energy consumption is calculated using Eqs. (6)\u2013(8) [79]: (6) E Ventilator = m fan ∙ Δ P ε ∙ ρ air (7) Q EHP = m EHPFan ∙ c air ∙ T set - T Room (8) E EHP = m EHPfan ∙ Δ P ε ∙ ρ air After the energy consumption and all weights are calculated, the control costs are summed using Eq. (9). This control strategy solves the multi-objective optimization problem by employing a weighted-sum method. Multi-objective optimization aims to minimize the cost function described in Eq (9) as shown in Eq. (10). In Eq (10), f1 normalizes the samples that satisfy the control target constraints, which are predicted by the neural network in accordance with the manipulated variables sampled in the grid search within the current control cycle, to between 0 and 1. This scaling process is intended to prevent the biasing of the cost function due to differences in units. The scaled variables are denoted as PMV **, CO2 **, PM10 **, and PM2.5 **, respectively. f2 uses Eqs. (6\u20138) to calculate the energy consumption of the EHP terminal and the ventilator fan. Using the value of the manipulated variable identified in the grid search, the calculation of Jcost , and fitness evaluation, the value of the manipulated variable for the current control cycle is determined using Eq. (11). HVAC is operated by MV** in Eq. (11), a vector of values for the control variables that minimize Jcost that are selected according to the neural network predictions. The solution to the multi-objective optimization problem offered by this control strategy differs from Pareto optimization using general multi-objective optimization. The proposed control algorithm determines the control priority using a heuristic approach. It optimizes the control cost function, a comprehensive indicator of the IEQ and system energy behavior. As a result, cost function optimization can reconcile conflicts in decision-making that can occur in the control stage.

The algorithm updates the search range for the setpoint temperature for heating and cooling every control cycle using prediction model [Fig. 2 ]. The minimum cooling setpoint temperature (T*) is set to 2 °C above the room temperature of the current control cycle. If T* cannot maintain a PMV within the comfort range after one cycle, the algorithm will update T* by subtracting 1 °C from the previous T*. However, if any T* cannot maintain future PMV within the comfort range, the algorithm will turn on the cooling at 22 °C. In the case of heating, this algorithm reversely works with cooling. The minimum setpoint is set to 2 °C above the current room temperature. If the prediction model estimates T* cannot maintain the PMV in the comfort range, the algorithm will update T* by adding 1 °C from the previous step of T*. As well as cooling, if any T* cannot fulfill the PMV control demand, heating will be turned on by 28 °C. This searching approach for the manipulated variables prevents unnecessary computing, reflecting indoor thermal inertia and dynamic characteristics in the searching process. Stage 4: An adaptive error compensation. After the control decision, an adaptive error compensation process is executed to improve the estimation accuracy of the INN model in real-time. This error compensation strategy is divided into two detailed methods: seasonal adjustment and real-time re-training. Seasonal adjustment trains the prediction model using input/output datasets corresponding to the further system operating way due to seasonal change. Otherwise, the adaptive-learning algorithm uses a sliding window technique to periodically re-train the model using data acquired in real-time [47]. For the proposed control strategy, adaptive learning is conducted twice a day during non-occupancy periods (during the lunch break and immediately after the end-of-day assembly) to prevent the overfitting of the prediction model and to reduce computing costs. Seasonal adjustments require about 1 min, and the relearning process takes less than 30 s. [Fig. 3] shows the entire process of the proposed control strategy. 2.2 INN-based prediction model An INN model is developed for use in the present study. Various ML models can effectively predict IEQ-related variables. However, after reviewing and analyzing the technical characteristics of widely used models, such as GPR, ensemble learning, and SVM, it is concluded that they are inappropriate in terms of the target performance for the prediction model in the present study. In particular, most of these ML models employ kernel-based learning or an ensemble method of weak estimators. A kernel is a data processing filter that preemptively specifies the statistical relationship between the input and output. For GPR or SVM, which are kernel-based learning models, users must select a kernel based on intuition or model optimization, and their accuracy depends on the shape of the kernel. In addition, even if an optimal kernel function capable of improving accuracy is obtained, there is a concern that the correlation between the input and output variables in the field can differ from the shape of the kernel. Another reason to exclude these models is that modifying their parametric connectivity is highly challenging. [48,49]. Additionally, when using a kernel-based or ensemble learning model, multiple multi-input\u2013single-output (MISO) predictors need to be employed in the control stage as part of an ensemble control approach. This increases the computational time and disrupts information sharing between models, thus hindering the final decision-making for the control cycle. On the other hand, various AI development platforms provide customization that can modify the parametric connection of neural networks based on user intentions. Therefore, in the present study, an ANN is adopted as the prediction model and modified to become an INN model. This control strategy utilizes an INN model that can accurately predict the various IEQ factors in school classrooms [31]. It simultaneously predicts the PMV and indoor CO2, PM10, and PM2.5 concentrations after one cycle at every timestep from the building performance simulation. In the INN model, four MISO ANN models that predict a single control variable are integrated with the form of the selective input variable connections [Fig. 4 ]. This model design can prevent the loss of prediction accuracy for a specific prediction variable from spurious regression caused by interferences of an unnecessary variable in the learning process. The INN modeling was conducted on the platform of MATLAB's deep learning toolbox [50]. As a sequential process of model development, First, the number of hidden layers (the number of neurons was fixed at ten) of the component neural network that predicts each target variable is searched to find the derived number of layers with the smallest estimation error. The search range of hidden layers was from one to three. As a result, it was confirmed that a structure with two hidden layers could potentially have high prediction accuracy for all component neural networks. Therefore, the number of hidden layers in each component neural network constituting the INN was determined to two. Accordingly, model optimization of learning hyper-parameter using a multi-objective genetic algorithm was conducted to improve the fitting ability and prediction accuracy of the prediction model. As a result, the RMSE of the target variable predicted by the neural network compared to the development data set was 0.2243, 0.8816, 0.4645, and 0.6646 in the order of PMV, CO2, PM10, and PM2.5, respectively [31]. 2.3 Computer simulations Multiple building performance simulations programs are used in this study as follows: (1) CONTAM, IAQ, and airflow network simulation [51]; (2) Energyplus, performance simulation of thermal environment and building energy [52]; (3) BCVTB with Functional mock-up unit (FMU), the bridge program of co-simulation between CONTAM, Energyplus, and MATLAB [53,54] [Fig. 5]. The target building is C Middle School, located in Heukseok-dong, Dongjak-gu, Seoul, and its net floor area is 9,999 m2 within the 68.2% confidential range of the average middle school building in Korea (8,642 m2) [43,55]. The target space is one classroom on the second floor, and the geometry of the target building and modeling procedure is shown in [Fig. 6]. At first, according to the floor plan and spatial information of the building, the IAQ simulation model was constructed on CONTAM. Second, by CONTAM3DExporter, the IAQ model was conversed to EnergyPlus input model. Third, the IAQ and dynamic performance models got coupled for the development dataset acquisition. Field-measured data (i.e., blow-door test [56], PM2.5 generation/deposition rate extracted from measured data in actual target building [57]) and legal standards (i.e., U-values of building fabric, ventilator flowrate sizing) were used to comprehensive building performance simulation [58]. For EHP, its capacity was calculated by the auto-sizing function in EnergyPlus engine [59]. The CO2 generation and penetration coefficient of PM was set in simulation conditions by referring to the literature [39,60], dealing with measurement and experiments in fields. Also, this study referred to the typical schedules of building operations, metabolic rate, and clothing schedules. Regarding the information on PM10, this study set its behavior as the same generation/deposition because of the absence of measured data. All the detailed options and settings in simulation programs are shown in Tables 2 and 3 . 2.4 Performance evaluation To evaluate the control performance of the proposed strategy, the following two control strategies were set as alternatives: (1) a fixed air vent set temperature and rule-based ventilation strategy; (2) a Non-adaptive INN-based control strategy without error compensation process. The former is to show the effectiveness of the proposed strategy compared to simple rule-based control, and the latter is to show the effect of the error compensation processor on performance in data-based model-based predictive control. Based on the energy conservation standard, specific operating indoor environments in school buildings is lack [6,58]. Only, it is recommended to maintain the indoor dry bulb temperature at 28\u201330 °C during cooling and at 18\u201320 °C during heating. But this condition is hard to fulfill thermal comfort according to varying in-out condition. Therefore, according to an empirical approach, the heating and cooling set temperature of the low conversion was set to the temperature that caused the smallest control failure of the PMV. It is to use a basic control strategy with improved control performance in terms of fairness since the AI model preemptively learns data and its pattern. As a result of analyzing the INN model development set, it was confirmed that setting the heating temperature to 24 °C and 26 °C caused the least PMV control failure, respectively. Therefore, the basic control strategy's cooling and heating set temperatures were set to 24 °C and 26 °C, respectively [Fig. 7]. All control strategies are executed under the two scenarios to determine the disturbance countermeasure effect. First, the windows are closed all year round, and second, forced disturbances appear according to the regular windows opening. In addition, to analyze the ability to cope with high-concentration indoor pollutants, the PM generation rate was doubled, and the filter built into the outdoor air inlet of the ventilation system was changed from the medium filter to the free filter. Table. 4 shows the satisfaction evaluation items of the control strategy in detail. 3 Result 3.1 Control failures 3.1.1 PMV In the non-disturbance scenario, the proposed control strategy reduced the unmet PMV periods compared with baseline algorithm and non-adaptive control by 38.58% and 35.69%, respectively, from January to March, 68.11% and 19.33% in summer, and 72.35% and 33.03% in November and December [Fig. 8 ]. On the other hand, under the forced disturbance scenario, the reduction in the unmet PMV periods compared to the baseline algorithm and non-adaptive control was 0.18% and 10.15%, respectively, from January to March, 50.00% and 26.72% in summer, and 9.48% and 5.23% in November and December [Fig. 9 ]. The proposed control strategy generated the less PMV unmet hours than the others, and it showed high performance to ensure adequate thermal comfort. However, the neural network-based control occasionally exhibits more extended periods of PMV failure than the base algorithm. For this strategy, the periodic re-training seemed to lead the prediction model to somewhat overfit the data patterns for continuous specific HVAC operation methods during the same season. Although seasonal adjustment was conducted at the change point of HVAC operation, this is considered that periodic re-training causes the volatilization of the memorized model parameter and data pattern related to all seasons\u2019 HVAC operation management way. 3.1.2 CO2 In the case of indoor CO2 concentration, INN-based controls did not generate the control failure, which CO2 concentration exceeds 700 ppm. However, the base algorithm consistently generated CO2 failure periods. Under the non-disturbance scenario, its average and standard deviation was 915 min and 62 min throughout the year [Fig. 10 ]. Also, the similar results happened in the forced disturbance scenario. CO2 control failures only occurred by the base algorithm. And, under the forced disturbance scenario, the base algorithm generated CO2 unmet times from a minimum of 290 min to 465 min [Fig. 11 ]. This means that INN-based algorithm can effectively recognize the CO2 generation patters. 3.1.3 PM10 and PM2.5 Under the window closure year-round scenario, PM10 control failures did not happen with respect to any control logic. However, regarding the window opening scenario [Fig. 12 ], on average, the control failure period per algorithm was about 445.83 min for the base algorithm, 473.75 min for the non-adaptive control algorithm, and 436.66 min for the adaptive control strategy, with standard deviations of 413.47, 433.40, and 391.49, respectively. However, for the total period of the year, the non-adaptive control algorithm generated PM10 control failures for 5,685 min, the base algorithm for 5,350 min, and the adaptive control strategy for 5,240 min. The non-adaptive control strategy did not respond to the forced disturbance conditions. This suggests that the error compensation process is essential for the real-time application of statistical learning models to data. After simulating the control strategies in the non-disturbance scenario, cases in which the PM2.5 concentration exceeded the control standard occurred from January to April [Fig. 13 ]. As a result of summing the control failure period for each control strategy, the adaptive control strategy generated a 6-min control failure period. On the other hand, for scenarios in which window ventilation was forced, periods where PM2.5 exceeded 15 μg/m3 occurred throughout the year for all control strategies [Fig. 14 ]. In addition, the proposed control strategy could not effectively respond to the active inflow of PM2.5 due to forced window ventilation. The control failure period for the proposed strategy was thus reduced by 7.55% and 4.74% compared to the baseline and non-adaptive strategies. However, it was confirmed that the proposed strategy generally generated fewer PM10 unmet times than other algorithms, even under disturbance conditions. 3.2 Statistical analysis of IEQ control results Via statistical analysis, it was shown that the daily average PMV derived by this control strategy under non-disturbance conditions was maintained at a value relatively close to the neutral point (PMV = 0), and the fluctuation range was narrower than that of the non-adaptive control strategy. In addition, under the forced disturbance scenario, all algorithms showed a relatively large range of PMV fluctuation. Still, this control strategy maintains the average daily PMV relatively closer to the neutral point than other algorithms. In addition, other control strategies generated points where the daily average value of PMV was less than −0.5. However, this control strategy successfully maintained the comfort range of daily average PMV during the simulation period. The 99% confidence intervals of the PMV for the two scenarios are shown in [Fig. 15 , Fig 16 ]. Fig. 17 is a box plot of CO2 concentrations for all control strategies. Under window-closed conditions, the INN-based control strategy maintained the CO2 concentration below 700 ppm throughout the year, and its interquartile range was narrower than that of the base strategy. On the other hand, in the disturbance condition, the CO2 generation trend varied due to the window opening. Unlike the closed state, all algorithms' CO2 concentration fluctuation range widened, but this control strategy showed the smallest fluctuation range of less than 700 ppm [Figs. 18 , 19 ]. As a result of PM control under non-disturbing condition, it was confirmed that all algorithms kept the daily average indoor PM concentration low in preparation for the occurrence of high outdoor air concentrations. This is due to the small penetration coefficient. On the other hand, the curve of indoor PM concentration versus outdoor PM concentration under the window open condition showed that this control strategy could keep the indoor PM concentration relatively low compared to the outdoor PM concentration. From the statistical analysis, the main factors that this control strategy can maintain a stable thermal and air environment are as follows. First, preemptive prediction of deterioration of the indoor environment; second, prioritization of control goals; and third, conflict resolution in the decision-making stage using cost functions. Fourth, gradual re-learning to minimize decision-making failures. Unlike other algorithms, this control strategy succeeded in controlling the target variables to have a relatively low variance within the tolerable range. 3.3 Energy consumption The following Fig. 20 shows the annual heating, cooling, and fan energy consumption of all algorithms according to each scenario. In the unopened window scenario, heating energy consumption was 2,707 kWh, 2,467 kWh, and 2,138 kWh in the order of the base algorithm, the adaptive algorithm, and the non-adaptive algorithm, respectively. In the same order in the window opening scenario, the base algorithm (3,049 kWh) > adaptive control algorithm (2,889 kWh) > non-adaptive control algorithm (2,703 kWh) appeared in the same order. In the case of cooling, the base, non-adaptive, and adaptive control algorithms consumed 1,035 kWh, 870 kWh, and 763 kWh of energy in the same order as heating in the unopened window scenario, respectively. Scenario forcing disturbance was similarly large in the order of base (895 kWh), adaptive (760 kWh), and non-adaptive algorithm (760 kWh). Fan energy is as follows for each scenario: 1) In the unopened window scenario, adaptive control (365 kWh) > base control (362 kWh) > non-adaptive control algorithm (336 kWh) consumes the most; 2) On the other hand, in the open window scenario, the highest consumption was in the order of base control (359 kWh) > adaptive control (353.09 kWh) > non-adaptive control (318.47 kWh). This energy consumption result occurs because INN-based algorithms use heuristics to infer energy indirectly and reflect its saving intensity in control decision-making. In addition, INN-based algorithms dynamically controlled the indoor thermal conditions via the setpoint searching method mentioned above to prevent overheating and overcooling [Figs. 21, 22 ]. 4 Discussion The results under both scenarios of this study show that the utilization of adaptive learning is necessary and should be considerately designed considering the high uncertainty inherent to space. The seasonal adjustment of the proposed strategy calibrated the prediction model parameters suitable for different HVAC operations. However, the parameter correction for adapting somewhat lagged in immediate periods after seasonal changes. This means that the sliding window technique is limited in not agilely calibrating a prediction model. Thus, a high-quality adaptive learning dataset is essential, and the method should be prepared, maximizing the generalization performance of prediction models via error compensation. In addition, in terms of using the sliding window technique, the window size or learning weight selection in re-training needs an adequate adjustment for rapid responses to disturbances. Finally, an active method to correct the intensity (e.g., changing the error weights and adjusting hyper-parameters according to prediction error) of the model training should be devised to ensure both high prediction accuracy and agile calibration speeds of the prediction model. 5 Conclusion This study aimed at developing an intelligent integrated-control strategy for school buildings to optimize IEQ and the energy consumption of a HVAC system. To this end, the main consequences of this research are as follows: (1) The period of control failure for the proposed approach when the windows were closed year-round was 1,665 min for PMV (1.64% of the overall simulation period), 0 min for CO2 and PM10, and 30 min for PM2.5 (0.03%). When the windows were opened regularly, the PMV, CO2, PM10, and PM2.5 control failure period was 9,610 min (9.48%), 0 min, 5,240 min (5.17%), and 7,285 min (7.18%), respectively. (2) Due to the gradual improvement in the accuracy of the prediction model utilizing adaptive learning, it maintained a PMV close to the neutral point (μ: −0.1018, σ: 0.3214), maintained an indoor CO2 concentration below 700 ppm for the entire period, and greatly reduced the PM levels (PM10: μ: 5.6052 μg/m3 and σ: 9.9041; PM2.5: 6.8470 μg/m3 and σ: 5.2989). (3) When the windows were closed, the control algorithm used less heating and cooling energy than the base algorithm: 2,467.07 kWh (91.1% compared to the base algorithm) and 870.26 kWh (84.08%) for heating and cooling. The main findings of this study are following: First, for multi-objective predictive control, the proposed model can reduce the time required for model development compared to the MISO ensemble approach and has high fitness because it can prevent spurious regression that occurs when using the existing MIMO model. Second, employing a continuous weight function and cost function in the control decision stage can optimize the operation of the HVAC system while decreasing conflicts in control decisions by reasonable prioritization. Accordingly, this control algorithm has the potential utility in actively responding to disturbances or sudden environmental changes by reconciling the conflicts between objectives in control decision-making. Third, the algorithm confirmed that smooth integrated control of buildings throughout the year is possible even with a single prediction model via the seasonal parameter adjustment. This showed that the proposed method can break away from the cumbersomeness of altering or adjusting models due to shifts of HVAC operations schedule according to season. Despite the significance of these findings, there are several limitations of this study that are important to note. The data used to develop the prediction model was acquired from computer simulations rather than field measurements. There is a clear gap between actual building operations and those derived from a computer simulation. In further research, the more objective acquisition process will be devised to secure high generality and applicability in using a model based on the proposed strategy. Also, a calibrated simulation model will be developed to acquire more reliable data for training the prediction models, that can effectively imitate the physical behavior of the actual building. The results and conclusions of this study clearly suggest that further research is necessary to secure the applicability of the proposed integrated control strategy. Thus, as an extension of this study, it will be persisted to ensure the generalization performance of this control strategy not only for educational spaces but also for various spaces with different physical characteristics. Specifically, it includes processes to relatively objectify the selection process of weight functions and control operation boundary conditions for providing this strategy to users with convenience and improved performance without barriers.

        "dc:description": "In South Korea, school buildings require significant energy inputs for heating and air-conditioning, and the majority of the occupants are adolescent students, whose health and cognitive performance are vulnerable to poor indoor air quality (IAQ) and thermal discomfort. Using field measurements, some previous studies have reported that some Korean schools have poor IAQ and thermal conditions. Thus, it is necessary to develop effective heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) control strategies to improve the indoor environment and reduce energy consumption. Therefore, this study proposes an intelligent HVAC integrated control strategy that can improve indoor environmental quality (IEQ) and reduce energy consumption in school buildings. The proposed strategy utilizes an integrated neural network prediction model for IEQ and a heuristic method that can optimize control objectives (i.e., the predicted mean vote [PMV], carbon dioxide [CO2], particulate matter with diameters of 10 and 2.5 μm [PM10 and PM2.5, respectively], and HVAC energy consumption). To evaluate the control performance of the proposed strategy, the present study employs two base algorithms (i.e., a rule-based and a non-adaptive control approach) under non-disturbance and forcing disturbance scenarios. The control failure period for PMV is found to be 1.6420% and 9.4773% of the total occupancy period under the non-disturbance and forcing disturbance scenarios, respectively, while CO2 control failure does not occur under either scenario. The control failure periods for PM10 and PM2.5 were 5.1676%, and 7.1844%, respectively, under forcing disturbance. Under the non-disturbance scenario, the proposed strategy consumed 2,467.07 kWh and 870,26 kWh for heating and cooling, respectively, representing 91.1% and 84.08% of that for the rule-based algorithm. The proposed strategy can thus effectively improve the IEQ of a building and has the potential for use in the development of integrated environmental management solutions for buildings.",
