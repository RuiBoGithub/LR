Data driven-based methods have aroused wide attention in the domain of fault detection and diagnosis of heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems. However, they are good at learning statistical relationships between faults and symptoms rather than their causal relationships, resulting in poor interpretability. This paper proposes a causal discovery and inference-based fault detection and diagnosis method to address this challenge. It applies a do-calculus-based individual average causal effect estimation approach to reveal causal relationships between faults and symptoms. Based on the causal relationships discovered, a backward structural causal model is developed for fault detection and diagnosis. Regression coefficients in the model are visualized using heatmaps to explain the model reasoning processes. The method is validated using the experimental data collected by the ASHARE project RP-1312. The individual average causal effect estimation approach reveals the causal relationships between eleven air handing unit faults and twenty-eight symptoms successfully. The diagnosis accuracy of the backward structural causal model (99.58%) is almost as high as that of k-nearest neighbors, support vector machine, classification and regression trees, deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks. Its hyper-parameter optimization time is reduced by 81.64% and 99.91%, respectively, compared with deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks. And its model training time is reduced by 38.61% and 92.01%, respectively. Based on the heatmap of regression coefficients of the model, it is demonstrated that the decision-making processes of the model are understandable and consistent with the domain knowledge in most cases.

As the largest energy consumer in the world, the building sector is responsible for more than one-third of the global energy usage [2]. Of this amount, about 40%\u201380% of energy used in buildings is consumed by heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems [3]. However, malfunctions in HVAC systems generally waste about 15%\u201330% of energy utilized in commercial buildings [4]. It is pressing to develop advanced fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) technologies for HVAC systems to reduce energy usage in buildings [5]. Many FDD solutions have been presented for HVAC systems in the past decades [6]. They can be divided into two categories: knowledge driven-based and data driven-based [7]. Knowledge driven-based methods aim to simulate experts' diagnostic logic. Building a knowledge driven-based FDD model, such as rules-based [8] and Bayesian networks-based [9], requires a deep understanding of causal relations between faults and symptoms. Extensive human intervention is necessary for knowledge driven-based methods [10]. They might be suitable for FDD of simple HVAC systems. However, it will be quite time-consuming to implement such methods if the structure of a HVAC system is complex. With the popularity of building management systems, operational data of HVAC systems are easily available, contributing to the booming development of data driven-based FDD methods. The main advantage of such methods is that they don't rely on humans, so that they are more flexible and feasible in practice [11]. Support vector machine (SVM) is one of the most popular data driven-based algorithms for FDD. It has been adopted for FDD of variable refrigerant flow air conditioning systems [12], chillers [13], cooling dehumidifiers [14] and so on. Apart from SVM, classification and regression trees (CART) [15] and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) [16,17] also have been applied for diagnosing faults in HVAC systems. Recently, with the rapid development of computer science, deep learning has shown great capabilities on FDD of HVAC systems. Deep neural networks (DNN) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) are the two most representative deep learning algorithms in this domain. Lee et al. found that a DNN model composed of seven fully connected layers could diagnose air handling unit (AHU) faults with high accuracy [18]. Li et al. demonstrated that a one-dimensional CNN model could learn statistical relationships between chillers' faults and their symptoms effectively [19]. This model achieved great performance in diagnosing chillers' faults. Although various types of data driven-based FDD methods are derived from distinct mathematical theories, most of them can achieve very high diagnosis accuracy for HVAC systems. According to the research of Zhou et al., the average fault diagnosis correct rates of CART, SVM and DNN were 97.94%, 99.86% and 99.99%, respectively, for a variable refrigerant flow system [20]. Yan et al. also revealed that the detection accuracy of KNN, SVM and three-layer neural networks were 99.75%, 99.92% and 99.83%, respectively, for AHU faults [21]. Similarly, Eom et al. investigated the fault diagnosis accuracy of CNN and DNN on a commercial air source heat pump system [22]. They discovered that CNN and DNN had very high accuracy, i.e., 99.9% and 98.0%, respectively. High diagnosis accuracy of these methods results from their complex structures which can learn extremely complicated statistical relationships between faults and symptoms. Nevertheless, the complex structures incur poor interpretability. They cannot learn causal relationships between faults and symptoms, so it is hard for technicians to understand them. Without good interpretability, technicians cannot trust a data driven-based FDD model even if it has very high diagnosis accuracy. Several efforts have been made to interpret data driven-based FDD models. They can be classified into post-hoc interpretability methods and intrinsic interpretability methods [23]. Post-hoc interpretability aims to explain data driven-based models in indirect ways such as gradient-based visualization or surrogate models. Li et al. applied an absolute gradient-weighted class activation mapping approach to explain CNN-based chiller FDD models in a visual way [19]. It adopted gradient information to calculate the importance degrees of features in the final convolutional layer. The importance degrees were visualized using a heatmap. Madhikermi et al. [24] and Srinivasan et al. [25] used a local interpretable model-agnostic explanations approach to interpret data driven-based FDD models of HVAC systems. Its core idea was to learn a local interpretable surrogate model, such as a linear model, that could approximate outputs of an unexplainable data driven-based FDD model. The unexplainable model was explained based on the interpretable model. However, intrinsic decision-making processes of data driven-based models are still unexplainable for post-hoc interpretability methods. Hence, intrinsic interpretability methods, i.e., development of interpretable data driven-based models, might be better solutions for FDD. Decision trees (such as CART) and logistic regression are the two most representative intrinsic interpretability methods for classification tasks [26]. However, they might be unsuitable for multiple fault diagnosis tasks. A decision tree needs lots of nodes to learn complex relationships between multiple faults and their symptoms. It becomes quite difficult for a human to understand a complex decision tree with so many nodes [27]. As for logistic regression, it is always applied for binary classification tasks rather than multiple fault diagnosis tasks [28]. Accordingly, effective interpretable data driven-based models are still lacking but extremely valuable in this domain. This study attempts to propose a data driven-based FDD method with good interpretability and high diagnosis accuracy to bridge the above vital gap. It is inspired by diagnostic thinking of experts. Experts firstly need to find out significant symptoms of faults to be diagnosed. Then, they try to develop causal inference chains between faults and symptoms in their mind. Based on the causal inference chains, they can determine which fault might occur when several symptoms are observed. To simulate the experts\u2019 diagnostic thinking, a causal discovery and inference-based FDD method is proposed. It adopts a do-calculus-based individual average causal effect estimation approach to discover symptoms that faults affect significantly. After that, a backward structural causal model is developed to learn computable causal inference chains between multiple faults and their significant symptoms for FDD. It is an intrinsically interpretable model for fault diagnosis tasks. The experimental data collected by the ASHARE project RP-1312 are utilized to evaluate the performance of this method. Five traditional data driven-based FDD methods (KNN, SVM, CART, DNN and CNN) are selected for performance comparison. Three major contributions of this work are summarized as follows: ● The proposed method can discover and learn causal relationships between faults and symptoms using do-calculus and backward structural causal models. It has better interpretability and reliability than traditional data driven-based methods, as traditional methods learn statistical relationships between faults and symptoms rather than causal relationships between them. ● The complexity of the backward structural causal model is significantly lower than that of some complex data driven-based methods such as DNN and CNN. The low complexity reduces its time of hyper-parameter optimization as well as model training dramatically. However, its diagnosis accuracy is still as high as DNN, CNN and other common data driven-based methods (KNN, CART and SVM). ● In a backward structural causal model, a causal relationship between a fault and a symptom has excellent interpretability and is independent with other faults/symptoms. Therefore, such model has better transferability than traditional data driven-based models. Traditional models are difficult to be shared if they are learned from various HVAC systems, as the dimensions of faults and symptoms change. Backward structural causal models can solve this issue well. They can share partial causal relationships between the same faults and symptoms in various systems. 2 Methodology The flow chart of the causal discovery and inference-based FDD method is illustrated in Fig. 1 . It includes four steps: data preprocessing (Section 2.1), causal discovery (Section 2.2), causal inference (Section 2.3) and model interpretation (Section 2.4). 2.1 Data preprocessing Transient operational data collected during the time of startup, shutdown and mode switch of HVAC systems are worthless and even harmful for training FDD models [29]. Therefore, it is necessary to filter out such data before causal discovery and inference. This study adopts a moving window slope-based steady-state detector to remove transient operational data [30]. Transient operation of HVAC systems can generally be detected based on some system state parameters, such as cooling/heating coil valve open position, supply fan speed and supply air temperature/static pressure [29]. The steady-state detector calculates the slopes of such parameters to identify transient operational data. A slope of a parameter in a moving window is defined by Eq. (1). The slopes of these parameters are then summed. If the summed value exceeds a given threshold, the system operation in the moving window is identified as transient. The operational data within the moving window are removed. (1) k = x max − x min x m e a n where, k is the slope of a parameter in a moving window, and x max, x min and x mean are the maximum, minimum and average value of the parameter in the moving window, respectively. 2.2 Individual average causal effect estimation-based causal discovery 2.2.1 Definition of individual average causal effect Intervention has been proven to be one of the most effective solutions to establish causality [31]. Do-calculus, a causality calculation approach proposed by Pearl [32], has been widely utilized to calculate an effect of an intervention. It introduces a do-operator to calculate the probability that Y equals to y when an intervention is introduced to make X equal to x, defined as P(Y = y|do(X = x)). Based on do-calculus, an average causal effect of X on Y is defined as the difference between P(Y = y|do(X = x 1)) and P(Y = y|do(X = x 2)). It quantifies the difference between two interventions, i.e., making X equal to x 1 and x 2, respectively [33]. An average causal effect is generally calculated based on samples collected from many individuals rather than an individual [34]. On the contrary, in the domain of FDD of HVAC systems, faulty and normal samples are usually collected from an individual HVAC system. To distinguish the difference between them, a term named \u201cindividual average causal effect\u201d is adopted to denote an average causal effect of a fault on a symptom in an individual HVAC system. 2.2.2 Criteria of individual average causal effect estimation Three criteria are developed to estimate an individual average causal effect of a fault on a symptom in an individual HVAC system, including a probability-based estimation criterion, mode-based estimation criterion and expectation-based estimation criterion. The probability-based individual average causal effect (PIACE) is defined by Eq. (2). As shown in Fig. 2 , a PIACE of a fault on a symptom is the percentage of samples from one intervention that can be distinguished from samples from another intervention. The greater a PIACE of a fault on a symptom is, the more faulty samples can be isolated from normal samples based on the symptom, that is, the greater the causal effect of the fault on the symptom. Numerical data of a symptom are transformed into categorical data for estimating PIACE more easily. Some data transformation approaches have been proposed such as equal-width binning, equal-frequency binning and kernel density estimation-based transformation [35]. Equal-width binning is applied to ensure that interval partitions are the same for both faulty and normal data. (2) P I A C E = 1 2 ∑ i = 0 N 1 | P ( S = s i | d o ( F = 1 ) ) − P ( S = s i | d o ( F = 0 ) ) | where, S is a symptom, F is a fault, N 1 is the number of intervals, and P(S = s i |do(F = 1)) and P(S = s i |do(F = 0)) represent probabilities that S is within the ith interval (s i ) when an intervention is introduced to make the fault occur (F = 1) and not (F = 0), respectively. PIACE estimates an individual average causal effect from a probabilistic perspective. However, it might be biased if only one perspective is considered. For instance, although the PIACE of the symptom 1 in Fig. 3 (a) is similar to that of the symptom 2 in Fig. 3 (b), their distributions are significantly different. Hence, expectation and mode are taken into consideration for estimating individual average causal effects from a non-probabilistic perspective. The expectation-based individual average causal effect (EIACE) and mode-based individual average causal effect (MIACE) are defined by Eqs. (3) and (4), respectively. Their values are normalized into the range of 0\u20131 for determining their thresholds more conveniently. The greater their values are, the greater the geometric distance between symptom distributions of faulty and fault-free conditions is. Considering calculating the mode of categorical data is usually easier and more reliable than that of numerical data, equal-width binning is applied to convert numerical data of symptoms into categorical data when MIACE is calculated. The mode of a set of data points is defined as the average of the upper and lower boundaries of an interval with the most samples. (3) E I A C E = | E ( S ( d o ( F = 1 ) ) ) − E ( S ( d o ( F = 0 ) ) ) | S max − S min (4) M I A C E = | a r g m a x x P ( S = x | d o ( F = 1 ) ) − a r g m a x x P ( S = x | d o ( F = 0 ) ) | S max − S min where, S max is the maximum of a symptom, S min is the minimum of the symptom, and a r g m a x x is an operation to find the x that maximizes a target function. E(S(do(F = 1))) and E(S(do(F = 0))) are two expectations of the symptom when two interventions are introduced to make the fault occur (F = 1) and not occur (F = 0), respectively. P(S = x|do(F = 1)) and P(S = x|do(F = 0)) are two probabilities of S equaling to x when two interventions are introduced to make the fault occur and not occur, respectively. 2.2.3 Causal structure learning based on individual average causal effect estimation A causal structure learning strategy is developed to learn the causal relationships between multiple faults and various symptoms, as shown in Fig. 4 . Three rules listed as follows are established to estimate an individual average causal effect of a fault on a symptom based on its PIACE, EIACE and MIACE: ● Rule 1: If the PIACE is less than the first threshold, the fault doesn't have a significant individual average causal effect on the symptom. ● Rule 2: If the maximum of EIACE and MIACE is less than the second threshold, the fault doesn't have a significant individual average causal effect on the symptom. ● Rule 3: If the PIACE is greater than the first threshold and the maximum of EIACE and MIACE is greater than the second threshold, the fault has a significant individual average causal effect on the symptom. Individual average causal effects between multiple faults and their symptoms are estimated using the above three rules. A causal structure graph is then established after obtaining every individual average causal effect. A causal structure graph is a directed acyclic graph composed of fault nodes, symptom nodes and directed edges. A fault node represents a type of fault. A symptom node denotes a type of symptom. A significant causal relation between a fault and symptom is described by a directed edge from the fault to the symptom. Accordingly, a causal structure graph can be generated automatically through connecting fault nodes and symptom nodes using directed edges. A fault node is connected to a symptom node if the fault has a significant individual average causal effect on the symptom. 2.3 Backward structural causal model-based causal inference 2.3.1 Definition of backward structural causal models Structural causal models are graphical models consisting of a set of nodes representing causes and effects, and a set of edges representing functional relationships between causes and effects [33]. Each edge has a regression coefficient to quantify a causal effect of a cause on an effect. The direction of an edge is always from a cause X to an effect Y, which means \u201cX causes Y\u201d. Fig. 5 illustrates an example of a structural causal model that represents relationships between the salary and abilities of an employee [33]. The years of schooling (X 1) and years in the profession (X 2) are two crucial causes of the salary of an employee (Y). Some unknown causes (U) of the salary are also considered in the structural causal model. The functional relationship among them is Y = aX 1 + bX 2 + U, where a, b and U are regression coefficients. FDD aims to detect and diagnosis faults (causes) based on symptoms (effects), which is a backward inference process (from effects to causes). Nevertheless, inference processes in a structural causal model are from causes to effects, which is inappropriate for FDD. A term named \u201cbackward structural causal model\u201d is created for FDD. Different from a structural causal model, inference processes in a backward structural causal model are from effects to causes. Fig. 6 shows a structural causal model and a backward structural causal model for a fault. Similar to a structural causal model, a backward structural causal model is composed of fault nodes, symptom nodes and edges. A sigmoid function 1 1 + e − x is applied as an activation function of a fault node, because diagnosis of a fault is a binary classification task in essence. 2.3.2 Regression coefficient learning for a backward structural causal model The structure and regression coefficients need to be learned for a backward structural causal model. The structure is generated by reversing the directions of edges in a causal structure graph (Section 2.2.3). After that, two types of regression coefficients (weights and biases) are optimized to obtain a computable backward structural causal model for FDD. Gradient-based optimization algorithms are the most common technologies for handling such tasks in the machine learning domain [36]. The most popular ones of them are stochastic gradient descent (SGD), RMSProp, AdaGrad, AdaDelta and Adam [37]. Among them, Adam is usually regarded as the most advanced optimizer that combines the advantages of AdaGrad and RMSProp [38]. It usually showed faster convergence rate and higher accuracy than the other four algorithms [38]. Hence, Adam is used in this study to optimize regression coefficients in a backward structural causal model. The flow chart of an Adam-based regression coefficient optimization process is shown in Fig. 7 . It includes five steps. Its first step is to initialize the regression coefficients of a backward structural causal model. Secondly, the probability of each fault occurring on each sample from the training set is predicted by the model. As shown in Fig. 7, each sample in the training set corresponds to a specific fault condition or fault-free condition. Values of symptoms on a sample are inputted into the model for predicting the probability of each fault occurring on the sample. Then, a customized cross entropy loss function, defined by Eq. (5), is calculated to evaluate the performance of the model. The term in the parenthesis of Eq. (5) is a cross entropy loss for binary classification. It defines the difference between the predicted probability and actual probability of a fault occurring on a sample. Eq. (5) is the average of the values of this term of all faults on all samples. The smaller Eq. (5) is, the higher the diagnosis accuracy of the model is. After calculating Eq. (5), an Adam optimizer is utilized to calculate the bias-corrected terms of the regression coefficients based on the gradients of the loss function [38]. Lastly, the regression coefficients are updated based on the bias-corrected terms. Steps 2\u20135 are iterated until the model is converged. In this study, a model is regarded as converged if the decrease rate of the loss function on the validation set is less than a threshold (a very small value) for several times. (5) L = 1 N 2 × N 3 ∑ i = 1 N 2 ∑ j = 1 N 3 ( − ( P i ( F j = 1 ) × log 2 ( P ˆ i ( F j = 1 ) + ε ) + ( 1 − P i ( F j = 1 ) ) × log 2 ( 1 − P ˆ i ( F j = 1 ) + ε ) ) ) where, N 2 is the number of samples on the training set, N 3 is the number of faults, P i (F j = 1) is the actual probability that the jth fault occurs on the ith sample, P ˆ i (F j = 1) is the predicted probability that the jth fault occurs on the ith sample, and ε is a parameter with a very small value to prevent the value in the logarithm function equaling to 0. Various symptoms usually have different scales. They might contribute unequally to outputs of a backward structural causal model. Therefore, min-max normalization is adopted for rescaling ranges of symptoms into an interval between 0 and 1 before regression coefficient optimization. With the help of min-max normalization, regression coefficients in a backward structural causal model can be utilized to explain contributions of symptoms without bias. 2.3.3 Fault detection and diagnosis based on the optimal backward structural causal model A FDD strategy is developed based on the backward structural causal model with optimal regression coefficients. It contains two steps shown as follows: ● Fault detection: If the occurrence probability of every fault is less than a given threshold, the system is fault-free. Otherwise, the system suffers from a fault. ● Fault diagnosis: If the system suffers from a fault, the fault with the maximum occurrence probability is identified as the final diagnosis result. 2.4 Regression coefficient visualization for interpreting a backward structural causal model A backward structural causal model essentially utilizes multiple logistic regression functions to calculate occurrence probabilities of multiple faults. Logistic regression functions are interpretable functions in the machine learning field [39]. In general, the term P ˆ ( F = 1 ) P ˆ ( F = 0 ) represents the predicted probability of a fault occurring divided by that of a fault not occurring. The greater this term is, the more possible the fault is to occur. As defined by Eq. (6), this term can be calculated using a linear function related to regression coefficients. If a regression coefficient of a symptom is positive for a fault, the symptom has a positive contribution to the occurrence of the fault. Otherwise, the symptom has a negative contribution to the occurrence of the fault. The greater the absolute value of a regression coefficient of a symptom is for a fault, the more the symptom contributes to the fault. A maximum-absolute-value-based normalization approach, defined by Eq. (7), is further put forward to normalize raw regression coefficients of symptoms of a fault into an interval between −1 and 1. It can make the comparison among various regression coefficients easier to understand. To visualize the normalized regression coefficients, heatmaps are applied to depict them by different colors (Fig. 1). (6) ln ( P ˆ ( F = 1 ) P ˆ ( F = 0 ) ) = ln ( P ˆ ( F = 1 ) 1 − P ˆ ( F = 1 ) ) = ln ( 1 1 + e − ( w 1 × S 1 + w 2 × S 2 + \u2026 + w n × S n + U ) 1 − 1 1 + e − ( w 1 × S 1 + w 2 × S 2 + \u2026 + w n × S n + U ) ) = w 1 × S 1 + w 2 × S 2 + \u2026 + w n × S n + U (7) z i = z i max j = 1,2 , \u2026 , n + 1 ( a b s ( z j ) ) where, P ˆ (F = 1) represents the predicted probability that a fault occurs, P ˆ (F = 0) represents the predicted probability that a fault doesn't occur, S is a known symptom, U is an unknown symptom (a bias), w is a weight, z i is the ith weight/bias of a symptom related to a fault, and z j is the jth weight/bias of the symptom. 3 Evaluation 3.1 Descriptions of the experimental data The experimental data from the ASHARE project RP-1312 are adopted for performance verification [40]. In this project, a test facility in a commercial building was adopted to generate faulty and normal operational data of AHUs. As shown in Fig. 8 , it included two identical test AHUs (AHU-A and AHU-B). Zones served by the AHU-A and AHU-B were mirror images that had identical external thermal loads and construction. The test AHUs were composed of the supply fan, return fan, heating coil, cooling coil, filter, recirculation air damper, exhaust air damper and outdoor air damper (Fig. 9 ). Four types of sensors were installed to monitor the test AHUs, including temperature sensors, relative humidity sensors, flow rate sensors and pressure sensors. This project manually introduced faults into the AHU-A while the operation of the AHU-B was fault-free [40]. Faulty and normal data were collected from the two AHUs with a sampling interval of 1 min. The two AHUs were identical and operated simultaneously to avoid the interference by outdoor weather conditions, system configuration and system control strategies. The data set from this project is very suitable for verifying the proposed method, since the data set is generated from two interventions (making a fault occur in the AHU-A and not occur in the AHU-B). The experimental data of eleven typical faults (Table 1 ) in the AHU-A collected in the summer of 2017 are selected for evaluation. The fault-free experimental data from the AHU-B are also adopted. The two AHUs operated from 6:00 to 18:00. The minimum position of the outdoor air damper was 40%. The return fan speed was set as 80% of the supply fan speed. The set points of the supply air static pressure and temperature were set as 9.65 kPa and 12.78 °C, respectively. Nineteen available variables (Table 2 ) are selected as symptoms. Moreover, standard deviations of two crucial set points and states of seven actuators in a moving window (Table 3 ) are utilized as additional symptoms to quantify effects of faults on operational stability of AHUs. The moving window size is set as 10 min in this study, as a steep increase/decrease of the measured variables in the two AHUs usually lasts for about 10 min. 3.2 Data preprocessing results A moving window slope-based steady-state detector described in Section 2.1 is developed to remove transient operational data. Five key system state variables, i.e., the heating coil valve position, cooling coil valve position, supply air temperature, supply air static pressure and supply fan speed, are chosen as its inputs [29]. The moving window size of the detector is set to 10 min, considering a steep increase/decrease of the five variables usually continues for around 10 min. The threshold of the sum of the five parameters\u2019 slopes is set as 0.4 based on trial and error. The number of the steady samples in each experiment is listed in Table 4 . The steady samples in each experiment are randomly put into a training set (60%), validation set (20%) and testing set (20%). 3.3 Causal structure graphs learned using individual average causal effect estimation After data preprocessing, the steady samples of eleven faults (Table 1) and twenty-eight symptoms (Tables 2 and 3) are utilized for learning the causal relationships among them. The three rules described in Section 2.2.3 are adopted to construct a causal structure graph related to the eleven faults and twenty-eight symptoms. The thresholds of criteria for individual average causal effect estimation are determined according to domain knowledge and engineering experience. The threshold of the PIACE is set as 50.00%, indicating that at least half of the samples from a fault can be isolated from the corresponding fault-free samples. It denotes that the diagnosis accuracy of this fault can be more than 50.00% (better than a random guess) even if only this symptom is utilized. The threshold of the maximum of EIACE and MIACE is set to 5.00%. Some factors, such as various outdoor/indoor environment and data noise, might result in a slight difference between the distribution of a symptom under a faulty condition and that under a fault-free condition. EIACE and MIACE are utilized to remove a symptom of a fault whose distribution under the faulty condition are slightly different from that under the fault-free condition. Such symptoms and faults usually have very weak causality. Therefore, the threshold of the maximum of EIACE and MIACE is set to a relatively small level in this study. Equal-width binning is adopted to transform the numerical data of symptoms into categorical data. Table 5 lists the range of an interval of each symptom, which is determined according to the difference between the maximum and minimum of each symptom. The causal structure graph learned from the steady samples is shown in Fig. 10 . To clarify the reliability of the individual average causal effect estimation strategy, the changes of significant symptoms of a typical fault (F 6) are shown in Fig. 11 , as this fault has abundant significant symptoms discovered. F 6 indicates that the cooling coil valve is stuck at the minimum position. The cooling coil valve position (S 2) and its standard deviation in a moving window (S 23) are always 0.00% when this fault occurs. Since the cooling coil valve is fully closed, the energy consumption of the cooling coil (S 18) is always 0.00 kW. This fault results in higher supply air temperature (S 9) and lower supply air relative humidity (S 15), so that the indoor air temperature is higher than the set point. The return air temperature (S 11) and mixed air temperature (S 10) both increase with the increase of the indoor air temperature. To maintain the indoor air temperature, the dampers of variable air volume boxes open at a greater position. It reduces the supply air static pressure (S 12). The supply fan speed (S 13) increases to 100.00% for maintain the supply air static pressure. Supply air flow rate (S 6) and supply fan power (S 16) both increase with the increase of the supply fan speed. Increasing the supply fan speed also leads to a larger outdoor air flow rate (S 8). In this system, the return fan speed (S 14) is controlled to be 80.00% of the supply fan speed. Hence, the return fan speed increases to 80.00% when this fault occurs. Due to the increase of the return fan speed, return air flow rate (S 7) and return fan power (S 17) both increase. 3.4 Performance of backward structural causal models 3.4.1 Baseline models for performance comparison Five common data driven-based FDD models (KNN, CART, SVM, DNN and CNN) are selected as baseline models. The twenty-eight symptoms listed in Tables 2 and 3 are selected as their inputs. Their outputs have twelve classes, i.e., F 1, F 2, \u2026, F 11 and N (normal). The diagnosis accuracy and computational cost of the five models are compared with those of backward structural causal models. KNN, CART and SVM are three common machine learning algorithms. KNN classifies an unknown sample into a class to which k similar known samples belong. A hyper-parameter (k) needs to be optimized. CART learns a binary tree whose forks are split according to the information gain of inputs. The most important hyper-parameter of CART is the maximum depth of the tree. SVM can map raw data into a high-dimensional space using a kernel function for performing non-linear classification tasks. Three hyper-parameters of SVM usually need to be optimized, including the kernel function, regularization parameter (C) and kernel coefficient (gamma). DNN and CNN are two popular deep learning algorithms. DNN is a fully-connected neural network composed of an input layer, multiple hidden layers and an output layer. The softmax function is utilized in the output layer for FDD. There are usually four hyper-parameters in DNN, i.e., the activation function, number of neurons in hidden layers, number of hidden layers and learning rate of an optimizer. A one-dimensional CNN structure (Fig. 12 ) suggested by Jiao et al. [41] is utilized in this study. Six hyper-parameters are optimized for the one-dimensional CNN, including the activation function, size of the filter in a convolutional layer, number of channels in a convolutional layer, type of pooling operations, number of neurons in a fully-connected layer and learning rate of an optimizer. The Adam optimizer is used for DNN and CNN due to its fast convergence rate and good optimization performance [38]. The cross entropy loss function is adopted for training DNN and CNN models as suggested in Ref. [19]. 3.4.2 Comparison of hyper-parameter optimization performance The structure of a backward structural causal model is developed based on the causal structure graph shown in Fig. 10. A grid search technology is utilized to optimize the hyper-parameters of baseline models and the backward structural causal model. It trains multiple models with various groups of hyper-parameters on the training set. A group of hyper-parameters is regarded as the optimal one if it makes the model have the best performance on the validation set. Only a hyper-parameter (the learning rate of the Adam optimizer) needs to be optimized for the backward structural causal model. One machine learning library (scikit-learn) for Python is utilized to implement KNN, CART and SVM. Another deep learning library (PyTorch) for Python is applied to implement DNN, CNN and the backward structural causal model. DNN, CNN and the backward structural causal model are regarded as converged if the decrease rate of the loss function on the validation set is less than 10\u20135 for 10 times. A desktop computer that has a 3.4 GHz Intel Core i5 processor is selected as the computation tool. The optimal hyper-parameters of the six models are listed in Table 6 . The computational time of hyper-parameter optimization of the six models are shown in Table 7 . According to Table 7, the computational time of the backward structural causal model is significantly less than that of DNN and CNN. It only takes 18.36% and 0.09% of the computational time of DNN and CNN, respectively. The main reasons should be two-fold. Firstly, there are less weights and biases that need to be learned in the backward structural causal model than DNN and CNN. Secondly, the number of groups of hyper-parameters of the backward structural causal model is less than those of DNN and CNN. However, it takes more computational time than KNN, CART and SVM. It is reasonable since its complexity is higher than KNN, CART and SVM. 3.4.3 Comparison of fault detection and diagnosis performance Five baseline models and a backward structural causal model are trained on the training set using the optimal hyper-parameters. Training processes of DNN, CNN and the backward structural causal model will be stopped if the decrease rate of the loss function on the validation set is less than 10\u20135 for 10 times. Their training time is listed in Table 8 . Similar to the results of hyper-parameter optimization, the backward structural causal model has less training time than DNN and CNN but more training time than KNN, CART and SVM. The fault detection threshold (Section 2.3.3) of the backward structural causal model is set as 5.00% which shows the highest FDD accuracy among the options of 5.00%, 10.00%, 15.00%, 20.00%, 25.00% and 30.00%. The FDD accuracy of baseline models and the backward structural causal model on the testing set is shown using confusion matrixes (Fig. 13 ). An element n i,j in a confusion matrix indicates the percentage of the samples from the i-th true class (F 1, F 2, \u2026, F 11 or N) that are classified into the j-th class. Accordingly, a diagonal element in a confusion matrix indicates the percentage of the samples from a class that are correctly classified. The larger the diagonal element of a class is, the higher the diagnosis accuracy for this class is. The FDD accuracy of CART, SVM, DNN and CNN is 100.00% for each type of class. The backward structural causal model has 100.00% accuracy for diagnosing ten faults (F 1, F 2, \u2026, F 9 and F 11). Its accuracy for diagnosing F 10 and N is 97.00% and 98.00%, respectively. On average, its FDD accuracy on the twelve classes is 99.58% that is slightly lower than CART, SVM, DNN and CNN. Of the six models, the FDD accuracy of KNN is the lowest, i.e., 99.50% on average. It can be concluded that the FDD accuracy of the six models is similar and acceptable for practical applications. 3.5 Interpretation of backward structural causal models The normalized regression coefficients of the backward structural causal model are visualized using a heatmap (Fig. 14 ) to interpret the inference processes of the model. Based on the heatmap, in most cases, the model makes a decision that fits with the domain knowledge of FDD experts. Three typical faults are selected as examples to clarify the inference processes of the model, including an exhaust air damper fault (F 1), return fan fault (F 4) and cooling coil valve fault (F 7). The probability distributions of significant symptoms under faulty and fault-free conditions for the three faults are shown in Fig. 15 to validate the inference processes of the model. F 1 represents that an exhaust air damper is stuck at the maximum position. According to Fig. 14, the exhaust air damper position (S 3) has a significant positive contribution (0.88) to this fault. It means that this model will prefer to believe F 1 occurs if the value of S 3 is large. Comparing the faulty and normal data of S 3 shown in Fig. 15 (a), the position of the faulty exhaust air damper is 100.00%, while the position of the fault-free exhaust air damper is 40.00%. Therefore, this preference is reasonable. It is also discovered that the cooling coil energy consumption (S 18) has a moderate positive contribution (0.63) to this fault. It is reasonable since more indoor return air with relatively low temperature is vented to the outside of the building when this fault occurs. Therefore, more cooling energy is needed to ensure the supply air temperature, as shown in Fig. 15 (a). It is also discovered that the values of PIACE, EIACE and MIACE of S 18 are smaller than those of S 3. It explains why the contribution of S 18 is smaller than that of S 3. As for the outdoor air flow rate (S 8), its contribution is significantly lower than those of S 3 and S 18. As shown in Fig. 15 (a), PIACE and the maximum of EIACE and MIACE of S 8 are smaller than those of S 3 and S 18. F 4 indicates that a return fan is completely faulty. It is found that the return fan speed (S 14) has a significant negative contribution (−1.00) to this fault. The normalized regression coefficients of the return air flow rate (S 7) and return fan power (S 17) are −0.51 and −0.68, respectively. Their contributions are moderately negative for detecting and diagnosing this fault. It means that the model tends to report this fault when the three symptoms have relatively small values. It makes sense according to the domain knowledge. As shown in Fig. 15 (b), when this fault occurs, the return fan power and speed are 0.00 kW and 0.00%, respectively, and the return air flow rate significantly decreases. The values of EIACE and MIACE of S 14 are significantly larger than those of S 7 and S 17. It explains why the contribution of S 14 is significantly larger than those of S 7 and S 17. Apart from S 7, S 14 and S 17, the outdoor air flow rate (S 8), supply air relative humidity (S 15) and cooling coil energy consumption (S 18) have some positive contributions to this fault, i.e., 0.18, 0.14 and 0.19, respectively. And the standard deviation of the return fan speed in a moving window (S 28) has a slight negative contribution (−0.14) to this fault. They can be explained by domain knowledge according to Fig. 15 (b). This fault reduces the return air flow rate, resulting in more outdoor air is needed. More cold energy is required to cool the outdoor air. The standard deviation of the return fan speed is always 0.00 kW, since the return fan speed is a constant (0.00 kW). The outdoor air relative humidity is higher than the indoor air relative humidity in this building. Therefore, the supply air relative humidity increases when this fault occurs. The values of PIACE, EIACE and MIACE of these symptoms are smaller than those of S 7, S 14 and S 17, resulting in lower contributions of these symptoms. As for other symptoms, their contributions are very weak. A cooling coil valve is stuck at the maximum position when F 7 occurs. This fault has a significant positive correlation (1.00) with the cooling coil valve position (S 2). It is reasonable for this model to detect and diagnose this fault mainly based on S 2. As shown in Fig. 15 (c), the position of the cooling coil valve is 100.00% under this fault, while its position is between 20.00% and 60.00% if it is fault-free. The contributions of the exhaust air damper position (S 3), outdoor air damper position (S 5), outdoor air flow rate (S 8), mixed air temperature (S 10), supply air relative humidity (S 15) and standard deviation of the cooling coil valve position in a moving window (S 23) are negative and smaller than that of S 2. It also can be explained by domain knowledge according to Fig. 15 (c). When this fault occurs, the heating coil has to work for maintaining the supply air temperature. The outdoor air damper is closed due to a wrong system control strategy that forces the outdoor air damper closed when the heating coil works in summer. The exhaust air damper is also closed, since it should have the same position as the outdoor air damper. Therefore, the outdoor air flow rate decreases, leading to the lower mixed air temperature and supply air relative humidity. Moreover, as the cooling coil valve is stuck, the standard deviation of its position is always 0.00%. However, as shown in Fig. 15 (c), the values of EIACE and MIACE of the six symptoms are significantly smaller than those of S 2. It is the main reason that the contributions of the six symptoms are significantly smaller than that of S 2. According to Fig. 14, the reasons about the misdiagnosis of F 10 also can be explained. In this study, the diagnosis accuracy of the model is 97.00% for F 10, as shown in Fig. 13 (f). After analyzing the samples that are misdiagnosed, it is discovered that the cooling coil energy consumption (S 18) of these samples is significantly lower than that of other samples, since they are sampled from 6:30 a.m. to 7:30 a.m. when there are few people in rooms. As shown in Fig. 14, S 18 has the most significant positive correlation with this fault. It indicates that this model prefers to believe this fault will occur if S 18 is relatively high. This preference leads to the misdiagnosis of the faulty samples with low cooling coil energy consumption. Nevertheless, the inference processes of the model will be unreasonable sometimes. For instance, the model thinks the outdoor air flow rate (S 8) has a moderate positive contribution (0.58) to F 2. This inference is unreasonable according to the domain knowledge. F 2 represents that the exhaust air damper is stuck at the minimum position. It reduces the exhaust air flow rate, so that the recirculation air flow rate increases. The outdoor air flow rate has to decrease for maintaining the supply air flow rate. Therefore, the contribution of S 8 should be negative to F 2 according to the domain knowledge. Such mistakes don't affect the accuracy of the model. The main reason is that the model makes a decision according to multiple symptoms. It might have misconceptions about the contributions of some symptoms. However, its understandings about most symptoms are right, so that it still can make a right decision. 4 Discussions 4.1 Advantages of backward structural causal models Three main advantages of backward structural causal models are high diagnosis accuracy, low computational cost and good interpretability. They are discussed as follows: ● High diagnosis accuracy: After comparing the performance of a backward structural causal model with that of KNN, SVM, CART, DNN and CNN, it is discovered that the diagnosis accuracy of the backward structural causal model is very high (99.58%). It has very similar diagnosis accuracy to the five traditional models. ● Low computational cost: A backward structural causal model has less hyper-parameters to be optimized than DNN and CNN. Therefore, its computational time for optimizing hyper-parameters is significantly less than DNN and CNN. Its uncomplicated structure also decreases the number of weights and biases. Hence, it has less model training time than DNN and CNN. ● Good interpretability: The structure of DNN and CNN is very complex with lots of unexplainable operations such as fully connected layers and nonlinear activation in hidden layers. The complex structure makes it impossible for FDD experts to understand the information flow in DNN and CNN. A backward structural causal model is intrinsically interpretable. Its structure is quite simple without unexplainable operations. It is composed of multiple interpretable logistic regression functions. The regression coefficients of logistic regression functions reveal the intrinsic reasoning processes of a backward structural causal model. A positive coefficient indicates that the model thinks an increase of a symptom will increase the possibility of a fault occurring. A negative coefficient indicates that the model thinks an increase of a symptom will decrease the possibility of a fault occurring. The fourth advantage of backward structural causal models is good transferability. In practice, various HVAC systems usually have different structures with similar components. The types of symptoms and faults are usually somewhat different in various HVAC systems. A conventional data driven-based FDD model learned from one HVAC system usually cannot be transferred into another similar HVAC system with some different symptoms and faults, as the dimensions of model inputs and outputs change. This issue can be addressed well by backward structural causal models. A causal relationship between a fault and a symptom in such models is independent with other faults/symptoms and has excellent interpretability. Therefore, such models allow the causal relationships between the same faults and symptoms in various HVAC systems to be shared. Only the unique faults and symptoms in a certain HVAC system needs to be retrained. Based on this ability, a backward structural causal model learned from one HVAC system can be transferred into another HVAC system by adding or pruning its fault and symptom nodes. However, other factors such as control loops are not considered in this study. For instance, a backward structural causal model learned from one HVAC system with a certain control loop cannot be transferred into another HVAC system with significantly different control loops. More studies are needed in the future to explore the transferability of backward structural causal models. 4.2 Limitations of backward structural causal models According to the results in Section 3.5, a backward structural causal model might learn unreasonable relationships between a fault and a small part of its symptoms. Although it will not decrease the diagnosis accuracy of the model on known operation conditions, the model might make wrong decisions on some specific operation conditions. The mistakes of the model mainly result from the Adam algorithm that optimizes model regression coefficients according to classification accuracy without the constraint of domain knowledge. In the future, it is suggested to propose new model regression coefficient optimization algorithms that can consider the domain knowledge. It can improve the reliability and extrapolation ability of a backward structural causal model in FDD tasks. 5 Conclusions This paper proposes a causal discovery and inference-based fault detection and diagnosis method composed of two core parts, i.e., causal discovery and causal inference. An individual average causal effect estimation-based causal discovery approach is presented for discovering symptoms which a fault affects dramatically. A backward structural causal model-based causal inference approach is further developed to learn a reasoning model related to faults and their significant symptoms. A backward structural causal model is an intrinsically interpretable graph model consisting of reasoning paths and reasoning functions. Regression coefficients in the reasoning functions reveal contributions of symptoms to every fault. They are visualized by heatmaps for explaining a backward structural causal model. The experimental data from the ASHARE project RP-1312 are applied to verify the performance of this method. Eleven typical faults and twenty-eight symptoms are considered. The results show that the individual average causal effect estimation-based causal discovery approach reveals a causal structure graph between the eleven faults and twenty-eight symptoms successfully. A backward structural causal model is trained based on the causal structure graph. Its performance is compared with five traditional models, i.e., k-nearest neighbors, support vector machine, classification and regression trees, deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks. It is discovered that the diagnosis accuracy of the backward structural causal model is very high (99.58%). The diagnosis accuracy of the five traditional models is very close to that of the backward structural causal model. Due to the uncomplicated model structure, the backward structural causal model has less time for hyper-parameter optimization and model training than deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks. Its hyper-parameter optimization time is decreased by 81.64% and 99.91% compared with deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks, respectively. Its model training time is decreased by 38.61% and 92.01% compared with deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks, respectively. A heatmap of regression coefficients in the backward structural causal model is drawn for model interpretation. After analyzing the regression coefficients, it is demonstrated that the inference processes of the model are consistent with the domain knowledge in most cases. The data utilized for evaluation are collected from two experimental air handling units in this study. However, data with labels of faults are usually lacking for real heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems. It is necessary to investigate how to apply the proposed method in practice if the data with labels of faults are lacking. Moreover, only the experimental data collected from one day are utilized for performance evaluation of each fault case. More experimental data collected from different days with different outdoor and indoor conditions are needed in the future. The proposed method has four major advantages, i.e., high diagnosis accuracy, low computational cost, good interpretability and good transferability. However, this study just discusses the transferability of the backward structural causal model qualitatively, due to a lack of suitable data sets. Quantitative transferability evaluation is necessary in the future. Advanced optimization algorithms also should be studied for obtaining more reliable optimal regression coefficients by considering the domain knowledge. And automatic threshold optimization processes are suggested to be further studied for effective and convenient individual average causal effect estimation. Furthermore, it is valuable to investigate the potential of this method on other classification tasks.

        "dc:description": "Data driven-based methods have aroused wide attention in the domain of fault detection and diagnosis of heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems. However, they are good at learning statistical relationships between faults and symptoms rather than their causal relationships, resulting in poor interpretability. This paper proposes a causal discovery and inference-based fault detection and diagnosis method to address this challenge. It applies a do-calculus-based individual average causal effect estimation approach to reveal causal relationships between faults and symptoms. Based on the causal relationships discovered, a backward structural causal model is developed for fault detection and diagnosis. Regression coefficients in the model are visualized using heatmaps to explain the model reasoning processes. The method is validated using the experimental data collected by the ASHARE project RP-1312. The individual average causal effect estimation approach reveals the causal relationships between eleven air handing unit faults and twenty-eight symptoms successfully. The diagnosis accuracy of the backward structural causal model (99.58%) is almost as high as that of k-nearest neighbors, support vector machine, classification and regression trees, deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks. Its hyper-parameter optimization time is reduced by 81.64% and 99.91%, respectively, compared with deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks. And its model training time is reduced by 38.61% and 92.01%, respectively. Based on the heatmap of regression coefficients of the model, it is demonstrated that the decision-making processes of the model are understandable and consistent with the domain knowledge in most cases.",
