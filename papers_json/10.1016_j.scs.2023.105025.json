School of Architecture Southeast University Nanjing 210096 China Historic dwellings in cities are considered to be an important resource on the way to carbon neutrality because of their great potential for low-carbon renewal. However, in addition to obligatory heritage conservation requirements, there is no uniformity in historic dwellings\u2019 operation mode and conditioning equipment, which means detailed carbon emissions accounting is critical but challenging. To estimate the spatio-temporal distribution of carbon emissions from historic dwellings and thus support the development of decarbonization retrofit strategies, this research proposed a low-interventional carbon footprint accounting system based on a digital twin management platform. Multiple digital technologies are applied to monitor and evaluate the occupants\u2019 lifestyles, indoor environment, user location, and equipment energy consumption. Based on backend algorithms, the spatio-temporal distribution of carbon emissions is inserted into the building plan to graphically present the evaluation results. Compared with traditional simulation methods, the proposed system enables the automatic updating of energy accounting parameters by fusing multi-source data into one platform, improving accounting efficiency and accuracy simultaneously. A case study in China proves the outstanding performance of the accuracy of accounting results, with an approximate daily spatial error of 20 % and a total accounting error of less than 15 %.

As a major source of greenhouse gasses (GHGs) emissions, the building sector consumes nearly 40 % of the total energy used and makes up 30 % of total carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions globally (Hauashdh et al., 2022), which is considered as the key to addressing the issue of global warming. Building operation has been frequently identified as the phase with the most substantial potential for energy saving and emission reduction (Lin et al., 2018) while accurate carbon emission measurement (CEM) is fundamental to carbon reduction. There are a large number of traditional historic dwellings in cities. Considering they have a large share of carbon emissions (Fig. 1 ) and great potential for low-carbon renewal, such as sufficient rooftop resources for photovoltaic power, heritage dwellings are treated as an important resource on the road to carbon neutrality. With suitable retrofits, not only can these residences achieve net-zero carbon operation themselves, but also even power modern buildings in the future. In that case, accounting for the current carbon footprint seems essential for the future development of historic dwellings. However, compared to modern buildings, there are more uncertainties and challenges in estimating the carbon emissions of historic residences. First, due to the spontaneous and disorderly properties, historic dwellings normally lack construction standards and architectural drawings, which makes it more difficult to collect information (Qian & Leng, 2021). Moreover, many historic dwellings are shared by multiple families with different occupant compositions. Their operation mode can be summarized as \"partial space during the segmented time\" (Hu et al., 2021). Traditional statistical methods have a huge workload in the face of such complex and changing daily activities. In terms of the equipment energy consumption assessment, multiple researchers have proven the different environmental perceptions of occupants living in historic dwellings, such as the thermal comfort range (Xu et al., 2018). Meanwhile, unlike modern equipment that has unified energy-use modes, it is difficult to estimate the practical energy consumption of obsolete environmental conditioning equipment (Fabbri & Pretelli, 2014). Lastly, historic buildings contain unique architectural heritage values and should be managed and evaluated with low intervention (Martinez-Molina et al., 2016). As carbon accounting is the basis for the development of decarbonization strategies for heritage buildings, it is important to break through these limitations to realize year-round carbon emissions measurement. In terms of the existing research on historic building carbon emissions, some of them developed life-cycle estimation and evaluation from a macro perspective (Sim & Sim, 2017; Guidetti & Ferrara, 2023; Su et al., 2023), and some focused on the energy retrofit strategies (Moran et al., 2014; Pisello et al., 2016; Schibuola et al., 2018). However, fewer scholars explored the specific operational carbon footprint of historic dwellings. Even worse, most of them are still stuck in the overall accounting of the single buildings, and cannot achieve an assessment of the spatio-temporal distribution of carbon footprints. Scholars generally preferred to insert measured data (physical environment data, U-values, etc.) into the building energy model (Energyplus, Designbuilder, etc.) for simulation (Cho et al., 2022; Lin et al., 2023). Such accounting results are difficult to relate to heritage conservation, which is not conducive to the development of well-targeted design strategies. Considering the changing operation modes and occupants\u2019 lifestyles, limited static measured data cannot guarantee the accuracy of simulation results (Caro & Sendra, 2020). In terms of data processing, traditional approaches for processing measured data have poor interactivity and efficiency, while existing novel tools still have limitations in coupling energy evaluation results with multi-source building data (Ang et al., 2022; Bonilla et al., 2018). To sum up, the accuracy of existing simulation approaches is not acceptable since they cannot take all changing parameters affecting the carbon footprint into account. Considering there is a lack of research on spatio-temporal distribution of carbon footprint in the operation phase, the existing analysis for the historic residential energy retrofitting is weak in quantification and reproducibility. In response to the complex operation mode, historic dwellings urgently need a low-intervention integrated management system to combine all dynamic parameters together for carbon emission measurement. This research proposes a platform-based CO2 emission evaluation system for the operation stage of historic dwellings by coupling simulation with actual measurement. Multiple digital technologies are applied to solve the said measuring difficulties in turn. Afterward, based on the digital twin intelligent management platform, the fused multi-source heterogeneous data are capable of graphically presenting the carbon footprint distribution of historic dwellings to achieve the goal of assessing different spatial and temporal operational carbon emissions. This system provides an effective technology roadmap for CEM and decarbonization proposal generation for urban residences. To the authors\u2019 best knowledge, this work should be the first to explore the spatio-temporal distribution of carbon emissions from existing residences in complex operation modes. To ensure accuracy, the energy accounting parameters (e.g., occupants\u2019 locations) in the proposed algorithm are updated dynamically by the intelligent data acquisition system without much artificial intervention. The novel digital twin platform can rapidly insert the accounting results into the building plan and display them graphically. The contributions of this work can be listed as follows. (i) A user-friendly intelligent platform is introduced for historic dwellings to evaluate carbon emissions, enabling information integration, efficient calculations, and data traceability. (ii) The research provides a feasible technology roadmap for accurately estimating carbon emissions from existing buildings with complex operation modes. (iii) To handle the conflicts between heritage preservation and energy retrofit, this research proposes a digital route to identify the retrofit priorities through quantitative analysis of spatial carbon emission differences. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we conduct a literatuer review related to this research. Section 3 presents the entire theoretical framework with detailed algorithms and a technology roadmap. Specific implementation methods and parameter assignments are introduced with a case study in Section 4. The advantages and limitations are discussed in Sections 5, and 6 is the conclusion. 2 Literature review According to the widely recognized Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) theory (Rashid and Yusoff, 2015), the building life cycle is divided into four phases (materialization phase, construction phase, operation phase, and demolition phase) whereas the operation phase occupies nearly 80 % of all energy consumption (Chen & Bi, 2022) Accurate measurement of carbon emissions is fundamental to carbon reduction., which is of great importance. Since the end of the 20th century, governments and international organizations have proposed several widely applied standards for measuring carbon emissions at the country, city, and buildings scales, such as the International Standard for Determining GHG Emissions for Cities (UNEP et al., 2010), Carbon Footprint of Products (International Organization for Standardization, 2013), and Product Life Cycle Accounting and Reporting Standard (WRI & WBCSD, 2011). However, so far, no unified CEM method has been established. Based on the literature review (Fan et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2015; Ding et al., 2020), the following three methods are commonly adopted: Actual indicator measurement (AIM), Input-output model (IOM), and Emission coefficient method (ECM). Table 1 summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of these three quantification methodologies. In terms of the operation stage of residential buildings, in addition to taking into account the energy consumption systems, including heating and cooling, lighting, water heating, elevator, and cooking, carbon emissions should also consider the carbon reduction from renewable energy and carbon sink systems. Therefore, there are too many interfering factors for GHGs concentration monitoring if the AIM is applied, which means the accuracy cannot be guaranteed. The IOM theory based on the principle of mass conservation is mainly oriented to the macroscopic dimension. This system is more suitable for assessing the indirect carbon emissions by counting the inputs and outputs in the material production process, while it seems too loose for the CEM in the building operation phase (Onat et al., 2014). As to the ECM, proposed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2006), explicit algorithms have been introduced with an authoritative database of carbon emission factors (EF) and numerous precedents. Compared with the other two methodologies, the data required for ECM is easier to acquire. With the accumulation of research and databases, the assignment of emission factors becomes increasingly consistent and precise (Shen et al., 2014; Amaral et al., 2016). Thereby, the value of equipment energy consumption (Activity data, AD) in the building operation stage is the dominant element that determines the measurement accuracy. Therefore, the objective of the research is to accurately measure the energy consumption of historic residences at different times of the year based on the proposed digital twin platform. By clarifying the spatio-temporal distribution of the carbon footprint, effective decarbonization retrofit strategies can be developed because designers only have to focus on carbon-intensive spaces without intervening in others. Many scholars have confirmed the importance of low-carbon retrofitting of historic and traditional dwellings (Ding & Ying, 2019). Webb (2017) pointed out that energy retrofits in these buildings are seen not only as a way to reduce energy consumption but as a means of preserving them for future generations. A comprehensive review of existing studies on energy analysis of historic buildings\u2019 operational phase has been made by Lidelow et al. (2019). They emphasized cultural heritage values and highlighted the need to design best-practice approaches that balance the complex relationships between energy efficiency and heritage conservation of buildings. Admittedly, more and more scholars have drawn attention on the balance between energy retrofit and heritage conservation (Fig. 2 ). To comply with heritage conservation requirements, scholars have tried to break down the renewal tasks and capture the dominant elements. Okutan et al. (2018) proposed a socio-mathematical approach to evaluate the acceptability of 15 common retrofit measures, and found windproof retrofitting is the most acceptable. Moran et al. (2012) developed a database of energy use for historic buildings to analyze occupants\u2019 energy usage habits. Ginks and Painter (2017) explored carbon reduction methods through glazing retrofitting in order to reduce intervention in historic buildings. Nevertheless, these existing proposals are difficult to directly and systematically promote the development of decarbonization strategies. Based on the principle of reducing the impact on occupants\u2019 lives, it is more feasible to divide residences into spaces and determine the renewal focus according to the quantitative CEM. However, the existing analysis on the spatio-temporal distribution of carbon emissions is mostly carried out at the city level (Liu et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2023). The time-series CEM of the clustered spaces in a single historic building is not involved. To sum up, energy retrofits in historic buildings play an important role in both energy reduction and heritage preservation. In view of the current research basis of carbon emissions on historic dwellings, there is a lack of research on spatio-temporal distribution of carbon footprint in the operation phase, which should comprehensively take different dynamic parameters into account. Therefore, the research on developing an intelligent tool to account for the carbon emissions of historic dwellings accurately and effectively is of great significance. The quantitative evaluation of the spatio-temporal differences in carbon footprint is practical and essential for developing decarbonization retrofit strategies. 3 Technology framework 3.1 Theoretical framework and algorithm As shown in Fig. 3 , the generation of carbon emissions from living space must meet two necessary conditions. One is that the space is occupied by users, and the other is that some living indicators, such as luminance and temperature, cannot meet comfort requirements, resulting in the application of relevant energy-consuming regulation equipment. In terms of the emissions measurement, the usage time values could reflect the presence of occupants, and the indicator adjustment range and equipment efficiency are the two main variables that determine the energy consumed to regulate the undesirable nature conditions. Correspondingly, the monitoring of user position, indoor physical environment, occupants living habits, and equipment unit consumption could help obtain the values of the said measurement elements, which is also the research core of this paper. In order to cope with the multiple difficulties of CEM in the operation phase of historic residences, and to deeply analyze the sources of carbon footprint, this paper proposes a divide-and-conquer CO2 emissions accounting method based on dynamic monitoring. By dividing dwellings into several separate spaces, the total released amount is calculated by summing of measured values of the CO2 emissions from each space. After subtracting the net CO2 removal by sinks, the actual carbon emission in the operation phase is obtained. The formula is entered as follows (Zhang et al., 2023a). (1) C = ∑ i = 1 n C i − C p where Ci represents the carbon emissions of Space i, while Cp is the reduction amount from the carbon sinks in that period. In terms of the measurement of Ci , considering most historic dwellings have no elevators, the activities that generate a carbon footprint are composed of HVAC (Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning), lighting, cooking, and water heating (Fan et al., 2013). Based on the said ECM theory, the CO2 emissions are calculated by the energy consumption and the carbon EF of that energy (shown as Eq. (2)). Nevertheless, if some activities are powered by renewable energy systems, the energy consumption generated by them should not be counted in. (2) C i = ∑ j = 1 m T i , j × W i , j × E F i , j where Ci is the total carbon emissions of space i. Ti,j is the duration of activity j in space i. Wi,j is the consumption per unit time for this activity, and EFi,j stands for the carbon emission factor of the relevant energy. In terms of the calculation of CO2 removal by sinks, after clarifying the various plant species through field investigation, the carbon sequestration capacity (CP ) is estimated by Eq. (3). (3) C p = ∑ l = 1 w f l × A l × t where Cp is the total carbon reduction amount from the carbon sinks. fl is the annual carbon reduction per unit area of plant l, Al is its planting area, and t is the accounting time. The aforementioned algorithms can be integrated to realize the carbon emission analysis of the residential operation stage by Eq. (4). (4) C = ∑ i = 1 n [ ∑ j = 1 m ( T i , j × W i , j × E F i , j ) ] − ( ∑ l = 1 w f l × A l × t ) In order to assign accurate values to the variables in this algorithm, time-series monitoring and simulation are adopted for a variety of parameters by integrating multiple digital technologies. The corresponding algorithm is also written into the code of the built intelligent platform. After the coupling of multi-source data on the platform, the dynamic visualized assessment of carbon emissions of historic residences is realized based on the following technology roadmap. 3.2 Technology roadmap Based on the proposed carbon emission calculation algorithm, this paper introduces a technology roadmap to assign values of variables in Eq. (4) based on monitoring and investigation, which contains six steps (Fig. 4 ). 3.2.1 Digital twin management platform construction (Step 1) Step 1 is the foundation of the whole evaluation system. The concept of digital twin (information mirror model), is first introduced by Professor Grieves (Grieves, 2011), which refers to the creation and simulation of a physical entity, process, or system within an information platform. Based on digital twin technology, the state of the physical entity can be available on the information platform. Digital simulations would be established within the platform by integrating physical data, artificial intelligence, and software analysis. Ideally, digital twin models are capable of providing real-time feedback to the environmental changes of the physical entities automatically. Considering the heritage conservation requirements of historic buildings, the application of digital twin technology is able to achieve residential management with less physical intervention. Moreover, by integrating multi-source data into one platform, efficient simulation for carbon emission measurement could be generated so that the intelligent platform is fundamental to ensuring the whole evaluation system operating. The technical process of this step consists of four modules with six layers (Fig. 5 ). Our previous study (Qian & Leng, 2021) has described the detailed technology roadmap for building the intelligent management platform for historic dwellings. First is the spatial module. Historic dwellings normally lack architectural drawings and have been self-organized by occupants for a long time. In order to effectively account for spatial scales and to master the location of equipment and pipelines, comprehensive model mapping is necessary. Considering obligatory architectural heritage preservation requirements, as well as mapping efficiency and accuracy, digital technologies such as oblique photography, three-dimensional (3D) laser scanning, and remote sensing are highly recommended at this layer. The related digital twin model, Building Information Modeling (BIM), should be built at this layer, while the carbon sink area (Al ) can be measured simultaneously. In the partitioning layer, the indoor space can be classified on the built digital model by identifying the spatial functions through field investigation with the support of cluster analysis and spatial interpolation (Xu et al., 2020). The monitoring module is composed of the acquisition layer and storage layer. Based on IoT technology, various devices, such as sensors and beacons, are applied to capture multi-source data in the acquisition layer. Afterward, the massive time-series data are dynamically transmitted and stored through cloud computing and big data technologies in the storage layer. In terms of database selection, the Structured Query Language (SQL) database is more suitable for storing static information such as sensor IDs, while time-series data could be effectively stored by Not only SQL (NoSQL) database. The processing module is responsible for data analysis. Due to some interference factors such as user behavior and electromagnetic signals, the collected dataset may exist unreasonable error data. Scientific data cleaning and noise reduction can improve the accuracy of carbon emission accounting. Multiple theories and methodologies have been introduced to analyze time-series monitoring data by adopting different statistical algorithms (Vanus et al., 2019; Naghizadeh et al., 2019). Regarding the last display modular, with the release of HTML5, the WebGL2 application programming interface (API) launched in 2017 provides good feasibility for web-based interactive 3D rendering. By integrating the BIM models with Industry Foundation Class (IFC) standard, these geometric data can be translated and uploaded to BIMServer through plug-ins such as IFCOpenshell. After parsing the IFC files into lightweight triangular grid data, the model data and dynamic time series data would be coupled with unified API interfaces, and dynamic measurement results could be graphically displayed on the web-based platform. Our previous work (Qian & Leng, 2021) has detailed introduced the limitations and difficulties in the process of platform construction. Generally, most limitations are brought by the characteristics of historic dwellings, such as the accuracy of point cloud model, the interference of user behaviors on data acquisition, and the heritage conservation requirements when installing IoT devices. Moreover, relevant talents and fundings are also potential challenges that cannot be ignored. 3.2.2 Living habits assessment (Step 2) Considering the differences in the lifestyles of the occupants in historic residences, Step 2 aims to assess the occupant comfort requirements including thermal, light, rest time, bathing, and cooking habits. The occupant's thermal comfort ranges directly determine the energy consumption of heating and cooling activities whereas multiple researchers have proven the different thermal perceptions of occupants living in historic dwellings (Martinez-Molina et al., 2016; Qian et al., 2023). Fortunately, current research has established a mature system for indoor thermal comfort assessment. The PMV-PPD indices developed by Fanger (Fanger, 1970) are suitable for evaluating buildings with HVAC systems while the regression-based adaptive thermal comfort model (Nicol & Humphreys, 1973) could well explain the thermal environment of naturally ventilated buildings (Yao et al., 2022). In terms of evaluation temperature calculation, the operative temperature (top) (Shao & Jin, 2020), which comprehensively considers air temperature and mean radiant temperature, is capable of reflecting the thermal environment. By combining the top with investigated thermal sensation votes (TSV), the neutral temperature, as well as the 80 % acceptable interval are available based on the ASHRAE 55 Standard (Zhang et al., 2018). When the actual measured operative temperature is not within the 80 % interval, it is considered that thermal conditioning equipment is required, so that the corresponding energy consumption and carbon footprint can be clarified. In terms of the evaluation of other lifestyles, in addition to field investigations, monitoring equipment are also applied to help conduct quantitative research. For instance, illumination sensors can help evaluate lighting habits and occupants\u2019 rest time. It is worth mentioning that there is no lighting energy consumption during rest time even if that period's illumination is not within the acceptable range. In terms of the limitations of this step, the evaluation of occupants' lifestyles is normally conducted on a whole community since single-building samples are limited. Therefore, the real habits of the residents in one particular residence may differ somewhat from the assessment results. 3.2.3 Indoor environment prediction (Step 3) After completing the comfort demand assessment, the spatio-temporal distribution of undesirable nature conditions is derived through the prediction of each spatial environment in Step 3. Due to low intervention requirements and financial constraints, only a few monitoring equipment are allowed to install in historic dwellings. Thus, the core is to simulate and predict multiple dynamic and non-uniformly distributed environmental parameters based on limited monitoring points. Currently, open-source software for environmental numerical simulation such as OpenFOAM has been widely applied and recognized (Heidarinejad et al., 2016; Lan et al., 2021). Relevant indoor environmental databases could be built based on the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations on multiple. In order to reduce the computational volume of time-series data and improve the simulation efficiency, the data processing method of dimensionality reduction and discretization is highly recommended to obtain low-dimensional linear databases (Ren & Cao, 2019). Machine learning can be carried on the massive discrete data obtained from the simulation according to suitable artificial intelligence algorithms. By placing the limited monitoring data as an input layer, the entire indoor environmental distribution can be achieved based on this fast prediction model. 3.2.4 Occupant locating (Step 4) The relevant carbon footprint is only generated when the uncomfortable space is occupied. Therefore, by integrating occupant positioning information with Step 2 and 3, the spatial and temporal distributions of carbon footprint would be clarified. With the rapid development of people locating technology and related location-based services (LBS), a number of theories for indoor positioning technology have been put forward, such as the nearest neighbor methods (Bahl & Padmanabhan, 2000), trilateration methods (Pakanon et al., 2020), and fingerprint database (Zhang et al., 2019). Compared with the complex indoor conditions in public buildings, the interior space of historic residences has less signal interference as well as no guarantee of WIFI coverage. Thereby, deploying Bluetooth low energy (BLE) beacons in different clustering spaces should be the most economical and feasible method to locate occupants. With the popularization of smartphones, real-time positioning can be realized by collecting Bluetooth signals from cell phones. Specifically, the built-in accelerometer is used for pace detection and pedometry while the gyroscope and magnetometer are responsible for orientation determination. Through the adoption of a suitable positioning algorithm, this smartphone-based positioning method enables long-term real-time monitoring of occupants\u2019 locations with high positioning accuracy, low energy consumption, and low intervention (Li et al., 2017). However, occupants may not carry their phones all the time in their properties, which will inevitably affect positioning accuracy. But if conditions allow, users can be equipped with smart bracelets to compensate for this limitation. 3.2.5 Equipment energy consumption estimation (Step 5) Only clarifying the distribution of the carbon footprints is far from enough, in order to realize accurate accounting, scientific unit energy consumption evaluation of the relevant equipment is essential. Due to the outdated construction methods and various environmental regulation modes, the conditioning equipment energy consumption estimations in historic dwellings are comparatively difficult. For instance, there are multiple heating methods for historical Chinese traditional dwellings such as burning coal, electric heater, and Chinese Kang (Zheng & Bu, 2018) while the accounting route of each method varies. This research adopts the control variates method to measure the energy consumption per unit. Turning on the target equipment with the rest of the equipment running in the same state, energy consumption sensors and field measurements are applied to measure the change of energy consumed per unit of time, and the estimation results should be obtained by taking the average value through multiple experiments. Concerning the HVAC system, the energy estimation of temperature regulation and maintenance should be calculated separately. Finally, the equipment information and relevant energy consumption would be stored into the BIM model to achieve the integration with other multi-source data in the platform. Seasonal variations in equipment energy consumption and the power differences of the same type of equipment are overlooked, which can be seen as a limitation in this step. 3.2.6 Integration and accounting (Step 6) Referring to Fig. 4, the evaluation of living habits (Step 2) and each space environment (Step 3) make it possible to clarify the spatial and temporal distributions that need to be regulated by energy-consuming equipment. With the supplement of the monitoring of occupant locating (Step 4), the number of activities that generate carbon footprint in each space, as well as their duration, can be determined, which means the value of the variable Ti,j in Eq. (4) can be assigned. The variable Wi,j is obtained through Step 5 while the values of EFi,j and fl in Eq. (4) are assigned by referring to relevant official documents and research. Lastly, the carbon sink area Al is measured in Step 1, and the measurement period t is determined by the needs of managers. Thus, based on this technology roadmap, all of the variables in Eq. (4) are assigned so that the carbon emissions (C) in the operational phase of historic residences can be calculated and evaluated based on the built intelligent management platform. 4 Case study of historic building in Nanping city, China For a better understanding of the aforementioned technology roadmap, this section introduces the workflow of each step in detail with specific practice in a historic traditional dwelling in northern Fujian, China. 4.1 Project introduction Located in Nanping City (E 118.16°-118.36°and N 27.54°-27.75°), the practice site belongs to the hot summer and cold winter climate zone, which means both heating and cooling systems are required. As shown in Fig. 6 , the whole site is linked by an ancient alley called Xingxian, whose history can be traced back to Tang Dynasty (618\u2013907). The case, No. 21 traditional dwelling in Xingxian Village is a typical one-story historic courtyard residence with four units along the east-west direction. Qian et al. (2023). The standard unit contains an inner courtyard surrounded by enclosed rooms and semi-open halls and corridors in three directions while the last unit acts as functional space, including a shared kitchen, storage, and dining room (Fig. 7 ). This traditional dwelling is composed of three families, namely Elder Chen and his granddaughter (Family 1) on the south side, Elder Peng (Family 2), and another single man (Family 3) on the north side. The detailed occupant information is shown in Table 2 . Various parameters of this historic residence have been continuously and dynamically monitored for one year in order to evaluate its operating performance. Compared with other seasons, energy consumption and carbon emissions are much higher in summer because of the extremely hot and humid environment. Thereby, this research chose to measure and evaluate the daily carbon emissions on 14 August 2022 to reveal the differences in the carbon footprint of each space within the project. 4.2 Data acquisition and processing 4.2.1 Management platform construction (Step 1) Based on the said four-module technology framework (Fig. 5), this practice has completed the construction of the intelligent management platform (Qian & Leng, 2021). The multi-source heterogeneous data have been integrated and analyzed to achieve multi-objective evaluation and prediction so that the graphically interactive presentation of the carbon accounting result is realized (Fig. 8 ). Specifically, in the spatial module, the Global Positioning System (GPS) and Remote Sensing (RS) technologies were adopted to conduct a macro-level positioning and environmental assessment of the target residence in conjunction with the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Aerial Survey based on oblique photography technology (Fig. 6). In terms of the indoor space scale and equipment information acquisition, a point cloud model was established to realize the scale mapping based on 3D laser scanning technology, while a Revit-based BIM model recording relevant detailed building information was built accordingly (Fig. 9 ). Combining the c-value clustering analysis algorithm with field investigation, the spatial division of residential houses and monitoring points selection was completed (Fig. 7) (Cao et al., 2020). As to the massive time-series data acquisition, monitored parameters and relevant sensors\u2019 information are shown in Table 3 . It is worth mentioning that the sensors should be highly integrated and fixed by iron hoop in order to reduce the unnecessary damage to the historic dwellings (Fig. 10 ). Alibaba Cloud was applied for data transmission and calculation while InfluxDB (NoSQL) and MySQL (SQL) databases were responsible for the storage of time-series data and static data separately. Afterward, MATLAB and SPSS were adopted to clean the massive measured data and BIMServer was invoked to combine the data with light weighted models on the website. 4.2.2 Living habitat assessment (Step 2) Since this project is a naturally ventilated courtyard traditional dwelling, the adaptive thermal comfort model theory proposed by Professor Humphreys was adopted for the thermal comfort assessment. Our previous research (Qian et al., 2023) has detailed introduced the yearlong thermal comfort investigation conducted in Wufu town. The operative temperature was calculated based on the monitored values of AT, RH, BT, and AV while over 1000 valid TSV questionnaires were obtained from September 2021 to August 2022. Eq. (5) and Eq. (6) present the regression equations for interior and semi-open spaces separately and Fig. 11 shows the investigation results of August 2022. Considering the August monthly average temperature is 29.2 °C, the range of 80 % acceptable indoor temperature is 24.9 °C\u201331.9 °C(interior) and 25.1 °C\u201332.1 °C(semi-open) based on the ASHRAE 55 standard. When the measured temperature exceeds the acceptable interval, relevant air conditioning equipment are considered in use. (5) Interior : t n = 0.6819 t o u t + 8.4585 ( R 2 = 0.9395 ) (6) Semi − open : t n = 0.7391 t o u t + 7.033 ( R 2 = 0.9406 ) where tout is the outdoor mean temperature, and tn is the corresponding indoor neutral temperature. In addition, the occupants\u2019 lighting habits as well as the average daily consumption of hot water and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) were estimated based on the yearlong investigation. The survey shows that most (more than 80 %) local occupants would like to turn on the lights when the illumination is below 120 lux (Fig. 12 ) while approximately 30 L/person hot water and 0.3 kg LPG are consumed daily in the summertime. 4.2.3 Physical environment distribution prediction (Step 3) According to the aforementioned prediction theory based on the simulated database and machine learning algorithms, this practice achieved the goal of entire environmental distribution assessment from limited monitoring data. The classic CFD software OpenFOAM and RBF artificial neural network (ANN) (Ren & Cao, 2020) were applied to train the indoor environment data, such as the temperature and velocity fields (Fig. 13 ). The low-dimensional discretization process of the simulated data could remarkably reduce the computing volume so that the environmental parameters\u2019 databases of each divided space would be created efficiently. Then, the algorithm was trained in the hidden layer of the neural network based on the simulated data to build a fast prediction model. Finally, the measured time-series data were invoked as an input layer to realize the prediction of real-time physical environmental distribution. 4.2.4 Occupant spatial locating (Step 4) Considering the low-intervention requirement, as well as the poor coverage of the WIFI signal, this practice applied Bluetooth beacon positioning technology because of its low power and cost properties. Based on the propagation model positioning theory, the distance information can be translated according to the strength of surround signals. Therefore, through the signal transmission between the users\u2019 smartphones and Bluetooth beacons, the real-time location can be predicted to the building plan with clear clustering boundaries (Fig. 14 ). Specifically, Bluetooth beacons were installed in each of the 26 clustered spaces (Fig. 15 (a)), and then the Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR) algorithm is applied to build a 3D motion model of the actual walking pattern of pedestrians. In order to improve the locating accuracy, this case adopted a particle filtering (PF) optimization algorithm (Junoh et al., 2021) to help fuse the plane map and PDR information. More than 1000 signal acquisitions were performed in different positions of each space (Fig. 15(b)) to help refine the PF-based PDR positioning algorithm in this case. Practice proved that the locating error is less than 1.5 m and the spatial identification error is less than 10 %. 4.2.5 Equipment energy consumption estimation (Step 5) In order to preserve historic dwellings, HVAC systems are not widely used in traditional villages. In addition, considering the remarkable thermal environmental performance of this kind of naturally-ventilated courtyard dwelling, the application of electric fans can mostly meet the cooling needs of residents (Qian et al., 2023). As the low-carbon demonstration village, the heating radiator powered by biomass is widely promoted to solve the heating problem. Moreover, due to the poor infrastructure, occupants have to go to the public toilet at the entrance of the village, while the washroom inside the dwelling is only used for bathing. The representative energy-consuming equipment in this project is shown in Fig. 16 . Based on the BIM model built in Step 1, the electricity network could be clarified. Afterward, the energy consumption differences between turning on and off target equipment were counted individually through the energy consumption sensors (Fig. 10(a)). The mean unit energy consumption of different equipment was obtained through over twenty experiments each. The practice shows that the gear adjustment of the residential ceiling fan has little effect on its energy consumption, which can be ignored in the estimation. Lastly, the carbon emission factors of different energy sources are clarified in Table 4 by referring to relevant literature (MOHURD, 2019). 4.2.6 Carbon emissions measurement of the sample Based on the multi-source data monitoring and processing, carbon emission measurements of each space in the demonstration historic residence can be realized through this technology roadmap. Taking Space C08 (the bedroom of User II) as an example (Fig. 7), Table 5 presents the relevant predicted physical environmental data through the simulation in Step 3 and the user locating information on that day. The values of operative temperature (top ) were obtained through the monitoring of AT, BT, and AV while the 80 % acceptable temperature of interior space is 24.9 °C-31.9 °C, which means the periods which measured top over 31.9 °C should be intervened. In terms of the user locating information, the value \u201c0\u2033 means there are no users in that space while values \u201c1\u2033 and \u201c2\u2033 indicate that the user (or users) is awake and asleep, respectively. In order to harmonize the continuous location monitoring with the frequency of environmental data (30-minute step), only if the users stay in that space for more than 30 min, it will be marked as \u201c1\u2033 at the nearest time point. Considering users normally are not willing to turn on any energy-consuming equipment for short stays, space occupation of fewer than 30 min will be ignored. Therefore, all predicted environmental parameters that did not meet the comfort requirements of the occupants are highlighted with different color borders in Table 5. Furthermore, the red shading is the temperature discomfort periods with uses occupied while the blue shading represents the poor illumination periods with active users. In that case, Space C08 required 11.5 h of cooling and 4 h of lighting on 14 August 2022. The carbon emissions are calculated below: C c 08 = ( 0.1 × 11.5 + 0.05 × 4 ) × 0.7035 = 0.9497 Similarly, estimated carbon emissions for each space can be generated by this platform's built-in algorithm (Fig. 17 ). Considering there are 4 m2 potted plants in the narrow courtyard of this dwelling, which could neutralize approximately 0.2192 kg of carbon every day. The total carbon emission of this historic traditional dwelling is 9.2203 kg on 14 August 2022. 4.3 Case evaluation Due to the higher space utilization on weekends, as well as the users\u2019 strong demand for cooling in the summertime, the total carbon emission of the case date in this historic residence increased dramatically compared to other days. Among these 26 functional spaces, toilets and shared kitchens had significantly higher carbon emissions than other spaces because of the heavy use of domestic hot water and gas. Nevertheless, the overall carbon emissions of semi-open spaces such as the halls and corridors were only 0.2814 kg (3 % of the total), which makes the carbon performance of the whole dwelling relatively good. In addition to the low usage rate of such spaces at night, the unique building form of a semi-open hall with a narrow patio, which ensures sufficient ventilation and natural lighting, is also another fundamental reason. In terms of the carbon footprint analysis of the interior spaces, the energy consumed for cooling took up approximately six times that used for lighting. Even with the application of electric fans, the carbon footprint from cooling still occupied about 36.6 % in the summertime. The lack of openings leading to poor ventilation and heat exchange capacity may be the main potential cause. Thus, based on this quantitative CEM evaluation system, the targeted strategies for low-carbon retrofit could be developed. Apart from the application of renewable energy for cooking and water heating, it is essential to focus more on thermal environment optimization for high-usage interior spaces, such as Space C08 and B04. Regarding accounting accuracy, authors have conducted continuous follow-up field investigations to record the energy-consuming equipment's actual usage. The results show that the errors between platform estimation and the actual situation are related to the season and the age of the users. Specifically, the errors could be more obvious in summer because of the usage of ceiling fans. Meanwhile, the elderly generally use less energy than estimated while youngsters and children sometimes forget to turn off the conditioning equipment in daily life. However, most of the spatial daily carbon emission accounting errors are less than 20 % under different scenarios, and the accounting results of total daily carbon emissions are quite acceptable within an error of around 15 %. In addition, the authors applied the widely recognized energy simulation software DesignBuilder to compare the daily accounting results. Interestingly, if every parameter related to carbon footprint is manually inserted by the data collected from the platform, the simulation results are not that bad, with an approximately 30 % difference from the actual measured results. However, the results will turn out to be outrageous if the data are not updated in time. Therefore, compared with traditional simulation methods, the biggest advantage of this system is that the input parameter regarding to the carbon emissions accounting can be dynamically updated in the platform to achieve a balance between accounting accuracy and efficiency. 5 Discussion There are a large number of traditional historic dwellings in cities. Considering they have great potential for low-carbon renewal, such as sufficient rooftop resources for photovoltaic power, traditional dwellings are treated as an important resource on the road to carbon neutrality. With suitable retrofits, not only can these residences achieve net-zero or even negative carbon operation themselves, their heritage characters can be better preserved simultaneously. Therefore, carbon emission assessments of these dwellings\u2019 current status appear to be vital in helping identify optimization orientation. However, existing relevant digital simulation research are mostly static, and cannot automatically update the carbon-related input data. Considering the complex operation modes and heritage conservation requirements, there are no existing feasibility methods to realize the accuracy of CEM in historic dwellings with acceptable efficiency based on the comprehensive literature review. This research proposes a digital twin intelligent management platform based on multiple digital technologies. Based on the dynamic monitoring of multi-source data, the technology roadmap for carbon emissions assessment in the operation phase of historic dwellings is constructed to visualize the spatial distribution of accounting results in a low-intervention manner. It is worth mentioning that this evaluation system also has great feasibility and is even easier to promote in other modern residences in cities because of their standardized construction methods and accessible energy consumption information. To sum up, this carbon emissions evaluation technology roadmap has the following achievements. \u2022 By coupling the actual measurement data with computational simulation, a user-friendly intelligent platform is established for historic dwellings to manage historic dwellings, enabling information integration, efficient calculations, and data traceability. \u2022 The proposed technical approach to carbon accounting is practical and feasible for the complex operation situation of historic dwellings. The input carbon-related parameters in the algorithm can be dynamically updated in the platform to guarantee accounting accuracy and efficiency simultaneously. \u2022 A low-intervention route to identify the retrofit priorities through quantitative analysis of spatial-temporal carbon emission differences is proposed to help historic dwellings develop decarbonization strategies. \u2022 The novel digital twin platform can rapidly insert the accounting results into the building plan and display them graphically. However, there are still some limitations and challenges in the practical operation. The whole evaluation system defaults to the occupants turning on the conditioning equipment in any unsatisfactory situations and turning them off immediately when they leave, which is unrealistic. Meanwhile, each step in this system has a certain measurement error. Practice shows that the maximum prediction error of the indoor environmental prediction model is 13 %. Based on Bluetooth beacons and PF-based PDR optimization algorithm, the occupant locating error is mostly less than 2 m. In terms of lifestyle evaluation, some of the research fitting degrees (R2) are lower than 0.8. However, most of the spatial daily carbon emission accounting errors are less than 20 % under different scenarios, and the accounting results of total daily carbon emissions are in an error of around 15 %, which is capable of meeting the accuracy requirements of the practical engineering application. In addition, there is also a certain number of challenges in manpower, material, and financial resources. With the development of relevant digital technologies and the cultivation of interdisciplinary talents, the evaluation cost will be significantly reduced in the near future. 6 Conclusion The dominant objective of this work is to accurately measure the carbon emissions of historic residences at different times of the year based on an intelligent digital twin platform. Meanwhile, in order to explore the potential decarbonization retrofit strategies, the spatio-temporal distribution of the carbon footprint is tried to be clarified so that only carbon-intensive spaces would be focused on without intervening in others. By comprehensively analyzing the accounting challenges and the limitations of existing carbon emission calculation theories, this research proposes a systematic carbon emission measurement technology roadmap for the operation phase of historic dwellings based on an intelligent management platform, which can reduce the intervention on these architectural heritages, but guarantee the efficiency and accuracy simultaneously. The paper first introduces the technology roadmap for building an intelligent maintenance and management platform for historic dwellings based on multiple digital technologies such as BIM, IoT, and Big Data. Afterward, multi-source physical environmental parameters are dynamically monitored to help predict the indoor microenvironment distribution and evaluate the occupants\u2019 living habits in order to clarify the spatio-temporal distribution of the undesirable nature conditions. With the help of the BLE-based occupant locating system, the occurrence of energy-consuming activities could be determined correspondingly. Through the unit energy consumption measurements of different equipment in the energy monitoring modular, the carbon emissions of each activity could be calculated based on the ECM theory and relevant carbon emission factor library. Lastly, based on the fusion of multi-source heterogeneous data and computational simulation, the carbon emission evaluation results of the historic dwellings in the operation phase can be graphically displayed on the intelligent management platform, which has characteristics of interactive and intuitive. The case study in China proved the outstanding performance of the accuracy of accounting results, with an approximate daily spatial error of 20 % and a total accounting error of less than 15 %. This research fills a research gap in accounting for the spatio-temporal distribution of carbon emissions from existing residences with complex operation modes with certain accuracy and efficiency. Considering a comprehensive database is constructed through the platform, machine learning can be applied to explore the relationship between the carbon emissions of residential buildings and some indicators, such as outdoor weather. Thereby, future carbon emissions should be predictable in further studies so that the risk of tripping due to excessive load might be avoided in old dwellings. Meanwhile, this proposed carbon accounting system can highlight the spatial carbon footprint differences and sources. Thus, data-driven optimization strategies as well as the intelligent control system can be applied for energy-efficiency space development in the future. In the context of architectural heritage conservation and carbon-neutral development, this research is of great significance in providing quantitative references for historical residences\u2019 decarbonization retrofit.

        "dc:description": "Historic dwellings in cities are considered to be an important resource on the way to carbon neutrality because of their great potential for low-carbon renewal. However, in addition to obligatory heritage conservation requirements, there is no uniformity in historic dwellings\u2019 operation mode and conditioning equipment, which means detailed carbon emissions accounting is critical but challenging. To estimate the spatio-temporal distribution of carbon emissions from historic dwellings and thus support the development of decarbonization retrofit strategies, this research proposed a low-interventional carbon footprint accounting system based on a digital twin management platform. Multiple digital technologies are applied to monitor and evaluate the occupants\u2019 lifestyles, indoor environment, user location, and equipment energy consumption. Based on backend algorithms, the spatio-temporal distribution of carbon emissions is inserted into the building plan to graphically present the evaluation results. Compared with traditional simulation methods, the proposed system enables the automatic updating of energy accounting parameters by fusing multi-source data into one platform, improving accounting efficiency and accuracy simultaneously. A case study in China proves the outstanding performance of the accuracy of accounting results, with an approximate daily spatial error of 20 % and a total accounting error of less than 15 %.",
