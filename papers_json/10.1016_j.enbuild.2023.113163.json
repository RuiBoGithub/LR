Variable Refrigerant Flow (VRF) systems are gradually gaining popularity in small and medium-sized commercial and residential buildings owing to their high part-load performance, flexible control, and ease of installation and maintenance. Developing models of VRF systems to predict their performance are important for model-based control, fault diagnostic and detection. There are VRF models published in existing literatures, however those models were developed and validated in different datasets. As a result, the model accuracy cannot be directly compared. To fill this gap, this paper presents a comprehensive review of the existing VRF models, and summarizes the input/output parameters and mathematical formulas of 16 VRF models from literature (referred to as physics-based model). Next, we validate and compare the model accuracy of existing models using the same dataset. Additionally, we develop data-driven models using the state-of-art machine learning algorithms, and compare the model accuracy between existing physics-based models with data-driven models. We find the model proposed by Hu et al. in 2019, which regresses the VRF cooling capacity and COP as a linear combination of indoor and outdoor temperatures times a cubed polynomial function of compressor frequency, is the most accurate physics-based model, with a prediction error of 22.19% in the training dataset and 22.44% in the validation dataset. XGBoost is the most accurate data-driven model, with a prediction error of 19.29% in the training dataset and 22.02% in the validation dataset. The data-driven model is more accurate while the physics-based model is more generalizable. The findings of this study can help researchers to select the proper VRF model for building energy prediction, model-based optimization, and fault diagnostic and detection.

In addition, a comfortable indoor environment is important as most people spend more than 90% of their time indoors [2]. Meanwhile, existing energy surveys found that the building sector accounts for more than 40% of the total energy consumption in the United States [3], and Europe [4]. With the economic development and urbanization in developing countries such as India, the building energy consumption is expected to further increase [5]. Therefore, improving HVAC energy efficiency is critical for sustainable development and to address climate change. Variable Refrigerant Flow (VRF) systems are gradually gaining popularity in small and medium-sized commercial and residential buildings owing to their high part-load performance, flexible control, and ease of installation and maintenance. As a HVAC system type different than water-based or air-based system, understanding its performance characteristics is crucial for applications such as building energy simulation, model-based control, and fault diagnostic and detection. 1.1 Variable refrigerant flow system The variable refrigerant flow (VRF) or variable refrigerant volume (VRV) system is a type of centralized air conditioning system that was originally introduced over 40 years ago [6]. The VRF system is constituted by one exterior unit and multiple indoor units, as shown in Fig. 1 . The exterior and indoor units are connected by a refrigerant pipe loop together with electronic expansion valves (EEVs), matching system and zone controllers [7]. The VRF system regulates the refrigerant flow rate to the numerous indoor units by EEVs to provide space cooling or heating needed by each thermal zones. As a contrary, the water-based and air-based HVAC system regulates the chilled or heated water (supply water temperature and flow rate) and air (supply air temperature and flow rate) for indoor thermal environment control. [8]. One advantage of the VRF system is its high-performance during part load operation. Additionally, the VRF system is easy and cheap to be installed because it does not require ducting installation as water- or air-based system [9,10]. Because of those benefits, the VRF system has been increasingly deployed in small and medium-sized commercial and residential buildings. Existing study has demonstrated that the VRF system can work with on-site renewable generation such as photovoltaic panels (PV) in carbon neutral buildings [11]. 1.2 Modeling VRF With the wide application of the VRF system in buildings, it becomes increasingly important to model VRF systems, because modeling is a key step for applications such as building energy simulation, model-based control, and fault diagnostic and detection. Additionally, the VRF system is difficult to be modeled due to the nonlinearity between inputs and outputs [12]. The approaches to model VRF systems can be generally classified into black-box data-driven models and white-box physics-based models. Black-box data-driven models are developed by measuring the necessary inputs (indoor temperature, outdoor temperature, compressor frequency, etc.) and outputs (cooling output, electricity consumption, COP, etc.) of the system and then developing a regression model to predict the outputs from inputs. With the development of machine learning and increasing availability of the VRF operation data, the modeling accuracy of data-driven approach is increasing. Another advantage of data-driven approach is the modeling process is standardized and simple, thanks to the prosperity of open-sourced machine learning libraries. However, data-driven approach is limited by its generalizability. Therefore, it requires a large and diversified dataset that ideally covers the entire input\u2013output space. Additionally, the lack of physical meaning makes people hesitate about its performance. White-box physics-based models are developed on the physical principles. A purely physics-based models require detailed information about the system such as the heat transfer area and coefficient of the exterior and indoor unit, and solving the coupled equations of heat transfer, thermal-dynamics, fluid flow, etc. For VRF system modeling, the detailed system information is difficult to retrieve, and solving the coupled equations is challenging. As a result, a hybrid-approach is mode widely used, which relies on physical principles to deduce the architecture of the model, while the values of the model parameters come from regressing the model on operational data. In this way, the detailed information is not needed, as the model parameters do not come directly from the parameters such as heat transfer area and coefficient of the exterior and indoor unit. Because the physical principle is generalizable, therefore physics-based model is expected to generalize better to unseen datasets. The hybrid approach is widely adopted in tools such as EnergyPlus, Modelica, and TRNSYS to develop VRF system models [13]. To avoid confusion, the hybrid approach will be referred to as physics-based approach in this paper. 1.3 Objectives and contributions With the wide application of VRF systems in buildings, modeling VRF through white-box physics-based models and black-box data-driven has attracted increasing research attentions. Different VRF models have been proposed and developed. However, the comparison of those models is challenging, because different models are developed on different datasets, and they all claimed their models perform the best. As a result, researchers and practitioners still have no ideas which model should be used. To address this research gap, we plan to conduct a compressive literature review on existing VRF models, and then evaluate and compare their accuracy using one real-world dataset. The findings of this study can help researchers to select the proper VRF model for building energy prediction, model-based optimization, and fault diagnostic and detection. The objectives of this study are as follows. First, we aim to conduct a comprehensive review of existing VRF models from literature, summarizing them in one table, comparing the selection of input variables, and model expressions (Section 2). Next, we will compare different VRF models, including physics-based and data-driven models using one real-world dataset covering one whole cooling season in an office building (Section 3). Third, we will use the best performing models to analyze how the energy efficiency of VRF will be influenced by input variables (Section 4). 2 Models from literature review 2.1 Method The major goal of this review aims to provide a brief summary of the existing literatures on the VRF system models. This review will follow the concept-centric principle proposed by Webster and Watson [14] and benefit from related literature reviews on building system energy models [15,16]. This literature review is conducted on four online databases: Web of Science™ Core Collection \u2013 Citation Indexes (SCI-EXPANDED & SSCI), the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), Scopus, and Google Scholar, with the document type limited to peer-reviewed research articles and review papers. The literature search was conducted on May of 2022, using the keyword combinations of \u201cvariable refrigerant flow or VRF\u201d, \u201cvariable refrigerant flow performance or VRF performance\u201d, and \u201cvariable refrigerant flow model or VRF model\u201d. The primary focus of this review is model development for VRF systems: including the selected input features and output variables, and the mathematical expressions that map the inputs to the outputs. 2.2 Results With the literature search method mentioned above, 16 VRF system models are found and summarized in Table 1 and Table 2 . The model inputs include ambient boundary conditions (such as outdoor temperature, indoor temperature, etc.), or operational conditions (such as evaporating temperature, condensing temperature, compressor speed, fan speed, etc.). The model is developed and validated using operational data, or experiment data provided by the manufactures. We identified ten model inputs in the sixteen reviewed models, including indoor wet-bulb temperature, outdoor dry-bulb temperature, evaporation temperature, condensing temperature, compressor frequency, fan speed or air/water flow rate at the condensing side, refrigerant volume flow rate, part load ratio, specific enthalpy at the suction and discharge side, refrigerant pressure at the suction and discharge side. Among the ten input features, compressor frequency is the most widely used inputs, followed by the condensing temperature. The least used input is the specific enthalpy at the suction and discharge side of the compressor. Some input variables are easier to measure than the others, such as the indoor temperature is easier to measure than the evaporation temperature. Some input features are very difficult to be measured and hard to be measured accurately, such as the refrigerant volume flow rate. The accessibility of the input features restricts the application of those models. It is worth noting that for the indoor temperature, the wet-bulb temperature is selected as the input because the dehumidification usually happens at the indoor units; while for the outdoor temperature, the dry-bulb temperature is selected as the input because air cooling is more widely used for VRF systems than the cooling tower. As for the model output, all reviewed models predict power consumption; while 4 models select cooling or heating capacity as an output, and 3 models select COP or EIR as the power output. In terms of the model architecture, polynomial function is the most widely used. The highest model order is cubic, as in Torregrosa-Jaime et al. [17], Guo et al. [18], and Cai and Braun [19]. The most complicated model is Guo et al. [18], which has 20 parameters to be fitted; while the least complicated model is Kim et al [20], which regresses the electricity power as a linear combination of compressor frequency, condensing temperature and evaporative temperature, with 4 parameters to be fitted. 3 Model development using a real VRF dataset In this section, we will develop and compare physics-based and data-driven models. We first validate the accuracy of the physics-based model summarized in Table 2. The three models with the highest accuracy will be shortlisted, and their inputs will be selected as features for the data-driven models. Three state-of-art machine learning algorithms: Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm, and the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) were selected to develop data-driven models. 3.1 Dataset A real-world operational dataset from a VRF system serving an office building in Foshan, China, is used in this research. The dataset is collected from sensors and smart meters manufactured by three vendors. Midea Building Technology Institute (MBTI) 2 2 https://btri.midea.com/. deployed weather stations and sensors inside the air conditioning units to obtain outdoor environment and VRF system operation data. YADA 3 3 https://www.yada.com.cn/. deployed meters in the building to record the energy consumption of air conditioning systems, lighting, and other equipment. Criiot technology 4 4 https://www.criiot.com/en/. deployed temperature sensors in various building rooms to monitor the indoor environment. A comprehensive depiction of the dataset's structure and its delivery mechanisms across diverse platforms is illustrated in detail in Fig. 2 . The studied VRF system has a single outdoor unit and seven indoor units. The corresponding dataset covers all the input parameters listed in Table 1, except for the specific enthalpy at the suction and discharge sides of compressor, and the compressor displacement volume. It is worth mentioning that the cooling capacity is calculated and provided by the VRF manufacture. Since the discharge and suction specific enthalpy, and the compressor displacement volume are not available in the dataset, the models proposed by Li (2013) [23] and Winandy et al. (2010) [25] will not be validated in the following sections of this paper. Table 3 presents an overview of the dataset, and Table 4 lists the information about the equipment and sensors. More detailed information can be obtained by accessing the official website of vendor. 3.2 Data pre-processing We time-aligned all sensor measurements with electric meter recordings. The energy consumption data from the electric meter was differentiated to obtain power data. The rows with missing data will be dropped. Before we validate the models, we first remove the data points when the VRF is turned off. We also exclude the data points measured at the first 15 min when the VRF has been just turned on. Next, we detected outliers by calculating the VRF system COP. We removed the data points using the 3 σ -principle, i.e., whose calculated COP is deviated more than 3 standard deviations from the mean COP during the cooling season. The remaining data points have a COP range of [1.091, 6.103]. We plot the COP histogram after removing the outliers in Fig. 3 . Some existing models use indoor temperature as a model input. Since VRF systems usually have multiple indoor units, we proposed Algorithm 1 to calculate the mean indoor temperature (SeeFig. 4 ). The key idea is we use the opening state of the evaporation valve (EXV in Algorithm 1) of each indoor unit to determine whether this indoor unit is working or not, and then we average the indoor temperature associated with those indoor units that are working. The studied VRF system has two compressors. However, the reviewed VRF models only address the case of single compressor. Therefore, to validate the model, we use those data points when only one compressor is working, which is 65.6% of dataset. The data pre-processing leaves 430 entries for model validation and comparison, which is equivalent to 107.5 h of operation, as the sampling rate is 15 min. 3.3 Performance evaluation Since almost all reviewed models predict the VRF electric power, as shown in Table 2, we select the VRF electric power as the model output. The ground truth label is obtained by differentiating the VRF energy consumption data recorded by the electricity meter. The evaluation metric selected in this study were based on the ASHRAE Guideline 14 [33]. The coefficient of variance of the root mean square error (CV-RMSE) was used to evaluate the performance of the models. The formula is shown in Eq. (1). (1) CV - R M S E = ∑ i = 1 n Y i - Y ^ i n / ∑ i = 1 n Y i n × 100 % where n represents the same size. Y i is the measured value (i.e., VRF electric power), while Y ^ i is the predicted value. A 5-fold Cross-Validation has been used in this study, as summarized in Table 5 . We randomly divide the whole dataset into five batches, each contains 20% of the total dataset. We use four batches for training (80% of total dataset) and the remaining batch for testing (20% of the total dataset). The testing batch will be hidden in the training stage. Both the training accuracy and testing accuracy will be reported. We will repeat this process for 100 times to reach a more robust estimation about the model accuracy. And we rank the models based on the median of the CV-RMSE of the 100 experiments conducted on the test set. Version 0.23.2 of scikit-learn library in Python was used to implement the 5-fold Cross-Validation [34]. 3.4 Physics-based model We utilize the SciPy library in Python for the physics-based model, which provides the curve_fit function. This function allows for customization of the model with its parameters and can fit the model by the data. We encountered several uncertain or measured values during the fitting process, such as compressor speed, rated operating cooling capacity, and maximum cooling capacity. To address this, we proposed a targeted solution for each parameter, which are detailed in Table 6 . SciPy failed to regress the model proposed by Cai and Braun (2018) [19], probably due to the large number of parameters that need to be fitted. Hence, we did not include this model in the subsequent sections of our analysis. To benchmark the accuracy of advanced models, we developed a simple model as a reference, as shown in Eq. (2). This model uses a constant COP to calculate the VRF electric power. In this study, the COP is selected as the mean value of all valid data-points after the data pre-processing as described in Section 3.2, which equals to 3.6 on our dataset. (2) W = Q cool COP As we run the 5-fold cross-validation for 100 times, the CV-RMSE of each experiment will be slightly different. To facilitate a comprehensive comparison of the prediction accuracy of the above physics-based models, we plotted the box plots of CV-RMSE of all models on both the training and test dataset, as illustrated in Fig. 5 . Nine models exhibited superior performance as compared to the baseline; while 4 models are less accurate than the baseline. The model proposed by Hu et al. [31] is found to be the most accurate on our real-world dataset, with CV-RMSE 6.51% and 6.4% lower on the training and test sets relative to the baseline model. In contrast, the model suggested by Li et al. [22] has a 15% higher CV-RMSE than the simple baseline. We also observe a consistent ranking on the training and testing dataset, except for the model developed by Guo et al. [18]. Guo et al. [18]\u2019s model is very accurate on the training dataset but less accurate on the test dataset, demonstrating a clear overfitting issue. When comparing different models, the accuracy on the testing dataset is more important than the accuracy on training dataset [35]. Therefore, we selected the best performing models based on their accuracy on the testing dataset. The models proposed by Hu et al. [31], Li et al. [26], and Cheung and Braun [28] have the smallest prediction error on the testing dataset, with the median CV-RMSEs of 22.44%, 22.53%, and 23.23%, respectively. The features of these three models, as listed in Table 7 , are selected as the features for the data-driven models. 3.5 Purely data-driven model In this section, we will develop purely data-driven models for VRF system and compare their accuracy with physics-based models reviewed previously. To facilitate a fair comparison, the input features of data-driven models are the same as those of physics-based models, as listed in Table 7. The only difference is we use indoor dry-bulb temperature rather than the wet-bulb temperature, because the humidity information is not available in the dataset. We selected three state-of-art machine learning algorithms to develop the data-driven model: Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm, and the Artificial Neural Network (ANN), which represent three distinct paradigms of machine learning algorithms: the kernel function-based classical machine learning, the decision tree-based ensemble learning, and the artificial neural network-based deep learning. Support Vector Machine (SVM) [36] : SVM is a supervised machine learning algorithm that finds the hyperplane in a high-dimensional feature space that maximizes the margin between samples for the purpose of regression analysis. We utilized the Support Vector Regression (SVR) algorithm available in the widely used Scikit-learn library (version 0.23.2) for implementation. During the training phase, three hyper-parameters were selected for fine-tuning, with the corresponding parameter intervals and outcomes presented in Table A1 . eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) [37] : XGBoost is a supervised machine learning algorithm based on an ensemble of boosted tree models, which combines multiple weak predictors to establish a more powerful regression model. The XGBoost (version 1.6.2) library was utilized for algorithm implementation, and a total of nine hyper-parameters were selected for fine-tuning during the training phase. Since the model complexity was not expected to be too high considering the few features employed in this study, the minimum value of maximum tree depth was set to 1. Details regarding the selected parameter intervals and the corresponding outcomes are presented in Table A2 . Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) [38] : ANN is a supervised machine learning algorithm that utilizes artificial neural networks to establish a more powerful regression model by combining multiple layers of neurons. The Keras (version 2.10.0) library was employed to construct the ANN model, and during the training phase, two hyper-parameters, namely the number of layers and the number of neurons per layer, were selected for fine-tuning. The corresponding parameter intervals and outcomes are presented in Table A3 . The performance of machine learning algorithms highly depends on the hyper-parameter tuning. In this study, we used Bayesian optimization to tune the hyper-parameters, which was implemented by Optuna version 3.1.0 [39,40]. For the hyper-parameter tuning, we further divide the four training batches into training data (80% of the four batches, i.e., 64% of the total data), and validation data (20% of the four batches, i.e., 16% of the total data). The validation data was used to tune the hyper-parameters. To ensure transparency and reproducibility, we summarized the detailed range and selected value of each parameter in Tables A1, A2 and A3. Similar to the process for physics-based model, we run the 5-fold cross-validation experiments for 100 times, and plotted the CV-RMSEs of the SVM, XGBoost, and ANN in Fig. 6 . We found the XGBoost has the lowest prediction errors on both the training and testing datasets. The over-fitting of XGBoost is more severe than the other two algorithms, as the CV-RMSE difference between the training and test sets of the XGBoost is 2.73%, larger than the difference of 0.65% and 0.9% for the SVM and ANN respectively. 4 Discussion 4.1 Physics-based versus machine learning model The CV-RMSE of the best performing physics-based models and data-driven models are plotted in Fig. 7 . Again, we observed a consistent ranking on both the training and validation dataset. XGBoost and SVM models are more accurate than other models, followed by the physics-based model proposed by Hu. Specifically, the CV-RMSEs of the XGBoost are 2.9% and 0.4% smaller than Hu\u2019s model on the training and testing dataset. These findings suggest that, in the context of the real-world VRF operational data we have, the machine learning models outperform the physics-based models. Meanwhile, it can be observed that the physics-based models are more generalizable than the data-driven models. As the performance degradation between the training and testing set is smaller for the physics-based model, compared with the data-driven models. This observation is consistent to what we expected and to existing studies [41]. Data-driven models rely on universal approximators, the performance of which highly depends on training data. For those domains that the training data do not cover, there is no guarantee that data-driven models can be accurate [41]. However, physics-based models relies on both physical principles (also known as the first principles) and the training data. As the physics laws are generalizable, it can work well even in domains that the training data do not cover. Another perspectives to compare data-driven models with physics-based models is the computational time and resources needed for model training. In our experiments, we found the average training time for the physics-based models was 53 s, while the average training time for the data-driven models was 339 s in our work station with Core i7 processor. Given the same hardware, the physics-based model requires less time to train. This feature is more significant if the hyper-parameter tuning process of the data-driven model is considered. The reason physics-based models are more efficient to train is data-driven model relies on universal approximators, which has a large parameter space to search. Due to the above two reasons (generalizability and computational efficiency), we recommend to use a physics-based model for control purposes. 4.2 Features\u2019 impacts on VRF efficiency We are also curious about which inputs features significantly impact the VRF efficiency. We first conducted a correlation analysis, as shown in Fig. A1, and identified a strong correlation between compressor frequency, fan speed, and cooling capacity. Therefore, we select compressor frequency as the representative variables from this group. Even though the data-driven models are more accurate than the physics-based models, we select physics-based models to conduct this analysis, because physics-based models are more generalizable than data-driven models, as we found in Section 4.1. Considering that the model proposed by Hu et al. [31] is the most accurate physics-based models, we use Hu\u2019s model [31] in this study. The identified parameters for Hu\u2019s model are summarized in Table A4 . The impacts of indoor dry bulb temperature, outdoor dry bulb temperature, and compressor frequency on COP of VRF system is plotted in Fig. 8 . From Fig. 8(a), it can be seen that VRF\u2019s COP decreases with the increasing outdoor dry bulb temperature, and the increasing of indoor dry bulb temperature. This observation is consistent with the second law of thermodynamics. From Fig. 8(b), it can be seen that the COP increases slightly with the increase in compressor frequency, which means the VRF will become less efficient in partial load operation, however this efficiency drop is marginal. In real world VRF operation, the indoor temperature usually is controlled within a small range, while the outdoor temperature can vary a lot in different weather conditions. Therefore, the outdoor temperature is the primary factor that determines the VRF system efficiency. VRF will be less efficient when the compressor frequency is smaller than the rated value, but the impact of compressor frequency on VRF system COP is marginal. 5 Conclusion This study aims to summarize and compare different VRF models. We first found sixteen VRF models from a comprehensive literature review. Then, we validated and compared the reviewed models using a real-world VRF operational datasets. Additionally, we compared the physics-based models with data-driven models. The following conclusions can be drawn: (1) Among the sixteen reviewed physics-based models, Hu\u2019s model [31], which regresses the cooling capacity and COP as a linear combination of indoor and outdoor temperature times a cubic function of compressor frequency, is the most accurate, with a CV-RMSE of 22.19% and 22.44% on the training and testing dataset respectively. (2) Among the three machine learning models, XGBoost outperforms SVM and ANN on both the training and testing datasets. (3) XGBoost and SVM models are more accurate than physics-based models. However, the data-driven models are less generalizable than physics-based models and are more likely to suffer from over-fitting issues. (4) The sensitivity analysis shows that outdoor and indoor temperature have significant impacts on VRF system efficiency. For variable-speed VRF system, its COP will decrease with reducing compressor frequency, however this impact is marginal. We believe the findings of this study can help researchers to select the proper VRF model for building energy prediction, model-based optimization, and fault diagnostic and detection.

        "dc:description": "Variable Refrigerant Flow (VRF) systems are gradually gaining popularity in small and medium-sized commercial and residential buildings owing to their high part-load performance, flexible control, and ease of installation and maintenance. Developing models of VRF systems to predict their performance are important for model-based control, fault diagnostic and detection. There are VRF models published in existing literatures, however those models were developed and validated in different datasets. As a result, the model accuracy cannot be directly compared. To fill this gap, this paper presents a comprehensive review of the existing VRF models, and summarizes the input/output parameters and mathematical formulas of 16 VRF models from literature (referred to as physics-based model). Next, we validate and compare the model accuracy of existing models using the same dataset. Additionally, we develop data-driven models using the state-of-art machine learning algorithms, and compare the model accuracy between existing physics-based models with data-driven models. We find the model proposed by Hu et al. in 2019, which regresses the VRF cooling capacity and COP as a linear combination of indoor and outdoor temperatures times a cubed polynomial function of compressor frequency, is the most accurate physics-based model, with a prediction error of 22.19% in the training dataset and 22.44% in the validation dataset. XGBoost is the most accurate data-driven model, with a prediction error of 19.29% in the training dataset and 22.02% in the validation dataset. The data-driven model is more accurate while the physics-based model is more generalizable. The findings of this study can help researchers to select the proper VRF model for building energy prediction, model-based optimization, and fault diagnostic and detection.",
