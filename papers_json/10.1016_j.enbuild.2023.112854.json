The design, commissioning, and retrofit of heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) control systems are crucially important for energy efficiency. However, designers and control contractors adopt ad-hoc control sequences based on diffused and fragmented information; therefore, most of the existing control sequences are diverse and sub-optimal. ASHRAE Guideline 36 (GDL36), High-performance Sequences of Operation (SOO) for HVAC Systems, was thus developed to provide standardized and high-performance rule-based HVAC control sequences with the main focus on maximizing energy efficiency. However, only limited studies verify the performance of these high-performance rules-based control and most of these studies focus on the single-zone systems. In this Modelica-based simulation study, the high-performance rule-based control sequences from GDL36 were compared to the state-of-the-art intelligent controllers (i.e., optimization-based controller (OBC) and deep reinforcement-learning-based controller (DRLC)) in terms of the energy efficiency and thermal comfort. The performance evaluation was conducted in a medium-sized office building with a multi-zone Variable Air Volume (VAV) cooling system. The OBC and DRLC replaced the GDL36 airside supervisory level control loops. In other words, the optimal supply air temperature (SAT) and static differential pressure (DP) setpoints were determined by the optimization problems in OBC and trained control policy by DRLC. The OBC and DRLC were formulated to minimize the HVAC energy consumption and zone air temperature violation. The OBCs with different control intervals and DRLCs with different hyperparameters in the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm were exploited and fine-tuned. The simulation results show that the GDL36 has a comparable energy performance (within a 3% deviation) with DRLC in the cases with high or mild cooling loads. It also has a comparable energy performance (within a 3% deviation) with OBC in the case of a high cooling load. However, the case with GDL36 consumed 7% more energy in the testing shoulder period. For the thermal comfort metric, the GDL36 has slightly more zone air temperature violations in all testing scenarios compared to the two intelligent controllers. From this case study, we can conclude that the GDL36 has demonstrated its comparable performance in terms of energy efficiency and thermal comfort with the two intelligent controllers. The GDL36 airside SOO is good enough considering the complexity and tuning efforts of the intelligent controllers.

Despite the significant role of the HVAC control systems in energy efficiency, the design, commissioning, and retrofit have long been an intricate and complicated issue, considering that only diffuse and fragmented information on the system operation is available for decision-making in most scenarios. Due to this limitation, designers and control contractors have to rely on ad-hoc control sequences for system operation in practice, which is one of the major reasons why buildings are operated sub-optimally. To provide standardized and high-performance HVAC control sequences, the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) has developed the Guideline 36 (GDL36) High-Performance Sequences of Operation (SOO) for HVAC Systems [2] to maximize energy efficiency, occupant comfort, and wellbeing. The GDL36 aims at publishing and maintaining the best-in-class sequences for various HVAC system types. The 2018 version largely depends on the ASHRAE project RP-1455 [3] and covers mostly the airside systems, e.g., variable air volume (VAV) systems, dual duct systems, zone terminal boxes, etc. It will be continuously developed with state-of-the-art research on the high-performance rule-based SOO for HVAC systems and expand the coverage to the whole building systems and configurations. Fig. 1 shows the timeline of the development of the GDL36 and associated ASHRAE projects in the past, present, and future. In the most recent update, the high-performance waterside SOO was integrated to ASHRAE Guideline36-2021 [2] from the completed ASHRAE project RP-1711 [4]. The added SOO includes the control sequences from the chilled water plant, the hot water plant, and the fan-coil unit. The aforementioned control sequences collected in GDL36 belong to prescriptive and feedback-based reactive control. In this type of control, different setpoints or schedules are determined at the supervisory level based on the heuristic rules and then the Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) local controls at the HVAC equipment level are used to track the setpoints. The energy efficiency performance of GDL36 has been demonstrated by limited lab/field tests and simulation-based studies [1,5,6], as tabulated in Table 1 . Rodriguez [7] conducted an experiment in a commercial building air handling unit (AHU), and showed that excessive outside air was used before the control retrofit and building cooling energy use was reduced after the GDL36 SOO was implemented. The control retrofit using the GDL36 airside SOO in 555 County Center [8], a five-story office building in California, indicated that a 15 % of the whole building electricity use and a 56 % of natural gas use were saved in the first year of the testing. A medium building in Vallejo, California, was retrofitted by implementing the GDL36 SOO [9]. The control sequence retrofits reduced annual energy bills by over $200,000 and heating energy use by more than 55 %. These two field demonstrations showed a simple payback year of 6.7 and 8.9 years, respectively. Wetter et al. [6] simulated the airside GDL36 SOO in a single-floor medium office building model and reported a 30 % annual site energy usage saving for the HVAC system with acceptable thermal comfort compared to the old SOO published in 2006 by ASHRAE [10]. Zhang et al. [11] implemented and verified both airside and waterside control sequences in a Modelica-based simulation environment for a single-zone VAV system. Their simulation results showed that the GDL36 SOO yielded a 17.3 % of annual HVAC energy saving compared to the conventional baseline control strategy. In a follow-up study, Zhang et al. [12] estimated the energy saving of the control retrofit for multi-zone variable air volume systems using Spawn of EnergyPlus. The results showed the GDL36 SOO could provide a wide range of HVAC energy savings with an average savings of 31 % in different climates, internal loads, and HVAC system operation periods. Overall, the energy-saving potential from retrofitting existing controls to the GDL36 SOO had yet been shown for a wide range of cases [12], as summarized in Table 1. These existing studies indicate the design and commissioning of the HVAC system control sequences could have a substantial impact on building energy efficiency. The airside control retrofits following high-performance SOO could achieve energy savings up to 30 % and more compared to the conventional rule-based control. However, achievable savings from the high-performance SOO in other HVAC subsystems are still unknown (e.g., airside controls together with waterside controls). In addition, the energy saving potential of high-performance SOO compared to the state-of-the-art intelligent controls as the benchmark is also unclear. Therefore, there is a practical need to benchmark the GDL36 SOO with other state-of-the-art intelligent controls. Two types of intelligent controls are widely studied in building controls [13]. The first is the optimization-based controllers, which consider the real-time or predictive information and thus be able to adapt to the changing building climate conditions, occupancy, etc. Model Predictive Control (MPC) represents the state of the art of this real-time optimal control. The other type is the learning-based method, e.g., the reinforcement learning-based controller. Although the latter two intelligent building control methods can notably reduce the energy use (e.g., building systems integrated with storage systems or distributed energy resources), high computational requirements and scalability issues have been imposed on the widespread adoption [14]. Given the common pros and cons of different building controls, it is imperative to conduct an apples-to-apples comparison of these building controls to justify the respective energy saving benefits. 1.1 Literature review 1.1.1 Optimization-based controllers in buildings The optimization-based controllers (e.g., real-time optimal control (ROC) and model predictive control (MPC)) have attracted broad attentions in research academia for optimal building operations. These research studies included the optimal control strategies of multi-zone VAV systems [15,16], single-zone VAV systems [17], chilled water systems [18], cooling water systems [19], and building energy storage [20]. For the real-time optimal controls, optimization actions are conducted under a fixed frequency or a predefined timetable during the operation of HVAC systems. For example, Nassif et al. [21] employed a bi-objective genetic scheme where the supervisory level control setpoints were optimized every 30 min with respect to energy use and occupants\u2019 thermal comfort. However, this kind of time-based real-time optimal control may not effectively respond to the changing building operating conditions such as the weather and occupant behavior [22]. Furthermore, there is a potential computational waste under the time period when the operating conditions are stable, and the optimization is unnecessary. Therefore, in the last decade, MPCs have been widely studied for the optimal control of building systems but the majorities of the studies are simulation-based ones [23]. MPC can be explained literally by three words: model, predictive, control. The system mathematical \u201cmodel\u201d (together with the current measurements) and \u201cpredictive\u201d information, are used to optimize the \u201ccontrol\u201d inputs by minimizing a given objective function over a finite prediction horizon [23]. MPC has demonstrated its energy saving potential in simulations and also several experimental field testing in real buildings [24\u201326]. However, the major challenge lies in its complexity regarding the MPC design and controller tuning. It is not only labor-intensive but also requires expertise for control design and commissioning. Huang et al. [27] investigated several critical settings, including the model interval, control sampling interval, and prediction horizon in MPC for building controls. Drgona et al. [23] outlined current bottlenecks and challenges for the wide adoption of MPC in real buildings. They predicted that the large-scale market penetration of MPC can be expected to happen within the next decade with a few optimistic conditions such as increasing pilot case studies, emerging startups, and awareness of the major companies in the field of building controls. There exist several studies on developing optimization-based control strategies for commercial building VAV systems. Koehler et al. [28] proposed an explicit MPC and compared its performance with the Trim and Respond (T&R) control schemes for a multi-zone VAV system. The simulation results of both control schemes are similar. Liang et al. [29] designed an auto-regressive moving average exogenous (ARMAX)-based MPC scheme for optimizing the supply air temperature (SAT), the outside air flow rate, and the recirculation air damper ratio. Compared to the original rule-based supervisory controls, the simulation results showed that a 27.8 % energy saving on average could be achieved in the testing period of 25 days. Raman et al. [30] proposed a hierarchical MPC for multi-zone VAV systems with a high-level controller deciding the AHU-level control commands based on low-resolution large meta-zone models and a projection-based low-level controller using both MPC\u2019s decisions and feedback from zones. The proposed controller significantly reduced energy use compared to the baseline controller, which used fixed air temperatures and fixed outdoor air flow rates for AHU commands and dual-maximum VAV box control logic for zone-level commands. 1.1.2 Reinforcement Learning-based controllers in buildings Reinforcement learning (RL) has attracted tremendous research interests in solving high-dimensional complex control and optimization problems due to the vast development of deep learning and RL algorithms in the last decade [31,32]. Optimal building controls are one of the complicated problems due to the multivariant actions and dynamic energy demand. RL is a category of machine learning algorithms that aims to learn an optimal control policy from the direct interaction between the agent and the environment. The agent will perform empirical learning and decide on the action to drive the environment towards a favorable trajectory according to a predefined reward function. In mathematics, RL problems could be formalized as Markov decision processes (MDP), in which the agent and the environment interact at a sequence of discrete time steps. Fig. 2 depicts the interaction process. For the time step t, the agent receives representation information of the environment, named state St . In turn, the agent computes actions based on the current control policy π and send back to the environment a control action At . Policy π maps states to actions which represents the probability that the agent will take the action At under the state St . One time step later, the agent observes a new state St+1 from the environment along with its reward Rt+1 , which indicates the feedback from the environment after taking the action At . During this interaction, the RL agent aims to find an optimal policy π ∗ as shown in Eq. (1) based on various RL algorithms. For the model-based RL algorithms, the optimal policy π ∗ could be obtained by Dynamic Programming while in the model-free RL the agent learns the optimal policy π ∗ through the interaction with the environment [31]. (1) π ∗ ∈ arg max π J ( π ) = E S 0 μ 0 E π ∑ t = 0 ∞ γ t r ( S t , A t ) where E S 0 μ 0 is the expectation that initial state s 0 is drawn from an initial state distribution μ 0 and E π is the expectation that the action A t is taken based on the policy. γ is the discount factor that normalizes the reward r . Compared to the model-based RL, the model-free RL is investigated more in building applications [13]. The model-free RL could be further divided into value-based and policy-based methods. As a conventional valued-based method, Q-learning is a table-based algorithm. The Q-value table will decide the next action based on the current state and the algorithm will continuously update the Q-table. With the development of the deep learning methods, the Q-table is replaced by a deep neural network (DNN) that belongs to the deep-Q neural network (DQN) algorithm, especially for the case that has large dimensions of states and agents. In that case, the Q-learning approach becomes no longer efficient. For the policy-based RL algorithms such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) [33], the optimal policy in Eq. (1) is parameterized as π θ with regards to θ and RL formulation becomes Eq. (2) to find the optimal policy θ ∗ . The policy gradient theorem is employed to update the policy θ. (2) θ ∗ ∈ arg max θ ∈ Θ J ( θ ) Different researchers have investigated the application of model-free RL controllers in building systems, including single air-conditioning units [34,35], VAV systems [36\u201340], radiant heating systems [41,42], building envelope[43], and whole HVAC systems [44\u201347]. Despite the reported benefits after the successful controller tuning, the model-free RL controllers are subject to the issues such as the long training period and stability issues. There exist several studies on developing the RL strategies for the commercial building VAV systems. Yuan et al. [38] applied the Q-learning-based RL in both single-zone and multi-zone VAV systems to optimize the supply airflow rate. Despite the achieved energy saving over the baseline control, details on the baseline control are unclear. In addition, it is not clear whether the control design of the AHU-level control loops was considered or not. Wei et al. [48] used deep Q network (DQN) algorithms for the optimal airflow control of the multi-zone VAV systems. The simulation experiments demonstrated the deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithm was more effective in an energy cost reduction compared with the rule-based controllers. Hanumaiah et al. [49] proposed a distributed multi-agent DRL framework for the optimal control of multi-zone systems. The impact of the reward ratio and the weather on different model-free RL performances was discussed. Ding et al. [50] developed a model-based RL with a model predictive path integral control method to the multi-zone VAV. The results showed that the proposed controller could achieve about 11 % more energy savings on average in two testing months compared to the rule-based benchmark while maintaining similar thermal comfort. Furthermore, the training time was reduced significantly compared to the model-free RL benchmark. 1.1.3 Comparison studies of intelligent building controllers To demonstrate benefits of these intelligent controllers, different benchmarking framework were developed to facilitate a fair evaluation of algorithms and shed lights on best practices for intelligent controllers in buildings [51\u201357]. Using a standardized building optimization testing (BOPTEST) framework [53], Arroyo et al. [51] compared three types of intelligent controllers (MPC, RL, and reinforced MPC) in a Modelica-based single-zone residential system. The results reveal that RL approaches poorly perform compared to MPC under realistic building system dynamics. Similarly, Stoffel et al. [57] evaluated five intelligent controllers in a single-zone building including black-box MPC, gray-box MPC, and white-box MPC with RL and approximate MPC. They considered both qualitative metrics (i.e., energy consumption, thermal comfort) and quantitative criteria (i.e., adaptability, interpretability, and required know-how). Fu et al. [52] proposed a containerized framework to compare the MPC and DRL algorithms in a single zone VAV system. The results show that DRL can outperform MPC after a long training time in their specific case study. In their follow-up study [58], the MPC and DRL are compared on their approximation levels to the true optimality for the load shifting applications. 1.2 Motivations Although the aforementioned literature review demonstrates the energy saving potential of the intelligent control strategies, there exist few studies that compare the performance of intelligent controllers with the high-performance rule-based control sequences of operation, i.e., ASHRAE Guideline 36. In addition, the benchmark control strategies in most existing evaluation studies are the PID and on\u2013off controllers. For example, the benchmark rule-based controller for the zone air temperature (ZAT) controller is the simple on\u2013off control in Wei et al. [48]. Essentially speaking, the GDL36 SOO is simpler and easier for the field implementation compared to the OBC and RL controllers. The heuristic rules in GDL36 could improve the energy efficiency; however, the improvement may be constrained by the incapability of predictive and adaptive learning, which could be necessary for buildings with more integrations with modern grid (e.g., demand response, etc.). OBC and RL controllers have their own obvious challenges and limitations, which prevent their wide adoption in field applications at the current stage. 1.3 Paper organization In this context, this study presents an energy performance comparison of GDL36 SOO and two types of intelligent controllers within the same building virtual testbed. The remaining sections are organized as follows and shown in Fig. 3 . Section 2 details the case study description and the virtual testbed. Section 3 describes the formulation and implementation of the optimization-based controller (OBC) and deep reinforcement learning-based controller (DRLC). Section 4 and Section 5 discuss and compare the energy efficiency comparison and thermal comfort results of these two intelligent controllers with those results of the ASHRAE Guideline 36. 2 Description of case study This case study aims to compare the energy efficiency and thermal comfort performance of the intelligent controllers with ASHRAE Guideline 36 for a multi-zone VAV cooling system, which is a typical HVAC system configuration in commercial buildings in the U.S.. As shown in Eq. (3)-(4), The energy efficiency is reflected by the cooling energy use for whole HVAC system ( E coo ) and the thermal comfort is quantified using zone air temperature violation ( dT vio ) during system operation hours (i.e., 7 am \u2013 7 pm). (3) E coo = ∑ t 0 t N E HVAC t i = ∑ t 0 t N E fan t i + ∑ t 0 t N E plant t i (4) dT vio ( t 0 , t N ) = ∑ z ∈ Z ∑ t 0 t N | s z ( t i ) | where N is the sampling number for each operation time step point t. E Fan and E Plant are energy use for the AHU fan and the plant system. z is the zone index for the set of zones, and s z is deviation from the lower and upper zone setpoint temperatures. The zone air cooling temperature setpoint is 24 ℃, and the allowable deviation in this study is ± 0.5 ℃ from the setpoint. Since the first published version of ASHRAE GDL36 [59] only contains the control sequences on the airside systems, this study focuses on the comparison of the rule-based airside high-performance sequences with the intelligent controllers. Another assumption is that the comparison is conducted at the supervisory level, which is the overall control of the local subsystems [60]. For the airside control SOO of multi-zone VAV systems in GDL36, there exist several critical supervisory level controls, e.g., AHU supply air temperature (SAT) reset, static differential pressure (DP) setpoint reset, and economizer damper controls. In this comparison study, the first two controls are replaced by the counterpart in two intelligent controllers. For the AHU SAT reset SOO in GDL36, as shown in Fig. 4 (a), the SAT is reset based on the outdoor air temperature (OAT) and the setpoint request from the zone terminal units to find a balance between the fan energy and cooling energy consumptions. To be specific, the setpoint shall be reset from minimum cooling SAT (Min_ClgSAT) when the outdoor air temperature is maximum OAT (OAT_Max) and above, proportionally up to maximum SAT (T-max) when the outdoor air temperature is minimum OAT (OAT_Min) and below. T-max is reset using T&R logic based on the zone-level reset requests between Min_ClgSAT and maximum cooling SAT (Max_ClgSAT). More details can be found from ASHRAE GDL36 [59]. Fig. 4(b) depicts the principle of the static DP reset from the T&R logic, as specified in GDL36. Under this control logic, the system will tend towards minimum static pressure but respond to the increasing demand from the zone terminal units. The red cyclic pattern, as shown in Fig. 4(b), is a general characteristic of a robust T&R loop, and the setpoint is not expected to remain static except at its minimum and maximum values. Compared to the high-performance SOO in GDL36, in this study, the SAT and the static DP will be determined by the optimization in OBC and the control policy in DRLC. To ensure an apples-to-apples comparison, the local controls (e.g., zone-level PID controls) remain the same for the three controllers. Table 2 lists the differences of SOO between the three controller types. The simulation experiment was for Chicago, IL, USA (ASHRAE climate zone 5A) in two typical weeks of different cooling loads, i.e., a cooling week (07/24\u201307/31) and a shoulder week (06/09\u201306/16). The cooling week has a high average outdoor air temperature, and the shoulder week has a mild cooling load which enables a long operation period of an airside economizer. The simulated building was a single-floor five-zone VAV system with both airside and waterside control sequences of GDL36 [61]. The original model was developed from a five-zone medium office building model Guideline36 in Modelica Buildings Library 7.0.0 [62]. The original Guideline36 model consists of a VAV system with terminal reheat units, a building envelope model, and a model for leakage air flow through building envelope and open doors. On top of that, in this study, a chilled water plant system and a boiler hot water system are added to the Guideline 36 model following the plant-side high-performance control sequences in the ASHRAE RP-1711 [4]. The developed virtual testbed schematics is shown in Fig. 5 . The testbed consists of four perimeter zones and one core zone, which is representative of one mid-floor of the new construction medium office building, as described in the set of U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Commercial Prototype Building Models [63]. Heating and cooling are delivered by a single-duct multi-zone VAV system. One AHU connected with five VAV terminal boxes serves five zones (four exterior zones and one interior zone, respectively) on one floor. The chilled water is supplied by a central chiller plant which consists of a chiller, a water-side economizer, a cooling tower, and associated one chilled water pump and one cooling water pump. A boiler, fed by the natural gas, supplies the hot water to the AHU heating coil. The reheat coils in the VAV terminals are electric resistance coils. The Modelica model has been verified through a cross-comparison with the EnergyPlus prototype medium office model [63]. The peak load and the HVAC system sizing in the Modelica system model are in the similar range with the EnergyPlus prototype model. The HVAC controls in Modelica model were implemented using the standardized Control Description Language [6] and verified in the open loop tests before being integrated in the system. The detailed model comparison and control sequences were described in Ref. [61]. To reduce the computational cost in this study, the detailed waterside model was replaced by the data-driven regression model for both the cooling season and the shoulder season, respectively, as shown in Eq. (5) and (6). (5) P plant = 11188 + 0.18 ∙ Q c o o + 24.24 ∙ T d b - 44.44 ∙ T w b - 0.05 (6) P plant = 726656 + 4.12 ∙ Q coo - 2816.1 ∙ T db - 2638.7 ∙ T wb + 26.2 ∙ H gh - 0.0037 Q coo ∙ T db - 0.0097 Q coo ∙ T wb + 2.01 ∙ 10 - 5 ∙ Q coo ∙ H gh + 10.2 ∙ T db T wb + 0.16 ∙ T db ∙ H gh - 0.25 ∙ T wb ∙ H gh where P plant is the chiller plant power energy consumption. Q coo is the cooling load at the AHU cooling coil, T db is the dry bulb outdoor air temperature, T wb is the wet bulb outdoor air temperature and H gh is the global horizontal solar radiation. Table 3 shows the statistical metrics of the regression model with a 15-mininute sampling rate. The coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (CV-RMSE), and normalized mean bias error (NMBE) all indicate the high accuracy of the regression models. As mentioned earlier, the system is sized under the ASHRAE climate zone 5A Chicago, IL [63,64]. 3 Controller formulation and implementation The formulation and implementation of OBC are described in Section 3.1. In Section 3.2, the experimental setups of DRLC are illustrated. 3.1 OBC The OBC in this study was formulated as a set of bi-objective optimization problems to minimize the HVAC total energy consumption while maintaining the ZAT within the comfort bound. Let N be the number of optimization intervals for the experiment time (1 week in this case). Within the i th optimization interval ( i ∊ [0,1\u2026, N-1]), the objective function (i.e., a given function that results in the minimum or maximum output from the function) is represented in Eq.(7). (7) J i = min u ( E HVAC , i u , x + α ∙ d T vio , i ( u , x ) ) where J i is the control objective as a function of both system state vector x and control input vector u at the ith optimization period. Control inputs u are the AHU SAT setpoint and the static DP setpoint, which are bounded within [12 ℃,18 ℃] and [25 Pa,410 Pa], respectively. E HVAC , i ∙ and dT vio , i ∙ are the functions of HVAC energy consumption and ZAT violation at the ith optimization period. α is the penalty coefficient, which prioritizes reducing energy consumption versus maintaining thermal comfort. Generally, a small α corresponds to a smaller HVAC energy consumption but a larger temperature violation and vice versa. An appropriate α needs to be tuned to keep a similar level of ZAT violation with the GDL36 controller in terms of magnitude (see Section 4.1). In this study, we assume a perfect model prediction in OBC and use the same model as discussed in Section 2 to calculate power consumption and temperature deviations. The optimal control setpoints in the experiment are thus determined through OBC. For the implementation, Dymola Optimization Library version 2.2.4 [65] was leveraged, which was a commercial package that provides tools for the multi-objective optimization of Modelica-based systems in Dymola. The simplex method was adopted as the optimization algorithm due to its fast computation speed as a local method. This method was explored with an acceptable performance in similar optimal control problems of HVAC systems [66,67]. Fig. 6 depicts the workflow of the OBC in Dymola. For the ith optimization interval, the optimized setpoints are obtained through running the Optimization Library. Then the system states are rolled back and the Dymola model is simulated with the optimized setpoints. After that, the states at that time step will be saved. This procedure is iterated until the end of the experiment. In this study, different lengths of the optimization interval (also control interval) are studied: 15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, and 4 h. 3.2 DRLC Similarly, the DRLC is formulated to minimize the HVAC total energy consumption while mitigating the ZAT violation by adjusting the AHU SAT setpoint and the AHU static pressure setpoint. Fig. 7 depicts the DRLC formulation. The reward R for the DRL is shown in Eq. (8), similar to the objective function for OBC in Eq.(7). (8) R i = - ( E HVAC , i + α ∙ d T vio , i ) where E HVAC , i are the HVAC energy consumption and dT vio , i are and ZAT violation at the ith control interval (i.e., 15 min each). α is the penalty coefficient that balances the energy consumption and thermal comfort. The control actions are bidimensional and the action space is a continuous space to avoid the curse of the dimension in the discretized action space. The states are determined based on HVAC engineering knowledge. Three different state spaces are considered, as shown in Table 4 . The commonly used states are time, outdoor air temperature, solar radiation, HVAC energy consumption, and ZAT violation. The simulation environment is the same GDL36 model as described in Section 2, which provides the reward value (R) and next observations (S\u2019) during the interaction with the DRLC. For the implementation, a standardized containerized framework [52] is leveraged where the building model is interfaced with the state-of-the-art DRL library Tianshou [68] through the functional mockup unit (FMU). Tianshou is a highly modularized DRL library in Python based on pure PyTorch [69] and has supported more than 20 classic algorithms. Tianshou\u2019s performances are reported to be comparable or better than the best reported results for most algorithms in the open literature [68]. In this study, the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) [70] is selected as the algorithm because it suits the continuous action space in our case and is relatively simpler for users to implement and tune algorithms. Still, PPO training process involves the need to tune the hyperparameters to achieve a desirable level of performance. Following hyperparameters could have significant impacts on the DRLC performance [71,72]. For example, Step Per Collect (also called Time Horizon), i.e., how many steps to collect before adding it to the experience buffer; Batch size (also called Minibatch), i.e., how many experiences are used for each gradient descent update; Entropy coefficient i.e., a regularizer that helps the exploration; and Updated time, i.e., how many times the data collected are reused, etc. To fine-tune the proposed DRLC, as recommended in Ref. [73], various other factors are also considered, including the penalty coefficient, the state design, the neural network (NN) layer, etc. The penalty coefficient α was first swept to determine the appropriate value that keeps a similar level of ZAT violation with the GDL36 controller. Then different common values are grid-searched in other aspects to find the best hyperparameters. Table 5 lists the sweeping parameters for tuning the DRLC. The DRL policy is trained and tested for 800 epochs in each scenario (i.e., different combinations of parameters). One epoch length is one week. The computation time for one epoch training takes around 10 min on a Windows 10 machine with Intel® Core™ i5-9500 @3.00 GHz CPU and 16 GB RAM. That being said, the training time for 800 epochs would be around 5.5 days. Due to the large computation cost for the hyperparameter tuning of the DRLC, different scenarios are assigned to different cores in the high-performance computing cluster. 4 Comparison results In this section, the simulation experimental results for the OBC and DRLC after fine-tuning are reported, respectively in Section 4.1 and Section 4.2. 4.1 OBC As mentioned earlier in Section 3.1, different α values decide on the balance of the HVAC energy consumption and thermal comfort. Fig. 8 depicts one example of the effect of α in the cooling season week. It can be seen that a small α corresponds to a smaller HVAC energy consumption but a larger temperature violation and vice versa. With an α larger than 25, the OBC could achieve the same level of thermal comfort but also a modest energy saving. Therefore, for the cooling season, we use the value of 25 for α . Similar investigation was conducted for the shoulder season, and the value of 25 was also selected. 4.1.1 Cooling season results The OBC performance in the cooling season week (07/24\u201307/31) under different control intervals are discussed in this section. Table 6 summarizes the results for all the OBCs and the GDL36 controller, including the HVAC energy consumption, ZAT violation, and the integrated objective function. For the cooling season week, the OBC with the smallest control interval (i.e., 15 min) has the lowest objective function (i.e., a weighted summation of energy consumption and ZAT violation). However, compared to the savings from the cases of OBC-30 min and OBC-1 h, such saving is relatively marginal. For the control interval larger than 2 h, the ZAT violation could not be maintained at the comparable level of GDL36 SOO. Fig. 9 depicts the detailed time series of optimal setpoints and HVAC energy consumption under GDL36, OBCs with 30-minute optimization interval (denoted as OBC-30 min), and OBCs with 2-hour optimization interval (denoted as OBC-2 h) during 07/24\u201307/31. For aesthetic reasons (avoid line overlapping), only these two representative OBCs (OBC-30 min, OBC-2 h) are depicted. From Fig. 9 (a) and (b), the three lines of setpoints generally follow a similar trend except at the early hour each day. Especially, for the case of OBC-30 min, the static DP setpoint is at the highest level at the early hour. This is because the optimizer tries to minimize the ZAT violation by providing more air flows. The oscillation of static DP setpoints is observed for the GDL36 SOO due to the T&R control while such behavior barely appears for the OBC cases. Fig. 9(c) indicates that the HVAC power consumption for the three controllers is in a similar range in the cooling season week. Fig. 10 shows the detailed energy results for the whole HVAC system and subsystems. It can be seen that all three controllers share a similar power consumption profile with the OBC controllers expending slightly less power. Fig. 11 is the time series plot for the five-zone air temperatures in the cooling season week. There are more oscillations for ZAT in GDL36 SOO due to the coordination between the T&R control and zone-level control. It is also noted that the ZAT under OBC cases has more time wandering near the upper and lower bounds compared to the case with GDL36 SOO. In addition, the ZAT in the case of OBC-2 h has a larger violation than that in the case of OBC-30 min in some zones (e.g., west, north, and core zones), especially in early and late hours each day. This is because a 2-hour control interval is not short enough to control the zone air temperature within the comfort bound at a certain period. Fig. 12 (a) depicts the box plot of the ZAT distributions. All OBC cases have a dense distribution near the upper bound compared to the GDL36 case. Fig. 12(b) illustrates the accumulated ZAT violation through the week and we can also verify that the OBC case with a control interval of 2 h has a larger violation than the GDL36 case. 4.1.2 Shoulder season results The OBC performance in the shoulder season week (06/09\u201306/16) under different control intervals are discussed in this section. Table 7 summarizes the results for all the case of OBCs and GDL36 controller in the shoulder season week, including the HVAC energy consumption, ZAT violation, and the integrated objective function. Unlike the results in the cooling season week, the case of OBC with the smallest control interval (i.e., 15 min) does not have the lowest energy consumption and ZAT violation probably due to the continuous ramping of the control setpoints. Instead, the case of OBC-30 min has the least integrated cost with an energy saving ratio of 7 %. Similar to the cooling season week, with the control interval larger than 2 h, the ZAT violation could not be maintained at the comparable level of GDL36 SOO. The following analysis explains why a larger HVAC energy saving ratio is achieved in the shoulder season week. Fig. 13 depicts the detailed time series of optimal setpoints and HVAC energy consumption for cases with GDL36, OBC-30 min, and OBC-2 h in the shoulder season week. Fig. 13(a) and (b) show the optimal SAT setpoint and static DP setpoint. Different from the cooling season results, the optimal setpoints for the OBCs have more upwards and downwards ramping in the shoulder season to balance the cooling and fan energy consumption. It is apparent that on the Day of 06/10, the OBCs save more HVAC energy consumption than other days. Detailed results for the day of 06/10 are shown in Fig. 14 . The airside economizer was enabled during the whole day. According to the GDL36 SOO, the SAT setpoint was reset to the maximum value in order to fully utilize the free cooling offered by the outdoor air. However, cooling loads in some zones cannot be covered and thus the static DP was increased based on the zone requests. In contrast, the SAT setpoints determined by the OBC were generally equal to or slightly lower than the outdoor air temperature. In this way, the cooling energy from the plant system did not increase a lot. The zone cooling loads were met, and the fan energy was saved. For the energy efficiency performance of the other days, the case of OBCs perform at parity with or slightly better than the case of GDL36. 4.2 DRLC In this section, the experimental results for DRLC after the hyperparameter tuning are analyzed in the cooling week. To avoid the repetition, the shoulder season results is not presented here. Recall that for each scenario (i.e., the combination of the hyperparameters), the DRL policy has been trained and tested for 800 epochs (each epoch denotes one week). 4.2.1 Cooling season results Fig. 15 illustrates the rewards under different scenarios using the parallel coordinate plot. Each line denotes one epoch under different combinations of the hyperparameters. The color of the line refers to the reward value. The redder represents the higher reward value, while the bluer delegates the lower reward value. The reward value of the case with GDL36 SOO is annotated in the color bar on the right side. It can be seen that the DRLC under the cooling season needs to be trained for at least 300 epochs. The larger number of Step Per Collect and Repeat Per Collect is generally beneficial to the final rewards but increases the DRLC training time. Fig. 16 shows the reward evolution throughout the epochs for the best scenario in the cooling season week. The hyperparameter setting for the best scenario is also included in the upper part of this figure. The blue line represents the entire reward for the GDL36 SOO. It can be seen that after 800 epochs of training, the DRLC performance in the cooling season week could nearly chase up with the GDL36 SOO in terms of the reward. The HVAC energy consumption for the best scenario of DRLC increases 2.2 % compared to the GDL36 SOO while decreasing 0.83 K∙h temperature violation in the cooling season week. This indicates the energy efficiency performance of GDL36 SOO is comparable to DRLC in the cooling week for this specific study. In addition, the DRLC is still subject to the curse of the high training time to achieve comparable performance. Fig. 17 and Fig. 18 show the detailed energy and thermal comfort results for the DRLC in the cooling season week. Compared to the SAT setpoints in GDL36 staying at the lowest value (i.e., 12 ℃), the SAT setpoints have a frequent variation between 12 and 14 ℃ in the case of DRLC. For the static DP setpoints, the DRLC generally has a higher value throughout the operation hours. Fig. 17(c) shows that the DRLC lines of HVAC power consumption overlap for most of the days with the GDL36 SOO, while DRLC expending slightly less power in some periods. For simplicity, instead of visualizing ZAT for five zones, Fig. 18 depicts the time series of ZAT in critical zones (i.e., east and south zones). Although the DRLC consumes more HVAC energy, it has fewer oscillations of ZAT and less frequent violation out of the bounds. 5 Discussions Section 5 presents the discussions on the performance evaluations of two intelligent controllers with GDL36 SOO. Based on the detailed results and analysis in Section 4.1 and Section 4.2, the comparison of three types of controllers is summarized in Table 8 for both cooling and shoulder season weeks. 5.1 HVAC energy consumption For the HVAC energy consumption in the cooling season week, the OBC saves 2.2 %, but the DRLC consumes 2.3 % more compared to GDL36 SOO. In the shoulder season week, the OBC and the DRLC save 7.0 % and 2.4 %, respectively. The savings are mainly from the day 06/10. On that day, the outdoor air temperature is low, but the zone load is still high. The GDL36 resets its SAT to the maximum. However, the zone load cannot be met, therefore a large fan energy consumption is compensated. That day is one example that showcases the benefits of intelligent controllers compared with the reactive controllers such as the GDL36 SOO. 5.2 Thermal comfort Three controllers can all maintain the ZAT setpoints for the thermal comfort metric within the predefined comfort bounds with minor temperature violations. Comparatively, cases with intelligent controllers have slightly fewer temperature violations than the cases with GDL36 SOO. However, it is noted that there are more oscillations for ZAT in the case with GDL36 SOO than those in other intelligent controllers due to the discrete time control logic (i.e., trim and respond control) implemented in GDL36 SOO. 5.3 Integrated performance Fig. 19 depicts the integrated performance of energy consumption and thermal comfort for the two typical weeks. It can be seen that the GDL36 is comparable to DRLC in two typical weeks but slightly inferior to the OBC. Therefore, we can conclude the GDL36 has demonstrated its comparable performance in terms of energy efficiency and thermal comfort with the two intelligent controllers. The GDL36 is good enough considering the complexity and tuning efforts of the intelligent controllers as described in Section 3. 6 Conclusions, limitations, and future work ASHRAE GDL36 has demonstrated the energy efficiency benefits over conventional rule-based controls; however only limited studies have been done for evaluations for their performance against the advanced intelligent controllers. In this study, the energy and thermal comfort performance of GDL36 are compared with two intelligent controllers: OBC and DRLC. This study is conducted with a five-zone VAV cooling system virtual testbed in Chicago, IL. The baseline control system is implemented with the high-performance airside and waterside GDL36 SOO. The OBC and DRLC replace the airside supervisory level control loops. In other words, the optimal SAT and static DP are determined by the optimization problems in OBCs and trained control policy by DRLC. The OBC and DRLC were formulated to minimize the HVAC energy consumption and zone air temperature violation. The OBCs with different control intervals and DRLCs with different hyperparameters in the PPO algorithm were studied and fine-tuned. The results showed that the GDL36 SOO has a comparable energy performance (within a 3 % deviation) with DRLC in cases with both high and mild cooling loads. It also has a comparable energy performance (within a 3 % deviation) with the OBC case of a high cooling load, but it expends 7 % more energy in the tested shoulder period. The energy saving of the OBC mainly comes from one particular day when the outdoor air temperature is moderate, but the zone load is still high. The GDL36 resets its SAT to the maximum. However, the zone load still cannot be met, so considerable fan energy is compensated. This case demonstrates the weakness of GDL36 due to its reactive nature. For the thermal comfort metric, the GDL36 has slightly more ZAT violations in both typical weeks compared to the two intelligent controllers. For this case study, the airside SOO in GDL36 has demonstrated comparable performance in terms of energy efficiency and thermal comfort with the two intelligent controllers. The airside SOOs in GDL36 are good enough, considering the complexity and tuning efforts of the intelligent controllers. However, there are several limitations of this study to be noted. First, the intelligent controllers are formulated ideally only for theoretical comparison studies. For OBCs, the predictive model is assumed to be the same as the virtual testbed, while in real applications, the system model identification needs to be conducted. For DRLCs, the control policies are trained and deployed for the same period, which is also not realistic in practice. Second, the performance of OBCs and the DRLCs might be further improved by considering more complex aspects. For example, the current OBCs only consider scenarios under the prediction horizon as one control timestep. For DRLCs, only the PPO algorithm is explored, and other DRL algorithms are not studied. Therefore, theoretical comparison studies with more practical and complicated intelligent controllers are required as an important future research direction. In addition, due to the significant development effort and large computation time for using a Modelica-based virtual testbed, the simulation-based study is only experimented in a five-zone medium office building, one single climate zone, and only cooling season. The effect of the climate, building type, internal loads, and operation time on the final results are not investigated. Therefore, future work also includes expanding the evaluation studies to other building types with different HVAC systems and climate zones.

        "dc:description": "The design, commissioning, and retrofit of heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) control systems are crucially important for energy efficiency. However, designers and control contractors adopt ad-hoc control sequences based on diffused and fragmented information; therefore, most of the existing control sequences are diverse and sub-optimal. ASHRAE Guideline 36 (GDL36), High-performance Sequences of Operation (SOO) for HVAC Systems, was thus developed to provide standardized and high-performance rule-based HVAC control sequences with the main focus on maximizing energy efficiency. However, only limited studies verify the performance of these high-performance rules-based control and most of these studies focus on the single-zone systems. In this Modelica-based simulation study, the high-performance rule-based control sequences from GDL36 were compared to the state-of-the-art intelligent controllers (i.e., optimization-based controller (OBC) and deep reinforcement-learning-based controller (DRLC)) in terms of the energy efficiency and thermal comfort. The performance evaluation was conducted in a medium-sized office building with a multi-zone Variable Air Volume (VAV) cooling system. The OBC and DRLC replaced the GDL36 airside supervisory level control loops. In other words, the optimal supply air temperature (SAT) and static differential pressure (DP) setpoints were determined by the optimization problems in OBC and trained control policy by DRLC. The OBC and DRLC were formulated to minimize the HVAC energy consumption and zone air temperature violation. The OBCs with different control intervals and DRLCs with different hyperparameters in the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm were exploited and fine-tuned. The simulation results show that the GDL36 has a comparable energy performance (within a 3% deviation) with DRLC in the cases with high or mild cooling loads. It also has a comparable energy performance (within a 3% deviation) with OBC in the case of a high cooling load. However, the case with GDL36 consumed 7% more energy in the testing shoulder period. For the thermal comfort metric, the GDL36 has slightly more zone air temperature violations in all testing scenarios compared to the two intelligent controllers. From this case study, we can conclude that the GDL36 has demonstrated its comparable performance in terms of energy efficiency and thermal comfort with the two intelligent controllers. The GDL36 airside SOO is good enough considering the complexity and tuning efforts of the intelligent controllers.",
