Residential buildings consume a significant amount of energy, emphasizing the importance of optimizing energy usage. Demand-side management (DSM) helps consumers and producers manage energy consumption through incentives and pricing. This study develops a new mathematical model to manage DSM in smart residential buildings. Extant literature commonly considers only a single objective function, ignores uncertainties, and applies only one price- or incentive-based program to load management in smart residential buildings. This study develops a multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model that applies both price- and incentive-based programs and considers uncertainties. The objectives are cost reduction, peak load minimization, user comfort improvement, and load factor maximization. This model can manage optimal schedules for household appliances and power exchange within buildings. The study shows that participating in the incentive-based program in a four-household residential complex yielded a 2 % decrease in electricity costs and a 1 % reduction in peak load while upholding comfort and load factor levels compared to non-participation. When extended to an eight-household complex, potential benefits include an 8.3 % decrease in electricity cost and a 2.6 % reduction in peak load, highlighting the program\u2019s effectiveness in residential energy management strategies.

Yet, in parallel, international initiatives like the United Nations Paris Agreement (2015) call for global carbon emissions reductions to as close to zero as possible (commonly referred to as \u2018net zero\u2019). This moves away from fossil fuels mandates ever greater use of electricity, and carbon emission reducing initiatives like smart residential buildings and electric vehicles in the two big sectors of energy demand in the developed world (transport and residential buildings) compound this urgent need for new ways of reducing energy demand. However, it is not just the demand side that causes the urgent need for new ideas and new thinking on energy management; proper planning is needed to maintain an equilibrium between supply and demand. The construction of power stations and electric power transmission systems have long life cycles and cannot respond to consumption led demand growth time frames. Governments worldwide have realized that energy management is not just about working with energy producers but must also involve working with consumers (e.g., households). Therefore, the term demand side management (DSM) emerged (Torriti, 2016). The focus of DSM is to manage energy use by consumers. DSM is a managerial program related to the planning, executing, and controlling of all activities that positively affect energy consumption (River, 2005). A subset of DSM, demand response (DR), refers to a set of actions to change the power consumption pattern to improve network reliability and prevent price increases, especially at peak hours. DR programs are divided into two main categories and several subgroups. The main two groups are incentive-based and price-based programs (Wang et al., 2021a). Incentive-based programs include direct load control (DLC), interruptible/ curtailable service (I/C), demand bidding/buy back (DB), emergency demand response program (EDRP), capacity market program (CAP), and ancillary service markets (A/S). Price-based programs consist of time-of-use (TOU), real-time pricing program (RTP), critical peak pricing (CPP), peak time rebate (PTR), and system peak response transmission tariff (SPRTT) (Aalami et al., 2008; Uddin et al., 2018). While incentive-based programs encourage consumers to reduce their consumption at peak consumption (peak load) by paying them a reward, in price-based programs, the electricity tariff changes proportionally to the cost of energy production at the time of consumption. Encouraging users to respond to the price is the main idea behind a price-based program. Therefore, consumers are encouraged to reduce their consumption in the peak load and shift it to other times (Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 2008). The EDRP, which is an incentive-based program, pays a reward to customers for reducing energy consumption in case of emergencies when the electrical grid is in its peak load. This program is a voluntary and optional program for the consumer. Note that some programs, such as I/C, DB, A/S, and CAP, are designed for major uses, such as industry (Albadi & El-Saadany, 2007). TOU program is one of the most common methods of DR programs, which provides new opportunities for power-incentive companies to save energy costs (Wu et al., 2019). TOU schemes are an effective means of reducing peak energy usage and increasing usage during off-peak times. This approach can help balance the power grid and promote using renewable energy sources (Wesseh & Lin, 2021). A TOU tariff divides a day into time slots and determines different prices for those time slots using different price levels: a lower price for the off-peak, an intermediary price for the mid-peak, and a higher price for on-peak slots usually are used. The time slots and prices are set beforehand and do not change, except possibly based on the seasons of the year (Anjos and Gomez, 2017). This method encourages customers to decrease their consumption by adjusting the price of electricity at different times of the day. RTP and CPP programs are also designed for high consumption. RTP program calculates the price of energy instantly, and the CPP program is run when the grid\u2019s reliability is in danger (Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 2008). Thus, the combination of incentive- and price-based programs is an idea through which electrical energy management can be effectively addressed. Implementing demand response programs in residential areas is an effective solution for managing electrical energy in smart homes. Numerous research efforts have been dedicated to the application of DR in the residential sector. For example, El-Afifi et al. (2024) introduced a load-shifting strategy for smart buildings. This strategy utilized a multi-objective hybrid optimization technique to minimize energy costs, CO2 emissions, and power demands. Kanakadhurga and Prabaharan (2024) presented a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model for energy management in smart homes. They analyzed the influence of energy prices and demand response strategies in a smart home equipped with a photovoltaic system, electric vehicle, and energy storage system. Wang et al. (2023) proposed an optimal multi-objective model for the DSM of a smart microgrid. They employed a stochastic scheduling approach to minimize operating costs, pollutant emissions, and shutdown costs. Additionally, the model sought to foster customer involvement through dynamic retail pricing. Tostado-Veliz et al. (2023) developed a MILP interval-based model to address the home energy management problem, considering the varying levels of uncertainty involved in home operations. As part of this approach, a lexicographic-interval formulation of the home energy management problem was presented. Salazar et al. (2023) suggested a dynamic customer demand management model based on real-time pricing and incentives using reinforcement learning. The proposed method enabled the optimization of energy consumption by implementing changes in electricity prices in real time and providing financial and non-financial incentives to customers. Liu et al. (2023) put forward a multi-objective optimal scheduling approach for household appliances using a hybrid heuristic algorithm. The research focused on DSM and aimed to optimize energy consumption, cost, and user preferences. Maurya and Nanda (2023) presented a time-varying multi-objective scheduling method for smart home appliances using the fuzzy adaptive dynamic algorithm. The study used artificial intelligence to optimize energy consumption, cost, and user convenience. Malehmirchegini and Farzaneh (2023) focused on modeling incentive-based demand response in the day-ahead wholesale electricity market in Japan. They considered the impact of customer satisfaction on social welfare and profitability, aiming to optimize electricity consumption in sustainable grids and save energy costs. Luo et al. (2023) provided a bi-level optimization method considering a real-time demand response strategy and price and incentive programs for consumers and energy suppliers. The proposed method involved optimal demand management, energy consumption, and support of renewable energy sources, resulting in cost reduction and improved network performance. An enhanced decentralized scheme according to incentive-based demand responses from residential customers was designed by Dewangan et al. (2023). The research focused on improving energy consumption behavior by offering incentives to residential customers in real time based on their energy demand patterns. The scheme aimed to optimize energy usage and promote more sustainable practices among residential consumers. Ghayour and Barforoushi (2022) focused on the optimal scheduling of electrical and thermal resources and appliances in a smart home under uncertainty. They developed a scheduling strategy that considered energy consumption and thermal comfort while accounting for uncertainties such as renewable energy availability and weather conditions. The proposed approach contributed to the efficient utilization of resources and the reduction of energy costs in smart homes. Dorahaki et al. (2022) presented a home energy management model considering energy storage and smart flexible appliances by adopting a modified time-driven prospect theory approach. They defined an algorithm based on analyzing consumers\u2019 experiences and preferences to predict and manage energy demand, enabling optimization of energy consumption at home by applying changes in electricity prices and temporal conditions. To plan an optimal time for using appliances, Tantawy et al. (2022) introduced a scheduling method for home appliances using hybrid energy sources and intelligent algorithms. The study aimed to improve energy efficiency and reduce household costs. Wang et al. (2021) designed a residential power DSM optimization model based on fine\u2011grained mixed frequency data. The results indicated that monetary incentives resulted in a statistically significant reduction in electricity use during peak periods in summer. Wu et al. (2019) proposed a time of using the price method. They planned optimized time for using appliances and designed an integer linear programming (ILP) model to reduce the cost of electrical energy in the building and improve the LF. Adelman and Uckun (2019) developed a methodology to compute price load equilibrium for large-scale smart homes considering dynamic electricity pricing. They concluded that dynamic pricing could reduce power bills and generation costs, and increase social welfare and consumer surplus. Faisal et al. (2019) utilized a combination of RTP and CPP for scheduling the using time of home appliances in a smart home. An energy management model was proposed to control the load in the residential sector. Molla et al. (2019) developed a multi-objective mathematical model to optimize the cost of energy consumption, peak load, and LF. The authors use TOU for planning an appropriate time for using household appliances in a smart home. Al Essa (2019) analyzed a single-objective mathematical model to reduce the cost of the consumer based on planning an optimal time for using thermostatic appliances. A battery was used to store the electrical energy and a photovoltaic (PV) as a scattered energy. Shakouri and Kazem (2017) designed a model to reduce household consumption costs and peak load. The best time for using household appliances was recommended by considering the electricity tariff at different times of the day. The authors proposed a multi-objective (MILP) to minimize both electrical peak load (EPL) and total electricity cost (TEC). The impact of electricity pricing strategies (peak pricing and flat pricing) on renewable energy investment and carbon emission was surveyed by Kok et al. (2016). The results showed that flat pricing motivated the utility firm to invest more in wind and solar energy sources, resulting in lower carbon emissions. On the other hand, peak pricing leads to a higher solar energy investment. Wang et al. (2015) utilized a single-objective model based on TOU. This model investigated the optimal power exchanged between different parts of the home. Tascikaraoglu et al. (2014) developed a method to manage a residential smart home. They proposed a MILP model that used communication technology in a smart home to reduce energy costs. Dehnad and Shakouri (2013) proposed a multi-objective MILP model to maintain consumer comfort when using appliances. Reduction of consumption costs and peak load were considered in this modeling. Table 1 presents a summary of the studies which are most related to this study. The last row of the tables shows the characteristics of our proposed model. Based upon our review of extant literature, previous research has customarily developed a single-objective mathematical model (Table 1) with the aim of cost minimization for load management in a smart building. However, our paper develops a multi-objective optimization model of load management, applied in a smart residential building based on DSM. In contrast to many previous studies that have utilized price-based programs, the present study employs a combined approach that integrates both price- and incentive-based programs. The use of renewable energy and energy storage systems are also considered. Moreover, in extant literature, most studies considered a deterministic setting, while in reality, some model parameters are uncertain. Hence, robust optimization is used for load management planning. Therefore, the main contributions of this study can be summarized as follows. - This study presents a mathematical model to characterize residential DSM within the framework of both price-based and incentive-based programs. This goes beyond the predominant price-based DSM approaches commonly employed. - In this model, different objectives are considered, namely electrical cost reduction, peak load minimization, user welfare improvement, and load factor maximization, which are subject to appliances scheduling, power exchange planning, and other system constraints. - Moreover, due to uncertainties in some parameters of the proposed model, robust optimization is employed for load management planning. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews system architecture. The problem definition and model design is explained in Section 3. The robust optimization and goal programming (GP) models are explained in Section 4. Section 5 explains data gathering. In Section 6, the results of running the models are shown, and finally, Section 7 discusses conclusions and future research directions. 2 System architecture A smart building is a residence where electronic and mechanical devices can be controlled through programmable controllers with a computer network. This technology, also often referred to as building automation, provides building users with security, convenience, and energy efficiency and reduces human workload (Schiefer, 2015; Abdel\u2011Basset et al., 2021). Whilst the primary focus of this study is on energy efficiency, the study also addresses convenience in terms of benefits to residential occupants. The overall system architecture is depicted in Fig. 1 . The predominant component is the smart building controller (SBC), which is responsible for managing the appliances inside the building as well as for deciding when to get electricity from the grid or storage system and when to feed household loads, store electricity in the storage system, or sell the electricity to the grid. To achieve the objectives of minimizing EPL, minimizing the electricity cost, improving user comfort, and maximizing the LF, the system is optimized based on TOU and EDRP programs, appliance specifications, and the information collected from consumer preferences. SBC can monitor and control appliances employing communication networks like wireless fidelity (WiFi), general packet radio service (GPRS), or long-term evolution (LTE). Building appliances are categorized into three classes based on their intrinsic characteristics: 1. Time-shiftable appliances (TSAs): TSAs are appliances such as dishwashers whose usage can be shifted to a different time. 2. Power-shiftable appliances (PSAs): PSAs consume electric energy in a specific range between their minimum and maximum power. Most rechargeable devices, such as water pumps, fall into this category. 3. Non-shiftable appliances (NSAs): NSAs, such as refrigerators, have fixed power consumption requirements and working periods; SBC considers their energy consumption according to consumer preferences. 3 Problem definition and model design In this study, the residential building provides the electricity needed from the power grid and a PV system as a source of renewable electricity. Battery storage is considered to increase the reliability of the solar energy system and reduce the cost of electricity consumption from the power grid. It is possible to sell electrical energy to the power grid according to the incentive DSM programs. The exchange of electrical components between different parts of the smart building can be seen in Fig. 2 (Wu et al., 2015). The definitions of E1 to E6 are: E1. Energy generation by solar panels for charging the battery. E2. Battery discharge for load demand. E3. Grid energy for charging the battery. E4. Grid energy for load demand. E5. Energy generation by solar panels for load demand. E6. Battery discharge for selling energy to the power grid. The load scheduling mechanism can be described as a multi-objective MILP model that includes sets, indices, functions, variables, and parameters provided on nomenclature. 3.1 The proposed mathematical model The proposed mathematical model is a multi-objective MILP model with four objective functions (Eqs. (1)-(4)) subject to the constraints (5)-(34). 3.1.1 Objective functions The objectives of the optimization problem are to minimize TEC, WTR, and EPL and maximize LF. One of the critical goals of load management is to minimize consumer costs. Eq. (1) is designed for this purpose (Wu et al., 2015). This equation depicts the total energy cost and contains three sections. The first section shows how much it costs to buy electricity from the power grid. On the contrary, the second section shows how much electricity is sold by households in peak load to the power grid. Finally, the last part calculates consumers\u2019 rewards for participating in EDRP. (1) Min F 1 = TEC = ∑ h = 1 24 { T buy ( h ) * E buy ( h ) − T sell ( h ) * E sell ( h ) − E _ EDRP ( h ) * Re ( h ) } Eq. (2) is designed to improve user comfort. This equation makes it possible to increase consumer comfort by minimizing the waiting time rate when using the TSAs (Cheng et al., 2013; Rastegar et al., 2012). In other words, the more S t a is closer to O T P S a , the more consumer comfort exists. WT R A v g is measured by a unit in the range of 0 to 1. The more WT R A v g is closer to zero, the more consumer use the appliances during the scheduled time. (2) Min F 2 = WT R AVg = ∑ a = 1 n ( S t a − OTP S a ) ∑ a = 1 n ( OTP E a − OTP S a − l a ) , ∀ a ∈ TSA Fig. 3 shows the start and the end time of TSAs and constraints (3)-(4) adjust them. (3) S t a = ∑ h = O T P S a O T P E a − l h * U a ( h ) , ∀ a ∈ T S A (4) ∑ h = OTP S a OTP E a − l U a ( h ) = 1 , ∀ U a ∈ { 0 , 1 } , ∀ a ∈ TSA Eq. (5) is designed to minimize EPL (Shakouri & Kazemi, 2017). (5) Min F 3 = EPL Eq. (6)Eq. (6) aims to maximize LF. LF is defined as the average load divided by the EPL in a specified time period. (6) Max F 4 = LF = AVG ( P buy ) = ∑ h = 1 24 E buy ( h ) 24 Max ( P buy ( h ) ) = EPL , h ∈ H It is well-known that a low LF indicates a high capital cost for the suppliers to provide the maximum required capacity. Therefore, F4 indeed considers consumers\u2019 social responsibility in reducing the total average electricity cost. A low LF implies that occasionally a high demand is set. To service that peak, capacity is sitting idle for long periods, thereby imposing higher costs on the system, which means higher electricity prices for consumers. 3.1.2 Model constraints EDRP constraint is depicted by Eq. (7). DR can expand customer participation in the electricity market and lead by changing its pattern from a reactive relation to an interactive relation. There are various methods to evaluate the successful implementation of the DR program, the most important of which is the determination of customer baseline load (CBL). CBL is the expected pattern of customer consumption in the absence of DR programs. Fig. 4 shows the manner of load reduction in CBL after implementing DR programs in the residential sector in the context of a smart grid. (7) E _ E D R P ( h ) = C B L ( h ) − E b u y ( h ) , ∀ h ∈ H Constraints (8)-(11) are used to model the need for electrical energy. Eq. (8) indicates the sum of the required energy for electrical appliances in the smart building. Constraint (9), as it is clear from Fig. 1, shows that the required energy has to be provided from three different sources: power grid, battery , and PV. Constraint (10) shows that EPL has to be more than the sum of bought power. Constraint (11) is set to make sure that the energy phases fulfill their energy requirements. (8) C ( h ) = ∑ a = 1 n C a ( h ) , ∀ h ∈ H (9) ∑ a = 1 n C a ( h ) = E 4 ( h ) + E 2 ( h ) + E 5 ( h ) (10) E b u y ( h ) ≤ E P L , ∀ h ∈ H (11) ∑ h = 1 24 C a ( h ) = D R a , ∀ a ∈ A Eq. (12), as indicated in Fig. 2, shows that the total energy has been provided from three different sources: power grid, battery, and PV. In fact, C a ( h ) indicated in Eq. (9) with the index of a, calculated the amount of energy used by each appliance in the time of h, while C ( h ) which is used in Eq. (12) calculates the amount of energy used in time h for all appliances, simultaneously (Wu et al., 2015). Constraint (13) shows produced energy by PV is either saved in the battery or consumed by appliances directly. Constraint (14) displays saved energy in the battery is either consumed in the building or sold to the power grid. Based on constraint (15), energy is bought from the power grid for two purposes: charging the battery and using appliances. Constraint (16) shows selling the energy to the power grid. Constraint (17) displays how the battery is charged from the PV or power grid sources. (12) C ( h ) = E 2 ( h ) + E 4 ( h ) + E 5 ( h ) , ∀ h ∈ H (13) E ( h ) = E 1 ( h ) + E 5 ( h ) (14) E d c h ( h ) = E 6 ( h ) + E 2 ( h ) (15) E b u y ( h ) = E 3 ( h ) + E 4 ( h ) (16) E s e l l ( h ) = E 6 ( h ) (17) E c h ( h ) = E 3 ( h ) + E 1 ( h ) Constraints (18)-(20) are used to model the TSAs power consumption, and constraints (21) and (22) are applied to model the PSAs and NSAs power consumption, respectively. A TSA power consumption can be presented as P a = [ p a 1 p a 2 ⋯ p a 24 ] T . The operation can be postponed, but the power consumption pattern should remain the same. Hence, the scheduling result C a ( h ) has to be exactly the same as one of the cyclic shifts of the pattern p a . All possible shifts can be put together in a matrix as in Eq. (19). E a t o t a l in Eq. (19) is a matrix that specifies the cyclic shifts of the TSAs pattern, which is based on consumer preferences. The binary integer vector U a = [ u a 1 u a 2 ⋯ u a 24 ] T is defined as switch control for the TSAs. There is only one non-zero element in the the vector U a , which is equal to one. Vector U a is an optimization parameter that chooses the appropriate column of P a t o t a l to optimize the energy consumption. Eq. (21) is related to PSAs. PSAs take their values in a range between their minimum and maximum power. Solving the model will specify when and how PSAs have to work during the day to resolve both the required energy for PSAs and optimize the study\u2019s goals. Eq. (22) is related to NSAs. These appliances have constant power consumption, which is indicated by E a * . This constraint shows that NSAs have to obtain as much electricity as they need at a specific time of the day. (18) C a ( h ) = U a * E a total , U ( h ) = [ U a ( 1 ) , U a ( 2 ) , ⋯ . U a ( 24 ) ] , ∀ a ∈ TSA (19) E a total = [ E a ( 1 ) E a ( 24 ) ⋯ E a ( 2 ) E a ( 2 ) E a ( 1 ) ⋯ E a ( 3 ) ⋮ ⋮ ⋯ ⋮ E a ( 24 ) E a ( 23 ) ⋯ E a ( 1 ) ] , ∀ a ∈ TSA (20) ∑ h = 1 24 U a ( h ) = 1 , ∀ U a ∈ { 0 , 1 } , ∀ a ∈ TSA (21) P a \u203e ≤ C a ( h ) ≤ P a \u203e , ∀ a ∈ PSA , ∀ h ∈ [ h a s , h a s + 1 , ⋯ . h a e ] (22) C a ( h ) ≥ E a * , ∀ a ∈ NSA , ∀ h ∈ [ h a s , h a s + 1 , ⋯ . h a e ] PV devices generate electricity directly from sunlight via an electronic process that occurs naturally in certain types of material, called semiconductors. Electrons in these materials are freed by solar energy and can be induced to travel through an electrical circuit, powering electrical devices or sending electricity to the grid (Schwingshackl et al., 2013; Mekhilef, 2012). According to Eq. (23), the output energy of the PV system is calculated based on constant coefficients η i n , η T r e f , and β T r e f , and parameters w i , I p v , and T a . The modeling of the PV is shown in constraints (23)-(25). (23) E s o l a r ( h ) = η T r e f [ 1 − β T r e f ( T a ( h ) + I p v ( h ) * e − 3.473 − 0.0594 * w i − T r e f ) ] * I p v ( h ) * A C (24) E p v ( h ) = η i n * E s o l a r ( h ) (25) E p v ( h ) = E 1 ( h ) + E 5 ( h ) A battery captures any unused solar power generated during the day, for later use at night, and on low-sunlight days (Wu et al., 2015; Moghaddam et al., 2016). Constraints (26)-(31) are used to model the battery storage system. (26) S O C ( h ) = S O C ( h − 1 ) + η c h * E c h ( h ) * Δ h − ( 1 η d c h ) * E d c h ( h ) * Δ h , h ≥ 1 (27) S O C \u203e ≤ S O C ( h ) ≤ S O C \u203e (28) 0 ≤ E c h ( h ) ≤ E c h \u203e * x ( h ) , x ( h ) = { 0 , 1 } (29) 0 ≤ E d c h ( h ) ≤ E d c h \u203e * y ( h ) , y ( h ) = { 0 , 1 } (30) x ( h ) + y ( h ) ≤ 1 (31) ∑ h = 1 24 η c h * E c h ( h ) * Δ h − ( 1 η d c h ) * E d c h ( h ) * Δ h = 0 The last category of constraints is related to the power grid. Power grid exchange constraints are shown in (32)-(34). Eq. (34) shows that at a specific time, it is possible to buy electricity from the power grid or sell electricity to it. However, it is not possible to sell and purchase electricity simultaneously. (32) 0 ≤ E s e l l ( h ) ≤ E s e l l \u203e * o ( h ) , o ( h ) = { 0 , 1 } (33) 0 ≤ E b u y ( h ) ≤ E b u y \u203e * n ( h ) , n ( h ) = { 0 , 1 } (34) o ( h ) + n ( h ) ≤ 1 4 Solution approach In the previous section, the problem was modeled when the parameters were certain. In deterministic mathematical programming, it is assumed that the parameters are definite, and the effects of data uncertainty are ignored on both optimality and feasibility. Data uncertainty is a common challenge in many optimization problems encountered in the real world. In this study, for example, it is impossible to estimate parameters such as wind speed and intensity of solar radiation precisely. Therefore, it is essential to design a model to be robust against such parameters. Different approaches have been used to optimize in case of uncertainty; in this research, a robust approach has been used. 4.1 Robust optimization The robust approach was proposed to solve optimization problems with data uncertainty in the early 1970s. This approach has recently been extensively used and developed (Bertsimas & Sim, 2004). Researchers have mentioned two reasons to use a robust optimization approach. Firstly, a robust approach is more straightforward than other approaches, especially when the model is solved. Secondly, to solve the robust models, precise knowledge of the probability distribution of uncertain parameters is not required (Alem et al., 2012). Instead, historical data and decision-maker experiences related to uncertain parameters can be utilized. In this study, the model proposed by Mulvey et al. (1995) was employed due to the scenario-based nature of the data. According to this model, the general form of the scenario-based optimization model of building load management problem is as follows: In objective function (1), C B L ( h ) and therefore E _ E EDRP ( h ) are uncertain parameters. Hence, ω ∑ s S P s ( δ S ) in the first objective function is a penalty for infeasibility, and it guarantees the robustness of the model. Therefore, the objective function (35) and the constraint (36) are defined. (35) Min F 1 = TEC = Min ∑ s = 1 S P s ( ∑ h = 1 24 { T buy ( h ) * E buy ( h ) − T sell ( h ) * E sell ( h ) − E _ EDRP ( h ) S * Re ( h ) } ) + λ ∑ s = 1 S p s ( θ s + + θ s − ) + ω ∑ s S ∑ h H P s ( δ S ( h ) ) (36) ∑ h = 1 24 { T buy ( h ) * E buy ( h ) − T sell ( h ) * E sell ( h ) − E _ EDRP ( h ) S * Re ( h ) } − ∑ s = 1 S P s ( ∑ h = 1 24 { T buy ( h ) * E buy ( h ) − T sell ( h ) * E sell ( h ) − E _ EDRP ( h ) S * Re ( h ) } ) − θ s + + θ s − = 0 where λ is the weight of risk and ω is used to derive a spectrum of answers that develop trade-off solutions for model robustness. ω is set experimentally by the decision-maker. The third part in (35) is the penalty function for infeasibility and ensures the robustness of the model. P s is the probability of scenario s. δ S ( h ) is the deviation variable that shows the amount of unsuccessful value of uncertainty parameter in scenario s. θ s + and θ s − are the linearization coefficients under scenario s. Moreover, the parameters of wind speed, intensity of solar radiation, and temperature are uncertain in the constraint (23). Therefore, the constraint has been modified as Eqs. (37) and (38). (37) E solar ( h ) = η Tref [ 1 − β Tref ( T a ( h ) S + I PV ( h ) S * e − 3.473 − 0.0594 * wi ( h ) S − Tref ) ] * I PV ( h ) S * AC , ∀ s ∈ S (38) E PV ( h ) + δ S ( h ) = { η in * η Tref [ 1 − β Tref ( T a ( h ) S + I PV ( h ) S * e − 3.473 − 0.0594 * wi ( h ) S − Tref ) ] * I PV ( h ) S * AC } , ∀ s ∈ S 4.2 Goal programming One of the multi-objective decision-making methods is goal programming (GP), which was introduced in the 1960s. This method is designed based on the minimization of deviation from the objective functions. When there are multi-objective models, the decision-makers usually cannot reach all their objectives. Therefore, they try to find a solution as close as possible to their objectives (Aliasghari et al., 2020; Crowder & Sposito, 1991). In GP, each measure is given a goal or target value to be achieved. In this paper, the GP method is employed to address the multi-objective model. The steps involved in solving the model are outlined as follows: The first objective function with all constraints is considered, and the model is run. The final answer on the basis of (39) is considered as T E C * which shows the optimal point of T E C . (39) Min F 1 = TEC Subj ect to all the cons trai nts The final answer on the basis of (40) is considered as W T R * which shows the optimal point of W T R . (40) Min F 2 = WTR Subj ect to all the cons trai nts Also, the final answers based on (41) and (42) are considered as E P L * and L F * which show the optimal values of EPL and LF respectively. (41) Min F 3 = EPL Subj ect to all the cons trai nts (42) Min F 4 = LF Subj ect to all the cons trai nts Finally, the GP model is solved based on (43). (43) M in G = ( d 1 + * 100 ) / TE C * + ( d 2 + * 100 ) / WT R * + ( d 3 + * 100 ) / EP L * + ( d 4 − * 100 ) / L F * subj ect to : TEC − d 1 + + d 1 − = TE C * WTR − d 2 + + d 2 − = WT R * EPL − d 3 + + d 3 − = EP L * LF − d 4 + + d 4 − = L F * all other model cons trai nts where d + and d + respectively indicate positive and negative deviations from the optimal point of the objective function, and G is the minimum total percentage of deviations from the goals (optimal point of the objective functions). It would be mentioned that the robust GP models are run by GAMS 25.3.0 /CPLEX solver, and subsequently, the results were exported to Excel for enhanced clarity and ease of interpretation. 5 Data gathering Different scenarios are required to be defined to implement Mulvey\u2019s robust method Mulvey et al. (1995). Since it is impossible to determine the exact amount of E PV in constraint (38), and E _ E D R P ( h ) in constraint (35) during a year, they are usually estimated based on previous years\u2019 reports. Therefore, the type of scenarios was based on the uncertain parameters of that study, and the probability of occurrence was based on the last five years\u2019 average. 1. First scenario: Working day, clean air with the probability of 0.4. 2. Second scenario: Working day, cloudy weather with a probability of 0.4. 3. Third scenario: Non-working day, clean air with the probability of 0.1. 4. Fourth scenario: Non-working day, cloudy weather with a probability of 0.1. These scenarios can be defined as Ω = {1, 2, 3, 4} and ∑ s = 1 4 P s = 1 . To validate the proposed model, the actual energy consumption data in residential buildings have been used as indicated in Tables 2-5 which shows the daily electricity use of four households in Tehran (the capital city of Iran). Planning for these buildings to optimize energy consumption for the next day is based on consumer preferences announced by consumers. Purchase and sale tariffs of energy are indicated in Tables 6 and 7 , respectively. These tariffs are based on the latest tariffs for building subscribers in 2021 in Tehran. In demand response program, participants are paid a reward in peak load hours as much as they decrease their load compared with CBL. The amount of reward when a participant takes part in the EDRP is 9.1 cents per kilowatt-hour. To incorporate the TOU mechanism in calculations of the final cost, the difference in off-peak, mid-peak, and peak hours is applied as follows. Based on the statistical data, peak hours occur from 8pm to 12am, while off-peak hours are between 2am and 10am. Any other time falls under the category of mid-peak hours. After calculating the cost of electricity based on Table 6, an extra cost for peak hours or discount for mid-peak and off-peak times is calculated as follows: (44) Disc ount for off − peak hours ( 2 am − 10 am ) = Elec tric ity cons umpt ion ( kWh ) × 0.43 ( Cent ) (45) Disc ount for mid − peak hours ( 12 am − 2 am , 10 am − 8 pm ) = Elec tric ity cons umpt ion ( kWh ) × 0.54 ( Cent ) (46) Extra cost for peak hours ( 8 pm − 12 am ) = Elec tric ity cons umpt ion ( kWh ) × 0.63 ( Cent ) Note that in Iran, the electricity price varies in different sectors, cities, and months. In this research, the electricity tariffs of the residential sector in Tehran in September 2021 are considered. To convert the official currency, Rial, into US dollars, an exchange rate of $1 = 220K-Rials was assumed. Other required data were collected from related organizations as below. - Ministry of Energy of Iran (2021): Tariffs and regulations for the sale of electricity. - Ministry of Energy of Iran (2021): Rewards of EDRP program and energy purchase tariffs. - Iran Meteorological Organization (2021): Air temperature, the intensity of solar radiation, and wind speed. The diagram illustrating the optimization procedures can be found in Fig. 5 . Assessment of the proposed methodology is based on the optimization and results provided in Section 6. 6 Optimization results In this section, first, the model is solved for each building separately (isolated buildings). Then, all buildings are considered as an apartment complex, and the results are compared with the optimization under isolated buildings to find out whether solving the model by considering all buildings as a complex can improve the results or not. After that, the model is solved for the apartment complex without participating in EDRP to indicate how incentive-based programs can affect the consumers in a complex to decrease their energy consumption. In addition, to address a more realistic scenario, the model is also solved in another case, where only two households participate in the EDRP program, and the results are compared with the previous scenario. 6.1 Optimization under isolated buildings The model was run for each building separately. Each of the four households participates in the EDRP. Fig. 6 shows the optimal schedule for using household electrical appliances at different times of the day in each building. This scheduling indicates how DSM manages the energy consumption of PSA and TSA. TSAs such as dishwashers and washing machines are delayed to off-peak hours to decrease consumption costs. PSAs such as water pumps and electric vehicles also charge in the off-peak hours when electricity costs are low. It leads to a decrease in both EPL and TEC. TSA and PSA have definite advantages for decreasing TEC and EPL. It is worth noting that if a PSA is also considered a TSA for a consumer, it can be included in F2. In the current study, it was assumed that the electric vehicle of household 1 is not a TSA. Nevertheless, the results show that it is being charged during the night (from 2pm to 3pm), which is the most convenient time for the consumer. Power exchange between different parts of the buildings is shown in Fig. 7 . The PV power is used when the output of PV is sufficient to fulfill the energy requirements of appliances. The energy stored in the battery is used during the peak load period to respond to load demand. If the energy stored in the battery exceeds the building\u2019s energy demand, the excess energy will be sold to the grid. During off-peak periods, the battery is primarily charged from the power grid. If the load demand is smaller than the PV output, the excess energy will be stored in the battery. Table 8 displays the results of the model solved using the GP method. TEC, EPL, LF, and consumers\u2019 comfort have improved due to choosing a proper schedule for utilizing TSAs and PSAs. 6.2 Optimization results for an apartment complex The model was run for all buildings as an apartment complex and considered EDRP for all buildings. Table 9 shows the results. As seen, TEC, WTR, EPL, and LF would be 23 cents, 0.135, 5.08 kW, and 91% in the best possible way. The last line in Table 9 shows the result of solving the model for four households as an apartment complex using the GP method. Results show that GP lets us manage the energy for each building appropriately. For example, although TEC in the first line in Table 9 decreased to 23 cents in the best situation, EPL deviated from its optimal point and reached 10 kW. In this situation, TEC is 31 cents, WTR is 0.135, EPL is 5.09 kW, and LF is 72 %. Fig. 8 shows the energy purchase status from the power grid at different times of the day for using electrical appliances in the apartment complex, depending on various goals. Moreover, Fig. 9 shows the total energy needed to use electrical appliances in the apartment complex at different times of the day. The difference between energy purchase status from the electrical grid in Fig. 8 and electrical appliance consumption in Fig. 9 is provided by either the energy stored in the battery or directly by the solar energy system. It shows that in this model, not only the time for using electrical appliances in the smart building is planned, but also power exchange between different components is carefully considered. The optimization result reveals that when the model is solved for buildings in an apartment complex, the cost is 31.0 cents. In contrast, TEC of isolated buildings equals 32.2 cents. In fact, when the model is run for building an apartment complex, costs decrease by about 3.7 %. Therefore, if the model is solved for residential buildings with more households, it is possible to expect better results for consumers. Comparison between optimization under isolated buildings and the apartment complex indicates that other goals will also improve when the model runs in an apartment complex instead of a building. EPL decreased from 7.07 kW to 5.09 kW (Both at 4am), indicating a 28 % reduction. WTR improved by 3.6 %. LF also increased from 67 % in isolated buildings to 72 % in the apartment complex, showing a 7.5 % improvement. It would be mentioned that 20 percent of the electricity needed for the apartment complex is provided by battery and PV. 14 kWh by battery and 6 kWh by PV from 100 kWh required in the apartment complex during the day. Table 10 indicates the optimization results under isolated buildings and the apartment complex. 6.3 Optimization results for the apartment complex without participating in the incentive-based program This section solves the model by considering all buildings as an apartment complex without participation in EDRP. EDRP is a program that households can participate voluntarily. The model results are compared with and without participation in EDRP to clarify the effects of participation in this program. As can be seen from Table 11 , costs decrease due to participation in the EDRP. Fig. 10 shows the amount of energy consumers need at different times of the day. It also shows how this amount of energy is provided from different sources, including the power grid, PV system, and storage system, with and without participating in EDRP. According to Fig. 11 , the maximum peak load with and without participating in EDRP is 5.1 and 5.13 kW, respectively. The minimum amount is zero because the battery or solar panels provide the entire required energy for the building at this time of the day. No energy is purchased by the apartment complex that participates in EDRP at peak hours (between 20 and 24 o\u2019clock). All energy necessary for the building is provided by the energy stored in the battery. Consumers who are unwilling to participate in EDRP provide their energy from the power grid at the peak load. It increases consumer costs. Moreover, this may make it difficult for producers to supply energy on a large scale. Therefore, participating in EDRP during peak hours can benefit both consumers and producers. In addition to decreasing consumers\u2019 costs, the EDRP causes producers to impose less pressure on power grids in peak load times. Fig. 11 shows the consumer load curve before and after running the program at different day hours. As it is clear from the figure, the consumers have decreased their consumption voluntarily at peak load after participating in the EDRP. According to the results, consumers can reduce their costs by about 2 % while participating in EDRP, which is a voluntary and optional program. It is worth mentioning that these results are based on the same level of consumer comfort and LF. Also, based on the outcomes, EPL decreases from 5.13 kW to about 5.10 kW in this program, which is about a 1 % improvement. This measure can be significant on a big scale. Comparison between the three settings indicates that objective functions will considerably be improved when the model is run for the apartment complex while consumers participate in EDRP. 6.4 Optimization results for the participation of two households in the EDRP program In this section, the model assumes an apartment complex where only two households participate in EDRP, as some households may not be interested in participating. In Table 12 , the results of models with varying participation levels are compared. The model implementation results demonstrate that even if only two households participate in the EDRP program, an improvement in TEC and EPL is observed compared to the scenario where households do not participate in this program. This improvement amounts to a 1.3 % reduction in TEC and a 0.4 % decrease in EPL. Comparing these findings with previous results shows that the incentive-based program improves objective functions, specifically decreasing TEC and EPL, while WTR and LF remain unchanged. The model was also run for an apartment complex with eight households when all households participated in EDRP to see how the results would differ with an increase in the number of households. The findings indicated an 8.3 % improvement in TEC and 2.6 % in EPL, while WTR and LF remained unchanged. Upon comparing the results with Table 11, it is evident that optimizing the model for eight households results in a more significant improvement in the objective functions than optimizing for four households, as it introduces room for more flexibility in the system. This finding underscores the importance of expanding the scope of the optimization process to achieve better outcomes. 7 Conclusions and future work In light of global energy use, shifting from fossil-based energy to less emission producing electricity led to energy consumption, consumer products, and consumer behavior must change, as well as energy providers\u2019 activities. In the developed world, the two most energy hungry sectors are residential houses and transport (dominated by road transport, i.e., cars). Smart Residential buildings (and electric vehicles) are core to this move to low or zero emission electricity based economies. This study directly addresses the urgent need for new thinking about residential consumer energy management, proposing promising and resilient applications that take into account the costs of producing energy. Literature review shows that the previous research mainly developed a single-objective model, ignored uncertainties, and applied only one price- or incentive-based program to load management in smart residential buildings. In this paper, a multi-objective MILP model was developed that applies both price- and incentive-based programs and considers uncertainties. In this way, TOU from price-based, and EDRP from incentive-based programs were applied. The various objectives consist of TEC, EPL minimization, user comfort improvement, and LF maximization, and due to the uncertainties in some parameters of the proposed model, robust optimization was used for load management planning. This model can manage the optimal schedules for using household appliances and power exchange between different parts of a building simultaneously. The day-ahead scheduling model was formulated to optimize the objective functions. Moreover, using renewable resources such as solar energy and instruments like a battery in modeling a smart building made reaching the goals more manageable. Using a battery made it possible to manage power exchange. The battery also reduced peak load by providing some parts of the electrical energy needed during peak hours. The output of this model provided the starting time of electrical appliances as well as the power exchange status in the smart buildings. The proposed model was assessed for discrete buildings, as well as a building as an integrated apartment complex, with and without households\u2019 participation in the EDRP program. Optimization under the apartment complex with households participation in the EDRP program led to the best results. The research findings indicated that participation in the EDRP within a residential complex consisting of four households resulted in a 2 % reduction in TEC compared to non-participation. Furthermore, there was a 1 % increase in EPL reduction while maintaining existing levels of comfort and LF. Upon application of the model to a residential complex consisting of eight households, the analysis revealed the potential for substantial benefits at a broader scale. Specifically, an 8.3 % enhancement in TEC and a 2.6 % improvement in EPL were observed, while WTR and LF remained unaltered. Surely, the relationship between the number of households and these enhancements is not a linear one and it tends to a saturation. However, the results underscore the effectiveness of integrating price- and incentive-based initiatives in residential DSM strategies. According to the model results, policymakers are advised to involve customers in simultaneous incentive- and price-based programs for DSM. It is recommended for future research to examine the effect of other demand response programs such as DLC or CPP. It is also possible to consider other factors, such as shifting working hours, which can affect CBL directly in managing energy consumption. Another direction for future research to develop the model is to consider consumer preferences when using appliances by employing fuzzy logic. Finally, the addition of other equipment, such as combined heat and power (CHP), thermal energy storage, and electric heat pumps can also help create a practical and realistic approach to modeling energy use in a smart buildings.

        "dc:description": "Residential buildings consume a significant amount of energy, emphasizing the importance of optimizing energy usage. Demand-side management (DSM) helps consumers and producers manage energy consumption through incentives and pricing. This study develops a new mathematical model to manage DSM in smart residential buildings. Extant literature commonly considers only a single objective function, ignores uncertainties, and applies only one price- or incentive-based program to load management in smart residential buildings. This study develops a multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model that applies both price- and incentive-based programs and considers uncertainties. The objectives are cost reduction, peak load minimization, user comfort improvement, and load factor maximization. This model can manage optimal schedules for household appliances and power exchange within buildings. The study shows that participating in the incentive-based program in a four-household residential complex yielded a 2 % decrease in electricity costs and a 1 % reduction in peak load while upholding comfort and load factor levels compared to non-participation. When extended to an eight-household complex, potential benefits include an 8.3 % decrease in electricity cost and a 2.6 % reduction in peak load, highlighting the program\u2019s effectiveness in residential energy management strategies.",
