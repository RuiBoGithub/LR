The exploration of the thermal energy storage potential of building thermal mass is an important and economic means to increase the flexibility of energy use in buildings. Feasible ways to increase the flexibility characteristic, however, are still rare. In this study, the energy consumption and thermal performance of a building with a novel ventilated electric heating floor were investigated through a simplified thermal network model, which was validated by on-site measurement. Aimed at analyzing the performance of the building in different energy systems, multi-energy sources were assumed to supply power to the heating system, including a common power grid and an independent residential wind turbine. The impact of five parameters was simulated, including the floor thickness, the diameter and the distance of air ducts, the ventilation mode and the ventilation rate. To reduce the number of simulated cases, the orthogonal testing method was adopted. Based on the goal of reducing energy consumption from the power grid, increasing consuming wind power and improving thermal comfort, the best structural parameters of the floor were obtained. In traditional systems, it is found out that the ventilated floor with these structural parameters can maximally reduce the heating energy consumption by 46.3% when the fan is on throughout the period. In the hybrid energy system, the consumption of energy in the power grid is also reduced, but the wind power consumption is not increased with the ventilation rate under the set operational rules. The thermal comfort, however, is significantly improved by ventilation.

As essential equipment in the renewable energy system, the energy storage amenities in buildings can mitigate the intermittent and unstable characteristics of renewable energy [2], to which different technologies have been successfully applied. Among them, thermal energy storage (TES) in residential buildings is proved to exhibit controllable energy storage and management capacity due to the large proportion of thermal energy demand in buildings, especially those with a regional even national level [3]. The characteristics of various TESs in buildings are different from the perspective of initial investment, operational cost and places occupied. Compared with other TES techniques that have been studied in various studies, structural building mass is a cheap but promising means to store the surplus renewable energy by power to heat (P2H), which could improve the overall operational flexibility of energy systems and assist in stabilizing the operation of power systems through demand response (DR) [4]. Furthermore, with the improvement of building thermal mass and thermal insulation aimed at increasing energy efficiency and reducing carbon emissions, the thermal storage capacity of building structural mass has been increased significantly [5]. It is estimated that the total building thermal mass in Denmark could be used to maximally shift electricity load of 34.1GWh [6]. For building heating systems using thermal mass, namely thermally active building system (TABS), it was proved that the total and peak energy consumption was reduced [7\u20139]. Nevertheless, compared to fan coils and radiators, the large thermal inertia of TABSs will reduce the flexibility of operation and energy management [10,11], even causing overheating issues [12]. A growing number of researches are focused on the combination of both radiant TABSs and convective air-conditioning systems. Li et al. [13] established a series of models, in which building structures and HVAC were used to reduce peak electricity load. It was found out that about 16.74% of peak load could be further reduced by convention on the basis of the contribution of building mass. Kim et al. [14] compared the operating cost and energy shifting potential of two units, namely convective cooling and TABS cooling. It was found out that a TABS was more effective in reducing the total energy consumption because of the large thermal capacity, whereas convective unit was more superior in reducing energy cost in DR stage because of the fast response. In these studies, a hollow core slab was installed in ceilings or walls, where heat loss is larger than that of floor due to the direct contact with outdoor environment and the effect of thermal bridge if it is used for thermal storage [15,16]. Ekrami et al. [17] simulated the impact of air velocity in channels on heat transfer rate inside the hollow core slab used for floor heating. The authors found out that for the single slab, the outlet air temperature could be increased by increasing air velocity. However, the authors also suggested on the optimization of the air velocity in the slab by integrating all the building components as an integrated system, including energy source and space air. Kayaci [18] simulated the energy performance of a heat pump energy supply system with a domestic ground source, and it was found out that when the space heating terminals were heating floor and fan coil, the annual coefficient of performance would be 3.37, which was better than that of the combination of radiator and fan coil. Chen [19] established a numerical model to simulate the thermal performance of a ventilated concrete slab in a solar house, where the slab was used to store the solar heat. Results showed that both the heating source and the air rate would affect the thermal storage capacity. The authors also suggested on the determination of the optimal structural parameters based on the results of an experiment or a simulation with a long-term consecutive period. In conclusion, it can be found out that air velocity, the thickness of floor layer, the size and length of air duct, and inlet air temperature are decisive factors of the outlet air and surface temperature of the ventilated TABSs. Regarding the impact of different structural and operational parameters of ventilated TABSs on energy storage performance and thermal comfort, however, studies related to energy shifting and space heating performance of the entire building are limited [20,21]. To help design energy flexible buildings that are equipped with ventilated TABS, a valid parametric analysis is necessary. The significant influencing factors and their positive or negative effects on energy and thermal performance, can thus be obtained. The impact of parameters is directly analyzed in some studies. Zhang et al. [22] simulated the impact of airspeed and layer thickness on the thermal insulation performance of a ventilated wall through a finite-difference model, who found out that an evaluation index was not determined by a single influencing factor, and the dominant influencing factor should be grasped. Besides, when the parameters studied and the level of each parameter increase, it is hard to get prominent conclusions. Orthogonal experiment is a useful method to reduce the number of test cases, which takes less time to obtain an optimal level group through variance analyses [23]. Li et al. [24] conducted an orthogonal test to find the optimal strategy of building retrofitting, and both the important factors and the best solution were achieved based on the goal of reducing annual energy cost. Zhu et al. [25] found an optimal building envelope to reduce the carbon emission through orthogonal method, which is very promising for obtaining the influencing rules of the design parameters of the ventilated TABSs, and can be used in the design process. From the literature review, it can be found out that there is a significant knowledge gap among the design principles of ventilated TABS with floor concerning the thermal comfort and energy consumption performance, which is caused by insufficient studies on the influence of key parameters from the perspective of the whole building, together with the lack of effective and reliable analytical tools. In this study, a simplified thermal model for a prototype building integrated with the ventilated floor was proposed and validated, which was then used for parametric and scenario analyses. The main novelty and contribution of this study is to explore the thermal control and energy flexibility traits of the novel ventilated heating floor, namely, the load shifting potential and thermal comfort performance. Specifically, the heating system is assumed to be applied to two different energy supply systems: one is a conventional power grid, the other is the combination of a detached wind turbine and a power grid, representing a demand response scenario. In this way, the optimal structural parameters for different energy systems can be obtained and used to guide the design and operation of such a building with ventilated heating floor. The reliable model can also be easily integrated into different kinds of residential buildings and energy systems, which can be used for further model predictive control to increase the overall efficiency of buildings and energy systems. 2 Methodology 2.1 System description Based on the previous study, the space heating rate and energy storage/extraction flexibility can be significantly modified through the ventilated floor [26,27]. In this study, the thermal and energy performance of the building with the ventilated floor under the impact of actual environmental factors and indoor thermal disturbance was investigated. To explore the energy storage potential of the building mass in both conventional energy systems and energy systems with a high proportion of renewable energy, two energy supply systems were proposed, as is shown in Fig. 1 . Specifically, the second system was a hybrid energy system including the a power grid and a residential wind turbine. The power output characteristic of the wind turbine used in this study is shown in Table .1 , whose start-up and rated wind speed are 2.0 m/s and 6.0 m/s, respectively. Both the energy from the residential wind turbine and the power grid can be used by the inverter to drive the heating system. In this system, most energy was consumed by the heating film, and should be analyzed in the first place. The state of the fan was affected by many factors including the resistance of air duct and the control rules. In this ventilation system, the characteristic of air duct was constant, and once the airspeed was set, the state of the fan would be only affected by the control signals. To simplify the control rules, the fan of the floor was assumed to be solely powered by the power grid, therefore, it would not be affected by the output of renewable energy. The prototype of the test cell is shown in Fig. 1, and the details of the ventilation system including the structure and the internal airflow pattern of the floor are also illustrated. Under ventilation mode, the inner space air was driven by a fan to flow through the air ducts built on the floor, and the heat source was electrothermal films beneath the floor. Sized 5.0 m × 3.5 m × 2.7 m (L × W × H), the enclosed space was assembled with a 2.7 m2 window in the south wall, and all the walls and roof are directly affected by the ambient environment. The physical parameters of materials and the structure of the test cell are listed in Table 2 , where the material layers of each structure were arranged from inside to outside, and the convective as well as the radiant heat transfer coefficients of each part were adopted from EN ISO 6946 : 2017 [28]. All the facades of the test cell satisfied the requirements of standard JGJ 26\u20132018, and the details of each structure are given due to that the thermal capacity of lumped nodes in the thermal network should be grasped. The total human thermal load was 116.4W (two people), and the heat output of lamp as well as equipment per area was set as 6W/m2 and 5W/m2, respectively. The two indoor thermal disturbances took effect from 19 : 00 to 8 : 00 on the next day. An electrothermal film with a rated power of 1.4 kW was placed beneath the floor mass to heat the room. The rated power of the fan was 250W, which was assumed not to change with the airspeed. 2.2 Model establishment 2.2.1 Thermal network model The thermal network of the building integrated with ventilated electric heating floor is shown in Fig. 2 , which was used for the simulation of building thermal dynamics and energy consumption in this research. The core of the simplified thermal network model (the part of ventilated floor) has been experimentally validated by authors in Refs. [26,29], however, some modifications should be made before this model is applied to real buildings. In this research, the previous model was improved, whose details are listed below: \u2022 To simplify the modeling process, the indoor convective heat transfer coefficients were modified based on the actual indoor environment as is recommended in BS EN ISO 52016\u20131 : 2017 [30] and EN ISO 6946 : 2017. \u2022 A real meteorological condition was considered. The ambient air temperature, solar radiation and internal disturbances including domestic amenities as well as people were added to the model. Besides, the links between the thermal disturbances and the temperature nodes in the thermal network model were fully considered, for example, the interaction between solar radiation and internal wall surfaces. For each temperature node, the basic heat balance equation was followed, and all the conductive, radiative as well as convective heat transfer among nodes was shown in Fig. 2. All the thermal capacities and resistances were obtained by the basic heat transfer formula ( R = ∑ δ λ A or R = 1 h A , C = ∑ρcV) and material properties. Q e is the heating power of the electrothermal film, and Q ig is the internal heat gain including human and domestic electric applications. Considering that Q ig enters the room mainly through convection, thus, it directly affects the indoor air temperature [31,32]. Both solar radiation and air temperature have impacts on the external surface, therefore, the composite outdoor temperature (T sa ) was used, as is shown in Eq. (1), where α w,o is the absorption coefficient of external walls which is set to 0.73, and Q r refers to the solar radiation. (1) T s a = T a m b + α w , o Q r h w , o + h r w , o The solar radiation through the window is directly absorbed by the indoor air and the wall surface [31,32]. The solar radiation through the window is directly absorbed by the indoor air and the wall surface [31,32]. In BS EN 52016\u20131 : 2017 [30], the part of solar heat flowing into the room air is defined by a factor \u201cconvective fraction\u201d, whose value is set to 10%. The solar heat absorbed by each internal surface is in proportion to the ratio of the wall area to the total area, thus, the proportion among Q r,1, Q r,2 and Q r,3 in Fig. 2 was obtained based on the area of each surface. Under ventilation mode, the outlet air temperature of ventilated floor was calculated through NTU model, and the effect of forced ventilation on space air was calculated based on an energy balance equation. The formulas of the thermal network model in Fig. 2 are summarized in Table .3 . 2.2.2 Thermal comfort evaluation In the demand response scenario in this study, the set-point of air temperature as well as the state of ventilation are changed for the need of increasing or reducing the energy demand, resulting in the change of thermal environment and thermal comfort. The index, predicted mean vote (PMV), which focuses on the impact of thermal load (TL) of the occupant on the thermal comfort, has been widely adopted to evaluate the indoor thermal comfort in international and national standards [33]. It has also been used for the evaluation of the thermal environment in demand response scenario [34,35], and the control of the heating system [36,37]. The PMV index was obtained through Eqs. (2)\u2013(8). In Eqs. (3) and (5), T s and MRT was calculated by the thermal network model; the metabolic rate (M) and movement mechanical power (Wp) were set to 58.2W/m2 and 0, respectively, representing the sedentary state of occupants; the clothing insulation (I cl ) was set to 0.217 m2 ⋅K/W denoting a typical winter clothing style [38], thus, the clothing area factor (f cl ) was determined by Eq. (6). The mean relative humidity (ϕ) was set to 40% referring to Ref. [39] and as a constant due to that no wet source exists in the heating system nor the building. Therefore, the water vapor pressure in air (P a ) can be obtained by Eq. (4). The mean air velocity in the room (v a ) was obtained by Eq. (7), which was based on the conservation law of mass, as well as the physical parameters of the test cell. Furthermore, due to the low airspeed in the simulated cases, Eq. (8) was used to calculate the convective heat transfer coefficient of body surface (h c ).

In ASHRAE 55 and GB/T 50785\u20132012, the PMV value is recommended to be within − 0.5 , 0.5 for satisfying the thermal comfort in residential buildings. On the other hand, considering residents are not in the room continuously (due to the set living period in Section 2.1), thus, the index, R comfort, level1 as shown in Eq. (9), which is the ratio between the time of indoor PMV falls into the recommended range when the occupants present in the room and the total time of occupants spend indoor, was proposed in this study to compared the thermal performance of the heating system. Meanwhile, in consideration of the indoor thermal stability are sacrificed in the DR scenario, the time when PMV is within the minimum acceptable PMV range ( − 1 , 1 ) recommended in GB/T50785-2012 was also counted, and the index R comfort, level2 was obtained through Eq. (10).

The participation rate was defined as the ratio between the accumulated active time of heating film in the downward demand response (DDR) or the upward demand response (UDR) events and the time of DDR or UDR in total, as shown in Eqs. (14) and (13). The two indexes were different due to the aim of the two events: in DDR events, energy consumption of the system should reduce, whereas in UDR events, the thermal mass should be charged with heat to store wind power.

The experimental parameters are detailed in Table 4 . The recommended outlet airspeed of underfloor air supply system should be less than 2 m/s [41], as a result, four velocities of outlet airspeed were set and three ventilation modes were proposed. Under Mode 1, the fan was on when the heating film was power-off, whereas was off when the heating source was on. Under Mode 2, the fan was operated throughout the simulation period. It is worth noting that 243 cases in total need to be simulated. To reduce the workload meanwhile ensuring accuracy, the orthogonal experiment method was adopted. Orthogonal tests are widely used in the design of experiments with multiple factors. Representative experimental conditions are picked out from all experiments by constructing an orthogonal table. By the full use of the orthogonality, the cases selected are evenly dispersed and neatly comparable, and by analyzing the results of those cases through the method of variance analysis and range analysis, the characteristics of the entire experiment can be grasped. The details of the design principle, the characteristics and the mechanism can be found out in Ref. [42,43], which is beyond the scope of this study. The orthogonal test is a mature experimental design method, and there are many reliable tools as well as commercial software, i.e., SPSS. Meanwhile considering that the state of ventilation was a prerequisite for the change of ventilation rate, orthogonal experiments under non-ventilation mode and two ventilation modes were designed separately. Two orthogonal experiment tables L 9 (33) and L 16 (3341) respectively under non-ventilation state and ventilation state were designed by SPSS [44], as is shown in Table s 5 and 6 . After simulation, a marginal mean value analysis and a variance analysis were implemented to compare the impact range and the importance of different parameters. The marginal mean value reflects the impact range of a single factor, while the variance analysis can be used to recognize the significance of factors through F test. Traditionally, a F test for a factor is conducted by comparing the mean square within a group (mean square error, MS E ) and that among groups (mean square of treatment, MS A ), as is shown in Eq. (15), where the mean square is obtained by the sum of squares (SS) and the degree of freedom (df), k is the number of groups, n i is the number of samples in group i, and N is the total number of samples. If the F value of a factor is higher than that of F 0.05 (df A , df E ), it can be regarded as a significant impact factor. The details of variance analysis can be easily found out in more specialized publications, like Ref. [45]. (15) F = M S E M S A = S S A / d f A S S E / d f E = ∑ i = 1 k n i ( X ¯ i − X ¯ ) 2 / ( k − 1 ) ∑ i = 1 k ∑ j = 1 n ( X i j − X ¯ ) 2 − ∑ i = 1 k n i ( X ¯ i − X ¯ ) 2 / ( N − k ) The simulation period was one month from January 1st to 31st, and the initial temperature of all nodes in the model was set at 15 °C. The weather profile including the wind speed profile was obtained from Meteonorm software [46], as is shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 , where the total solar radiation was the sum of direct and diffuse solar radiation, and the wind speed profile was used to simulate the wind power output. 2.4.2 The control strategy A rule-based demand response control strategy was proposed as is shown in Fig. 5 , which is different in each energy system. In the traditional energy system, a conventional temperature-based control strategy was used, and the system was driven by the power grid. The indoor air temperature was set at 21 °C. In the hybrid energy system, the heating system was driven by a hybrid energy system as is explained in system description. To some extent, the control strategy in this system is similar to an incentive-based demand response program. The operation of heating system was dispatched according to the output of wind turbine and the current state of heating system. In upward DR Stage 1 (UDR1) when the ambient wind speed was within 2 m/s to 6 m/s, the heating film was on until the upper set temperature (24 °C) was reached, and the ventilation system followed the set ventilation mode. It should be noticed that a certain amount of energy in the power grid was used in this scenario due to the system, however, this was inevitable so as to maximally use the wind power. In upward DR Stage 2 (UDR2) where the wind speed was higher than 6 m/s, the same heating strategy as that in the former period was applied, while the fan was off to increase the utilization of wind power. In downward DR (DDR) when the wind speed was lower than 2 m/s, the heating system was used to maintain the room temperature at around the minimum set temperature (18 °C), and the fan was on only when the film was turned on, which could shorten the heating time. The three stages are defined in Fig. 4 based on the wind speed. 2.5 Model validation In this study, a ventilated heating floor with the same structure as is illustrated in Section 2 was built in a separated test room in a nearly zero-energy building (NZEB) in Changchun, China, the information of which can be found in Ref. [47]. Through a comprehensive consideration of the structural strength and the convenience of the project, the ventilated floor with the structural parameters listed in Table .7 was constructed. Regarding the materials, the floor was made up of common cement mortar, and the ratio of cement, sand and water is also listed in Table .7. The power of the heating film was 1400W, and the outlet airspeed was set as 4 m/s. Notably, the envelopes of the physical test room were not the same as those in Section 2.1, thus, the parameters in the model were modified accordingly before model validation. The physical test room were not used for parametric analyses in this study due to the envelopes of the room are not representative of an actual building \u2013 only one envelope of the room was faced with the ambient, which was also the exterior wall of the NZEB, while the other four facades of the test room (excluding the floor) were the interior walls and floor slabs of NZEB, as well as two light steel keel gypsum boards were used to separate the test room. Furthermore, neither of the floor design and the operational strategy of this room was optimal because the parametric study was not conducted. A space heating test was conducted from February 12th to 16th in 2020. The operation of the heating film was controlled by a PID controller which monitored the space air temperature, whose lower and upper limit was 21 °C and 25 °C. The fan was on throughout the measurement. The key thermal parameters including the space air temperature (T s ) and floor temperature (T f ) were monitored by Pt1000 thermal resistance sensors, whose accuracy was 0.02 °C. All the data was recorded by Agilent DAQ970A data logger, and the sampling time was 1min. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Model validation Fig. 6 shows T u and T s of on-site measurement and simulation. When conducting model validation, parameters of the model were modified according to the information of this test room, and the index mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) was used to evaluate the results. The MAPE of T u and T s are 3.3% and 3.8%, respectively. In similar studies of the white-box thermal network model, the MAPE is found to falls in the range of 2.24% [48] to 4.3% [49], thus the results of the proposed model are relatively reasonable. At the same time, it can be found out that the deviation between simulated and experimental results at high noon and the night is relatively large, which might be caused by the air flow pattern of the fan and the impact of strong solar radiation. 3.2 Energy consumption characteristic 3.2.1 Energy consumption in a power grid Fig. 7 and Fig. 8 show the influencing rules of different factors on the power consumption of electrothermal film (E h ) in the normal heating scenario with the power grid as the energy source. In this scenario, the main focus is to reduce the energy demand, and the impact of structural parameters (A, B, and C, as well as their meaning can be found in Table .4) on energy demand will be first analyzed. Under non-ventilation mode, in Appendix A., it can be found out that the thickness of floor is the only significant factor that affects E h . When the thickness is 20 cm, the marginal mean E h is 296.8 kWh, which is 14.2 kWh higher than the 10 cm floor. Although the difference is not as large as the totally consumed energy, it indicates that the floor thickness should be reduced for normal heating purposes, which is also proved by other researchers [50]. When ventilation is on, the thickness of floor is no longer a significant factor, whereas both the other two structural factors directly influencing the ventilation are significant impact factors, as is shown in Appendix B. It can be observed that the marginal mean value of E h decreases with the increase of air duct diameter, while increases with the distance of air ducts. Through this phenomenon, it is obvious that a larger air duct diameter and a larger number of air ducts lead to a higher space heating rate, thus reducing the operation time of the electrothermal film. Meanwhile, the marginal mean value of E h under ventilation mode of all factors is also remarkably lower than that under non-ventilation mode, which shows that energy demand can be reduce by ventilation. For example, the mean E h of floor with a thickness of 20 cm in ventilation mode is about 27.2% lower than that under non-ventilation mode. The energy consumed by the fan is also illustrated in Fig. 8, which shows that the structural factors are not dominant factors determining the energy consumption of the fan. Furthermore, due to the relatively small power of the fan, the marginal value of E fan is much lower than that of E h , which is around 30% of E h . Regarding the impacts of operational parameters on E h , mainly factors D and E, it can be compared that ventilation Mode 2 where the ventilation system is operated throughout the period is better than Mode 1 where ventilation is just operated after heating from the view of a reduced E h , and the marginal value of E h is nearly reduced by 11.2%. A higher ventilation rate can also reduce the heating energy consumption, and it is calculated that the mean E h when the airspeed is 2 m/s is 32.1% lower than that when the speed is 0.2 m/s. With regard to E fan , as is shown in Fig. 8, Factor D is the only significant impact factor, and the mean E fan under Mode 2 is 28.6% higher than that under Mode 1, which is resulted by longer operation of fan. However, the increase of E fan is only half of the decrease of E h , thus Mode 2 is still better in reducing the total energy consumption. Based on the above analysis, the optimal parameters under the rule-base heating strategy are to be proposed. Even though the rules about Factor A contradict in non-ventilation and ventilation scenarios, the latter scenario should be a prior because the overall consumed energy is reduced, which is the main concern of a traditional heating system without any free renewable energy. Thus, to reduce the energy consumption, it is suggested that the floor structure be A3B3C1 (the thickness is 20 cm, the air duct diameter is 6 cm, and the distance of air duct is 10 cm). In addition, to further reduce cost, the fan is better to be operated for a longer period with a higher ventilation rate. 3.2.2 Energy consumption in a hybrid energy system Next, the simulation results of the building in the hybrid energy system are presented. In this system, the heating energy consumed from the power grid (E h,g ) and wind turbine (E h,w ) should be separated, due to the former is not free of charge, meanwhile, the main focus is to reduce this part. The accumulated wind power output in this month is 137.69 kWh. Fig. 9 shows E h,g and E h,w in the non-ventilation scenario. Overall, it can be compared that the mean E h,g of hybrid energy system is significantly reduced by more than 13.0% compared to that of the conventional energy system. It can be found out that Factor A is still the only significant impact factor on the mean E h,g and E h,w in this scenario. On the one hand, the least energy consumed from power grid is the floor with 10 cm thickness, while the mean E h,g of the 20 cm floor is the largest. On the other hand, the 20 cm floor contributes to the highest wind power consumption among the three floors thicknesses, which is 62.7% of the total produced wind power. Notably, the difference in E h,g and E h,w among the three thicknesses is not significant. Under ventilation mode, the energy consumption of the fan is shown in Fig. 10 . Different from the performance in a traditional power grid, the ventilation mode is the only significant impact factors on E fan in the hybrid energy system, and the average E fan under ventilation Mode 2 is 14.6 kWh higher than that under Mode 1. The value, however, is reduced by more than 50 kWh compared to that in a single power grid. This is caused by the operational rules set in this system where the fan is not power-on on certain occasions, and the period is much longer than that of the former energy system. The influencing rules of E h,g and E h,w under ventilation mode are compared in Fig. 10. The variance analysis results in Appendix B. show that the diameter, the ventilation mode and rate are significant impact factors for E h,g , while the thickness, the diameter and the mode are significant influencing factors for E h,w . Through ventilation, the E h,g is reduced, however, the impact is not that significant. It can be compared that the mean E h,g is reduced by around 30-50 kWh only, which is lower than the reduction caused by ventilation in a single power grid. Regarding the E h,w , it can be observed that thinner floor layers and smaller air duct distances are not beneficial for improving wind power consumption. Besides, even though a higher airspeed is not beneficial for the penetration of wind power due to the fast automation of air temperature, however, it is not as significant as that of a reduced E h,g . Overall, to improve the economy of the system in the hybrid energy system, the floor should be built based on Parameters A3B3C1 (the thickness is 20 cm, the air duct diameter is 6 cm, and the distance of air duct is 10 cm). The ventilation system should be kept on throughout the period, and the airspeed should be higher. Interestingly, this conclusion is the same as that of a single power grid system due to the same control strategy, and the reduction of the energy consumed from the power grid comes to the first place. Notably, the wind power is not fully penetrated in all the simulated cases, indicating that a more advanced control strategy should be proposed to increase the consumption of wind power. 3.3 Thermal comfort characteristics 3.3.1 Thermal comfort in a power grid Figs. 11 and 12 illustrate the R comfort,1 and R comfort,2 in a single power grid. Overall, under the rule-based control strategy, mean R comfort,1 and mean R comfort,2 of all factors are higher than 98.0%, indicating a long period of indoor living environment is thermally comfortable. In non-ventilation mode, as shown in Fig. 11, the only significant impact factor is Factor A, and thicker floor layer reduces both the R comfort,1 and R comfort,2 . For example, when the thickness is increased from 10 cm to 20 cm, R comfort,1 and R comfort,2 are reduced by 0.33% and 1.04%, respectively. The main reason for this phenomenon is the lower space heating rate of the thicker radiant heating floor in non-ventilation mode. In ventilation modes, it can be found out in both Fig.12 and Appendix B. that no significant factors exist for R comfort,1 , and thickness as well as mode are the significant influencing factors for R comfort,2 . Besides, through increasing the airspeed and the running time of the fan, both the indexes are slightly increased. It should be emphasized that even though increasing the thickness reduces the period of thermal comfort, however, the difference is not as obvious as the impact on E h , especially when comparing the data in non-ventilation and ventilation modes. Thus, E h should still be the primary consideration of parameter optimization. 3.3.2 Thermal comfort in a hybrid energy system Figs. 13 and 14 show the mean R comfort,1 and mean R comfort,2 in a hybrid energy system. Overall, it is observed that time when PMV value is within − 1 , − 0.5 or 0.5 , 1 is nearly half of the total living time, which is an acceptable thermal comfort state but not as comfortable as the states when PMV falls into − 0.5 , 0.5 , even though the temperature set-points in the control rules are within the comfort range [51]. Thus, if the heating system participates in DR, the thermal comfort will be slightly affected, but for most of the time, the indoor thermal environment is still within the acceptable range for typical residents. In non-ventilation mode, it can be concluded that thickness is still the only significant influencing factor on R comfort,1 and R comfort,2 from Fig. 13 and Appendix A., and both indexes decrease as the increase of thickness. Specifically, when the thickness rise from 10 cm to 20 cm, mean R comfort,1 and mean R comfort,2 are reduced by 0.2% and 1.04%, respectively, which are equivalent to 0.875h and 4.55h. Summary the results in Section 3.2.1, 3.2.2 and 3.3.2, if the fan is not on throughout the period, the thickness of floor should be reduced for improving the thermal comfort and lessen the power consumption. However, if the fan works, compare to non-ventilation mode, the mean R comfort,1 is about 10% higher, showing ventilation can improve the thermal comfort in the hybrid energy system under the current rule-based control strategy. Among the 5 factors, Factor D is the only significant influencing factor for mean R comfort,1 , while for mean R comfort,2 , Factor A is the only significant impact factor, as illustrated in Fig. 14 and Appendix B. In contrast to the performance of increasing floor thickness in the constant temperature operational mode in the traditional energy system, the increase of thickness leads to a longer time in the higher thermally comfortable level in the variable set-point operational mode. In addition, the operation of the fan throughout the period and the larger airspeed all contribute to an increase of higher-level thermal comfort. In summary, due to the original building conditions are thermally comfortable enough, the ventilated heating system shows weak improvement, thus, the influencing rules of all potential influencing factors are not significant from the view of evaluating thermal comfort. However, when the heating system is required to be flexibly dispatched, for example, in a power system with high a proportion of renewable energy sources, the advantages of the ventilated heating floor are highlighted compared to the conventional radiant heating floor. 3.4 Detailed thermal and energy performances of floor A3B3C1 3.4.1 Energy consumption Based on the above analysis, through comparison, the floor with the structural parameter A3B3C1 (the thickness is 20 cm, the air duct diameter is 6 cm, and the distance of air duct is 10 cm) shows the best energy consumption performance than others in both the reduction of the energy consumption from the power grid and the increase of the wind power consumption, especially under ventilation mode. However, the results are shown as marginal mean value, so an in-depth and specific analysis is needed. In this section, the energy consumption of the floor with the structure A3B3C1 under different ventilation modes and energy systems are calculated. Fig. 15 shows the energy consumed by different instruments (electrothermal film and fan) in Energy System 1 (the first bar). It can be observed that the energy consumption under all ventilation modes is lower than that under non-ventilation mode. Except for the similar qualitative conclusions obtained in Section 3.2.1 regarding the impact of ventilation and ventilation rate, it can be quantified that for this floor, the total consumed energy from the power grid can be maximally reduce through ventilation by 40.8% and 46.3% respectively under the two ventilation modes if the ventilation rate is increased from 0.2 m/s to 2.0 m/s, which is far higher than the average performance of all the floors in the parametric study. Even though E fan is higher in Mode 2, the total consumed energy still decreases. Thus, for Floor A3B3C1, it is still suggested to operate under ventilation Mode 2 with a higher rate. The energy consumed from the power grid (the second bar) and the wind turbine (the third bar) in the hybrid energy system of the ventilated heating floor with the Structural Parameter A3B3C1 is also shown in Fig. 15. It can be observed that the impact of ventilation Mode 2 on reducing the sum of E h,g and E fan is more significant than that under Mode 1. Specifically, when the ventilation rate is increased from 0.2 m/s to 2.0 m/s, the value is reduced by 16.6% and 49.3% under the two ventilation modes, and the reduction of E h, g, UDR1 is the most significant. Compared to the performance in reducing energy consumption from the power grid, the contribution of an increased wind speed on an increasing wind power penetration is not obvious, and the consumption of wind power is even reduced with the increase of ventilation rate. It can be compared that the sum of E h,UDR1 and E h,UDR2 under Mode 1 at the rate of 0.2 m/s is about 7.0 kWh higher than that in non-ventilation mode, however, as the ventilation rate increases, the total consumed wind energy decreases. The same is true for ventilation Mode 2, and when the airspeed is 2.0 m/s under this mode, the total consumed wind power is 5.4 kWh lower than the non-ventilation mode. As the consumed energy is highly relevant to the operational time, possible reasons will be analyzed in the next paragraph. It can also be concluded that the impact of ventilation on wind power consumption is not obvious, which has also been proved in Section 3.2.2. Fig. 16 shows the participation rate under different operational modes. In this month, the sum of DDR, UDR1 and UDR2 events are 460h, 216h and 68h, respectively. The R DDR increases with the ventilation rate, which means that the increase of the ventilation rate contributes to a shorter operating time of heating film when the wind power output is zero. It is also verified in Fig. 15 that E h,DDR decreases significantly. Regarding to UDR1, the participation rate significantly decreases as the ventilation rate, which means that the time of consuming the wind power with partial output is strongly affected by the ventilation rate. From the view of system automation, the operating time of the electrothermal film will be reduce by a higher airspeed, thus both the participation rate and consumed wind power will be reduced. Besides, the performance of ventilation Mode 1 is better than Mode 2 in increasing E h,w,UDR and R UDR1 , which is because the heating time under Mode 1 is not affected by the ventilation system. For UDR2, even though the total time when environmental wind speed is higher than 6.0 m/s is shorter than that of the UDR1 and DDR, the participation rate in UDR2 is higher than that in UDR1, especially under ventilation Modes 2 in UDR2, which is mainly caused by the initial thermal state determined by the former period. Even though the ventilation system and the currently set rules are proved to result in a lower operational cost in both single power grid and hybrid energy system, however, the wind power use is not as good as expected under the currently set control rules. This indicates that an improvement is needed for the control strategy, for example, operation based on the goal of maximally reducing energy consumed from the power grid, meanwhile penetrating more wind power. It should also be noted that many factors including market incentives and energy policies will also affect the operation, which is completely ignored in this study. 3.4.2 Thermal comfort analysis Fig. 17 shows T s and PMV of the three ventilation modes. It can be compared that the temperature fluctuation in Mode 2 is the lowest among that of the three modes, and the maximal value is only 0.5 °C. The worst performance of temperature stability is found under Mode 1, in which the maximal temperature fluctuation is about 6.0 °C. It should also be noticed that this ventilation mode can also cause abrupt temperature drop when the state of the system is to be shifted from the free cooling stage to the heating stage especially when the ambient temperature is very low. For example, on the 10th day, the ambient temperature is below −20 °C, and it can be observed that when the room is to be heated by the system, the air temperature is reduced by about 1.5 °C before rising again. Regarding the PMV in Fig. 17, its variation is highly relevant to the air temperature. The low air temperature in the initial hours is the main reason for the low PMV in that period, which also leads to that the R comfort,1 and R comfort,2 are lower than 100% in some cases. In Energy System 1, when the airspeed is 2.0 m/s, R comfort,1 s in the three modes are 98.2%, 70.1% and 98.5%, respectively, while R comfort,2 s in the three modes are 98.2%, 98.2% and 99.2%. Thus, from the view of improving thermal comfort, it is not suggested to use ventilation Mode 1, and ventilation Mode 2 is a better choice. Fig. 18 shows the temperature and PMV in a hybrid energy system. It can be observed that the room experiences different temperature variations in three kinds of DR scenarios. In the downward DR, the temperature fluctuated around the lower set temperature bound (18 °C) under the two ventilation modes, and the continual temperature fluctuation implies that the heating and ventilation systems frequently operate during that period. While for the non-ventilation mode, T s in DDR fluctuates with a lower frequency and a larger amplitude. In the upward DR event, the thermal performance in the two UDR events is also different. In UDR1, the ventilation mode remains unchanged before reaching the set upper temperature limit, and it can be found out that the space air temperature under ventilation Mode 2 fluctuates around the set upper limit with a lower frequency than in DDR. Under non-ventilation mode, T s also fluctuates at around 24 °C when reaching the upper bound. Whereas under Mode 1, the temperature will rise sharply when it is around the upper limit. Regarding the heating rate, it can be found out that the heating rate under ventilation Mode 2 is higher than that under the other two ventilation modes. For example, on the 17th day, when the air temperature is increased from 22.5 °C to 24.0 °C, it takes about 4.7h under ventilation Mode 2, whereas it is 5.3h and 5.1h under non-ventilation and ventilation Mode 1, respectively. In UDR2, the temperature under non-ventilation mode is hardly higher than 24.0 °C. While under the other two ventilation modes, it can be observed that the temperature is always higher than the upper limit when there is demand for forced heating due to the high ambient wind speed, and this phenomenon is more significant under ventilation Mode 1. The PMV results are also summarized in Fig. 18. When the airspeed is 2.0 m/s, R comfort,1 and R comfort,2 are 44.6% and 98.2% in non-ventilation mode, 51.0% and 85.7% in Mode 1, as well as 65.0% and 96.7% in Mode 2. It shows that even though the thermal comfort is affected in the DR scenario, ventilation can improve the indoor thermal environment by reducing the time when the air temperature is beyond the less comfortable and unacceptable range. Specifically, the time of PMV falls in three numerical intervals in each DR stage are also summarized in Fig. 18, where the sum of time is the same. It is illustrated that Mode 2 is more advanced in improving thermal comfort in all the three DR stages. Compared to Non-ventilation mode and Mode 1, the R comfort,1,DDR in Mode 2 is increased by 13.2% and 9.1%. R comfort,1 s in Mode 2 in UDR1 and UDR2 stages are also larger than those in the other two modes. Overall, comprehensively considering the thermal comfort in the two energy systems, it can be concluded that ventilation Mode 2 is a more advanced method to increase thermal comfort and the speed of thermal response, even though it causes frequent starts and stops to the heating system. 4 Conclusion In this study, the energy and thermal performance of low-energy buildings equipped with the ventilated electric heating floor was analyzed. A simplified thermal model for a prototype building, which was integrated with a validated ventilated heating floor model and the standard structure of low-energy buildings, was established and validated through on-site measurement. A rule-based control strategy was also proposed. An orthogonal experiment and variance analyses were conducted to reduce the number of simulated cases meanwhile analyzing the impact of different structural and operational parameters on the consumption of conventional power sources, wind power and thermal comfort. Several indexes including PMV and energy were used to evaluate the flexibility potential. The following are the main conclusions. \u2022 In a conventional energy system, the thickness of floor is the only significant factor affecting the heating energy consumption under non-ventilation mode. From the view of reducing energy consumption meanwhile improving thermal comfort, the thickness should be reduced. When ventilation takes effect, different influencing rules are observed: the energy consumption of electrothermal film is reduced by about 27.2% compared to that in non-ventilation mode, and it is also reduced by increasing the ventilation rate. The thermal comfort, however, is less affected by the change of parameters. \u2022 In a hybrid energy system, it is found out that a thicker floor is beneficial to consuming the free wind power, however, it can not compensate for the increased consumption of conventional power source and the decreased thermal comfort time period under non-ventilation mode. Under ventilation mode, however, a thicker floor is conducive to decreasing general power consumption meanwhile increasing wind power penetration, as well as improving thermal comfort. Meanwhile, increasing the diameter of air duct and reducing the distance of air ducts can also conduce to lower energy costs. From the view of reducing cost, it is suggested to switch on the fan and increase the airspeed, and the suggested structural parameters is A3B3C1. \u2022 A detailed analysis was conducted on Floor A3B3C1, the results show that the conventional power consumption is reduced by around 50% when the ventilation rate is increased from 0.2 m/s to 2.0 m/s. However, the wind power consumption is reduced with the increase of airspeed, and the participation time of the system is significantly reduced under ventilation Mode 2 in upward demand response when the ambient wind speed is within 2.0 m/s to 6.0 m/s. \u2022 The heating of space air can also be accelerated through ventilation, especially at a higher ventilation rate within a reasonable range. In a conventional energy system, compared to ventilation Mode 1, ventilation Mode 2 is more beneficial to keep a stable room thermal environment and increase the time duration of thermal comfort, where the maximum temperature fluctuation under ventilation Mode 2 is only about 0.5 °C. In a hybrid energy system, restricted by the set rules, the pattern of temperature variation varies in different stages, and ventilation Mode 2 shows more sensitive characteristics, which also results in a frequent change of system state. Even so, the thermally comfortable time is significantly extended in Mode 2. In this study, the wind power consumption characteristics of the heating system are briefly investigated, however, many factors are ignored, i.e. the details of the connection between the wind turbine and the heating system, as well as the energy loss of the system. Besides, restricted by the set rules, the performance is not good enough including the wind power consumption under specific operational modes, and the room temperature in some DR scenarios. In the future, an actual ventilated heating system connected to the renewable energy system in the demonstrated nearly zero-energy buildings will be constructed, and the actual performance of the wind power heating system can be analyzed. Besides, predictive control methods, like the economic model predictive control, will also be conducted based on the proposed thermal network model, so as to optimize the operation of the new space heating system, and the economic factors will be further considered.

        "dc:description": "The exploration of the thermal energy storage potential of building thermal mass is an important and economic means to increase the flexibility of energy use in buildings. Feasible ways to increase the flexibility characteristic, however, are still rare. In this study, the energy consumption and thermal performance of a building with a novel ventilated electric heating floor were investigated through a simplified thermal network model, which was validated by on-site measurement. Aimed at analyzing the performance of the building in different energy systems, multi-energy sources were assumed to supply power to the heating system, including a common power grid and an independent residential wind turbine. The impact of five parameters was simulated, including the floor thickness, the diameter and the distance of air ducts, the ventilation mode and the ventilation rate. To reduce the number of simulated cases, the orthogonal testing method was adopted. Based on the goal of reducing energy consumption from the power grid, increasing consuming wind power and improving thermal comfort, the best structural parameters of the floor were obtained. In traditional systems, it is found out that the ventilated floor with these structural parameters can maximally reduce the heating energy consumption by 46.3% when the fan is on throughout the period. In the hybrid energy system, the consumption of energy in the power grid is also reduced, but the wind power consumption is not increased with the ventilation rate under the set operational rules. The thermal comfort, however, is significantly improved by ventilation.",
