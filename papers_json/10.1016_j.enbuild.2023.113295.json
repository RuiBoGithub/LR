In the era of post-Coronavirus Disease 2019, the dedicated outdoor air system (DOAS), which provides 100% outdoor air for the building, is widely acknowledged as it can ensure acceptable indoor air quality by delivering fresh outdoor air to occupied space. The DOAS with a proper design and operation can provide sufficient ventilation and dehumidification while achieving energy efficiency. Nonetheless, there is limited guidance in determining the optimal control sequence of the DOAS for the designers and operators to implement in practice. Accordingly, in practice, a number of issues have been acknowledged in the design and control phases of DOAS, including insufficient ventilation and dehumidification, and increasing supply air dry-bulb temperature in fear of over-cooling, which might cause significant discomfort and energy waste. There have been efforts to develop high-performing DOAS controls for better energy efficiency. However, such controls are often complex, or difficult to interpret, for building designers and operators to consider in practice. In this regard, this paper explores a simulation-based framework for generating a supply air temperature control sequence of the DOAS not only to ensure improved energy-saving potential but also to guarantee the implement-ability of the control logic. The U.S. Department of Energy prototype primary school with dynamic occupancy profiles was modeled with a whole building simulation program, EnergyPlus. The model consists of a DOAS with an exhaust air energy recovery system for ventilation and fan-coil units for space cooling and heating. Then, a Genetic Algorithm was adopted to find the true optimal supply air temperature control sequence in terms of minimizing the energy cost of the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system operation. Lastly, Decision Tree was adopted to extract rules out of the optimums to derive an implementable sequence of operation for the DOAS supply air temperature. A total of 12 week-simulation including four weeks of heating, cooling, and shoulder seasons, separately, under the weather condition of New York City was conducted for the case study. This case study identified that the optimization-informed rule extraction-based control, when compared to conventional outdoor air temperature-based reset control, could save about 13% of energy cost and 25% of energy consumption throughout the heating, cooling, and shoulder seasons. It is notable that the energy-saving was mainly achieved by reducing the heating energy consumption. Importantly, it nearly corresponds to the true optimal control result, which reduces approximately 14% of energy cost and 27% of energy consumption. From the results, it can be highlighted that the optimization-informed rule extraction can be as energy effective as the optimal control, while significantly reducing the complexity of the control.

In this regard, the pursuit of energy-efficient air conditioning system designs and operations for buildings has received a lot of attention [2]. In buildings, HVAC systems play two key roles. The first is to maintain the indoor thermal environment through space heating, cooling, and dehumidification. The other is to bring fresh outdoor air inside to maintain indoor air quality (IAQ) [3]. In conventional HVAC systems (e.g., typical constant air volume (CAV) and variable air volume (VAV) systems) in commercial buildings, a single unit of the HVAC system is typically designed to cover not only the sensible and latent loads but also the required ventilation rate for the IAQ [4\u20136]. However, the demands for thermal loads (i.e., sensible and latent loads) and ventilation do not always match [7,8]. Consequently, utilizing a single HVAC system to cover all of the sensible load, latent load, and ventilation requirements could overestimate the outdoor air intake, which eventually causes oversizing of the system components and energy waste. Dedicated outdoor air system (DOAS) has been widely acknowledged as a potential solution to overcome this issue, by decoupling the functions of handling the sensible load, latent load, and ventilation requirement. ASHRAE Design Guide for Dedicated Outdoor Air Systems defines DOAS as follows: \u201cDOAS uses separate equipment to condition all of the outdoor air brought into a building for ventilation and delivers it to each occupied space, either directly or in conjunction with local or central HVAC units serving those same spaces. The local or central HVAC units are used to maintain space temperature\u201d [9]. Fig. 1 depicts conceptual diagrams for the conventional HVAC systems (e.g., CAV or VAV) and the DOAS. The conventional HVAC systems, which represent the typical systems of commercial buildings in the U.S., draw outside air, mix it with return air at the mixing box, and then use cooling and heating coils within the system units to condition the air before distributing it to occupied zones [10]. In such cases, a single air handling unit is designed to cover all the sensible load (by mixing with return air, a cooling coil, and heating coils), latent load (by removing moisture using a cooling coil), and ventilation requirement (by outdoor air). On the other hand, the DOAS provides 100% outdoor air (i.e., no returning air being mixed to incoming outdoor air) for ventilation and removes the latent loads (i.e., dehumidification) by conditioning the incoming outdoor air using a cooling coil (as shown in the Loop-1 in Fig. 1 (b)) [11]. Naturally, the cooling coil covers the sensible load to some extent, which is primarily a byproduct of dehumidification. Then, a heating coil activates to reheat the cooled air to a certain designated supply air setpoint temperature. In addition, as the DOAS is installed mainly for ventilation and dehumidification purposes, separate terminal HVAC units (e.g., fan-coil unit (FCU), variable refrigerant flow system, heat pumps, etc.) are often required for remaining space heating and cooling (in Loop-2 in Fig. 1 (b)). 1.1 Benefits of Dedicated outdoor air system (DOAS) Based on the distinguishing features of the DOAS aforementioned in Section 1, the DOAS can be particularly beneficial, as listed in the following. (1) Ensuring sufficient ventilation and dehumidification [12]. The DOAS units should be designed to provide sufficient fresh outdoor air to occupants by conforming to the ventilation and acceptable indoor air quality requirements suggested by ASHRAE Standard 62.1\u20132019 [13]. In addition, a cooling coil installed within the DOAS unit should be designed to sufficiently condition the incoming outdoor air below a designated dew point temperature. On top of that, adopting demand-controlled ventilation (DCV) enables the DOAS to handle space latent load for each zone [14]. Importantly, the DOAS conditions the outdoor air independently from the returning air, enabling precise tracking of the outdoor airflow. This can lead to improved humidity and ventilation controls in occupied zones [9]. (2) Energy efficiency. As DOAS decouples the functions of covering total sensible load, latent load, and ventilation requirement using the same HVAC system, the DOAS often requires less volumetric airflow rate compared to the other traditional HVAC systems (i.e., CAV or VAV systems) [15]. These traits of the DOAS not only allow to downsize the HVAC equipment (e.g., fan, chillers, boilers) but also reduce the energy consumption in HVAC operation [9,11]. In addition, DOAS is often equipped with energy recovery systems (e.g., total energy wheel, passive or active desiccant wheel) to enhance its energy performance [16]. Nevertheless, such heat recovery systems can rather cause energy waste depending on the weather condition, for instance, by prohibiting free-cooling in cooling seasons [17]. Therefore, it is significant to come up with a proper design and operation for DOAS to fully take advantage of its energy efficiency. (3) Diversified terminal units for heating and cooling. Given that DOAS satisfies both ventilation and dehumidification requirements, there are more options for terminal units for heating and cooling. For instance, passive chilled beams or radiant panels are recognized to promote energy efficiency and occupant\u2019s thermal comfort, but such systems are insufficient for ventilation and dehumidification purposes [18,19]. In this regard, DOAS can offer advantages when used in conjunction with such systems (i.e., passive chilled beams or radiant panels). Regardless of the advantages of the DOAS, there is still limited literature in determining the control sequence of the DOAS for the building operators to implement. It is well acknowledged that the overall energy performance of the DOAS depends highly on its control sequence [20]. However, the supply air temperature control for DOAS in practice, still, tend to rely on simple rule-based control strategies (e.g., resetting the DOAS supply air temperature based on outdoor air dry-bulb temperature) [9]. Murphy [21] reported a few issues related to controls of DOAS, including insufficient ventilation and dehumidification, and particularly, increasing supply air temperature in fear of over-cooling. These issues prohibit taking the full advantage of the DOAS\u2019 potential benefits. For example, insufficient ventilation and dehumidification could not only cause severe discomfort to occupants but also be harmful to occupant\u2019s health [22,23]. Moreover, increasing supply air temperature might result in a significant energy waste by causing redundant reheating [21]. The aforementioned issues have a strong connection to and thus have an impact on determining the DOAS supply air temperature control sequence. As stated in the ASHRAE\u2019s Design Guide for Dedicated Outdoor Air Systems, in most cases, the dehumidification process determines the dry-bulb air temperature leaving DOAS units [9]. Moreover, ASHRAE [9] and Mumma [24] claim that provided it doesn't compromise occupant comfort levels and is compatible with the other zonal HVAC system components, supplying the conditioned outdoor air close to the output of the dehumidification process is typically the most energy-efficient and cost-effective way of controlling DOAS units. Furthermore, recently, advanced controls have gained attention for enhanced energy performance. For instance, Ge et al. [25] proposed a model-based multivariate controls for DOAS and chilled ceiling system by optimizing both DOAS supply air temperature and humidity along with chilled ceiling supply air temperature. Yet, regardless of the developments on the DOAS controls, it is challenging for building designers and operators to translate such principles or optimal control strategies into a practical control sequence. In this regard, there is a need to come up with easily implementable sequence of operations for the DOAS. 1.2 Rule extraction-based building controls Current HVAC system controls for buildings typically rely on straightforward rule-based control strategies, which are typically selected heuristically by building designers and operators [26]. These kinds of controls are easy to implement but are likely to be inferior to other more advanced control techniques (e.g., model predictive control, reinforcement learning-based control) in terms of energy performance [27]. In this regard, many studies have been conducted to determine how HVAC systems can be controlled optimally using model predictive controls (MPC) [28] or reinforcement learning (RL)-based controls [29\u201331]. The aforementioned optimal control strategies (i.e., MPC, RL) often demonstrate promising energy-saving potential. However, such strategies require a significant amount of computation time and resources. In addition, the strategies are hardly interpretable to building operators. These limitations prohibit the optimal control to be applied in actual building automation systems (BAS). To overcome these issues, rule extraction-based HVAC controls have been actively studied [26,27,32\u201335]. In the studies, simple rule extraction (RE)-based controls have been formed to mimic optimal controls. It has been proven that such RE-based controls are almost as energy-efficient as the optimal controls (i.e., near-optimal) while still being straightforward for simple implementations [30]. May-Ostendorp et al. [26] demonstrated a proof-of-concept of model-predictive control (MPC) with rule extraction in a mixed-mode office building. First, MPC strategy for window operation was explored using particle swarm optimization (PSO). Then, a statistical technique (i.e., Generalized linear model (GLM)) was adopted to mimic the optimal window operation sequence suggested by the MPC. It was highlighted that the GLM extracted the characteristics of the optimal results to achieve a significant energy-saving potential with a reduced complexity of the model. Bursill et al. [33] validated the concept by applying simplified MPC via rule extraction to an existing institutional building located in Ottawa, Canada. A total of eight weeks of cooling period and nine weeks of heating period were considered for the in-situ field implementation. The MPC was developed to control VAV damper position and VAV reheat coil valves in the cooling period and radiant heater valve position was added on top of the two variables in the heating period. As a result, it was proposed that considerable amount of energy could be saved (i.e., cooling: 28%, heating 33%) through the RE control compared to the reactive control. This concept of rule extraction in building HVAC control was further enhanced by Cho and Park [27], from which the authors extracted rules from reinforcement learning (RL)-based HVAC controller. In the study, Deep Q-Network (DQN) was used to reduce the cooling energy consumption of an existing building, which consists of a geo-thermal heat pump and ice thermal storage as part of its cooling system. Then, a decision tree was adopted to extract rules from the DQN in order to come up with a reduced-order model that can achieve energy saving while making the control logic of the DQN understandable. Recently, the optimization-informed rule extraction has become an emerging concept for attaining high energy efficiency with explainable HVAC system operation sequences, and such a framework could be applied for developing control sequences for DOAS systems. 1.3 Scope and objective of this study As for the DOAS systems, there is a significant research gap on investigating supply air temperature control sequence that is not only energy efficient and cost effective but also implementable in practice. In this regard, this study identified a potential for exploring optimization-informed rule extraction for such DOAS control. The main contribution of this study is on demonstrating the feasibility and effectiveness of a thorough process of (1) developing a simulation-based DOAS model, (2) optimizing the DOAS control sequence, and (3) implementing the optimization-informed rule extraction to prove its energy efficiency and interpretability. Fig. 2 details the scope of this study. First, a whole building energy performance model for a primary school was developed with EnergyPlus. The target model consists of a DOAS with an exhaust air energy recovery system and fan coil units (FCUs) for its HVAC systems. Then, genetic algorithm (GA)-based optimization was explored to derive the optimal supply air temperature of the DOAS. Optimal supply air temperature for varying seasons (i.e., heating, cooling, and shoulder seasons) are generated. Next, an interpretable machine learning (ML) model (i.e., decision tree) was adopted to extract rules out of the generated optimum data to come up with a simple and practical \u2018if-then-else\u2019 rules. These rules are, then, evaluated in the EnergyPlus virtual testbed. For this study, the EnergyPlus Energy Management System (EMS) was adopted for the virtual testbed to evaluate the optimization-informed rules. The optimization-informed rule extraction-based control was compared with the typical rule-based control (i.e., outdoor air dry-bulb temperature-based reset control) and the optimal control to demonstrate its effectiveness in terms of energy efficiency (i.e., energy cost and energy consumption) and capability to maintain acceptable zone air temperature. The structure of this paper is as follows: Section 2 elaborates on the methodologies regarding building energy modeling, optimal control, and rule extraction. Section 3 demonstrates the simulation results and discusses the findings. Section 4 and 5 wrap up by conclusions and future work, respectively. 2 Methodology This section describes detailed explanations of the overall process of this study (i.e., Fig. 2) in terms of methodology adopted for the building energy modeling, optimization, and rule extraction processes, in order. 2.1 Building energy modeling using EnergyPlus 2.1.1 Model geometry The EnergyPlus commercial prototype primary school model developed by the Department of Energy (DOE) is selected as a target building. This prototype building model was created conforming to the ASHRAE Standard 90.1\u20132019 [36]. The model has been widely used in various studies to analyze building energy performance [37,38]. The outlook of the target building is depicted in Fig. 3 . It is a one-story building with a total floor area of 6,871 m2. Within the building, Pod 1, which consists of four classrooms (i.e., 2 multi classrooms and 2 corner classrooms), is selected as target zones (Fig. 4 ). Each multi classroom (MC 1, MC 2) and corner classroom (CC 1, CC 2) accounts for 477 m2 and 99 m2, respectively. The building, studied in this paper, is assumed to be in New York City, NY, which is a representative city for ASHRAE climate zone 4A [36]. 2.1.2 Occupancy profiles Building occupancy is one of the most important aspects to consider in building energy simulation as the HVAC, lighting, equipment, and other internal loads are largely dependent on occupancy profiles [39,40]. Importantly, occupancy profiles are innately stochastic both in time and space [41]. In order to reflect the stochastic nature of occupancy, dynamic occupancy profiles are taken into consideration for the target zones in the primary school model. For this study, occupancy schedules based on the real primary school calendar in Colorado were used, as adopted by a previous study [37]. The schedules took students\u2019 movement between the classrooms, lunch hours, and summer/fall/winter breaks, etc. into account. Fig. 5 depicts a sample one-day occupancy schedule for the classrooms in Pod 1. 2.1.3 HVAC system modeling The target primary school model consists of a DOAS unit that contains a cooling coil, reheat coil, and total-energy (enthalpy) wheel. It is a typical DOAS configuration suggested in the ASHRAE Design Guide for Dedicated Outdoor Air System [9] (Fig. 6 ). The upper stream describes the path for incoming outdoor air (OA). OA passes through total-energy wheel (OA\u2019), then, to be conditioned by the cooling and heating coil, subsequently. After all, the conditioned air is distributed to the zones by the supply air (SA). The lower stream is the exhaust air (EA) from zones, and it transfers energy to incoming outdoor air before being totally exhausted from the air handling unit (EA\u2019). It is notable that the air distributed to zones is 100% outdoor air as there is no portion of return air being mixed with the incoming outdoor air. A VAV fan is adopted for the DOAS supply fan to realize DCV. The fixed-plate heat exchanger could be installed between the cooling and heating coils with the purpose of further reducing the reheat energy. However, this type of system configuration was not considered for this paper. We plan to investigate the performance of such configuration in the future work. The incoming outdoor airflow rate is determined based on the ventilation requirement in ASHRAE Standard 62.1\u20132019 [13]. It is suggested that the breathing zone outdoor airflow ( V bz ) should first be calculated, as shown in Eq. (1). The V bz is then divided by the zone air distribution effectiveness to derive the amount of outdoor airflow ( V oz ) that the supply air distribution system should provide Eq. (2). (1) V bz = R p P z + R a A z (2) V oz = V bz / E z Where P z is number of occupants, A z is zone floor area, R p is outdoor airflow rate required per person, R a is outdoor airflow rate required per unit area, and E z is the zone air distribution effectiveness. According to ASHRAE Standard 62.1\u20132019 [13], it can be assumed that R p = 5 L/s and R a = 0.6 L/s∙m2 for classroom. In addition, assuming that the DOAS terminal unit discharges the cool air (i.e., cooler than the zone air) from ceiling-mounted diffusers and retrieves zone air returns back to return grills in the ceiling, E z = 1. As a result, the DOAS supply airflow rate can be determined based on the design V oz value, which in the case of our target building is approximately 2,170 L/s (2.17 m3/s). As the DOAS unit mainly exists for the ventilation purposes, separated zonal HVAC systems are required for space heating and cooling. For this study, FCUs are modeled in each zone along with the DOAS loop. Each classroom in Pod 1 is equipped with an FCU and all four classrooms is connected to a single DOAS loop. For the plant loop of the model, a cooling tower, water-cooled chiller, and a gas-fired condensing boiler are installed to supply cooling, chilled and hot water, respectively, for the DOAS and FCUs (Fig. 7 ). Please note that the HVAC components (i.e., DOAS supply fan, cooling tower, chiller, and boiler) are auto-sized based on the typical meteorological year (TMY) weather data of New York City in EnergyPlus. For reference, the model inputs relevant to the HVAC system modeling for the target zones are detailed in Table 1 . All the zones other than Pod 1 (e.g., Pods 2 and 3, library, gym, etc.) are modeled with an ideal load system. This ideal load system provides space conditioning (i.e., cooling or heating) for the non-target zones to meet the specified thermal loads (i.e., thermostat setpoint and setback in Table 1). The cooling coil outlet (i.e., marked and highlighted in yellow in Fig. 7) temperature is determined to be a fixed dewpoint of 9 ℃, as used by the practitioners [43]. This fixed value should be chosen to effectively remove the latent load in the target zones. The fixed dewpoint temperature can be calculated using the following Eq. (3) [9]. This study adopted 3.0 as a multiplier, which is the value derived from the air properties (i.e., density and latent heat of vaporization) at the standard air conditions, as defined by ASHRAE [9]. (3) Q space , l a t e n t = 3.0 V oz ( W space - W ca ) Where Q space , l a t e n t is the zone occupant latent load, V oz is the volumetric outdoor airflow rate, W space is the maximum limit for the humidity ratio for the zone, and W ca is the required humidity ratio at the cooling coil outlet. The overall occupancy is set at 310 (i.e., roughly the maximum capacity for all the classrooms at once) and the occupant latent heat gain is assumed to be 45 W per person [43]. In addition, the zone outdoor airflow rate ( V oz ) is designed to be 2.17 m3/s according to ASHRAE Standard 62.1\u20132019 [13], and the W space is set to be approximately 9.2 g/kg (Approximate humidity ratio @ 24 ℃ and RH = 50%). As a result, the W ca is calculated to be approximately 7.13 g/kg, which results in the T ca to be 9 ℃. Even though T ca can vary when different assumptions are made, T ca = 9 ℃ corresponds to the required dewpoint temperature range of cooling coil outlet temperature for classrooms suggested in [43]. 2.2 Optimal supply air temperature control using Genetic Algorithm Genetic Algorithm (GA) is selected as an optimization algorithm to search for the optimal supply air temperature control sequence. Genetic algorithm is a popular metaheuristic algorithm that has been widely used for building HVAC system controls [44\u201347]. GA imitates the concept of the survival of the fittest. First, populations, a terminology for probable candidates for solutions, are created at random. Each population is rated according to its fitness score, which is established by an objective function (e.g., minimizing energy consumption or energy cost). High fitness populations are chosen as the parents, and these parents generate children through mating and crossover procedures. Moreover, the children mutate themselves to enlarge the search space and increase the likelihood of discovering better solutions. The entire process is repeated over several generations to come up with the best solution with the highest fitness score. Fig. 8 represents the conceptual flowchart of the GA. For this study, PyGAD, a popular GA library in Python, is adopted [48]. Genetic algorithms require hyperparameter inputs such as number of generations, population, crossover rate, and mutation rate. Table 2 lists hyperparameters for GA used for the optimizations in this study. The hyperparameters, including the number of generations, population, and the crossover and mutation rates, are empirically determined to ensure a search ended with the global optimum. The effectiveness of the hyperparameters is demonstrated below in Fig. 10 of Section 3 case study results. 2.3 Rule extraction using decision tree Decision Tree (DT) is one of the most popular supervised machine-learning algorithms that can perform accurate predictions in both classification and regression problems. In this regard, many building energy and HVAC studies have adopted the DT where accurate energy predictions are required [49\u201352]. Moreover, using DT, it is possible to visualize the process of the prediction. In other words, DT can be a powerful algorithm that can explain its predictions [53]. A DT model forms a tree-like structure based on two different types of nodes: decision nodes and leaf nodes [53]. Decision nodes represent questions that could result in two or more possible choices. And these choices are termed as leaf nodes. The process of a decision node splitting into multiple leaf nodes is called branching. Fig. 9 depicts an example of decision tree that predicts a control mode of an air conditioning system based on outdoor air temperature and the number of occupants. The tree will recursively split its branches until the tree is optimal in terms of minimizing its prediction errors [50]. However, while aiming for the minimal error, the rules are likely to become too complicated or difficult to understand. For the rules to be comprehensible, tuning hyperparameters, such as the maximum depth of the tree or the minimum decrease in errors, may be necessary. The benefit of the \u2018interpretability\u2019 prompted the DT to play a significant role in rule extraction. Recently, the rule extraction function of DT has been actively adopted of building HVAC control [27,32,34,35]. In such studies, DT is adopted to train the optimal control strategies to extract rules out of them. This process alleviates the complexity of the optimal control strategies for them to be interpretable and practical. 3 Case study results This study focused on developing an optimization-informed rule extraction framework for deriving DOAS supply air temperatures that can achieve both the ventilation level and energy efficiency. As shown in Section 2.1, it was illustrated the target building consists of the DOAS supply fan that is sized based on [13] to fulfill required ventilation level and is equipped with a cooling coil with a fixed dewpoint of 9 ℃ to ensure sufficient dehumidification. In the following subsections, details of optimization-informed rule extraction-based DOAS control are explained in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the control strategy in terms of energy performance (i.e., energy cost and energy consumption). 3.1 Optimization of DOAS supply air temperature For this study, DOAS supply air temperature optimization was implemented for a total of 12 weeks in varying outdoor air conditions (i.e., 4 heating weeks, 4 cooling weeks, 4 shoulder weeks). Table 3 describes the exact periods for the optimization task. The objective function (i.e., the fitness function for GA) is formulated to minimize the overall HVAC system operational cost for each timestep (i.e., hourly) (Eq. (4)). It is noteworthy that the zone air temperatures are primarily set to meet the setpoints and setbacks mentioned in Table 1. In addition, the lower and upper boundaries of the supply air dry-bulb temperatures are set to be 9 ℃ and 15.5 ℃, respectively(Eq. (5)). The lower bound is determined based on an assumption that the supply air temperature should be equal or higher than cooling coil outlet air temperature (i.e., 9 ℃). The upper bound is set at 15.5 ℃ to prevent condensation in humid climate conditions [54]. (4) F i n d m i n f ( x ) = α E gas + β E elec (5) Subject to × ∈ [9 ℃, 15.5 ℃] Where α and β are rates for natural gas and electricity, and E gas and E elec represent hourly gas and electricity consumption, respectively. In this study, fixed rates for natural gas and electricity for New York reported in 2020 EIA data are adopted (i.e., Electricity rate: 14.87 U.S. cents/kWh; Natural gas: 36.24 U.S. cents/m3) [55]. Fig. 10 shows the total data points that the GA searched (sky-blue nodes in Fig. 10) to extract the optimal values (red nodes in Fig. 10). Fig. 10 (a), (b), (c) represent sample results of the optimization for heating, cooling, and shoulder seasons, respectively. As can be observed, nearly every value between the stated boundaries (i.e., [9 ℃, 15.5 ℃]) was explored, allowing the GA to derive the global optimal. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the hyperparameters in Table 2. As a result, it can be seen that the optimal values differ depending on the timestep with most of them found in the lower half of the boundary (i.e., below 12 ℃) regardless of the season (i.e., different outdoor air condition). To demonstrate the effectiveness of the optimal control (OC), it is compared to the typical rule-based control (RBC) in terms of energy cost and energy consumption. For the RBC, a reset logic based on the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature was adopted. It is typically suggested that when dehumidification is required, the supply air temperature should be set at or below 12.8 ℃ (55 ℉) [56\u201358]. In this regard, 12.8 ℃ is selected as a baseline temperature. Moreover, ASHRAE Standard 90.1\u20132019 [36] recommends that HVAC systems connected to multiple zones should have controls that may reset supply air temperature in response to representative building loads or outside air temperature. Such a reset is required to be at least 25% of the difference between the design supply air temperature and the design zone air temperature [36]. For instance, if the design indoor air temperature is 24 ℃ and the design supply air temperature is 12.8 ℃, a minimum adjustment of 2.7 ℃ should be considered, bringing the supply air temperature to or above 15.5 ℃. Meanwhile, supply air temperature above 15.5 ℃ is not considered as it might cause condensation issues in humid climates [54]. In this regard, the lower and upper limits of the supply air temperature are determined to be 12.8 ℃ and 15.5 ℃, respectively. For this study, an exemplary supply air reset control strategy that conforms to the stated boundaries (i.e., 12.8 ℃ and 15.5 ℃), adopted by a previous study [59], was considered as the RBC (Fig. 11 ). According to the selected RBC, the DOAS supply air temperature setpoint is set to 12.8 ℃ when the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature is higher than 21 ℃ and the DOAS supply air temperature setpoint shall be 15.5 ℃ when the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature is lower than 15.5 ℃ [59]. Table 4 compares the results of typical RBC to OC in terms of energy cost in the heating, cooling, and shoulder months, respectively (i.e., periods mentioned in Table 3). It is found that approximately 8.5%, 11.6%, 15.7% of energy cost was reduced in heating, cooling, and shoulder seasons, respectively. In addition, the energy consumption in each season by system components is elaborated in subsequent tables (Table 5 , Table 6 , and Table 7 ). About 17.2%, 24.2%, 36.0% of energy consumption was reduced in heating, cooling, and shoulder seasons, respectively. It is notable that, for all the seasons, the largest saving rate is from the boiler. Accordingly, the boiler consumption to the overall energy consumption dropped throughout the heating (53.0% to 43.6%), cooling (20.1% to 0%), and shoulder (34.3% to 0.4%) periods (see Fig. 12 ). From these results, it can be inferred that the OC focuses on minimizing the heating energy consumption of the overall system, whereas the RBC requires redundant heating. It implies that, for the RBC, a significant amount of reheating is required in the DOAS level as the air is cooled down to 9 ℃ for the dehumidification purpose. It is noteworthy that, in the cooling and shoulder seasons, almost no heating may be needed unless the supply air needs are set to a specific temperature (Table 6 and Table 7). The energy cost and consumption saving rates in subsequent tables (i.e., Table 4, Table 5, Table 6, and Table 7) are calculated based on Eq. (6) and Eq. (7), respectively. (6) S a v i n g r a t e ( E n e r g y c o s t ) = ( C RBC - C OC ) C RBC × 100 [ % ] Where C RBC is energy cost of the rule-based control and C OC is energy cost of the optimal control. (7) S a v i n g r a t e ( E n e r g y c o n s u m p t i o n ) = ( E RBC - E OC ) E RBC × 100 [ % ] Where E RBC is energy consumption of the rule-based control and E OC is energy consumption of the optimal control. While achieving the high energy performance, in terms of energy cost and consumption, the indoor air temperatures are well-maintained within the thermostat setpoint and setback boundaries (Table 1). The total unmet load hours for the cases with optimal control was 33 h, and this satisfies the criterion set by ASHRAE Standard 90.1\u20132019 [36], which recommends the building energy models shall have unmet load hours of less than 300 h in one year. Since our simulation run for approximately three months (i.e., a quarter of a year), it should be considered adequate if the unmet load hour is less than 75 h (i.e., a quarter of 300 h). 3.2 Rule extraction for DOAS supply air temperature control Regardless of the optimal control\u2019s outstanding performance, running optimizations for every timestep is complex and time consuming. Also, the relationship between the environmental factors (e.g., day and time, outdoor air conditions, number of occupants, etc.) and the optimal supply air temperature is difficult to be interpreted. This complexity and lack of interpretability prohibits this optimal control to be implemented in practice. In this regard, this study aims to extract simple rules out of the optimal values not only to pursue the high energy efficiency, but also for the control logics to be easily interpretable and implementable. For effective optimization-informed rule extraction (OIRE)-based control implementation, it is important to develop rules that are simple to understand while maintaining the performance. For this purpose, the maximum depth of the decision tree model has been arbitrarily limited to four, assuming that it is difficult to interpret when the trees have the depths over five. Within this restriction, the best performing tree, in terms of simulating the OC, has been developed using a grid search. For the case study, outdoor air conditions (i.e., air temperature and relative humidity) and number of occupants are considered as inputs for the decision tree to predict the optimal supply air temperature (Table 8 ). The outdoor air temperature and relative humidity are chosen as inputs as they are major factors influencing the sensible and latent loads [60]. The number of occupants is also regarded as an input factor because the occupants not only generate internal heat gains themselves, but are also closely associated with other sources of heat gain such as lighting and plug loads [61]. The total data set (i.e., all hourly data for the optimization periods listed in Table 3) was split into training and testing data with the test data accounting for approximately 20% of the total. The training data was used for building a decision tree and the testing data was used to evaluate the rules that were extracted from the decision tree. Table 9 details the training and testing data for the heating, cooling, and shoulder seasons. The training data for each season were aggregated to train one tree, and accordingly, all the testing data were evaluated with the same tree. Fig. 13 depicts the decision tree that is built based on the training data. The decision nodes are structured by the inputs, including outdoor air dry-bulb temperature (OADT), outdoor air relative humidity (OARH), and total number of the people (NP_All) in the target zones. This tree, in turn, can be interpreted with simple rules. For instance, the far-left branch of the tree indicates that the DOAS supply air temperature setpoint shall be 9.1 ℃ if the OADT is equal to or less than -8.9 ℃. The far-right branch states that the supply air temperature should be raised to 11.3 ℃ when the OADT is higher than 13.3 ℃ and the OARH is higher than 67.9% with more than 80 occupants in the zones. Likely, the rules extracted from a decision tree can be articulated in English language, which means that they are interpretable. This interpretability enables the control logic to simply be programed to building control system. Fig. 14 details the simple \u2018if-then-else\u2019 rules extracted from the decision tree in Fig. 13. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the \u2018if-then-else\u2019 rules developed by OIRE, this study adopted the EnergyPlus Energy Management System (EMS), which allows custom system control logic to be programmed and simulated. The OIRE is compared with the typical rule-based control (RBC) and the optimal control (OC) shown in terms of energy cost and energy consumption. Fig. 15 represents the supply air temperatures controlled by the RBC, OC, and OIRE in the test period of the heating, cooling, and shoulder seasons. The solid pink, orange, and sky-blue lines represent the supply air temperatures by RBC, OC, and OIRE, respectively. The gray shades in the figure represent unoccupied, or unconditioned hours. It is notable that the OC and the OIRE maintain lower supply air temperatures compared with the RBC regardless of the seasons. More importantly, it can be found that the supply air temperature control by the OIRE is highly aligned with that of the OC. The mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) in between the OIRE and OC are approximately 0.2 ℃ and 0.3 ℃, respectively, which means that the simple \u2018if-then-else\u2019 rules described in Fig. 14 can accurately predict the optimal control. The MSE and MAE are computed as follows (Eq. (8) and Eq. (9)). (8) MSE = ∑ i = 1 n y i - y ^ i 2 n (9) MAE = ∑ i = 1 n y i - y ^ i n Where y i is the ground truth value, which in this case is the OC result, and the y ^ i is the predicted value, which in this case is the OIRE result. n represents the total number of data points. Table 10 and Table 11 detail the energy costs and energy consumptions for each control strategy. The results show that the energy costs and consumptions of OIRE are comparable to those of the OC and significantly lower than those of the RBC. It is expected that approximately 15%, 6%, 20% of energy cost could be saved in cooling, heating, and shoulder seasons, respectively (Table 10). Similarly, the amount of energy used during the cooling, heating, and shoulder seasons could be reduced by about 28%, 12%, and 40%, respectively (Table 11). However, compared to the OC, the OIRE only costs slightly more (i.e., less than 1%) while consuming about 2% more energy. This suggests that, with far less complexity, the rules developed via OIRE can be as effective as the global optimal control sequence (i.e., OC). Similar to the optimal control, the largest portion of energy saving of OIRE-based control came from boiler usage (Table 12 , Table 13 , Table 14 , and Fig. 16 ). From the results, it is expected a significant heating energy could be reduced by adopting the OIRE instead of the RBC under the given circumstances. The expected energy consumption saving rate when implementing OIRE-based control instead of RBC was computed using Eq. (10). (10) Saving rate E n e r g y c o n s u m p t i o n = E RBC - E OIRE E RBC × 100 % Where E OIRE is energy consumption of the OIRE-based control. Lastly, in addition to the energy analysis, spot checks on the zone air temperature were conducted. Fig. 17 depicts the validation of zone air temperatures for the corner classroom 1 (CC 1) according to RBC, OC, and OIRE. The solid pink, orange, and sky-blue lines represent the CC 1 zone air temperature in response to RBC, OC, and OIRE, respectively. The dashed red and green lines are the predetermined lower and upper bounds, which are zone heating and cooling setpoint temperature, respectively. The zone air temperature is well-maintained within the lower and upper bounds during the occupied hours, where the lower and upper bounds represent the heating and cooling setpoint temperature, respectively. It implies that the OIRE has potential to operate the DOAS in an energy-efficient way without violating occupants comfort level, in term of the levels of indoor thermal condition. 4 Conclusions This study focuses on an approach for developing optimization-informed rule extraction (OIRE)-based dedicated outdoor air system (DOAS) supply air temperature control sequence. The optimal control (OC) solutions generated by Genetic Algorithm (GA) were transferred to simple \u2018if-then-else\u2019 rules using the proposed OIRE. Using Decision Tree (DT), the OIRE mimicked OC accurately with a mean squared error of 0.2 ℃. As a result, the OIRE reduced approximately 15%, 6%, and 20% of energy cost and 28%, 12%, and 40% in cooling, heating, and shoulder months, respectively, compared to the typical rule-based control (RBC). The energy savings were mostly accomplished through lowering the heating energy consumption. Also, by adopting the OIRE, the zone air temperature could be well-maintained within the predetermined heating and cooling setpoint temperatures. 5 Discussion, limitation and future work Applying advanced controls (e.g., optimal control) for HVAC systems in buildings has gained increasing focus according to its superior energy-saving potential. However, the interpretability of such controls remains an unsolved issue and this prohibits the building operators from implementing the controls in practice. This case study of OIRE-based DOAS control in this paper aims to suggest a potent way of bridging the gap between the two, by improving both the energy-saving potential and the interpretability. Yet, the following limitations still remain, and potential future work are identified accordingly. ● First, the observations for this optimization-informed rule extraction-based control are limited to one building type with one DOAS configuration (i.e., Primary school equipped with DOAS and variable speed four-pipe fan coils) in one climate zone (i.e., New York City, 4A). The near future work includes applying the proposed method for different representative climate zones and system configurations. The extracted rules will be further scaled and categorized for different use cases. Furthermore, the EnergyPlus models for DOAS with different system configurations, and codes for optimization and rule extraction could be available upon the reader\u2019s request or open source. ● Secondly, the study presented in this paper is limited to a simulation-based study, which suggests some further experiments for implementing and validating the proposed optimization-informed rule extraction-based control in existing DOAS systems. This would also highlight the potential performance gap between the simulation model and real world applications that could be caused by multiple uncertain sources and assumptions for the simulation (e.g., occupant behavior, internal/plug loads, etc.) [62]. ● Thirdly, the main optimization objective in this study is the minimization of operational energy cost. As highlighted above in Section 1.1, one of the largest benefits of adopting dedicated outdoor air systems in buildings is having a variety of options for selecting terminal units for space heating and cooling. For instance, having radiant systems connected to electric heat pumps along with the DOAS can promote the energy-efficiency and decarbonization, which in turn would be a potential solution for reducing CO2 emissions, as well. Our ongoing and future work will have carbon-emission reduction as one of the evaluation metrics. ● Last but not least, different methodologies for optimization and rule extraction could be explored. This study adopted Genetic Algorithm and Decision Tree for optimization and rule extraction, respectively. Nevertheless, for factors such as model configuration and availability of inputs for rule extractions, the optimization and rule extraction algorithms may need to be further adjusted. Thus, it could be advantageous to investigate and compare various optimization (e.g., gradient-based optimization, reinforcement learning) and rule extraction (e.g., fuzzy logic) technologies.

        "dc:description": "In the era of post-Coronavirus Disease 2019, the dedicated outdoor air system (DOAS), which provides 100% outdoor air for the building, is widely acknowledged as it can ensure acceptable indoor air quality by delivering fresh outdoor air to occupied space. The DOAS with a proper design and operation can provide sufficient ventilation and dehumidification while achieving energy efficiency. Nonetheless, there is limited guidance in determining the optimal control sequence of the DOAS for the designers and operators to implement in practice. Accordingly, in practice, a number of issues have been acknowledged in the design and control phases of DOAS, including insufficient ventilation and dehumidification, and increasing supply air dry-bulb temperature in fear of over-cooling, which might cause significant discomfort and energy waste. There have been efforts to develop high-performing DOAS controls for better energy efficiency. However, such controls are often complex, or difficult to interpret, for building designers and operators to consider in practice. In this regard, this paper explores a simulation-based framework for generating a supply air temperature control sequence of the DOAS not only to ensure improved energy-saving potential but also to guarantee the implement-ability of the control logic. The U.S. Department of Energy prototype primary school with dynamic occupancy profiles was modeled with a whole building simulation program, EnergyPlus. The model consists of a DOAS with an exhaust air energy recovery system for ventilation and fan-coil units for space cooling and heating. Then, a Genetic Algorithm was adopted to find the true optimal supply air temperature control sequence in terms of minimizing the energy cost of the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system operation. Lastly, Decision Tree was adopted to extract rules out of the optimums to derive an implementable sequence of operation for the DOAS supply air temperature. A total of 12 week-simulation including four weeks of heating, cooling, and shoulder seasons, separately, under the weather condition of New York City was conducted for the case study. This case study identified that the optimization-informed rule extraction-based control, when compared to conventional outdoor air temperature-based reset control, could save about 13% of energy cost and 25% of energy consumption throughout the heating, cooling, and shoulder seasons. It is notable that the energy-saving was mainly achieved by reducing the heating energy consumption. Importantly, it nearly corresponds to the true optimal control result, which reduces approximately 14% of energy cost and 27% of energy consumption. From the results, it can be highlighted that the optimization-informed rule extraction can be as energy effective as the optimal control, while significantly reducing the complexity of the control.",
