Actively controlling a building\u2019s heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system can reduce costs and improve indoor comfort. Model predictive control (MPC) is an effective control algorithm that can facilitate the active control of complex systems such as the HVAC system. However, the uncertainty of the prediction model engenders many challenges in practical application. To address these issues, we propose a tube-based MPC strategy. First, a reduced-order thermal capacitance and thermal resistance model is established for the target system. Subsequently, a tube-based MPC scheme is designed to effectively handle uncertainties in real systems. The prediction uncertainty space is re-assumed in the tube, combined with the actual prediction error, to more closely correspond to the actual situation. The proposed model is tested and validated using the BOPTEST open-source testing framework. The results show that the proposed tube-based MPC can reduce the operating cost by at least 24%, compared with the traditional open-loop and closed-loop MPC, and can better control the indoor temperature when considering multiple uncertain predictions.

Of the total energy consumption in society, buildings account for approximately 40% [3,4]. More workforce is required in buildings to optimize the indoor environment and meet the needs of occupant comfort [5]. Further, heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems are a crucial part of indoor environments and account for a significant portion of building energy consumption [6]. Therefore, achieving optimal energy efficiency without compromising occupant comfort requirements is vital [7]. In this respect, efforts to develop effective real-time management strategies for HVAC have been highlighted to realize energy-saving goals in the building sector [8]. However, minimizing HVAC consumption while satisfying occupant comfort requirements requires advanced algorithms. An optimization algorithm must balance the relationship between different optimization objectives [9\u201311], particularly in consideration of dynamic energy price systems [12]. Multiple conflicting optimization goals can be integrated in the model predictive control (MPC) to ensure an optimal trade-off among these conflicting optimization goals [13,14]. Recent studies have shown that algorithms that maximize models and predictions, such as MPC, can achieve better results than traditional control algorithms such as PI control [15,16]. The MPC is an advanced form of process control strategy and a promising candidate for smart buildings, efficient control, higher energy saving, and better indoor environments [17]. However, application to HVAC systems require more research on practical issues such as the establishment of a system dynamic model and dealing with disturbances caused by prediction uncertainty (e.g., ambient temperature, solar radiation, and other weather-related disturbances) [18]. These uncertainties reduce the effectiveness of the MPC in the actual process and increase the complexity of the entire optimization problem [19]. 1.2 Literature review on MPC The MPC is a model-based controller that controls the input of a dynamic model to obtain an optimal control strategy within a finite window [20]. With advances in computer technology, the MPC has been applied to building energy control for various goals such as energy cost minimization [21] and indoor comfort [22]. Bird et al. used the MPC algorithm to control the temperature setpoint of an HVAC system in a real commercial building (with 7800 m 2 total floor area), and saved 240 dollars in two months [23]. David et al. tested the effect of the MPC algorithm on an HVAC system in a real office building in the United States and achieved approximately 40% energy savings during the two-month test period [24]. Freund et al. successfully implemented the Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm in a large building, demonstrating its potential for energy savings. Over a three-month test period, the team achieved a remarkable reduction in heating energy consumption, achieving savings of up to 75% [25]. Thieblemont extensively reviewed MPC application cases in real buildings and revealed that the application of the MPC could increase energy efficiency by 10%\u201330% and improve the indoor comfort of occupants [26]. However, several challenges hinder the large-scale implementation of MPC in buildings. One of these challenges is forecast uncertainty. MPCs are built based on forecasts, and many scholars consider them to be perfect weather forecasters. However, all predictions have uncertainties that may affect system performance [27]. Oldewurtel et al. found that the result of the temperature prediction significantly affected the control effect of MPC [28]. According to Hedegaard et al. MPC may be 4% less effective in reducing heating costs owing to forecast uncertainty [29]. Nevertheless, the application of MPC in HVAC systems needs to fully consider the uncertainty of the prediction model, particularly the outdoor air temperature prediction and solar radiation, to obtain a robust control strategy under the consideration of uncertainty. 1.3 Addressing uncertainty in MPC and HVAC In buildings HVAC systems, accurate modeling cannot be achieved owing to model variance or interfering factors. Disturbance factors are exogenous and generally originate from the heating load, outdoor temperature, solar irradiance, and occupancy rate [16]. Currently, the methods for addressing uncertainty mainly include robust MPC (RMPC) [30] and stochastic MPC (SMPC) [31]. Nagpal et al. used RMPC to control the HVAC system in the presence of parameter uncertainty. Even in the presence of significant disturbance factors, the control algorithm successfully maintained the indoor temperature of the building within the desired range [30]. Yang et al. used an adaptive RMPC algorithm to address uncertainties in the HVAC system control. As indicated by the results, the proposed algorithm effectively saved energy by approximately 15% more than a simple control, even when the prediction uncertainty was as high as 60% [32]. Sawant applied the RMPC scheme to variable air volume area temperature control and demonstrated that the RMPC scheme enhanced robustness without requiring extensive user intervention and effectively handled uncertainties such as cooling load variability [33]. However, RMPC methods consider the bounds of the disturbance and ignore the uncertainty of real prediction results. Algorithms must consider worst-case scenarios that rarely occur in practice. However, constraints in such extreme cases can drastically reduce the effectiveness of control strategies [34]. The SMPC is considered an alternative to the RMPC. It considers the probabilistic nature of uncertainty and provides additional information on it. Furthermore, unlike the RMPC, it does not consider unlikely worst-case scenarios. Rather, it considers possible uncertain situations in practice [35]. Lee et al. performed a randomized MPC experiment using occupancy and weather forecasts for campus buildings, the study revealed that the controller achieved approximately 6%\u201325% energy-savings [36]. In [37], a Markov chain model was utilized to predict the behavior of an SMPC, resulting in 40% energy savings, compared to a PID controller. In summary, the SMPC scheme is relatively complicated, and is basically implemented by approximating and resolving uncertainties, which also increases the burden of the calculation process [38]. 1.4 Contribution of this study After reviewing the literature, the authors found that the prediction uncertainty in MPC significantly affects the final control effect of the HVAC system. Therefore, the existence of prediction uncertainty must be fully considered in actual situations. However, there are still some challenges in applying MPC and prediction uncertainty to the optimal control of HVAC systems, which have not been adequately addressed in existing studies. \u2022 To implement effective control, the MPC must accurately predict HVAC system parameters. However, majority of prior studies were based on the assumption that prediction was 100% accurate, which does not reflect practical applications. \u2022 The RMPC obtains better results under extreme prediction conditions, compared to the traditional MPC. However, it sacrifices its own optimization performance, because the assumed extreme conditions are unlikely to be generated in the actual process. \u2022 The SMPC can assume real prediction uncertainty with greater accuracy. However, the entire process of the algorithm is more complicated, and the approximation of uncertainty will significantly increase the computational load. To address the above challenges, tube-based MPC is considered as a potential robust optimization framework [39]. The tube-based MPC was first proposed in 2005 and verified in a linear system [40]. It has proven to be able to achieve convergence in linear systems and provide very good robust control over the influence of uncertainty. With the development of computer technology, this algorithm has been increasingly applied in many other fields and nonlinear systems [41], which is beneficial for load control [42] and robot movement [43]. This paper modifies the assumption of uncertainty space on the basis of tube-based MPC, and verifies the algorithm with more prediction scenarios. The proposed strategy can effectively mitigate the effects of uncertainties in practical applications. Further, through the strategy, HVAC temperature and air volume can be determined to minimize energy consumption while maintaining the trajectory of the indoor temperature in the presence of uncertainty. This study fills a key research gap in the MPC algorithms, namely, how to account for the impact of prediction uncertainty on optimization strategies. In this study, a tube-based MPC scheme was designed to address uncertainties in real systems. The control scheme can mitigate the effects of uncertainties in real systems and achieve order control performance. Currently, there remains a dearth of research on the utilization of tube-based MPC in regulating HVAC systems\u2019 operational management. Only ref [39] and ref [44] used tube MPC for HVAC system control. However, the authors discovered that both studies contained only one piece of uncertainty data. Such results may not truly reflect the advantages of the tube MPC algorithm. Finally, considering the error distribution of time series multi-step forecasting in the real process, we modified and improved the tube in the tube MPC algorithm to more accurately reflect the forecast uncertainty in practical situations. 2 Improved tube-based MPC In this section, we first describe the concept and algorithm of the traditional MPC. Subsequently, based on the defined objectives, we proposed an improved tube-based MPC for the robust control of HVAC systems. 2.1 Conventional MPC for HVAC system The MPC is an optimal control algorithm. The dynamic model of the controlled object and the current measurement state can be obtained by identifying the best action strategy within a limited timeframe. This is achieved by calculating the trajectory of the object\u2019s future state within the optimization window period. At each sampling instant, the online MPC computes the future sequence of control actions and only implements the first action in the sequence. The presence of predictive data enables the MPC to incorporate future information into control problems for improved performance. Considering the problem of HVAC systems, the objective function is the operating cost of the entire system and the difference between the indoor temperature and target. The determined control strategy must ensure that the operating cost of the system is minimal and the indoor temperature is as close to the target set as possible. In general, an MPC problem can be expressed as (1) min u n , u n + 1 , \u2026 , u m ∑ k = n n + m − 1 O b j x ˜ k , u k subject to (2) x ˜ k + 1 = f x ˜ k , u k , k = n , n + 1 , \u2026 , n + m − 1 (3) x ˜ n = x i n i t i a l n (4) u k ∈ U , k = n , n + 1 , \u2026 , n + m − 1 (5) x ˜ k ∈ X , k = n , n + 1 , \u2026 , n + m where x ˜ k is the predicted state variable at the time step t k and u k is the corresponding control variables. Eq. (1) indicates the objective function of MPC. The objective function is a function of the state and control variables in the forecast window. Eq. (2) represents the dynamic in HVAC model, which includes the prediction of outdoor air temperature and different changes in the indoor temperature caused by different control actions. Eq. (3) is the formula for the initialization state of the entire MPC. The initialization method in Eq. (3) also determines the different types of the entire MPC algorithm. An MPC in which the predicted state value from the previous step is used for initialization is called an open-loop MPC [45]. Conversely, the MPC is referred to as closed-loop if the current measured value is used as the initialization state of the model [46]. The last Eq. (4) and (5) represent the constraints on the control variables and state variables in the actual situation, respectively. The basic flow of the MPC is shown in Fig. 1. 2.2 Uncertainties and improved tube-based MPC In actual scenarios, non-negligible uncertainties or disturbances are probable in real systems [47]. The dynamic formulation of the HVAC system considering the uncertainties is given by (Eq. (6)): (6) x ˜ k + 1 = f x ˜ k , u k + ɛ , k = n , n + 1 , \u2026 , n + N p − 1 where ɛ indicates the unknown bounded uncertainties comparing with Eq. (2). In an HVAC system, outdoor temperature and solar radiation intensity forecasts are all possible uncertain factors. However, both temperature and solar radiation have specific ranges of values and are thus bounded. In general, the main purpose of tube-based MPC is to bring the trajectory of the actual uncertainty situation as close as possible to the nominal one. Therefore, tube-based MPC consists of two consecutive MPC controllers: a nominal MPC with strict constraints, which is used to generate a central path, and an ancillary MPC with original system constraints that attempts to integrate the uncertain system trajectories and guide the central path. A detailed description of the two controllers is provided as follows. \u2022 Nominal MPC: The optimization objective of the nominal MPC is the same as that of the traditional MPC. However, it has two main features, which are not present in the traditional MPC. The first is that the nominal MPC is a complete open-loop MPC, that is, the initial state in each step of the optimization process adopts the state predicted in the previous time step. Second, the nominal MPC tightens the constraints of the original problem, that is, the states and inputs of the nominal MPC are a subset of the actual system. Taking HVAC system control as an example, assume that the original HVAC has a temperature adjustment control action, and its control range is from 15 °C to 35 °C. In the nominal MPC problem, the constraints of the control problem will be tightened, for example, to 18 °C to 32 °C. Here, to distinguish the nominal MPC from the conventional MPC, we used z and v to denote the nominal MPC about the state and action vectors. The nominal MPC is shown below (Eq. (7) to Eq. (11)): (7) min u n , u n + 1 , \u2026 , u m ∑ k = n n + m − 1 O b j z ˜ k , v k subject to (8) z ˜ k + 1 = f z ˜ k , v k , k = n , n + 1 , \u2026 , n + m − 1 (9) z ˜ n = z i n i t i a l n (10) v k ∈ V , k = n , n + 1 , \u2026 , n + m − 1 (11) z ˜ k ∈ Z , k = n , n + 1 , \u2026 , n + m where Z and V denote the tightened state and action constraints. That is, Z and V are a subset of the original constraints. \u2022 ancillary MPC: The role of the ancillary MPC is to guide the actual uncertain system into the target trajectory of the nominal MPC. Therefore, the ancillary MPC ought to produce a sequence of actions and states in the HVAC system that is as close as possible to the result of the nominal MPC. Furthermore, the constraints of the ancillary MPC should be the same as those of the regular MPC without any tightening. The optimization problem of the ancillary MPC is formulated as follows: (12) min u n , u n + 1 , \u2026 , u n + m − 1 ∑ k = n n + m − 1 λ x ˜ k + 1 − z ˜ k + 1 2 + ξ u k − v k 2 subject to Eq. (2) to Eq. (5) Eq. (12) ensures that the output and control input of the ancillary MPC follow the calculation result of the nominal MPC. λ and ξ correspond to the weights of the output and input of the controller, respectively. In general, λ is set to be larger than ξ to preferentially track the output generated by the nominal MPC over the control input. The two parts of the tube-based MPC algorithm have been introduced above. However, before summarizing the algorithm flow, we need to further consider the application of the uncertainty space in the tube. Tube-based MPC are still rarely used in HVAC systems, and existing studies are based on the assumption that the entire uncertainty space is a regular cylinder [39]. However, this assumption is not accurate in the application context of the HVAC system control. Taking the outdoor temperature prediction as an example, for the outdoor temperature within a certain window in the future, as the time step is decommissioned, the prediction accuracy should also gradually decrease [48]. Therefore, in the application of the HVAC system, the authors believe that the previous tube-based MPC does not make sufficient assumptions regarding the uncertainty space. It is assumed in this study that the degree of the uncertainty space gradually increases as the time step progresses within the prediction window but remains a bounded uncertainty space. Thus, the original cylindrical uncertainty space becomes circular frustum, as shown in Fig. 2, T n + m predicts that the area generated by the uncertainty space will be larger than T n . Fig. 2 shows the tube-based MPC within 2 time steps, which means that at each time step we will generate an uncertainty space with the same assumptions. The dashed lines in the figure indicate the resulting uncertainty space. Finally, Fig. 3 summarizes the algorithm flow of the tube-based MPC. 3 Case study for improved tube-based MPC 3.1 Introduction to target HVAC system To verify the effectiveness of the proposed tube-based MPC algorithm, the authors used an open-source testing framework called BOPTEST to test the algorithm [49]. The best air from BOPTEST was used as the target for our case study. The building is a single room based on the BESTEST Case 900 model definition, located near Denver, CO, USA. The floor area is 48 m 2 . There are four exterior walls facing the cardinal directions and a flat roof. The south wall has two 6- m 2 windows. The building is used in a two-person office with a light load density [50]. The building uses ideal four-pipe fan coil units to provide heating and cooling to the offices. More details about the case studies can be found on the reference webpage [50]. Our control of the HVAC system includes controlling the supply air temperature (12 °C\u201340 °C) and normalizing the air mass flow rate to the design air mass flow rate (0\u20131). 3.2 Resistor\u2013capacitor (RC) model for target system The MPC is a model-based controller and thus requires an accurate system model to obtain effective calculations of the system state. There are many technologically mature software packages, such as EnergyPlus [51] and TRNSYS [52], for the simulation and calculation of building-side HVAC systems. However, the calculation of these software packages is usually time-consuming, and when an external solver is introduced, the simulation software is equivalent to a black box model, which cannot be optimized or solved [53]. As an alternative, an RC model based on heat and charge diffusion was used for the implementation of the MPC algorithm [54]. These models have low computational complexity and have shown useful performance, both theoretically and practically. However, the error was relatively large. In this study, owing to the need to introduce an external optimizer, the RC model was used as the calculation method for the MPC framework. In the RC network model, a building is modeled as a network, with nodes indicating walls or rooms. Each thermal zone of a building is developed using a lumped resistance and capacitance approach, including the internal thermal mass, indoor air, building envelope and outdoor environment, and heat exchange. Consider the example of a simple building represented by a 2R2C, as shown in Fig. 4. The equations for this model are as follows. (13) C i d T i = 1 R i T e − T i d t + Φ h d t + A i Φ s d t + T o − T i ∗ 0 . 5 ∗ V d t + T a c − T i ∗ m a c ∗ ρ a i r d t (14) C e d T e = 1 R i T i − T e d t + 1 R o T o − T e d t + A e Φ s d t where T i , T e , and T o represent the indoor, building envelope, and outdoor air temperatures, respectively. For simplicity, all the walls and ceilings are considered as a unified whole. Φ h ( W ) is the indoor heating power generated by humans and equipment; Φ s ( W/m 2 ) indicates the global horizontal solar irradiance; The thermal resistance R i (in units of K/W) denotes the resistance between the indoor air temperature and the building envelope, while R o (also in units of K/W) refers to the resistance between the envelope and the ambient air. The heat capacitances of the interior and the envelope are indicated as C i ( J/K ) and C e ( J/K ) . A i and A e ( m 2 ) are the indoor and envelope solar-gain coefficients, respectively. In Eq. (13), 0.5 represents the natural infiltration coefficient of the building, this value can be validated through the BOPTEST test case regarding the \u2019bestest air\u2019 case [50]. V represents the volume of the entire building. T a c and m a c indicate two actions controlled by the HVAC system, which are the temperature of the air-conditioning supply air and the mass flow rate of the air supply. After determining the structure of the RC model, we used the RC model to interact with BOPTEST and obtained all the parameters in the RC model using the least squares method. We used the seven-day data (Day 334 to Day 340, 15 mins per step) for the parameter fitting of the model to determine the parameters of the RC model. The RC model obtained for a period of three days was used for verification from the 341st day to the 344th day. During the validation process, we randomly generated the supply air temperature and mass flow of the HVAC system. In our case study, the supply air temperature uniformly generates integers ranging from 12 to 40 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the mass flow serves as a control signal, and uniformly generates decimal numbers ranging from 0 to 1, while retaining one decimal place precision. Specifically, this ranges from 0 to 1, in increments of 0.1, resulting in a total of 11 possible values for the mass flow. The visual verification results are presented in Fig. 5. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of the RC and BOPTEST calculation results, as shown in the figure, is 15.26%. Table 1 lists the detailed parameters of the RC model. 3.3 RMPC of target system 3.3.1 Operational cost consumption The main objective of this study was to make the indoor temperature as close as possible to the set temperature while minimizing the operational cost of the ventilation system. Therefore, we must consider the total energy consumption of the HVAC system and the total electricity price at different moments. The HVAC system energy consumption can be divided into two parts. The first is the energy consumed by the system to change the air temperature. Eq. (15) gives the calculation method of the energy consumption which is constructed with reference to the comments in the BOPTEST code library [49]. (15) E 1 = T s e t − T in C O P ∗ ρ a i r ∗ q i where T s e t is the temperature setting of the HVAC system, T i n is the indoor air temperature (°C), q i ( kg/s ) is the mass flow rate of the HVAC system supply air, ρ a i r is the air density, which was 1005 g/m 3 in this case. The COP represents the coefficient of performance of the HVAC system, which is constant at 3 and 0.9 for cooling and heating, respectively. For more detailed instructions, readers may refer to \u2019bestest air\u2019 case study in BOPTEST, the setting value of the heating COP here comes from the efficiency of the gas boiler while the cooling COP is directly in the document [50]. The second part of the energy was consumed by the blower fan. For calculation accuracy, the authors directly performed function fitting on the relationship between the fan mass flow signal and power consumption in the BOPTEST simulation framework. The calculation method for the fitted quadratic function is given by Eq. (16). (16) E 2 = 258 . 39 ∗ f a n s i g n a l 2 − 97 . 843 ∗ f a n s i g n a l + 6 . 1739 Based on this, the total operating cost of the HVAC system at time step t is expressed by Eq. (17): (17) E [ t ] = ( E 1 [ t ] + E 2 [ t ] ) ∗ p r i c e [ t ] ∗ Δ t where t denotes the t th interval, that is, time step t to time step t + 1 , and the dynamic power price is based on the day-ahead energy prices (LMP), as determined in the Southwest Power Pool wholesale electricity market for Node LAM345 in 2018. This information was automatically included in the BOPTEST framework, and the figure below shows the electricity price changes in the case study (Fig. 6). 3.3.2 Temperature controlling cost In this study, in addition to reducing the energy consumption of the HVAC, controlling the indoor air temperature is an important goal in the entire control process. The objective function setting of indoor air temperature is relatively simple. The absolute value of the difference between the controlled indoor temperature and the setpoint temperature can be directly calculated using the following equation (Eq. (18)): (18) I n d o o r [ t ] = | T m e a s u r e [ t ] − T s e t p o i n t [ t ] | where T m e a s u r e is the measured sensor data from BOPTEST in time step t , T s e t p o i n t is the control target for indoor environment. As described in the following section, the indoor temperature control objective function and running cost function were included in the objective function for the calculation. 3.3.3 Tube-based MPC algorithm process We formulated the problem of RMPC for the operational control of HVAC systems using the above calculations and framework. The overall goal was to maintain a specified set temperature for an indoor environment while minimizing the operating costs. The tube-based MPC consists of two MPCs: nominal MPC and ancillary MPC. To distinguish the variables in both MPCs, the associated variables of the nominal MPC are superscripted with n o r . First, the nominal MPC was designed using the same objective function as that of the traditional MPC optimization framework, that is, minimizing the difference in temperature control and operating cost, as shown in Eq. (19). (19) min ∑ t = n n + m − 1 α E [ t ] + I n d o o r [ t ] where E [ t ] and I n d o o r [ t ] are calculated using Eqs. (17) and (18), respectively. α indicates the weighting coefficient between the operating cost and indoor temperature control, which is used to weigh the relationship between the two optimization objectives. In this study, after the experiment, we set the value of α at 0.1. During the experiment, we observed that the operating cost calculated by Eq. (17) had a relatively large absolute value. To balance the objectives of temperature control and operating cost in the MPC algorithm, we introduced a coefficient of 0.1 to scale the operating cost. By doing so, the algorithm could simultaneously optimize for both objectives. Notably, this coefficient can be customized to achieve different optimization goals in various practical applications. All experiments in this paper are compared under the same weight setting. The constraints of the nominal MPC mainly include the constraints of the RC model, that is, Eqs. (13) and (14). In addition, for the nominal MPC, the constraints on the upper and lower bounds of variables was tightened to meet the algorithm requirements. These constraints can be expressed as follows: (20) T set ( n o r ) − min ≤ T set ( n o r ) [ t ] ≤ T set ( n o r ) − max , ∀ t (21) F a n set ( n o r ) − min ≤ F a n set ( n o r ) [ t ] ≤ F a n set ( n o r ) − max , ∀ t where T set ( n o r ) − min and T set ( n o r ) − max indicate the tightening of the nominal MPC for temperature control actions. The action constraints range in nominal MPC should be a subset of the original action space (12 °C to 40 °C), F a n set ( n o r ) − min , and F a n set ( n o r ) − max indicate the degree of tightening of the air supply action (original action space is 0 to 1). Finally, we defined the objective function of the ancillary MPC, as shown in Eq. (22) (22) min ∑ t = n n + m − 1 λ T i n [ t + 1 ] − T i n ( n o r ) [ t + 1 ] 2 + ξ T s e t [ t ] − T s e t ( n o r ) [ t ] 2 + δ F a n s e t [ t ] − F a n s e t ( n o r ) [ t ] 2 where λ , ξ , and δ indicate the status (indoor air temperature) and control variables (temperature setting and fan control signal as air mass flow rate normalized to the design air mass flow rate). This function computes actions and states such that they are as close as possible to the nominal MPC. Previous research on tube-based MPC has typically focused more on the control state than the control action when designing the objective function for ancillary MPC. In the case of this paper, λ should be greater than ξ and δ [44]. However, the authors conducted testing and found that the optimization effect was not satisfactory. This was due to the control of the fan being a dimensionless number ranging from 0 to 1, and its absolute value being small. Consequently, the fan action control was being overlooked during optimization. To address this issue, the authors scaled down the weights of state control and temperature control in the model. This was done to ensure that the fan action control was not ignored in the ancillary MPC. Considering those factors, we set λ , ξ , and δ as 0.1, 0.1, and 1. The constraints of the ancillary MPC are the same as those of the original problem without the tightened constraints of the nominal MPC. 4 Validation and results 4.1 Experiment settings The ultimate aim of this research was to address the practical control problem of HVAC systems under prediction uncertainty. BOPTEST can be used to simulate the real situation of an actual building. According to the different scenarios set by BOPTEST itself, the official document designates the period from the 334th day to the 348th day as the peak heat period. We selected 341 days (peak heat day) as our optimization goal, and the control time step was 15 min [50]. The HVAC system must be controlled during this time of day to satisfy the objective function. We aimed to maintain the room temperature at 15 °C when the room is empty, and 21 °C when there are people. It is worth noting that the target temperature may vary in practice depending on factors such as the number of people present and the time of day. However, as BOPTEST does not provide relevant information on this matter, we have determined a target temperature of 21 °C based on the related needs of the experiment. To better verify the effect of the proposed tube-based MPC algorithm, we aimed to design and compare three different types of MPC algorithms in the experiment. \u2022 M.1 (open-loop MPC): In the open-loop MPC algorithm, the calculation of each step depends on the calculation result of the previous step. Thus, in the entire algorithm process, the open-loop MPC does not have any interaction with the BOPTEST algorithm during the calculation process. The calculation of the entire algorithm completely depended on the prediction data and RC model provided by us. The open-loop MPC is ideal in situations where the state of the room temperature is unobtainable. Considering the accuracy of measuring instruments and the limitation of information transmission technology, the open-loop MPC still has certain application value. The authors took open-loop MPC as the baseline model of MPC control and introduced it into the experiment for comparison. However, the open-loop algorithm also completely ignores the existence of uncertainty. \u2022 M.2 (closed-loop MPC): Compared with the open-loop MPC, closed-loop MPC can obtain measured values at each time step for initialization. Therefore, the controller will obtain the current measured value in time during each optimization step as the initial value of the next optimization window. In terms of the remaining constraints and objective functions, the closed- and open-loop MPC are identical. Notably, traditional MPC based on the closed-loop structure considers uncertainty indirectly by measuring the state of the uncertain system and using the measured state as the initial condition for the optimization of the next time interval. Fig. 7 summarizes the differences and connections between closed- and open-loop MPC. \u2022 M.3 (tube-based MPC): In this study, the optimization model proposed for implementing the robust operation control of the HVAC system is the tube-based MPC. The details and content of the algorithm have been explained in the preamble. In terms of information volume, the ancillary MPC uses the measured data of each step for initialization. Therefore, the tube-based MPC has the same information volume as the closed-loop MPC. We conjectured that the overall tube structure can outperform the closed-loop MPC with the same amount of information. The results obtained by all the models were directly input into the BOPTEST framework to obtain the final operation control effect. 4.2 Uncertainty prediction generation BOPTEST can directly predict the future perfectly at the current time step. The prediction uncertainty in this study was also generated based on the perfect prediction results. We aimed to run the optimization at 15-minute intervals throughout the day. Therefore, the forecast horizon was also chosen to be one ensemble with 96 time steps. We currently only considered the uncertainty of outdoor temperature prediction. The remaining parameters were assumed to be 100% accurate by default. Fig. 8 presents the uncertainty space specified in this study. The MAPE was 10% when predicting the temperature for the first time step in the future. The MAPE was 10%. As the time steps increased, the prediction error increased, reaching approximately 20% at the end. By combining factors, such as computing load, we generated four different prediction results from the uncertain space, according to the average distribution, as shown in the figure below. Finally, to better verify the effectiveness of the tube-based MPC and compensate for the defect caused by considering only a single piece of uncertainty in the previous study, we generated several pieces of prediction data in the uncertainty space to test the results of robust optimization. We combined factors, such as computing load, to generate four different prediction results from the uncertain space, according to the average distribution, as shown in the figure below (Fig. 9). We used the four generated different prediction results to perform MPC calculations separately and create statistics and a summary of all the results. 4.3 Results and discussions We verified the performance of the proposed robust MPC strategy for HVAC systems in the presence of uncertainties, as discussed in this section. In addition, owing to the setting of tightening constraints in the tube-based MPC algorithm, we also compared the changes in the optimization results caused by tightening in different situations. The optimization effect depends on the degree of constraint tightening in the nominal MPC result [39]. The specific details of the different constraints are presented in Table 2. Given the vast number of constraint methods available, our objective is to establish a correlation between changes in constraints and model performance, and to estimate a feasible range for optimal constraints. Regarding the fan control range, we gradually reduced its length by 0.1 units for each constraint, from 0.8 for constraint 1 to 0.7 for constraint 3. Similarly, for temperature control, we systematically decreased the adjustable space by 4 degrees Celsius for each constraint, leading to adjustments such as 13 to 9 and 39 to 37. To expand the range of constraint tightening, the authors augmented constraint 4. They sought to evaluate the algorithm\u2019s performance under conditions of excessive constraint tightening, recognizing that exhaustive coverage of all possible scenarios is unfeasible. The problem of infeasibility arising from tightened constraints can be a challenging issue. However, in this case, we do not rely heavily on strict constraints, our experiments demonstrate that the feasibility of the model is not significantly impacted by the tightening of constraints. In situations where constraints are tightly restricted, the model may adopt a more fixed control strategy to maintain feasibility. The comparison results are listed in Table 3, and all the results are the average results of the four uncertain scenarios. 4.3.1 Comparison between M.1, M.2, and M.3 We first compared the gaps between the two baseline models (M.1 and M.2). From the perspective of operating costs, M.2 reduced the operating costs of the HVAC system by 10.71% more than M.1. However, M.2 did not outperform M.1 in terms of indoor temperature control. M.2 increased the average range of temperature control by 6.33% more than that of M.1. From the point of view of the percentage increase in the two indicators alone, M.2 seems to be slightly superior to M.1. However, it is difficult to arbitrarily explain the advantages and disadvantages of M.1 and M.2 under the four types of uncertainty predictions. The results of M.3 are superior to those of the traditional open-loop and closed-loop MPC in terms of the two optimization metrics. M.3 had the highest running cost in the tube-based MPC (Constraint 4). Nevertheless, its operating cost was 32.14% and 24% lower than that of the open- and closed-loop MPC, respectively. M.3 (Constraint 3) yielded the best result in terms of the running cost index. Compared with the open- and closed-loop MPC, the running cost was lower by 48.8% and 42.6%, respectively. The tube-based MPC improved the operating costs regardless of the kind of constraint used. In terms of indoor temperature control, the tube-based MPC achieved remarkable improvement. The temperature control of M.3 (Constraint 3) had the closest distance to the target trajectory, and the average total distance under the four uncertainty spaces was 200.31. This result was 30.35% and 34.49% better than those of the open-loop and closed-loop MPC, respectively. M.3 (Constraint 1), the overall average of the worst-performing tube-based MPC was 25.92% better than that of the open-loop MPC, which performed better in the baseline model. Similarly, we can assume that the tube-based MPC can better control the indoor temperature sequence under uncertainty than the traditional MPC. To better analyze the specific situation in the optimization process, we chose M.1, M.2, and M.3 (Constraint 3) in the first prediction case for a detailed visual analysis. First, Fig. 10 shows the comparison of the indoor temperature variation of three different optimization models. An observation reveals that the curve does not converge towards the target temperature. This discrepancy can be attributed to the algorithm\u2019s utilization of the RC model, which exhibits a calculation difference from the BOPTEST model. Although the calculated strategy closely approximated the target temperature in the RC model, its implementation in the BOPTEST framework introduced errors that led to deviations from expected results. Due to the accumulation of errors, the resulting curve failed to converge as intended. First, we observed that the indoor temperature controlled by the M.2 model changed more drastically. Consequently, in most time steps, the temperature range was very different from the target temperature. This may be because the M.2 model updated the measured value as the initial value at each step, and this part of the measured value may be significantly different from the calculation of the RC model, resulting in drastic indoor temperature changes. The trend change in the M.1 model was more stable, probably because the strategy was always generated in the RC model. The control trajectory of the M.3 model was similar to the calculation results of the open-loop MPC in most time steps. However, because of the existence of the tube structure, it will be closer to the target sequence. We compared the effect of the temperature setting and fan control signal of the three strategies at different time steps on the operating costs under the same conditions, as shown in Fig. 11. To corroborate the comparison results, we also show the time-of-use electricity price in the optimization goal in the figure. First, we compared the differences in actions between the different models. Based on the control action of the temperature setting, the control sequence of M.3 was closer to the open-loop MPC of M.1 because the nominal MPC in the tube-based MPC was also an open-loop optimization problem. In addition, combined with the time-of-use electricity price information, the closed-loop MPC made significant action adjustments according to the change in the time-of-use electricity price. Therefore, its operating cost was also better than that of M.1. The fan action part was not fully adjusted according to the time-of-use electricity price because the fan energy consumption was calculated separately in the model. 4.3.2 Comparison between different constraints in tube-based MPC A tube-based MPC needs to tighten the constraints on the nominal MPC. The state and control inputs of the nominal MPC are subsets of the real system. It is generally believed that tighter constraints are more robust to uncertainties. In Table 3, we chose four different constraint (Constraints 1 to 4). The constraints were progressively stricter. In terms of the overall statistical results, Constraint 3 achieved the best control effect. However, when the constraint was further tightened to Constraint 4, the operating cost and temperature control effect worsened. From a numerical point of view of the constraints, the minimum temperature control of Constraint 4 reached 20 °C. However, the target temperature during off-hours during optimization was only 15 °C. In addition, the range of the fan control was only 0.4\u20130.6, which was 20% of the original range. This indicated that excessive constraint tightening affected the final effect of the tube-based MPC. Further, it underscored the importance of choosing an appropriate tightening range. Fig. 12 plots the tube-based MPC with different constraints under the first prediction scenario. It can also be seen that the trajectory of Constraint 4 was significantly different from that of the other three. 5 Conclusions We proposed a tube-based robust MPC controller for office HVAC systems. The entire framework consists of two parts: nominal MPC and ancillary MPC, which can determine the optimal trajectory of the set temperature and fan control signal of the HVAC system set to minimize the operating costs while maintaining the indoor temperature target to the greatest extent in the presence of uncertainty. Through experiments, the effectiveness of the proposed strategy was verified in comparison with the traditional MPC strategies. The main findings of this study are summarized as follows. \u2022 The proposed algorithm uses the open-source BOPTEST testing framework. The thermal dynamic model of the building is simplified using the RC model. The result proved that the entire workflow has certain practical application value, when calculating the indoor air temperature, the MAPE is only 15.26% between RC model and BOPTEST emulator. \u2022 By modifying the assumptions of the forecast model, the entire algorithm became more in line with the actual forecast model, reflecting gradual decline in the forecast accuracy. \u2022 The proposed tube-based MPC guarantees better optimization results in different prediction scenarios. In terms of the running cost optimization goals, compared to the best traditional MPC, the tube-based MPC reduced the average running cost by at least 24% more. Considering the optimization of indoor temperature control, the tube-based MPC guarantees a reduction of approximately 26% in the distance to the target trajectory. \u2022 When the fan control constraint is reduced to 0.4 to 0.6, and the temperature control constraint is reduced to 20 to 32 degrees Celsius, the performance of the tube based MPC algorithm is weaker than the constraint 3 in this experiment. Therefore, an appropriate tightening method must be selected for the nominal MPC to maintain the performance of the tube-based MPC. In future research, we hope to construct accurate and adaptive RC models for different optimization scenarios and different buildings and verify the advantages of robust algorithms in uncertain spaces based on RC models. In addition, in this study, uniform distribution sampling, which is sometimes not a reasonable time series, was adopted for the prediction. In conclusion, given the potential issues that may arise from enforcing stricter constraints in nominal MPC, it would be beneficial to explore more sophisticated MPC algorithms, such as double layered MPC [55], to effectively manage the infeasible problems that may arise during the model\u2019s solution process. Future research can therefore focus on comparing and integrating advanced MPC techniques to address these challenges.

Model predictive control (MPC) is an effective control algorithm that can facilitate the active control of complex systems such as the HVAC system. However, the uncertainty of the prediction model engenders many challenges in practical application. To address these issues, we propose a tube-based MPC strategy. First, a reduced-order thermal capacitance and thermal resistance model is established for the target system. Subsequently, a tube-based MPC scheme is designed to effectively handle uncertainties in real systems. The prediction uncertainty space is re-assumed in the tube, combined with the actual prediction error, to more closely correspond to the actual situation. The proposed model is tested and validated using the BOPTEST open-source testing framework. The results show that the proposed tube-based MPC can reduce the operating cost by at least 24%, compared with the traditional open-loop and closed-loop MPC, and can better control the indoor temperature when considering multiple uncertain predictions.",
