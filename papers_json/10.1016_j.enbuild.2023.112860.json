This paper presents the results of model predictive control (MPC) using multiple deep neural network (DNN) models for the cooling system of a factory building. The target building accommodates a large space (80 m × 60 m × 9.7 m) and serves cooling via 45 diffusers connected to a direct expansion air handling unit that comprises two air supply fans and four condensing units. The authors developed 10 simulation models using a DNN: One predicts the supply air temperature of the HVAC system, while the others predict the indoor temperature of nine zones. The models can sufficiently predict the thermal behavior of the HVAC system (normalized mean bias error (NMBE): −1.2 %, coefficient of variation of the root mean square error (CVRMSE): 3.8 %) and indoor environment (NMBE: 1.1 %, CVRMSE: 1.3 %). The purpose of the MPC is to minimize the energy consumption of the condensing units while maintaining the cooling set-point temperature. The MPC was applied to the target building for a sampling time of 10 min, for four weeks, from August 23 to September 17, 2021. It was found that energy consumption decreased by 35.1 % compared with the baseline period, while satisfying the cooling set-point temperature maintenance condition. Finally, the authors highlight that the DNN-based MPC is a practical approach sufficient for predicting indoor thermal behavior and has significant potential for energy saving. Keywords Model Predictive Control HVAC System Factory Building Artificial Neural Network Building Energy Data availability No data was used for the research described in the article. 1 Introduction Heating, cooling, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems are responsible for 30 %\u201350 % of the total energy consumption of buildings, while the remaining energy is used for lighting, electrical appliances, etc. [15,21,32]. Accordingly, HVAC systems play a significant role in the energy efficiency of a building, because efficient control of an HVAC system leads to significant energy saving as well as improved thermal comfort and indoor environmental quality [8]). However, approximately 30 % of factory building operations do not have specific improvement schemes and targets for energy efficiency [16,17]. There is great energy-saving potential in factory buildings because facility managers perform a conservatively simple operation (on/off). The operation property causes difficulties in preemptively responding to uncertainties and unknown causality in the indoor environment. Consequently, the traditional operation often results in discomfort to occupants and loss of energy [1,2,25]. Accordingly, it is essential to predict an uncertain indoor environment as well as efficiently control the HVAC systems in factory buildings. The control strategy of HVAC systems in general buildings is still dominated by rule-based control with only limited energy-saving capabilities [3]. Recently, advanced control strategies such as model predictive control (MPC) have been widely adopted for data accessibility, hardware\u2019s decreasing costs, advances in information and communications technology (ICT), and energy management system (EMS) technologies, which allow easy data collection, storage, and analysis of data related to buildings [26]. Accordingly, MPC has become the dominant control strategy in smart building operations because its strength lies in predicting future dynamic behavior. By making predictions, it is possible to adopt the optimal HVAC system control method for constraint conditions, weather, and indoor environments in a systematic and flexible manner [9,26]. Mathematical models (white box), hybrid models (gray box), and data-driven models (black box) have been established for simulation methods to predict the dynamic behavior of an indoor environment and control the corresponding HVAC system [20]. Recently, a data-driven machine learning method has been widely used to simulate the dynamic behavior of the indoor environment and HVAC systems using only measurement data because the white box model requires in-depth expertise [13,19,30], as well as laborious parameter estimation for facility systems and indoor environments [5,7,10,31]. Data-driven models facilitate the simulation of dynamic behavior based on the relationship between the input and output variables [27]. Such models include the autoregressive moving average, artificial neural network (ANN), and support vector machine (SVM). The advantage of these approaches is that the thermal behavior of HVAC systems can be sufficiently simulated using only variables related to the HVAC system, and they can be used without in-depth knowledge, unlike the white-box and gray-box models. However, there is a disadvantage in that the prediction accuracy outside the range of the training data may be lower. MPC studies based on machine learning models have been conducted on existing office or residential buildings, experimental facilities, or virtual simulated environments. For example, some researchers have conducted machine learning-based MPC to predict detailed indoor thermal environments and control HVAC systems in residential buildings [2,11]. Afram et al. [2] applied a supervisory MPC strategy to the cooling systems of residential buildings using an ANN-based MPC. In this process, the MPC comprised five HVAC systems (energy recovery ventilator, buffer tank, air handling unit, radiant floor heating system, and ground source heat pump). The MPC was then used for minimizing a cost function based on the prediction results of the MPC. As a result, cooling costs were reduced by 6.61\u201373.79 % compared with the costs of the existing set-point operation. Ghofrani et al. [11] proposed hybrid data-driven approaches (multivariate linear regression and ANN models) to capture nonlinearities and predict the building zone-level average temperature response to cooling in a variable air volume (VAV) system. Consequently, the nonlinearity of the indoor temperature changed due to the predictive control of the VAV system. Even though the model was developed with a simple environment, it required more than 10 environmental information inputs. Thus, complex environments are difficult to model when there is a lack of relevant information. Other researchers have developed ANN-based CFD models to predict detailed indoor environmental parameters (i.e., air pollutant concentration, temperature, and humidity) and control HVAC systems in an experimental chamber environment [24,33]. These models were sufficient to predict the environment, exhibiting the difference of 15 % compared with the CFD simulation model. The authors achieved a 35 % energy-saving potential via optimization of the target parameters (ventilation rate, indoor air temperature (IAT), and indoor relative humidity (RH)). These studies indicate that ANN-based MPC can simulate detailed environmental conditions. However, there are some limitations in that it targets the environment of a small experimental chamber or simulation model, which is a relatively simple air-conditioning environment, and a large amount of information and procedures were required in the studies to simulate the causality of the HVAC system and indoor environment in general buildings. Thus, this process has some difficulties when applied to buildings with complex large spaces and limited environmental data. Moreover, few studies have been conducted on saving energy through controlling HVAC systems in factory buildings [6,17,18]. Biswas [6] proposed reinforcement learning for controlling four valves (heating, cooling, humidifier, and reheating) to reduce energy consumption and CO2 concentration, which resulted in 25 % energy savings. However, this study mainly indicated energy savings due to the application of reinforcement learning in HVAC systems and lacks a detailed analysis of the indoor environment. In addition, because the method was developed and applied based on the user's knowledge of HVAC systems in a factory building, there are limitations to using a large amount of prior knowledge and HVAC system information. Mawson and Hughes [18] proposed an optimization method of peak shaving for HVAC operation and manufacturing schedules using a random forest model with the accuracy of 96.5 %. The model inputs included the weather (temperature, humidity, cloud, and wind speed), manufacturing schedule, and occupant information, while the outputs were four variables (indoor air temperature, RH, HVAC energy consumption, and total building energy consumption) for the factory building. The authors analyzed the influence of factors affecting the manufacturing and HVAC system schedules and obtained 15.1 % energy savings only via peak load control, although the authors did not use MPC. Herein, we present a real-time MPC in an existing factory building. To perform the MPC, ten data-driven models were developed to predict the supply air temperature (SAT) and IAT of nine zones in real time by linking the models. The dynamic behavior of HVAC systems and the indoor environment were predicted using the ten DNN models with minimalistic sensors and the operation status of the HVAC system for 20 min at 10 min intervals. The MPC results tested for four weeks in the existing building were analyzed. The authors found that the ANN-based MPC method is a practical and elaborate control method that links the dynamic behavior of the HVAC system and the indoor environment using minimal information on actual factory buildings. More specifically, the minimalistic modeling approach makes a practical contribution to saving energy and maintaining the indoor environment. 2 Target building The target building is a heavy machinery engine processing plant located in Inchon, South Korea (Fig. 1 (a)). The building constitutes a single-story floor with the area of 80 m (w) × 60 m (d) × 9.7 m (h). The cooling system is a direct-expansion-type air handling unit (DX AHU) (Fig. 1(b)\u2013(d)). The DX AHU comprises four air-cooled condensing units (CDUs) (cooling capacity: 210 kW × 4EA, power consumption: 54.5 kW × 4EA, COP: 3.9) and two supply fans (airflow rate: 40,000 m3/h × 2EA, power consumption: 30 kW × 2EA)) (Table 1 ). In these systems, chilled refrigerant (R22) is supplied to the DX AHU coil, and the indoor environment is then cooled by the supply air from two supply fans (Fig. 1 (d)). The supply air is branched into a three-way rectangular duct (upper, middle, and lower parts, Fig. 1(e)\u2013(g)) in the room and delivered to the working space through a circular duct with the diameter of 30 cm, hence cool air is directly supplied to workers inside (Fig. 1(h)). Please note that there is no return duct in the room and the supply air is 100 % outdoor air because the room is an engine manufacturing space with significant odors and dirt. According to the results of measuring the on-site indoor environment on Jul.14, 2021 (maximum outdoor air temperature (OAT) of 34.2 °C, outdoor RH of 57.8 %) during the hot season, the cooling type that implements local cooling in the working space causes a local temperature difference, which is thermally uncomfortable for occupants (Fig. 2 (a)\u2013(c)). As indicated in Figs. 1-2, the interior spaces are irregular and influenced by the cooling supply type (circular supplying air duct) and time-varying cooling load. In this study, the authors developed a method for simulating indoor spaces and used it for the predictive cooling control of the target building. The target building had limited information regarding the operational status of the HVAC system as well as a small number of wired environmental sensors. Therefore, the authors installed a total of ten wireless environmental sensors to obtain relevant information about the indoor environment and HVAC system. Nine environmental sensors were installed in the working area to acquire indoor environmental information, and one environmental sensor was installed in the supply air duct. In the target building, the measured information included: OAT and RH (OA), IAT and RH (IA01\u2013IA09 (wireless), IA10\u2013IA14 (wired)), SAT and RH (SA), and operating status of the CDUs (Fig. 3 ). The authors developed simulation models for the MPC, as described in the following section. 3 Real-time MPC The cooling system of the target building was a DX AHU that used 100 % outside air. The outside air is chilled through a cooling coil connected to the condensing units and supplied to the indoor environment. Therefore, the dynamic behavior in the HVAC system is determined by the outdoor environment, the operation status of the condensing units, and the supply fan. However, only the operational status, power consumption of the condensing units, and the supply fan were measured in the building, and there was no information on the refrigerant and supply air. With this in mind, modeling of the DX AHU and indoor environment was implemented using an ANN that simulates the SAT of the DX AHU and the IAT using only the measured data. 3.1 Prediction model The ANN consists of a multi-layer perceptron structure including input, hidden, and output layers connected as neurons using synaptic weights [4]. ANNs are used to model the complex pattern between the input and output under uncertainty and large data [23]. In this study, the following ANN parameters were determined using a trial-and-error method (hidden layers: 3, hidden nodes: 30, activation function: rectified linear unit (ReLU), epochs: 500, optimization method: adaptive moment estimation (Adam), and loss function: mean squared error (MSE)). Two types of ANN models were developed using a Keras module, Python deep learning API: One is to predict the SAT, and the others predict the IATs at nine locations (Table 2 ). The input variables of the SAT prediction model include the current OAT, outdoor air RH (OARH), CDU operating status (CDU ON/OFF), and fan operating status (fan ON/OFF) at time t. The output variable was the SAT after 10 min (time t + 10). The input variables of the indoor temperature prediction model include the OAT, IAT01\u201309, CDU operation status, fan operation status at the past 10 min (time t-10) and present (time t), and SAT at the present (time t) and after 10 min (time t + 10). The output variables were IAT01\u201309 over 10 min. The predicted SAT and IAT were used as input variables for the prediction of the next timestep or in 20 min (Fig. 4 ). 3.2 Model training and test The training and test sets for the ten ANN models utilized 80 % and 20 % of the total data, respectively (Jul. 15, 2021\u2013Aug. 20, 2021). The indices used to evaluate the prediction performance of the models are the normalized mean bias error (NMBE) and the coefficient of variance root mean square error (CVRMSE) (Eqs. (1)\u2013(2)). As shown in Table 3 , the SAT and IAT models proved to be good enough for predicting the dynamic behavior of the HVAC system and indoor environment because the NMBE and CVRMSE values of the SAT and IAT models are far less than those recommended by ASHRAE [12] (for hourly simulation, the NMBE and CVRMSE should be less than 10 %, 30 %, respectively). In addition, Fig. 5 shows the scatter plots between measured vs predicted IATs and SAT for the entire test sets. (1) N M B E = 1 n ∑ i n ( m i - s i ) m ¯ × 100 % , (2) C V R M S E = 1 m ¯ ∑ i = 1 n ( m i - s i ) 2 n × 100 % , where m i represents the measured data, s i represents the simulated data, and n represents the number of data points. 3.3 Mpc MPC has received considerable attention and has been widely used in HVAC control [26]. MPC is an optimal control strategy that can minimize an objective function over a finite prediction horizon [9]. In this process, the simulation model must have sufficient accuracy to predict the future response of a system and capture the dynamics of the temperature of each zone in response to control variables and disturbances [14]. The MPC uses current and future states, and control variables to optimize the future behavior of the HVAC system and indoor environment under constraints. Fig. 6 is a schematic diagram of the MPC platform that was constructed to control the actual HVAC system of the target building. Data measured from the IoT environment sensors and the HVAC system are transmitted to the Open Time-series Database and the Real-time Monitoring & Control (RMC) system via the edge gateway and Data acquisition system (DAS) using the wireless network. The measured data are then used as input values for the MPC in the Python environment. The optimal control variables obtained from the MPC are sent to PLC and DDC via RMC to activate the required number of CDUs in real time. Fig. 7 depicts a schematic of the MPC structure of the target building. The objective function and constraints were set to minimize the energy use of the four CDUs and maintain the cooling set-point temperature (27 °C) for 20 min. In this process, the SAT model receives the input data (OAT, OA RH, operation status of the CDU, and supply fan operating status in real time) via Wi-Fi and predicts the SAT after 10 min (Eq. (3)). The IAT models then receive the input data, which include the OAT, IAT, operation status of the CDU, supply fan (time t-10, t), and SAT (time t, t + 10). The predicted SAT and IAT are used as input variables for the next timestep prediction in 20 min (Eq (4)). While the average predicted IAT (at nine points) remains lower than or equal to 27 °C after 20 min (Eq. (5)), MPC searches for an energy-saving strategy by minimizing the number of operating CDUs using the global search method (Eq. (6)). More specifically, if the average predicted temperatures after 10 and 20 min are less than 27 °C, the operating status of the four CDUs is determined using the global search method, which can minimize the overall energy consumption. The total number of search spaces is 25 (the number of search spaces = 5 (0[all CDUs off], 1, 2, 3, 4 [four CDUs on] at the current timestep t) × the number of search spaces = 5 (0, 1, 2, 3, 4 at timestep t + 10)). Please note that to provide outdoor air, two air supply fans must always be on, even though all the CDUs are off.

The HVAC operation was performed based on the facility team\u2019s prior experience, turning on all four CDUs throughout the cooling season (Fig. 8 ). Nevertheless, owing to the characteristics of the DX AHU using 100 % OA, it was found that the cooling load could not be removed during the peak season (Aug.17\u201328, 2020), and the IAT was maintained at 30 °C or higher (Table 4 ). However, the IAT was lower than the cooling set-point temperature of 27 °C during the intermediate period (Sept.7\u201330, 2020). 4.2 Energy saving between existing control and MPC The MPC was applied over the period of Aug. 23-Sep. 17, 2021 (26 days, 24 h each day). For a fair comparison of the energy usage between the existing control and MPC, the authors adopted existing operation days similar to the outdoor temperature of the MPC period. The existing operation days were selected from Jun. 1 to Sept. 30, 2020 (122 days). The author compared the OAT patterns of a similar one day during the existing operation period to the OAT patterns of a specific one day during the MPC period. For the similarity evaluation, the day with the lowest CVRMSE (%) between the OATs measured on two days from 00:00 to 24:00 was considered (Table 5 , Appendix A). As a result of MPC, the energy-saving rate of the DX AHU was 35.1 % (81,751 kWh vs 53,048 kWh) for four weeks (Aug.23\u2013Sept.19, 2021). The energy-saving rates for the four weeks were 21.5 %, 44.5 %, 44.5 %, and 26.7 %, respectively (Table 6 ). The energy-saving rates in the 2nd and 3rd weeks were higher than those in the 1st and 4th weeks. This is because the OAT had a significant effect on the energy-saving rate (Table 7 ). During the 2nd week, the average OAT from Aug.31 \u2013 Sept.1 (20.8\u201321.0 °C) was generally low, resulting in a large energy-saving rate (Aug.31: 3,141 kWh → 1,045 kWh (66.7 %), Sept.1: 1,475 kWh → 669 kWh (54.6 %)). In the 3rd week, the average OAT on Sept.6\u20137 (22.0\u201319.9 °C) was low with a high energy-saving rate (Sept.6: 4,012 kWh → 1,238 kWh (69.1 %), Sept.7: 3,324 kWh → 680 kWh (79.5 %)). However, the minimum OAT in the 1st week was generally high, and the maximum OAT during the 4th week was the highest. Accordingly, as the cooling load increased, the energy-saving rate was lower than those in the 2nd and 3rd weeks (Fig. 9 ). As the potential for energy saving is greater when the OAT is low, the MPC enables significant energy savings by considering real-time changes in the OAT and IAT. In contrast, the existing control had to rely on the decision of the facility team. Note that for Aug.25\u201326 (Wednesday\u2013Thursday), the MPC used more energy than the existing control. During the MPC period, it was operated for 24 h to meet the cooling set-point temperature, whereas the existing control cooling was not performed during lunchtime 12:00\u201312:50 and dinner time 18:00\u201319:30 as per the facility manager's judgment. Therefore, more energy was used during the MPC period (Aug.25: 3,300 kWh vs 3,797 kWh, Aug.26: 3,300 kWh vs 3,702 kWh). 4.3 Thermal environment Table 8 shows the root mean square error (RMSE) results for the cooling set-point temperature (27 °C) during the existing control and MPC. The weekly RMSE of the IAT for the cooling set-point temperature differs in the range of 1.9 times (216.7 °C/116.7 °C) (Aug.30 \u2013 Sept.5) to 2.9 times (155.2 °C/52.9 °C) (Sept.13\u201319), and the daily RMSE differs by the maximum of 8.4 times (94.5 °C /11.3 °C) (Sept.9). During the four weeks (two supply fans continuously operated during the four weeks), the number of operating CDUs has been determined by the MPC, while the existing control operated four CDUs regardless of the indoor temperature (Figs. 10-13 ). Nevertheless, there were some cases where the cooling set-point temperature was not maintained due to the fact that the cooling capacity of four CDUs varies depending on the temperature and humidity of the outdoor air. When the IAT exceeds the cooling set-point temperature despite the maximum operation of the CDUs, it was caused by a high OAT, internal load, and HVAC system property using 100 % OA. In addition, the indoor air temperature reached 30.1 °C on Sept. 4 because all CDUs were mistakenly switched off from 9:50 to 13:37 (Fig. 11(a), (c)). Meanwhile, when the IAT is maintained lower than the cooling set-point temperature, only two air supply fans are continuously operated without CDU operation to provide outdoor air. For the MPC and baseline periods, the minimum and maximum IATs were shown in Figs. 10\u201313: 26.0\u201329.9 °C and 22.6\u201330.1 °C in the first week, 23.6\u201328.3 °C and 22.3\u201330.8 °C in the second week, 23.8\u201328.3 °C and 22.6\u201332.0 °C in the third week, and 24.9\u201328.5 °C and 22.6\u201332.0 °C in the fourth week. In the existing weekday operating hours in Week 4, the CDU was operated at maximum, and the energy loss increased as the IAT dropped to 22.6 °C. Whereas, as the entire cooling system is stopped during lunch (12:00\u201313:00) and dinner times (18:00\u201319:00), the IAT rises rapidly to 32 °C (Fig. 13(b), (c)). 5 Conclusion In this study, the authors developed two ANN models for the real-time MPC implementation of a factory building. The ANN models comprised an SAT prediction model and IAT models with nine temperature measurement points. The models used minimalistic inputs, including IAT, OAT, SAT, and the operation status of the DX AHU. The SAT model predicts the future SAT for 10 min using a wireless sensor installed in a supply air duct, while IAT models predict the future IAT of nine measurement points at 10 min intervals for 20 min. The MPC strategy was developed to minimize HVAC system energy use while maintaining a cooling set-point temperature (27 °C). The following results were obtained: \u2022 The authors developed a simulation model based on a minimalistic approach and implemented the MPC in a factory building. To realize the MPC for the factory building where the building has limited information on the HVAC system and a spacious indoor environment, the ANN-based MPC was performed. In this process, an SAT model and indoor environment models were developed and integrated to perform the MPC. The prediction accuracy of the SAT model and the nine IAT models proved to be good enough. The accuracy of the SAT model is demonstrated through the corresponding CVRMSE of 3.8 % and NMBE of −1.2 %, while that of the nine IAT models was within 1.1 % and the CVRMSE was 1.3 %. \u2022 The MPC achieved an energy saving of 35.1 % for four weeks compared with the existing control. The weekly energy-saving rates were 21.5 % (Aug.23\u2013Aug.29), 44.5 % (Aug.30\u2013Sept.5), 44.5 % (Sept.6\u201312), and 26.7 % (Sept.13\u201319). In particular, the energy-saving rates in the 1st and 4th weeks under a light cooling load were 1.6\u20132.1 times higher than those in the 2nd and 3rd weeks under a high cooling load. It was found that the energy-saving potential becomes greater under the light cooling period than the high cooling load period. \u2022 The MPC could contribute to avoiding overcooling. More specifically, the MPC maintained the average IAT of the nine points similar to the cooling set-point temperature (27 °C). Compared to the existing control, the MPC reduced the deviation (RMSE) between the IAT and the cooling set-point temperature by up to three times. Accordingly, the MPC can prevent overcooling to save energy. Existing methods for predicting the thermal behavior of HVAC systems and indoor environments require a large amount of information and computational load to simulate a large and complex environment in a factory building. These approaches do generally not consider real-time changes in indoor and outdoor states. The MPC proposed in this study can predict the thermal behavior of HVAC systems and multiple IAT points using a small number of environmental sensors. The MPC can maintain a cooling set-point temperature for the four weeks with good accuracy and achieve a high energy-saving rate. Conclusively, the authors suggested a practical and minimalistic approach of MPC for the HVAC system in the existing factory building. As exemplified in this study, ANN-based lumped models can be a good candidate to explain the dynamic relationship (the number of operating CDUs, supply air temperature of HVAC system, indoor air temperature at multiple points) and to perform optimal control of cooling systems in existing buildings. In other words, this study signifies that the simulation model does not have to be always a highly-sophisticated/over-complicated/high-fidelity model for implementing MPC. Future studies will include how to use transfer learning for similar MPC problems.

        "dc:description": "This paper presents the results of model predictive control (MPC) using multiple deep neural network (DNN) models for the cooling system of a factory building. The target building accommodates a large space (80 m × 60 m × 9.7 m) and serves cooling via 45 diffusers connected to a direct expansion air handling unit that comprises two air supply fans and four condensing units. The authors developed 10 simulation models using a DNN: One predicts the supply air temperature of the HVAC system, while the others predict the indoor temperature of nine zones. The models can sufficiently predict the thermal behavior of the HVAC system (normalized mean bias error (NMBE): −1.2 %, coefficient of variation of the root mean square error (CVRMSE): 3.8 %) and indoor environment (NMBE: 1.1 %, CVRMSE: 1.3 %). The purpose of the MPC is to minimize the energy consumption of the condensing units while maintaining the cooling set-point temperature. The MPC was applied to the target building for a sampling time of 10 min, for four weeks, from August 23 to September 17, 2021. It was found that energy consumption decreased by 35.1 % compared with the baseline period, while satisfying the cooling set-point temperature maintenance condition. Finally, the authors highlight that the DNN-based MPC is a practical approach sufficient for predicting indoor thermal behavior and has significant potential for energy saving.",
