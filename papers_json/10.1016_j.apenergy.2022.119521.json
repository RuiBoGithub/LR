At present, transactive control (TC) represents a novel demand response control method. As traditional TC strategies are incapable of determining the market-clearing price, the room set-point temperature cannot be calculated. Therefore, this study proposes a simplified improved transactive control (ITC) method for the demand response (DR) needs of air-conditioning systems. The relationship between the real-time electricity price and the user's bidding electricity price determines the set-point temperature of the ITC method. In addition to this, this method's control process is both simple and easy to implement. In order to test this method, the study conducted field experiments on a full-scale variable air volume air-conditioning platform. Four typical summer days were selected for the space cooling experiment. Of the four, three adopted the ITC strategy, while one adopted the conventional control strategy. Another typical four days were selected for the space heating experiment in winter, and all adopted the ITC strategy. Several conclusions are drawn after comparing the ITC strategy to the conventional control strategy. For one, after adopting the ITC strategy, the maximum energy consumption reduction and saving operating costs in the DR period reached 59.29% and 66.12%, respectively. Furthermore, the total energy consumption reduction was 7.49\u201313.72%, while the saving total operating costs were 6.19\u201330.80%. After adopting the ITC strategy, the room temperature of the air-conditioning room was closer to the acceptable indoor thermal comfort range than in the case of the conventional control strategy. Together, these results suggested that the ITC strategy is an efficient demand response method for air-conditioning systems.

In turn, this has led to a continuous rise in power demand for air-conditioning systems. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the electricity consumption generated by air-conditioning systems has become one of the primary sources of electricity demand growth on the global scale [1]. The peak power consumption of air-conditioning is a short period of space cooling in the summer and another short period of space heating in the winter. This is one of the main reasons for the change in the peak-to-valley difference and the presence of a peak demand on the power load. Therefore, the peak power consumption of air-conditioning has gradually become the primary threat to the power grid's security and has caused a divergence between power supply and power demand. Relying on expanding power generation facilities to meet the short-term peak power demands of air-conditioning requires enormous investment and wastes social resources. Fortunately, Demand response (DR) represents a regulation method used for resolving the imbalance between the supply and demand of the power grid [2,3]. At present, this method is one of the most effective ways of demand-side management (DSM) [4]. In addition, as a thermostatically controlled load, the air-conditioning load is capable of converting electrical energy into thermal energy stored inside the building [5]. Thus, by adopting an effective DR strategy for air-conditioning systems, peak loads are reduced with little impact on the user's thermal comfort [6,7]. In addition, the supply\u2013demand imbalance may also be alleviated [8]. Transactive control (TC) represents a distributed control method based on the market and is thus sometimes referred to as market-based control (MBC) [9]. Through market mechanisms, TC enables end-user loads to participate in demand response. Thus, it represents a new type of demand response strategy [10], which achieves peak regulation and load shifting, while also managing to improve the flexibility of power system. Applying TC to the demand response of air-conditioning load may solve problems that traditional DR methods are not capable of resolving. Among others, these problems may be protecting end-users' privacy, respecting user preferences, and ensuring users' thermal comfort while implementing DR [11]. Initially, TC was applied in computer resource allocation [12]. Later on, it was used to analyze the demand-response of power systems [13] and coordinated control of distributed energy resources (DERs) [14]. Presently, a number of studies have investigated the demand response strategy of air-conditioning systems based on TC. In order to evenly distribute the air supply volume in air-conditioning rooms of commercial buildings, Huberman et al. [15] designed a market-based controller for a variable air volume (VAV) system. However, this study focused solely on airflow distribution. It did not consider the relationship between the VAV box, air handling unit (AHU), chiller, and other heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) system components during the demand response process. Corbin et al. [16] proposed a novel TC strategy for the commercial building HVAC system. Their results suggested a prosperous effect and application of TC. Huang et al. [17] proposed another TC method for using DR on rooftop air-conditioning units. The study argued that this strategy could achieve the expected goal of DR, while respecting the thermal comfort preferences of different building users. Many other researchers have used the simulation method to study the TC. For one, Mohammad et al.[18] established a transactive control model of industrial HVAC load for demand response purposes. The simulation results indicated that the dynamic temperature set-point reduced power consumption significantly. Furthermore, the HVAC controller was shown to save 15.23% ∼ 17.33% in power consumption during the peak period. Chandra et al. [19] proposed a transactive market-based control algorithm, that included agent bidding strategies and a market-clearing approach. The proposed transactive control was shown to be effective in normal operating conditions and provided DR services according to market price signals. In order to address real-time power shortages in a residential microgrid, Nematkhah et al. put forth a transactive energy (TE) framework for prosumers with HVAC systems [20]. Note that TC is an implementation of TE. The results suggested that the proposed framework reduced the energy cost of HVAC systems. In addition, a significant amount of research has been conducted on the use of TC strategies to regulate thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs). Behhoodi et al. [21] implemented TCLs in the real-time electricity retail market under the transactive control mode. They used agent-based modeling methods to aggregate loads, meaning that they adjusted the aggregate TCLs according to the real-time condition of the power grid in heating and cooling modes. Compared to conventional control strategies, this method appeared to reduce the cost of electricity consumption by more than 10%. Furthermore, when compared with the direct load control method, the experimental method was shown to protect users' privacy, while also reducing the complexity of control. Li et al. [22,23] proposed a market mechanism for regulating TCLs and designed a new bidding and clearing strategy. The simulation results showed that this mechanism could maximize social welfare and reduce the power blockage at DR time. Similarly, Ly et al. [24] suggested a fast transactive control approach. They developed a transactive demand response system that incorporated a large amount of thermostatically controlled air conditioning loads. Through various simulations, this approach was shown to reduce peak demand. Moreover, a number of researchers have studied the application of transactive control in buildings. In order to coordinate the thermal energy storage (TES) assets of multiple buildings, Yu et al. [25] developed an uncertainty-aware transactive control (UA-Tx) framework. They discovered that the energy cost savings were up to 3.7% for buildings under the UA-Tx aggregator control framework. Furthermore, Ge et al. [26] explored transactive control mechanisms that enable buildings to participate in power grid demand response. Experimental studies conducted on campus buildings suggested that the peak demand could be significantly reduced while maintaining the most considerable building energy revenue. The most famous application of transactive control in demonstration projects is the Olympic Peninsula GridWise pilot project designed by the Pacific Northwest National Lab (PNNL) in 2006\u20132007 [27,28]. The transactive control objects included household temperature controllers, household water heaters, household dryers, and commercial HVAC systems. The results demonstrated both the possibility and values of TC. Between 2011 and 2013, the PNNL completed the AEP Ohio gridSMART demonstration project [29], which designed the RTPda system. This system used a transactive control strategy to coordinate and control the air-conditioning system. The simulation results showed that when the popularization rate of the RTPda system reaches 35%, it can reduce the load by about 5% during the 3.5-hour electricity consumption peak. During the 2-hour peak, the load can be reduced by 8%. In addition, the Pacific Northwest Smart Grid project [30], jointly funded by the U. S. Department of Energy from 2009 to 2015, is also one of the earliest global pilot projects to implement transactive control. The object of transactive control involved 60,000 customers in five states and examined the entire power system, from power generation to consumption. The project applied transactive control to manage distributed generation and demand response. In Europe, the Powermatching City project [31] successively started the first and second phases of pilot projects in 2009 and 2011. As previously discussed, the applications of the TC strategy in the demand response of air-conditioning systems have been partially studied. In order to calculate the set-point temperature, most traditional TC strategies rely on the clearing price, i.e., the electricity price when the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied is known as the market-clearing price. However, within traditional TC strategies, the market-clearing price is difficult to determine, leading to the inability to calculate a room's set-point temperature. Furthermore, the control procedure of traditional TC strategies is quite complicated, making it challenging to implement. The majority of existing studies have focused on the simulation of the TC strategy. Few of them have been verified by field experiments and even less have considered the working conditions of air-conditioning systems in both space heating and space cooling. To address these research gaps, this work proposes a simplified improved transactive control (ITC) method that determines the set-point temperature by comparing the bidding price of air-conditioning users with the real-time electricity price. The study is based on the full-scale centralized energy storage air-conditioning experimental platform. To investigate the demand response effect of the ITC strategy to the building air-conditioning systems, field experiments are conducted for space cooling in the summer and space heating in the winter. Furthermore, the relationship between the bidding price, real-time electricity price, and set-point temperature are explored. In addition, the influence of the market cycle and the comfort factor on the operating effect are also investigated. Compared to previous studies, the critical practical contributions of this paper are: \u2022 Within this paper, the ITC method does not involve market-clearing prices. Rather, the set-point temperature is determined by comparing the real-time electricity price and the bidding electricity price. Thus, it has the advantage of both a simple control process and easy implementation. \u2022 Secondly, the present method is based on the dynamic electricity price, which transforms building electricity consumption from a \u201crigid load\u201d to a \u201cflexible load\u201d. Thus, electricity may be consumed in the DR mode. In cases where the power supply cannot meet the power demand, the power consumption is reduced by adjusting the set-point temperature of the air-conditioning system. On the other hand, when the power supply exceeds the demand, the room is precooled or preheated to increase electricity consumption. \u2022 Lastly, the traditional method examined in previous work tends to ignore individual thermal comfort preferences of air-conditioning users for the sake of the demand response effect. The ITC strategy designs the user thermal comfort setting module so that users may participate in the demand response according to their personal will. Thus, this strategy respects the personalized thermal comfort preferences of air-conditioner users. The rest of the paper is organized into several units. In Section 2, the principle of transactive control and traditional transactive control strategy was introduced. Next, this section introduces the ITC strategy from three aspects: system structure, bidding price, and determining the set-point temperature. The algorithm flow chart of the ITC strategy was designed for both space heating in the winter and space cooling in the summer operating conditions. Lastly, the field experiment platform was introduced. In Section 3, the experimental scheme of space cooling and space heating was designed, while the field experiment was conducted based on a full-scale physical experiment platform. Based on the experimental results from both cooling and heating conditions, the feasibility and demand response effects of the ITC strategy were analyzed. The paper concludes Section 4 where it summarized the main points and offered suggestions for future studies. 2 Methodology 2.1 Principles of transactive control Transactive control (TC) draws on microeconomics principles [32] to implement DR through market mechanisms and economic incentive signals as its communication basis [33]. TC is capable of establishing the dynamic balance between supply and demand for the entire power system. It is also able to reduce building electricity consumption and peak electricity consumption [34]. The crucial idea behind TC is combining market and control, i.e., combining higher-level dynamic market transactions with lower-level unit-level regional control [35]. As TC requires information only on exchange electricity prices and the required power consumption between power system and users, it does not infringe on the users' privacy [36]. As shown in Fig. 1 , the TC-based demand response of air-conditioning systems connects the bottom end demand of the air-conditioning with the electricity price of the top power grid by market mechanisms and price methods. Afterward, the system utilizes demand bidding and market-clearing to achieve a balance between supply and demand. Concretely, the air-conditioning room and the cold and heat sources clear and bid for the amount of cold air or hot air required by the air-conditioning system. On the other hand, the power grid and the cold and heat sources clear and bid for the amount of electricity required by the air-conditioning system. Within the traditional air-conditioning process, room temperature and set-point temperature are the sole information to control room heating and cooling. However, the TC algorithm uses price information (i.e., bidding and clearing prices) [37] to make decisions regarding air conditioning control. As a result, the air-conditioning load changes along with the electricity price. Furthermore, in the TC mode, air-conditioning users are able to participate in the power market bidding. The users bid according to their preference, adjust their power consumption according to the fluctuation trend of real-time electricity prices, and ultimately make the power consumption of the air-conditioning in accordance with the laws of the electricity market. In general, transactive control clears the transactive market according to the principle of maximizing social welfare. 2.2 Traditional transactive control strategy As shown in Fig. 2 , implementing the traditional transactive control (TC) strategy involves three steps: bidding, clearing, and adjustment in each market-clearing cycle. Firstly, bidding refers to obtaining information about the air-conditioning user (such as the current room temperature ( T cur t ), the user's desired room temperature ( T des t ) through the programmable thermostat of a home energy management system (HEMS) or building automation system (BAS). Later on, this phase converts this information into a bidding price ( P bid t ) or a demand curve (as illustrated in Fig. 2(a)). The second step is clearing. Here, the transactive controller aggregates the bidding price ( P bid t ) of all users or aggregates all demand curves to construct an aggregate demand curve (as shown in Fig. 2(b)) or aggregate demand function and then submits it to the electricity market. As shown in Fig. 2(c), the power grid simultaneously submits the power supply curve to the electricity market. Based on the principle of maximizing social welfare, the electricity market conducts market-clearing and obtains the clearing price ( P clear t ) and clearing electricity quantity ( q clear t ), as illustrated in Fig. 2(d). The last step of the process involves adjusting the set-point temperature in a room. In this case, the programmable thermostat calculates the set-point temperature by the clearing price (as illustrated in Fig. 2(e)) and adjusts the set-point temperature. The TC system repeats these steps once in each market-clearing cycle ( Δ t ) until the end of operating time. The market-clearing cycle may last 5 min, 15 min, or 1 h. In sum, the traditional TC process includes three steps: bidding, clearing, and adjustment. Accordingly, the TC control process is complex, making the market clearing price difficult to determine and the set-point temperature challenging to calculate. 2.3 Improved transactive control strategy In order to overcome the limitations of the traditional TC strategy and enhance its demand response potential in air-conditioning system DR, this paper proposes a simplified transactive control strategy suitable for real-time electricity prices. This strategy is termed the improved transactive control (ITC) strategy. 2.3.1 System structure Fig. 3 illustrates the system structure of ITC. The system determines the set-point temperature ( T set t ) by comparing the real-time electricity price ( P e t ) of the supply side (power grid) and the bidding price ( P bid t ) of the demand side (air-conditioning users). It establishes control over the power consumption of the air-conditioning system by writing the ITC algorithm in the air-conditioning automatic control system. The first step of ITC strategy is for the power grid to provide P e t at time t to the air-conditioning automatic control system. Meanwhile, the ITC strategy obtains information such as the current room temperature ( T cur t ), the user's desired room temperature ( T des t ), the comfort factor ( k t ), and the room minimum and maximum set-point temperature ( T min t and T max t ) at time t from the i th air-conditioning room. Even though only a single air-conditioning room is shown in Fig. 3, the ITC strategy is capable of controlling multiple air-conditioning rooms simultaneously. Based on both the above data and the ITC control algorithm, the automatic control system calculates the bidding price ( P bid t ) of the i th air-conditioning users. Through the ITC algorithm based on P bid t and P e t , the second step within the process will be to obtain T set t for the i th air-conditioning room at time t (detailed steps will be introduced in Section 2.3.3) and to adjust the current room set-point temperature to T set t . Once T set t for time t is determined, the system will update the status, i.e., obtaining the value of the current room temperature ( T cur t + 1 ), the user's desired room temperature ( T des t + 1 ) and the real-time electricity price ( P e t + 1 ) at time t+1. Once this is completed, the ITC control process will be repeated in the next Δ t until the air-conditioning system is turned off. When compared to the three steps of the traditional TC strategy, the ITC strategy appears to lack the second step, i.e., clearing, consisting of only two steps, namely bidding and adjustment. Thus, the control process of the ITC strategy is simpler than the control process of the traditional TC strategy. 2.3.2 Bidding price Unlike conventional control strategy, ITC uses market information (bidding prices and real-time electricity prices) to accomplish performance control. The essence of this strategy is to convert users' demands for space heating or cooling, as well as their preferences for thermal comfort and operating cost savings into a willingness to bid for the electricity price (termed the bidding price, P bid t ) during the next electricity market cycle ( Δ t ). Thus, determining the bidding price is the most crucial part of the ITC strategy. The price in question is based on the difference between the current room temperature and the user's desired room temperature, the user-selected parameters (comfort factor, and the minimum and maximum set-point temperature) and the mean and standard deviations of electricity prices. The mean and standard deviations stem from the electricity market. When the trading market in the transactive control strategy is real, P bid t could be bid as an actual bidding price to the electricity market. Conversely, when the trading market is designed virtually, the P bid t is also only a virtual bidding price. Under the space cooling conditions in the summer, the user's bidding price ( P bid t ) at time t is defined by the following equation: (1) P bid t = P mean + ( T cur t - T des t ) k t σ T max t - T min t Under the space heating conditions in the winter, the user's bidding price ( P bid t ) at time t is defined by the following equation: (2) P bid t = P mean + ( T des t - T cur t ) k t σ T max t - T min t In the above equations, P mean and σ represent the mean value of the electricity price and its standard deviation during a past 24-hour period ($/kWh), respectively. P mean and σ suggests that the past electricity prices can affect P bid t . Next, T cur t denotes the current room temperature (°C), while T des t represents the user's desired room temperature (°C). The symbols T min t and T max t represent the room minimum and maximum set-point temperature (°C), respectively. Next, k t denotes the comfort factor at time t. In general, its value range is [1,3], which provides a balance between comfort and economy. P bid t positively correlates with k t . Thus, users who prefer to achieve better thermal comfort rather than save air-conditioning operating costs should choose a larger k t value. For instance, when T cur t deviates from T des t in the cooling mode, a greater k t value will lead to an increase in the bidding price, resulting in the bid winning. Thus, just as conventional control, the ITC strategy ensures that a room's temperature control requirements are always met. 2.3.3 Determining set-point temperature In ITC, the notion of room set-point temperature is different than in conventional control. Namely, in the ITC strategy, the heating or cooling set-point temperature of the thermostat will be affected by the price signal of the electricity market and the comfort level set by the user. Consequently, the set-point temperature will not be a fixed value but will constantly change within [ T min t , T max t ]. Furthermore, the ITC strategy determines the set-point temperature ( T set t ) by comparing the quantity of P e t and P bid t at time t. Fig. 4 illustrates the ITC algorithm flow designated to determine the set-point temperature. More specifically, Fig. 4(a) represents the flow chart of space heating conditions in the winter, while Fig. 4(b) represents the flow chart of space cooling conditions in the summer. The red highlighted content illustrates the differences of the ITC strategy algorithms between the heating and cooling working conditions. The variable ε represents the amount of adjustment of the room set-point temperature ( T set t ) at time t. It is based on the set-point temperature ( T set t - 1 ) at the previous time t-1. Next, ε 1 t and ε 2 t represent the two specific values of ε , and 0 < ε 1 t < ε 2 t . The two values of ε 1 t and ε 2 t are designed to meet different situations where T cur t deviates from T des t . Namely, when T cur t significantly deviates from T des t , T set t should be adjusted with a great ε value, so that T cur t can be adjusted to T des t quickly. On the other hand, when the deviation of T cur t from T des t is small, T cur t may be controlled within the thermal comfort range by adjusting T set t with a smaller ε value. The StartTime represents the time at which the ITC program starts, while the StopTime represents the moment when it stops. The symbols Δ P max t and Δ P min t denote the maximum and minimum electricity price differences specified by users at time t. Lastly, Δ P c t represents the precooling or preheating electricity price difference (precooling in summer conditions and preheating in winter conditions). As shown in Fig. 4, P e t - P bid t ⩾ Δ P max t represents the period of high electricity prices as well as the DR time of users, which was automatically identified by the ITC strategy (called DR time of air-conditioning users). Next, P bid t - P e t ⩾ Δ P c t is termed the precooling or preheating time and represents the period of low electricity prices. Thus, even within the same air-conditioning system, the DR period of air-conditioning users and low electricity price period differ between users. In addition, the DR time of power grid is different from the DR time of air-conditioning users, which is jointly determined by power grid and electricity market. When not specified differently, both DR time and the high electricity price time denote the DR time of the power grid. During the low electricity price period, the user may freely choose whether to precool or preheat the room. If the user chooses to precool the room during the cooling conditions, T set t = T min t at the time of precooling, otherwise T set t = T des t . On the other hand, if the user decides to preheat the room during the heating conditions, T set t = T max t at the time of preheating, otherwise T set t = T des t . Based on real-time electricity price fluctuation, users may sometimes take advantage of lower electricity prices to save electricity bills by precooling or preheating their air-conditioning rooms. However, they may also increase electricity consumption by setting T set t to T min t or T max t , leading to an eventual increase in electricity bills. The proposed ITC strategy allows users to freely set the value of the variables: T min t , T max t , k t , ε 1 t , ε 2 t , T des t , Δ P min t , Δ P max t , Δ P c t at any t time based on their preferences and thermal comfort requirements. This process is termed the thermal comfort preference setting. Moreover, the users' preferences and comfort settings are reflected in the market bidding price, meaning that the ITC method greatly respects the user's preferences and personal wishes. When the power grid achieves its peak, the electricity price is increased in order to reduce users' electricity consumption. Thus, the period of high electricity prices is the time when the DR is urgently needed. The ITC strategy implements DR by increasing T set t during high electricity price periods in the summer cooling conditions. Similarly, it implements DR by reducing T set t in high electricity price periods of space heating in the winter. Conversely, to fully utilize the low electricity price periods, T set t is reduced to precool the room in the low electricity price period during the summer, while it is increased to preheat the room in the low electricity price period of the winter. In order to make full use of the real-time fluctuation characteristics of real-time electricity price, the proposed control strategy automatically schedules the room set-point temperature. Besides, based on the economy and occupants' thermal comfort, air-conditioning users were divided into two types. The first exhibited high thermal comfort requirements, while the other had low thermal comfort requirements. When choosing between economy and comfort, the former group chose comfort, while the latter chose economy. Additionally, users who had high thermal comfort requirements needed to execute the content of the entire flow chart, while the second group skipped the content in the red dotted block diagram. Users with high thermal comfort requirements should control T cur t at [ T min t , T max t ], at the moment of high electricity price or at any other given moment. In cases where T cur t exceeds [ T min t , T max t ], T set t is set to T des t . On the other hand, to save operating costs, users with low thermal comfort requirements allow T cur t to exceed the range of [ T min t , T max t ] at times of high electricity prices. As illustrated in Fig. 4(a), under heating conditions in the winter P bid t > P e t . This may be caused by one of three situations: (1) T cur t is low, (2) air-conditioning users have high thermal comfort requirements, or (3) P e t is low. The above could also be the result of a random interaction of these three situations. To achieve T cur t > T cur t - 1 , the study calculates T set t through the ITC algorithm and makes T set t > T set t - 1 . However, when P bid t < P e t , this may be the result of one of three situations: (1) T cur t is high, (2) air-conditioning users have low thermal comfort requirements, or (3) P e t is high. Again, this situation could be the result of a random combination of the above three situations. The result of the ITC algorithm is T set t < T set t - 1 , which enables us to achieve T cur t < T cur t - 1 . The summer cooling conditions abide by the same theory as the winter heating conditions. When P bid t > P e t , as in Fig. 4(b), it may be caused by one of the three situations: (1) T cur t is high, (2) air-conditioning users have high thermal comfort requirements, or (3) P e t is low. This situation could also result from a random combination of the above three. Then, T set t can be calculated through the ITC algorithm, making T set t < T set t - 1 , and enabling T cur t < T cur t - 1 . Similarly, P bid t < P e t , may result from one of the three situations: (1) T cur t is low, (2) air-conditioning users have low thermal comfort requirements, or (3) P e t is high. Once again, this could also be the result or a random combination of the three situations. The result of the ITC algorithm is T set t > T set t - 1 , aiding to achieve T cur t > T cur t - 1 . Overall, the ITC method responds to the grid and regulates the air-conditioning system load by varying the room set-point temperature in real time. Furthermore, it determines the set-point temperature by comparing the user's bidding price and real-time price. Consequently, the grid and air-conditioning users just need to exchange real-time electricity prices and bidding electricity prices, then the privacy of air-conditioning users can be protected. With the ITC strategy, the bidding and user response processes are performed automatically through a programmable transactive controller. The only step users need to complete is setting their comfort preferences through the thermostat. Because of this, ITC has the potential to participate in smart buildings and smart grids, which are a crucial part of decarbonizing society and improving the efficiency, flexibility, and resilience of energy systems [38]. 2.4 Physics experiment platform 2.4.1 Building system The ITC strategy was tested on the \u201cfull-scale intelligent centralized energy storage air-conditioning experimental platform\u201d, situated on the first floor of the fourth teaching building of the West Campus at Chang'an University. The platform was an office building comprised of three air-conditioning rooms, namely 102E, 102W, and 103E. The location of the air-conditioning rooms is shown in Fig. 5 (a), while the indoor office equipment is illustrated in Fig. 5(b). Each room had a space of 64.8 m2 (7.2 m × 9.0 m) and a height of 3.7 m. Table 1 provides the detailed dimensional parameters of each room, while the relevant thermal parameters of the building envelope are shown in Table 2 . The load results suggested that the maximum cooling loads of 102E, 102W, and 103E were 6753.2 W, 6117.2 W, and 5825.5 W, respectively. On the other hand, the maximum heating loads of 102E, 102W, and 103E were 4013.9 W, 2506.1 W, and 3168.4 W, respectively. In this study, experimental studies of space cooling in the summer were conducted for room 102E and room 102W, and experimental studies of space heating in the winter were conducted only for 102E. In addition, a weather station was installed on the roof of teaching building No. 1. As this building is situated near the fourth teaching building, it allowed for the observation of meteorological parameters, such as air temperature, humidity, wind speed, wind direction, solar radiation and rainfall during the experiment. The station collected data every minute and averaged and recorded it every five minutes. 2.4.2 Air-conditioning system Fig. 6 illustrates the 3D model of the air-conditioning system. The central air-conditioning system consisted of an air source heat pump (ASHP), energy storage tank, variable frequency water pump, air handling unit (AHU), variable air volume box (VAV-box), and an automatic control system. Fig. 7 shows the object pictures of the main components of the experimental platform, while Table 3 provides the main equipment's parameters. The supply and return chilled water temperatures of the ASHP (as shown in Fig. 7(a)) in the cooling condition were 7 °C and 12 °C, while the cooling capacity was 28.9 kW. On the other hand, for the heating condition, the supply and return chilled water temperatures were 45 °C and 50 °C, while the heat capacity was 29.0 kW. As shown in Fig. 7(b), the heat transfer capacity of AHU's cooling coil was 15 kW. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 7(c). The energy storage tank functioned as a buffer water tank to avoid frequent start/stop of the ASHP and had a storage volume of 2.3 m3. The experimental platform was capable of realizing three forms of air-conditioning through switching valves: a constant air volume system, a variable air volume (VAV) system, and a primary air fan-coil system. Thus, the platform was adequate for researching various air-conditioning forms in air-conditioning rooms. As shown in Fig. 7(d), the present study was based on the VAV system. The VAV-box adopted a pressure-independent hot and cold type single duct variable air volume. Moreover, the air supply outlet contained a diffuser, while the return air inlet was designed in two forms: upper return air and lower return air. This platform did not have a dedicated room. As a result, AHU, the energy storage tank, the control cabinet and the electrical cabinet of the air-conditioning system were placed in the corridor, while ASHP was placed on the outdoor idle platform. 2.4.3 Automatic control system For real-time communication, the ITC strategy depended on the air-conditioning automatic control system. The automatic control system had installed various sensors that were required for the experiment. In order to maintain the room temperature within the thermal comfort range, the system programmed the ITC algorithm on the programmable logic controller (PLC) module. The automatic control system used the distributed control structure, which combines a host machine with a lower machine. The host machine is capable of running a number of algorithms used to control the air-conditioning system, one of them being the ITC strategy algorithm proposed in this work. In addition, the machine used LabVIEW to develop a human\u2013machine interface and to communicate with the programmable logic controller (PLC) or programmable software. This was done through an Ethernet exchange and with the help of OPC (object linking and embedding for process control, OPC) technology. Since PLC supported only simple algorithms, the ITC algorithms were written on a MATLAB programming software. The lower machine's data acquisition system consisted of Siemens PLC, an analog expansion module, an Ethernet module, and an 8-port industrial Ethernet switch. In order to communicate with the host machine and utilize the 485 bus to communicate with the on-site power module and instruments, the VAV-box temperature controller in the air-conditioning room employed both the BACnet protocol and the OPC technology. Flow, pressure, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and carbon dioxide concentration were all measured during the experiment. The sensors used to measure this data in the air-conditioning system included flow rate, pressure, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and CO2 sensors. Fig. 8 provides a layout of each sensor within the air-conditioning system, while the parameters of the sensors are shown in Table 4 . In addition to the sensors commonly used for measuring data within the air-conditioning system (shown in Fig. 8), the thermal index instrument HD32.3 (shown in Fig. 9 ) produced by the Deltaohm company was used to measure the predicted mean vote (PMV) and the predicted percentage of dissatisfaction (PPD). This instrument can evaluate the indoor thermal environment in real-time. The PMV-PPD index premeditates the three main factors (room temperature, humidity, and wind speed) that affect the human thermal sensation, while also considering secondary elements, such as the degree of human activity and clothing thermal resistance. In accordance with the international standard ISO7730 [39], when PMV is between −0.5 and 0.5, PPD cannot be greater than 10%, meaning that the comfort condition is at the first level. Secondly, when PMV is between −1 and 1, the PPD cannot be greater than 27%, indicating that the comfort condition is at the second-class level. When the HD32.3 thermal index instrument was used, the clothing thermal resistance (CLO) was 1.0, and the energy metabolic rate (Met) was 1.0. In the past, studies have used only room temperature to determine occupants' thermal comfort. However, other factors, such as wind speed, and humidity, may also affect thermal comfort. In order to better understand the actual thermal sensation of air-conditioning users, this paper used the PMV-PPD index to evaluate indoor thermal comfort during the winter. 2.5 Real-time electricity price In order to control the air-conditioning system, the ITC strategy is based on real-time electricity prices. Due to a lack of a real-time electricity price mechanism in China, the experiment employed real-time electricity price data from the PJM electricity market in the United States [40]. Fig. 10 shows four types of real-time electricity prices that were used in this study, namely A, B, C, and D. The peak electricity price periods of the four prices were shown to differ. For one, the peak electricity price of type A was concentrated mainly in the period of 11:25\u201316:05. Furthermore, the peak electricity price of type B was primarily situated in the periods between 12:30\u201312:45 and 16:45\u201317:35. Next, the peak electricity price of type C was concentrated predominantly in the period between 12:35\u201318:20. Finally, the peak electricity price for type D was concentrated in the periods of 8:05\u20138:35 and 16:55\u201317:55. Table 5 provides a statistical analysis of the four real-time electricity prices. Here, P mean and σ represent the mean value of the electricity price and the standard deviation of electricity price during the past 24 h. Next, the values of Ave, Max, and Min denote the average, maximum, and minimum of the current real-time electricity price. The average values of the four real-time electricity prices are quite similar. However, the maximum electricity prices exhibit a noticeable gap, in which type B shows the highest value, while type D shows the lowest. The difference between Type B and D is 0.1748 $/kWh. In addition, the maximum and minimum values of the same real-time electricity price differ. 3 Results and analysis As the electricity demand from air-conditioning systems continues to rise, it is becoming difficult to establish a balance between the power grid's supply and demand. In general, the DR is used either in high-temperature weather in the summer or in continuously low-temperature during the winter. This study examined two operating conditions of the air-conditioning system, namely space cooling in the summer and space heating in the winter. A field experiment and measurement experiments were designed for the ITC strategy for these two conditions. The focus for these two conditions was different. Namely, the summer condition compared the ITC strategy and conventional control strategy. It also focused on varying comfort factors and different thermal comfort requirements, with respect to the ITC strategy. Conversely, the winter conditions analyzed the ITC strategy with different market cycles and different demand-response periods. After, the temperature or PMV-PPD, operating cost, total power consumption, and load reduction at DR time, were used to evaluate the effects of the ITC strategy. Firstly, the study compared the change trends and four indicators under both the ITC and conventional control strategy. Secondly, it analyzed the impact of different users' comfort factors, thermal comfort requirements, market cycles, and DR periods on the operational results. 3.1 Cooling experiment 3.1.1 Experimental scheme of cooling condition The experiment selected four typical (Day1-Day4) summer days between mid-August and early September 2020 as the summer study period. The office hours were set from 9:00 to 18:00. Table 6 shows the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature ( T out ) of the four typical days. Within the range of allowable experimental error, Day1-Day4 may be considered comparative experiments conducted in the same outdoor air temperature. The value of each variable in Eq. (1) and the flow chart in Fig. 4(b) is as follows: Firstly, T des t was always 26 °C, Δ t =15 min, [ T min t , T max t ] = [24 °C, 28 °C], while ε 1 t and ε 2 t took the fixed values of 1 °C and 2 °C. Next, Δ P max t and Δ P min t were fixed at 30.0 $/MWh and 15.0 $/MWh, and Δ P c , max t was identical with Δ P max t . The k t value was set at either 1 or 2. Users were able to precool the room during the low electricity price period. The scheme of the four examined days is presented in Table 7 . To examine the difference between the ITC strategy and the conventional control strategy, three typical days (Day1, Day2 and Day3) used the ITC strategy, while only Day4 implemented the conventional control strategy. When using the ITC strategy, the set-point temperature was regulated by the ITC algorithm. On the other hand, the set-point temperature was fixed to 26 °C when the conventional control strategy was used. To study the influence of different k t values on the operation effect within the ITC strategy, the k t values of Day2 and Day3 were set to 2, while the k t value of Day1 was set to 1. Furthermore, in order to analyze the effects of ITC algorithms with high thermal comfort requirements and low thermal comfort requirements, two days (Day1 and Day2) used the algorithm with high thermal comfort requirements, while one (Day3) used the algorithm with low thermal comfort requirement. Lastly, to explore the ITC strategy's operation effect under different real-time electricity prices, the study selected three types of electricity prices namely A, B, and C. Day1-Day3 used all three types of electricity prices. Conversely, Day4 adopted a conventional control strategy, which was able to calculate the electricity cost of the air-conditioning system according to three electricity prices. The DR period in Table 7 was the DR period of the power grid and was specified by the power system. Furthermore, for the majority of cases, the power grid DR period represents the proper subset of the DR period of air-conditioning users introduced in Section 2.3.3. 3.1.2 Compare ITC strategy with conventional control strategy 3.1.2.1 Room temperature and set-point temperature Figs. 11-13 compare the room temperature ( T cur t ) and set-point temperature ( T set t ) between the ITC strategy of Day1-Day3 and the conventional control strategy of Day4. The period represented by the shadow portion of Figs. 11-13 represents the DR period of the power grid. The DR period of air-conditioning users is the period when T set t is valued at the maximum set-point temperature of 28 °C. Next, the low-price period (the precooling period) represents the period in which T set t is valued at the minimum set-point temperature of 24 °C. In the Figs. 11-13, the DR period of air-conditioning users and precooling period differ between different air-conditioning rooms. With the exception of Fig. 13(a), the power grid's DR period is included in the DR period of air-conditioning users in all other figures. In Fig. 11, the T cur t of room 102E is higher than that of room 102W. Furthermore, the DR period of air-conditioning users in room 102E is shorter than that of room 102W. These findings indicate that the ITC strategy is able to automatically identify the DR period of air-conditioning users based on their thermal comfort preferences and T cur t . Simultaneously, the ITC strategy also ensures that the DR period of the power grid is included in the DR period of air-conditioning users. Note that the T cur t of room 102E was sometimes significantly higher than the maximum T set t set by the user, as well as continuously high than the T cur t of room 102W. This occurrence is caused by the poor cooling effect of the experimental platform, the temperature measurement error of the room temperature sensor, and the fact that the air-conditioning load of room 102E was significantly greater than that of room 102W. The T set t of Day4, in which the conventional control strategy was employed was constant at 26 °C. By observing the T set t change curve for Day1-Day3 (with ITC strategy) in Figs. 11-13, we concluded that T set t is not a constant value under ITC control. Instead, it is adjusted according to the ITC algorithm once in each market cycle and is strictly controlled in the range of [ T min t , T max t ]. These findings indicate an essential difference between the ITC strategy and the conventional control strategy. In other words, T set t fluctuates with the fluctuations of electricity price within the ITC strategy. On the other hand, it is constant within the conventional control strategy. In addition, Figs. 11-13 suggest that the T set t in all rooms under the ITC strategy was small in the morning, approximately between 24 °C and 26 °C. In addition, in the morning, the T cur t under the ITC strategy was smaller than that under the conventional control strategy. In general, under the control of ITC, T set t was larger at either noon or in the afternoon, leading to a larger T cur t value during these periods. However, T cur t under the ITC strategy was not necessarily greater than T cur t under the conventional control strategy. Namely, the T set t was always set at 26 °C under conventional control, while the ITC method precooled the room during the low electricity price periods ( T set t takes the minimum set-point temperature T min t , and T min t set to 24 °C in summer). Thus, even if the increase in electricity prices causes T set t to take the maximum set-point temperature T max t ( T max t was 28 °C in the summer), precooling is able to keep the room temperature in a comfortable range for a certain period. For example, Fig. 12(b) shows Day2 between 13:30\u201315:30, when the room was precooled in advance by lowering the T set t , which in turn caused the room temperature to drop. Therefore, at the DR time of 17:00\u201317:45, the T set t was 28 °C. Even if the T cur t increased, it still remained significantly lower than that of Day4 without precooling. In addition, due to the precooling and thermal inertia of the building, T cur t tends to reach a phased maximum either during or after the DR. In Fig. 11(a), T cur t reaches a phased maximum after DR. Conversely, it reaches a phased maximum during the DR in Fig. 12(a) and 13(a). At the DR time, the ITC strategy reduces power consumption by increasing the T set t , generally up to T max t . However, under the conventional control strategy, T set t remains at 26 °C, meaning that the power consumption cannot be decreased. As shown in Figs. 11-13, T set t remains at 28 °C during the DR period from Day1 to Day3. The exception to this is when thermal comfort requirements are high and T cur t is higher than 28 °C (at 14:45\u201315:00 and 16:30\u201316:45 in Fig. 13(a)). 3.1.2.2 Bidding electricity price and real-time electricity price changes Fig. 14 illustrates the bidding electricity price and real-time electricity price of two air-conditioning rooms from Day1-Day3. The period represented by the shadow portion of Fig. 14 represents the DR period of the power grid. The P bid t of two air-conditioning rooms were recalculated according to Eq. (1) for each Δ t . The size of P bid t is related to every room's T cur t and users' comfort preferences ( T des t , k t and [ T min t , T max t ]). Thus, even during the same day and with the same real-time electricity price, the P bid t trend differs between two air-conditioning rooms. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 14, P bid t of room 102E is always higher than that of room 102W. The reason behind this result is twofold. Namely, it is due to a high T cur t and a large air-conditioning load of room 102E. Room 102E can obtain a low T set t and reduce T cur t only by increasing P bid t . On the other hand, the smaller T cur t of room 102W and the fact that a larger T set t is able to satisfy occupants' thermal comfort, results in a smaller P bid t . For instance, as shown in Fig. 14(a), the user of room 102W needs to bid for a smaller P bid t value, as this will result in the T set t value of the room remaining at 28 °C for nearly six hours (see Fig. 11(b)). However, by observing the T cur t curve, we find that T cur t always meets the indoor thermal comfort requirements. Thus, the ITC algorithm appears capable of bidding on P bid t according to the actual user needs. For instance, when the T cur t is higher, a user bids on a larger P bid t value in order to obtain a lower T set t value and reduce the T cur t . Conversely, in instances when the T cur t is lower or at T des t , the user may accept a higher T set t value or the same value as at time t - 1, so just bid for a smaller P bid t value. The P bid t value is related to the grid electricity price ( P mean ,σ). Therefore, while Day1-Day3 correspond to three kinds of P e t (A, B, and C), the P bid t trend of the same air-conditioning room under three distinct electricity prices also differs. While P bid t is lowest in the morning, it increases slowly and reaches its maximum at noon or during the afternoon. The reason for this is that the T cur t is smaller and the P e t is lower in the morning, making the users' P bid t small as a result. As the indoor air-conditioning load increases at noon and during the afternoon, both T cur t and P e t also gradually increase, resulting in P bid t increasing as well. Fig. 14 also shows that P bid t does not necessarily have to reach the maximum during the DR period. For instance, on Day1, rooms 102E and 102W (see Fig. 14(a)) both exhibited an increasing trend of P bid t value after DR. This shows that in order to reduce power consumption during the DR period, users will tend to reduce P bid t and increase T set t . While T cur t is quite high after DR, users will increase P bid t in order to reduce T set t and achieve a lower T cur t . 3.1.2.3 Changes in total power consumption As shown in Fig. 15 (a), the total power consumption of the air-conditioning system under the ITC strategy (Day1-Day3) is less than that under the conventional control strategy (Day4). This observation indicates that the ITC method is capable of reducing power consumption. Furthermore, Fig. 15(a) suggests that during the morning period between 9:00\u201310:20 of Day1-Day3, power consumption under ITC is more significant than that under conventional control strategy. This period is suggested to represent the trough period of electricity consumption, leading to low real-time electricity prices. Accordingly, the ITC algorithm reduces T set t to precool the room during the cheap electricity price period, which results in an increased power demand of the air-conditioning system. However, according to Fig. 15(a) and Table 7, the total power consumption of Day4 appears to be significantly greater than that of Day1-Day3, occurring mainly during the DR period. Furthermore, the high real-time electricity price may be due to the peak period of electricity consumption during the DR period. Accordingly, these observation implies that the ITC increased T set t not only reduces the electricity demand of the air-conditioning system and saves operating costs but realizes the demand response as well. In addition, Fig. 15(b) highlights the power consumption of the main equipment (ASHP, AHU, and variable frequency water pump). Namely, the ASHP was observed to consume the most energy, followed by the AHU (the power consumption of the AHU was mainly caused by the fan), and then the water pump. The ASHP power consumption varied significantly within both the ITC strategy and the conventional control strategy. Moreover, the total power consumption of Day4 is greater than that of Day1-Day3. This discrepancy is caused by the fact that the ASHP power consumption on Day4 was greater than that on Day1- Day3. Overall, the air-conditioning system controlled by the ITC strategy is able to precool a room during the low electricity price period. As a result, it increases the set-point temperature in order to reduce power consumption during the period of high electricity prices. The ITC strategy is proven to regulate the power demand of air-conditioning systems according to the real-time electricity price. 3.1.3 Different comfort factors and thermal comfort requirements under ITC strategy As shown in Table 7, Day1-Day3 differ in their comfort factors ( k t ) value and thermal comfort requirements. Therefore, the T cur t changes of room 102E during this period are used the examine the impact of users' k t values and thermal comfort requirements on the operating results. The k t value for Day2 is largerthan that of Day1. Thus, the time when the T set t vaule of Day2 (Fig. 12) was set at the maximum temperature (28 °C) is significantly shorter than that of Day1 (Fig. 11). In addition, the duration of T cur t exceeding 28 °C on Day2 is shorter than that on Day1, as illustrated in Fig. 16 . This proves a larger k t value is linked to higher levels of user thermal comfort. The k t value of Day2 and Day3 was 2. However, Day2 exhibits low thermal comfort requirements, while Day3 exemplifies high ones. Even though Table 7 shows that the total DR time of Day3 is greater than that of Day2, Fig. 16 indicates that the duration of T cur t exceeding 28 °C on Day3 is shorter than that on Day2. Due to the poor cooling effect of the experimental platform, T cur t of Day1- Day3 cannot be controlled and kept within the range of [ T min t , T max t ]. As mentioned above, this means that indoor thermal comfort is better guaranteed when users set the thermal comfort requirement to high rather than to low. 3.1.4 Operation effect of different days Table 8 summarizes the power consumption and operating cost for the DR time, as well as the total power consumption, total operating cost, and room temperature of Day1-Day3 with different operation strategies and Day4 with the conventional control strategy. The percentages are calculated by comparing days with the ITC strategy (Day1-Day3) to the day with the conventional control strategy (Day4). Only the days which employed the ITC strategy corresponding to the percentage, while Day4 does not have this value. A positive percentage indicates that the value is reduced compared with the conventional control strategy. Conversely, a negative percentage points to an increased in value, compared with the conventional control strategy. In addition, the influence on room temperature is represented by the average value of ( T cur t -28) in room 102E. Table 8 shows that the power consumption and operating cost of Day1 and Day2 during the DR period were both reduced by over 50%. These findings suggest that the ITC strategy is capable of responding to the grid's power load and reducing the operating cost at the DR time. The increase in operating costs and power consumption during Day3 (with ITC strategy) in the DR period may be the result of the outdoor temperature, which was 0.66 °C and 0.71 °C higher than during Day1 and Day2. In other words, the increase in temperature may have led to a higher air-conditioning load of Day3. Furthermore, due to the poor cooling effect, the air-conditioning load of Day3 was always large, while the room temperature was high. As a result, the air-conditioning system still needed to run at full load operation even if the T set t of Day3 is increased to T max t at the time of DR which is the same as the T set t of Day3 being kept as T des t in the conventional control strategy. In addition, the power consumption for Day3 in the DR period cannot be reduced. Table 8 further demonstrates that the total power consumption and total operating cost of Day1-Day3 all decreased after applying the ITC strategy. Moreover, the average value of ( T cur t -28) in room 102E during Day1-Day3 was closer to the indoor thermal comfort range than that of Day4. In order to determine the reliability of the measurements, an additional general uncertainty analysis [41] was performed. The uncertainty values of the room temperature measured in room 102E from Day1-Day4 were 0.021, 0.018, 0.017, and 0.015, respectively. Next, the uncertainty values of the room temperature measured in room 102W from Day1-Day4 were 0.012, 0.011, 0.014, and 0.012, respectively. In sum, the ITC strategy managed to reduce the total power consumption and total operating cost of the air-conditioning system, while also ensuring better indoor thermal comfort than the conventional control strategy. The total power consumption reduction and total operating cost reduction for Day2 ( k t =2) are both smaller than that for Day1 ( k t =1). Furthermore, the average value of ( T cur t -28) in room 102E on Day2 is closer to indoor optimal thermal comfort than the value of Day1. This observation suggests that a higher comfort factor would create a better indoor thermal environment, but lead to greater power consumption and higher operating cost. The average value of ( T cur t -28) on Day3 with high thermal comfort requirements is closer to [ T min t , T max t ] than that on Day2 with low thermal comfort requirements. Although, the total power consumption reduction of Day 3 is similar to that of Day 2. However, the total operating cost reduction on Day3 is smaller than that of Day2. This suggests that higher thermal comfort requirements guarantee better indoor thermal comfort but lead to greater higher operating cost. 3.2 Heating experiment Due to continuously low temperatures during the winter, the heating power load of air-conditioning continues to rise. Therefore, it is necessary to examine the demand response of the heating condition of air-conditioning system in the winter. Because of the poor cooling effect in the cooling experiment, the room temperature of room 102E, which had a large air-conditioning load was difficult to maintain within the thermal comfort range. The main reasons for the poor performance of the air-conditioning system were determined during the winter experiment, and the heating effect of the system was partially improved. Even though there is still a difference between the set value and the actual room temperature value, the room temperature during the winter experiment could be maintained within the thermal comfort zone. 3.2.1 Experimental scheme of heating condition Four typical winter days from December 2020 to January 2021 were selected for the heating condition experiment. Table 9 illustrates the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature ( T out ) of the four days. The office hours in the winter experiment were the same as those in the summer experiment. The value of each variable in Eq. (2) and flow chart Fig. 4(a) during the heating experiment is as follows: T des t was always 21 °C, while [ T min t , T max t ] was equal to [19 °C, 23 °C]. Next, the values of ε 1 t , ε 2 t , Δ P max t , Δ P min t and Δ P c t , k t during the winter were equal to those in the summer condition. The users were permitted to preheat the room during the low electricity price period. The experiment scheme of the four days is provided in Table 10 . The PMV-PPD is capable of indicating the indoor thermal comfort in the heating experiment. In order to examine the effect of different k t values on indoor thermal comfort with the ITC strategy, Day1, when k t was set to 1 was compared with Day2, when k t was set to 2. The market cycle ( Δ t ) on Day1 and Day3 was 15 and 5 min, respectively. These two days were compared to study the impact of different market cycles on the operation effect. Furthermore, in order to compare the impact of the ITC strategy in mid-term DR (DR time exceeding 120 min but less than 240 min) and short-term DR (DR time less than 60 min), Day3 of mid-term DR and Day4 of short-term DR were compared. The DR time of Day3 was from 15:15 to 18:00 and equaled a total of 165 min. On the other hand, the DR time of Day4 was from 17:00 to 18:00 and equaled a total of 60 min. The DR period in Table 10 represents the DR period of the power grid, and not that of air-conditioning users. 3.2.2 Different comfort factors under ITC strategy The analysis of the summer data showed that a larger comfort factor ( k t ) value would gain higher indoor thermal comfort with the ITC strategy but would also result in higher power consumption. In order to determine whether the effect of different k t values in winter is consistent with those in summer, two typical winter days with different k t values were examined (the k t of Day1 was 1, and the k t of Day2 set at 2). To evaluate indoor thermal comfort, the HD32.3 thermal index device measured the PMV-PPD. The PMV-PPD is a better indicator of occupants' natural thermal comfort than room temperature. Fig. 17 shows the thermal comfort PMV-PPD curve of Day1-Day2 in room 102E. The PMV curve of Day1 and Day2 were found to continuously rise from 9:00 to 11:00, while the PPD curve continued to decline. This is due to the fact that the air-conditioning system is not turned on before 9:00 and the room temperature is low. Thus, the PMV and PPD curves deviate from the indoor thermal comfort range. After 9:00, the air-conditioning system begins to work, and the indoor air parameters slowly approach the indoor thermal comfort range, resulting in the PMV and PPD curves presenting a changing trend. Due to the ITC strategy of adjusting the room set-point temperature every Δ t time, the curves continuously fluctuate within the thermal comfort range once the PMV and PPD pass their first peak value. The DR period of Day1 and Day2 is 15:15\u201318:00. Fig. 17 shows that the PMV and PPD values of Day2 and Day1 both remain at thermal comfort level I during the DR period. This indicates the k t value of either 1 or 2 can ensure indoor thermal comfort under ITC strategy during DR time. Moreover, by observing the fluctuation trend of the PMV and PPD curves, the study concludes that the PMV and PPD curves of Day2 ( k t set at 2) are closer to the indoor thermal comfort range than Day1 ( k t set at 1). In addition, the PMV and PPD values of two days are statistically analyzed. The average values of PMV and PPD on Day1 are −0.54 and 11.85%. On the other hand, the average values of PMV and PPD on Day2 are −0.19 and 6.11%. The average values of PMV and PPD differ significantly between the two days. More specifically, the average PMV and PPD values on Day2 are better at ensuring thermal comfort than those of Day1. Therefore, the influence of the k t value on indoor thermal comfort in winter is consistent with the summer conditions. In other words, a higher k t value is linked to better occupants' thermal comfort. 3.2.3 Different market cycles under ITC strategy In the summer experiment, the market cycle ( Δ t ) was 15 min. In order to study the impact of different market cycles on the operation effect within the ITC strategy, the Δ t of Day3 was set to 5 min, while the Δ t of Day1 was set to 15 min in the winter experiment. Fig. 18 shows the T set t and P bid t curve of room 102E on Day1 and Day3. The Δ t of Day1 is 15 min, meaning that the T set t and P bid t were adjusted every 15 min according to the ITC algorithm. On the other hand, the Δ t of Day3 was 5 min, meaning that the T set t and P bid t were adjusted every 5 min. Thus, Fig. 18 shows that the number of T set t adjustments and P bid t bidding during office hours on Day3 was larger than on Day1. When Δ t was set to 5 min, the power grid and air-conditioning users could communicate with each other 12 times per hour. When Δ t was set to 15 min, they could communicate with each other only 4 times per hour. Thus, the number of communications between the power grid and air-conditioning users when Δ t was set to 5 min was more frequent than when Δ t was set to 15 min. Furthermore, when the Δ t was 5 min, air-conditioning users could adjust their electricity consumption habits more often based on electricity price information. As shown in Table 11 , the operation effects of Day1 and Day3 are analyzed through six different indicators: power consumption during the DR period, operating cost during the DR period, total power consumption, total operating cost, PMV, and PPD. Except for the PPD value, which is measured, the percentages of all other indicators are calculated by comparing Day3 to Day1. Thus, only Day3 values correspond to the percentages, while Day1 does not have these values. In cases where the percentage value is positive, the value of Day3 is over that of Day1. Conversely, when the percentage value is negative, the value of Day3 is less than that of Day1. Table 11 shows that the power consumption on Day3 with a Δ t value of 5 min is lower than that on Day1 when Δ t is set to 15 min. Furthermore, on Day3, the power consumption reduction of DR period and total power consumption reduction are 28.75% and 9.70%, respectively. Thus, when compared with a Δ t of 15 min, a Δ t of 5 min is able to save more power consumption during the DR period and office hours. According to operating costs provided in Table 11, the operating cost during the DR period and the total operating cost of Day3 are less than those of Day1. In addition, on Day3, the total operating cost reduction and the operating cost reduction during the DR period are 23.27% and 42.76%, respectively. In other words, setting Δ t to 5 min during both the DR period and office hours in total could save more operating costs than setting Δ t to 15 min. Next, Fig. 19 shows the PMV-PPD values of room 102E on Day1 and Day3. The uncertainty values of the PMV in room 102E from Day1 and Day3 were 0.008 and 0.009, respectively. The uncertainty values of the PPD in room 102E from Day1 and Day3 were 0.235 and 0.228, respectively. Even though both the PMV and PPD values of Day1 and Day3 are within the thermal comfort range after 10:00 (including the DR period from 15:15 to 18:00), a Δ t of 5 min ensures the indoor thermal comfort range better than that of 15 min. Furthermore, as shown in Table 11, the average PMV and PPD values of Day3 are closer to the best indoor thermal comfort range than on Day1. In sum, whether it is DR time or non-DR time, a Δ t of 5 min is capable of ensuring indoor thermal comfort better than Δ t set to 15 min. In other words, a smaller market cycle reduces the time it takes the transactive controller to read the power grid information and the user's room temperature and other indoor air-conditioning parameters. The ITC algorithm is used to adjust the user's room set-point temperature to respond to the power grid in real-time. Thus, a smaller Δ t value is capable of ensuring better indoor thermal comfort. In conclusion, when the Δ t has smaller value, air-conditioning users are able to respond to the power grid more frequently and adjust their electricity consumption behavior. Furthermore, they are able to adjust the electricity consumption behavior from the time of high electricity prices to the time of low price, as well as ensure the amount of electricity reduction during the DR period. Therefore, when the market cycle is smaller, the response effect of the DR period is better guaranteed, while the total power consumption and operating cost are effectively reduced. 3.2.4 Different DR periods under ITC strategy In order to study the ITC strategy's operating effect in different demand response periods, two typical winter days (Day3 and Day4) were further analyzed. Day3 applied mid-term DR (the DR period was 15:15\u201318:00, while the DR duration was 165 min), while Day4 applied short-term DR (the DR time was 17:00\u201318:00, while the DR duration was 60 min). Fig. 20 presents the PMV-PPD values on Day3 and Day4 in room 102E. The PMV-PPD value on Day3 is closer to the indoor thermal comfort range than on Day4 before 12:00. This may be the result of slightly higher outdoor temperature of Day3 than that of Day4. Furthermore, Table 9 shows that the average value of outdoor temperature during office hours on Day3 was 3.84 °C higher than that of Day4. However, the PMV-PPD values on Day4 are closer to the indoor thermal comfort range than on Day3 after 12:00. This is due to the fact that Day3 starts its demand response at 15:15, while the ITC algorithm responds to the power grid by lowering the room set-point temperature, and the DR duration of Day3 is 165 min. Conversely, the demand response of Day4 starts at 17:00, making its demand response time shorter than that of Day3. Furthermore, except for the first 30 min when the air-conditioning system begins to work, the indoor thermal environment can be maintained within the thermal comfort range for all other office hours (including DR period), whether Day3 with mid-term DR or Day4 with short-term DR. At the same time, Table 12 shows that the average PMV values on Day3 and Day4 do not differ significantly. The uncertainty PMV and PPD values in room 102E from Day4 were 0.014 and 0.357, respectively. The average PPD value on Day3 was closer to thermal comfort than that of Day4. Furthermore, the average PMV and PPD values on Day4 and Day3 are both within the thermal comfort range. The DR time of Day3 is longer than that of Day4, making the power consumption and operating cost during the DR period on Day3 larger than those of Day4. However, the total power consumption and total operating cost of Day3 are still smaller than those of Day4. This may be due to the fact that the average value of outdoor temperature during office hours on Day3 was 3.84 °C higher than that of Day4. However, a more evident reason is that the Day3 DR duration is greater than the DR duration of Day4. During the DR period, the air-conditioning system reduces power consumption by increasing the set-point temperature. Thus, a longer DR time would save more power consumption and operating cost. In summary, applying the ITC strategy to both short-term and medium-term DR projects ensures indoor thermal comfort. In addition, the total power consumption of the medium-term DR projects is significantly less than those in short-term DR projects. 4 Conclusions Based on the traditional transactive control (TC) strategy, this research proposed a simplified improved transactive control (ITC) method capable of determining the set-point temperature by comparing the bidding price and real-time price. In order to examine the ITC strategy, two field experiments (under space cooling in the summer and space heating in the winter conditions) were carried out on a full-size centralized energy storage air-conditioning system. The results showed that the ITC strategy is able to achieve demand response and reduce the total power consumption of the air-conditioning system. In addition, under the premise of protecting users' privacy and respecting their' personalized thermal comfort preferences, this strategy is capable of decreasing the total operating cost. Simultaneously, the strategy guarantees indoor thermal comfort better than the conventional control strategy. Moreover, the ITC strategy caused the set-point temperature change with the fluctuation of the market electricity price. Namely, to make full use of the low electricity price during the low electricity consumption period, it precooled the room by lowering the set-point temperature in cooling conditions and preheated the room by increasing the set-point temperature in heating conditions. In order to reduce the electricity demand of the air-conditioning system, the ITC strategy increases the set-point temperature for space cooling and decreases the set-point temperature for space heating during the peak period of electricity consumption. Therefore, the ITC strategy is capable of regulating the electricity demand of the air-conditioning system based on the real-time electricity price. This study examined the ITC strategy of a central air-conditioning system. Future work should apply the ITC strategy to multiple air-conditioning systems with large building volumes, as well as to a wider array of users, and various air-conditioning rooms. Further studies could also formulate the demand response strategy based on transactive control applicable to buildings groups that need to participate in the demand response through the load aggregator.

        "dc:description": "At present, transactive control (TC) represents a novel demand response control method. As traditional TC strategies are incapable of determining the market-clearing price, the room set-point temperature cannot be calculated. Therefore, this study proposes a simplified improved transactive control (ITC) method for the demand response (DR) needs of air-conditioning systems. The relationship between the real-time electricity price and the user's bidding electricity price determines the set-point temperature of the ITC method. In addition to this, this method's control process is both simple and easy to implement. In order to test this method, the study conducted field experiments on a full-scale variable air volume air-conditioning platform. Four typical summer days were selected for the space cooling experiment. Of the four, three adopted the ITC strategy, while one adopted the conventional control strategy. Another typical four days were selected for the space heating experiment in winter, and all adopted the ITC strategy. Several conclusions are drawn after comparing the ITC strategy to the conventional control strategy. For one, after adopting the ITC strategy, the maximum energy consumption reduction and saving operating costs in the DR period reached 59.29% and 66.12%, respectively. Furthermore, the total energy consumption reduction was 7.49\u201313.72%, while the saving total operating costs were 6.19\u201330.80%. After adopting the ITC strategy, the room temperature of the air-conditioning room was closer to the acceptable indoor thermal comfort range than in the case of the conventional control strategy. Together, these results suggested that the ITC strategy is an efficient demand response method for air-conditioning systems.",
