BIST Lab, Department of Global Smart City Sungkyunkwan University Suwon 16419 Republic of Korea A virtual model that mathematically represents operational behaviors is essential for implementing the concepts of digital twins (DTs) and building information modeling (BIM) to achieve intelligent, optimal building operations. However, current research lacks an approach to reliably construct virtual models. This paper introduces a concept named virtual in-situ modeling (VIM), designed to comprehensively represent building behaviors. The VIM framework is based on five key aspects: modeling environments, model types, modeling sources, modeling approaches, and model fusion techniques. VIM bridges BIM and DT, enabling virtual modeling during the operational phase and enhancing both BIM-based DT and DT-enhanced BIM. Case studies conducted using real building operations demonstrate the effectiveness of VIM, achieving a highly accuracy (RMSE of 0.24 °C). Additionally, the VIM-assisted fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) provided early detection and diagnostic estimation, outperforming FDD without the virtual model. This paper highlights the potential of VIM for advanced building operations and maintenance.

There is a growing emphasis on improving the energy efficiency of buildings because of rising concerns about energy consumption and carbon emissions [2]. The push for carbon neutrality further underscores the importance of sustainable building lifecycles. Initiatives such as RE100 [3], which encourage companies to commit to using 100% renewable energy, highlight the role of building operations in achieving this goal. The business world's focus on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) [4] factors places building operations in the spotlight because they directly impact the \u201cenvironmental\u201d aspect of ESG. The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) [5] stress the need for sustainable cities and communities, emphasizing the role of efficient building operations. In these contexts, energy-efficient and sustainable building operations not only minimize environmental impacts but also significantly contribute to the well-being of occupants and indoor environmental quality. As the challenges in building operations increase, particularly concerning energy efficiency and sustainability, decision-making in building operations and lifecycle management has become a multifaceted challenge. This issue goes beyond simple actions such as turning lights on or off; it involves comprehending the interactions among all building components and lifecycle stages (e.g., design, construction, and commissioning) and considering external factors such as energy sources and environmental concerns. This adds intricacy to building operations and management. Therefore, to navigate this complexity and make well-informed decisions, it is crucial to possess an operational understanding of a building's physical behavior and its current condition. Just as a doctor requires a comprehensive view of a patient's health to provide the best care, those responsible for buildings need a thorough understanding of their functionality to ensure optimal decisions and operations. Building digitalization can provide a comprehensive digital infrastructure for intelligent and optimal building operations [6\u20138]. Related concepts contribute to building digitalization, including building information modeling (BIM), digital twins (DTs), and cyber-physical systems (CPSs) [8]. According to a literature review comparing similar concepts in the built environment [8,9], BIM is described as an extension of the O&M phase through the construction phase based on building information from the design phase, while DTs are depicted as focusing on the O&M phase and aiming for an optimal design based on insights gained through comprehensive operations. By definition, CPS refers to the integration of computational systems (cyber) with physical processes, where embedded computers monitor and control physical processes [10]. In the building sector, CPS emphasizes optimal control from an information and communication perspective, although it is applied in a somewhat narrower dimension compared to DTs. The integration of BIM and the CPS framework holds the potential to improve building performance through digitalization [11]. In BIM, the geometrical and semantic models of a building are crucial, whereas in a DT, mathematical models describing the physics and behaviors of the building are essential. BIM models are relatively static, whereas DT models are more dynamic in terms of the building lifecycle. In this context, BIM and DTs can be mutually synergistic, contributing to the role of digital infrastructure for holistic, intelligent, and optimal building operations [9,12,13]. The integration of BIM and DT can realize their aim of covering the full building lifecycle [9]. Specifically, the original concept of a DT [14] is defined as \u201ca set of virtual information constructs that fully describes a potential or actual physical manufactured product from the micro atomic level to the macro geometrical level.\u201d This definition represents a rather ideal and omniscient concept of DT. It is basically composed of three elements: a physical entity, a virtual model, and their automated flow of data and information between them [15]. Considering the definition and architecture of DT, it is crucial to expand both the sensing coverage in a physical entity and the behavioral model coverage in a virtual model to attain full DT status. In the manufacturing industry, Tao et al. [16] conducted research on digital twin modeling, especially for virtual models, and stressed the significance of transitioning from a conventional viewpoint, primarily focusing on virtual model construction, to considering six aspects (model construction, model assembly, model fusion, model verification, model modification, and model management). Furthermore, Song et al. [17] proposed a digital twin modeling approach that treats existing digital twin models as DT assets and leverages their reuse to enhance modeling efficiency and resilience. Compared to the manufacturing field, constructing and managing virtual models, especially for physical behavioral models, in the building industry presents an inherent set of challenges. Given that buildings are differently designed and then constructed on site, establishing a controlled experimental setting, akin to a laboratory and manufacturing facility, is not straightforward for the mathematical modeling for building operational behaviors. Even if such a setting were feasible, each building is inherently unique owing to its design, construction uncertainties, operational characteristics, and aging issues. Most importantly, the physical environment within a building is primarily created after construction, during its operational phase. In the context of built environments, Yoon [18] emphasized the importance of an in-situ modeling perspective and investigated corresponding modeling methodologies to construct accurate behavioral models in building operations. Based on this perspective, the concept of in-situ digital twinning was introduced for building digital twins in [19], where the in-situ modeling of virtual models during building operations was highlighted in three aspects: (1) digital twin elements, (2) functional requirements, and (3) enabling techniques. Furthermore, in-situ model fusion techniques have been explored to build, verify/validate, calibrate, and integrate each virtual model within the digital twin modeling process [20]. These modeling approaches rely on sensor deployment in building operations, with the DT being required to encompass unobserved areas through virtual models constructed via in-situ modeling. However, because of the enormous sizes of buildings, the areas that can be observed through sensor networks are limited. Consequently, conducting in-situ modeling of unobserved areas poses a significant challenge. Although some research has explored the in-situ modeling perspective in the building sector [21\u201325], the endeavor of creating a virtual building during its operation is still relatively unexplored, rife with challenges and opportunities. In the realms of BIM, DTs, and their integration, there exists a knowledge gap regarding the construction of reliable and comprehensive virtual models during target building operations in the built environment sector. Therefore, this paper introduces the concept of \u2018virtual in-situ modeling\u2019 (VIM) for advanced O&M by bridging the gap between DT and BIM. VIM aims to mathematically construct a virtual model that comprehensively describes target building behaviors and physical relationships for operations, using the in-situ modeling and model fusion process proposed with the available modeling sources and BIM. To achieve this, the VIM framework and methodology were established based on five aspects: modeling environments, model types, modeling sources, modeling approaches, and model fusion techniques. As shown in Fig. 1 , VIM can play a role in both the BIM and DT contexts: \u2022 From the BIM perspective: It contributes to establishing mathematical models describing operational behaviors and physical relationships between data and information in the operational phase of BIM, leveraging a virtual model in the DT model. VIM-assisted BIM can mathematically represent physical behaviors during the operational stage. \u2022 From the DT perspective: It provides methods for constructing a virtual model within the building's DT model during target building operations, using the design and operational information obtained from BIM. VIM-assisted DT offers a more comprehensive, informative, and reliable DT environment than sensor-based DT, shifting closer to full DT status. Overall, VIM serves as a bridge between BIM and DT by enabling virtual modeling during the operational phase. This contribution enhances the concepts of both BIM-based DT and DT-enhanced BIM. In the remainder of the paper, literature reviews are conducted in Section 2, and Section 3 introduces the concept of VIM, including related terms and definitions. Section 4 proposes the VIM framework, and Section 5 presents the modeling methodology for VIM. Section 6 describes case studies conducted using real building operations to demonstrate the effectiveness of VIM. Section 7 showcases the VIM-driven virtual models and FDD performance, and Section 8 discusses the achievements, limitations, and future directions of the study. The Conclusion summarizes this study. 2 Literature review 2.1 BIM and DT for operation and maintenance Building management systems (BMS) or building automation systems (BAS) are equipped to operate, control, and manage operational building systems. BMS provide facility managers (FM) with the building's operational data and information. However, traditional BMS have limitations in providing comprehensive and advanced functions for building O&M [26\u201328]. Therefore, recently, the connections and integrations of BIM and DT have been studied with advanced sensing, data analytics, and data-driven modeling methods using BMS and its operational data and information in the O&M sector [9,19,29]. For example, Hosamo et al. [28] developed a DT-based predictive maintenance framework for air handling units based on the data obtained from BIM, sensors, building management systems (BMS) in the context of facility management. Hu and Assaad [30] proposed a DT model for real-time indoor environmental monitoring and visualization, utilizing the BIM information and interface environment provided in BIM software. Xie et al. [31] developed a DT-enabled fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) method for excessive infiltration and sensor faults for operational building HVAC systems, using the semantics available in BIM models. Lu et al. [32] proposed a DT-enabled anomaly detection system for built assets in the building O&M based on extended industry foundation classes (IFC) for the DT construction and data integration. Wang et al. [33] suggested a DT-enabled built environmental sensing and monitoring in the context of COVID through the data integration between IFC and SensorML data schema. These studies typically leveraged BIM information (e.g., geometry, semantics, and asset properties) and BIM interfaces (e.g., Revit and Dynamo) to establish DT environments with the existing BMS, especially for data interfaces, three-dimensional virtual models for physical entities, and visualization. The analysis information from the DT-enabled applications is then updated into the BIM models. However, these O&M applications using BIM-enabled DT environments have still been mostly focused on indoor and built environmental monitoring, visualization, and fault and anomaly detection, which primarily rely on sensor data rather than on dynamic behavioral models for building operations. 2.2 Virtual models for physical and dynamic behaviors Virtual models in the digital twin concept consist of different types, such as geometric, physical, behavioral, and rule models [16]. When implementing digital twin-based applications, it is important to determine in advance which type of virtual model is needed [34]. Although the existing BIM and DT-enable O&M applications require more geometric, semantic, and rule-based models, advanced applications (e.g., virtual sensing [7,24,35], DT simulation [36], predictive maintenance [28], optimal control [37], and fault diagnosis and estimation [38]) demand more extensive and reliable physical and dynamic behavioral models for BIM and DT environments because they rely on physical relationships, behaviors, and knowledge for building operations. Therefore, a virtual model representing physical and dynamic behaviors for building operations needs to be considered more important in BIM and DT models [19]. In other engineering fields that emphasize the dynamic behavior of systems (e.g., structural [39], material [40], robotic [41], and electrical [42]), a virtual model has been defined as a mathematical model that describes the physical behavior of the system or a mathematical model of the relationship between the system's inputs and responses. Therefore, virtual modeling refers to the concept of mathematically, numerically, and computationally modeling these virtual models. For example, Feng et al. [43] proposed a dynamic virtual modeling technique for geometric-material nonlinear dynamics of practical structures (wind turbine and human bone) using machine learning. The terminological distinction between virtual modeling and traditional physical modeling of the system's behavior can be considered in the following contexts: \u2022 Focus on data-driven or advanced modeling approaches, in addition to physics, in the modeling process for virtual models that very closely represent the behavior of the actual system; \u2022 Utilization of virtual simulations regarding actual system behavior and interaction between virtual and real environments based on virtual models; and \u2022 Connection with the concept of digital twins. 2.3 Virtual building models (VBM) for built environments In the building and construction sector, Yoon [44] introduced the concept of virtual building models (VBM), defined as mathematical models that represent the physical behavior of operational buildings. This virtual model focuses more on mathematical, physical, and dynamic behavior models than on other models (e.g., geometry and rules) within the BIM and DT models. The VBM is composed of sub-virtual models (observed, unobserved, and designed), and the level of detail (LOD) of VBM is categorized into five levels, progressing from the designed model to a fully detailed in-situ operational representation. The primary goal of VBM is to provide insights into the behavior and operational status of real buildings beyond the textural, geometrical, and static information. Modeling methodologies for VBM have been developed based on the concept of in situ modeling. In situ modeling is defined as the process of developing mathematical behavioral models in target building operations to produce more accurate in situ models than designed models constructed outside the target building operations (e.g., different buildings, modeling environments, and periods) [18]. This modeling methodology takes into account the long operational life cycle of buildings, large scale, on-site physical behaviors, and the constraints of establishing a laboratory environment for modeling. It involves the mathematical in situ process of correcting uncertainties in the operational stage of physics-based models and the data-driven modeling process based on sensor data for real building operations. In these contexts, Choi and Yoon [23] proposed an in-situ modeling method integrating physics, data fusion, and surrogate modeling to predict the physical variable unobserved by a sensor for building HVAC operations. Koo and Yoon [45] developed a simultaneous in-situ calibration method for physical sensors and virtual behavioral models towards DT-enabled building HVAC operations. These existing studies focused more on the accuracy and validation of mathematical modeling but lacked integration and connection within BIM and DT environments. 2.4 Knowledge gaps and motivations Based on the literature review, the knowledge gaps between BIM and DT for their integration, enabling advanced applications in building O&M, can be summarized as follows: (1) There is a lack of mathematical virtual models representing physical behavioral models for building O&M in both DT and BIM contexts. Consequently, there is an absence of information exchange regarding these virtual models and their modeling for building operations. (2) The current research is still significantly lacking in virtual modeling methods and frameworks for constructing behavioral models for building operations within BIM and DT environments. (3) For the efficient operation and management of integrated BIM and DT environments, it is necessary to distinguish between application algorithms and virtual models describing physical behaviors and to view these models as digital assets. To address the knowledge gaps between BIM and DT, this paper proposes a concept and framework of VIM to mathematically construct physical behavioral models in the field for building operations. This aims to enhance the integration of BIM and DT for advanced operations and maintenance (O&M) with reliable and extensive physical behavioral models. 3 Virtual in-situ modeling (VIM) 3.1 Concept This section proposes a concept of virtual in-situ modeling (VIM) based on the context of VBM for BIM and DT. VIM is defined as a mathematical modeling process for constructing, verify/validating, calibrating, and extending virtual models during target building operations using data, information, and prebuilt models obtained through the building lifecycle in BIM and/or DT environments. The primary objective of VIM is to establish a virtual building that offers (1) a more extensive behavioral model environment than what is covered by sensors and (2) a more reliable behavioral model environment compared to models constructed externally to the target building's operations, such as built-in models from source buildings, different modeling environments, and different periods. A VIM-driven virtual building serves as the foundation for holistic observation, fault detection and diagnosis, prediction and simulation, and optimal control in the context of advanced O&M. VIM pursues an on-site, online, real-time, automated, simultaneous, continuous, and autonomous modeling process tailored for target building operations. Fig. 2 illustrates the concept of VIM for building operations. To achieve this, VIM must recognize the constraints of the modeling environment within the target building operations. This modeling process should also consider incorporating data and information gathered throughout the building's lifecycle, as well as from other buildings and environments. Consequently, it is crucial to emphasize the model transitions in the following areas [18]: 1. From the design phase to building operation, 2. From source buildings to target buildings, 3. From ideal modeling settings, such as laboratories or manufacturing facilities, to on-site modeling environments, and 4. From a one-time modeling approach to continuous modeling throughout the building's lifecycle. 3.2 Terms and definitions In this study, virtual models from the perspectives of DT and BIM are limited to mathematical models that describe the physical behavior during the operational phase of buildings. In this context, there are three terms to be explained for the concept of VIM, as follows: \u2022 Virtual: This term refers to mathematical targets and activities for virtual building models that represent operational building behaviors within the concepts of DT and BIM. \u2022 In-situ: This term denotes the actual building operational environment, rather than the design and construction stages, experimental environments, or other buildings. This concept is important for advancing DT-enabled building simulation and control. \u2022 Modeling: This term refers to the process of mathematically constructing virtual models that represent physical behaviors for building operations using available modeling sources from BIM and DT environments. This concept allows BIM to be extended into the realm of behavioral modeling. In the context of the proposed VIM, new terms related to in-situ modeling perspectives are defined in this section. First, the models described in this study refer to mathematical representations that describe the physical behavior of a system using mathematical concepts and language. In-situ models are defined as on-site models constructed for target building operations using the proposed VIM method. For model verification and validation (V&V), the conventional concept is intended to provide a quantified level of agreement between the experimental data and model prediction, as well as the predictive accuracy of the model [46]. In the context of VIM in real building operations, in-situ model verification and validation refer to the process of determining the model accuracy using operational data, rather than the experimental data used in the conventional concept, in real operational environments. Thus, assessing in-situ V&V environments is necessary to ensure the reliability of the sensor data used for modeling and understanding system operational conditions. In-situ verification is conducted within the modeling process, and in-situ validation can be conducted for real operations after model implementation. Direct V&V refers to the process of direct comparison using model output observations. Indirect V&V refers to the process of indirect comparison for the reference model output that is mathematically related to the target model, rather than the target model output comparisons. This specific approach is explained in Section 4.5.1. Finally, the in-situ model performance is quantified by the model random error, model systematic error (bias), and the number of datasets used to satisfy the intended model accuracy, as shown in Fig. 3 . 4 Framework This section provides the VIM framework to mathematically implement the proposed concept of VIM in the DT and BIM environments for advanced O&M. The framework is organized based on the main elements of the mathematical model. The model consists of (1) output variables Y, (2) input variables X, (3) input parameters θ , and (4) a mathematical equation f. This approach focuses on how to construct, verify/validate, calibrate, and extend operational models in building operation stages using available modeling sources. This framework is established based on the in-situ modeling methodology proposed in [18]. Fig. 4 illustrates the VIM framework in terms of five key aspects. 4.1 Modeling environments Modeling environments are composed of (1) observed, (2) unobserved, and (3) limited environments, depending on whether the model inputs and outputs are observed by sensors during the VIM process for building operations. In real building O&M, sensors for model inputs and outputs can be absent or faulty. In an observed environment, a model output is observed by a sensor in the VIM process, and the operational data for the model output is available within the VIM. On the other hand, the unobserved environment lacks measurement data for the model output because it is unobserved by a sensor. Limited environments refer to cases in which some input sensors are insufficient to construct the target model accurately. The VIM framework is established to overcome the challenges of unobserved and limited environments in in-situ modeling for building operations. 4.2 Model types A virtual building has three types of models: behavioral, correctional, and distance models. Behavioral models calculate physical variables in building operations, correctional models provide correctional variables to compensate for target model errors, and distance models are defined by residual forms (e.g., the sum of squared errors) between behavioral model outputs and their observations for a certain period of operation. Behavioral models are classified into prediction and benchmark models, as shown in Fig. 5 , depending on their purposes. Prediction models calculate physical variables that are not observed by physical sensors. The benchmark models provide reference values for the physical variables observed by sensors during operation. Considering their definitions, the prediction and benchmark models are regarded as unobserved and observed models, respectively. Moreover, if the sensors used to observe the benchmark model outputs are deemed faulty, the benchmark models can be incorporated into the prediction models. Correctional models are constructed to correct operational model errors, particularly biases. Although physics-based models can be calibrated by correctly updating unknown model parameters, a correctional model can be assigned to calibrate and manage the models in the context of VIM. Correctional models can be defined using various formulations including constants [25], polynomial equations with multiple parameters and inputs [25], and neutral networks [47]. Distance models are employed for model verification and validation, as expressed in Eqs. (1) and (2). If the distance exceeds its threshold, the distance model can be used as an objective function in correction modeling process, as shown in Eq. (3). Correction modeling is conducted using a parameter estimation process to identify unknown parameters within a behavioral model and/or the corrective parameters of the supplementary correctional model. This identification occurs while minimizing the distance model.

The types of data are nonintrusive, intrusive, calculated, simulated, and open data. Nonintrusive data are the operational data obtained by sensor networks in building automation and management systems. The data represent real and typical building operations, which depend on the installed sensors. Intrusive data are data obtained from additional measurements in the field through intrusive efforts (such as the use of portable instruments) [48]. These data are usually limited and expensive for the VIM process, but special for intended operation periods. For the data interface within BIM and DT environments, unlike nonintrusive data measured by BMS or BAS, intrusive measurements require separate data integration and database management during the VIM process. Calculated data are data obtained from the virtual models implemented for operations. If the virtual models operate in real time, the data can be regarded as virtual sensor data. Simulated data can be obtained using conventional building simulations especially for design stages. Open data are data that are shared and available from other source buildings, experiments, and projects (e.g., Chicago open data projects [49]). Simulation and open datasets can be extensive in volume but often come with significant uncertainty when describing the operational phases for a target building. This information includes the building design information, device specifications, and operation and control conditions. These data can be used for white-box modeling, defining model parameters, and designing model coverage. Prebuilt models are available from experiments, source buildings, and historical models related to the target buildings. These models need on-site fine-tuning to accurately represent the physical behavior of the target building. 4.4 In-situ modeling approaches In-situ modeling approaches are classified into two types depending on the types of data used for a target model output Y: nonintrusive and intrusive modeling. First, nonintrusive modeling is a modeling approach using the nonintrusive data obtained from BMS or BAS without intrusive efforts. Second, intrusive modeling is a modeling approach that uses the intrusive data for the unobserved model output. These two approaches adopt the conventional modeling approaches including white-box, black-box, and gray-box approaches. The white-box approach is based on the physics of the target and its inputs, allowing the nonintrusive construction of a prediction model without model output data. The black-box approach uses data-driven modeling methods (e.g., machine learning). The gray-box approach combines physics with data-driven estimation processes to determine the unknown parameters of physical models. Data-driven methods, including black-box and gray-box approaches, require operational data for the model output and inputs. Therefore, data-driven modeling methods are available for benchmark modeling with the nonintrusive data provided within the observed modeling environment. However, it is necessary to obtain intrusive data for the model output to enable data-driven prediction modeling. 4.4.1 Behavioral modeling Benchmark models can be developed using data-driven approaches because they have model observations (Y). Data-driven modeling considers operational uncertainties during training process. If a prebuilt model is available for the benchmark model, gray-box modeling including the base model (white-box or prebuilt model), can be used to reduce the required number of datasets for a certain model accuracy, compared to black-box modeling without using the prebuilt model [22]. Prebuilt models can be established using simulated and open datasets, or previous models used in past target building operations. On the other hand, prediction models are impossible to construct using data-driven approaches because of the absence of model output data. Thus, white-box modeling is appropriate for prediction models; however, model verification is challenging without model observations. If intrusive data are available, prediction models can be constructed by intrusive-data-driven modeling, even if the quantity of intrusive data is less than that of the nonintrusive data. Gray-box modeling with white-box or prebuilt models can be beneficial with limited intrusive data. 4.4.2 Distance modeling Distance models can only be defined for benchmark models with observations of normal operations, as shown in Fig. 6a and Eq. (2). With intrusive data, distance modeling can be extended to prediction models corresponding to the intrusive data, as shown in Fig. 6b and Eq. (2). By using distance models with their thresholds defined, as in Eqs. (4) and (5), the target behavioral models can be directly verified or validated for specific modeling periods or different operations. If these distance models exceed the set thresholds, the correction models are assigned to the behavioral models to reduce the distance below the thresholds. (4) h D = Y o − Y ^ m B or M − Y ^ m P (5) Y ^ m → Y v , if h D ≤ ε 4.4.3 Correctional modeling Correction modeling is achieved by solving the distance model minimization problem, as shown in Fig. 6c and Fig. 6d, where the correctional parameters predefined in a correction model are determined to minimize the distance model. Thus, nonintrusive correctional modeling is basically employed to construct correctional models only for the benchmark models. When performing intrusive measurements for prediction models, it is possible to conduct correction modeling of these prediction models for intrusive periods. In this context, the research question is how to obtain informative intrusive data that maximize modeling performance for a given amount of data obtained through intrusive measurements [24]. 4.5 Model fusion techniques In-situ model fusion refers to a set of techniques aimed at enabling (1) the construction of new or higher-level models, (2) the improvement of model reliability, and (3) their subsequent verification/validation and calibration for reliable models [20] under an unobserved and/or limited modeling environment. These techniques involve the integration of individual prediction and benchmark models to overcome insufficient and harsh modeling environments for building operations. Model fusion involves two main techniques: model coupling and model assembly. 4.5.1 Model coupling between prediction and benchmark for correctional modeling A model coupling technique is employed to establish a connection between the output of a prediction model and one of the inputs in a benchmark model. This results in the establishment of a non-intrusively extended correctional modeling environment, including unobserved prediction models. This technique is designed to indirectly validate and correct unobserved prediction models without requiring intrusive measurements of the model outputs for validation and correction. Essentially, it operates based on the hypothesis that the accuracy of the target prediction model output can be considered reliable if the reference benchmark model accuracy meets a specified threshold defined by the coupled structure. Moreover, it is assumed that the remaining input variables and the benchmark model are sufficiently accurate for indirect verification and correction modeling. In cases in which the reference benchmark model is found to be unacceptable, the model-coupled estimation model is solved until the benchmark residuals fall below the threshold in order to define the correction model of the target prediction model. The motivation behind this technique is to make it possible to perform correction modeling of prediction models, which would otherwise be impossible through nonintrusive modeling. Finally, based on the modeling coupling technique, the interactions between different model types can be determined, as shown in Fig. 7a and Fig. 7b. The closed model loop that encompasses all model types (prediction-benchmark-distance-correction) is referred to as PBDC. In the PBDC loop, the benchmark model can be connected to multiple prediction models for correctional modeling. In addition, the benchmark model can be included in the correctional modeling process for both the prediction and benchmark models. 4.5.2 Model assembly for extended and reliable prediction and benchmark models The model assembly defines a reliable model output as one of the model inputs to overcome limited modeling environments (e.g., input sensor absence, faults, and inaccuracy) in building operations, and is aimed at extending and maintaining the model environment of virtual buildings in operations. Additional models constructed from VIM can be employed as inputs for potential and existing models using the model assembly technique. Model assembly has two sub-techniques according to the target model type (prediction or benchmark). The first assembly technique, shown in Fig. 7c, is designed to link the verified output of the base model (prediction or benchmark) with one of the inputs in the target prediction model, which would otherwise be impossible to construct because of the inaccuracy or absence of inputs. This technique aims to expand the scope of prediction models, thereby contributing to the creation of a comprehensive virtual building model within the constraints of limited physical sensing capabilities. After the model is assembled using this technique, it can be verified or corrected using the model coupling technique. The second assembly technique seeks to link the reliable output of the base model to one of the inputs of the target benchmark model, as shown in Fig. 7d. This approach is used to enhance and expand the benchmark model environment when the original benchmark model lacks reliability or completeness owing to inadequate, missing, or faulty input variables. The enhanced or extended benchmark model environment resulting from this model assembly creates a more dependable foundation for model coupling, particularly for the unvalidated prediction models introduced in the initial model assembly. Finally, Fig. 8 shows an example of combined model-fusion techniques. Multiple prediction models can be connected to the benchmark model through model assembly 1 for simultaneous correctional modeling. Model assembly 2 can improve the benchmark modeling for a better model coupling effect. 5 Methodology This section describes the VIM decision methodology for both benchmark and prediction models. This methodology was developed based on the five aspects of the VIM framework detailed in Section 4. Fig. 9 shows the VIM methodology used for benchmark modeling. Given that benchmark modeling relies on observed modeling environments according to the benchmark model definition, data-driven modeling approaches (either black-box or gray-box) are considered. If a prebuilt model is available for a target benchmark model, gray-box modeling can be more suitable to harness the model asset, especially when training data are limited (e.g., during initial operations after construction). Once a modeling approach is determined, it is assessed whether the modeling operates within a limited modeling environment, typically owing to the absence, malfunction, or inaccuracy of sensors. If a limited environment is identified, a model assembly technique is employed to supplement critical input, provided that a model built from the previous VIM process is available. The input model can be determined using correlation analysis [50,51] between the input model output (symbol) and the target model observation (symbol). Subsequently, a direct distance model for the target benchmark model is formulated using the model output observation. If the distance value is lower than the defined threshold, the benchmark is either verified for the modeling period or validated for the model operation periods. However, if the benchmark model cannot be considered reliable for constructing the target physical behavior, correction modeling is executed to establish a correction model aiming to enhance the accuracy of the target benchmark model. Fig. 10 shows the VIM methodology used for prediction modeling. Because prediction modeling is initially conducted under an unobserved modeling environment, exploring available modeling sources is more intricate compared to the benchmark modeling process. White-box modeling is necessary in cases where sources such as simulated, calculated, and intrusive data and prebuilt models are unavailable. If only a prebuilt model is accessible, it can be reused for prediction modeling. Data-driven modeling is feasible in other scenarios where intrusive data can be obtained. As mentioned with regard to benchmark modeling, because intrusive data are typically limited in volume, gray-box modeling is strongly recommended when a prebuilt model is also accessible. Finally, in cases in which simulated or calculated datasets are available, data-driven modeling is also an option. If intrusive data are unavailable for the model output, black-box modeling can be used to obtain surrogate models. Careful attention must be paid to the verification and correction of these surrogate models because the simulated datasets contain uncertainties. If intrusive data are available, the surrogate model can be corrected using a gray-box modeling approach. After deciding on the modeling approach, it is crucial to determine whether the modeling is conducted within a limited environment. If a limited environment is identified, a model assembly technique is applied to supplement the critical input, assuming that a model constructed using the previous VIM process is available. Subsequently, distance modeling is carried out to verify and correct the target prediction model. If intrusive data are available, a direct distance model is constructed using this data. If intrusive data are not available, indirect distance modeling is performed using a model coupling technique. If the distance model value is lower than the threshold, the target prediction model is either verified for the modeling period or validated for the model operation periods. However, if the model value exceeds the threshold, correctional modeling is initiated. During the correctional modeling process, if the benchmark model used for model coupling operates within a limited modeling environment, model assembly 2 is conducted using the available input model built from the previous VIM. 6 Case study 6.1 Building systems A heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) system was selected as the target building system to implement the concept and approach of VIM. A digital twin environment was developed for a living laboratory, as shown in Fig. 11 . A BIM model of the HVAC system was constructed using the BIM software Revit [52], and the BIM-based DT environment was established using the Revit Dynamo interface. Fig. 11 shows the system diagram for the physical entities of the selected HVAC system. In this study, as shown in Fig. 12 , the Brick schema [53] was used to describe the semantic relationships between the building, HVAC system, and BAS data for VIM. 6.2 VIM description Fig. 13 represents the workflow of VIM in this case study for a target HVAC system using the Dynamo interface. Two main virtual models were constructed using the proposed VIM in the Dynamo environment. A first virtual prediction model for the chilled water return temperature was constructed via the PBDC loop of VIM using the Dynamo environment. Then, a second virtual benchmark model for the chilled water flow rate was modeled using the virtual prediction model within the model fusion technique of model assembly 2 in VIM; this modeling for the virtual benchmark model will be explained in the context of the FDD application in Section 6.3. The metadata of these virtual models was finally updated into the BIM model. This process is depicted in Fig. 13b within the Dynamo workspace. In the Dynamo workspace, data corresponding to the names of objects stored in the BIM was used to model the first virtual prediction model. Subsequently, this data and the first virtual prediction model were used to model the second virtual benchmark model. During this virtual modeling process, Python scripts provided by Dynamo were utilized. Additionally, the process included mapping the VIM results and metadata of each model to the BIM. Fig. 14 shows the pseudo-code for this VIM process for the two virtual models within the BIM-based DT environment using the Dynamo interface. 6.2.1 Prediction modeling The chilled water return temperature was selected as the target variable to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed VIM modeling method via the PBDC loop. The chilled water supply temperature is regulated using a heat pump to ensure that the supply air temperature follows its setting point. After heating, the heated chilled return water is collected through the header and subsequently cooled again in the heat pump. The heat generated during this process is transferred to the cooling tower and discarded. In this case, the target variable is considered unobservable. Therefore, a white-box modeling approach was inevitably implemented to model the chilled water return temperatures. The prediction model for the chilled water return temperatures was obtained by using Eqs. (6) to (9). (6) Q CHW P = Q CW − W HP (7) Q CHW P = C p m C HW T CHWR − T CHWS (8) Q CW = C p m CW T CWR − T CWS (9) T CHWR P = Q CW − W HP C p m CHW + T CHWS 6.2.2 Benchmark modeling A supply air temperature benchmark model was developed to apply the model-coupling technique for model calibration. The output value of the chilled water return temperature prediction model was utilized as a key input variable for the benchmark model. A multi-layer perceptron (MLP) [54] was selected to develop the benchmark model for predicting the supply air temperature. The internal structure of the multilayer perceptron model is described in Table 1 . 6.2.3 Distance modeling Fig. 15 illustrates the residual of the distance model results. As denoted in Eqs. (10) and (11), the distance model refers to the residual between the output value of the benchmark model and the corresponding measured sensor value. As shown in Fig. 15, the output value of the distance model has a biased error owing to the uncertainty of the benchmark model, which utilizes the output variable of the prediction model as a key input variable. This implies that the performance of the model can be improved by minimizing the distance using the model coupling technique.

The calibration process involved utilizing the benchmark model developed in Section 6.2.2 and the distance model outlined in Section 6.2.3. The linear correction functions g C x C C were designed for the target variables using Eq. (12). Two correction parameters were determined using the posterior distribution (Eq. (13)) induced from Bayesian inference based on the prior probability ( π C ), likelihood function (Eq. (14)), and normalization constant P Y . To avoid the need for integral calculations, the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) [55] method and Metropolis\u2013Hastings algorithm [56] were adopted to calculate the normalization constant.

In Case 1, MLP modeling was performed using the given sensor data; in Case 2, using the sensor data and the initial prediction model outputs for chilled water supply temperatures (before PBDC); and in Case 3, using the sensor data and the virtual prediction model outputs for chilled water supply temperatures (after PBDC). In fact, the benchmark model for Case 3 was considered the second virtual benchmark model in Section 6.2. The MLP modeling settings for each case are shown in Table 2 . Based on the two virtual models constructed from the PBDC and model assembly 2 proposed in VIM, an FDD was developed, as shown in Fig. 16 , using the DT environment in the Dynamo interface. In the Dynamo workspace, the process was illustrated using the prebuilt virtual chilled water return temperature prediction model and the virtual chilled water flow benchmark model, both developed through the VIM process. The FDD algorithm was then executed using these models with Python scripts provided by Dynamo, and the resulting FDD outputs were mapped to the BIM. The developed FDD aims to detect abnormalities occurring in the physical sensor of chilled water flow rates and determine the operational errors. For the three case studies, the FDD algorithm was defined as in Eqs. (15) and (16) to detect sensor errors when the residuals between the sensor measurements and benchmark outputs (modeled in each case) for chilled water flow rates exceed 0.2 CMH for more than 10 min. (15) h D = m CHW − m ̂ CHW B (16) m CHW → m CHW , f , if h D > 0.2 CMH over 10 minutes The sensor errors for the chilled water flow rate sensor were arbitrarily given in the DT environment, including a bias error and a random error, starting at 10:03 AM on August 31, 2022. The FDD performance assessment for the three cases was conducted for this day. The magnitude of the given sensor error is shown in Table 3 . 7 Results 7.1 VIM results Fig. 17 shows the modeling results of the initial prediction model for chilled water return temperatures before the PBDC loop. The accuracy of the prediction model obtained an RMSE of 0.60 ° C during the validation period of August 1, 2022 - August 31, 2022. This result contributes to the extension of the digital twin by modeling the unobserved target variable. However, even though the feasibility of the physics-based prediction model was verified, a biased model error was detected owing to inherent operational uncertainty. This uncertainty implies the necessity of VIM to increase the accuracy of the prediction model. Meanwhile, Fig. 17 also shows the results of the first virtual prediction model from the PBDC loop with its correction model. For the non-intrusive calibration that followed the PBDC loop, the accuracy of the initial physics-based prediction model improved, reducing the RMSE from 0.60 ° C to 0.24 ° C . This comparison between the initial prediction model and the virtual prediction model demonstrates the effectiveness of the VIM method in providing an accurate and extended virtual model environment in the context of DT and BIM. Fig. 18 represents the results of the second virtual model for chilled water flow rates used to create the reference model for the FDD algorithm. Fig. 18a shows the results of Case 1, where the initial or virtual model for chilled water return temperatures was not utilized in the benchmark modeling process. Fig. 18b shows the results of Case 2, where the physics-based initial prediction model for chilled water return temperatures was used. Finally, Fig. 18c illustrates Case 3, where the first virtual model using the PBDC loop was employed via the model fusion technique of model assembly 2. For Case 1, the accuracy of the benchmark model for chilled water flow rates was 3.59 % MAPE, 0.93 % for Case 2, and 0.87 % for Case 3. This result implies that using the prediction model outputs improves benchmark modeling accuracy compared to not using them. Additionally, it is confirmed that the model assembly technique performs better when the PBDC-driven virtual model is employed. Table 4 shows the metadata for the two virtual models, including the built date, model accuracy, virtual model type, modeling period, and metadata file. These metadata serve as examples of properties for the creation and continuous management of virtual models. In this study, as shown in Fig. 19 , the metadata of these virtual models were automatically updated to the Revit model through Dynamo inference, demonstrating the continuous integration of the digital twin and BIM environments. 7.2 FDD performance Fig. 20a to 20c sequentially illustrate the time series results for Case 1: an FDD model not utilizing any models for chilled water return temperature, Case 2: an FDD model using the initial prediction model, and Case 3: an FDD model using the virtual prediction model. In Case 1, the error was detected 89 min after its occurrence, in Case 2, 30 min after, and in Case 3, only 10 min after the error occurrence. Additionally, as shown in Table 5 , the model performance obtained from the confusion matrices was superior in the order of Case 3, Case 2, and Case 1. The VIM-assisted FDD in Case 3 had an early detection feature, accurately estimating the sensor error characteristics in terms of bias and random errors according to the virtual model environment. The bias and random errors were determined by an average magnitude of 0.303 CMH and a standard deviation of 0.05, respectively. These results were attributed to the performance differences of the reference model for chilled water flow rates used to develop the FDD algorithm. It can be seen that the performance of the reference model used in each case depended on the existence of the prediction model for chilled water return temperature and its accuracy. Moreover, similar to the generated virtual models, the FDD information was converted into metadata form as listed in Table 6 , and this metadata was recorded, as shown in Fig. 19b, for the management of DT-enabled O&M application in the BIM model using the Dynamo environment. 8 Discussion 8.1 Accurate and extensive virtual models using VIM Under the limited sensing environment in building operations, physics-based prediction modeling with BIM can provide dynamic behavioral models for the physical variables unobserved by sensors in DT-enabled building operations. However, these physical models can have considerable errors due to operational uncertainties with sensors, equipment, and systems. According to the case study on chilled water return temperatures, the initial prediction model showed a quite large RMSE of 0.60 °C. This indicates that advanced modeling methods are imperatively needed, especially for unobserved behaviors in the context of DT-enabled building operations. In this situation, the concept of VIM proposed in this study demonstrated how the initial physics-based prediction model is enhanced in-situ for building operations via the PBDC loop with model coupling. Importantly, this VIM process was nonintrusive in-situ modeling where intrusive measurements for a target behavior (or ground truth) were not used for its prediction modeling. This is because the VIM utilizes available data, models, and their relationships within the PBDC loop to improve the unobserved prediction models, rather than relying on the direct ground truth for the model output. This VIM feature can contribute to enhancing and extending the virtual model environment for DT operations. For example, the second virtual benchmark model for chilled water flow rates was not accurate due to the absence of a key input sensor and its data, but it was significantly improved using the first virtual prediction model for chilled water return temperatures within the model fusion technique of model assembly 2. Finally, VIM is a modeling method that utilizes model fusion techniques with available data and models in the DT and BIM environments. It aims to construct more accurate and extensive virtual models that describe physical and dynamic behaviors for building operations, moving towards an original, ideal, and full digital twin environment. 8.2 VIM-assisted O&M applications The FDD application of this study indicates the need for an extended and accurate virtual model environment through VIM to implement advanced O&M applications in the DT. In a limited sensing environment, sensor data alone, without the support of virtual models that describe physical behaviors, makes it difficult to achieve good FDD performance (as shown in Case 1 of FDD). Through VIM-driven virtual models, advanced FDD was implemented with early detection and diagnostic estimation of the error characteristics and magnitudes of the target sensors. Beyond the FDD developed in this study, accurate virtual models are crucial for providing advanced and intelligent applications for building O&M and more informative and reliable data, information, knowledge, and decision-making for ideal building operations. Furthermore, considering the uncertainties and continuous changes during the building's operational phase, it is important to clearly distinguish between application algorithms and virtual models, rather than implementing mathematical models describing physical behaviors within the application algorithms. Establishing a system for continuously calibrating and managing virtual models is essential. 8.3 VIM: A bridge between BIM and DT Based on building metadata schemas such as IFC and Brick schema, VIM can be conducted effectively, continuously, and automatically using BIM information in a DT environment (as shown in this study with the Dynamo interface). In addition, the metadata for virtual models constructed from VIM can be updated into the BIM model, which contributes to managing the virtual models, implementing the next VIM process, and enhancing the connection between the BIM and DT models. Thus, VIM provides more efficient and accurate virtual models to the DT through BIM while continuously including and managing virtual model information during the building's operational phase in the BIM environment. This implies that, from the perspective of DT-enabled building operations and management, virtual models should be recognized as critical assets of the building. This perspective enables efficient operation and management of both BIM and DT, especially for building operations and maintenance. Finally, the above discussions have been summarized in Table 7 , distinguishing between the phases before and after the introduction of VIM from the perspectives of both BIM and DT. 8.4 Limitations and future studies In this study, VIM was limited to the two physical behaviors in the target HVAC system and the sensor FDD. The effectiveness of VIM was demonstrated under limited modeling scenarios. Therefore, it is necessary to expand the application and demonstration of the VIM methodology to various physical behaviors within various systems and buildings. Furthermore, research can be conducted on the use of virtual models generated by VIM in various DT applications beyond the FDD implemented in this study. Human behaviors and their interactions with virtual models are important for advanced DT applications in future studies. To utilize VIM and the resulting virtual models effectively in BIM and DT environments, it is necessary to establish a metadata schema standard for virtual models and ensure interoperability with existing building metadata schemas (e.g., IFC). Additionally, an industry-wide process for the VIM procedure is required, and further research should focus on developing an autonomous VIM process rather than a manual one. Nevertheless, due to the increasing uncertainties of the virtual models within the existing PBDC loop over long-term building operations, it is important to obtain the ground truth, even for short periods, through the commissioning or O&M stages to ensure and verify the continuous accuracy of VIM. Finally, establishing more accurate and extensive virtual models with their metadata schema in the industry can contribute to enabling advanced building simulation during design stages within the virtual model-assisted holistic DT environment. 9 Conclusion Virtual building models are essential for advanced building operations and maintenance in the context of DT and BIM. It is crucial to establish a concept and methods for constructing, calibrating, and managing these virtual models. As shown in the case study, the virtual model constructed using white-box modeling contains inherent uncertainty. Mitigating uncertainty using real field data is important for developing virtual building models. Therefore, this paper proposes the concept and framework of VIM to construct accurate and comprehensive virtual building models. This concept is intended to bridge the gaps between DT and BIM for advanced O&M. The concept of the PBDC loop was introduced based on the VIM framework. The PBDC loop refers to a series of processes that involve the modeling, validation/verification, and calibrating of target variables depending on the modeling condition or environment with real field operational data. The feasibility of the proposed methodology was demonstrated by developing a virtual model for chilled water return temperature. Because the physical chilled water return temperature was assumed to be unobservable, the model was developed using a deployed sensing network without a chilled water return temperature sensor, employing the proposed modeling methodology. The virtual prediction model accuracy for the chilled water return temperature was assessed, yielding a very low RMSE of 0.24 °C. Subsequently, the virtual model-assisted FDD provided early detection and diagnostic estimation features compared to the FDD without the virtual model. Furthermore, the proposed VIM concept can be seamlessly integrated with both BIM and the metadata schema for VBM. From the viewpoint of BIM, operational information management becomes feasible through the utilization of the constructed virtual building model and the metadata schema. On the other hand, from the viewpoint of DT, an accurate virtual building model can be developed by leveraging design and construction data accumulated in BIM. This integration is anticipated to foster a synergistic connection between BIM and DT.

        "dc:description": "A virtual model that mathematically represents operational behaviors is essential for implementing the concepts of digital twins (DTs) and building information modeling (BIM) to achieve intelligent, optimal building operations. However, current research lacks an approach to reliably construct virtual models. This paper introduces a concept named virtual in-situ modeling (VIM), designed to comprehensively represent building behaviors. The VIM framework is based on five key aspects: modeling environments, model types, modeling sources, modeling approaches, and model fusion techniques. VIM bridges BIM and DT, enabling virtual modeling during the operational phase and enhancing both BIM-based DT and DT-enhanced BIM. Case studies conducted using real building operations demonstrate the effectiveness of VIM, achieving a highly accuracy (RMSE of 0.24 °C). Additionally, the VIM-assisted fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) provided early detection and diagnostic estimation, outperforming FDD without the virtual model. This paper highlights the potential of VIM for advanced building operations and maintenance.",
