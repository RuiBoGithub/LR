The multi-zone variable air volume (VAV) air-conditioning system is a complex thermal system with large delay and nonlinearity. Due to the complex environment of multi-zone buildings and the complicated operation process of the VAV air-conditioning system, there are many difficulties in the room temperature control. This paper firstly establishes a multi-zone building model for room temperature using resistance\u2013capacitance method. This investigation simulates and measures the dynamic response of room temperature in a three-floor building without/with air-conditioning for validation. Then a multi-zone VAV air-conditioning system room temperature predictive control model based on radial basis function (RBF) neural network (NN) is proposed. This study sets up a multi-zone VAV air-conditioning system experimental platform in the three rooms on the first floor of the building and implements the predictive control model based on the RBF neural network. The experimental results show that the predictive control model based on RBF NN is able to meet room temperature requirements. It also has strong anti-interference performance and ensures stable static pressure of the main air supply duct. The multi-zone building model can accurately simulate the temperature changes of each room when the air supply volume varies.

In terms of ventilation rates, the traditional air-conditioning system supplies constant air volume (CAV) and chilled water in disregard of the changes in heating/cooling load, which inevitably leads to waste of energy. In order to obtain higher energy-efficiency and a better indoor climate, variable air volume (VAV) air-conditioning and demand control ventilation (DCV) is widely used in offices and commercial buildings. VAV and DCV systems are able to adjust the ventilation and air conditioning in response to varying activity levels [1]. Comparing with the CAV system, the VAV/DCV systems has more precise temperature control, reduced compressor wear, lower energy consumption by system fans, less fan noise, and additional passive dehumidification [2,3]. VAV air-conditioning system uses the most basic demand control and allows the air flow to be adjusted in response to factors such as temperature or air quality. DCV system uses advanced demand control and adjusts the air flow and temperature in response to demand and occupancy status in rooms. A VAV air-conditioning system is not as advanced as a DCV system, but it generally has lower investment cost and would be perfectly adequate for projects with less advanced demand scenario or construction sites with little intermittent change in the flow of people. Room temperature control is the core and foundation of the VAV system. Accurate room temperature control can improve the performance of the VAV air-conditioning system, so the requirements for control accuracy are getting higher and higher. The room temperature depends on the building envelope, indoor heat source, outdoor environment, and the operation of the VAV terminal. Therefore, a multi-zone building mathematical model that can predict the dynamic response of room temperature need to be established to accurately control the room temperature of the multi-zone VAV air-conditioning system. In the study of multi-zone building models, some researchers use resistance\u2013capacitance (RC) network methods to simplify the building envelope model and establish a multi-zone mathematical model to simulate room temperature changes under different working conditions [4\u20136]. Jin et al., [7] used the heat capacity and thermal resistance network method to divide the wall and other building envelope into one-layer structure and established a multi-zone mathematical model of air-conditioning in a room with partition walls. Although the model can accurately calculate the energy consumption of the room and ensure indoor comfort, it does not consider the coupling of heat transfer between floors and indoor air flow in multi-zone buildings, which causes some deviation in simulating the dynamic response of room temperature. It is necessary to establish a more accurate multi-zone building mathematical model to reduce the dynamic response deviation of room temperature in the simulation process. To realize better control of the indoor temperature of a multi-zone VAV air-conditioning system, not only an accurate multi-zone building model is required, but also an advanced algorithm to optimize the control method of the terminal temperature of the multi-zone VAV. The traditional VAV air-conditioning system uses the proportional integral (PI) algorithm to control the damper, but it cannot overcome the control system oscillations caused by sudden indoor cooling/heating loads in practical applications [8,9]. Moreover, in the indoor temperature control process, due to the heat storage of the building envelope and the instantaneous cooling/heating load variations, the room temperature response of the VAV air-conditioning system has a significant lag [10\u201312]. To overcome the lag in controls, Bai et. al [15] proposed an adaptive Smith predictor to provide lag compensation to the controller, but this method requires an accurate mathematical model of the controlled object. Xu et al., [16] applied the generalized predictive control to the room temperature output of the air-conditioning system. But due to the large amount of calculation in the application process, the slow response resulted in poor control. Zhang et al., [17] applied fuzzy control to the terminal damper control of the VAV air-conditioning system. The experimental results showed that the control method could reduce the energy consumption of the system when the heating/cooling loads in each zone were the same. When there was a big difference of zone temperature, this control method had obvious shortcomings. In multi-zone buildings, the complexity of the structure and environment in each area increases the difficulty of achieving accurate control of the indoor temperature [13,14]. Therefore, there is an urgent need to apply excellent control algorithms to the terminal room temperature control of multi-zone VAV air-conditioning and improve the indoor thermal environment of multi-zone buildings. With the rapid development of intelligent algorithms, neural networks (NN) and model prediction control algorithms have been applied to the room temperature control of VAV air-conditioning systems. Lu et al., [18] developed a prediction model by NN and genetic algorithm with nonlinear autoregressive model for indoor temperature and humidity of central air-conditioning. Kusiak et al., [19] combined the particle swarm algorithm and dynamic NN to optimize a VAV terminal, the experimental results show that the multi-objective optimization of the particle swarm algorithm could reduce the energy consumption of the air conditioning system and ensure the indoor temperature is within an acceptable range. Huang et al., [20] proposed a feed-forward NN model-based identification method to model multi-zone buildings. The model could accurately predict the change of indoor temperature after training with a large amount of data and then developed the best control strategy. Li et al., [21] applied the Elman NN to the predictive control model of the VAV air-conditioning system. Li et al., [22] presented the prediction methods for indoor temperature lag response characteristic based on time-delay NN (TDNN) and Elman NN. The results show that the Elman NN is a good prediction method for indoor temperature with small storage space and high prediction accuracy. Huang et al., [23] applied the model prediction control algorithm to the flow control device of the VAV air-conditioning system. The experimental results show that the model prediction control algorithm has good transient response (rise time, settling time and overshoot percentage) in the control. However, in the above-mentioned research, the prediction of indoor temperature is achieved through historical data and the nonlinear mapping capabilities of NNs. It is impossible to adjust the indoor temperature in real time. Although the model prediction control algorithm can control the air-conditioning terminal device, it relies too much on accurate mathematical models and is difficult to implement. In recent years, radial basis function (RBF) NN have been widely used in aerospace, medical, energy and other fields. RBF NN combined with predictive control theory has strong predictive control performance and nonlinear mapping capabilities [24\u201327], universal approximation and uniqueness of the best approximation property [28]. Ye et al., [29] applied the residual-corrected RBF NN to predict the air conditioning load and obtained high prediction accuracy. Sina et al., [30] used fuzzy controller and RBF NN to model and evaluate HVAC system, and the results show that RBF network has better performance than fuzzy model. Zheng et al., [31] combined proportional integral derivative (PID) control algorithm with fuzzy algorithm and RBF to establish a mathematical model of temperature control system in air conditioning room. The results show that the algorithm has short convergence time, strong anti-interference ability and superior control effect. VAV system is a typical time-delay system, which can adjust the air volume into the room according to the variation of indoor heating/cooling load. Based on the response characteristics of time-delay systems and the principle of periodic predictive control, this research proposes a mathematical model for predictive control of the room temperature by multi-zone VAV air-conditioning systems. The model is based on the multi-zone building mathematical model constructed by RC network two-node wall structure method. The developed models are validated by experimental measurements in a real building. 2 The multi-zone building mathematical model 2.1 Multi-zone building model There are many factors that affect the change of room temperature, especially outdoor environmental factors, which makes it difficult to establish a model that can simulate the dynamic changes of the room temperature in real time. In response to this problem, this research proposes a RC network two-node wall structure method to describe and analyze the heat conduction process of the building envelope. This method can transform the complex heat transfer process of the building envelope into a simple mathematical problem and provide a new idea to establish a mathematical model of the room temperature dynamic response. 2.1.1 Room model For the sake of analysis, a single room model is established firstly as shown in Fig. 1 . The room has six sides, including an exterior wall with a window, two adjacent interior walls, an inner wall with a door, floor, and ceiling. The room is 5.9 m long, 3.9 m wide, and 3.3 m high. The room volume is about 76 m3. The area of the window is 2 m2. As shown in Fig. 2 , the room is separated into three typical zones, including the air-supply zone, the work zone, and air-return zone. Air in each zone is assumed to be fully mixed and described by one state. Considering that the heat storage of air is smaller than that of objects such as building envelope, and the radiative heat transfer process between them is complex, so the radiative heat transfer between indoor walls and objects is ignored. To simplify the model, the energy transferred from solar radiation to the inner and outer surfaces of the wall and the energy transferred from the indoor heat source to the inner surface of the wall through radiation are set to constant values. The convective heat transfer coefficients between the walls or the heat sources and the adjacent air are considered to be constant during the simulation. 2.1.2 Energy and humidity balance equations of the single-room This study uses the RC network method to describe the heat transfer through the building envelope. The RC network method can accurately describe the temperature change of the building envelope. The wall, ceiling, and floor of a room are divided into two layers as shown in Fig. 3 . The heat capacity and resistance of each layer of walls, ceiling and floor are concentrated on the central node and the corresponding nodes of the indoor and outdoor contact surfaces. Among them, Tout is the outdoor temperature, Tin is the indoor temperature, Twa1 is the temperature of the first node of the wall, Twa2 is the temperature of the second node of the wall, Twa,out is the surface node temperature of the external wall, Twa,in is the internal wall surface node temperature, the box is the thermal resistance and heat capacity of the air or wall, and the symbol \u201c Cwa \u201d is the heat capacity of the wall. The process of the room temperature change is affected by many factors. To establish a simple and universal multi-zone building mathematical model, the following assumptions must be made: (1) The air properties are assumed to be uniform in each zone. (2) The envelop enclosure wall is divided into two layers and the heat transfer is one-dimensional. (3) The transmission of indoor humidity through the building envelope is not considered. In order to analyze the heat transfer through building envelope, the wall and floor shown in Fig. 1 is divided into two layers using the RC network method. Then the energy changes of the four nodes of the wall are analyzed using the energy balance theory and the energy balance equations are established. The thickness between the outer surface of the wall and the second node of the wall is 1/4 of the thickness of the wall, and the thickness between the two nodes of the wall is 1/2 of the thickness of the wall. The thickness between the surfaces is 1/4 of the wall thickness. For single node of room wall, the equation is shown as follows: The e n e r g y c h a n g e a t a sin g l e n o d e = I n c o min g e n e r g y i n u n i t t i m e - O u t g o i n g e n e r g y i n u n i t t i m e Therefore, the energy balance equation of the outer surface of the wall, the second node of the wall, the first node of the wall and the inner surface of the wall can be obtained by Eq. (1), as follows: (2) λ wa 1 4 δ wa A wa ( T w a 2 - T wa , o u t ) + A wa K wa , o u t ( T out - T wa , o u t ) + Q sunfu = 0 (3) 1 2 ρ wa δ wa A wa C wa d T w a 2 dt = λ wa 1 2 δ wa A wa ( T w a 1 - T w a 2 ) + λ wa 1 4 δ wa A wa ( T wa , o u t - T w a 2 ) (4) 1 2 ρ wa δ wa A wa C wa d T w a 1 dt = λ wa 1 4 δ wa A wa ( T wa , i n - T w a 1 ) + λ wa 1 2 δ wa A wa ( T w a 2 - T w a 1 ) (5) λ wa 1 4 δ wa A wa ( T w a 1 - T wa , i n ) + A wa K wa , i n ( T inr - T wa , i n ) + Q sunen + Q inner = 0 where Awa is the wall area; λwa is the thermal conductivity of the wall; ẟwa is wall thickness; Kwa,out is the heat transfer coefficient of the outer wall and outdoor air; Kwa,in is the heat transfer coefficient of the inner wall and indoor air; Tout is the outdoor temperature; Twa,out is the temperature of the outer wall surface; Twa1 is the temperature of the first node in the wall; Twa2 is the temperature of the second node in the wall; Twa,in is the temperature of the wall internal surface; ρwa is the wall density; Cwa is the heat capacity of the wall; Tinr is the temperature of the air-return zone; Qsunfu is the solar radiation energy absorbed by the external surface of the wall; Qsunen is the solar radiation energy hitting the inner surface of the wall; Qinner is the energy transferred to the inner surface of the wall by radiation for the indoor heat source. Using the same method as above, the energy balance equation of the floor can be obtained: (6) λ fl 1 4 δ fl A fl ( T f l 2 - T fl , o u t ) + A fl K fl , o u t ( T fl , d o - T fl , o u t ) = 0 (7) 1 2 ρ fl δ fl A fl C fl d T f l 2 dt = λ fl 1 2 δ fl A fl ( T f l 1 - T f l 2 ) + λ fl 1 4 δ fl A fl ( T fl , o u t - T f l 2 ) (8) 1 2 ρ fl δ fl A fl C fl d T f l 1 dt = λ fl 1 4 δ fl A fl ( T fl , i n - T f l 1 ) + λ fl 1 2 δ fl A fl ( T f l 2 - T f l 1 ) (9) λ fl 1 4 δ fl A fl ( T f l 1 - T fl , i n ) + A fl K fl , i n ( T inw - T fl , i n ) + Q sunen + Q inner = 0 where λfl is the thermal conductivity of the floor; δ fl is the floor thickness; Tfl,do is the downstairs temperature; Kfl,out is the heat transfer coefficient between the outer surface of the floor and downstairs air; Kfl,in is the heat transfer coefficient between the inner surface of floor and indoor air; Tfl,out is the downstairs roof temperature; Tfl1 is the first node temperature of the floor; Tfl2 is the second node temperature of the floor; Tfl,in is the interior surface temperature of the floor; Afl is the floor area; ρ fl is the floor density; Cfl is the floor heat capacity; Tins is the temperature of the air-supply zone. The complex process of outdoor air temperature and solar radiation transferring energy to the interior through the building envelope is reduced to simple mathematical problems, as shown in Eq.(2)-(9). The RC network two-node wall structure method is used to insert two nodes inside the building envelope, so that the established energy balance equation can reflect the energy transfer process of the building envelope more accurately. The air-conditioning zone of the room is divided into three zones, namely the air-supply zone, the work zone, and the air-return zone, as shown in Fig. 2. To establish the energy balance equation for each zone, it is necessary to consider the energy entering and flowing out of each zone, as well as the influence of heat and air disturbance in the zone. Therefore, the energy balance equations of the air-supply zone, air- return zone and work zone can be obtained by Eq. (1), as follows: The energy equation in the air-supply zone is: (10) ρ a V ins C a d T ins dt = K wa , i n A wa , s ( T wa , i n - T ins ) + K fl , i n A fl , s ( T fl , i n - T ins ) + G sa C a ( T sa - T ins ) where Tins is the temperature of the air-supply zone; Tsa is the supply air temperature; Gsa is the mass flow of the supply air; Vins is the volume of the air-supply zone; ρa is the air density; Ca is the air heat capacity; Awa,s is the contact area between the air-supply zone and wall; Afl,s is the contact area between the air-supply zone and floor. The energy equation in the work zone is: (11) ( ρ a V inw C a + C f ) d T inw dt = K wa , i n A wa , w ( T wa , i n - T inw ) + K win A win ( T out - T inw ) + K fl , i n A fl , w ( T fl , i n - T inw ) + G sa C a ( T sa - T inw ) + ∑ i ρ a V adj , i C a R ( T adj , i - T inw ) + K la A la ( T la - T inw ) where Tinw is the temperature of the work zone; Awa,w is the contact area between the work zone and wall; Kwin is the heat transfer coefficient of the window and outdoor air; Awin is the area of the window; Afl,w is the contact area between the work zone and wall; Tla is the average temperature of the indoor heat source; Gsa is the mass flow of the supply air; Vin is the volume of the work zone; Cf is the indoor furniture heat capacity; R is the number of air changes; V adj , i is the volume of the adjacent room i; Tadj,i , is the temperature of the adjacent room i; Kla is the heat transfer coefficient of the heat source. The energy equation in the air-return zone is: (12) ρ a V inr C a d T inr dt = K wa , i n A wa , r ( T wa , i n - T inr ) + G sa C a ( T ins - T inr ) + G sa C a ( T inw - T inr ) where Vinr is the volume of the air-return zone; Awa,r is the contact area between the air-return zone and wall. The dynamic coupling model of temperature and humidity in air-conditioning rooms not only considers the influence of building envelope and indoor and outdoor environmental parameters on room temperature, but also considers the influence of indoor air humidity on room temperature. Therefore, the humidity balance equation of each zone is established to analyze the coupling relation between indoor temperature and humidity. The humidity balance equation in the air-supply zone is: (13) V ins ρ s d M ins dt = G s a 1 M sa - G s a 2 M i n r where Vins is the volume of the air-supply zone; ρs is the air density of the air- supply zone; Mins is the air humidity of air-supply zone; Gsa1 is the mass flow of the supply air; Msa is the humidity of the supply air; Gsa2 is the mass flow of the return air; Minr is the air humidity of the air-return zone. The humidity balance equation in the air-return zone is: (14) V inr ρ a d M inr dt = G sa , s w M ins - G sa , s w M inw + ∑ i ρ a V adj , i R ( M adj , i - M inw ) where Vinr is the volume of the air-return zone; ρ a is the air density of the air-return zone; Gsa,sw is the air mass flow from the air-supply zone to the work zone; Gsa,sr is the air mass flow from the air-supply zone to the air-return zone; Minw is the air humidity of the work zone; Vadj,i is the volume of the adjacent room i; Madj,i is the humidity of the adjacent room i. The humidity equation in the work zone is: (15) ρ w V inw d M inw dt = G sa M ins - G sa M inw + ∑ i ρ w V adj , i C a R ( M adj , i - M inw ) where Vinw is the volume of the work zone; ρw is the air density of the work zone; Minw is the humidity of the work zone. 2.1.3 Solution of the dynamic temperature and humidity Energy balance equations Eq.(2) - (12) of the wall, floor joints and air-conditioning room are combined, variables Twa,out , Twa,in , Tfl,out and Tfl,in are eliminated, and the temperature response equation of each node of the wall and each zone in a single room can be obtained: (16) 1 2 ρ wa δ wa A wa C wa d T w a 1 dt = ( 4 λ wa δ wa A wa 1 + δ wa K wa , i n 4 λ wa - 6 λ wa δ wa A wa ) T w a 1 + 2 λ wa δ wa A wa T w a 2 + K wa , i n A wa 1 + δ wa K wa , i n 4 λ wa T inr + Q sunen + Q inner 1 + δ wa K wa , i n 4 λ wa (17) 1 2 ρ wa δ wa A wa C wa d T w a 2 dt = 2 λ wa δ wa A wa T w a 1 + ( 4 λ wa δ wa A wa 1 + δ wa K wa , o u t 4 λ wa - 6 λ wa δ wa A wa ) T w a 2 + K wa , o u t A wa 1 + δ wa K wa , o u t 4 λ wa T out + Q sunfu 1 + δ wa K wa , o u t 4 λ wa (18) 1 2 ρ fl δ fl A fl C fl d T f l 1 dt = ( 4 λ fl δ fl A fl 1 + δ fl K fl , i n 4 λ fl - 6 λ fl δ fl A fl ) T f l 1 + 2 λ fl δ fl A fl T f l 2 + K fl , i n A fl 1 + δ fl K fl , i n 4 λ fl T ins + Q sunen + Q inner 1 + δ fl K fl , i n 4 λ fl (19) 1 2 ρ fl δ fl A fl C fl d T f l 2 dt = ( 4 λ fl δ fl A fl 1 + δ fl K fl , o u t 4 λ fl - 6 λ fl δ fl A fl ) T f l 2 + 2 λ fl δ fl A fl T f l 1 + A fl K fl , o u t 1 + δ fl K fl , o u t 4 λ fl T out (20) ( ρ a V inw C a + C f ) d T inw dt = K wa , i n A wa , w ( 4 λ wa δ wa T w a 1 + K wa , i n T inr 4 λ wa δ wa + K wa , i n - T inw ) + K win A win ( T out - T inw ) + K fl , i n A fl , w ( 4 λ fl δ fl T f l 1 + K fl , i n T ins 4 λ fl δ fl + K fl , i n - T inw ) + G sa C a ( T sa - T inw ) + ∑ i ρ a V adj , i C a R ( T adj , i - T inw ) + K la A la ( T la - T inw ) (21) ρ a V ins C a d T ins dt = K wa , i n A wa , s ( 4 λ wa δ wa T w a 1 + K wa , i n T inr 4 λ wa δ wa + K wa , i n - T ins ) + K fl , i n A fl , s ( 4 λ fl δ fl T f l 1 + K fl , i n T ins 4 λ fl δ fl + K fl , i n - T ins ) + G sa C a ( T sa - T ins ) (22) ρ a V inr C a d T inr dt = K wa , i n A wa , r ( 4 λ wa δ wa T w a 1 + K wa , i n T inr 4 λ wa δ wa + K wa , i n - T inr ) + G sa C a ( T ins - T inr ) + G sa C a ( T inw - T inr ) By Eq.(16) - (22), the change of indoor temperature in a multi-zone room is not only related to the instantaneous cooling load caused by outdoor air temperature, solar radiation and heat transfer into the room by indoor heat sources, but also related to the indoor temperature, supply air volume, return air volume, supply air temperature and other variables of the VAV air-conditioning system, as well as the room temperature of the adjacent room. Eq.(13)-(22) is written in the matrix form of first-order differential equation as follows: (23) C dX dt = A X + B U where A, B, C are correlation coefficients. The system variable vector is: (24) X = [ T w a 1 , T w a 2 , T f l 1 , T f l 2 , T ins , T inw , T inr , M inw ] T The disturbance vector is: (25) U = [ T out , G sa , T la , T adj , i , M adj , i , Q sunen + Q inner 1 + δ wa K wa , i n 4 λ wa , Q sunfu 1 + δ wa K wa , o u t 4 λ wa , Q sunen + Q inner 1 + δ fl K fl , i n 4 λ fl ] Multiplying both sides of the equation with C - , we have: (26) dX dt = C - A X + C - B U Eq.(26) is the dynamic response equation of indoor temperature and humidity change in a single air-conditioning room. Because the temperature and humidity in the air-conditioning room will change dynamically with time due to indoor and outdoor environmental factors. Therefore, Eq.(26) is integrated over time, and the solution of X is: (27) X ( t ) = e C - A X X ( 0 ) + e C - A X ∫ 0 t e - e C - A τ C - B U ( τ ) d τ 2.1.4 Multi-zone room air coupling model The air in a multi-zone room generally flows through two channels, windows and doors. During the air flow, the energy and quality of the indoor air are exchanged with the surrounding air. According to the law of conservation of mass, the amount of air flowing into and out of a room is conserved. In this study, the multi-zone building is divided into N zones. Because of different room structures in the building, assuming each room is composed of M faces, and there are multiple common faces in each room of the whole building. When there is pressure difference between the two zones, hot-pressing ventilation will occur in these two zones. The Bernoulli principle can be used to calculate the air flow exchanged between any two zones i and j in the multi-zone building. If the air in zone i is stationary relative to zone j, then: (28) q i - j = v j · A = 2 P i ρ i - 2 P j ρ j · A where P i is the pressure of the zone i; P j is the pressure of the zone j; ρ i is the air density of the zone i; ρ j is the air density of the zone j; v j is the air velocity of the zone j penetrating into the zone i through doors and windows; A is the area between the zone i and zone j that can be permeated by air. Take any zone i in the multi-zone building according to the law of conservation of mass, then: (29) g ( m i ) = ∂ m i ∂ t = ρ i ∂ V i ∂ t + V i ∂ ρ i ∂ t = ∑ k = 1 n f ( ρ k , ρ i ) . q i - k f ( ρ k , ρ i ) = ρ k , Δ P > 0 ρ i , Δ P < 0 where mi is the air amount in the zone i; g ( m i ) is the change of air amount in the zone i per unit time; ρ i is the air density in the zone i; ρ k is the air density in the zone k adjacent to the zone i; Vi is the volume of the zone i; q i - k is the amount of air infiltration through windows and doors between the zone i and zone j; f ρ k , ρ i is the density value function of the zone i and zone k; Δ P is the pressure difference between the zone k and zone i ( Δ P = P k - P i ). According to the law of conservation of mass, the amount of air flowing into and out in a zone is also conserved, then: (30) g ( m i ) = 0 The whole building is divided into N zones, and the change of air amount per unit time in a zone is as follows: (31) g i ( m 1 , m 2 , . . . m i - 1 , . . . , m i + 1 , . . . , m N ) = ∑ k = 1 n f ( ρ k , ρ i ) . q i - k , i = 1 , 2 , . . . , N . where g i ( m 1 , m 2 , . . . m i - 1 , . . . , m i + 1 , . . . , m N ) is the variation of air amount per unit time in zone i under the combined action of N-1 zones. For the multi-zone building, each zone also satisfies the law of mass conservation, then: (32) g i ( m 1 , m 2 , . . . m i - 1 , . . . , m i + 1 , . . . , m N ) = 0 The variation of air amount in unit time of N zones in the whole building can be expressed as a vector form: (33) G ( M ) = g 1 ( y ) g 2 ( y ) . . . g N ( y ) , M = m 1 m 2 . . . m N , y = m 1 m 2 ⋮ m i - 1 ⋮ m i + 1 ⋮ m N , 0 = 0 0 . . . 0 , i = 1 , 2 , . . . , N . where G ( M ) is the change of air amount per unit time in the whole building. For the multi-zone building, the whole building also satisfies the law of mass conservation, then: (34) G ( M ) = 0 2.1.5 Establishment of multi-zone building model In a multi-zone building, when analyzing the factors that cause the temperature and humidity changes in a room, the indoor environment parameters of the adjacent room can be used as the outdoor environment parameters of the room to establish the energy balance equations of each node. Extend the single-zone mathematical model to the multi-zone mathematical model, establish the coupling model of temperature and humidity in multi-zone building, and solve the dynamic response equation of the temperature in each room, so as to obtain the temperature and humidity of each room in the whole building. The single-room model is C dX dt = A X + B U . Assuming a building has n rooms numbered from 1 to n, then the multi-zone model shall be: (35) C 1 0 0 0 0 0 C 2 0 0 0 0 0 C 3 0 0 ⋮ ⋮ ⋮ ⋮ ⋮ 0 0 0 0 C n d X 1 dt d X 2 dt d X 3 dt ⋮ d X n dt = A 1 0 0 0 0 0 A 2 0 0 0 0 0 A 3 0 0 ⋮ ⋮ ⋮ ⋮ ⋮ 0 0 0 0 A n X 1 X 2 X 3 ⋮ X n + B 1 0 0 0 0 0 B 2 0 0 0 0 0 B 3 0 0 ⋮ ⋮ ⋮ ⋮ ⋮ 0 0 0 0 B n U 1 U 2 U 3 ⋮ U n The solution to Eq. (35) is the same to Eq. (26), then Xn as: (36) X n ( t ) = e C n - A n X n X n ( 0 ) + e C n - A n X n ∫ 0 t e - e C n - A n τ C n - B n U n ( τ ) d τ 2.2 Predictive control model of room temperature The multi-zone building mathematical model constructed by the energy balance theory can only dynamically adjust the room temperature according to the change of air supply, the set value of air supply temperature and the change of instantaneous cooling load entering the room through various channels. However, the theoretical model cannot dynamically adjust the room temperature by adjusting the opening degree of VAV BOX air damper and the speed of the supply fan. This leads to the lag phenomenon of room temperature on the opening degree of VAV BOX air damper, fan speed and other adjustment changes. In order to solve the above problems, this study uses RBF NN. The structure of RBF NN is composed of input layer, hidden layer and output layer. It can approximate any nonlinear function, and it has the ability of online learning and prediction. According to the room real-time situation, it can control the opening degree of the VAV BOX air damper and the speed of the fan, so as to control the controlled amount of the air supply and make the room temperature reach the target value. Based on the periodic predictive control principle of time-delay systems, the predictive control model of a room temperature is established by using the RBF NN and multi-zone building mathematical model. In the predictive control model, the room temperature can be obtained by inputting the opening degree of the air damper and the fan speed. The multi-zone building mathematical model and RBF NN model constitute the parallel structure shown in Fig. 4 . The supply air volume L ( τ - 1 ) , disturbance U ( τ - 1 ) , room temperature T ( τ - 1 ) simulated by the multi-zone building mathematical model and room temperature first derivative T \u2032 ( τ - 1 ) = T ( τ - 1 ) - T ( τ - 2 ) are used as the input of the RBF NN model to predict the room temperature T p ( τ ) at the next moment. The deviation E between the output of the multi-zone building model and RBF NN model is calculated in the training process of RBF NN. In order to ensure the prediction accuracy of RBF NN, it is necessary to set a threshold for E, thus forming a supervised learning structure. The threshold was set as 0.6 according to the results of multiple training of RBF NN. Under the condition of E ≤ 0.6 , the trained RBF NN model can well describe the dynamic characteristics of the room temperature delay system. The room temperature T p ( τ ) predicted by the RBF NN model is fed back to the input end of the RBF NN and the PI algorithm. The RBF NN model predicts the room temperature T p ( τ + 1 ) at the next moment according to room temperature T p ( τ ) . The PI algorithm calculates the opening degree of the terminal air damper according to the deviation between the room temperature predicted value T p ( τ ) and the room temperature set value T sp . The terminal air damper periodically adjusts the opening degree according to the control cycle S c , and adjusts the air supply volume L into the room, which causes the change of static pressure of the pipeline. The direct digital control (DDC) of the fan inverter adjusts the speed of the fan in real time according to the static pressure change measured by the static pressure sensor in the pipeline, and then adjusts the total air supply to maintain the static pressure of the air supply pipeline system. By controlling the opening degree of the air damper and the speed of the fan, the air volume into the room is adjusted, and the room temperature is adjusted. If E > 0.6 , the RBF NN is retrained by using the room temperature calculated by the multi-zone building model. This paper applies the predictive control model to the terminal control device of a VAV air-conditioning system and adopts the VAV air-conditioning pressure-dependent terminal control that can effectively suppress the influence of the terminal inlet pressure disturbance on the room temperature. The specific implementation process of the predictive control model is as follows: (1) The system collects parameters that affect the room temperature, including the position of the VAV terminal air damper, fan speed, air supply temperature and air supply volume. (2) Calculate the predicted room temperature by the RBF NN. (3) According to the deviation between the predicted value of the room temperature and the set value, calculate the opening degree of the terminal air damper and output the air damper position according to the control cycle. 3 Validation of Multi-zone building model In order to verify the multi-zone building model established in this study can real time simulate the dynamic change of room temperature, the temperature and humidity of a single room are simulated and analyzed firstly. Then the room temperature of each room in the multi-zone building is simulated and analyzed based on results of the single-room analysis. The calibration of experimental instruments for measuring building envelope parameters was made before the experiment. The building envelope and indoor and outdoor environmental parameters as shown in Table 1 . 3.1 Single-room simulation In order to improve the accuracy of the model, the mathematical model of a single room is first verified. A single room shown in Fig. 1, the initial temperature of the room is set at 15 °C, and the initial room humidity ratio is set at 11.5 g/(kg dry air). Under the condition of cold air transported to a single room, the dynamics of the room temperature and humidity of a single room, the temperature of each node of the wall and the floor were simulated in the MATLAB software according to the building envelope and indoor and outdoor environmental parameters. The simulation results are shown in Fig. 5 . Fig. 5(a) shows the dynamic response curves of the temperature of each node of the wall and floor and room temperature simulated by MATLAB software, and Fig. 5(b) shows the dynamic response curve of room humidity ratio simulated by MATLAB software. As shown in Fig. 5(a), the temperature at each point changes slowly after 1000 s, and the temperature of the first node of the wall and floor is basically stable after 1000 s. While the temperature of the second node of the wall and floor still changes slightly after 1000 s, especially the second node of the wall. The room temperature still changes slightly after 1000 s, tends to be stable around 2000 s, and keeps at 12.4℃. From the simulation data of the single room, the temperature of each node of the wall and floor is significantly higher than the room temperature, and the stabilized room temperature is also higher than the supply air temperature. It shows that the outdoor environment transfers energy to the interior through the building envelope and participates in the change of room temperature; it also verifies that the single-room model can simulate the dynamic change of the room temperature. It also shows that the RC network two-node wall structure method to solve the energy changes of the building walls and floors is correct, and provides a theoretical method to establish a multi-zone building model. As shown in Fig. 5(b), although the room air humidity ratio is constantly changing, the variation is small, and the room air humidity ratio is between 10.6 g/(kg dry air) and 11.5 g/(kg dry air). The humidity ratio tends to be stable and close to Msa . 3.2 Multi-room simulation Fig. 6 is a three-story office building with six rooms each floor and a basement. The building is located in Dalian, China, which belongs to a cold region. The building is separated by a corridor. This study only simulated the front section because this building is symmetric. Each room in the building has the same structure as the room in the single-room model, and the building envelope has the same parameters. In order to verify the accuracy of multi-zone building model, this research carries out experimental verification in the above-mentioned building for the indoor temperature changes without/with air conditioning. The scenario without air conditioning is to simulate the accidental shut down of the air conditioning system. The simulation result of the single room shows that the indoor humidity ratio has a small change, so this section does not consider the humidity transport. 3.2.1 Simulation without air conditioning The experiment was carried out in January. Initially, the same heat was provided in each room, and the room temperature in each room reached a steady state after a period of time. Then the heating in all rooms was turned off, and the temperature in the room was measured with an automatic temperature recorder. The automatic temperature recorder was installed in the middle of the room and 1.5 m from the ground, and recorded the room temperature every minute. This measurement lasted for 2000 s. During the experiment, the experimental room had no changes in heating load such as heat dissipation from electrical equipment and human body, so the room heating load did not change much and could be regarded as unchanged. The measured average temperature of the basement was 3℃ in the process of collecting room temperature, and the average outdoor air temperature and the average solar radiation intensity were −6℃ and 3386.11 W/ m 2 . The initial temperature of each room in the experiment is different due to different locations and different operation conditions. The multi-zone building model is used to simulate the dynamic change of room temperature when the air-conditioning system stops suddenly. The simulation results are shown in Fig. 7 . The real-time change curves of the measured temperature values and the simulated temperature values of each room are almost the same. As shown in Fig. 7(a), during the period of 500 s-1000 s in Room 1, the simulated temperature value is larger than the measured temperature value, but the difference between them is less than 0.5 °C. As shown in Fig. 7(b), the measured temperature is greater than the simulated temperature during the period of 1000 s-2000 s in Room 7, but the difference between them is less than 0.5 °C. The real-time changing simulated temperature value of other rooms is almost the same as the measured temperature value, and the difference between them is less than 0.2 °C. The large difference between the measured and simulated temperature values of Room 1 and Room 7 may be caused by some factors such as the time delay of the measuring instrument. In general, the multi-zone building model can accurately simulate the dynamic change of room temperature when the air-conditioning system suddenly stops in real time. Room 1 is on the top floor, and the room temperature drops very quickly, falling below 0 °C after 1400 s as shown in Fig. 7(a). Because Room 2 is in the middle of the top floor, the temperature drops to 3 °C after 1400 s as shown in Fig. 7(b). As shown in Fig. 7(d), the temperature in Room 4 is higher than that in Room 1, because it is a middle floor and has less heat loss. The temperature of Room 5 is higher than that of other rooms, and the room temperature remains 7℃ after 2000 s as shown in Fig. 7(e). This is because the room is located in the middle of the whole building and has minimal heat loss. As shown in Fig. 7(g)-(i), When the room temperature is stable, the temperature in Rooms 7, 8, and 9 are around 2 °C. Since these rooms are located on the first floor and the basement temperature is higher than the outdoor temperature, the heat loss of these rooms is small. It can be found that considering indoor air convection and heat transfer between the upper and lower floors, the multi-zone building model can simulate the dynamic changes of room temperature more accurately. 3.2.2 Simulation with air conditioning Based on the above-mentioned experimental platform and same setup, the experiment was carried out in July under the condition that the building was air-conditioned. The initial condition is to turn off the air-conditioning in the room so that the temperature reached a stable state. Turning on the air-conditioning indicates the beginning of the experiment, and the automatic temperature recorder is used to measure the room temperature at the same time. The supply air temperature is 10 °C and the mass flow rate of each room is 0.08 kg/s. The air damper opening degree of each room is the same. During the measurement, the average temperature in the basement was 24℃. The average outdoor temperature was 31℃, and the average solar radiation intensity was 813.89 W/m2. Similarly, the measurement also lasted for 2000 s. The multi-zone building model established in this study is used to simulate the dynamic change of room temperature when the air-conditioning system is in normal operation. The simulation results are shown in Fig. 8 . The measured temperature and the simulated temperature of each room are synchronized and drop rapidly with time, and the real-time difference between them is less than 0.2 °C. It shows that the multi-zone building model can accurately simulate the dynamic changes of room temperature with air-conditioning in real time. The temperature of each room reaches a stable state after 1000 s, but the temperature of each room is different, which shows that the multi-zone building model can accurately and real-time simulate the dynamic change of the room temperature with the air-conditioning in different external environments. For multi-room, the location and usage of each room are different. When the indoor air temperature of the adjacent room of a certain room is higher, the temperature of the room will drop more slowly. However, due to the small heat capacity of the indoor air in adjacent rooms, the heat transfer through the wall is not large, and the temperature change of the room has little effect, and the outdoor air temperature is the main factor that affects the room temperature change. 4 Predictive control of multi-zone VAV air-conditioning system According to theory of time-delay system theory for VAV air-conditioning room temperature, the room temperature delay time to the terminal air damper adjusting is determined first by the experimental study of the room temperature delay response characteristics. The periodic predictive control model of room temperature time-delay system based on RBF NN and multi-zone building model is applied to the terminal control experimental platform in multi-zone VAV air-conditioning system to verify its control effect. At the same time, the indoor real-time temperature of the terminal control experimental platform, the air volume into the room and terminal air damper position are measured when the predictive control model is running. In order to illustrate the advantages of predictive control model in multi-zone VAV air-conditioning system. The predictive control model in this study is compared with Elman NN predictive control model for the control effect of multi-zone VAV air-conditioning system under the same conditions. 4.1 Room temperature delay response characteristics With the variation of the terminal air damper opening degree, the air supply volume of VAV terminal box changes, which further affects the indoor air temperature. The dynamic response of room temperature is delayed during the air supply volume adjustment process. In order to study the room temperature delay time to the terminal air damper adjusting, this study uses an experimental platform for a multi-zone VAV air-conditioning system, which is located in Rooms 7, 8 and 9 shown in Fig. 6. The structure of the multi-zone VAV air-conditioning systems shown in Fig. 9 , each room has a VAV box. The supply air static pressure sensor is located on the main supply air pipe. The main equipment parameters of the VAV air-conditioning system are shown in Table 2 . The step response method is used to determine the delay time of the room temperature to the terminal air damper through experiments in summer and winter conditions. During the experiment, the opening degree of the terminal air damper in the three rooms were the same. In order to ensure good indoor air distribution and air quality, the minimum air damper opening degree was 30%. Therefore, this article only studies the room temperature delay time of the terminal air damper adjustment when the air damper position changes between 30% and 100%. Fig. 10 (a) shows the room temperature response curves of three rooms when the terminal air damper is adjusted under summer conditions. The air damper of the VAV junction box was maintained the minimum opening degree during 0\u201320 min. Manually adjust the air damper opening degree from 30% to 100% after 20 min. The temperature of three rooms dropped significantly at the 24th minute. Manually adjust the air damper opening degree from 100% to 30% at the 100th minute. The temperature in three rooms rose at the 104th minute significantly. In winter and summer, the terminal air damper regulation is the same, and the room temperature response curves of three rooms under the terminal air damper regulation in winter are shown in Fig. 10 (b). The experiment showed that the room temperature decreased or increased significantly after the terminal air damper was adjusted for 4 min. Therefore, changing the opening degree of the terminal air damper has a certain delay on the change of room temperature, and the delay time is about 4 min. 4.2 Predictive control of multi-zone VAV air-conditioning system In the multi-zone VAV air-conditioning system for Rooms 7, 8, and 9, the predictive control model is used to adjust the position of the terminal air damper continuously, so as to realize the periodical adjustment of the air supply volume and change the room temperature. The control period of VAV air-conditioning system is approximately equal to the delay response time of room temperature, that is, 4 min. This study uses Matlab software to load the RBF NN and Elman NN predictive algorithm into Simulink PLC Coder and then import the generated source file code to the SIMATIC S7-1200 programmable controller to realize the control. In order to verify the accuracy of the room temperature dynamic response of the multi-zone building model when the air volume of each room is constantly changing, and ensure that the deviation between the predicted room temperature value and the room temperature set value output by the RBF NN under the condition of E that can be calculated by the PI algorithm, so that the air volume into the room can meet the demand. In the experiment, the indoor and outdoor environmental parameters are measured in real time, and the multi-zone building model will simulate the dynamic change of real-time temperature in each room. This experiment installs an electronic air flow measuring instrument FLY-1 in the VAV box of each room and records the air volume every minute. The supply air temperature is 16 °C. The indoor and outdoor temperature is measured every minute by self-recorder HOBO U23-001.The outdoor radiation intensity is measured by Solar Power Meter SM206. Fig. 11 shows outdoor solar radiation intensity (W/m2) and outdoor temperature (℃). The measurements last for five hours. The training of RBF NNs with different numbers of neurons in hidden layers is to determine the optimal structure. During the training, four neurons were first set in the hidden layer, and two more neurons were successively added after each training. The deviation E between the output of multi-zone building model and RBF NN model was taken as the criterion for stopping training of RBF NN. By comparing the results of multiple trainings, the RBF NN with 16 neurons in hidden layer was selected to predict indoor temperature, and the corresponding training time was 68.26 s. The room temperature predictive control by RBF NN and the simulated indoor temperature change by multi-zone building model are shown in Fig. 12 . The initial temperature of Rooms 7 and 8 are 30.8 °C and 29.5 °C respectively and the setpoints are 25 °C and 22 °C respectively as shown in Fig. 12(a) and Fig. 12(c). After 300 mins of operation and adjustment, the room temperature reaches the set value requirements. The indoor temperature of Room 7 reaches the set temperature for the first time in about 30 min. Due to the change of indoor and outdoor environment and the fluctuation of supply air static pressure of VAV air -conditioning, the ambient temperature is unstable and the fan speed changes, resulting in room temperature fluctuation. But the RBF NN has strong predictive performance, it can still accurately predict the change of the indoor temperature when the input parameters change. When the predictive control model based on the RBF NN outputs the optimal predictive value, according to the deviation between the predicted value and the set value of room temperature, the opening degree of the air damper can be calculated by PI algorithm and adjusted regularly according to the control cycle, and the indoor air supply volume can be changed to adjust the room temperature. This control method can reduce the frequency and amplitude of the air damper and indoor temperature fluctuations, and make the room temperature fluctuations smaller. In order to verify the anti-interference ability of the RBF NN in the room temperature predictive control, the doors and windows of the Room 9 were opened from 12:00 to 13:00 to increase the heat load. The initial temperature of the Room 9 is 30.8℃, and the set temperature is 25℃ shown in Fig. 12(e). The room temperature suddenly increased during this period, and the input parameters were not adjusted in time. Therefore, the RBF NN has a certain error in predicting the room temperature in a short time in this process, but the RBF NN can make corresponding adjustments in time, accurately predict the room temperature, adjust the air damper opening degree in time, and change the indoor air supply volume. In the process of opening the doors and windows of the Room 9 to increase the heat load, the room temperature dropped rapidly at 12:20 and reached the set value at 12:45 for the first time. The process takes 45 min, and the frequency and amplitude of the room temperature fluctuation become smaller after reaching the set value. As shown in Fig. 12 (b), Fig. 12 (d), and Fig. 12 (f), the position of the air damper is adjusted by the RBF NN and the periodic predictive control model of the room temperature time-delay system of the multi-zone building model, and the fluctuation frequency of the air damper is relatively small. In this experiment, the simulated temperature using multi-zone building model agrees well with the measured temperature. It is proved again that the multi-zone building model established in this study can simulate the dynamic room temperature in real time and accurately. In order to compare the control effect of the predictive control model established in this study and the Elman NN predictive control model on the terminal control of multi-zone VAV system under the same working conditions. The predictive control of the same multi-zone VAV air-conditioning system based on Elman NN is conducted. In order to ensure that the initial temperature of each room is the same as the initial temperature of each room in the above experiment, the air-conditioning system is used to adjust the indoor temperature of the three rooms before the experiment. The outdoor environment changes during the experiment are shown in Fig. 13 . The room temperature predicted by Elman NN and room temperature change simulated by multi-zone building model are shown in Fig. 14 . The indoor temperature of room 7 also reached the set temperature for the first time in about 30 min as shown in Fig. 14 (a). Due to the change of indoor and outdoor environment and the fluctuation of supply air static pressure of VAV air-conditioning, the ambient temperature is unstable and the fan speed changes, resulting in room temperature fluctuation. This method can also predict room temperature changes as input parameters change. Fig. 14 (c) shows Room 8 reaching the set temperature in about 25 min. However, the error between the predicted value and the actual value is large, and the room temperature fluctuation is large. Fig. 14 (e) shows that during 12:00\u201313:00, all doors and windows in Room 9 are opened to increase the heat load. During this period, the room temperature dropped rapidly at 12:35 and reached the set value for the first time at 13:00. The process lasts 60 min. When the environment changes abruptly, the predictive control model fails to make corresponding adjustments in time, resulting in a large deviation between the room temperature and the set temperature. As shown in Fig. 14 (b), Fig. 14 (d), and Fig. 14 (f), the position of the air damper is adjusted by the Elman NN predictive control model, and the fluctuation frequency of the air damper is relatively large. It shows that the predictive control model in this study is more stable and faster than the Elman NN predictive control model in predicting the room temperature effect. By quantitative analysis on the experimental results in Fig. 12 and Fig. 14. The average differences between the room temperature predicted by the model and the measured temperature of the Room 7, Room 8 and Room 9 are 0.31 °C, 0.35 °C and 0.38 °C, respectively. With the Elman NN model, the average difference between the predicted room temperature and the measured value of Room 7, Room 8 and Room 9 is 0.42 °C, 0.66 °C and 0.68 °C, respectively. For example, in room 8, the predicted room temperature by Elman NN model and the setpoint deviate greatly. The opening degree of the air damper and the air supply volume fluctuates greatly. The predicted value and the setpoint of room temperature are similar. The air damper opening degree and the air supply volume has little fluctuation and is more stable. The similar phenomenon would be observed in the results of other rooms. The air volume sent into the room by the terminal equipment of the VAV air-conditioning system can meet the air volume demand of the room, and the influence of the pressure change in the air supply pipe on the experimental control effect is reduced. The static pressure control method is adopted in the experiment. The WH131 static pressure sensor is installed in the middle of the main air supply duct between rooms 8 and 9. The static pressure of the supply air is set to 60 Pa. As shown in Fig. 15 , with the control by RBF NN, although the static pressure of the supply air fluctuates with little amplitude. However, the predictive control by the Elman NN has greater fluctuations in the static pressure of the air supply compared with that of the RBF NN. When the predictive control model based on the RBF NN and multi-zone building model is used, the average deviation between the supply air static pressure and the set value is 2.01 Pa. While the Elman NN predictive control model is used, the average deviation between the supply air static pressure and the set value is 8.25 Pa. The comparisons further confirm that the control by RBF NN is more stable. 5 Conclusions In order to establish a multi-zone building model that can simulate real-time changes of room temperature based on air volume changes, building envelope and indoor and outdoor environmental parameters, this research proposes the RC network two-node wall structure method. This method first divides building envelope such as walls and floors into two-story structures, and then uses energy balance theory to establish the energy balance equation of each node. Finally, the dynamic response equations of room temperature and humidity in each room of the whole building are obtained. At the same time, a periodic predictive control model of time-delay system at room temperature based on RBF NN and multi-zone building model is proposed. This model can accurately predict and control room temperature according to the variation of air volume, building envelope and indoor and outdoor environmental parameters, and experiments are carried out in the control of multi-zone VAV air-conditioning system. The following conclusions are obtained: (1) The multi-zone building model based on RC network two-node wall structure method can accurately simulate the dynamic change of room temperature. (2) When the room setpoint temperature is low, the periodic predictive control model of time-delay systems at room temperature based on RBF NN and multi-zone building model avoids the large fluctuation of the air damper and improves the stability of room temperature. (3) The periodic predictive control model has strong anti-interference ability. It ensures stable static pressure of the main air supply duct of the multi-zone VAV air-conditioning system.

        "dc:description": "The multi-zone variable air volume (VAV) air-conditioning system is a complex thermal system with large delay and nonlinearity. Due to the complex environment of multi-zone buildings and the complicated operation process of the VAV air-conditioning system, there are many difficulties in the room temperature control. This paper firstly establishes a multi-zone building model for room temperature using resistance\u2013capacitance method. This investigation simulates and measures the dynamic response of room temperature in a three-floor building without/with air-conditioning for validation. Then a multi-zone VAV air-conditioning system room temperature predictive control model based on radial basis function (RBF) neural network (NN) is proposed. This study sets up a multi-zone VAV air-conditioning system experimental platform in the three rooms on the first floor of the building and implements the predictive control model based on the RBF neural network. The experimental results show that the predictive control model based on RBF NN is able to meet room temperature requirements. It also has strong anti-interference performance and ensures stable static pressure of the main air supply duct. The multi-zone building model can accurately simulate the temperature changes of each room when the air supply volume varies.",
