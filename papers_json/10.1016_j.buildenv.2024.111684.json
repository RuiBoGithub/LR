This study presents a consumer-centric approach on Demand-Side Management (DSM) for residential energy systems, aiming to align cost-efficient energy strategies with the individual's preferences on operational time-flexibility for residential electric appliances, thermal comfort, and indoor air quality. The optimization framework innovatively incorporates forecasts of the Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) index and thermal comfort levels using virtual sensing technology to predict their day-ahead values, which are furtherly integrated as constraints in the optimization problem. A dual-objective approach is employed, balancing the minimization of electricity costs all whilst increasing consumer's satisfaction. The approach underlines the critical role of consumer participation in DSM and illustrates how the integration of smart home technologies can lead to reductions in energy consumption and cost savings. This paradigm not only promotes consumer engagement in energy management but also showcases the potential of intelligent home systems to optimize energy usage while maintaining personalized comfort standards.

The strategic application of technologies and practices to systematically reduce energy consumption while preserving services reliability and performance, is pivotal in diminishing the EU's carbon footprint and promoting sustainable growth. In 2021, 40 % of the total energy demand across the EU was attributable to buildings [2], with residencies accounting for a significant 67 % of this demand, constituting 18.6 % of the gross inland energy consumption in the EU [2]. This substantial portion of energy consumption is primarily driven by the necessity for maintaining a thermally comfortable indoor environment, as heating alone accounts for 64.4 % [2] of residencies' total energy usage, underscoring the challenge for effective management of residential heating and cooling systems. In this context, it becomes imperative to pursue a balanced approach that ensures cost-effective operation of residential flexible power loads, while minimizing the disruption of the consumers' daily routine and improving their overall environmental comfort experience, which can lead to significant improvements on health outcomes. In their review study, William J. Fisk [3] synthesized findings indicating that low indoor temperatures and inadequate thermal comfort are often associated with negative health outcomes. Additionally, the review suggests that improvements in indoor air quality are consistently linked with better respiratory health outcomes in non-asthma conditions and overall general health. Demand-Side Management (DSM) has emerged as a pivotal component of residential energy management systems, fundamental to optimizing energy consumption, minimizing energy costs, improving energy grid reliability, and facilitating the integration of renewable energy sources [4]. DSM plays a pivotal role in enhancing the robustness and resilience of energy systems, enabling them to adapt to rapid transformations within the evolving energy landscape. Consequently, they provide substantial economic and environmental advantages, by fostering synergistic interactions among a diverse array of stakeholders, ranging from consumers to utility providers. Modern DSM systems are empowered by big data analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and Internet of Things (IoT) connectivity [5]. These technologies can unlock the complex and stochastic behavioral patterns of energy consumers, providing precise insights into their energy usage dynamics [6]. Highly customized optimization algorithms aligned with individual's comfort preferences and energy usage needs mark a transformative shift towards a more personalized, data-oriented, and technologically sophisticated approach to residential energy management systems [7]. Furthermore, the efficacy of modern DSM systems is rooted on proactive consumer engagement, where end-users are active participants in the energy marketplace. This engagement is facilitated by user-friendly interfaces and real-time feedback mechanisms, empowering consumers to make informed decisions regarding their energy usage. At the core of today's energy market transformation stand the dynamic energy pricing schemes, whose incorporation to smart home systems promotes the consumer-centrism of the modern energy landscape [8]. The implementation of such schemes incentivizes efficient energy usage by consumers and aligns their energy behavioral patterns with broader energy conservation and sustainability goals. In addition, dynamic pricing schemes aim to provide a balanced approach between the enhancement of consumer's welfare, the stability, efficiency and sustainability of the energy grid, as well as the optimization of the economic outcomes for energy retail companies. In DSM, various pricing schemes are employed to encourage efficient energy use from consumers [9]. Time-of-Use (ToU) pricing differentiates the cost of energy based on the time of day, discouraging use during high-demand periods with higher rates. Real-Time Pricing (RTP) moves a step further by reflecting the cost of electricity instantaneously, thus signaling consumers to adjust usage in response to price fluctuations. Critical Peak Pricing (CPP) sharpens this approach by imposing even higher rates during critical peak times, typically forecasted a day ahead, to deter consumption during system strains. Lastly, Peak Time Rebates (PTR) provide rebates to consumers who reduce their demand during these peak times, rewarding efficient energy consumption behavior. Another cornerstone for DSM is Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS), which are integral to the residential sector's energy conservation efforts, serving as an intermediate node for communication between households and utility providers [10]. By enabling the real-time transfer of energy consumption data, HEMS facilitate more informed energy usage decisions, contribute to the optimization of households' energy profiles, and enhance the overall efficiency and reliability of the power grid. This exchange not only promotes energy-saving practices but also supports providers in demand forecasting and managing peak loads, which is critical for maintaining grid stability. The inherent limitations of physical sensor systems, such as susceptibility to systematic errors, noisy signals, short lifetime, need for periodic maintenance and operational deficiencies, necessitate the evolution towards more sophisticated sensing methodologies [11]. Virtual sensing technology emerges as a robust alternative to physical sensing, harnessing the power of AI and ML to enable cost-efficient, agile, scalable, resilient, and non-intrusive data collection [12,13]. These software-based sensing systems offer a transformative solution within the IoT domain, facilitating seamless integration of data intelligence with physical sensing. Specifically, in our context, virtual sensing technology offers two critical advantages. Firstly, it obviates the need for users to be burdened with disruptive equipment on their bodies. By moving away from physical sensor reliance, we ensure a more user-friendly and non-intrusive experience. Secondly, and perhaps most crucially, virtual sensing allows for the prediction of sensor values for the upcoming day. This predictive capability is integral to our optimization efforts, enabling us to anticipate and prepare for future scenarios, thereby enhancing overall efficiency and effectiveness. The key contributions of this paper are: \u2043 The introduction of a consumer-centric approach in DSM, highlighting the shift from the legacy utility-centric paradigm of DSM to a modern, data-driven and consumer-centric one, which emphasizes the importance of aligning energy management strategies with the individual's preferences on operational time-flexibility, thermal comfort level and indoor air quality status. \u2043 The integration of the air quality index as a regulatory constraint in the optimization problem of household electric appliances scheduling, enhancing indoor air quality control while optimizing energy consumption. \u2043 Leveraging virtual sensing to integrate a precise assessment of consumer's thermal comfort level and indoor air quality status, thereby optimizing the scheduling of the AC and the AP units to align with individualized comfort and air quality preferences.

A crucial element in developing Demand Side Management (DSM) is optimizing demand. Typically, appliance scheduling takes into account time slots, user preferences, and different consumption profiles to either minimize peak demand (Qayyum., 2015) or lower energy costs [14]) DSM strategies can be designed using either heuristic [15] or deterministic algorithms (Soares, 2022). This interest is driven by the ability of these approaches to align with and adapt to consumers' preferences and daily routines. By minimizing disruptions to regular activities, consumer-centric DSM ensures a seamless integration into everyday life. The emergence of smart home technologies has facilitated the practical implementation of personalized Demand Side Management (DSM) strategies that are evolving into actionable solutions that lead to significant cost savings and enhanced energy efficiency. In several studies, an inconvenience factor (IC) has been employed to quantify and penalize deviations from typical household load schedules, measuring the level of disruption to consumer's daily routine. This factor encapsulates the concept of operational time-flexibility and serves as a balancing component in traditional load scheduling algorithms, striking a balance between cost-efficient management of household loads and minimal intrusiveness in consumer's lifestyle patterns. Lu et al. [16] integrated a weighted IC to measure the discomfort experienced by consumers due to time shifts in their regular electricity usage patterns from demand-response program participation. A lower value implies a reduced penalty for discomfort, thereby encouraging consumers to shift more load to lower their overall costs. Utilizing a balanced factor of 0.2 between cost-savings and consumer comfort, the optimized schedule resulted in a significant 34.71 % reduction in total energy costs. In the same context, Yahia et al. [17] incorporated an IC in the objective function to represent the deviation between consumer's preferred schedule, acknowledging the potential discomfort associated with shifting appliance usage. The consumers' willingness to adjust their usage is captured by the metric of flexibility ratio with a wider operational window indicating a higher tolerance for schedule adjustments to optimize energy costs. This study resulted to substantial electricity cost savings - approximately 35 % for a small-scale scenario and up to 50 % for a large-scale case - compared to consumer-defined schedules. While inconvenience factors (ICs) are important contributors in balancing cost-efficiency with user comfort, it is crucial to acknowledge certain limitations. These factors rely significantly on subjective assessments of consumer discomfort, which can vary widely between individuals. This variability introduces challenges in standardizing optimal scheduling, potentially leading to less predictable energy management outcomes. Moreover, the dependency on consumer input to determine ICs can complicate the implementation process, affecting the scalability and overall effectiveness of such systems. Charoen et al. [18] developed a comprehensive day-ahead scheduling framework coupled with an intra-day rescheduling system for flexible household loads, integrating a cost metric for consumer discomfort arising from operational shifts. The model assigns a priority value to each flexible load, reflecting its significance to the user; a high priority value indicates that any shift from the preferred operating time would result in considerable discomfort, thereby influencing the fairness of the calculated electricity costs among the community and ensuring minimal disturbance to the consumer's routine. However, this approach does introduce certain challenges, as it necessitates that users manually set the priority for each load, which can be a tedious process. This requirement potentially limits the model's practicality and user-friendliness, making it less accessible for some consumers who may find continuous interaction with the system overly demanding. M. Awais et al. [19] incorporated the peak-to-average ratio as a critical parameter among electricity costs and consumer comfort with the aim of maximizing utility for both the consumer and the grid. Furthermore, a hybrid heuristic optimization framework was designed to enhance computational efficiency in solving such complex load scheduling problems, entailing a comparative analysis of two day-ahead and critical peak pricing models to determine their cost-efficacy for consumers and stability for grid. However, the method does not allow consumers to indicate their tolerance for disruption, providing a fixed solution that lacks customization options. This constraint prevents users from adapting the system to suit their specific needs and preferences, which could lead to reduced satisfaction. D. Setlhaolo [20] used mixed integer non-linear programming to enable consumers get insights on optimal usage of their loads in regards to electricity costs and assist with the rescheduling to off peak time periods. A weighting factor α is introduced to model the flexibility of an occupant to shift demand-side elements, which is additionally an indicator of the level of inconvenience that the user would be subjected to. This study achieved a substantial reduction on the cost of electricity and additionally incorporated financial incentives for the effective application of the proposed schedule. In their study, Ghayour et al. [21]utilized mixed integer linear programming (MILP) to transition from previously favored non-linear approaches, achieving a single, optimal solution under conditions of uncertainty. This method accounts for the variability in renewable energy sources and market volatility, and incorporates both heat and electrical energy supplies, leading to a notable reduction in total energy costs. However, the adoption of this framework involves substantial retrofits such as additional boilers and combined heat and power (CHP) systems. These necessary modifications entail significant investment and complex installation procedures, which may deter widespread implementation despite the prospective cost savings. Furthermore, several studies have incorporated thermal-flexibility profiles within the optimization strategies, extending the consumer-centrism in DSM beyond the operational time-flexibility profiles. These approaches handle cooling and heating systems not merely as appliances but as integral components that shape the living environment. E. Shirazi et al. [22] proposed a discomfort index that integrates both the preferred temperature range, defined as the average between the upper and lower temperature limits, and the deviation from the preferred operational time window for household appliances. In A. Agnetis et al. study [23], the optimization problem is structured to maximize both consumer's scheduling and climatic comfort preferences. Climatic comfort is an index value, representing the consumer's willingness to maintain the indoor temperature of the household within the desired lower and upper boundaries. Anvari-Moghaddam et al. [24] devised a multi-objective optimization framework with distinct objectives for maximizing consumer convenience and thermal comfort. Consumer's thermal comfort is evaluated using a time-series, which integrates lags of indoor temperature data, user-defined temperature setpoints, and deviations from predefined comfort thresholds. S. Wang et al. [25] implemented a simplified adaptation of Fanger's thermal comfort model for HVAC load scheduling, considering only the indoor temperature, consumer gender, and a standardized seasonal clothing insulation value. This simplification aims to align the model with practical home energy management systems, where day-ahead prediction of all original model parameters is challenging. Lin et al. [26] integrated several models into a thermal model to study the impact of occupants' behaviors on the building energy consumption and an electric consumption model was developed to simulate the usage pattern and the electricity input to household electric appliances. Karatzas et al. [27] developed a context-driven energy management framework focusing on human factors and business processes hosted in the building, through the introduction of comfort and business process-related parameters. The major innovation of the proposed framework is that it considers the relationship between the major load types with the activities in a building, developing a linkage between energy management and organizational structures. Consequently, valuable knowledge can be gained on how everyday actions affect energy consumption, as well as how much users can potentially improve their energy consuming habits. While these studies offer valuable insights into optimizing household energy management by balancing load scheduling flexibility with thermal comfort, they predominantly focus on indoor temperature as the primary metric of environmental comfort. This approach overlooks the multifaceted nature of human comfort, which encompasses a wider range of physiological and psychological factors. The literature, therefore, indicates a research gap in developing more comprehensive environmental comfort models that integrate additional dimensions, potentially offering a more nuanced understanding of consumer preferences and behaviors in demand-side management strategies. 3 Methods and material 3.1 Integer linear programming framework In this section, an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) framework is introduced (Fig. 1 ), aimed to minimize the daily energy costs associated with controllable electricity loads in residential settings while accommodating consumer's preferences regarding scheduling, thermal comfort and air quality status. The objective of this framework extends beyond the mere cost-efficient scheduling of controllable electricity loads; it is also constrained on the preferred operational time window for each load, while ensuring that thermal comfort and air quality conditions do not violate consumer preferences. The temporal scope T under examination encompasses a full 24-h cycle, starting from 00:00 to 23:00, with each hour furtherly divided into I equal time intervals. This granular approach facilitates a dual purpose; firstly, to incorporate the patterns of energy demand with a higher degree of precision, which in turn allows for a more precise scheduling; secondly, to ensure compatibility with different electricity pricing models, specifically those that operate at a lower temporal resolution than hourly intervals (see Fig. 2). For the proposed ILP framework, the controllable residential electric appliances are classified into four (4) principal categories: (i): time-controllable loads, (ii): phase-controllable loads, (iii): air-conditioning (AC) unit, and (iv): air-purifier (AP) unit. The time-controllable loads are distinguished by their operational flexibility, allowing for scheduling of their function within strategically chosen time windows. Consumer predefines a set of preferences regarding the earliest start time (EST) and the latest end time (LET) for each time-controllable load, thus establishing a well-defined time-schedule that aligns with their daily activities. Once activated, a time-controllable load requires continuous operation to complete its cycle efficiently. In this study, the set of household loads examined comprises the washing machine (WM), the tumble drier (TD) and the dishwasher (DW). Phase-shiftable loads are characterized by operation in discrete, non-continuous phases, an attribute that facilitates strategic interruptions and subsequent resumptions during their operation cycle. Within this category, a nuanced distinction is drawn between phase-variable and phase-constant loads. Phase-variable loads are marked by their adaptability in power consumption, which can be dynamically modulated across various levels during their operational phases, enabling the optimization of energy usage in response to fluctuating energy demands and varying electricity tariff rates. Conversely, phase-constant loads are characterized by their steady power consumption throughout their operational cycle, resulting in a predictable energy demand profile. Both phase-variable and phase-constant loads share a common requirement; the necessity for a known maximum amount of power to ensure their full and efficient operation. To synchronize phase-shiftable loads with a consumer's daily routine, it is essential for the consumer to specify the earliest start time (EST) and latest end time (LET), mirroring the approach taken with time-shiftable loads, too. In the proposed ILP problem, the electric vehicle (EV) and the electric water heater (EWH) stand as the phase-variable and phase-constant load, respectively. Lastly, the non-controllable and non-shiftable residential electric loads, such as refrigerator and oven, are not omitted; they are considered as the aggregated baseline load, denoted as b t , i . The electricity tariff π t adheres to the day-ahead pricing model, yet it is adaptable for a time-of-use model if necessary. The study accounts for the variability and unpredictability of energy markets by dividing each hour into I t intervals, enabling a more responsive approach to demand-side management. The objective function (Eq (1)) represents the total energy costs by quantifying those associated with the time-controllable loads, the phase-controllable loads, the AC unit, the AP unit and the baseline load. Two monetary penalty coefficients are integrated in the objective function. They serve the purpose of integrating the deviations from consumer's desired thermal comfort range and minimum air quality index into the optimization problem, ensuring a balanced approach between minimizing the daily electricity costs and maintaining the consumer's preferences. Penalty coefficient ρ A C ( \u20ac / ° C ) quantifies the economic value consumers place on thermal comfort, monetizing each degree of temperature variance from their selected range. This calibration of comfort preferences offers a precise financial measure for temperature regulation in the optimization schema. Similarly, the penalty coefficient ρ A P ( \u20ac / I A Q ) corresponds to the financial impact associated with each incremental unit change in the air quality index from the consumer's minimum acceptable level, thereby integrating air quality standards into the economic framework of household energy management.

The binary decision variable w j , r , t , i indicates the load's activity status, subjected to constraints (Eq (2)) - (Eq (9)). Constraints (Eq (2)) and (Eq (3)) dictate the power usage and operational status within the designated time window, whereas the constraints (Eq (4)) - (Eq (6)) sequence load operations, ensuring exclusivity and adherence to the schedule. Lastly, constraints (Eq (7)) - (Eq (9)) ensure that the initiation and duration of a load's activity comply with the schedule, while maintaining power demand within established boundaries.

The operational protocols for these loads are meticulously designed to reach a predetermined supply threshold, reflecting the consumers' specific state-of-charge (SoC) or temperature preferences. Constraints (Eq (10)) - (Eq (14)) delineate the operation of phase-constant loads within a prescribed time frame, ensuring adherence to consumer-defined energy ceilings. Similarly, constraints (Eq (15)) - (Eq (20)) orchestrate the dynamic energy consumption of phase-variable loads, achieving the desired operational states within the consumer-allocated temporal boundaries. Decision variables u k , t , i and x m , t , i s serve as binary indicators of the active status for phase-constant and phase-variable loads, respectively, ensuring their integration within the household's strategic energy management schema.

Their operation is discretized into five (5) levels of operation, accounting to 0 %, 25 %, 50 %, 75 % and 100 % of their nominal power. (21) P A C = ∑ p = 0 4 0 , 25 × p × δ p , t , i × P n o m A C , t = 1 , . . , T , i = 1 , \u2026 , I t (22) P A P = ∑ p = 0 4 0 , 25 × p × δ p , t , i \u2032 × P n o m A P , t = 1 , . . , T , i = 1 , \u2026 , I t (23) ∑ p = 0 4 δ p , t , i ≤ 1 , t = 1 , . . , T , i = 1 , \u2026 , I t (24) ∑ p = 0 4 δ p , t , i \u2032 ≤ 1 , t = 1 , . . , T , i = 1 , \u2026 , I t Where P A C and P A P are the total power demand of the AC and the air purifier units respectively, P n o m A C and P n o m A P correspond to their nominal power, while δ p , t , i and δ p , t , i \u2032 are the binary decision variables. To ensure that the consumer's preferences regarding the indoor thermal comfort and indoor air quality are not violated, additional constraints are employed, as described by (Eq (25)) - (Eq (29)).

The framework's cornerstone is a virtual sensor capable of forecasting the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) and corresponding temperature on an hourly, day-ahead basis. This approach establishes a direct correlation between PMV and temperature, streamlining the process of integrating user comfort preferences into the overall optimization problem. The following subsections detail the design, development, and operational aspects of this virtual sensing framework. The thermostatic load of the AC unit functions at four (5) distinct power levels, corresponding to equal fractions of its nominal power P A C . The operation of this unit serves the purpose of an optimal balance between consumer's requirements for thermal comfort, delineated by Fanger's seven-point thermal comfort scale, and cost-efficiency, as articulated by the monetary penalty ρ A C . Specifically, the Fanger's scale spans in the discrete set of values from −3 (cold) to +3 (warm), reflecting seven (7) discrete comfort states. The thermal comfort model relies on both environmental factors \u2014 indoor air temperature, relative humidity, air velocity and mean radiant temperature (MRT) \u2014 and the physiological parameters of metabolic rate and clothing insulation. The metabolic rate quantifies the energy output of an individual, typically assuming a restful state with adjustments for transient activities. In this study, the metabolic rate is considered to be equal to 1 met, indicative of a sedentary state - the typical one for inhabitants within indoor environments. Instantaneous increases of the metabolic rate from short-duration indoor activities are excluded as they would not have any significant effect on the median hourly metabolic rate. Clothing insulation is a metric of garments' thermal insulation, with higher values indicating greater thermal resistance, thus retaining the body's thermal sensation in cooler ambient conditions. A random forest regressor [28] was employed for regression analysis with the aim of predicting the individual's clothing insulation, trained and validated on historical recordings from multiple thermal comfort studies included on ASHRAE-DB II \u2014 refined to 78,909 records after data preprocessing. In the feature selection step, the key variables for the predictive model were identified; specifically, indoor air temperature, relative humidity, mean monthly outdoor temperature, and seasonality resulted as the significant model's predictors. In tuning the Random Forest, a random search cross-validation was utilized to optimize the number of trees (N_EST) and the maximum depth of each tree (M_d). The final model configuration included 200 trees with a maximum depth of 20, ensuring a balance between model complexity and predictive power. We set the number of features considered by each tree at two (m = 2), enhancing the diversity of the model's decision-making process. The model's prediction for clothing insulation, ŷ(X), is given by the average output of these trees: (30) y ˆ ( X ) = ∑ i = 1 200 T i ( X ; Θ i , m = 2 , M d = 20 ) / 200 A linear regression model was developed to estimate the Mean Radiant Temperature (MRT) as a function of indoor air temperature. The effectiveness of the model is indicated by a high Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.889, demonstrating a strong positive correlation, and a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.791, suggesting that approximately 79.1 % of the variance in MRT can be explained by variations in indoor air temperature. Further analysis revealed a significant correlation between indoor and outdoor absolute humidity, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.96. This finding suggests a predictive link between outdoor and indoor humidity levels. The regression model's slope coefficient of 0.69 indicates that a unit change in outdoor humidity is associated with a 0.69 unit change in indoor humidity, on average. This relationship enables the use of outdoor humidity data, such as day-ahead forecasts from weather APIs, to reliably predict indoor humidity conditions. The relevance of air velocity in the indoor environment was also evaluated. However, based on the consistent near-zero values recorded in the ASHRAE-DB II dataset, air velocity was determined to have a negligible impact on indoor thermal comfort. Consequently, this variable was excluded from the model, simplifying the analysis without detracting from the model's precision in predicting thermal comfort parameters. Following the above preliminary steps, the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) model, a standard for assessing indoor thermal comfort, was adapted employing a virtual sensing approach to determine the day-ahead values for the consumer's thermal comfort. This sensor is designed to estimate the PMV based solely on the indoor air temperature. This approach effectively simplifies the PMV model, enabling it to operate as a function where indoor air temperature is the primary input (Eq (31)). The advantage of this method lies in its ability to bypass the need for extensive physical measurements traditionally required to assess each factor individually. (31) P M V − 1 ( T i n ) = f ( T i n , R H ( T i n ) , M R T ( T i n ) , I c l o ( T i n , T o u t , S ) , M E T = 1 , A V = 0 ) To predict the indoor air temperature matrix required for the optimized load scheduling, the determination of three coefficients a , β and γ is required, as emerges from an analysis of the building's thermal characteristics, while the Coefficient of Performance ( C o P ) quantifies the efficacy of the AC unit. The parameter a (Eq (32)) is the complement to β , representing the non-envelope-related thermal behavior of the system. The parameter β (Eq (33)) is a dimensionless figure indicative of the envelope's conductance to the building's thermal inertia, and parameter γ (Eq (34)) provides a measure of the system's responsiveness weighted by the C o P . (32) a = 1 − β (33) β = U × A C × Δ t (34) γ = Δ t / C × C O P Where A denotes the surface area of the building's envelope, U represents the overall heat transfer coefficient, C is the thermal capacity of the indoor air, and Δ t is the time interval for analysis. (35) θ t i n = α × θ t − 1 i n + β × θ t e x t + γ × P t A C Where θ t i n is the indoor temperature of the current timestep, θ t − 1 i n is the indoor temperature of the previous timestep, θ t e x t is the external temperature and P t A C is the power demand of the AC unit for the current timestep. 3.3 Virtual sensing framework for IAQ index 3.3.1 Dataset collection The capabilities of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) at capturing significant temporal patterns on time-series were utilized to predict the day-ahead IAQ index in residential settings with hourly granularity. A long short-term memory (LSTM) network was developed, focusing on specific key air pollutants that have a profound impact on indoor air quality assessments. The data acquisition phase commenced in February 2023, taking place within a residential setting in Athens, Greece. The process involved systematic collection of indoor environmental data using the portable smart device of Atmotube Pro. This device monitors in real-time the air temperature, relative humidity, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and particulate matters (PM1, PM2.5 and PM10). Two sensors are integrated into the Atmotube Pro to capture pollutants; the SPS30 sensor captures particle matter PM1, PM2.5, PM10 in μg/m³ with a sampling rate of 1 s and specifications presented in Table 1 and the Sensirion SGPC3 captures total volatile organic compounds (TVOC) in ppm with an output range of 0\u201360 ppm, sampling rate of 2 s and typical accuracy 15 % of the measured value. Zheng et al. have evaluated this device and have reindorsed the accuracy claims from the manufacturer [29]. From this phase, a comprehensive dataset of approximately 40,000 samples collected over a one-month period. To predict the value of the IAQ index, this study primary focuses on two pollutants; VOCs and PM2.5. VOCs, measured in in parts per million (ppm), refer to a large group of organic chemicals that can easily vaporize at room temperature. High concentration levels can cause various short and long-term health effects, from eye and respiratory irritation to more severe effects like damage to the liver, kidney, or central nervous system. PM2.5, measured in milligrams per cubic meter (mg/m³), refers to fine particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 μm or smaller. These particles are small enough to penetrate deep into the respiratory tract, potentially causing significant health problems. Furthermore, air temperature and relative humidity were incorporated into the dataset, providing the contextual environmental conditions for each measurement. Data communication between the sensed data from the physical layer and the storage infrastructure on the application layer was streamlined through an API endpoint, ensuring integration with the database. In particular, a custom webhook facilitated the asynchronous parsing and logging of captured measurements, each tied to specific timestamps, within a PostgreSQL database schema. Access to this data flow was regulated via an API key, obtained upon request from Atmotube, to authenticate and authorize the exchange of information. 3.3.2 Categorization of IAQ index values The target variable for the LSTM network is the IAQ index, which is a metric derived from the values of indoor air pollutants. In the absence of a universally accepted framework for this index, the standard from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) has been adopted. This standard delineates an index that spans in a continuous and non-dimensional range from 0 to 500, categorizing the IAQ into six (6) levels: good (0−50), moderate (51\u2013100), unhealthy for sensitive groups (101\u2013150), unhealthy (151\u2013200), very unhealthy (201\u2013300), and hazardous (300\u2013500) [30]. This classification leverages the concentrations of principal indoor air pollutants (VOCs, PM2.5) as the critical metrics in IAQ evaluation due to their considerable health implications [31]. The pollutant with the highest concentration dictates the classification level of IAQ, thus ensuring the index accurately reflects the most critical air quality concern. The categorization of VOC levels in relation to the IAQ index is not strictly defined, with a common approach to be presented in Table 2 [32]. The AQI for PM2.5 is well-established, with its categorization presented in Table 3 [32]. 3.3.3 LSTM description In the data preprocessing phase, the collected data were assigned into a Pandas dataframe. Pandas is an open-source Python library, which is extensively utilized in data analysis due to its robust data structures and advanced capabilities for handling and manipulating datasets. In the data preprocessing phase, a series of essential data cleaning tasks were executed on the dataframe to enhance the quality of forecasts. These tasks involved the removal of records with missing or null values, a crucial step to maintain data integrity. Additionally, actions performed to identify and remove outliers that exhibited significant deviations from the regular pattern of the time-series. Recognizing that irregular patterns can hold significance in time-series analysis, a hybrid approach was employed to detect and mitigate outliers. This approach combined data truncation and winsorization techniques to handle extreme values effectively. Specifically, values exceeding the 99th percentile for each feature were systematically replaced with the value at the 99th percentile. Furthermore, data points for each pollutant that fell outside the defined EPA standard's range were removed, ensuring that the dataset remained within the bounds of regulatory compliance. In all features included in the dataset, a normalization process was performed to standardize the values within the range between 0 and 1, removing any disparities stemming from varying scales between different air pollutants. To refine the dataset for the study's analysis, the data frequency adjusted to 1-min intervals. This resampling frequency was chosen as an optimal balance to achieve high accuracy while capturing short-term temporal fluctuations. The LSTM network deployed in this research is configured to analyze time-series data with hourly granularity, encompassing a comprehensive range of environmental and operational variables. This model is trained on a dataset including VOC, PM2.5, indoor air temperature, indoor relative humidity, outdoor air temperature and occupancy status. Specifically, occupancy status is a binary variable indicating human presence in the residence, which is a critical determinant for IAQ index forecasting. Delayed effects were incorporated using lags for the pollutant's value at the previous hours, and rolling moving average for the day used to summarize temporal trends. The LSTM network features an input layer comprising 64 neurons, a figure derived from empirical optimization to balance computational load with the model's capacity for capturing complex temporal relationships. A second layer of 32 neurons employed to distill the model's acuity in discerning longer-span temporal dependencies, which is critical for high-fidelity time-series forecasting. A densely connected output layer with a single neuron was employed, utilizing a linear activation function apt for continuous target prediction. This design is pivotal in transducing the sequential patterns processed by the LSTM into a discrete forecast of IAQ index values. An advanced regularization strategy was integrated within the network architecture, utilizing a dropout mechanism set at a rate of 0.2, to systematically exclude a fraction of the neurons during each training pass. This serves as a probabilistic approach to mitigate the risk of overfitting, enhancing the model's generalization capability. The training regimen was orchestrated over a span of 100 epochs, with a mini-batch size of 32 - a heuristic that offers a compromise between the noise reduction of gradient descent and the generalization benefits of stochastic methods. Early stopping, a form of regularization, was meticulously calibrated with a patience parameter of 10 epochs to preclude overtraining on the validation set. Optimization during backpropagation was conducted via the Adam algorithm, leveraging its adaptive moment estimation to dynamically adjust the learning rate, commencing at a base rate of 0.001. This optimizer is selected for its robustness in navigating the complex topology of loss landscapes typical of deep networks. Upon encountering a plateau in validation loss, the learning rate is attenuated by an order of magnitude to fine-tune convergence. For the loss computation, the MSE criterion is adopted, reflecting the average of the squares of the errors or deviations \u2014 precisely, the difference between the predicted and actual values. The dataset is apportioned into training (70 %), validation (15 %), and testing (15 %) subsets, aligning with best practices to validate the model's extrapolative strength and ensure that it remains an unbiased estimator of the underlying IAQ dynamics. In evaluating the predictive performance of the LSTM network for day-ahead forecasting, the model exhibits a considerable level of accuracy. The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) stands at an approximate 76.8, indicating a reasonable degree of predictive precision. The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) was reported at 45, suggesting that on average, the model's forecasts are within this margin of the true values for each class. The Coefficient of Determination, or R2, is calculated to be 0.78, denoting that the model accounts for 78 % of the variance in the IAQ index, a robust level of explanatory power for the variability in air quality. Additionally, the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) hovers around 15 %, providing further confirmation that the model's predictions are generally close to the observed values, with an average percentage error that supports its utility in practical scenarios. Incorporating the predictive output for the IAQ index into the optimization problem involves the operational impact of the air purifier unit. This integration process accounts for the immediate past value of the IAQ index (lag-1), the predicted IAQ index for the current time slot along with the operational intensity of the air purifier. Specifically, it considers the proportion of its nominal power at which the air purifier is functioning. This approach allows for a more dynamic and responsive adjustment of the air purifier's operation, directly based on the recent air quality measurements and the current efficacy of the unit.

This analysis underscores the potential benefits and cost-effectiveness of employing such a personalized day-ahead scheduling framework in residential settings. The baseline pattern emerges from the consumer's habitual use of time-controllable and phase-controllable loads without the influence of a structured scheduling framework, reflecting the most frequent operation instances, as documented through a comprehensive questionnaire survey conducted over the span of a month. The operation of AC and AP units exhibits a high degree of probabilistic variability throughout a day. Accurately documenting consumer's interactions with these units would necessitate an intrusive level of detail, requiring the consumer to diligently log every instance of activation along with the associated temperature settings and power levels. In response to this challenge, our approach involves aggregating the total energy consumption of these units, as determined by the optimization problem. This aggregated consumption is then allocated throughout the day, aligned with the consumer's occupancy status (see Fig. 3). The pricing structure applied in this comparative analysis accurately reflects the electricity tariffs for a typical February day in the Greek energy sector, as depicted in (Fig. 4 ) and documented by the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E). For each hour, the median value of all tariffs recorded in February was calculated and assigned to the respective hour of the day being analyzed. A statistical examination of these tariffs reveals an average day-ahead electricity price of \u20ac0.161 per kWh, accompanied by a standard deviation of \u20ac0.021, which indicates significant hourly price volatility. The minimum tariff recorded is \u20ac0.133 per kWh, likely indicative of lower demand periods, while the maximum observed tariff is \u20ac0.207 per kWh. This degree of variation in daily electricity tariffs underscores the considerable opportunity for consumers to enhance economic efficiency by adopting their energy consumption patterns in response to tariff changes. To establish the operational constraints for the AC and AP units, the consumer specified the acceptable boundary conditions for thermal comfort and the IAQ index. Specifically, the moderate level was set as the upper acceptable boundary for the IAQ index, and for thermal comfort, the range was determined to be between neutral and slightly cool. A penalty coefficient of 0.2 was applied to the objective function for both units, facilitating a balance between the cost of electricity and comfort levels. Furthermore, the vectors with the values for the day-ahead thermal comfort and indoor IAQ were forecasted to control the operation of AC and AP units, respectively, as described in Section 3. The day-ahead vector for thermal comfort was generated using the outdoor air temperature obtained from an open-access weather API endpoint. This temperature was then translated into an expected indoor air temperature by incorporating specific building thermal characteristics and considering the effects of the previous operational cycle of the AC unit, as described in (Eq (32)) - (Eq (34)). The coefficients α, β, and γ, essential for the thermal modeling within the residential context (Eq (35)), were ascertained through a review of field studies in the literature pertaining to residential energy consumption. C. Antunes et al. [33] incorporated building thermal characteristics of the residence under study into equations resulting in the following values; α equaled 0.857, indicating the proportionality factor for heat gains from external sources; β was set at 0.143, representing the heat gains from internal sources; and γ was calculated to be 2.78, reflecting the rate of heat loss to the environment. Throughout a one-month duration, the Atmotube Pro device systematically recorded levels of VOCs, PM2.5, indoor air temperature, and relative humidity. These measurements were collated to establish the training dataset for the LSTM network, which is intended to produce the day-ahead IAQ index vector. Occupancy status was also manually recorded and factored into the training dataset to enhance the predictive accuracy of the LSTM network. Furthermore, the consumer requested to define the EST and LET for each time-controllable and phase-controllable load. The time-controllable loads were scheduled as follows: the dishwasher (DW) was to operate between 01:00 and 06:00, the washing machine (WM) from 02:00 to 09:00, and the tumble dryer (TD) was set between 02:00 and 07:00. The scheduling for the phase-shiftable loads was established with specific operational windows: the electric vehicle (EV) charging was to be completed between 01:00 and 08:00, while the electric water heater (EWH) was to finish its operation cycle between 01:00 and 18:00. In the typical scheduling for electric appliances, presented in (Fig. 5 ), energy consumption peaks tend to be more dispersed throughout the day, with a pronounced increase in activity during the evening hours (18:00\u201323:00). In contrast, during the nocturnal hours from 01:00 to 07:00, there is an absence of appliance activation, thus missing the potential benefits of lower energy tariffs typically available during these off-peak hours. Moreover, a substantial gap in appliance use is observed between 09:00 and 16:00, a period coinciding with the absence of occupants from the home, which also presents a missed opportunity to capitalize on lower tariff rates. The optimal scheduling for electric appliances, as presented in (Fig. 6 ), demonstrates a strategic shift in load activation, with notable peaks in energy usage during times when the electricity price is low (e.g., 01:00 to 06:00). The overall pattern of appliance usage has been shifted to take advantage of lower energy prices during off-peak hours. The total energy cost per time slot is significantly reduced compared to the typical schedule, especially during high-price periods, suggesting that the optimization framework has successfully identified and exploited the times when it is most economical to operate these appliances. From the thermal comfort standpoint, the optimally scheduled operation of the AC unit extends for more hours relative to the baseline scenario, a calculated approach to fulfill the consumer's specified thermal comfort constraints on the optimization problem. The data suggests that consumers who are amenable to a broader range of temperatures could potentially decrease the usage hours of the AC unit, thereby realizing additional reductions in energy costs. A clear view of the AC unit's operation in relation to the indoor and outdoor temperatures is presented in (Fig. 7 ). It is noteworthy that the AC unit remains operational during traditional sleeping hours and engages preemptively even when the residence is empty. This function is strategic, ensuring that the residence achieves the desired thermal comfort by the evening and circumvents the necessity for high-power usage during periods of peak energy tariffs. The operation of the air purifier (AP) unit is enhanced in the optimized schedule, adopting a data-informed approach that aligns its activation with actual periods of detected indoor air pollution, as presented in (Fig. 8 ). Unlike the baseline scenario, where the AP unit is triggered solely during times of human presence\u2014owing to the consumer's lack of real-time awareness of indoor air quality when away or unfamiliar with off-peak tariffs\u2014the optimization framework intelligently manages the AP's operation. It maintains healthy Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) levels throughout the day, ensuring that the air quality is not compromised, while also avoiding significant energy expenditure. This demonstrates the framework's ability to provide a healthy living environment in a cost-effective manner. The analysis revealed that the daily electricity costs incurred through optimized scheduling amounted to \u20ac6.095, while the costs associated with the baseline pattern were \u20ac7.46. This delineates a notable cost reduction of approximately 18.30 % when employing the proposed optimization scheduling strategy. This strategy respects the consumer's preferences on thermal comfort, indoor air quality, and timelines. Projecting these savings across an entire year, the estimated total electricity costs for optimized scheduling approximates \u20ac2224.68 annually, compared to \u20ac2722.90 for the baseline scenario. This annual projection emphasizes the considerable financial advantages that can be realized by adopting such an optimization framework. 5 Conclusions and future work This study introduces a consumer-centric ILP framework that optimizes daily electricity costs in residential settings. This framework balances the financial goal of minimizing electricity costs with the imperative of minimal disruption to the consumer's daily routine and lifestyle, aligning with the preferred operational time-window for each controllable electric load. Crucially, it ensures the sustenance within the desired comfort levels, meticulously quantified by the metrics of thermal comfort and the IAQ index. A key novelty of this framework is the methodical incorporation of the IAQ index as an explicit constraint within the objective function of the optimization problem. This pivotal integration catalyzes the efficient operation of the AP unit, adeptly maintaining healthy indoor air conditions without forfeiting energy efficiency. Further enhancing the framework's capability is the scheduling of thermostatic loads, achieved by embedding Fanger's thermal comfort model directly into the optimization algorithm. This approach transcends controls over thermostatic loads driven by temperature or simplified thermal comfort models, strongly aligning with the consumer's need for thermally acceptable conditions within indoor environments. Both time-controllable and phase-shiftable loads were examined under the proposed optimization framework, providing a comprehensive and realistic assessment of a real-world scenario. The comparative analysis indicates a substantial reduction in daily electricity costs, achieving a 18.30 % decrease compared to a baseline scenario. This study acknowledges certain limitations that could be addressed in future work: \u2022 The current optimization problem does not take into account the integration of owned Renewable Energy Sources (RES) assets, such as solar rooftop panels, which could significantly influence both the solution of the optimization problem and the overall electricity costs. Future iterations of the model could benefit from including owned RES in the optimization algorithm, which would likely alter the energy consumption patterns and cost calculations, potentially leading to greater cost savings and promoting the use of sustainable energy sources. \u2022 The role of EVs in this study is limited to their charging requirements. However, EVs have the potential to function as energy storage systems, effectively acting as batteries that can store energy when electricity costs are low and supply energy back to the home or grid when costs are high. Incorporating this bidirectional energy flow into the optimization problem could provide additional flexibility and efficiency in energy usage, reduce costs further, and assist in balancing the grid during peak demand times. Integrating this functionality would require a more complex optimization algorithm and careful consideration of the EV's battery health and the residency's transportation needs. \u2022 The LSTM network utilized for forecasting IAQ currently considers only VOCs and PM2.5 as pollutants. A more advanced LSTM model could be developed to include a wider array of indoor air pollutants, such as PM1, PM10, and CO2. Additionally, an enhanced model could integrate data on household activities and the operation of appliances, providing insights into the correlation between these variables and pollutant levels. This would enable a more precise prediction of IAQ, leading to improved scheduling decisions and potentially healthier indoor environments. \u2022 This study does not address the potential conflicts arising from the diverse preferences of household members, each with unique lifestyle routines. The existing settings may result in interruptions or inconveniences for some individuals. Future research should consider implementing a unified inconvenience factor to quantify disruptions to daily routines, attributable to the scheduling of household loads within the proposed ILP framework. Additionally, the development of more adaptable thresholds for desired indoor air quality and thermal comfort could be explored to better accommodate the full spectrum of household preferences.
