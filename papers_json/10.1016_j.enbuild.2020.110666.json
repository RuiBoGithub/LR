Graphical abstract In this study, an artificial neural network (ANN) based real-time predictive control and optimization algorithm for a chiller based cooling system was developed and applied to an actual building to analyze its cooling energy saving effects through in-situ application and actual measurements. For this purpose, we set the cooling tower's condenser water outlet temperature and the chiller's chilled water outlet temperature as the system control variables. To evaluate the algorithm performance, we compared and analyzed the electric consumption and the COP when the chilled and condenser water temperatures were controlled conventionally and controlled based on the ANN. As a result, the ANN model's accuracy was high, with a Cv(RMSE) of 4.9%. In addition, the ANN based control algorithm's energy analysis showed that the average energy saving rate for the chiller was 24.7% and that the total average energy saving effect for the chiller and cooling towers was 7.4%. The results confirmed that the proposed MPC algorithm could contribute to improved HVAC energy efficiency in commercial buildings. Keywords Artificial neural network Model predictive control Chilled water temperature Condenser water temperature Cooling energy COP 1 Introduction With the prosperity brought about by globalization, energy consumption worldwide is rapidly increasing, and thus the need for energy continues to grow. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA)'s \u201cThe Future of Cooling\u201d report, global energy demand has increased at its fastest rate ever over the past decade as economic development and regional cooling and heating demands have increased. It is reported that the power consumption used to maintain cooling is about 20% of the total energy use of buildings worldwide [1]. Korea's building sector energy consumption accounts for about 23% of total energy consumption, and buildings account for about 45% of the electricity used in Korea [2]. According to Korea's 2017 Energy Consumption Survey, among large buildings that consume more than 2000 toe per year, the power consumption of their heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC) systems accounts for about 30% of the buildings\u2019 energy use [3]. Due to recent increases in the size and height of buildings brought about by scientific development and economic growth, the power consumption of cooling, heating and lighting to create a comfortable environment in such buildings is increasing as well [4,5]. As a consequence, efforts to develop and apply technology to reduce building energy use are very important, and, with the intensified power consumption in buildings mentioned above, there is an increasing demand for energy-saving HVAC systems. An HVAC system, which is intertwined with various data collected in buildings and has complex interrelationships, requires a great deal of data for analysis, as well as having non-linear characteristics. Accordingly, studies are increasingly using artificial intelligence (AI) to predict the performance of complex systems in buildings and to analyze and predict the energy consumed in buildings [32,33]. In Afram et al.\u2019s paper, ANN-based models of residential HVAC systems were developed, and a supervisory model predictive control (MPC) was applied. A new algorithm was implemented to train the ANNs and to select the best ANN among multiple trained ANNs. The results showed that MPC consumes more energy when compared to fixed set-points but results in lower operating costs due to its ability to store the energy in building mass during off-peak hours [6]. Afram and Janabi-Sharifi present a literature review of control methods, with an emphasis on the theory and applications of MPC for HVAC systems. They compare the performance of MPC with that of other control approaches, and the factors affecting MPC performance are elaborated using specific examples from the literature [7]. He et al. employed a data-driven approach to construct the relationship between input and output parameters using data collected from a commercial building. The computational results demonstrate that simultaneous minimization of energy and room temperature ramp rate is more beneficial than minimization of energy only [8]. In Peng et al.\u2019s study, an in-depth analysis of occupants\u2019 stochastic behavior within an office building was conducted. A demand-driven control strategy is proposed that automatically responds to occupants\u2019 energy-related behavior for reducing energy consumption and maintaining room temperature for occupants with similar performances as static cooling [9]. Platon et al. present the development of simplified, yet accurate models that predict the hourly electricity consumption of an institutional building. Measurements from a Canadian institutional facility, along with weather forecast information, were used to develop and validate this approach. Two AI techniques, artificial neural networks (ANN) and case-based reasoning (CBR), were used to develop the predictive models. The ANN models consistently outperformed the CBR models, achieving errors as low as 7.3% [10]. Yang et al. evaluated the performance of adaptive ANN models that are capable of adapting themselves to unexpected pattern changes in incoming data and can therefore be used for real-time on-line building energy prediction. Two adaptive ANN models are proposed and tested: accumulative training and sliding window training. In the case of real measurements, the sliding window technique gives better results compared with the accumulative training technique if the coefficient of variance is used as an indicator [11]. In a study by Kusiak and Xu, predictive models with controllable and uncontrollable input and output variables utilize the concept of a dynamic neural network. The model is solved with three variants of the multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm. Compared to the traditional control strategy, the proposed model produced up to 30% energy savings [12]. Thangavelu et al. developed an overall energy model of a chiller plant to capture the thermal behavior of all systems and their interactions. Their results confirmed energy savings achieved through optimized operations of up to 40% for a moderate-sized chiller plant and around 20% for a small chiller plant, consequently reducing energy costs and greenhouse gas emissions [13]. In Zhou et al.'s study, an operational parameter optimization method based on unsupervised data mining technology is proposed and verified with a large amount of field operational data from the chiller plant of a shopping mall in a subtropical area. Simulation results show that the energy consumption of the chiller plant was reduced by 11.6% and 13.3% after optimization, respectively, on the studied days in summer and winter [14]. Manjarres et al.\u2019s paper delves into the devising of a novel HVAC optimization framework, named Next24h-Energy, which consists of a two-way communication system, an enhanced database management system and a set of machine learning algorithms based on random forest (RF) regression techniques mainly focused on providing an energy-efficient predictive control of the HVAC system. As a result of the simulation, the energy reduction for the test period was estimated at 48% for heating and 39% for cooling power consumption [15]. In order to gather data for training and testing a proposed ANN model, Hosoz et al. operated an experimental counterflow cooling tower at steady-state conditions while varying the dry bulb temperature and relative humidity of the air entering the tower and the temperature of the incoming hot water along with the flow rates of the air and water streams. The model was used for predicting various performance parameters of the system [16]. Čongradac and Kulić present the optimization of chillers using ANNs and genetic algorithms. For generating chiller models, an ANN was used, trained with data collected from an actual chiller. The results of AI methods for optimizing chiller operation are verified through an actual office building model created in the simulation software EnergyPlus and through a series of experiments on an actual office building equipped with a modern integrated BMS [17]. In Nasruddin et al.\u2019s paper, the combination of an ANN and multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) is applied to optimize the two-chiller system operation in a building. MOGA successfully provided several alternative possible design variables to achieve an optimum system in terms of thermal comfort and annual energy consumption. In conclusion, the optimization that considered two objectives showed the best results regarding thermal comfort and energy consumption compared to a base case design [18]. In Granderson et al.\u2019s study, a commercially available MPC technology was implemented at four sites and evaluated over periods of 7\u201315 months. These sites represented a diversity of commercial building types, control strategies and geographies, including a courthouse, school, hospital and office. Across the cohort of evaluation sites, HVAC savings following the implementation of the optimization system were mixed, ranging from 0 to 9% [19]. Liang et al. present an auto-regressive moving average exogenous (ARMAX) model that relates the return air temperature and flow rate of an air-handling-unit (AHU) for multi-zone variable air volumes (VAVs). They also developed a MPC to minimize the energy consumption of the AHU. The optimal control could achieve over 27.8% energy savings on average as compared to the baseline control that was originally installed in the building [20]. To solve the optimal chiller loading (OCL) problem, Chang et al.\u2019s study employs the Hopfield neural network (HNN) to determine the chilled water supply temperatures. Those temperatures are used as variables to be solved for a decoupled air-conditioning system using the HNN method to overcome the defect in the Lagrangian method [21]. Ma and Wang present a model-based supervisory and optimal control strategy for central chiller plants to enhance their energy efficiency and control performance. The optimal strategy is formulated using simplified models of major components and the genetic algorithm (GA). The results showed that this strategy can save about 0.70\u20132.6% of the daily energy of the system studied compared to a reference strategy using conventional operation [22]. Seo et al.\u2019s paper proposes an optimal air supply control for an office building equipped with a double skin façade (DSF) located in a hot and humid climate. An ANN-based control was developed and tested for its effectiveness. The results showed a 10.5% cooling energy reduction from the DSF building compared to the non-DSF building with the same HVAC control. Additionally, 4.5% more savings were observed when using the ANN-based control [23]. In Yeon et al.'s study, an ANN model was applied to minimize the combined total load, consisting of lighting, cooling, and heating loads, through automatic slat angle control of venetian blinds. As a result of comparing automatic blind control via the ANN to a fixed blind slat angle, the automatic blind control via the ANN showed a 9.1% lower total load than the blind angle fixed at 50° [24]. Lee et al.'s study aimed at developing a control algorithm that could operate a conventional VAV system with optimal set-points for the AHU DAT. The results showed that the prediction accuracy between simulated and predicted outcomes turned out to have a low Cv(RMSE) value of approximately 24% [25]. As discussed thus far, research on reducing the energy consumption of buildings is actively underway, having developed various algorithms for improving the performance of HVAC systems. A number of studies related to the optimization of the performance of the HVAC system itself and the comparison of system performance through the development of various algorithms, the development of predictive control algorithms through building simulation programs, and the prediction of system performance according to the operating conditions were identified through the literature review. However, research to predict the cooling energy consumption of HVAC by applying the developed control algorithm to an HVAC system operating in an actual building and verifying the effects of the algorithm by utilizing actual data is limited. HVAC systems involve a number of devices with different characteristics, such as chillers, cooling towers, pumps, AHUs and boilers, and changes in control set-points of any one of these components can affect the energy consumption of other devices and the internal environment of the building. Therefore, in order to predict quantitative energy consumption, it is necessary to operate an HVAC and verify its performance by applying the developed algorithm to an actual building. In addition, although cooling towers and chillers take up a large portion of a building's cooling energy consumption, the predictive and control research using various operating conditions and variables related to cooling towers and chillers is insufficient. Therefore, this study addresses the control strategies of an HVAC system to compensate for the deficiencies of existing studies. By exploring a method of optimizing control set-points, a real-time prediction control and optimization algorithm of an HVAC based on MPC was developed. In addition, to accurately predict energy and further reduce energy consumption by utilizing the performance information of operating variables, the developed algorithm was applied to an actual building to analyze cooling energy savings using actual monitored data. Fig. 1 presents the overall flow chart of this study. Training data were collected by randomly changing the system control variables, chilled water and condenser water temperatures in summer 2018, and the ANN model was developed with the acquired training data. Subsequently, in summer 2019, data was collected after applying the conventional control and ANN-based control algorithm every other day to the target building. Finally, the cooling energy savings effect in each cooling load region was analyzed by comparing the power consumption and COP of the conventional control method and the ANN-based control method. 2 Research method 2.1 Platform for In-situ MPC model implementation For this study, Java was selected as the program language platform to generate the MPC model. Java is an object-oriented programming language, and it is efficient for software development because it supports distributed environments while taking advantage of C or C++. In addition, it has the advantages of user convenience by providing a simple grammar system and of increasing the usability of development contents and reducing maintenance costs via various open source frameworks. Since Java compiles Java code source and generates bytecode, it is compatible with different operating systems; hence, it is not dependent on a specific execution environment (platform). Because it is easy to operate, it has excellent automatic memory management and security [26]. 2.2 Description of the target building A 10-story office building with a Building Energy Management System (BEMS), for which it is easy to apply and collect algorithms for deriving more accurate results in predicting and controlling MPC-based HVAC real-time energy consumption was selected as the target building. Fig. 2 shows the target building selected. It is located in Gwanak-gu, Seoul, Korea, and the areas utilized in this study \u2013 A podium (2nd basement to 3rd floor), A wing (3rd to 8th floors) and B wing (3rd to 10th floors) have a floor area of 42,565 m2. The building's HVAC system consists of two absorption chillers, one turbo chiller, one cooling tower, two chilled water pumps and two condenser water pumps. Neither the building\u2019s occupancy rate nor the cooling load was high during the measurement period, so two absorption chillers were not operated and only one turbo chiller was operated. Consequently, absorption chillers were excluded from the analysis. In addition, 18 AHUs and 3 OHUs are installed in the podium, A wing and B wing to handle indoor heat loads. The building equipment specifications for the building to be analyzed are shown in Table 1 , and most of the energy consumption data of the building, such as HVAC systems, heat source systems and lighting systems, could be collected through their BEMS. The data to be collected through the BEMS in this study are summarized in Table 3 and will be described in detail in Section 4, In-situ Performance Evaluation of the Optimization Algorithm. 2.3 HVAC system overview Fig. 3 is a configuration diagram of the HVAC system of the target building. Eight AHUs and two OHUs are installed and operating on the 1st to 4th floors, and 10 AHUs and 1 OHU are installed and operated on the 5th to 10th floors. The actual heat source system installed in the target building has three chillers and cooling towers, but the past operation data collected from the BEMS of the target building showed it operated effectively with only one turbo chiller and one cooling tower. Therefore, a study using one cooling tower and one turbo chiller was conducted. To effectively reduce the electric energy consumption used by an HVAC system, it is important to select the control elements that have the greatest influence on energy consumption through correlation analysis. In our case, the chilled water temperature and the condenser water temperature were selected as control variables for the MPC control for the chiller and the cooling tower. Fig. 4 is the heat source equipment configuration diagram of the building, and the control variables chilled water and condenser water are indicated as X1 and X2 in the figure. The control range for the supply temperature of the chilled water located at X1 was set at 6 °C\u201312 °C and for the supply temperature of the condenser water located at X2 at 25 °C\u201332 °C. 2.4 Overview of ANN based machine learning An HVAC system, which has a complex relationship with the various components of the building it is in, has a more non-linear characteristic than other elements. Therefore, in this study, an ANN based machine learning algorithm was used to predict and control the future state of the system. Machine learning is a field of AI in which a machine learns and analyzes existing data to recognize objects and find a set of rules based on them. In particular, as the size of the learned data increases, the stability increases, the advantage of which is that effective prediction is possible when new data is input by dynamically responding to different variables. The core algorithm of the machine learning model used in this study is ANN. ANN is a statistical learning algorithm that mimics the working principle and learning characteristics of the nerve cells in the human brain and that is composed of input layers, hidden layers and output layers. The layer of the input vector is called the input layer, the layer where the final output value is generated is called the output layer and one or more layers located between the input layer and the output layer are called hidden layers; each layer is composed of a number of neurons. The neurons in each layer multiply the weighting factor placed on the given input value and then output the value when a critical point is passed through the activation function. These weighting factors are updated in the direction of minimizing errors through the backpropagation process and optimized through iteration. ANN is a parallel operation structure suitable for processing a large amount of data, to which it is easy to add or change information by adjusting the connection strength through learning and training. For those reasons, the study was conducted using an ANN-based machine learning technique that can flexibly respond to different variables and large-scale data processing. 3 A predictive model based on Machine learning 3.1 Data description The variables for the development of the learning model were selected by analyzing the correlation between the internal and external conditions of the building, system control variables and energy consumption. The data for the internal and external conditions of the building are the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature, the outdoor air wet-bulb temperature and the outdoor relative humidity, and the data for the system control variables are the chilled water and the condenser water temperatures, as mentioned above in Section 2.3. ANN model development was carried out using actual data from the HVAC system of the \u201cS\u201d company building located in Gwanak-gu, Seoul, Korea. The data collection period was from June 19, 2018, to July 13, 2018, and we collected 41,850 data per minute, excluding weekends. In addition, for application to the developed ANN, deletion of data during the downtime of the cooling plant system and the exclusion of abnormal data (null) values were performed to preprocess using per minute 19,582 data. Finally, 19,582 data per minute was acquired, and 1306 usable data were acquired by averaging per 15 min, which is an energy consumption evaluation standard unit. 3.2 Overview of the predictive ANN model Various modeling is implemented by decision variables of the ANN model, such as the number of hidden layers, the calculation method of weight initialization, condition of the updater and method of activation. Accordingly, the composition and learning method of each neuron were determined, and the model was optimized through hyperparameter analysis, the process of optimizing the previous four variables from which the predictive model can reach the most accurate values. The above-described variables were applied to the Coefficient of Variation of the Root Mean Squared Error [Cv(RMSE)], a statistical concept to observe the overall accuracy of the predicted values, and the optimal ANN model was selected by determining the learning model decision variable when the Cv(RMSE) value was the lowest. The Cv (RMSE) value is judged to be a reliable value when it is less than 30%, the hourly data standard presented in ASHRAE Guideline 14. Equations (1) and (2) represent the calculation formulas of the Cv(RMSE) and RMSE, respectively [27]. Last, 70% (913 data) of the 1,306 acquired data were used as training data based on random samples, and the performance of the model was examined using 30% (393 data) of the data. Fig. 5 is the overall study flow chart for the ANN model and data verification. Since this paper focuses on algorithm verification and empirical evaluation using operation data after applying the ANN model to an actual building, details on the development of the ANN model will be covered in other papers .

Performance improved as the number of hidden layers increased; 4 hidden layers produced the best performance, a Cv(RMSE) of 4.9%. With the number of hidden layers set to 4 in the ANN model, the weight initialization process for equalizing the initial values of the weights of all layers was performed. When the appropriate initial weight values are set, the performance of the model is improved, and efficient operation of the learning time is possible. The response characteristics of the model for three initialization methods, Xavier, LeCun and He initialization, were reviewed to compare and analyze the predicted performance evaluation. The Xavier initialization method showed the best prediction performance, 5.8% based on Cv(RMSE). The updater process minimizes the loss function by adjusting the weighted parameter value of the learning variable; the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method was selected for this process. The updaters Adagrad, RMSProp, AdaDelta and Adam were then compared to analyze the predicted performance of building energy consumption. For the Adam method, the Cv(RMSE) value was 5.3%, showing the most similar distribution to the actual building energy consumption. Finally, the activation function process, which determines whether data received from the input layer is transferred to the next layer, was performed. Among the activation functions, the prediction of building energy consumption performances of Sigmoid and ReLU were compared. Since the study\u2019s model has 4 hidden layers, the ReLU activation function produced a more favorable result due to the reduced value of the gradient when the Sigmoid function is used. ReLU's Cv(RMSE) result was 4.9%, and the building energy consumption by time of the ReLU function was the most similar to the actual building energy consumption. Table 2 shows the results of the optimal setting conditions for the hyperparameters, and Fig. 6 is a graph comparing the results of actual building energy consumption measurements with the results predicted by ANN. The prediction result of the building energy consumption of the ANN model selected through optimization was Cv(RMSE) 4.9%, the reliability of the model was more than 95% and the model reproducibility (R2) was 0.98. The CV(RMSE) value is considered to be a reliable value when it is below 30% of the hourly data standard based on ASHRAE Guideline 14, indicating that predictive performance shows an excellent reliability with Cv(RMSE) of 4.9%, as presented in Fig. 7. 3.4 Local optimization The minimized building energy consumption point among the operating ranges of chilled water and condenser water temperatures according to each load region was sought using the completed ANN model through the optimization process. The range of the control variable was 6 °C\u201312 °C for chilled water temperature and 25 °C\u201332 °C for condenser water temperature. When each temperature was changed by 1 °C, the temperature point at which the building energy consumption was minimized according to the expected load section was calculated and supplied to the BEMS under the set conditions of the next time-step. The load section was divided into three sections, setting the point at 9 a.m. as the minimum load section, at 5p.m. as the intermediate load section and at 1p.m. as the maximum load section. In order to derive more quantitative operating conditions, when the chilled water temperature showed a difference of more than 2 °C from the chilled water temperature of the previous time-step, a limiting condition was set so that it could only rose or fall by 1 °C. In addition, constraints were set so that at the next set-point, the condenser water temperature is operated above the outdoor air wet-bulb temperature point according to the previous operating conditions of the condenser water temperature. Once the training model was derivatized with the data set of the previous year, the actual load prediction and local optimization process were done within 20 min for generating the chiller operational set conditions for the next time step. Fig. 8 . Illustrates the application of the developed ANN with the primary cooling system. 4 In-situ performance evaluation of the optimization algorithm 4.1 Overview of the In-situ data collection This study aims to reduce the energy consumption and improve the efficiency of the chiller and cooling tower operation through optimal control of AI-based chilled water and condenser water temperatures. For this, the developed ANN-based optimization algorithm was applied to the target building, and through optimization processing, the data necessary for analysis were extracted. The data collection period for data verification applied to the HVAC system was from July 8 to September 6, 2019, and the acquired data were collected in 1-minute increments. For empirical evaluation of the reduction of building energy consumption through chilled water and condenser water temperature control, data related to the turbo chiller and cooling tower of the target building were analyzed. Table 3 is the in-situ data information related to the operation data input and output and energy consumption required for this study. From the items related to the HVAC system, input/output data and energy consumption information related to the turbo chiller and cooling tower were extracted. 4.2 Operation data arrangement Based on the collected data, prior to an analysis of the energy consumption of conventional control methods compared to ANN-based optimal control algorithms, a data re-organization was performed to acquire data more reliably. The data obtained in 1-minute increments for 24 h were collected and analyzed in 1-hour increments. In addition, the data from 9 a.m. to 4p.m., when large amounts of energy are consumed due to high loads, was organized. For this time period, data related to temperature (°C), such as outdoor temperature, chilled water temperature and condenser water temperature, and terminal differential pressure (kg/cm2) and flow rate (m3/h) were re-arranged as average hourly values. The electric consumption of the cooling tower, chiller and pump (kWh) was re-arranged as an hourly total. As a result, a total of 80 h of data was acquired when the algorithm was applied, and a total of 102 h of data was acquired when using the existing control method. 4.3 The calculation formula for hourly cooling load and COP Since COP is an essential element in data analysis, the COP data for this study were obtained using a calculation formula. To establish the COP calculation formula, the chiller's COP calculation concept was used. Equation (4) is a chiller's COP calculation concept and calculation formula through a P (Pressure) -h (Enthalpy) diagram [31]. (4) C O P ε = H e a t a b s o r b e d b y r e f r i g e r a n t f r o m e v a p o r a t o r kcal h H e a t a m o u n t o f w o r k s u p p l i e d b y t h e c o m p r e s s o r kcal h = Refrigerationeffect Compressionworkload = q e AW = h a - h c h b - h a where, q e : T h e a m o u n t o f h e a t a b s o r b e d b y 1 k g o f r e f r i g e r a n t i n t h e e v a p o r a t o r kcal kg h c = h d : R e f r i g e r a n t e n t h a l p y a t t h e i n l e t o f t h e e v a p o r a t o r kcal kg A W : T h e a m o u n t o f w o r k i n a c o m p r e s s o r k c a l k g h a : R e f r i g e r a n t e n t h a l p y a t c o m p r e s s o r i n l e t k c a l k g h b : R e f r i g e r a n t e n t h a l p y a t c o m p r e s s o r o u t l e t k c a l k g . As can be seen from the COP calculation formula and the p-h diagram in Fig. 9 , COP is calculated through the quantity of heat removal in the evaporator and the work of the compressor. Here, the role of the evaporator is to perform refrigeration and cooling that takes away heat as the liquid evaporates, and the role of the compressor is to take the evaporated refrigerant gas back to high pressure. From this point of view, COP can eventually be derived by calculating the quantity of heat to be processed by the machine and the electric consumption of the chiller. Finally, Eq. (5) of the calculated chiller COP and Equation 6 of the system COP are as follows: (5) ChillerCOP : CoolingLoad TurboChillerElectricEnergyConsumption System C O P : Cooling L o a d Total E l e c t r i c C o n s u m p t i o n o f ( C o o l i n g T o w e r 1 + C o o l i n g T o w e r 2 + T u r b o C h i l l e r ) Since the cooling load is essential for the calculation of the chiller COP, a cooling load calculation formula was established. In order to obtain the required cooling load, the difference in the chilled water temperature collected in this study and the chilled water flow rate must be obtained, and the specific heat of water and density of water must be known. The difference in the chilled water temperature and the chilled water flow rate is data that change over time, and the difference in the chilled water temperature can be obtained by using the difference between the chilled water supply temperature and the chilled water return temperature of the collected data. Since the specific heat of water and the density of water are fixed values of 4.186 J/g °C and 1000 kg/m3, respectively, the unit of cooling load was calculated by correcting the unit of turbo chiller to kWh. Equation (7) is an equation for cooling load incorporating unit conversion.

As a method for verifying the effectiveness of ANN, the electric consumption and COP of the cooling tower and the chiller when the ANN model was applied to the building and when the building was conventionally controlled (fixed chilled and condenser water temperatures) were compared. Cooling load was selected as an independent variable for model comparison, divided into sections, and energy consumption and COP for each cooling load region were compared and analyzed. An independent variable for analysis was determined based on actual measured data, and the result through a comparison of ANN based control and conventional control was confirmed. As independent variables, cooling load and outdoor air wet-bulb temperature, which greatly affect system performance, were selected. 5.1 Chiller electric consumption and COP Fig. 10 is a graph of the electric consumption of the chiller according to the chiller cooling load region. It can be seen that the chiller electric consumption increases as the cooling load increases. Additionally, in the cooling load region of about 1300 kWh or more, the electric consumption of the ANN based control and conventional control were similar to each other. The reason for showing this result is that the load section is close to 450RT (1.580 kW), which is the rated capacity of the turbo chiller, and it is considered that the ANN based control and conventional control are controlled under similar conditions. When the ANN based control was applied in a cooling load region of 1300 kWh or less, the results were divided into two categories: data similar to the electric consumption of the conventional control and improved data compared to the electric consumption of the conventional control under the same load conditions. When the overall ANN based control data was checked, the result was that the number of electric consumption data was significantly reduced compared to that of the conventional control. However, it was judged that additional review is necessary in the case of ANN based data showing similar electric energy consumption to the conventional data. Fig. 11 is a graph showing the COP of the chiller according to the change in outdoor air wet-bulb temperature, and Fig. 12 is a graph showing the COP of the chiller according to the load. Looking at the overall tendency of Fig. 9, when the ANN based control is applied, data can be divided into two categories: one where COP data is improved and one where COP data is similar to the conventional control. Concerning high cooling loads, there are cases where the conventional control and the ANN based control showed similar performance. Accordingly, it can be confirmed that the two control methods are similarly controlled in sections with a load of 1250 kWh or higher. It can also be observed that the ANN based control is divided into cases where the COP is improved and cases where the COP overlaps when compared to the conventional control in the section where the outdoor air wet-bulb temperature is 25 °C or higher. On the other hand, when the ANN based control was applied in the time period where the outdoor air wet-bulb temperature was below 25 °C and the load was lower than 1250kWh, the chiller COP data was improved. In particular, the COP of the chiller was significantly improved when the ANN based control was applied in a load section between 600 and 800 kWh. However, regardless of the conditions of load and outdoor air wet-bulb, data similar to the COP of the conventional control often occurred. If the ANN based control data shows COP similar to the conventional control data, it is judged that additional data review will be required by extending the collection period in the future. 5.2 Chiller energy savings variations according to cooling load Based on the previous data analysis, we analyzed the profile of reducing the cooling energy consumption of the ANN based chiller operation. Fig. 13 is the chiller average electric energy consumption graph for each load section, and Fig. 14 is the chiller average COP graph for each load section. In the cooling load region above 1300kWh, the ANN based control and conventional control showed similar performance due to similar control behavior with a high load; hence, a load range from 600kWh to 1300kWh was selected for analysis. When the ANN model was applied, the average electric energy saving rate in all cooling load regions was about 24.7%, and the average COP increase rate was about 28.2%, significantly reducing the electric energy consumption of the chiller over the entire cooling load region. In particular, as the load is lowered, the electric consumption of the chiller of the ANN control algorithm is further reduced, and COP is improved. This is considered to be due to the ANN algorithm being controlled in the direction of increasing the efficiency of the chiller operation while reducing the power of the compressor by setting the chilled water outlet temperature higher as the load decreased. In the condition of the lowest cooling load region, 600kWh to 700kWh, the ANN algorithm shows an electric energy savings rate of about 38.2% and a COP increase rate of about 41.6% when compared to when the ANN algorithm is not applied, the most outstanding improvement shown. This is considered to be due to the performance characteristics of the part load ratio of the chiller: the COP is significantly reduced when the part load ratio is low, the COP is maximized when the part load ratio is 50% to 60%, and the COP is slightly reduced when the part load ratio approaches 100% [30]. Therefore, with the conventional control, COP was significantly reduced in the low load section, whereas with the ANN based control, it was considered that the COP was relatively higher than the conventional control under the same load condition. 5.3 System electric consumption and COP Fig. 15 is a graph showing the system electric consumption according to the cooling load. The system electric consumption in this study indicates the sum of the electric consumption of the cooling tower and the chiller, excluding the constant pump electric consumption in most of the time period due to the constant flow system. As shown in the graph, as the cooling load increases, the electric consumption of the system also increases proportionally. In all the cooling load regions, the electric consumption profile according to the cooling load of the chiller was similar to that in Fig. 10. The data of the ANN based control were divided into two categories: data showing similar performance to the conventional control and data showing improved performance compared to the conventional control in the cooling load region below 1300 kWh. Compared to Fig. 10, which has a similar graph pattern, when the ANN based control was applied, the system\u2019s electric consumption showed lower savings than did the electric consumption of the chiller. The reason for these results is that since the cooling tower electric consumption to be analyzed takes up 36% ot the total cooling energy, the ANN control algorithm reduces the electric consumption of the chiller at the cost of increasing the cooling tower electric consumption. In the end, this is because the system was controlled in the direction of minimizing the total system electric consumption. Fig. 16 is a graph showing the system COP according to the change in outdoor air wet-bulb temperature, and Fig. 17 is a graph showing the system COP according to the cooling load. The overall graph pattern shows that when the ANN based control is applied, COP is divided into improved data and similar data compared to the conventional control. In the section where the outdoor air wet-bulb temperature is over 25 °C, it shows similar results to Figs. 9 and 10, which show the results of the chiller COP analysis. Compared to the conventional control, the ANN based control is divided into cases where the COP data is improved and where it overlaps. In addition, it can be seen that the two control methods are similarly controlled in the section where the cooling load is 1250 kWh or more. When the outdoor air wet-bulb temperature was lower than 25 °C and the load was lower than 1250kWh, the graph pattern was similar to the chiller COP graphs of Figs. 9 and 10. However, in some cases, the ANN based control data showed a similar COP to the conventional control, and the improvement of the system COP was lower than that of the chiller COP when the ANN based control was applied. The reason for this is considered to be due to, as mentioned above, the ANN control algorithm working to minimize the overall system electric consumption by reducing the electric consumption of the chiller at the cost of increasing the electric consumption of the cooling tower. 5.4 System energy savings according to cooling load Based on the data analysis of the system, the effect of reducing the cooling energy consumption of the ANN model according to the cooling load was analyzed. Fig. 18 is a system average electric energy consumption graph for each cooling load region with and without the ANN based control, and Fig. 19 is a system average COP graph for each cooling load region with and without the ANN based control. When the ANN based control is applied, it can be seen that the electric energy consumption of the system is reduced and that the COP is improved in all the cooling load regions. The average energy savings rate of the ANN based control was 5.7%, and the COP increase rate was 4.6% when compared with the conventional control at cooling loads between 800 kWh and 1100 kWh, which showed the lowest energy savings effect among all the cooling load regions. As discussed in Section 5.1, when the ANN based control was applied in a cooling load region of 1300 kWh or less, the results were divided into two categories: data similar to the electric consumption of the conventional control and data better than the electric consumption of the conventional control under the same load conditions. Under the condition of the lowest cooling load region, 600 kWh to 800 kWh, the ANN algorithm showed the most noticeable improvement, an electric energy savings rate of about 16.0% and COP increase rate of about 19.3%. However, it showed inferior results to the electric consumption reduction effect of the previously analyzed chiller (Section 5.2). The reason for this was that, as mentioned in Section 5.3, it was judged that the ANN control algorithm reduced the electric consumption of the chiller to minimize the total system electric consumption at the cost of increasing the electric consumption of the cooling tower. 6 Limitations of the present study and additional considerations to be addressed In previous studies, the comparative analysis of the energy consumption and COP of a conventional control compared to an ANN control was performed under ideal conditions by fixing all other variables except for the target control variable and by using a building simulation model. This method has the advantage that it can avoid unexpected variables other than the control variable under consideration, but it has the disadvantage that the reliability of the analysis results may be slightly reduced. Since the goal of this study is to apply and review ANN-based algorithms for real buildings, it is impossible to compare them under ideal conditions, as in previous studies. Therefore, this section examines the real-world control direction of the ANN model by presenting supplementary information describing an ANN based algorithm applied to an actual building. 6.1 Abnormal predicted value due to a lack of training data One of the areas to be supplemented later is the occurrence of abnormal predicted values due to a lack of training data. Figs. 20 and 21 represent actual data from 2018 used as training data of the ANN model in this study. Fig. 20 is a graph for predicting energy consumption when the chilled water temperature is controlled above 8 °C and shows the data distribution of the ANN algorithm when training data is sufficient. As shown in Fig. 18, since the ANN model does not need to control the chilled water temperature below 7 °C under the load condition of 1200kWh or less, most of the chilled water temperature is controlled above 8 °C to reduce energy consumption. For this reason, when the chilled water temperature is 8 °C or higher, the system\u2019s electric consumption increases proportionally as the load increases, showing a normal pattern. On the other hand, in Fig. 21, which is a graph showing the distribution of training data with chilled water temperatures less than 7 °C, the data is concentrated in a specific section, a chilled water temperature of 6 °C. For this reason, the predictive model developed with actual learning data at a 6 °C chilled water temperature shows both the normal predictive pattern in which the system\u2019s electric consumption increases as the load increases and the abnormal predictive pattern in which the system\u2019s electric consumption is constant regardless of the load. Therefore, it is judged that training data distribution in various cooling load regions is required, rather than training data concentrated in a specific cooling load region, to supplement these matters. Furthermore, as shown in Figs. 20 and 21, most of the training data used to develop the ANN model is concentrated in the cooling load region below 1300 kWh. On the other hand, a significant portion of the actual data exists in the 1300 kWh to 1600 kWh load section, but it was judged that the prediction model generated an abnormal prediction value due to the lack of training data under the same load condition. For this reason, the energy savings effect when an ANN based control is applied under high load conditions is considered insufficient. Therefore, it is considered necessary to construct training data and perform adaptive training under a wider load section and operating conditions. 6.2 Condenser water set-point temperature The condenser water temperature coming from the cooling tower is directly affected by the outdoor air wet-bulb temperature. As a result of data analysis in 2018, it was confirmed that the minimum set-point temperature of the condenser water was set at 2.5 °C higher than the outdoor air wet-bulb temperature. Therefore, the condenser water temperature limit that can be set by the ANN based control algorithm should take into account the outdoor air wet-bulb temperature. The algorithm of this study set the condenser water temperature in the range of 25 °C\u201332 °C collectively without considering the outdoor air wet-bulb temperature. However, as shown in Fig. 21, which indicates the difference between the actual outlet temperature and the set-point temperature of the condenser water according to the outdoor air wet-bulb temperature, the temperature of the condenser water produced in the cooling tower does not reach the condenser water temperature set by the ANN algorithm. As shown in Fig. 22 , as the difference between the set-point and actual outlet temperatures increases, the actual condenser water temperature does not reach the condenser water temperature set by the ANN prediction model. In particular, since the cooling tower in the present study has a high electric energy consumption, applying a minimum limit to the condenser water temperature set-point has a great influence on improving the overall system performance. Therefore, it is judged that the predicted energy consumption by the ANN model and actual energy consumption can be matched by limiting the condenser water set-point according to the outdoor air wet-bulb temperature. Fig. 23 , which shows the difference between the actual outlet and set-point temperatures of condenser water according to the cooling load of the chiller, shows a similar pattern. In the case of the conventional control, the temperature difference between the actual outlet and set-point temperatures is small. On the other hand, when the ANN based control is applied, the more the load rises above 800 kWh, the less the actual condenser water temperature reaches the set-point determined by ANN algorithm. The reason for this is that the ANN algorithm of this study, as discussed previously, sets the condenser water temperature range from 25 °C to 32 °C regardless of the outdoor air wet-bulb temperature. Finally, when a condenser water set-point temperature of ± 1 °C is considered as the allowable control range, the actual condenser water temperature below the outdoor air wet-bulb temperature of 23 °C is matching the condenser water temperature set by the ANN algorithm. On the other hand, in the region where the outdoor air wet-bulb temperature is higher than 23 °C, it can be seen that the difference in the set temperature of the condenser water increases as the outdoor air wet-bulb temperature increases. When the outdoor wet-bulb temperature is above 23 °C, the average approach temperature, which indicates the difference between the condenser water temperature supplied from the cooling tower and the outdoor air wet-bulb temperature, turned out to be 3.6 °C. Therefore, when the outdoor air wet-bulb temperature is higher than 23 °C, it should be noted that the lower limit of the condenser water set-point temperature should be the outdoor air wet-bulb temperature + 3.6 °C for reducing the occurrence of abnormal predicted values and improving the overall cooling energy efficiency. 7 Conclusion In this study, an ANN based predictive control algorithm was developed and applied to an actual building of the \u201cS\u201d company located in Seoul, Korea. The in-situ evaluation of cooling energy savings effect was performed using actual operation data after applying the ANN based predictive control algorithm in the HVAC system. For the development of the ANN model, actual data from 2018 summer was used for training the ANN model, and an optimization process was performed to improve the prediction performance of the ANN model. The accuracy of the final ANN model was Cv(RMSE) 4.9%, which ensured reliable performance. In addition, to verify the energy reduction effect when applied to a real building, the electric consumption and COP of the chiller and cooling tower were compared and analyzed with and without applying the ANN control method. A cooling load region of about 1300 kWh or more showed the same results with and without ANN control implementation, while a cooling load region of 1300 kWh or less showed significant electric consumption reduction when ANN is applied. The average energy savings rate of the chiller was 24.7%, and the average COP increase rate was 28.2%. Moreover, the total system electricity, indicating the sum of the electric consumption of the cooling tower and the chiller, was analyzed. The system analysis results showed a pattern similar to that of the chiller analysis, but the energy savings effect was lower than that of the chiller alone. The reason for this is thought to be due to the ANN control algorithm operating in the direction of minimizing the total system electric consumption by lowering the electric consumption of the chiller at the expense of increasing the electric consumption of the cooling tower. Finally, it was confirmed that the average energy savings rate of the total system is 7.4% and that the average COP increase rate is 9.4%. In the process of analyzing the energy savings effect with and without ANN application in this study, unexpected abnormal data were observed. Accordingly, the data were re-analyzed, and it was judged that the cause of the abnormal data was insufficient training data and a limited consideration of the outdoor air wet-bulb temperature when determining the condenser water temperature set-point. Therefore, it is necessary to build training data under a wide range of conditions and to set the condenser water set-point temperature lower limit to be outdoor air wet-bulb temperature + 3.6 °C in the outdoor wet-bulb temperature region above 23 °C, so that further energy savings can be achieved. In this study, we confirmed the cooling energy savings effect when an ANN based predictive control was applied to an actual building. In subsequent studies, the results of the abnormal data observed in this study will be further analyzed to reinforce the ANN model, and the optimal energy savings effect needs be analyzed. In addition, energy performance evaluation in the case of applying real-time adaptive training should be conducted. CRediT authorship contribution statement Won Hee Kang: Writing - original draft.

        "dc:description": "In this study, an artificial neural network (ANN) based real-time predictive control and optimization algorithm for a chiller based cooling system was developed and applied to an actual building to analyze its cooling energy saving effects through in-situ application and actual measurements. For this purpose, we set the cooling tower's condenser water outlet temperature and the chiller's chilled water outlet temperature as the system control variables. To evaluate the algorithm performance, we compared and analyzed the electric consumption and the COP when the chilled and condenser water temperatures were controlled conventionally and controlled based on the ANN. As a result, the ANN model's accuracy was high, with a Cv(RMSE) of 4.9%. In addition, the ANN based control algorithm's energy analysis showed that the average energy saving rate for the chiller was 24.7% and that the total average energy saving effect for the chiller and cooling towers was 7.4%. The results confirmed that the proposed MPC algorithm could contribute to improved HVAC energy efficiency in commercial buildings.",
