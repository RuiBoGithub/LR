This paper presents an optimal building energy management strategy for the demand response of multi-thermal-zone buildings in the smart electricity grid environment. The proposed method includes a machine learning model, based on a neural network, for a building heating ventilation and air conditioning system. The learned model is then applied to an optimization problem to determine the optimal management scheduling of building loads. The goal of the optimization problem is to minimize building electricity costs and reduce the overall building energy consumption during peak load hours while satisfying human comfort demand. To overcome the coupling issue between the building internal-heat-gain loads and the building heating ventilation and air conditioning system, an iterative algorithm is proposed to solve the optimization problem. In each iteration, a mixed-integer linear programming technique is used to solve a sub-optimization problem for the building internal-heat-gain loads and its results are then applied to another sub-optimization problem, solved by using a particle swarm technique, for the building heating ventilation and air conditioning system. The iterative optimization algorithm stops when convergence between the optimization for the building heating ventilation and air conditioning system and the optimization for the building internal-heat-gain loads is properly reached. EnergyPlus is used to build and simulate complex buildings with multiple-thermal zones according to real-life conditions. The simulation model is also used to test and evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed machine-learning model and the iterative optimization algorithm and the improvement of building energy management in terms of energy consumption efficiency, cost saving, and satisfaction of human comfort.

The U.S. Department of Energy predicts that building energy consumption will be over 77% of total U.S. energy consumption by 2035 [2]. With increased energy consumption from the electric power grid, building demand-side management plays a more and more important role in improving U.S. energy efficiency and security. An important demand-side management strategy is demand response (DR) which can be categorized into four main types [3\u20135]: 1) incentive-based DR, 2) DR with time-based rates, 3) market-based DR, and 4) physical-based DR. Incentive-based DR focuses on designing a special contract agreed by both end-users and electric utility companies that allows an electric utility to turn on or off the end-use facilities when needed. DR with time-based rates focuses on the control at the customer side. Market-based DR uses the electricity market day-ahead or real-time price to affect customers to rearrange their energy consumption to satisfy the grid need. Physical-based DR involves the grid side control and focuses more on rescheduling customer energy usage for emergency service. Different DR methods have been developed for the energy management of residential homes [6\u20139]. For commercial buildings, the main objective of Building Energy Management (BEM) is to minimize the energy consumption cost while assuring the safety and reliability of the building operation [10]. A day-ahead, multi-objective optimization model for the BEM under a time-based-rate DR is proposed in Ref. [11]. In Ref. [12], a multi-agent, decision-making control strategy is proposed for BEM, which focuses on improving building energy efficiency and reducing energy costs. In Ref. [13], plug-in hybrid electric vehicles are included in BEM to improve the power supply reliability and flexibility for building energy and comfort management. A model predictive control framework is proposed for a group of buildings connected to heat pumps in Ref. [14], which can achieve up to 15% reduction in energy cost in comparison to the BEM focused just on one building. In all the above references, simple mathematical house or building models are used. However, the thermal behavior of a practical building is much more complicated and can be affected by many factors, such as heat exchange among different thermal zones, solar radiation, ground heat transfer, heat loss, IHG loads, the decay of building thermal materials over time, etc. As a result, BEM could be obtained by using inaccurate building mathematical models, which would lead to inefficient BEM and/or unsatisfied human comfort. In Ref. [15], an intelligent learning strategy is proposed to learn the HVAC energy consumption model for a residential house to overcome some of the challenges presented above. Nevertheless, a commercial building is much more complicated than a residential house. Firstly, a commercial building typically has a separate boiler and chiller for heating and cooling purposes. Secondly, a commercial building usually has a multi-zone configuration and multiple thermostat control units. Thirdly, a commercial building normally has one or more VAV terminal units installed at each thermal zone. In addition, in Ref. [15], the impacts of IHG loads were not considered in learning the home HVAC energy consumption model, lighting regulation potential was not addressed, and human comfort demands were not included in formulating the optimization equations. But, all these factors are critical for developing energy management strategies for a commercial building. This paper presents a novel intelligent BEM system for multi-thermal-zone buildings considering market-based DR, which combines a building control center, building loads (including non-HVAC loads and HVAC loads), and an iterative optimization routine for the BEM development. The proposed building HVAC energy consumption model is obtained through an intelligent learning routine by using NNs. Details about the proposed learning-based NN models for HVAC loads are presented in Section 3. The proposed iterative optimization strategy optimizes different building energy loads represented by physical-based models for non-HVAC loads and learning-based NN models for HVAC loads, separately, while the interaction of the two parts is considered through an iterative approach. In each iteration, the optimization problem associated with the physical-based models is solved by using a MILP algorithm, a typical mathematical programming method suitable for solving an optimization problem with well-specified model representation having simple to moderate complexity, and the optimization problem associated with the learning-based NN models is solved by using a PSO algorithm, a typical computational optimization algorithm suitable for solving an optimization problem containing complex and highly-nonlinear models (such as NNs). Details about the proposed iterative optimization strategy are presented in Section 4. Overall, the major innovations of the paper are as follows: 1) A machine-learning-based model for the HVAC of a multi-thermal-zone building, which can better reflect and capture the actual building thermal behavior, 2) A special data preprocessing strategy by considering HVAC running mode and standby mode so as to improve machine-learning efficiency, 3) A consideration of IHG loads into the development of the HVAC learning model which increases the learned HVAC model accuracy, 4) A development of optimal BEM considering marketed-based DR, 5) A strategy to solve the optimization problem through MILP for building energy components with physical-based models (i.e., IHG loads) and through PSO for building energy components with learning-based models (i.e., HVAC system), 6) An iterative strategy to solve the coupled MILP and PSO optimization problems, 7) A consideration of human comfort demands into learning-based BEM optimization. 2 Energy and data flow within a building According to Refs. [16,17], energy flow within a building typically consists of the electric power flow and heat flow. On the other hand, smart meters and sensors are broadly deployed within in a modern building, resulting in a large amount of data flow. A conceptual view of a modern smart building is shown in Fig. 1 and models related to building power, heat, and data flows are discussed in this section, which is important for developing the proposed BEM technique. 2.1 Building power flow relation and model Electric power is consumed by the building electricity loads, such as electric appliances, plug-in loads, and HVAC system. These building loads are categorized into three types [18]: 1) fixed load (FL), 2) regulatable load (RL), and 3) deferrable load (DL). The FL is uncontrollable, such as computers, coffee machines, printers and plug-in loads. The energy of the total FL within time slot t is represented as P t F L . The DL is flexible and can be rescheduled, such as disinfection cabinets and water heaters. The energy demand of the DL is assumed to be constant in a day, which can be assigned in one time period or several time periods. The energy of the total DL can be modeled by: (1) P t D L = θ t ⋅ P D L _ t o t a l in which if the DL workload parameter θ t is close to 1, it means the DL is assigned mainly in time slot t. The RL, including building lights and HVAC systems, is the dominant load for BEM. Building lights and HVAC system account for 17.1% and 32.7% of the total U.S. building electricity energy consumption, respectively, according to Ref. [19]. The energy of the total RL can be considered as the sum of building lights and HVAC system as shown by: (2) P t R L = P t l i g h t + P t H V A C The energy of the building lighting equipment is related to light intensity and usage time and can be expressed as: (3) P t l i g h t = A t l i g h t ⋅ E t l i g h t ⋅ 10 − 3 η l i g h t ⋅ c ⋅ M The HVAC system plays a critical role in maintaining the temperature, humidity and air quality comfort of a building. A modern commercial building typically uses water instead of air to heat and cool the building through separate hydronic systems (Fig. 2 ). Typically, a boiler raises the temperature of the water which circulates around the building through a hydronic system for the purpose to heat building air in cold days; on the other hand, a chiller drops the temperature of the chilled water which circulates around the building through a separate hydronic system for the purpose to cool building air in hot days. Thus, the total energy consumption of the building boiler and chiller systems consists of the energy consumptions of boiler and heating hydronic pumps of the building heating system, and the energy consumptions of chiller compressors, cooling towers, and cooling hydronic pumps of the building cooling system [20]. In the HVAC secondary system, outdoor air is mixed with building returned air and conditioned air within an AHU (Fig. 2). The heated or cooled air is distributed through the ducting systems, conditioned again by the VAV terminal units and discharged into each zone through diffusers. The AHU uses air filters to clean the mixed air, cooling or heating coils to condition the building supply air, and supply fans to pump the heated or cooled air into the air distribution system. Additional needs of different occupants in each thermal zone are met via VAV terminal units which use reheat coils to heat or humidify the zone air and use dampers to control the discharged air flow rate. 2.2 Building heat flow relation and model The building heat flow model is complex and non-linear. Within a building, the heat transfer has three basic types: 1) convection, 2) conduction, and 3) radiation. Fig. 3 illustrates a conceptual view of the heat flow within one zone of a building. The thermal energy, from neighboring zones, outdoor, IHG loads and HVAC system, changes the temperature of the z t h zone at next time slot t + 1 which can be expressed as: (4) Δ T t , z = Q t , z H V A C + Q t , z o d + Q t , z n z + Q t , z I H G m ˙ z C in which the HVAC energy demand Q t , z H V A C is controlled by HVAC supply air mass m ˙ t , z H V A C and difference between the temperature of the cooling/heating coils T t , z c o i l and the temperature of the z t h zone T t , z as follows (5) Q t , z H V A C = m ˙ t , z H V A C ⋅ C ⋅ ( T t , z c o i l − T t , z ) Q t , z o d is the total heat energy from outdoor to the z t h zone through the exterior walls, roof and windows of the z t h zone which can be expressed as: (6) Q t , z o d = ∑ j = 1 ( T t o d − T t , z ) / R z , j The thermal energy from the neighboring zones to the z t h zone through the interior walls and floors connecting the zone can be expressed by (7) Q t , z n z = ∑ k = 1 ( T t , k − T t , z ) / R z , k The heat energy of IHG loads is determined by the internal heat load types and operation temperatures of the z t h zone, and can be expressed as [21]: (8) Q t , z I H G = ( η ⋅ P t , z ) ⋅ f u ⋅ f p ⋅ C L F t 2.3 Data flow Within a smart building, the operation and energy consumption of the building are managed and controlled via the control center as shown in Fig. 1. The control center receives measured data from the building and sends control commands to manage the building\u2019s energy consumption and operation. The measured data may include total building energy usage, the energy usage of electricity appliances such as plug-in loads and HVAC system, human comfort collected by temperature sensors, light sensors, C O 2 sensors, and humidity sensors, number of occupants in each thermal zone, outdoor temperature, and zone temperature, luminosity, humidity and indoor air quality index of each zone. For BEM considering the day-ahead electric power market, the day-ahead electricity price and weather data are achieved from the electric utility companies and national weather services. Then, the control center generates the next-day building control commands based on a BEM algorithm, such as equipment operation time, boiler/chiller temperature settings, lighting intensity, HVAC thermostat settings and so on, and sends the control data to the controlled terminals. 3 Obtaining HVAC model via intelligent learning As shown in Section 2, the building HVAC system is the most important component for BEM. One important issue is to be able to model the HVAC energy consumption properly. Due to the complexity of a commercial building, multi-zone structure, and complicated heating and cooling systems, developing building HVAC energy consumption model presents a great challenge. This section develops a novel intelligent learning strategy based on a neural network (NN) to extract building HVAC energy consumption model. 3.1 NN model database For each time interval during a day, the outdoor temperature, the temperatures of all the zones at the beginning of the time interval, the thermostat temperature settings of all the zones during the time interval, and IHG loads of all the zones are collected as the NN input data, and the corresponding HVAC energy consumption during the time interval is collected as the targeted NN output data (Table 1 ). The combination of the input and output data is formed as one sample of training data and saved in the data storage as shown in Fig. 4 . In this paper, the design objective of the NN is to be able to extract the behavior of the building HVAC system corresponding to the current or recent weather and occupant conditions. Therefore, the data storage should just hold training data in recent days, such as two weeks or a month. As a result, a queue data structure, having the first-in and first-out nature, is adopted to store the training data (Fig. 4). In other words, when new training data is added to the end of the queue, the old data at the front of the queue will be removed. Each sample consists of input data X as well as the target data y (Table 1). The NN can be represented as follows. (9) y ˆ i = f N N ( X , w , b ) where a feedforward multi-layer perceptron f N N ( ⋅ ) is employed to extract HVAC energy consumption model, w represents the network weight vector and b stands for the network bias vector. The NN consists of input layer, hidden layers and output layer. A hyperbolic tangent function is applied to each node of the network. The numbers of the nodes of three hidden layers are selected as 5, 3, and 5, respectively, in this paper. The network must be trained with data in order to extract the HVAC model. 3.2 Training NN to extract building HVAC model In order to have the updated building HVAC model corresponding to a recent weather condition, the NN is trained at the end of each day as new training data is collected and saved into the data storage. The NN is trained to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) as defined by (10) M S E = 1 n ∑ i = 1 n ( y ˆ i − y i ) 2 where n represents the total number of data samples. The NN is trained repeatedly to reduce the error between the NN estimated HVAC energy consumption y ˆ i and actual HVAC energy consumption y i . To enhance training precision and efficiency, the training data is preprocessed before being used to train the NN in terms of data normalization, equality, etc. As mentioned in Section 2, HVAC energy consumption involves the energy consumption of central plant, secondary system and distribution system. In the actual HVAC operation, there are two operating modes: running mode and standby mode. In the standby mode, only the central plant and distribution system have energy consumption and the zone temperature is only related to outdoor temperature and HVAC energy consumption changes little. In the running mode, the secondary system changes HVAC supply air flow rate to satisfy zone temperature demand. The HVAC operation index can be expressed as: (11) θ t = | T t , z − T t , z T S | = [ θ t , 1 θ t , 2 ⋯ θ t , N Z ] ≤ ς where θ t , z = T t , z − T t , z T S ( z = 1,2 , ⋯ , N Z ) is the HVAC operation index for the z t h zone and ς represents the permissible threshold of the HVAC operation index. If the HVAC operation index of at least one zone is larger than ς, the HVAC is in the running mode. Otherwise, the HVAC is in the standby mode. The procedure of each training experiment is as follows [22]: 1) read a raw sample input data X and target data y from the data storage, 2) calculate HVAC operation index θ i for the sample, 3) remove standby mode based on (11) and the procedure described above, 4) raw data preprocessing, 5) train the NN, and 6) repeat the process for other samples. The training terminates until reaching a stop criterion. Each training experiment starts with randomly generated network weights. The final network weights were selected from the experiments having the lowest MSE. Fig. 4 illustrates the conceptual view related to NN data and NN training discussed in this section. 4 Optimal building energy management The typical electricity markets include: day-ahead and real-time electricity markets. The day-ahead market lets market participants commit to buy or sell wholesale electricity one day before the operating day. The real-time market lets market participants buy or sell wholesale electricity during the course of the operating day. Typically, it is expected 80%\u201385% of the energy demand to be settled via the day-ahead market while the rest to be adjusted via the real-time market depending on the real-time load outages. BEM has great potential to contribute to the day-ahead market of electric utilities, which is the focus of this paper. The overall configuration of the DAP-based optimal BEM is shown in Fig. 5 . Basically, it involves five parts: 1) learning the energy consumption models of those loads that are highly nonlinear and complicated to model (such as HVAC), 2) MILP-based optimization for those loads that can be properly modeled, 3) PSO-based optimization of those loads whose models are obtained through NN-based learning, 4) integration of MILP- and PSO-based optimization, and 5) data collection and storage. Overall, the purpose of such a design strategy is to be able to get an optimal BEM solution quickly and efficiently. Details are discussed in this section below. 4.1 Day-ahead-based optimization formulation for BEM To be a participant of the day-ahead market, the objectives of the BEM are 1) minimizing building day-ahead energy consumption cost, and 2) satisfying the comfort requirements of building occupants, such as zone temperature, airflow, humidity, and luminosity. At the same time, various constraints should be considered for the operation and management of the building. Based on these requirements, a hierarchical optimization problem is formulated as follows. First, the aim of the BEM is to minimize the total building day-ahead energy cost C b l d while considering various penalty factors related to customers demands as shown by: (12) M i n ∑ t N T ∑ z N Z p t D A P ⋅ ( P t , z F L + P t , z D L + P t , z R L ) + ∑ t N T ∑ z N Z p t , z d p ⋅ θ t , z + ∑ t N T ∑ z N Z p t , z l p ⋅ ( E t , z l i g h t − E b e s t ) 2 + ∑ t N T ∑ z N Z p t , z t p ⋅ Δ T t , z t p where objective function consists of the following cost items: 1) total building energy cost, 2) overload penalty cost of DLs, 3) a visual discomfort penalty cost, and 4) a thermal discomfort penalty cost. The DLs overload penalty cost is used to reduce the probability of all the DLs being scheduled in one time slot. The visual discomfort penalty cost enables the optimization problem to be solved by considering visual comfort and discomfort ranges accepted by customers during high electricity price hours. The thermal discomfort penalty cost is used to add a penalty if the temperature of a zone is beyond comfort cooling/heating bound. In addition, the DL overload penalty price p t , z d p and visual penalty price p t , z l p are constant. The customers can adjust the penalty price according to their demand. For example, a larger visual penalty price means that the expected zone illuminance should be closer to the best illuminance. The customers set the upper or lower temperature bound for a zone. Δ T t , z t p is the temperature margin allowed above the upper and below the lower comfort temperature bounds, which have a larger range than the comfort cooling/heating bounds specified above. If the customers do not want the temperature margin adjustment option for a zone, the thermal penalty price could be set to infinity. The optimization problem shown by (12) is difficult to solve. To overcome the challenge, this paper proposes an iterative optimization algorithm. The main idea is to solve the optimization problems of non-HVAC system and HVAC system separately. First, non-HVAC system optimization can be linearized and solved by using the MILP method. Then, the optimal solution of the non-HVAC system is used as inputs to the HVAC system optimization problem. Second, the PSO method is used for solving the HVAC system optimization. If the result of the HVAC system energy consumption is within the constraints, the optimization solving process is stopped. Otherwise, the penalty prices, p t , z d p and p t , z l p , are increased and the process goes to the first step and repeats. The objective function of the non-HVAC optimization problem can be expressed as: (13) C n o n − H V A C = M i n ∑ t N T ∑ z N Z p t D A P ⋅ ( P t , z F L + P t , z D L + P t , z l i g h t ) + ∑ t N T ∑ z N Z p t , z d p ⋅ θ t , z + ∑ t N T ∑ z N Z p t , z l p ⋅ ( E t , z l i g h t − E b e s t ) 2 Subject to: 1) DLs assignment constraints (14) P M i n D L ≤ P t , z D L ≤ P M a x D L ∀ t , ∀ z which stands for that the energy consumption of each DL assignment should be within the energy consumption constraints. 2) Indoor visual comfort constraints (15) E M i n l i g h t ≤ ∑ n N L E t , z , n l i g h t ≤ E M a x l i g h t ∀ t , ∀ z , ∀ n (16) P M i n l i g h t ≤ P t , z l i g h t ≤ P M a x l i g h t ∀ t , ∀ z which represents the total illuminance constraints of all the lights to be within the illuminance lower and upper limits of each zone (15) and energy consumption constraints of the lighting system (16). The objective function of the HVAC optimization problem can be expressed as: (17) C H V A C = M i n ∑ t N T ∑ z N Z p t D A P ⋅ P t H V A C + ∑ t N T ∑ z N Z p t , z t p ⋅ Δ T t , z t p Subject to: 1). Total energy usage constraints of building facilities (18) P M i n t o t a l ≤ P t F L + P t D L + P t l i g h t + P t H V A C ≤ P M a x t o t a l plus (1) to (3). 2). Thermal comfort constraints (19) T z M i n − T z M a x t p ≤ T t , z ≤ T z M a x + T z M a x t p ∀ t , ∀ z (20) Δ T z M i n ≤ T t , z − T t − 1 , z ≤ Δ T z M a x ∀ t , ∀ z 3) HVAC system energy consumption constraints (21) P t H V A C = f N N ( X , w , b ) ∀ t , ∀ z (22) P M i n H V A C ≤ P t H V A C ≤ P M a x H V A C ∀ t (19) stands for the acceptable temperature constraints of Zone z. (20) denotes temperature ramping constraints of Zone z, whose purpose is to prevent sharp changes in temperature settings that may result in discomfort of building users. (21) is the HVAC energy consumption model which is learned by using NN as shown in Section 3. (22) represents the maximum and minimum energy consumption constraints of the HVAC system. 4.2 Procedure and algorithms for solving the BEM optimization problem Based on the iterative optimization strategy presented in Section 4.1, the following procedure is developed to solve the BEM optimization problem. step 1. Solve the non-HVAC optimization problem based on MILP and (13)\u2013(16). The generated outputs of DL schedule and lighting system schedule are passed to Step 2. Algorithm 1 HVAC optimization based on PSO.

Solve the HVAC optimization problem based on the PSO and (17)\u2013(22). For the PSO algorithm, it is needed to specify initial particle number N, variable dimension D, acceleration constant c 1 , c 2 , random function r 1 , r 2 , inertia weight i w , particle position T x and particle speed T v , respectively. The generated outputs of this step include zone temperatures and HVAC energy consumptions. Details of this Step are presented in Algorithm 1. step 3. Check whether the zone temperatures and HVAC capacity constraints are satisfied. If not, go to step 4). Otherwise, the converged optimal result is obtained, and the iteration stops. step 4. If temperature is unsatisfied in hour k, update penalty price for those hours as (23) { p i + 1 k , z d p = p i , k , z d p + β k , z d p ( T k , z − T z + ) p i + 1 k , z l p = p i , k , z l p + β k , z l p ( T k , z − T z + ) where β k , z d p and β k , z l p denote correction factors. Then, go to step 1. 4.3 Intelligent BEM system integration Overall, the proposed BEM integration is shown in Fig. 5. The building operation data and weather data at the present day are obtained and saved into data storage as history data. The data sequence, containing building operation data and weather data of the past two to three weeks saved in the data storage, is used to train the NN to get the NN-based HVAC system model. Then, the learned HVAC system model is applied to determine the optimal BEM control action for the building operation on the next day through the iterative optimization strategy discussed in Sections 4.1 and 4.2. By running the iterative optimization strategy, an optimal solution containing control signals for building HVAC system and other electrical appliances are generated and then sent to building control center for the next-day building operation control. On the next day, the building is operated based on the control commands generated from the iterative optimization routine. New building operation data and weather data are collected by the smart meters and sensors and then recorded into the data storage. The learning of the HVAC model may be needed if the difference between actual building operation data and predicted results is larger than a pre-specified limit. The main limitation of the proposed intelligent learning based BEM strategy is that the learning system is only used to get the actual HVAC energy consumption model of a building. Thus, an optimization technique is needed in order to generate an optimal BEM policy. This is different from some other learning-based methods presented in the literature, such as the CityLearn initiative [23], where the learning system produces BEM policy directly. Some major differences between the proposed approach and the CityLearn initiative include: 1) The proposed approach is a supervised learning approach to get the HVAC model that is then used in an optimization algorithm to generate an optimal BEM policy. The CityLearn initiative uses a reinforcement learning mechanism to determine the BEM policy directly. 2) The objective of the proposed learning-based optimization approach is to use the building as an energy storage medium and minimize the electricity cost by adjusting thermostat settings at high and low electricity prices over a day. The objective of the CityLearn initiative is to smooth out the net building energy consumption by using chillers as an energy storage medium. 3) The proposed approach focuses on the optimal BEM considering whole building energy components, including human comfort demand and other practical constraints, while the CityLearn initiative focuses on the energy management of individual building energy components, such as HVAC. 4) Our approach focuses on obtaining the optimal solution over 24-h ahead based on day-ahead electricity price while the CityLearn initiative is not a price-based approach. 5 Validation and evaluation The performance of the proposed method is validated and evaluated based on a small office building from a DOE commercial building benchmark. First, the small benchmark office building was built in the EnergyPlus and then simulated using the EnergyPlus. The generated data from the simulation was then used to train the NN to gain the HVAC model. It is necessary to point out that the NN just saw the data and did not know any information about the building model. Therefore, when the actual measured data is available from a real building, the proposed method can be applied immediately. Detailed simulation setup of the benchmark office building and result evaluation and analysis are presented in this section. 5.1 Simulation setup The simulation setup consists of three main portions as shown below: 1) Electricity Market data: The DAP data is PJM\u2019s day-ahead hourly electricity price in 2017. 2) Weather data: The building outdoor temperature, humidity and solar radiation data are based on EnergyPlus weather source. The climate zone is 5A Chicago, Illinois. 3) Building: A DOE small benchmark office building is used and shown in Fig. 6 [24]. The structural parameters of the benchmark office building are shown in Table 2, the parameters of the construction materials are listed in Table 3. For building HVAC system, the building supply fan efficiency is 0.54, fan pressure rise is 622 Pa, and the gas burner efficiency is 0.8. The single speed DX coil performance curve is defined as follow: (24) C a p T F = 0.9712 − 0.0153 ⋅ T w b + 0.00144 ⋅ T w b 2 − 0.00039 ⋅ T c − 0.0000068 ⋅ T c 2 − 0.00029 ⋅ T w b ⋅ T c (25) E I R T F = 0.2869 + 0.0239 ⋅ T w b − 0.00081 ⋅ T w b 2 + 0.0135 ⋅ T c + 0.00033 ⋅ T c 2 − 0.00048 ⋅ T w b ⋅ T c (26) P L F = 0.9095 + 0.0986 ( P L R ) − 0.0082 ( P L R ) 2 where T w b refers to the wet-bulb temperature of the cooling coil inlet air and T c refers to the dry-bulb temperature of the outdoor condenser inlet air. C a p T F in (24) represents the total cooling capacity function of the DX coil vs. temperature T w b and T c . E I R T F in (25) is the energy input ratio function. P L F in (26) denotes the equation of the partial load fraction correlation, in which P L R is the partial load ratio. We select a constant flow fraction which is 1 in this paper. 4) Optimal and learning model: The optimal and learning algorithms are all developed by using MATLAB. The NN preference cannot be larger than 0.01 and the maximum epoch is 1000. The acceleration coefficients of the PSO algorithm is c 1 = c 2 = 2.05 , the inertia weight i w is 0.7, the swarm size N is 30, and the number of iterations is 1000. 5.2 Results and analysis In the building simulation with 5-thermal zones, the proposed NN as shown in Fig. 5 generates the HVAC energy consumption model by learning the data from June, July, and August. The zone temperature, IHG load, and HVAC energy consumption data are generated by the EnergyPlus simulation model. 2231 data samples are generated, preprocessed and normalized. After removing the stand-by mode data, 1262 data samples are used for training the NN model. The proposed smart building BEM is evaluated based on testing data sets that are not used in training the initial NN. Fig. 7 shows the DAP and weather forecast for a test day, in which the test day DAP is from PJM on September 1st, 2017 and the forecasted weather data is provided by EnergyPlus weather source on the same day. We used three metrics to evaluate the learning model performance. The first one is the root mean variation between the trained NN output y ˆ i and target value y i corresponding to each training data sample as shown by (27) e r r i = ( y ˆ i − y i ) 2 where y ˆ i and y i are the inverse normalization values. The second one, CV-RMSE [25], is the normalized root-mean-square deviation between the NN estimated and targeted HVAC energy consumption as shown by. (28) C V ( R M S E ) = 1 y ¯ ∑ i = 1 n ( y i − y ˆ i ) 2 n − p × 100 % where p is the number of adjustable model parameters and y ¯ is the mean value of all the targeted values. The third one, NMBE [25], is the normalized mean bias error as shown by (29) N M B E = 1 y ¯ ∑ i = 1 n ( y i − y ˆ i ) 2 n − p × 100 % As shown in Fig. 8 (a), the actual energy consumption of the HVAC system in the blue curve is very close to and the NN estimated one in the red curve. The maximum training error, shown in Fig. 8(b), is 0.0736. The CV(RMSE) is 7.05% and NMBE is −0.08%. Fig. 9 shows the results of the lighting system power consumption of the Core-Zone 1 and Perimeter-Zone 3 using the normal operating strategy without the load control, which is named as Normal-Light, and using the MILP optimization routine discussed in Section 4, which is named as MILP-Light. The lighting systems operate in the rated power mode from 8:00 a.m. to 18:00 p.m. and in low energy consumption mode during other times. It was found that the size of a zone area, customers\u2019 illumination demand within the zone area and electricity price are the main factors to affect lighting system energy consumption. For the same illumination requirement, Zone 1 has a larger zone area and thus higher energy consumption. Furthermore, when the DAP is larger than 38.3 $/MWh from 8:00 a.m. to 21:00 p.m., the MILP-Light result shows that the lighting system energy usage is regulated to decrease the building energy consumption during that time period. The maximum regulation rate of the lighting system is 80% at 17:00 p.m. when the DAP reaches the highest value. Fig. 10 shows the comparison of DL schedules generated by using the normal operating strategy without any load shifting control and using the MILP optimization, named as Normal-DL and MILP-DL, respectively. As shown in Fig. 10, the MILP-DL result shows a shift of the DLs into four main low-DAP time periods, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm to assign the DLs into lower-price hours while the total DL assignment during the day remains the same. In Zone 1, a lower overload penalty price is used while in Zone 3 a higher overload penalty price is adopted. As a result, the optimal result of Zone 1 is more concentrated on the two lowest DAP time periods. Fig. 11 shows the thermostat settings obtained by using four different approaches: 1) conventional fixed settings at 23 o C for all zones, named as Fixed, 2) A deadbound control approach with the upper bound setting at 24 o C for cooling and the lower bound setting at 21 o C for heating during 6:00 a.m. to 21:00 p.m. which is named as Normal, 3) A deep reinforcement learning control strategy [23], named as RLC, to minimize the HVAC energy consumed from the electrical grid by managing a chilled water tank as cooling energy storage, and 4) the proposed PSO-based approach for optimal HVAC system management. It can be seen that the temperature settings using the PSO-based optimization are more fluctuated than those using Fixed, Normal and RLC techniques because the building mass is pre-cooled during low DAP hours using the PSO-based optimization. During the low DAP hours, the building HVAC system basically increases the HVAC loads to cool the temperatures of all zones. By changing supply fan and single speed DX coil energy to precool each individual zones, the algorithm shifts the HVAC energy consumption away from peak load hours. Table 4 compares the overall building energy consumption and cost with and without using the learning-based optimal building control strategy developed in Section 4 and other approaches discussed above, respectively. Compared with results without using the proposed BEM, the proposed BEM can achieve an energy saving of 12.94% for deferrable loads and lighting system, total building energy saving of 19.09%, and total cost saving of 30.72%. 6 Conclusion This paper proposes an intelligent BEM framework and system for commercial buildings consisting of multi-thermal zones. The proposed BEM system divides the building loads into fixed load, deferrable load, and regulatable load (mainly HVAC). The paper proposes an intelligent learning strategy based on an NN to extract actual building HVAC model from measured data, which can accurately reflect the performance of a real-life and complex building HVAC system. The learned HVAC model is then used to develop a learning-based, optimal BEM system, which includes a novel iterative optimization strategy to obtain optimal BEM for a building consisting of all the three types of loads. Simulation results for a 5-thermal-zone building show that the deferrable load and lighting system have more than 12.94% reschedule capacity during peak load hour, and about 30.72% total cost saving contributed by using the proposed optimization algorithm. The simulation study illustrates that the learning-based HVAC model can accurately capture the actual building HVAC energy consumption behavior and be applied to optimal DR-based BEM service.

        "dc:description": "This paper presents an optimal building energy management strategy for the demand response of multi-thermal-zone buildings in the smart electricity grid environment. The proposed method includes a machine learning model, based on a neural network, for a building heating ventilation and air conditioning system. The learned model is then applied to an optimization problem to determine the optimal management scheduling of building loads. The goal of the optimization problem is to minimize building electricity costs and reduce the overall building energy consumption during peak load hours while satisfying human comfort demand. To overcome the coupling issue between the building internal-heat-gain loads and the building heating ventilation and air conditioning system, an iterative algorithm is proposed to solve the optimization problem. In each iteration, a mixed-integer linear programming technique is used to solve a sub-optimization problem for the building internal-heat-gain loads and its results are then applied to another sub-optimization problem, solved by using a particle swarm technique, for the building heating ventilation and air conditioning system. The iterative optimization algorithm stops when convergence between the optimization for the building heating ventilation and air conditioning system and the optimization for the building internal-heat-gain loads is properly reached. EnergyPlus is used to build and simulate complex buildings with multiple-thermal zones according to real-life conditions. The simulation model is also used to test and evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed machine-learning model and the iterative optimization algorithm and the improvement of building energy management in terms of energy consumption efficiency, cost saving, and satisfaction of human comfort.",
