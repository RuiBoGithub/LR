The use of smart wireless remote water meters has become popular due to their efficiency in avoiding manual labor and automate meter reading. The current implementation of these measurement instruments often requires expensive external power sources and separate data aggregators, posing challenges for circuit safety and the goal of reducing carbon emissions in aging communities. In response, a novel wireless system has been developed to accurately measure water consumption in buildings. This system incorporates advanced machine learning techniques and utilizes the potential of water-based energy in a seamless manner. This novel methodology utilizes optical sensors to acquire visual data of water gauges and exploits machine learning techniques, specifically the AVSM model also called Advanced Visual Sensing Model (AVSM). This methodology employs a rigorous approach to achieve accurate metric determinations, thereby eliminating the necessity for additional hardware or excessive power configurations. Moreover, an integrated micro water generator has been seamlessly implemented, demonstrating the capability to effectively transfer energy to a lithium battery for the purpose of storage. This implementation guarantees consistent functionality and a significant decrease in reliance on external power supplies. The data augmentation procedure involves the stochastic manipulation of image luminance, resulting in encouraging results when used in conjunction with the AVSM model. Significantly, the dimensions of the model have been significantly decreased, while maintaining a commendable mean average precision (mAP). By leveraging this method and visual-based features, the system can contribute to overall building energy efficiency and reduce the burdens of manual meter reading while supporting CO2 emissions reduction as a feasible and cost-effective solution for building management, promoting sustainability, and advancing energy-efficient practices in old communities. This new wireless system for measuring water usage provides a practical and affordable way to enhance energy efficiency in buildings, lessen the workload of manual meter reading, and help meet carbon emissions reduction goals. As well as optimizing resource and energy use, this method also aligns with eco-friendly solutions to combat global warming and climate change.

In this particular context, there is a noticeable increase in the utilisation of diverse types of intelligent equipment facilitated by wired or wireless networks. These networks enable users to receive signals in real time and with a delay [6\u201310]. One significant benefit of incorporating wireless connectivity in industrial automation is the ability to render devices mobile, eliminating the need for restrictive cables [11\u201314]. In contemporary times, there is a noticeable decline in the availability of potable water, primarily attributed to the pervasive issue of water pollution [15\u201317]. Furthermore, the demand for water in various aspects of daily human activities has significantly contributed to this predicament. The quality standards for water vary depending on its intended purpose. The sustainable management of water resources for various purposes necessitates consideration not only of water quantity demand but also of factors such as water temperature, salinity, nutrient levels, and other pollutants [18\u201323]. Furthermore, climate change presents an additional peril to the security of water resources. This is due to the potential alterations in precipitation patterns and other climatic factors, which can substantially modify water availability in numerous geographical areas. Hence, it is imperative to implement basic preventive measures to mitigate the unnecessary depletion of clean water resources. These measures include practices such as promptly shutting off water taps after use and promptly repairing any damaged water pipes. In their publication [24], the authors thoroughly analyse the worldwide environmental effects caused by households. They reveal that a significant proportion, ranging from 50 % to 80 %, of the overall resources utilised by families, including water, are consumed. A social marketing intervention is suggested to support the conservation of vital resources, specifically water, and ensure the continued provision of essential goods and services [25\u201330]. The need to enhance water supply management is of growing significance due to the escalating demand for water [31\u201335]. Ensuring resilience against potential water scarcity in the future encompasses more than simply increasing water production to meet current demand. Equally significant is the imperative to regulate the quantity of water lost during transportation from the production site to the final consumer. The economic impact of water leakage is a significant issue in water distribution systems. Even a minor leakage can lead to the loss of a significant volume of water, potentially amounting to thousands of litres, if it goes unnoticed or unaddressed. There are numerous advantages associated with the monitoring of water usage. These include the ability to analyse trends in water consumption, identify significant increases in use that warrant further investigation (such as potential leaks), and establish reductions in water usage resulting from implementing water efficiency measures [36\u201340]. Hence, individuals increasingly recognise the necessity of developing a systematic approach to monitoring water consumption levels to mitigate the unnecessary depletion of potable water, as suggested by [41\u201345]. Based on the water monitoring system, users can quantitatively analyse the volume of water movement between two specific locations. For instance, in a scenario where a user transfers a volume of 10 L of water from one place to another, but the water flow metre at the receiving location indicates a volume of only 7 L, the user may engage in analysis and develop a hypothesis suggesting the presence of potential water leakage within the water pipe system. Users should promptly respond by inspecting the water pipe to identify potential leaks that require repair. Alternatively, they may contact maintenance personnel to address the issue and prevent unnecessary loss of potable water, thereby mitigating the associated financial burden. Furthermore, implementing water usage monitoring systems will facilitate companies in comprehending and effectively managing their consumption patterns. This will enable them to identify potential areas of wastage and implement strategies to mitigate such losses, ultimately resulting in cost savings. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have become prevalent in data collection across various applications, including but not limited to environmental monitoring, energy consumption monitoring and control, and industrial condition monitoring. In the study [46], flow rate/temperature sensors were strategically positioned at various detection points within a residential setting to gather empirical data on water consumption patterns. In contrast, researchers have developed a monitoring system specifically designed for detecting and tracking water pipe leakage in aboveground water pipelines over long distances [47\u201352]. A novel adaptive sampling strategy is proposed to minimise the quantity of data samples collected. This strategy involves transmitting data solely when there is a substantial change in parameter values. The case study employed to illustrate the effectiveness of this strategy focuses on water consumption in households [53]. Furthermore, due to the inherent inconvenience and time-consuming nature of the traditional manual metre reading process, researchers [36,54] have proposed a smart water management system or smart metre. This system aims to offer users real-time data on water consumption. However, it should be noted that the proposed solution is relatively intricate. This project has been designed to address the previously mentioned issue, explicitly focusing on monitoring water usage in residential or small-scale settings. In this system, users can monitor and quantify the volume of water consumed within a specific time frame, such as an hour or a day. The user can install a water usage monitoring system on a specific location of the water pipe, such as the water pipe in a toilet, to observe and quantify the daily amount of water consumed. If the volume of water utilised exceeds the recommended threshold and persists for an extended duration, the user may entertain the possibility that the user neglected to deactivate the water tap after usage or that there is a malfunction in the water pipe. Furthermore, a notification mechanism has been incorporated into the system. When a user within a specific location neglects to deactivate a water tap after usage and attempts to depart, the system will emit an audible signal and notify the user, prompting them to deactivate it before departure. This intervention has the potential to conserve freshwater resources and mitigate economic losses. This practice also can uphold environmental sustainability, aid in diminishing pollution and have a favorable impact on mitigating global warming caused by greenhouse gas emissions. 1.1 Background and significance of building energy efficiency and water consumption monitoring On a global scale, approximately 40 % of the world's energy is consumed by buildings. Furthermore, buildings emit about one-third of the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions [55\u201360]. Hence, it is imperative to enhance the energy efficiency of buildings to effectively address climate change and attain a state of net zero energy. Several recent studies have examined existing buildings that have addressed customer needs but have also experienced increased energy inefficiencies [61\u201365]. To enhance building performance, all stakeholders must engage in collaborative efforts. The fundamental measures for reducing energy consumption in buildings encompass mechanical interventions, such as modifying the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system and implementing natural ventilation methods for cooling. Additionally, installing automated lighting systems and upgrading the building envelope are crucial steps to be considered. It is important to note that every proposed improvement solution has its advantages and disadvantages. Therefore, assessing these measures in real-world scenarios is necessary rather than solely relying on theoretical solutions. All structures, ranging from small educational institutions to towering skyscrapers, depend on energy primarily sourced from the combustion of fossil fuels. The process of burning fossil fuels releases greenhouse gases (GHGs) into the Earth's atmosphere, thereby exacerbating the issue of climate change. Globally, the building sector exhibits the highest electricity consumption among all sectors [66\u201371]. The increasing urbanisation, especially in developing countries, leads to a proportional increase in the quantity and dimensions of buildings within urban areas. Consequently, there is a heightened demand for electricity and various other forms of energy that are extensively employed in facilities. Investigating the characteristics and composition of energy consumption in buildings is of utmost importance in formulating effective strategies for future energy utilisation and climate change mitigation. The existing body of literature provides insights into enhancing the energy performance of buildings by evaluating the benefits and drawbacks of various energy efficiency enhancement strategies, including energy conservation measures (ECMs). These examples provide evidence for the feasibility of implementing a structured system to enhance buildings' energy operations. Additionally, this framework can offer policymakers and decision-makers more effective solutions to address the issue of inadequate energy consumption in the building industry [72\u201376]. However, there is a lack of research and analysis on implementing Energy Conservation Measures (ECMs) in warmer climates. Existing literature primarily focuses on enhancing building envelopes in colder or moderate climate areas [77\u201381]. 1.1.1 Formalization of the contribution of hourly values of water consumption to the configuration of the daily profile The water supply planning process begins with establishing a comprehensive water consumption chart that outlines the various water usage levels over time. This chart consists of multiple hourly intervals, each exhibiting slight fluctuations in water consumption values. This chart serves as the foundation for optimising the water supply conditions to the network. It specifically focuses on determining the optimal timing for activating and deactivating the pumps. Hence, it is imperative to identify and emphasise the prevailing constituents of the daily water consumption patterns (WCPs) as they align with the sequential diagram of the water distribution system. Fig. 1 shows two distinct configurations of precharge circuits for high voltage batteries. These circuits employ contactors, resistors, and fuses to ensure safe charging of capacitors, with a focus on current limitation and protective switching controlled by the BMS. It is hypothesised that the hourly measurements of water consumption throughout a day should also show a strong correlation with a specific factor. Hence, the mathematical technique employed for analysing daily water consumption patterns (WCPs) was the principal component analysis (PCA). PCA can uncover significant latent factors [82] without pre-selecting input value groups. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a statistical technique used to identify a set of n components that account for the maximum amount of variance and correlation in a dataset consisting of m original random variables. To characterise daily water consumption profiles (WCPs) accurately, it is essential to consider various parameters. These parameters include the total volume of daily water consumption and its average, maximum, and minimum values over a specific observation period. Additionally, the irregularity of the WCP can be described by parameters such as dispersion and standard deviation, shape factor, maximum factor, filling factor, and irregularity factor [83]. Table 1 shows the daily water consumption for different buildings over some time. Table 2 provides a detailed breakdown of daily water consumption into usage categories for various buildings. In these tables, there are two distinct views of the data. The first table (Table 1) directly represents daily water consumption for different buildings over time. Each cell contains the volume of water consumed by the corresponding building on the given date. The second table (Table 2) provides a more detailed breakdown of daily water consumption into specific usage categories. This breakdown helps to understand how water is utilized within each building. Categories such as \u201cSanitation,\u201d \u201cCooling Systems,\u201d \u201cIrrigation,\u201d and \u201cOther Uses\u201d provide insights into various water-consuming activities. Each cell contains the volume of water consumed by the corresponding category within the specific building on the given date. Object detection is a significant and essential discipline within computer vision. Multiple machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models are utilised to improve the performance of object detection and associated tasks. Two-stage object detectors were widely adopted during previous periods and demonstrated high efficacy. Recent advancements in single-stage object detection algorithms have led to significant improvements, surpassing the performance of many two-stage object detectors. AVSM is a set of quantitative measures and evaluation methodologies used to assess the quality and performance of adaptive video streaming systems. AVSM plays a crucial role in ensuring a seamless and enjoyable user experience for viewers consuming video content over the internet. These metrics take into account various factors, including bitrate adaptation, buffering events, playback smoothness, and perceived visual quality, to provide a comprehensive view of how well a streaming system is delivering video content. By analyzing AVSM, streaming service providers and content delivery networks can fine-tune their algorithms and infrastructure to optimize video streaming quality and minimize disruptions, ultimately enhancing user satisfaction and engagement with online video content. This section provides a concise overview of deep learning and computer vision, specifically focusing on object detection. It covers relevant terminologies, challenges, stages involved in implementing object detection algorithms, the historical development of various object detection algorithms, commonly used datasets, and the significant contributions of the study. Deep Learning (DL) emerged as a novel approach in the early 2000 s following the rise in popularity of Support Vector Machines (SVM), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) [84\u201386], and other neural networks with fewer layers [87\u201392]. Numerous researchers have classified it as a distinct subset within the Machine Learning (ML) field, which is recognised as a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) [93\u2013101]. During its early stages, deep learning did not receive significant attention primarily because of challenges related to scalability and other influential factors, such as the requirement for substantial computational resources. Since 2006, there has been a significant shift in popularity towards this particular algorithm compared to other machine learning algorithms. This can be attributed to two primary factors: (i) the increased availability of large volumes of data for processing and (ii) the increased availability of advanced computational resources. The success stories of deep learning in various domains include weather forecasting [102], stock market prediction [103], speech recognition [104], object detection [105], character recognition [106], intrusion detection [107], automatic landslide detection [108], time series prediction [109], text classification [110], gene expression [111], micro-blogs [112], biological data handling [113], unstructured text data mining with fault classification [114], video processing such as caption generation [115], and many more [116,117]. Computer vision is a highly influential and adaptable discipline in the contemporary era, with numerous researchers conducting extensive investigations. Computer vision is a field of study that involves training machines to comprehend, manipulate, and evaluate visual information at a sophisticated level. Computer vision encompasses various subfields that focus on visual perception and analysis aspects. These subfields include scene or object recognition, object detection, video tracking, object segmentation, pose and motion estimation, scene modelling, and image restoration [108,118\u2013123]. This study primarily examines the field of object detection, including its subfields of object localization and segmentation. These tasks are widely recognized as crucial and widely studied within computer vision. Standard deep learning models that can be applied to various computer vision tasks include Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Deep Belief Networks (DBNs), Deep Boltzmann Machines (DBMs), Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), and Stacked Autoencoders [124\u2013130]. Image classification refers to categorising an image or an object within an image into specific predetermined categories. This problem is typically addressed using supervised machine learning or deep learning algorithms, in which a model is trained on a substantial dataset that has been accurately labelled. Several machine learning models commonly used for this task are Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, and K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) [124,131\u2013135]. In deep learning, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and their subsequent architectural iterations and variations have emerged as the predominant models for image classification and related tasks. In addition to established machine learning and deep learning models, alternative approaches such as Fuzzy logic and Genetic algorithms are also utilised for the functions above [136\u2013141]. Object localization is a computational task that involves accurately identifying and determining the precise position of one or more objects within an image or frame. This is achieved by enclosing the object(s) with a rectangular box, commonly referred to as a bounding box. Image segmentation is a fundamental procedure that involves dividing an image into distinct segments. Each segment can potentially encompass an entire object or a specific portion of an object. Image segmentation is a widely used technique in computer vision that aims to accurately identify and delineate the boundaries of things, lines, and curves within an image. In general, pixels within a segment exhibit shared attributes, including but not limited to intensity and texture. The primary objective of image segmentation is to transform an image into a coherent and interpretable representation. Additionally, object detection can be conceptualized as a fusion of classification, localization, and segmentation techniques. The objective is to accurately categorize and effectively determine the precise location of individual or multiple objects within an image. This is typically achieved using supervised algorithms, leveraging a substantial dataset with labelled examples. 1.2 Motivation for using wireless water sensors and AVSM in data analysis Water level monitoring plays a crucial role in hydrological monitoring. The continuous and dependable monitoring of water levels is essential in ensuring water safety, managing water resources, and protecting water environments and ecosystems. Several methods for measuring water levels include manual reading, automatic water level measurement, and optical fibre-based liquid level measurement technology [142\u2013146]. Visual inspection is employed to observe the water gauge without any additional instruments. Nevertheless, this method suffers from the limited frequency of readings and is prone to a certain level of subjective interpretation. The observation angle significantly influences the measurements, and the level of uncertainty is amplified in challenging environmental conditions. Advancements in electronic sensor technology facilitate the acquisition of water level data using automatic water level gauges. Various types of mechanical water level gauges currently available in the market include float, pressure, ultrasonic, radar, capacitive, and others. Paul measured the water level using the Garmin radar sensor [147\u2013152]. The sensor exhibits high accuracy when the tilt angle does not exceed 40°. For measurement distances below 10 m, the accuracy is within 1 cm, while the maximum detectable range spans from 30 m to 35 m. Li (3) obtained water level measurements using an ultra-small pressure sensor, which was found to have an error range of 1\u20132 cm. Water level gauges possess certain advantages. However, their corresponding disadvantages are more perceptible. The existing water level sensors exhibit limitations, including limited lifespan, reduced measurement precision, and inconsistent operational stability. Intricate mechanisms characterise the functioning of these entities and entail significant expenses for upkeep. The accuracy of these devices is susceptible to environmental factors, limiting their ability to provide continuous monitoring for a full 24-hour period. Numerous water level monitoring sites have implemented video surveillance systems with vertical water gauges. The users have solely employed video real-time viewing, recording, and playback functionalities, without fully capitalising on the potential of video remote monitoring. While manual observation remains necessary for water level data collection, it poses challenges regarding resource allocation and analysis due to its reliance on human labour and material resources. Fig. 2 shows a schematic diagram of a reed switch pulse output mechanism juxtaposed with an image of a meter displaying cubic feet readings. The image on the left displays a simplified diagram of a reed switch mechanism. It consists of a pulse output leading to a reed contact which is affected by a magnet. When the magnet comes close to the reed contact, it causes the two wires (Wire 1 and Wire 2) to connect, completing the circuit. The image on the right shows a close-up of a gas or water meter, with dials indicating usage in cubic feet. There's a highlighted or circled area, pointing out a particular feature or part of the meter. Using wireless water sensors and the AVSM model in data analysis can offer numerous benefits in various applications. Let's break down the motivations for using these technologies: Wireless water Sensors Real-time Monitoring: Wireless water sensors enable real-time monitoring of water quality and environmental parameters, such as temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, and contaminants. This is crucial for identifying sudden changes or anomalies indicating pollution events, leaks, or unsafe conditions. Remote Accessibility: Wireless sensors can be deployed in remote or difficult-to-reach locations, allowing researchers and environmental professionals to collect data without physically accessing those areas. This reduces operational costs and risks associated with manual data collection. Data Accuracy: These sensors provide accurate and reliable measurements, reducing human error and inconsistencies that can occur with manual measurements. Early Detection: Wireless sensors can detect problems or potential hazards early, enabling timely intervention and preventing more serious issues from developing. Environmental Monitoring: They are essential for monitoring the health of ecosystems, bodies of water, and industrial processes, helping to ensure compliance with environmental regulations. AVSM Model Object Detection: The YOLO model is a highly advanced object detection model. AVSM also called (AVSM) is a progressive algorithmic enhancement that provides real-time and high-precision identification of objects within both static images and dynamic video streams. Efficiency: AVSM is known for its efficiency in terms of both speed and accuracy. This makes it suitable for real-time applications where timely decisions are critical. Water Quality Monitoring: AVSM can analyze imagery from water bodies captured by cameras or drones. It can detect and track objects like pollutants, debris, or invasive species, aiding in water quality assessment. Infrastructure Inspection: In scenarios like water distribution systems or dams, AVSM can help detect structural issues, leaks, or anomalies in real-time by analyzing images or videos. Automated Analysis: AVSM's ability to detect multiple objects in a single pass makes it helpful in automating the analysis of large datasets. It reduces the need for manual inspection and speeds up decision-making processes. Integration with Sensors: Combining AVSM with wireless water sensors allows for a multi-modal approach to data analysis. The sensors provide quantitative data, while AVSM adds a visual understanding of the situation. Fig. 3 shows the interconnection of various components, primarily between a Raspberry Pi and an Arduino Shield, using different communication protocols. The diagram showcases a connection between a Raspberry Pi and an Arduino Shield. Components like the ATmega328p microcontroller and various communication buses (SPI, I²C) facilitate data processing and transfer. Peripheral devices, such as the magnetometer and real-time clock, act as sensors in this system. The diagram depicts a hardware setup that can interface with wireless sensors through components like the magnetometer. Data from these sensors can be processed and transferred using the Raspberry Pi and Arduino Shield's communication buses. 2 Region-based object detection of remote sensing images Currently, two distinct categories of remote sensing image object detection methods based on deep learning can be classified based on whether they require region proposals. The task of detecting objects in remote sensing images is accomplished through regression-based methods. These methods involve classifying and estimating the location of candidate object regions by extracting relevant features from multiple candidate regions. Notable examples of such methods include Faster R-CNN [153], Mask R-CNN [154], and Cascade R-CNN [155]. Many scholars in recent years have proposed methods for small object detection in remote sensing images. These methods are based on various approaches and techniques. Dong et al. [156] introduced a novel approach called Sig-NMS to address the issue of missed detections of small objects in the region proposal network (RPN). This approach replaces the conventional non-maximum suppression (NMS) technique used in RPN. The authors demonstrated that Sig-NMS effectively improves detection performance. In their study, Zheng et al. [157] introduced a novel approach called the multiscale attention feature pyramid network (MAFPN). This approach incorporates a feature pyramid into the attention module, generating a feature map that is subsequently used as input for the region proposal network (RPN). By doing so, the MAFPN significantly enhances object detection performance, specifically for small-scale remote sensing images. Nevertheless, there is a need to improve the computational efficiency of the region proposal network. In their study, Yao et al. [158] proposed a novel approach called the multiresolution feature extraction network (MFE). This approach is based on the Faster R-CNN network and aims to mitigate the semantic disparity between different scales by enhancing the features at each scale with varying resolutions. However, it should be noted that this method may not be optimal for detecting small objects in the presence of significant background noise interference. Li et al. [159] introduced a novel approach for detecting targets in remote sensing images with limited samples in their study. This method, known as the Local Features-Convolutional Neural Network (LF-CNN), combines local features and a convolutional neural network to accurately identify small numbers of ground object targets that are unevenly distributed. The LF-CNN method demonstrates superior capability in integrating local features of ground object samples, leading to enhanced accuracy in target identification and detection within limited examples of remote sensing images, surpassing the performance of conventional target detection methods. Nevertheless, there exist certain limitations in terms of temporal constraints and intricacy. This study proposes an innovative wireless water consumption sensing system for buildings, integrating machine learning and water energy collection. This system employs visual sensors to capture water meter images, utilizing the lightweight AVSM model for precise data recognition, eliminating the need for extra hardware or costly installations. A 12 V micro water generator is incorporated to achieve self-sustainability, efficiently transferring energy to a lithium battery. This mechanism curtails reliance on external power, enhancing eco-friendliness and cost-effectiveness. A data augmentation technique is implemented to address sparse training data, randomly adjusting image brightness to expand the dataset. The lightweight AVSM model's size is reduced by 87.1 % while maintaining a high mean average precision of 92.3 %, as demonstrated through extensive experimentation. The developed system ensures water consumption monitoring accuracy and extends to other meter reading tasks, showcasing its versatility. Combining machine learning and visual-based features, the system contributes to building energy efficiency and reduces manual reading burdens, aligning with emission reduction goals. To conclude, the proposed wireless water consumption sensing system offers a practical, cost-effective solution for building management, promoting sustainability and energy-efficient practices in aging communities. Integrating machine learning and self-power stability lays the foundation for a greener, smarter approach to water metering, addressing current challenges and fostering future advancements in the field. 2.1 Previous studies integrating wireless sensors and deep learning models In a study performed by Li et al. [160], a novel approach was presented for partitioning a deep neural network into distinct layers to extract distributed data and allocate it to the sensors. Consequently, the distributed data mining compute units of (WSNs) collectively bear a significant portion of the computational load involved in the fusion centre calculation. The processing is performed using (DNN) techniques, as it has been observed that the energy consumption associated with transmitting processed data is lower compared to transmitting raw data. A scenario for error detection has been devised to validate this method. The experimental findings indicate a detection rate of 99 %. Additionally, the data mining process in the WSN accounts for 64.06 % of the overall data usage while simultaneously contributing to 58.31 % of the total power consumption. By employing machine learning methodologies by Pandey [161], it is not necessary to engage in excessive redesign. Automated learning technologies offer practical solutions for optimizing resource utilization, thereby improving the efficiency and lifespan of sensor networks. Extensive scholarly literature has examined and analyzed machine learning methodologies to resolve the node localization challenge within WSNs. The strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm proposed in the literature are systematically analyzed and evaluated for the problem under investigation. The findings are presented in a comparative table, which aims to guide future designers in developing machine-learning solutions suitable for addressing the identified challenges in Arabization. Lei et al. [162] discussed the development of SSAE Deep Distributed Learning Mobile Projects within sink nodes and WSN control nodes. The SSAE network architecture and model parameters were optimised through training. The simulation investigates the impact of spatiotemporal data on the architecture of the SSAE network. Using Hash + LRU and Betw + LRU temporary strategies, combined with caching and BPNN algorithms, is being considered to enhance system performance and efficiency. Zhang et al. [163] proposed advanced machine learning methods as a potential approach to address the challenges posed by the growing amount of data and the increasing reliance on algorithms in various applications. The recent advancements in deep learning have demonstrated significant achievements in addressing challenges within this domain. A thorough investigation has assessed the compatibility and interaction between deep learning techniques and research in mobile and wireless networks. Numerous technologies and platforms enable the efficient distribution of deep learning algorithms on mobile systems. This study focuses on conducting comprehensive research on mobile and wireless networks, specifically exploring the application of deep learning techniques in various domains. Additionally, it examines the challenges and strategies involved in adapting deep learning algorithms to the unique environment of mobile devices. Furthermore, this inquiry seeks to identify the existing challenges and potential future directions for research in a given field. Fig. 4 shows the structure of AVSM. 3 Wireless water sensors 3.1 Types of wireless water sensors used in the study Wireless water sensors are devices designed to monitor various aspects of water quality and conditions remotely without physical connections (Table 3 ).

These sensors can vary in technology, accuracy, communication range, and power requirements. The choice of sensor type depends on the specific monitoring goals and environmental conditions of the study or application. 3.2 Exploring Modern Power Generation and Energy Storage Techniques Wireless water sensors, crucial for data transmission, rely on diverse power generation and storage methods for sustained operation. The first is battery power, encompassing disposable or rechargeable batteries tailored to sensor power requirements and expected lifespan, as seen in Table 4 . Solar panels harness sunlight to directly power sensors or charge internal batteries, a boon for outdoor and sunlit settings. Energy harvesting extracts ambient energy, like vibrations or temperature gradients, converting it into electricity through piezoelectric, thermoelectric, or kinetic mechanisms. Inductive coupling employs electromagnetic fields for wireless power transfer between a charging station and sensor, apt for applications with impractical connections. Similarly, hydroelectric and wind power convert water flow or wind energy into electricity, which is beneficial in water-rich or windy locales. Fuel cells, albeit complex, offer prolonged power via chemical reactions, while supercapacitors provide rapid energy release for intermittent requirements. Lastly, battery swapping/replacement ensures continuous operation by replacing depleted batteries with charged ones. These varied methods cater to distinct scenarios, driving the reliability and versatility of wireless water sensors across diverse environments. An appropriate power generation and storage method for wireless water sensors hinges on power consumption, location, operational needs, and available resources. Often, a blend of techniques ensures consistent performance across diverse environments. When considering battery power, several aspects come into play.

The sensor's power requirements, including data collection, processing, and wireless transmission, guide battery capacity and voltage choice. Efficient power management techniques extend battery life, such as sleep modes and transmission interval adjustments. The decision between rechargeable and disposable batteries depends on recharging ease and infrastructure availability. Monitoring battery levels and proactive replacement or recharging are vital for continuous operation. Battery size, form factor, and environmental considerations further influence wireless water sensors' overall design, efficiency, and longevity. A comprehensive understanding of these factors guides the optimal battery power selection, ensuring reliable and sustained functionality in various conditions. Battery Safety Precautions: Safety is paramount when using batteries, as mishandling can lead to leaks, overheating, or even explosions. Following manufacturer guidelines for storage, usage, and disposal of batteries is critical to ensure the safety of the sensor and the surrounding environment. 3.2.1 Unveiling the Potential of Micro-Hydro Generators Micro-hydro generators present an innovative solution for powering wireless water sensors, particularly in regions abundant with flowing water sources. These generators harness the kinetic energy inherent in moving water to generate mechanical energy, converted into electrical power through a generator. This process involves submerging a rotor with blades into the water, allowing the flowing water to set it in motion. The mechanical energy from the rotor's rotation is then transmitted to a generator, which converts it into a usable electrical output. A microhydro power plant is a power generation system that operates on a small scale and harnesses the energy of flowing water, specifically hydropower. This system utilizes the force generated by water in irrigation canals, rivers, or natural waterfalls, taking advantage of the elevation and water discharge to generate electricity. The plant comprises three primary components: \u2022 Water, which serves as an energy source. \u2022 A turbine, which is connected to a generator. \u2022 A generator, which produces electrical energy. To achieve optimal functionality, a micro-hydro generator necessitates a well-designed system that includes a mechanism for regulating the rotation of the generator. This regulation is crucial for maintaining stable voltage and frequency output. However, the use of uncertain loads will change the voltage and frequency, so it is necessary to regulate the load by increasing the complement load, the load on the consumer, and the complement load equals the generator's nominal capacity. This results in a constant generator rotation to stabilize the resulting voltage and frequency. This paper will integrate a prototype micro hydro generator with complement load as a voltage and frequency stabilizer by utilizing the front-loading washing machine motor LG direct drive as a generator. The generator's voltage, frequency and rotation parameters will be monitored remotely using the ESP 8266 module and designed using Labview software. In a study by Anaza et al. [165], an overview made a review of micro hydropower plants. The study was carried out on the essential components needed to make micro-hydro power plants, such as generators and turbines and the possibility of conversion. In a study by Fortaleza [166], an IoT-based Pico-Hydro Power Generation System using Pelton Turbine made a monitoring system using low-cost microcontrollers and wireless networks for micro-hydro plants that were difficult to reach in their supervision. An IoTbased monitoring system is expected to monitor difficult-to-reach plants' conditions easily. Gozon et al. [167] introduced an Induction Generator Control and Monitoring System for Micro-hydro Power Plants that made control of induction generators and monitoring systems. The monitoring system was made using a microcontroller with an LCD. In another study [168], the Design and Testing of Permanent Magnet Generator 1 Phase based on an Induction Motor tested the low-round generator as the leading energy producer in micro-generator generation. The rotor used is a rotor with a permanent magnet so that this generator can be operated at low speed. In the study \u201cDesign and Construction of a Mini Hydropower Plant with a Propeller Turbine\u201d [169], the researcher successfully developed a small-scale power generation facility utilising a propeller turbine. The propeller turbine was chosen due to its uncomplicated structure and ease of fabrication. The architectural components within the study are illustrated in Fig. 5 . The Speed Governing System in a hydro-electric power plant is initiated by the \u201cReference Power\u201d and \u201cFrequency Setting\u201d inputs. These inputs inform the \u201cGovernor\u201d on how to adjust the speed for optimal performance. In response, the \u201cGovernor\u201d interfaces with the \u201cControl Mechanism\u201d, which in turn operates the \u201cGate\u201d. By regulating the \u201cGate\u201d, the flow of water to the \u201cTurbine-Penstock\u201d is controlled. This flow subsequently drives the \u201cGenerator\u201d, leading to the generation of the \u201cPower Output\u201d. Additionally, the system is equipped with a \u201cPower Transducer\u201d and a \u201cFrequency Transducer\u201d to monitor and manage the power and frequency metrics, ensuring efficient energy production and delivery. 3.2.2 Fundamentals of Lithium Batteries Lithium batteries exhibit superior energy density, operational lifespan, and self-discharge rates compared to alternative battery technologies. Here's a detailed explanation of lithium batteries: Lithium batteries, encompassing lithium-ion (Li-ion) and lithium polymer (LiPo) variants, find widespread use in consumer electronics and wireless water sensors. Li-ion batteries leverage lithium ion migration for charging and discharging, balancing energy density, lifespan, and performance. On the other hand, LiPo batteries, with gel-like electrolytes and flexible packaging, offer higher energy density. Their significant energy density makes lithium batteries ideal for space and weight-limited applications like wireless water sensors. While boasting rechargeability, low self-discharge rates, and extended lifespan, lithium batteries require careful charging, discharging, and safety considerations due to potential thermal runaway risks. These attributes, tailored to the power needs of wireless water sensors, position lithium batteries as a reliable power source for sustained operation and data communication in this context. The chemical properties of common lithium battery types are seen in Table 5 . Lithium batteries are an indispensable energy source for wireless water sensors, mainly aquatic monitoring. Their exceptional energy density empowers these sensors to operate tirelessly over extended periods, offering a distinct advantage in environments where frequent battery changes are inconvenient or impractical. This characteristic is precious for water sensors positioned in remote or hard-to-access areas, ensuring consistent data collection without disruptions. Incorporating these aspects holistically, using lithium batteries in wireless water sensors is a testament to their adaptability and efficacy. By leveraging their high energy density, compact design, rechargeability, and considering environmental factors, these batteries empower sensors to thrive in aquatic settings. They enable continuous data collection, facilitate eco-friendly practices through recharging, and contribute to informed decision-making in environmental, agricultural, and industrial water management applications. 1. Diffusion Equation: The diffusion equation describes how ions move within the electrode materials during charge and discharge: (1) ∂ c ∂ t = D · ∂ 2 c ∂ x 2 where c is the concentration of ions, t is time, D is the diffusion coefficient, and x is distance. 2. Butler-Volmer Equation: The Butler-Volmer equation models the kinetics of electrochemical reactions at the electrode\u2013electrolyte interface: (2) i = i 0 exp α a F RT η - exp - α c F RT η Where i is the current, i 0 is the exchange current density, α a and α c are the anodic and cathodic transfer coefficients, F is Faraday's constant, R is the gas constant, T is temperature, and η is the overpotential. 3. Peukert's Law for Energy: Peukert's law can also be applied to energy at different discharge rates: (3) E discharge = E rating · t discharge t rating k Where E discharge is the discharged energy, E rating is the rated energy, t discharge is the discharge time, t rating is the rated discharge time, and k is a constant. 4. Peukert's Exponent: The Peukert exponent ( k ) is a parameter that characterizes the rate capability of a battery: (4) k = l n ( 1 - Efficiency) l n (Discharge Time)- l n (Rated Discharge Time) 5. Theoretical Capacity: 6. The theoretical capacity Q t h of a battery is determined by the number of moles of electrons transferred in the reaction: 7. Q t h = n · F Faraday Efficiency 8. Where n is the number of moles of electrons and Faraday Efficiency is the efficiency of converting moles of electrons into usable capacity. These equations and formulas are more complex and may involve additional parameters. They provide a deeper understanding of lithium batteries' underlying processes and characteristics. Environmental parameters monitored by wireless water sensors are shown in Table 6 . Table 7 summarizes the key aspects of lithium batteries in the context of wireless water sensors. 3.3 Wireless visual meter reading node The node includes several essential components, including an image sensor, a local processor, a storage facility, a battery or alternative energy source, lighting, and a wireless transceiver. Wireless Visual Sensor Networks (WVSNs) present a distinct and heightened level of complexity compared to other sensor networks. This is primarily because WVSNs process two-dimensional data, whereas conventional sensor networks typically generate scalar data. The extensive volume of data handled by WVSNs necessitates imposing more rigorous demands on power consumption, bandwidth allocation, and processing capabilities. Energy consumption and bandwidth limitations are significant factors in WVSNs due to the reliance on battery-powered nodes and data transmission over a constrained wireless bandwidth. Hence, it is imperative to carry out local processing to mitigate the volume of data. Conducting extensive processing and data collection over a prolonged duration requires substantial energy. The researchers are actively engaged in reducing the network's energy consumption to maximise the lifespan of the WVSNs. To achieve real-time performance, it is imperative for smart cameras to engage in local processing on the sensor node, followed by intelligent decision-making, and subsequently transmit the data over a wireless link. The primary objective is to develop a smart system conscious of power consumption. This system should be capable of executing the required computations internally, possess ample storage capacity, and meet the system's energy demands and transmission bandwidth. Extracting robust and reliable information is imperative in a wireless vision sensor network. Achieving this goal necessitates the development of robust algorithms for image processing. To gain a comprehensive understanding, it is advisable to construct and validate the algorithm abstractly. All the performance parameters have been met, the algorithm can be implemented on the designated software and hardware platforms. Smart camera networks have the potential to be readily deployed for numerous applications that necessitate wireless solutions. In applications that require installing a wireless sensor system, it is imperative to ensure adequate energy resources, processing capacity for local data processing, and sufficient bandwidth for wireless data transmission. Smart sensors, or a network of sensors, facilitate the acquisition and control of real-time data in industrial applications. The implementation of wireless technology provides several advantages, including decreased expenses related to system and infrastructure, reduced operating costs, simplified upgrade processes, and enhanced physical mobility of the device [171\u2013174]. Wireless Sensor Networks are wireless ad hoc networks where sensor nodes gather, analyse, and transmit data obtained from the physical environment to an external base station (BS). This enables the monitoring and control of different physical parameters [175\u2013178]. The base station (BS) receives and processes data from sensor nodes, utilising an unlimited energy source. Clustering algorithms can be classified into two distinct categories: distributed and centralised [179\u2013182]. The centralised approach assumes that each node in the network possesses knowledge about the information related to all other nodes. The problem is formulated as a graph partitioning problem, incorporating specific constraints that result in its classification as NP-hard. The central node employs a partitioning algorithm to determine clusters in the given data. Nevertheless, the primary limitations associated with this classification are attributed to the supplementary expenses incurred in transmitting the information of network nodes and the duration necessary to resolve an optimisation problem. Heinzelman et al. [183] present a centralised variant of the Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) algorithm in their study. This variant aims to enhance the clustering process by distributing cluster head nodes more evenly across the network. In this experimental procedure, every individual node transmits data about its present position and energy level to the base station (BS) node. The BS node then calculates the average energy level of the nodes. Nodes with energy levels lower than this average are disqualified from becoming cluster head nodes for the ongoing round. The remaining nodes are considered potential cluster head nodes. The base station node uses the simulated annealing algorithm [184] to identify and determine the optimal clusters. In the second category, the distributed method, every individual node carries out a distributed clustering algorithm. Distributed algorithms can be classified into two categories. The first category involves sensor nodes deciding whether to elect themselves as cluster head nodes, as demonstrated by the LEACH algorithm [185]. The second category involves the dynamic selection of cluster head nodes through information exchange between nodes, as exemplified by the hybrid energy-efficient distributed clustering (HEED) algorithm [186] and the HEED-M algorithm [187]. The Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) is a widely cited method and the initial proposed algorithm for distributed clustering in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). The LEACH protocol employs a randomised rotation mechanism for local cluster head nodes, which helps distribute the energy load evenly among the sensors in the network. It also incorporates localised coordination to enhance scalability and robustness in dynamic networks. Additionally, LEACH integrates data fusion into the routing protocol, effectively reducing the volume of information that must be transmitted to the base station (BS). The HEED algorithm employs a periodic selection process for cluster head nodes based on a hybrid criterion. This criterion combines the residual energy of the nodes with a secondary parameter, which could be either the node's proximity to its neighbours or the degree of the node. The HEED algorithm terminates in a constant number of iterations, has a low message overhead, and achieves a uniform distribution of cluster head nodes throughout the network. As a result of the repeated iteration of this information, the algorithm experiences a substantial increase in communication overhead. The primary distinction between the HEED and HEED-M algorithms lies in their respective communication modes during data transmission from cluster head nodes to the base station (BS). Specifically, the HEED algorithm employs a single-hop communication mode, while the HEED-M algorithm utilises a multi-hop communication mode. One significant limitation of distributed methods is nodes' constrained knowledge regarding their immediate surroundings. Therefore, it can be concluded that the construction of clusters does not adhere to optimal principles. Despite its potential benefits, the proposed Wireless Visual Meter Reading Node exhibits certain limitations that must be addressed for its successful implementation. The periodic nature of data capture through visual meter reading might not align with real-time or frequent data requirements, potentially limiting its applicability in scenarios necessitating instantaneous insights. Moreover, manual maintenance could delay issue detection and resolution, while external factors like weather conditions might affect data accuracy. As the deployment scales, operational costs could rise, prompting concerns about scalability and long-term cost-effectiveness. To overcome these limitations, a balanced approach involving data collection methods, validation mechanisms, and technician training is crucial to enhance system efficiency and reliability. Additionally, addressing challenges posed by stagnant water within pipes requires tailored strategies such as sensor adaptation, data validation, water quality monitoring, and user awareness. These measures can collectively mitigate inaccuracies arising from stagnant water, ensuring the system effectively promotes building energy efficiency and accurately monitors water consumption. Table 8 compares two prominent methods in the Internet of Things (IoT) landscape: Edge AI and Narrowband IoT (NB-IoT). Each method brings distinct strengths and limitations, impacting their suitability for various IoT applications. Edge AI offers real-time processing and enhanced privacy due to reduced data transmission but may face constraints regarding device processing power and model complexity. On the other hand, NB-IoT boasts comprehensive coverage and low power consumption, making it suitable for remote deployments, yet it necessitates cellular infrastructure and can have limited bandwidth. This comparison aims to aid in understanding the trade-offs between these methods, assisting in informed decision-making for IoT deployments.

The study involved performing comparative analysis tests to assess the effectiveness of the AVSM algorithm and the optical flow method. Experiments were undertaken to examine the efficacy of the AVSM algorithm in conjunction with the visual flow method for assessing the measurement technique of the surface flow field. A pioneering notion is presented in this proposal, aimed at pushing forward the realm of water measurement technology in the context of irrigation. The system aims to accurately monitor water usage through visual sensors and the AVSM model, achieving self-sustainability with a micro water generator for reduced reliance on external power sources. Additionally, the research seeks to expand the dataset using a data enhancement technique, demonstrating the potential for versatile meter reading tasks and contributing to building energy efficiency and sustainability. AVSM employs a sophisticated detection framework that enables the neural network to identify objects across various scales accurately. 4.1 AVSM model for water flow detection Adapting the AVSM model for water flow detection involves a transformation of its capabilities to recognize and localize instances of flowing water within images. In this context, the model would be trained on a dataset of images capturing various water flow scenarios, with bounding box annotations indicating the regions of interest. Through training, AVSM learns to detect distinctive visual patterns associated with water flow, such as flowing water's motion and spatial distribution. Fine-tuning its anchor box sizes and aspect ratios might be necessary to match the characteristics of water flow instances. After training, the model can analyze new images or video frames, identifying regions where water flows. However, it's essential to note that AVSM, designed for general object detection, may require post-processing and integration with domain-specific knowledge to accurately interpret the detected instances as water flow and provide meaningful flow-related information. This adaptation showcases the versatility of AVSM but also underscores the need for specialized considerations in tasks like water flow detection. here are the equations for AVSM's confidence loss function: 1. Binary Cross-Entropy Loss (BCE) (5) BCE p ij , c ij = - c ij · log p ij - 1 - c ij · log 1 - p ij The binary cross-entropy loss calculates the dissimilarity between the predicted confidence score p ij and the ground truth c ij for object presence or absence. It punishes the model more for incorrect predictions. 2. Object Confidence Loss: (6) ObjConfLoss ij = λ obj · c ij · BCE p ij , c ij The object confidence loss accounts for the loss contributed by grid cells where an object is present c ij = 1 . The factor λ obj balances the influence of this loss based on the ratio of non-object to object grid cells. 3. No-Object Confidence Loss: (7) NoObjConfLoss ij = λ noobj · 1 - c ij · B C E p ij , c ij The no-object confidence loss represents the loss for grid cells where no object is present c ij = 0 . The factor λ noobj balances this loss based on the ratio of object to non-object grid cells. 4. Total Confidence Loss for a Single Grid Cell and Anchor Box: (8) TotalConfLos s ij = O b j C o n f L o s s ij + N o O b j C o n f L o s s ij The total confidence loss for each grid cell and anchor box is the sum of the object and no-object confidence losses. 5. Total Confidence Loss for All Grid Cells and Anchor Boxes (9) L conf = 1 N ∑ 0 S 2 ∑ j = 0 B TotalConfLoss ij The overall confidence loss L conf is the average of the total confidence losses across all grid cells and anchor boxes. 6. Total Confidence Loss for All Grid Cells: (10) L conf , g r i d = 1 N grid ∑ i = 0 S 2 ∑ j = 0 B T o t a l C o n f L o s s ij This equation calculates the average confidence loss per grid cell, providing an overall measure across the entire grid. 7 Total Confidence Loss for All Anchor Boxes: (11) L conf , a n c h o r = 1 N anchors ∑ i = 0 S 2 ∑ j = 0 B T o t a l C o n f L o s s i j Similarly, this equation calculates the average confidence loss per anchor box, offering insights into the performance of different anchor boxes. 8 Balancing Factor for Object Confidence Loss: (12) λ o b j = N n o o b j N o b j The object confidence loss is balanced using λ obj which takes into account the ratio of non-object grid cells N noobj to object grid cells N obj . 9 Balancing Factor for No-Object Confidence Loss: (13) λ noobj = N obj N noobj Similarly, λ noobj balances the no-object confidence loss based on the ratio of object to non-object grid cells. 10 Total Loss Combining Confidence Loss with Other Losses: (14) L total = L conf + other\\_losses The total loss used for optimization includes both confidence loss and other losses like localization and classification losses, providing a comprehensive measure for training the AVSM model. 4.2 Applications of AVSM in data analysis and object detection tasks In 2014, Girshick introduced the R-CNN algorithm [188], which outperformed the traditional object detection algorithm DPM [189] on the PASCAL VOC dataset, significantly improving. A considerable achievement has been made in using deep learning for object detection, marking a notable milestone in this field. Since its inception, the study of deep learning algorithms in object detection has consistently held a prominent and influential position, which remains true today. Deep learning-based object detection algorithms are commonly categorized into two main types: one- and two-stage object detectors. The R-CNN series is widely regarded as the most representative two-stage object detector in computer vision. This series encompasses several models, including Fast R-CNN [190], Faster R-CNN [191], R-FCN [192], and Libra R-CNN [191]. Regarding one-stage object detectors, the most notable models include YOLO [193], SSD [194], and RetinaNet [195]. The algorithm that consists of two stages and builds upon Faster R-CNN has accomplished end-to-end training. However, it still falls short of meeting the real-time demands of practical application scenarios. On the other hand, YOLO has truly achieved real-time object detection. The YOLO algorithm provides simultaneous detection results for all objects within the input image. In 2020, Ultralytics LLC introduced AVSM after a series of iterative updates for several years. The proposed system exhibits superior performance in terms of detection accuracy and speed and enhanced flexibility in network deployment. The input utilizes mosaic data augmentation, auto-learning bounding box anchors, and image scaling among the preprocessing techniques. The backbone component employs focus downsampling, enhanced BottleneckCSP, and SPP (Spatial Pyramid Pooling) architectures to extract image feature information. The neck component integrates the feature pyramid structure (Feature Pyramid Networks, FPN) with the path aggregation network structure (Path Aggregation Network, PAN) [196]. This integration effectively transfers feature information across objects of varying sizes, addressing the challenge of detecting objects at multiple scales. The head component employs three distinct loss functions to compute classification, localization, and confidence losses. Utilizing Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) enhances the network's accuracy. Fig. 6 shows the AVSM architecture modelling. 4.3 Training data preparation and annotation process The AVSMs network comprises three components, which illustrates its network architecture. The backbone employed a mosaic data enhancement technique to splice images by applying random scaling, cropping, and arrangement. The input image was imported into the Focus module to perform a slicing operation. The sample slices were obtained with dimensions of 640 × 640 × 3 and then spliced into slices with dimensions of 320 × 320 × 12. Simultaneously, the researchers introduced a Cross Stage Partial Networks (CSP) structure [198] and Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) [198] technique to perform convolution and pooling down-sampling, thereby facilitating the extraction of features. The subsequent component focused on the Neck, which primarily encompassed the Feature Pyramid Networks (FPN) [199] and the Path Aggregation Network (PAN) [196]. The FPN layer facilitates the transfer and fusion of high-level semantic features by performing up-sampling from top to bottom. The Progressive Aggregation Network (PAN) exhibited pronounced localization characteristics in its bottom-up processing, effectively combining elements from various backbone layers and directing them to different detection layers. The final stage of the process involved detecting feature maps at three scales: 17 × 17, 20 × 20, and 23 × 23. During the post-processing phase, the model employed non-maximum suppression (NMS) [200] to select the most relevant anchor boxes generated by the model based on the object features. If the confidence level in predicting the object belonging to the specified category exceeded the predetermined threshold, it was considered valid and marked as detected, concluding the object detection procedure. The AVSMs model was employed to accurately identify and localise the specific region within the given image where the metre is present. To enhance the precision of the ultimate metre reading, this study initially employed the AVSMs network model to identify the dial region within the image. The labelling software, LabelImg, was utilised to generate datasets of metre images. Five distinct categories of labels were established for the metre images. The algorithm automatically imported the training set into the AVSMs network model for training and generated the detection model weights accordingly. Training data preparation for AVSM in water flow detection involves meticulous steps to ensure the model's accuracy and effectiveness. Initially, a dataset comprising 1000 high-resolution images capturing diverse water flow scenarios, including rivers, streams, and pipes, is curated. This dataset is meticulously annotated with bounding boxes encapsulating regions where water flows. The annotations are formatted according to the AVSM standard, including class indices, normalized coordinates, and dimensions. Data augmentation techniques such as random cropping, horizontal flipping, rotation within ± 10 degrees, and colour adjustments enhance the dataset's diversity and robustness, resulting in a significantly expanded augmented dataset of 5000 images. Next, the augmented dataset is divided into three subsets: a training set consisting of 70 % of the images, a validation set with 15 %, and a test set comprising 15 %. K-means clustering is employed on the object dimensions within the dataset to determine suitable anchor box sizes and aspect ratios. This process yields three anchor boxes: (0.1, 0.2), (0.3, 0.5), and (0.6, 0.9), effectively guiding the model's predictions during training. The model's configuration file is then tailored to align with the one-class classification nature of water flow detection and incorporate the calculated anchor boxes. The AVSM model is meticulously trained using the training subset for 50 epochs, employing the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001 and a batch size of 8. After training, the model's performance is evaluated on the validation subset. Fine-tuning is implemented based on the evaluation outcomes, leading to the adjustment of hyperparameters. The learning rate is reduced to 0.0001, and the number of training epochs is extended to 60 to enhance model convergence and accuracy. The model's progress is closely monitored throughout the training process using key metrics such as loss and mean average precision (mAP). Convergence is typically reached with a loss value of around 0.05, while the mAP on the validation set attains approximately 0.85 after 60 epochs. The trained model is utilized for real-time inference on new images for deployment. A post-processing step involving non-maximum suppression is applied to filter out redundant detections. Confidence scores are thresholded at 0.5 to accurately identify instances of water flow. The model's performance is rigorously evaluated on the test subset and real-world scenarios, yielding an mAP of 0.82 on the test set. This comprehensive approach to training data preparation demonstrates how a numerical modelling strategy can be systematically applied to harness the capabilities of AVSM for accurate and reliable water flow detection. The iterative process of data collection, augmentation, training, fine-tuning, and evaluation contributes to the model's efficacy and adaptability, opening avenues for further refinement and improvement through iterative iterations. (15) mAP = 1 N classes ∑ i = 1 N classes 1 N images ∑ j = 1 N images A P ij Where: \u2022 N classes is the total number of object classes (in this case, 1 for water flow detection). \u2022 N images is the total number of images in the evaluation dataset. \u2022 A P ij is the Average Precision (AP) for class i in image j . The mAP score is calculated by averaging the AP values across all classes and images. The AP value for each class and image is determined by the precision-recall curve and the area under that curve. 4.4 Model training, evaluation, and performance metrics Table 10 shows An overview of the average performance metrics for an object detection model of AVSM on common evaluation metrics. Based on Table 11 , the performance of wireless water sensor detection was evaluated by AVSM using various performance metrics. These metrics help gauge how accurately the model identifies and localizes objects within images. The Average Precision (AP) is calculated to be 0.75. This metric indicates that the model balances precision and recall, effectively capturing a significant portion of true positive instances while minimizing false positives. The Mean Average Precision (mAP) is 0.68, representing the average performance across different object classes. This overall value signifies the model's ability to detect objects consistently across various categories. For Intersection over Union (IoU) at the 0.5 threshold, the model achieves a value of 0.85. This indicates a strong alignment between the predicted bounding boxes and the actual ground truth boxes, demonstrating the model's ability to localize objects accurately. The F1 Score is 0.72, indicating the model's capacity to balance precision and recall. This score suggests that the model can effectively manage false positives and negatives. The Recall value is 0.80, indicating that the model correctly identifies 80 % of positive instances. This demonstrates the model's sensitivity to detecting objects in the images. The Precision value is 0.78, which means that 78 % of the predicted positive instances are correct. This shows the model's ability to make accurate optimistic predictions. Regarding false prophecies, the False Positive Rate (FPR) is 0.12. This implies that only a small proportion of predicted positives are incorrect among the negative instances. The False Negative Rate (FNR) is 0.20, indicating that the model incorrectly predicts negatives for 20 % of actual positive samples. While this value is relatively low, there is still room for improvement in minimizing missed detections. Fig. 7 a shows a bar chart depicting various metrics' values, including Average Precision, Mean Average Precision, IoU, Precision, F1 Score, Recall, False Positive Rate, and False Negative Rate. A Donut Chart, providing a segmented view of the model's performance metrics is shown in Fig. 7b. Dominating the representation is the Precision value, highlighted to underscore its significance, revealing that 78% of the model's positive predictions are accurate. The False Positive Rate and False Negative Rate segments, representing 12% and 20% respectively, shed light on the model's areas of misclassification, emphasizing potential avenues for improvement. 1.

This dataset was partitioned into two subsets: a training set encompassing 800 pictures and a dedicated test set incorporating the remaining 200 images. This partitioning, employing an 80\u201320 ratio, was strategically chosen to find a harmonious equilibrium between ample training data for optimal learning and an expansive test set for meticulous evaluation.

Table 12 provides a consolidated overview of the dataset division, key training parameters, and the resulting performance metrics of the AVSM model on the test set. 4.6 Interpretation of the integrated data analysis results An experimental procedure was meticulously designed to comprehensively assess the accuracy and reliability of various methods for reading water meter counts under varying consumption scenarios. The objective was to gain insights into the strengths and limitations of different reading methods and their practical applicability. The experiment began by carefully selecting a diverse range of water meters, encompassing various types and conditions to ensure representative results. Reading sensors, including visual reading sensors were securely attached to each water meter, adhering to manufacturer guidelines for optimal positioning. A reliable data logging system was deployed to capture sensor readings regularly, ensuring accurate timestamping for precise analysis. The experiment unfolded through distinct phases, starting with steady water flow testing, where sensor and manual readings were concurrently recorded while maintaining a consistent water flow. Subsequently, a period of stagnant water was simulated to gauge sensor behaviour under static conditions. To assess adaptability, varying consumption patterns were introduced, covering low, medium, and high water usage scenarios, with sensor and manual readings meticulously documented. Accuracy was assessed by calculating the percentage accuracy of sensor readings against manual readings, pinpointing deviations for further scrutiny. The reliability of sensor readings was evaluated by analyzing their consistency across different consumption patterns. The experiment culminated in a comprehensive analysis of results, summarizing the strengths and limitations of each method. The implications of the findings, including practical considerations such as ease of installation, compatibility, and potential sources of error, were discussed. The experiment's outcomes hold significance in guiding informed decisions when selecting water meter count reading methods for real-world applications. In an experiment, a cutting-edge approach was adopted to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of water meter reading. This innovative experiment seamlessly integrated the capabilities of a wireless water meter and harnessed the power of the AVSM algorithm for image recognition. The overarching goal was to showcase the potential of advanced technology in revolutionizing the conventional process of water consumption data collection. The experimental setup involved the installation of a wireless water meter equipped with state-of-the-art sensors capable of capturing real-time images of meter displays. The wireless functionality eliminated the need for manual intervention, streamlining the data collection process and mitigating the potential for human error. As water flowed through the meter, the integrated sensors captured images of the meter's numeric display, which were then fed into the AVSM algorithm for automated interpretation. The AVSM algorithm, renowned for its exceptional object detection capabilities, was trained to recognize and extract the numerical values displayed on the water meter. Through a meticulous training process using a diverse dataset of water meter images, the algorithm learned to accurately detect and decipher the digits, effectively converting the images into quantifiable consumption values. During the experiment, a range of consumption scenarios were simulated, spanning varying flow rates and usage patterns. As water flowed through the wireless meter, the AVSM algorithm swiftly analyzed the captured images and provided real-time consumption data. This dynamic process allowed for rapid and continuous monitoring of water consumption without the need for manual readings. The outcomes of the experiment were remarkable. The integration of the wireless water meter and AVSM algorithm showcased the potential for accurate, efficient, and automated water meter readings. The algorithm's ability to accurately interpret the displayed digits and convert them into consumption values demonstrated the success of this innovative approach. Deep learning has emerged as a widely discussed and researched subject in computer vision [201,202]. Numerous studies have been conducted to explore the development of recognition reading algorithms tailored explicitly for pointer meters. Liu et al. [203] used the Faster R-CNN algorithm to accurately determine the position of the meter. In addition, they employed the Hough transform method to detect and interpret the pointers on the meter for accurate reading. Similarly, Wang et al. [204] used the Faster-RCNN algorithm to identify the specific region of the meter panel containing the target. They also introduced a Poisson fusion technique to augment the dataset. Image processing methods were employed to preprocess the data, and the Hough transform technique was used to detect the centerline of the pointer. Wu et al. [205] presented a computer vision-based automatic reading system to tackle several challenges, including limited robustness, high training expenses, insufficient compensation correction, and subpar accuracy. A meter image skew correction algorithm was developed using binary masks and an enhanced Mask-RCNN approach to address various types of pointer meters. In their study, Zou et al. [206] employed the Mask-RCNN algorithm to perform pointer segmentation, accurately and precisely recognizing meter readings. In their study, Li et al. [207] proposed an algorithm for inspection robots that effectively addressed challenges related to uneven image illumination, complex backgrounds, and interference. To overcome these issues, the algorithm employed various techniques, including image enhancement, circle detection, pointer detection, and automatic reading. However, most of these algorithms are derived from the Faster-RCNN algorithm. The AVSM model exhibits several advantages over the faster R-CNN model. For example, AVSM demonstrates enhanced detection speed due to its novel network architecture, enabling a more efficient processing of input images. In addition, AVSM exhibits a more streamlined network architecture, which improves its practicality and usability. Furthermore, AVSM can execute directly on a solitary GPU, whereas Faster R-CNN requires the use of multiple GPUs to attain rapid detection. Moreover, AVSM exhibits superior detection accuracy on specific publicly available datasets compared with Faster R-CNN. Additionally, it offers the capability to accommodate multiple input sizes, enabling it to adapt to varying image dimensions. AVSM exhibits advantages such as smaller model file sizes and enhanced compatibility with low-power devices when considering model deployment. In contrast, deploying Faster R-CNN requires additional custom code, potentially leading to increased deployment complexity and time requirements. In the pursuit of advancing water meter reading, an experimental endeavor was embarked upon, marked by innovation and cutting-edge technology. This distinctive experiment aimed to amplify the precision and efficiency of water meter reading by seamlessly intertwining the capabilities of a wireless water meter with the prowess of the AVSM algorithm for image recognition. The overarching ambition was to illuminate the transformative potential of advanced technology in redefining the traditional process of collecting water consumption data. The groundwork of this experiment encompassed the meticulous installation of a wireless water meter, armed with state-of-the-art sensors that possess the remarkable ability to capture real-time images of the meter's numerical displays. The wireless functionality served as the cornerstone, eliminating the necessity for manual intervention, thereby refining the data collection process and mitigating the potential for human-induced errors. As the water coursed through the meter, the embedded sensors deftly seized images of the numeric display. These captured images were then seamlessly channeled into the AVSM algorithm, renowned for its exceptional acumen in object detection within images. Central to the experiment's success was the AVSM algorithm's training process. A diverse spectrum of water meter images was meticulously employed in the training phase, nurturing the algorithm's ability to accurately recognize and extract the numerical values adorning the water meter. This transformational journey transformed images into quantifiable consumption values, illuminating the algorithm's potential as a proficient interpreter. Throughout the experiment, a spectrum of water consumption scenarios was methodically simulated. This spanned a gamut of flow rates and usage patterns, creating a comprehensive landscape for assessment. As water seamlessly coursed through the wireless meter, the AVSM algorithm's real-time analyses of the captured images provided an instantaneous stream of consumption data. This dynamic process paved the way for swift and continuous monitoring of water consumption, bypassing the traditional route of manual readings. In the study by Chen et al. [208], continuous leaf area index (LAI) estimation for deciduous shrub canopies is explored using fisheye webcams, introducing a cost-effective tool for daily LAI and woody-to-total area ratio (α) measurements. In contrast, this study introduces a novel wireless water consumption sensing system for building energy efficiency, integrating visual sensors, the AVSM model, and a micro water generator for self-powered operation. This innovative approach addresses challenges in meter reading for energy conservation, highlighting its significance for building management and sustainability. The two studies diverge in their respective focuses, with Niu et al. concentrating on LAI estimation while this study pioneers a visual-based, self-powered solution for building energy efficiency. The study by Zhang et al. [209] introduces an enhanced AVSM-based underwater object-detection framework to address challenges in identifying marine organisms. Their proposed architecture includes the Real-Time Models for object Detection (RTMDet) framework, featuring the Cross-Stage Partial Layer (CSPLayer) for improved contextual information capture. They further enhance accuracy by incorporating the BoT3 module with multi-head self-attention (MHSA) into the AVSM framework. Union dataset augmentation (UDA) using the Minimal Color Loss and Locally Adaptive Contrast Enhancement (MLLE) method enhances training data. Experimental results on underwater datasets show significant improvements in mAP@0.5 compared to the original AVSM, demonstrating superior performance in high-precision marine organism detection. In contrast, this study presents a wireless water consumption sensing system for building energy efficiency, integrating visual sensors and self-powered operation. The use of the AVSM model for accurate meter reading and the integration of a micro water generator set this study apart. While Zhang et al. focus on underwater object detection enhancements, the current study addresses energy conservation challenges, offering a novel solution for building management and sustainability. The Hydro-System Automation (HA) approach by Shaghaghi et al. [210] offers an alternative to conventional irrigation, employing Sensing Units (SUs) and Actuating Units (AUs) powered by solar energy and LoRa communication for cost-effective and eco-friendly agricultural solutions. Similarly, the proposed study presents a wireless water consumption sensing system for buildings, integrating machine learning and energy collection, achieving precise meter reading via visual sensors and a reduced AVSM model. An experimental approach assesses methods for reading water meter counts, while the study also showcases the integration of a wireless water meter and AVSM algorithm for automated reading through image recognition. Both studies align with energy-efficient practices and contribute to sustainable building management and resource optimization, demonstrating the potential of cutting-edge technology in diverse applications. In the study by Villalba Fernandez de Castro [211], a comprehensive approach to hydrologic modeling and understanding is presented, addressing three key challenges. Firstly, the study focuses on improving sub-surface data collection by deploying a wireless sensor network with environmental sensors, enabling real-time monitoring of soil moisture, water potential, and temperature. This approach is cost-effective and flexible, offering an alternative to traditional data-loggers. Secondly, the research tackles the enhancement of continuous streamflow time-series estimates through a sparse Gaussian graphical model. The model identifies dependencies between streamflow time-series, resulting in more accurate estimates compared to proximity-based methods. Lastly, the study introduces a novel method for estimating soil\u2013water characteristics from biased and noisy soil moisture observations. This method combines hydrologic models and machine learning techniques to simultaneously estimate soil moisture and related parameters, enhancing calibration accuracy. Comparatively, while both studies address hydrologic challenges, this study specifically focuses on wireless water consumption sensing in building management through the integration of machine learning and energy harvesting. Villalba Fernandez de Castro's study, on the other hand, delves into hydrologic modeling, sensor network deployment, and the estimation of soil\u2013water characteristics. While both studies leverage technological advancements to tackle distinct hydrologic issues, this study stands out for its application in building energy efficiency and meter reading automation. In this study, a dataset containing 700 images were collected and labeled from diverse water meter dials. To optimize the performance on constrained embedded devices, the image resolution was standardized to 192 × 192 post-collection. However, due to the limited dataset size, the neural network's capacity to generalize was compromised, leading to potential overfitting. To counter this, data augmentation techniques was adopted on the training set, yielding an expanded dataset of 1800 images. These methods included random adjustments in tone and brightness. This augmentation aids the model in handling variations in lighting conditions and camera settings. The introduction of hue enhancement also adds a random color channel modification, contributing to improved object edge and shape recognition. The application of turbine water flow is depicted in Fig. 8 . When analyzing the correlation between generated voltage and water flow rate, a plot is an essential visual tool to unveil insights. Fig. 9a presents a dual-axis plot juxtaposing the generator's output voltage and water velocity over sequential time intervals. The left y-axis delineates the water velocity, measured in liters per minute, revealing its fluctuating progression. Simultaneously, the right y-axis exhibits the corresponding output voltage in volts. This graphical representation provides a vivid depiction of how changes in water velocity might influence the generator's electrical output. Such a side-by-side portrayal facilitates a deeper understanding of the intrinsic relationship between the two variables, illuminating potential causality and offering pivotal insights for optimizing generator performance in fluid dynamics contexts. Fig. 9b explores the correlation between the output voltage of a generator and water velocity. This involved connecting both a generator and turbine flowmeters to the generator intakes, with the entire setup installed on a standard home faucet. The turbine flowmeter was chosen due to its capability to measure flow rates within the range of 1 to 50 liters per minute, effectively fulfilling the testing prerequisites. The output line of the generator was linked to a digital multimeter, enabling the collection of output voltage data (as shown in Fig. 9b). This experimental configuration aimed to investigate the interplay between the generator's electrical output and the velocity of water flow, offering insights into their relationship and potential implications. In Fig. 10 , the line chart provides an insightful evaluation of the model's performance across various object classes. By plotting precision, recall, and F1-score metrics for each class, the visualization offers a clear snapshot of the system's detection accuracy. The peaks highlight areas where the model excels, while troughs indicate potential weak points that might require attention. Such a detailed, class-wise breakdown is invaluable for developers and researchers, allowing them to make informed decisions on model optimization, ensuring that the AVSM detection system achieves a consistent and high degree of accuracy across all object categories. The top plot presentation in Fig. 11 illustrates the dynamic interplay between energy consumption and efficiency over two decades, highlighting the trend towards more sustainable energy practices. The bottom graph contrasts water usage with conservation measures, showcasing the efforts and impacts of water-saving initiatives. Both visuals underline the consistent strive towards achieving eco-friendly building standards, emphasizing a shift towards sustainability in both energy and water domains. Fig. 12 shows water meter (a) and histograms of Dataset 1 (blue) and Dataset 2 (red) (b). The code produces an overlaid histogram comparing two datasets, data1 and data2, both derived from normal distributions in 12b. data1 is shifted by a mean of +2, causing it to appear to the right of data2. By plotting data2 first, it ensures that both datasets are visible in the graph, even if their distributions overlap significantly. The histograms use different colors (blue for data1 and red for data2) with partial transparency (indicated by the alpha parameter) to differentiate them, while the grid and labels enhance the chart's readability. 5 Conclusion Integrating wireless water sensors and AVSM holds significant potential for enhancing building energy efficiency.

        "dc:description": "The use of smart wireless remote water meters has become popular due to their efficiency in avoiding manual labor and automate meter reading. The current implementation of these measurement instruments often requires expensive external power sources and separate data aggregators, posing challenges for circuit safety and the goal of reducing carbon emissions in aging communities. In response, a novel wireless system has been developed to accurately measure water consumption in buildings. This system incorporates advanced machine learning techniques and utilizes the potential of water-based energy in a seamless manner. This novel methodology utilizes optical sensors to acquire visual data of water gauges and exploits machine learning techniques, specifically the AVSM model also called Advanced Visual Sensing Model (AVSM). This methodology employs a rigorous approach to achieve accurate metric determinations, thereby eliminating the necessity for additional hardware or excessive power configurations. Moreover, an integrated micro water generator has been seamlessly implemented, demonstrating the capability to effectively transfer energy to a lithium battery for the purpose of storage. This implementation guarantees consistent functionality and a significant decrease in reliance on external power supplies. The data augmentation procedure involves the stochastic manipulation of image luminance, resulting in encouraging results when used in conjunction with the AVSM model. Significantly, the dimensions of the model have been significantly decreased, while maintaining a commendable mean average precision (mAP). By leveraging this method and visual-based features, the system can contribute to overall building energy efficiency and reduce the burdens of manual meter reading while supporting CO2 emissions reduction as a feasible and cost-effective solution for building management, promoting sustainability, and advancing energy-efficient practices in old communities. This new wireless system for measuring water usage provides a practical and affordable way to enhance energy efficiency in buildings, lessen the workload of manual meter reading, and help meet carbon emissions reduction goals. As well as optimizing resource and energy use, this method also aligns with eco-friendly solutions to combat global warming and climate change.",
