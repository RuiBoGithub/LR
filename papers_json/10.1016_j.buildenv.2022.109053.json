KU Leuven, Department of Civil Engineering Ghent 9000 Belgium In educational buildings, the HVAC system is a major contributor to the total energy use. It is well-known that energy reductions could be achieved by more advanced control strategies for HVAC systems. A model predictive control (MPC) strategy could be a viable solution. Contrary to the standard rule based control (RBC), the predictive control can adjust in the supply air temperature, airflow rate prior to the start of a lecture. This study aims to develop and demonstrate an MPC framework for an all-air system that controls both the room temperature and the CO2-concentrations. To predict these variables two model identification techniques were compared: auto-regressive with exogenous input (ARX-MPC) linear model and a grey-box resistor\u2013capacitor nonlinear model (RC-NMPC). In addition, a cost function that minimized the energy use while guaranteeing thermal comfort and indoor air quality (IAQ) was formulated. This study showed that the ARX-MPC was preferred over the RC-NMPC given its simplicity. As for the model identification, the ARX model was less computationally time-consuming than the grey-box model. Furthermore, the RC-NMPC required more computational time than the ARX-MPC, since the RC-NMPC required a non-linear solver while the ARX-MPC used a linear one. The developed MPC framework was than implemented through BACnet in a real-use educational building to test its actual performance. The energy savings calculated for the implemented MPC strategies with an occupancy based heating set-point were respectively 10%\u201340% for electric energy use and 21%\u201355% for thermal energy use. Keywords Building climate control Model predictive control Controller model Optimization Field test 1 Introduction The building energy sector is responsible for approximately 36% of the total energy use out of which 50% is attributed to heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems [1\u20133]. This high energy use compounds global warming effects due to the increase in anthropocentric gas emissions (e.g. CO2) [4]. Therefore, significant efforts are required to reduce the building sector\u2019s energy use. In fact, one of the aims of the European Union (EU) is to achieve a highly energy-efficient and decarbonized building stock by 2050 [5]. Several strategies have been adopted to reduce the energy use. In buildings, transmission and infiltration losses have already been significantly decreased by improving the building envelope (e.g., higher insulation levels and increased air-tightness) [2]. All-air systems are a specific type of HVAC system, where the heating and cooling delivery is air based. These type of systems can deliver high quantities of fresh air and are often applied in offices and educational buildings that have a high and variable occupancy profiles [6]. To reduce the energy demand for ventilation systems, control strategies such as demand controlled ventilation (DCV) combined with heat recovery are viable options in non-residential nearly zero energy buildings (nZEB) [7,8]. DCV is a type of rule based control (RBC) that adjusts supply conditions (i.e., supply temperature and airflow rate) based on competing CO2 and room temperature needs. In non-residential spaces with high occupancy and intermittent use (e.g., meeting rooms, open offices and classrooms), there are large changes in heat loads and CO2-concentrations. To guarantee satisfactory thermal comfort and indoor air quality (IAQ), often; ventilation rates need to be increased resulting in a higher fan electricity use and a higher heating demand. Therefore, in these type of spaces; during rapidly changing ventilation and air-conditioning demands, a RBC consisting of PI controls can overshoot to compensate for previous integration errors [9]. This leads to increased energy use and compromises thermal comfort and IAQ [10\u201314]. Furthermore, increasing the insulation level and air-tightness of the building envelope affects the response time of the building and increases the risk of overheating [15]. More advanced HVAC control strategies and optimization could prove viable in mitigating buildings\u2019 intensive energy use [16,17]. In general, HVAC systems are challenging to control, due to time varying dynamics and varying internal/external disturbances [18,19]. One of the most promising techniques for a more efficient control of HVAC systems is model predictive control (MPC). An MPC can dynamically adjust the HVAC system set-point based on current measurements and future demand [19,20]. Inside the MPC framework, an identified dynamic model predicts the future states of a system and/or building based on forecasts of internal and external disturbances (e.g., occupants, solar heat gains). The MPC designer defines an optimization problem that includes an objective with a cost function and sets of constraints and future disturbances to make predictions. The objective is typically a cost function that minimizes the energy use while simultaneously guaranteeing IAQ and thermal comfort. However, two potentially conflicting goals have to be met when optimizing the control of an HVAC system: (1) maximizing the user comfort, (2) reducing the energy use. Finally, the objective function solves the optimization problem by determining the optimal control action and the controller actuates the output values based on the identified model to verify the solution. indicated the potential energy savings by improving the control of HVAC systems based on a physical single-zone model. The results showed that average readily achievable savings from improved non predictive control are 1%\u201315%, while average theoretical savings potentials for predictive control are 16%\u201341%. Furthermore, Oldewurtel et al. [21] stated that MPC is an ideal framework for control, as the building dynamics can be slow and the building is subject to intermittent disturbances (i.e. weather conditions, occupants and building appliances). In buildings with hydronic systems, the reported energy reductions after implementing MPC were significant [22\u201327]. In all-air systems, the response time is faster compared to hydronic systems, potentially reducing the benefits of MPC. Naylor et al. [28] highlighted four factors that extended the response time of HVAC systems to changing demand and that are likely to increase the potential of MPC implementation: (1) spaces with a large open-plan footprint, (2) high thermal mass, (3) large changes in occupancy and (4) highly intermittent space use. Furthermore, it is questionable if the benefits of MPC justify its implementation effort and increased computational demand over RBC [28]. Most of the effort is devoted to model creation and calibration, which is 70% of costs in building monitoring system (BMS) projects [29]. Model identification for MPC is the bottleneck of since it is complex and time consuming [30,31]. The challenge is to obtain a simple model that is able to accurately predict the future behaviour of the considered system [32\u201336]. In the literature few studies developed and implemented an MPC framework for all-air systems, controlling both room temperature and indoor CO2-concentration. One of the few examples is the study by Bengea et al. [37], that applied an MPC in an office building with an all-air system. The MPC proved to be an improvement for all-air system control as energy use was decreased by 20%. However, the cost function only minimized the energy cost and did not consider the thermal comfort or IAQ. Bursill [38] implemented an MPC through a BACnet agent in an institutional building with an air-forced system. The MPC reduced the energy use in the heating season by 18% and by 42% in the cooling season. Parisio et al. [39] developed a dual stage MPC, which first solved for CO2 and then temperature. This structure sets priority for CO2 as the output of the CO2-MPC is the minimum input constraint for the temperature MPC. Walker et al. [40] developed a dual stage MPC that included the CO2 discomfort in the cost function combined with the thermal comfort and energy use. As indicated, there is still a need to test and demonstrate MPC for all-air systems in real-use buildings with high intermittent use, to enhance its applicability. Furthermore, MPC is a time-consuming and complex process that requires significant computational power and expert knowledge [41]. As a result, the application in non-residential buildings is still limited. In addition, real implementation of MPC often adds additional challenges that remain unnoticed when performing simulations. For example, unexpected changes, comfort complaints, commissioning errors, missing or malfunctioning sensors or low-resolution data are often a cause of a poor performance [42,43]. Furthermore, the integration with the building automation system (BAS) can be time-consuming and expensive [44]. This indicates that there is a need for a systematic approach for real MPC application for all-air systems. The aim of this study is to develop an MPC framework that controls an all-air system and to demonstrate its potential in a real-use educational building. The structure of the paper is as follows: In Section 2, a description of the case study building was presented. Section 3 explained the method used for the MPC framework implemented in the building, the model identification and the optimization problem for the two MPC methods. Afterwards, the results of the MPC operation were presented in Section 4, as well as the indoor temperatures and CO2 concentrations. In the conclusion, the main results were evaluated and a possible direction for future research were presented. 2 Case study building The case study building is an educational building (Fig. 1) and located in Ghent, Belgium. The building is built on top of an existing university building and contains four zones: two large lecture rooms, a staircase and a technical room. The floor area of each lecture room measures 140 m2 with a volume 380 m3 and a maximum capacity of 80 students per lecture room. The building is used for educational purposes while simultaneously serving as a test facility for research on energy-efficient building strategies. 2.1 Building envelope The U-values of the construction parts were listed in Table 1. The solar heat gain coefficient for the glazing is 0.52. The window to wall ratio is 26% for the NE facade and 27% for the southwest facade. Air-tightness at 50 Pa (n50) of the lecture rooms is 1.1 air change rates per hour (ACH) for the first floor and 1.0 ACH for the second floor. Movable external blinds are applied on the windows on the southwest side. Blinds are closed when the incident solar radiation exceeds 250 W/m2 with a dead band of 50 W/m2, this reduces the g-value to 0.08. More information about the design process can be found in [45]. 2.2 HVAC system The HVAC system consist of a DCV system with an air-to-air heat exchanger (the efficiency according to the manufacturer data is 78%). A scheme of the HVAC system is shown in Fig. 2, indicating the position of the supply and extract VAV boxes for each room. The VAVs control the air flow rate based on measurements of CO2-concentrations and operative temperature in the lecture rooms. The maximum air flow rate per room is set at 2200 m3/h and the minimum at 400 m3/h. Fan speed is variable and based on a constant pressure control inside the ducts of 200 Pa. The location of the supply- and extract air grilles was shown in Fig. 2. Two heating coils of 8 kW are integrated in the supply ducts to control the supply air temperature. The heating production system consists of a condensing wood pellet boiler with an internal storage of 600 l. The maximum heating power is 8 kW with a maximum efficiency of 80%. The supply and extract fan have a maximum power of respectively 1.57 kW and 1.33 kW with an efficiency of 71%. The efficiency of the fan motors is 85%. Indirect evaporative cooling (IEC) is provided with a maximum capacity of 13.1 kW. In addition, window opening is controlled to allow for ventilative cooling. The operation and evaluation of the night-time ventilation and IEC were discussed in Breesch et al. [45]. 2.3 Current control HVAC system The lecture rooms were used during the academic year, which consists of 124 days with courses and 53 days with exams (in January, June and August-September). Holiday periods are in April (2 weeks), July and the first half of August (6 weeks) and December\u2013January (2 weeks). The lecture rooms were in use from Monday to Friday between 8:15 h and 18:00 h. The AHU was operated from 07:30\u201318:00 h during weekdays. This setting was chosen by the facility manager. During the measurements, the CO2 set-point for the DCV system in use was set at 1000 ppm, which corresponded to IDA class 3, with an air flow of 28 m3/(h.pers) [46]. The heating set-point was set at 22 ° C , with a dead band of ±0.5 ° C . The temperature during non-operating hours was set at 15 ° C . The operations of the bypass and the IEC are controlled by the indoor and outdoor temperature and is demonstrated in Fig. 3. This control strategy was defined by the manufacturer. 3 MPC framework 3.1 Overview The aim of the MPC is to minimize the energy use while guaranteeing IAQ and thermal comfort. The room CO2-concentration and air temperature were controlled by the MPC by adjusting the airflow rate and the supply air temperature. Fig. 4 illustrates the developed MPC framework consisting of the three following steps: (1) the disturbances, (2) the predictive controller, and (3) the building and ventilation system. In step (1), the framework collected the forecast of global horizontal irradiation (GHI), outdoor temperature (T o u t d o o r ), and occupancy profiles, for the complete prediction horizon and forwarded the data to the predictive controller. The number of expected persons is obtained from the weekly lecture schedules, made available by the university administration the Friday prior to the start of the new week. The comfort criteria included a predefined heating set-point and a minimum airflow rate set-point according to the implemented control. During operating hours, the heating set-point of the rooms is in function of the occupancy status of the room (i.e., present or absence of occupants). it is described as follows: \u2022 18:00\u201307:30: 16 ° C \u2022 07:30\u201318:00: unoccupied 20 ° C \u2022 07:30\u201318:00: occupied 22 ° C The constraint for the minimal room temperature was set based on these three defined conditions. Furthermore, the current measurement values for the room temperature and CO2-concentration were collected using the measurement update available from the building and ventilation system. All the collected information was then forwarded to the predictive controller. Step (2) of the framework involves the predictive controller, controlling the VAV damper position for each room and the minimum supply air temperature set-point at each time step. Based on historical data suitable models were identified to capture the heating dynamics of the building and system [47]. In addition, a model was identified to capture the CO2 generation rate by occupants to enable CO2 predictions for future time-steps. These models predict the room CO2-concentration and the room temperature for the complete prediction horizon. The predictive controller includes either grey-box model or an ARX model, depending on the scenario tested. Furthermore, constraints were defined for the predictive controller that are used for optimization. Soft constraints were defined for the comfort constraints to penalize constraints violations for the minimum and maximum room temperature and the CO2 set-point. Hard constraints were set on the airflow rate and the heating coil capacity. In addition, a cost function was defined to minimize the energy use for both the fans and heating coils with respect to thermal comfort and IAQ. Step (3) of the framework involves setting the optimized control output (supply air temperature and airflow rate) to control the all-air system. Through the BACnet interface of the AHU, the VAV damper position and the minimum supply air temperature were set for each room separately by writing the optimized control action to the corresponding BACnet objects. 3.2 Model identification A crucial element of the MPC framework is the prediction model that is the basis for the predictive controller. This study investigates the performance of two different types of model identification techniques, a non-linear grey-box (RC) and a linear ARX model. The models were identified using historical measurement data obtained from the BMS. The length of the used data set was 14 days, with a time-step of 1 min. For identification, the data sets were re-sampled to a time-step of 5 or 15 min. In addition, a cross-validation was used to test the performance of the prediction models when using a new input data set of 14 days. The identified models were used to predict the room temperature and indoor CO2-concentrations. The data-set for temperature prediction models included the following parameters: GHI ( Q s ), ventilation heating power ( Q v e n t ), ambient temperature ( T a ) and the internal temperature ( T i ). For the solar heat gains, the GHI is measured by the local weather station. The heating power for all-air systems is defined as the heating supplied by the system as shown in Eq. (1). The data-set for indoor CO2-concentration predictions included the measured room CO2-concentration, the airflow rate and the occupancy. The grey-box model was identified using the CTSM toolbox in R [48]. The identified model is a combination of a thermal model and a CO2-model and included 3 temperature states and one state for CO2, for each zone. (1) Q v e n t = V ̇ a i r ∗ ρ a i r ∗ c a i r ∗ ( T s u p p l y − T r o o m ) The second model used is an ARX model, these models describe the input effects u(t) on the output y(t). The general structure of an ARX model is expressed in Eq. (2): (2) y ( t ) = a 1 y ( t − 1 ) − ⋯ − a n a y ( t − n a ) + b 1 u ( t − n k ) + ⋯ + b n b u ( t − n b − n k + 1 ) + e ( t ) The one step ahead prediction was estimated using the least squares identification technique. Multiple step ahead predictions were estimated using the recursive least square method. The ARX model is data-driven and does not contain any physical parameters as opposed to the previously described grey-box model. The ARX model for room temperature identification was based on measurement data of indoor and outdoor temperature, GHI, internal heat gains and heating power. The ARX model for CO2 predictions was based on measurement data of CO2-concentration, occupancy and the airflow rate. T Both identified models are second order ARX models. The results of the model identification are summarized in Table 2. Fig. 5 illustrates the model and Table 3 gives the values for all the parameters present in the model as illustrated in Fig. 5. The identified 3 state grey-box model (Fig. 5) showed good performance regarding temperature predictions. A 5 step ahead prediction on a 15 min time interval showed an average root mean square error (RMSE) of approximately 0.60 ° C . The second order ARX model indicated similar results. However, the cross-validation demonstrated that the 3 state RC model outperformed the ARX model. The RMSE for the grey-box model is 0.20 ° C compared to 0.50 ° C for the ARX model. Regarding CO2 predictions, the ARX model indicated the best performance. For the one step ahead prediction (15 min), the error was 45 ppm compared to 55 ppm for the grey-box model. For a 5 step ahead prediction, the grey-box model indicated a better performance, with an error of 100 ppm compared to 150 ppm for the ARX model. The cross-validation indicated that the ARX model produced better results with a RMSE 65 ppm compared to 84 ppm for the grey-box model. 3.3 Optimization problem for the RC-NMPC The all-air MPC includes two controlled variables in the optimization problem: supply air temperature and airflow rate. As indicated in Eq. (1), these two parameters are multiplied to obtain the thermal ventilation energy supplied to the zone resulting in a non-linear constraint. Therefore, a NMPC was used to obtain these two parameters directly after the optimization problem was solved. The following quadratic cost function, shown in Eq. (3), was defined and solved for the complete prediction horizon (Hp) for each control time-step (k). A quadratic cost function provides better tracking of the solution and helps with stability at reduced computational effort [20,49]. The aim of the optimization problem is to minimize the energy use for both the fans and heating coils while maintaining thermal comfort and IAQ. Slack variables (zX) were added to an inequality constraint to soften the hard constraint by allowing variables to exceed the constraint. The slack variables zT and zCO2 were used for the thermal comfort and IAQ constraints respectively, in order to penalize set-point violations. A lower and upper bound was defined for the operative room temperature. The weighting factors (w1\u2013w4) for the comfort and energy parameters were chosen with use of a Pareto optimal front. The resulting optimization problem was solved for every control time-step. In each time-step the optimal control output was calculated for the complete prediction horizon using forecasts of the disturbances and measurements. The RC-NMPC controller uses a non-linear MPC, and is implemented by the JModelica Python interface [50]. The optimizer is based on the direct collocation algorithm to optimize the control output [51]. The solver that is selected for the optimization problem is MUMPS. (3) M i n ∑ k = 0 H p w 1 ∗ ( z C O 2 ) 2 + w 2 ∗ ( z T ) 2 + w 3 ∗ ( Q e l e c ) 2 + w 4 ∗ ( Q v e n t ) 2 Subject to: 3.4 Optimization problem for the ARX-MPC The ARX-MPC was split up into two steps: (1.) the CO2-MPC and (2.) the Temperature-MPC (Fig. 6). To avoid a non-linear approach, the CO2-MPC first calculates the minimal required airflow to control the indoor CO2-concentrations based on the following inputs: CO2-concentration in the room (current and previous time-step), occupancy, outdoor CO2-concentration. Maintaining the CO2-concentrations below the desired set-point has the highest priority in this control. As the ARX model is linear, the minimal required airflow for CO2 control can be optimized by the CO2-MPC. The associated cost function was depicted in Eq. (4). The ARX optimization problem was written in Python using CVXPY [52], which allows to solve convex optimization problems. The selected solver was OSQP [53], i.e. the default solver used in CVXPY to solve quadratic optimization problems. This solver is selected as it indicated significant time improvements for solving MPC problems [53]. The optimized airflow rate, derived from the CO2 MPC, was set as a minimum input constraint for the Temperature-MPC (Fig. 6). Afterwards, the Temperature-MPC was solved using the cost function shown in Eq. (5). The ventilation energy (Q v e n t ) is then optimized using the predictions for room temperature in this Temperature-MPC, based on the cost function as stated in Eq. (5). (4) C O 2 c o n t r o l : M i n ∑ k = 0 H p ( z C O 2 ) 2 + ( Q e l e c ) 2 Subject to: (5) T e m p e r a t u r e c o n t r o l : M i n ∑ k = 0 H p ( z T ) 2 + ( Q v e n t ) 2 Subject to: The final step in this ARX-MPC involved post-processing the results, to obtain the actual set-points for the supply air temperature and the ventilation rate ( V ̇ a i r ). This post-processing sets the optimized variable Q v e n t as input in Eq. (6) to obtain the optimized variables T s u p p l y and m a i r f l o w . The other input is the airflow rate that is obtained from the CO2-MPC. Afterwards, T s u p p l y can be calculated. If T s u p p l y is above or equal to 45 ° C , T s u p p l y is set to 45 ° C and the mass flow rate is increased. (6) V ̇ a i r = Q v e n t ρ a i r ⋅ c p ; a i r ⋅ ( T s u p p l y − T r o o m ) Subject to: 3.5 Implementation The weather forecast data was collected through a weather forecast API [54] to obtain hourly updated values of the outdoor temperature and the cloud-cover for the specific location (based on the latitude and longitude position). This API was selected as it provided hourly updated weather forecasts for the given location and allowed to make 1000 API calls a day for free. The GHI was calculated using the clear-sky scaling algorithm [55] that is present in the pvlib python package [56] and based on the cloud cover and global position. In addition, the forecast included the weekly lecture schedule to obtain the occupancy forecasts. Finally, the MPC framework was implemented in the case study building using the existing BACnet [57] interface of the AHU. To read and write control actions using the BACnet interface, a BACnet/IP driver was installed on the BECKHOFF C6930 industrial computer (IPC) using the Python package BACØ [58] that is built on top of BACpypes [59]. These Python packages implement a BACnet/IP driver combined with predefined functions to read and write actions to BACnet objects. The control actions were written on priority level 15 which is the lowest level of priority. To switch back to a RBC, the release of the BMS, present in the control interface of the AHU, can be deactivated. This ignores all the previously written set-points by the predictive controller. 3.6 Design of experiments The developed MPC framework was implemented in the case study building to evaluate and demonstrate the performance in a real-use environment. Table 4 presents the scenarios tested during the experiments. With exception of scenario A, the room heating temperature set-point was set to occupancy based, as it is likely to result in higher energy savings for heating. Since there is intermittent use, it is expected that an occupancy based heating set-point would be more beneficial for a predictive control, compared to a constant heating temperature set-point. The control strategy was tested during two different periods, March 2020 and September\u2013October 2020. A new MPC scenario was always activated on Friday evening at approximately 18:00 h prior to the tested week starting on Monday morning. The experiments were conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, the room capacity was reduced to 50% of the normal capacity (80 persons) during the first implementation period (scenario A and B). During the second period of tests (scenario C, D and E) class sizes were further reduced to 30 persons due to the COVID-19 restrictions. To compare the scenarios to the current RBC control a baseline period was selected from 3\u20139 November 2019. This period was selected as the occupancy hours and degree hours were similar to the period where the MPC was implemented. 3.7 Performance indicators To assess the performance of MPC regarding comfort, the following performance indicators are defined: thermal discomfort [Kh] and CO2 discomfort [ppmh]. To compare scenarios, the results for thermal discomfort were normalized using the heating degree days, and for CO2 discomfort using the occupancy hours. The method used to determine the heating degree days was based on the intermittent heating method described in CIBSE TM41 [60]. First the base temperature was calculated by Eq. (7) and afterwards the degree days were determined by Eq. (8). This adjusted base temperature was based on the internal and external heat gains, the overall building heat loss coefficient, and the time-constant of the building. The gain factor ( Q g ) was corrected by the utilization factor specified in EN ISO 52016-1 [61], that depends on the time-constant of the building and the intermittent use. (7) θ b = θ i ¯ − Q g U \u2032 where: (8) D d = ∑ ( θ b − θ o ) 24 where: Moreover, the aggregated energy use for the heating coils and the fans was compared for the tested scenarios in the final evaluation. 4 Results This section presents the results and the performance of the developed MPC framework after implementation in a case study building. First, the operation of the all-air system was demonstrated for one scenario and the prediction accuracy was analysed. Finally, the MPC scenarios were compared to a baseline RBC scenario to assess the performance regarding thermal comfort, IAQ and potential energy savings. 4.1 Weather forecast Implementing a predictive control in a building involves uncertainties that can be present in the forecasts for both the weather and occupancy. Fig. 7 illustrates the hourly weather forecast errors for the outdoor temperature and the GHI observed during March 2020. Large errors could be observed when using weather forecasts from existing applications. The solar radiation was especially sensitive, with large errors (300 W/m2) during days that were partly and completely cloudy. The mean bias error (MBE) found for GHI was 85 W/m2. For the outdoor temperatures, some errors between measured and predicted values reached 3 ° C , indicating the difficulty in forecasting this parameter accurately. Here the MBE found was 0.55 ° C . 4.2 Operation of the ventilation system Fig. 8 displays the measured and predicted data for the two lecture rooms during scenario B (ARX-MPC). The first graph of Fig. 8 presents for room 1 the measured VAV damper position, the expected occupancy schedule, and the measured CO2-concentrations. The second graph presents the supply air temperature, room temperature and the heating set-point in room 1. The third and fourth graph indicate the same respectively but for room 2. For room 1, on the second day (March 12), 70 occupants were expected during class 1. The VAVs open prior to the class at maximum position and stay at this position until the expected end of the class. While the VAVs are open the CO2-concentrations are approximately at 800 ppm lower than the acceptable threshold. Despite the occupancy schedule indicating no occupancy and the VAVs reacting accordingly by closing, the measured CO2-concentrations indicated a sharp peak at 1200 ppm. This was since in reality there was still students in the classroom. This shows that the actual start and end time of lectures can be different than what is expected. As for temperatures during that day, since the MPC was expecting occupants the room was preheated by increasing supply air temperatures up to 40 ° C for about an hour prior to occupancy. The MPC determines the preheating duration knowing that internal heat gains from occupants are expected in the future, and since the heating set-point (22 ° C ) was reached. On the last day, a class of 80 students was expected in the morning for room 1 (March 13). Therefore, the VAV damper was opened prior to start of the class to avoid a sharp increase in CO2-concentrations. However, the CO2 signal remained constant, which is why the VAV damper closed for the next control time-step. Comparison of the expected occupancy results to the actual measured CO2-concentration indicates that the class was cancelled. For temperature control, since a large group of 80 persons was expected, the supply air temperature set-point was lowered to compensate for the expected internal heat gains. However, as previously indicated, the class was cancelled, affecting thus the temperature control as no internal heat gains were registered. 4.3 Prediction error assessment Unexpected changes in occupancy occur and can have an impact on the performance of the implemented MPC. For example, for room 1 on the last day it is indicated that the heating set-point was not met during the morning class. The occupancy forecast indicates that 60\u201380 students were expected, however in reality the class was cancelled. To avoid a mismatch between measured and forecast of occupancy, currently the forecast of occupancy for the next time-step was replaced by the calculated value of occupants based on the current measurement of CO2 and the one-step ahead prediction of the CO2-concentration. For the remaining steps (2\u20138 step ahead) present in the prediction horizon, the occupancy forecasts were based on the lecture schedule. Overall, this results in a better forecast of the occupancy as indicated in Fig. 9. Here it is shown that using the corrected value of occupancy, the CO2 predictions showed smaller errors compared to the values predicted using only the lecture schedule and no feedback from the measurements. In some cases, the one step ahead prediction error using the lecture schedule resulted in a prediction error up to 1800 ppm, while with using the corrected value, the error is at maximum 300 ppm. For room temperature, it was shown that the highest frequencies were found for the smallest prediction errors in the range of −0.5 up to 0.5 ° C . The MBE observed for room temperature during this period was 0.17 ° C . 4.4 Thermal comfort and IAQ assessment To compare the different control strategies of each scenario, the achieved thermal comfort and IAQ was evaluated. Table 5 lists an overview of all the KPI\u2019s evaluated for each MPC scenario that was implemented. Highest thermal discomfort was noticed for scenario A with a maximum of 12.6 Kh. This could be the result of the constant heating set point that is used, combined with the highest heating degree-days compared to other scenarios. Furthermore, it can be seen that in scenario B, there was higher thermal discomfort compared to scenario D. However, this was a result of a fault in the AHU: air was trapped in the heating circuit during one day in the morning, resulting in a high thermal discomfort. The lowest thermal discomfort was shown for scenario D. The other discomfort indicator used is the CO2 discomfort. Here it is indicated that for scenario B, the CO2 discomfort was significantly higher compared to the other scenarios. The same was noticed for scenario D, where also the CO2 discomfort was relatively high for zone 1 with 998 ppmh. This could indicate that the ARX-MPC resulted in higher CO2 discomfort when compared to the RC-NMPC scenarios. Fig. 10 illustrates the normalized results for thermal and CO2 discomfort for all evaluated scenarios. The results indicated that the thermal discomfort for the RC-NMPC scenarios was generally higher compared to the ARX-MPC. However, absolute differences in thermal discomfort were small with a maximum of 4 Kh, with exception of scenario A. This indicated that both the ARX-MPC and the RC-NMPC can effectively control the indoor climate. Furthermore, it can be noticed that in zone 1, in general, the normalized thermal discomfort was lower compared to zone 2. Maximum normalized value for zone 1 was 0.14, while for zone 2 higher values were found. For the CO2 discomfort, more variance could be found for the normalized values. As indicated, the lowest CO2 discomfort was observed for scenario E with the 5 min time step. The shorter control time-step allows to respond faster to unexpected changes in occupancy. Highest CO2 discomfort is found for the ARX-MPC (scenario B), where it was indicated that the control allowed more violations. Although, it has to be noticed that the RC-NMPC did overestimate the zone CO2-concentrations resulting in over ventilating the rooms. This was attributed to fresh air entering the room through the door opening. The door to the hallway was opened frequently during classes allowing the zone air to mix with fresh air thus affecting the CO2 control. This door opening was observed during all tested scenarios affecting the operation of the balanced mechanical ventilation system. It is important to note that CO2 discomfort could also be attributed to high occupancy numbers. Since the capacity of the ventilation system is 2200 m3/h, with high occupancy numbers (over 50 persons), CO2 levels will easily exceed the set point of 1000 ppm, even at the maximum ventilation rate. This is of concern for scenario A and B, where larger classes took place compared to the second test period (scenario C, D and E), where class sizes were limited to 30 persons due to the COVID-19 measures. 4.5 Energy saving potential assessment To quantify the energy saving potential, the energy use was compared to a similar period during the heating season operating under a RBC strategy. Therefore, for scenario A and B, a baseline scenario from March 2019 was used and for the remaining MPC scenarios, a baseline scenario from October 2019. The heating energy use is then standardized using the degree-days. The resulting heating energy savings were indicated in Table 6. Scenario A indicated no heating energy savings and even an increase of heating energy use by 16%. Here the predictive controller activated the AHU earlier to meet the heating set-point of 22 ° C at 07:30 h, while for RBC the AHU was activated at 07:30 h and heating starts afterwards. This increases the heating energy use as there are more operating hours for the MPC compared to the RBC. With the remaining scenarios, an occupancy based heating set-point was used which improving the heating energy savings significantly. The savings range between 21.3%\u201354.7%. For fan energy savings, the energy use was normalized using the occupancy hours as the ventilation rate was mainly in function of the CO2-concentrations. Here it is indicated that the savings varied between 10%\u201339%, with an average heating energy saving of 25.6%. The low energy saving for scenario C was attributed by a class that took place after the normal operating hours of 07:30\u201318:00 h. Therefore, fan energy use increased compared to the baseline scenario. 5 Conclusion This study developed and implemented an MPC framework in a real educational building to demonstrate and evaluate the performance of different predictive control strategies for an all-air system. Through a weather forecast API and weekly lecture schedules, future values for internal and external disturbances were collected. The resulting optimized control action was written through the existing BACnet interface of the AHU. Two types of predictive models: ARX-MPC and RC-NMPC were used to analyse the effect of each model on the performance after implementation. The difference between the two models for the MPC framework was relatively small, indicating that both can be applied in a real environment. It is worth noting though that the ARX-model is a much simpler model regarding its structure, requiring less time to identify. Furthermore, the grey-box model requires more computation time than the ARX-model, since the RC-NMPC requires a non-linear solver while the ARX-MPC can be solved with a linear solver. Due to the parameter estimation, the grey-box model is more time intensive to identify compared to the ARX-model. However, when a suitable grey-box model was identified, the prediction accuracy towards temperature predictions is slightly better compared to an ARX-model. A limitation for both types of models was that the performance depended on the quality of the measurement data that was collected. For example, enough variation in outdoor temperature was required. The experiments demonstrated that room temperature and indoor CO2-concentrations could be predicted with a high accuracy. However, the uncertainties of disturbances could have an impact on the results of MPC resulting in a lower performance. The two MPC strategies proved that the indoor room temperatures and CO2-concentrations could be controlled by optimizing the system set-points. However, higher CO2 discomfort hours were noticed for the ARX-MPC scenarios. The IEQ is guaranteed using a cost function that minimizes both the room temperature and CO2 set-point violations while at the same time minimizing the energy use. The reduction of the control time-step from 15 min to 5 min resulted in a significant decrease of CO2 discomfort hours. To make a fair comparison, the normalized comfort results indicated the lowest CO2 discomfort for the 5 min control scenario. The shorter control time-step of 5 min resulted in a more accurate control of the IAQ inside the room, as the control can anticipate faster unexpected changes. However, the computation time did increase significantly as the number of time-steps in the prediction and control horizon increased from 8 to 24. The developed all-air MPC can cope better with the intermittent use of the space by using the forecasts of disturbances to optimize the control based on current measurements and future demand. In addition, an occupancy based heating set-point is the better choice when combined with a predictive control. During unoccupied hours, with an occupancy based heating set-point; the predictive control can optimize the heating and fresh air demands. When occupancy is expected, the predictive control anticipates in time by adjusting the supply air temperature prior to the start of a lecture. This results in a lower heating energy demand compared to a constant heating set-point or to a feedback control. The energy savings calculated for the implemented MPC strategies with an occupancy based heating set-point were 10%\u201340% for electric energy use and 21%\u201355% for thermal energy use. These ranges mainly depend on accuracy of the occupancy forecast. These results indicate that the combination of an MPC with an occupancy based heating set-point is more energy efficient for this type of building with intermittent use. However, it should be noted that the developed framework is still not transferable to other buildings and occupancy-types. In addition, longer measurements are needed to demonstrate the performance of MPC over longer time-frames. Not in all cases the application of MPC will result in energy savings. For example, scenario A displayed an additional 16% energy use due to the constant heating set-point. A limitation of this study is that it was not possible to operate a RBC and MPC simultaneously in the test environment. In a future study, the energy saving potential will be verified and quantified using a co-simulation study to compare RBC and MPC operating under the same conditions.

        "dc:description": "In educational buildings, the HVAC system is a major contributor to the total energy use. It is well-known that energy reductions could be achieved by more advanced control strategies for HVAC systems. A model predictive control (MPC) strategy could be a viable solution. Contrary to the standard rule based control (RBC), the predictive control can adjust in the supply air temperature, airflow rate prior to the start of a lecture. This study aims to develop and demonstrate an MPC framework for an all-air system that controls both the room temperature and the CO2-concentrations. To predict these variables two model identification techniques were compared: auto-regressive with exogenous input (ARX-MPC) linear model and a grey-box resistor\u2013capacitor nonlinear model (RC-NMPC). In addition, a cost function that minimized the energy use while guaranteeing thermal comfort and indoor air quality (IAQ) was formulated. This study showed that the ARX-MPC was preferred over the RC-NMPC given its simplicity. As for the model identification, the ARX model was less computationally time-consuming than the grey-box model. Furthermore, the RC-NMPC required more computational time than the ARX-MPC, since the RC-NMPC required a non-linear solver while the ARX-MPC used a linear one. The developed MPC framework was than implemented through BACnet in a real-use educational building to test its actual performance. The energy savings calculated for the implemented MPC strategies with an occupancy based heating set-point were respectively 10%\u201340% for electric energy use and 21%\u201355% for thermal energy use.",
