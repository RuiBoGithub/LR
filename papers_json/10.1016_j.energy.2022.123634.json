City University of Hong Kong, Tat Chee Ave, Kowloon, Hong Kong. City University of Hong Kong Tat Chee Ave Kowloon Hong Kong Driven by advances in smart grid technologies, building prosumers have closer interaction in sharing energy and information towards net-zero energy communities with energy flexibility and smart readiness. Many studies have focused on transactive energy systems, whereas limited attention was paid to coordinated prosumer management involving electric and electro-thermal energy storages. In this paper, a hierarchical energy management system was developed for a commercial neighbourhood, where distributed prosumers can share their generation and batteries, and manage cooling loads and thermal storages, in subtropical Hong Kong. Several operational scenarios were formulated considering building-level and neighbourhood-level controls, to explore the synergies through peer-to-peer (P2P) sharing and demand flexibility. Techno-economic-environmental impacts were analysed comprehensively from the perspectives of the network, the utility, and each participant. Results show that by integrating the demand-side flexibility, the P2P system could use electricity more effectively and economically. The formulated P2P operation strategy utilising neighbourhood-level control minimised the operational cost by 24.6% and net equivalent CO2 emission by 7.1%, compared to the traditional peer-to-grid operation. The profit for each participant can be allocated by regulating the compensating price in the dynamic internal trading. The study provides prosumers energy-flexible and grid-friendly operation to facilitate the sustainability of the smart grid.

The whole world is witnessing an unprecedented boom in renewable energies. Global renewable additions in 2020 rose by 45% to almost 280 GW, and China accounted for over 80% of the annual growth, reported by the International Energy Agency [1]. Feed-in Tariff (FiT) schemes have emerged as an incentive to promote the development of renewable energy systems (RESs) at individual premises. Influenced by dynamic weather conditions, renewable generation has the characteristics of intermittency, volatility, and randomness. To maintain the grid stability and avoid costly network investments, a microgrid is adopted as a unit of distributed energy management in order to facilitate local renewable integration [2]. In recent years, with the decline of FiT rates in many countries, building prosumers that can either act as an energy consumer or supplier have been motivated to participate in an energy exchange framework [3], which is regarded as a desirable pathway for transitioning from net-zero energy buildings towards grid-connected carbon-neutral communities [4]. The mechanism of peer-to-peer (P2P) energy sharing in distributed renewable systems is that nearby buildings explicitly share their surplus renewable energy with each other, so as to improve the renewable penetration and demand coverage. The energy sharing approach proposed in Ref. [3] could reduce the energy loss on the alternating current (AC) line by 60% without requiring large battery capacities. Electrochemical battery energy storage systems (BESSs) have also been incorporated in the sharing paradigms to help balance local production and consumption. Kusakana [5] studied P2P energy management between two photovoltaic (PV) prosumers with electrical storage and grid connection. The results demonstrated that, compared to the peer-to-grid (P2G) operation, the daily cost of the residential was reduced by 62.71% in summer and 68.99% in winter, while that of the commercial was reduced by 81.31% in summer and 31.69% in winter. Roberts et al. [6] developed a shared PV-BESS system for five apartment buildings. The results showed that the centralized battery storage could shave peak demand by 30%, increase self-sufficiency by 12%, and contribute to energy bill saving. Zhu et al. [7] proposed a distributed real-time sharing control algorithm with low complexity for a group of grid-connected households, who operated a shared energy storage system via a central coordinator cooperatively. It indicated that the proposed algorithm outperformed a greedy sharing algorithm for the distributed BESSs case in terms of RES utilisation and cost-saving. Also, electric vehicles (EVs) are utilised as flexible storage systems for energy sharing [8\u201310]. Barone et al. [8] analysed the role of EVs as electricity vector for energy exchange among buildings in a microgrid to reduce the grid reliance. The performance of different energy management and sharing schemes have been identified and investigated in many previous works, in terms of economic benefits [11,12], grid friendliness [8,13,14] and energy-matching indexes [6,9,15], etc. However, most of the studies that explore the P2P operation of distributed prosumers and consumers focus on energy sharing and trading after considering the availability of RESs or BESSs, without regard to demand-side management (DSM) in smart buildings [16]. Building energy loads can be managed by proactively controlling the operation of electrical appliances, lighting, heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems; thus, the synergistic effects of different DSM alternatives need to be discussed in the transactive energy systems. A majority of previous studies have investigated DSM strategies and demand response (DR) programs for individual residential and non-residential buildings [17], not energy-sharing communities with local transaction [18]. At an individual level, the flexibility is given by the modification in generation injection and consumption patterns in response to an external signal which is a load triggering signal or a price indication signal [19]. The energy flexibility provided by advanced grid-responsive strategies [20] and demand-side controllers [21] can effectively reduce the grid imports and operational costs. However, random and separate DSM of individual participants in microgrids may cause adverse effects on others\u2019 profits and the grid reliability like rebound peak issue [22]. Driven by advances in Information and Communication Technology (ICT), the active buildings can form a community, which enables the energy and information exchange locally [23]. In recent years, interactive energy management at large scales has been exploited to put less strain on the grid and reduce total costs [24]. Based on a time-of-use (TOU) pricing scheme, Timothée et al. [25] modelled the vehicle-to-grid (V2G) as flexible demands with restricted grid interactions and optimised the energy dispatch of a multi-energy hub which includes renewables, co-generation plants, thermal and electrical storages. Ramos et al. [26] managed the prosumers with heat pumps and PV modules in a district using different precooling strategies through a central controller. The results revealed that, by promoting energy sharing, the proposed control could improve the self-consumption and self-sufficiency ratios by 42% and 64%, respectively, and the cost-saving was highly dependent on the considered FiT. Dong et al. [27] proposed a decentralised control strategy to coordinate numerous thermal energy storage (TES) by iteratively updating their operational profiles until an equilibrium is reached for the households, which enables individual energy arbitrage and distribution network congestion management. To facilitate energy sharing, the design of business models is also crucial to distribute the monetary benefits and motivate the participation. A study on prosumer-based energy sharing and management approach for cooperative DSM indicated that the scheme is more useful in maintaining the overall prosumer satisfaction by imposing a suitable price control mechanism [28]. Some P2P energy sharing models have been proposed through stimulating energy dispatch, transaction, and demand response [29\u201331]. Zhou et al. [31] established a generic methodology to evaluate different P2P energy sharing models, including the bill sharing model, the mid-market rate (MMR) model [30] and the supply-demand ratio (SDR) model [29]. The results showed that the dynamic internal pricing model based on SDR achieved better economic performance than the other two models, but the studied models didn't consider the BESS at each user side. Long et al. [11] further developed a modified SDR-based pricing mechanism for PV-battery systems using a compensating price which ensures every customer be better off. Basically, the main driver for individual energy arbitrage under the static TOU pricing scheme is the difference in energy tariffs across various periods. Under the real-time electricity pricing scheme, the change in electricity consumption pattern motivated by the flexibility can reshape the electricity price, but small customers may not shift usage in response to price signals due to their slight impact. With the introduction of dynamic internal pricing mechanisms in P2P networks, this has become a particularly interesting problem for energy management, since different prosumers can control their generation, storages and flexible appliances to reshape the energy profiles for profit maximisation. In a decentral case, the household has full control over its storages, while in a central case, the flexibilities are fully managed to maximise the community benefit. Englberger et al. [18] compared the two decision making approaches in P2P networks with electric storages and indicated the central approach has the greatest profitability potential. However, the local electricity price is static which equals the midpoint of the difference between the electricity retailer's buying and selling prices. The coordination and negotiation techniques for managing demand-side flexibility in residential microgrids are reviewed in Ref. [32], involving multi-agent system (MAS) [33], optimisation [34] and game theory [35]. One challenge of MAS lies in the accurate modelling of the agents\u2019 behaviours [36]. Thus, the building models were usually oversimplified when considering DR in the P2P participation that they did not concern different building types and their thermal characteristics or system constraints. For instance, each prosumer was assumed to have a certain proportion of shiftable loads provided by electrical appliances in Ref. [29]. Nwulu et al. [37] proposed the game theory-based DR programs to ensure that the incentive offered to the customers was greater than the interruption cost for the utility. The cooperative game ensures each prosumer against losing the profit compared to playing alone, while profit allocation fairness needs to be considered by further exploiting the non-cooperative game [38]. Nevertheless, the integration of game theory and mathematical programming with complicated building energy modelling at large scales leads to the increase of computational complexity. Predictive rule-based control is necessary to be proposed for distributed energy systems as it is more straightforward to implement and also effective in real building operations [39]. With regard to urban energy systems, commercial buildings play an important role in providing energy flexibility and ancillary services. DR in commercial buildings is mainly carried out by thermostatically-controlled loads (TCL), HVAC units and energy storage systems [17]. Smart grids integrated heat pumps and TES enable both the electrification of heating/cooling and demand control. Based on the literature review from the perspectives of prosumer-based energy sharing and management with demand flexibility, several research gaps can be noted. Although lots of works have been conducted on the interconnection between distributed renewable generators and electrochemical batteries for performance improvements [11,12,40], few studies combine the electricity sharing system and demand-side controls through electro-thermal energy storage systems (ETES) considering the system constraints to cater the expected thermal and electrical demand of different prosumers. Furthermore, many P2P systems are operated with dispatch strategies which insufficiently utilise predictions about the energy demands and the availability of distributed energy systems, while prosumer-side controls can be managed cooperatively with the assistant of information exchange in the neighbourhood energy management system (NEMS). Decisions can be made based on the energy and data transaction in different ways. Thus, P2P energy sharing along with proper DSM should be investigated regarding multi-criteria performance. In addition, individual cost-saving potentials from building-level and neighbourhood-level DR under the dynamic internal pricing scheme have been rarely emphasized. In this study, the synergies between P2P participants within an energy-flexible neighbourhood in subtropical Hong Kong was explored, involving multiple commercial prosumers with BESS and ETES, effective demand-side controls, and predicted information exchange. Distributed renewables, flexible loads and energy storages in different buildings worked in coordination to improve local renewable penetration and grid independence. Several operation scenarios were formulated and compared, with building-level or neighbourhood-level demand controls during the renewables-battery sharing operation. A multi-criteria evaluation was conducted from the perspectives of the network, the utility grid, and each participant. The contributions of this study are threefold. \u2022 A coordinated energy management and sharing system was developed for a commercial neighbourhood, where distributed prosumers can share their RESs and batteries, and flexibly manage the thermal loads and electro-thermal storages. \u2022 Different decision-making frameworks for prosumer-side controls are compared based on the building-level and neighbourhood-level predictive information in the renewables-battery sharing operation, to obtain an optimal solution that benefits both the system and the grid. \u2022 Individual cost savings were investigated using the dynamic internal pricing mechanism with profit allocation fairness in the energy trading process incorporating DSM to encourage the prosumers' participation. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the operation strategies and trading framework for the NEMS and the assessment criteria. Section 3 demonstrates the system description and modelling. Section 4 discusses the simulation results. Section 5 gives the conclusions. 2 Methodology 2.1 Overview of coordinated neighbourhood energy management system The interactive energy system with renewable integration, battery storages, and renewables-storage sharing strategy can maximise local grid independence, based on our previous study [12]. In this study, a hierarchical distributed NEMS is further developed and investigated for the coordination of multiple active prosumers within an energy sharing network (ESN), as shown in Fig. 1 . Each prosumer is configured by the renewable system, battery, ETES system, and associated electricity and thermal demands. At the upper level of the control framework, a central controller (named Energy Sharing Coordinator) can manage the energy transaction and communicate with the building energy management system (BEMS) for each prosumer. Surplus renewable energy from Building A can firstly be used to supply the electricity demands in Building B or C, and then be stored in the battery of Building B or C. The detailed operation process for each prosumer in the ESN is depicted by Fig. 2 . The ESC also acts as an agent of the prosumers to trade with the utility grid when there is an electricity surplus/shortage in the whole system. At the lower level, the BEMS is adopted for the control of flexible demand, based on the short-term prediction of supply and demand or the control signals sent from the ESC. For the individual building-level control, buildings perform DSM by adjusting thermal energy load and storage based on their own energy prediction. For the neighbourhood-level control, the BEMS directly receive the signals from the ESC to control the flexible units, which avoids prosumer's privacy concern in the ESN. Especially, the ESC can make decisions based on the prediction of the electricity surplus/shortage before or after implementing the power sharing. Detailed decision-making approaches in different management scenarios will be described in Section 2.3. 2.2 Prosumer based energy sharing model To maximise the renewable penetration, both distributed RESs and BESSs can be shared with nearby buildings in the collaborative operation. When the prosumer has surplus power after considering the dynamic demand and production, it will be utilised to cover other's demands within the ESN, charge the shared batteries to the maximum state of charge (SOC), and then being exported to the utility grid in sequence. By contrast, when the prosumer has deficient power, the demand can be covered by purchasing the surplus renewable generation from other participants. Afterwards, if there is still a demand shortage, it can be covered by discharging the shared batteries to the lower limit of SOC, and then importing from the grid. The distributed batteries are operated based on the aggregated control rule that when there is surplus renewable energy in the neighbourhood after considering the demand coverage, the prosumers share the surplus energy by charging their batteries with the amount linearly proportional to the nominal storage capacity [11]. In this regard, the SOC of each battery will be maintained at the same level. The operation flow diagram of a P2P participant is shown in Fig. 2. The energy balance for the individual prosumer i at time t is indicated by (1) P R e , i t + P E S , i t + P i m p , i t = P L , i t + P b a t , i t + P e x p , i t + P l o s s , i t where P R e , i t and P L , i t are the power generation and electric power demand of prosumer i at time t, respectively. P E S , i t denotes the renewable power shared from other prosumers. P b a t , i t is the charging/discharging power to/from the user-owned battery. The positive value of P b a t , i t means the charging power, and the negative value means the discharging power. P i m p , i t and P e x p , i t are the import and export power from/to the grid, respectively. P l o s s , i t is the energy loss during the system operation. 2.3 Flexible energy management scenarios Table 1 lists six operation strategies proposed for the neighbourhood energy management system. In Case 1, the commercial prosumers operate independently under the conventional P2G network, as the reference case. The excess power will be stored in their own batteries before being exported to the grid. In Case 2, the prosumers participate in the P2P network for sharing both renewable energy and battery storage systems, as shown in Fig. 2, without considering demand-side control. With the integration of demand flexibility, cooling loads and chiller systems combined with TES are utilised as flexible resources for the commercial buildings in the cooling-dominated area, Hong Kong. The temperature setpoints of indoor air and TES tanks will be determined by control signals (CS), −1, 0, or +1, generated by different methods in the studied cases (Cases 3\u20136), while maintaining indoor thermal comfort at the acceptable level. Using the DR signals, the detailed control algorithms for the controlled items will be illustrated in Section 3.3. For reducing individual energy costs, the building-level demand control at each prosumer is considered for the P2G operation in Case 3 and the P2P operation in Case 4. The principle of the DR strategy in Cases 3 and 4 is to monitor indoor air temperature and dynamic temperatures in TES tanks, and regulate the temperature setpoints according to the predicted building energy demand and renewable generation. Each BEMS makes its own decision following the building-level control signal (called Sig1). If the prosumer produces renewable power lower than its demand at the current timestep, the CS = −1; otherwise, the CS = +1. In Case 5, the BEMS follows the group-level control signal (called Sig2) based on the local net demand within the neighbourhood (i.e., the difference between total demand and total renewable generation). The CS = −1 means the net demand is positive or the demand is higher than the renewable energy, and the CS = +1 means the net demand is negative or the demand is lower than the renewable energy. This control strategy indicates that the buildings operate cooperatively to mitigate the mismatch between local energy demand and supply. In Case 6, the BEMS follows the group-level control signal (called Sig3) according to the day-ahead predicted energy surplus or shortage within the P2P system after fully utilising the shared battery storage systems. When there will be excess energy exported to the grid from the neighbourhood, the CS = +1. Conversely, the CS = −1 when there will be an energy shortage. 2.4 Dynamic internal pricing mechanism In this study, a modified SDR-based dynamic pricing mechanism [11] is considered for the energy trading process. The net load for prosumer i at time t is defined by (2) N L i t = P L , i t − P R e , i t + P b a t , i t The total selling power (TSP), the total buying power (TBP) and the SDR at time t are described by Eqs. (3)\u2013(5). (3) T S P t = − ∑ i = 1 N N L i t , N L i t < 0 (4) T B P t = ∑ i = 1 N N L i t , N L i t ≥ 0 (5) S D R t = T S P t T B P t Based on the overall SDR, the internal selling and buying prices are defined as follows: (6) P r s e l l t = { ( λ s e l l t + β t ) ⋅ λ b u y t S D R t ⋅ ( λ b u y t − λ s e l l t − β t ) + ( λ s e l l t + β t ) , 0 ≤ S D R t ≤ 1 λ s e l l t + β t / S D R t , S D R t > 1 (7) P r b u y t = { P r s e l l t · S D R t + λ b u y t · ( 1 − S D R t ) , 0 ≤ S D R t ≤ 1 λ s e l l t + β t , S D R t > 1 where λ b u y t and λ s e l l t denote the TOU price of the utility grid and the export price, respectively. β t is the compensating factor to encourage surplus energy sharing and it is restricted by Eq. (8). (8) λ s e l l t ≤ β t ≤ λ b u y t The relationship between internal trading prices and SDR is illustrated in Fig. 3 . The internal trading price of building i at time t is defined as: (9) P r i t = f ( N L i t ) = { P r s e l l t , N L i t ≤ 0 P r b u y t , N L i t > 0 The energy bill for building i and total operational cost for the neigborhood are calculated by (10) N C i = ∑ t = 1 T P r i t × N L i t × τ (11) N C t o t a l = ∑ i = 1 n N C i where τ denotes the simulation time step. 2.5 System assessment criteria The overall self-consumption ratio (SCR) and self-sufficiency ratio (SSR) are used to quantitatively investigate local renewable penetration and load coverage. The SCR indicates the ratio between the renewable generation consumed in the building group (including the electric load and the energy used for charging batteries) and the total renewable production, while the SSR represents the proportion of total electric load covered by renewable production and the energy discharged from batteries. The ratios are calculated by (12) S C R = 1 − ∫ t = 1 T P e x p t d t ∫ t = 1 T P R e t d t (13) S S R = 1 − ∫ t = 1 T P i m p t d t ∫ t = 1 T P L t d t where P R e t and P L t are the total renewable generation and electric demand in the community at time t, respectively. P i m p t and P e x p t are the total import and export power from/to the grid at time t, respectively. The net equivalent carbon dioxide emission (ECE) is calculated by Eq. (14) to estimate the greenhouse gas equivalencies. (14) E C E = C E F × ( ∫ t = 1 T P i m p t d t − ∫ t = 1 T P e x p t d t ) where CEF denotes the CO2-equivalent emission factor. The emission factor of the electric grid is 0.71 kg CO2-e/kWh for the year 2020 [41]. 3 System description and modelling 3.1 Meteorological parameters and building information In this study, meteorological parameters, such as ambient temperature, solar irradiation, and wind velocity in Hong Kong, are used as the input data to estimate building energy demand and generation. Fig. 4 presents the hourly weather data accessed from the Meteonorm database [42]. Hong Kong experiences high temperature (19\u201335 °C) during summer (June to September) while the annual average temperature is 22.9 °C. This subtropical area can receive excellent solar radiation that varies from 0.0 to 1017.4 W/m2 over the year. Additionally, it is suited for harvesting wind energy as it belongs to the coastal region where the annual average and the maximum wind speeds are 5.1 and 15.0 m/s, respectively. The whole energy system involves three types of commercial buildings, i.e., a 20-floor office building, a 20-floor hotel building, and a 5-floor retail building. The multizone building models and associated HVAC system models are established on the TRNSYS simulation environment [43]. The detailed information about the buildings is listed in Table 2 . Typical consumption profiles and schedules of occupancy, lighting as well as equipment operation defined by the Hong Kong Building Energy Code (HKBEC) [44] are used to calculate internal heat gains from indoor occupants, lighting, and electrical appliances. The specifications of the building envelopes are designed according to the HKBEC. 3.2 HVAC system Each building has a mechanical constant-air-volume ventilation system with a heat recovery wheel. The efficiency of total heat recovery between fresh air and exhaust air is 75%. The infiltration rate is set to 0.29 ACH (air changes per hour). The control of air flow rates is not considered in this study. The ventilation system is installed with a total fresh air handling unit (FAHU) to supply air at a desired temperature and relative humidity. As the dehumidification can be provided by the central ventilation system, a supplementary space cooling system is designed only for sensible cooling of the conditioned space, and associated hydronic terminals can be supplied with chilled water at relatively higher temperature to improve the system efficiency [20]. For meeting the AHU cooling load and the space cooling load, each building is equipped with two separate chillers integrated with TES tanks, as shown in Fig. 5 . One air-cooled chiller is connected to the AHU cooling storage tank (ACT) to supply chilled water for the FAHU cooling. Combined with another air-cooled chiller, the space cooling storage tank (SCT) can supply chilled water to room terminals, i.e., fan coil units (FCU), for the space cooling. Based on the cooling loads in buildings, the capacities of the associated chillers and storage tanks are designed to guarantee the required supply temperatures. The parameters of the chillers and TES tanks are illustrated in Appendix A. The performance data of the selected chillers under different ambient temperatures and chilled water temperatures are shown in Fig. 18 (Appendix A). The total heating load in each building include both the FAHU heating load and the hot water heating load. Considering the heating demand in the high-rise hotel, a solar heating system integrated with an auxiliary electric heater is equipped for supplying 55 °C hot water. The solar collector is south-oriented with 20° tilted angle and has the area of 60 m2. The detailed configuration was described in our previous study [12]. Since the daily hot water consumptions are relatively quite low in the office and retail buildings, only electric heaters are used for heating load coverage. The total electricity demand in each building includes the power consumptions of lighting, electrical appliances, air-cooled chillers, ventilation fans, pumps, and electric heaters. 3.3 Demand-side control algorithms For the cooling energy system as shown in Fig. 5, the chiller system controller is ON if it was previously OFF and the temperature of storage tank is greater than the upper setpoint temperature ( T s e t , u p p e r A C T or T s e t , u p p e r S C T ), otherwise the controller is OFF. The controller is OFF if it was previous ON and the tank temperature is lower than the lower setpoint temperature ( T s e t , l o w e r A C T or T s e t , l o w e r S C T ). According to the cooling system requirement, it was designed that the ACT is set below 7 °C, while the SCT is set below 15 °C. Fig. 6 illustrates the control algorithms under different input signals introduced in Section 2.3. During the normal operation when the CS = 0, the lower temperature set points of ACT and SCT, i.e. T s e t , n o r m A C T and T s e t , n o r m S C T , are 5 °C and 13 °C, respectively. Meanwhile, the normal indoor temperature setpoint (i.e. T s e t , n o r m i n ) is 24 °C for cooling periods. When the CS = +1, it means that there is surplus power at the building/neighbourhood level. In this condition, the chillers are open, and the lower temperature setpoints will be changed to T s e t , m i n A C T and T s e t , m i n S C T , which are assumed to be 1 °C lower than T s e t , n o r m A C T and T s e t , n o r m S C T , respectively, to increase the thermal storage capacity. When the CS = −1, it means that there is deficient power at the building/neighbourhood level. The indoor air temperature will be set at the maximum acceptable value (i.e., 26 °C), and the internal shading mode is open for decreasing the cooling load. The internal shading is set to 0.5. The lower temperature setpoints of the storage tanks will be modulated to T s e t , m a x A C T and T s e t , m a x S C T , which are assumed to be 1 °C higher than T s e t , n o r m A C T and T s e t , n o r m S C T , respectively, to reduce power consumption. 3.4 Renewable generation Both PV solar systems and wind turbines can be utilised for clean power production in Hong Kong. Using local weather data, Type 567 in TRNSYS was chosen to simulate the generation of building integrated photovoltaics (BIPVs) with monocrystalline silicon modules. The solar power output can be estimated by (15) P P V = Area P V × ( τ α ) n × I A M × G T × η P V where Area P V is the PV surface area; ( τ α ) n is the transmittance-absorptance product of the PV cover at normal incidence; I A M is the combined incidence angle modifier; G T is the total solar radiation incident on the PV surface; and η P V is the PV efficiency. In addition, the dynamic power production of rooftop thin film solar panel is simulated by Type 190c with maximum power point tracking. The model employs a \u201cfive-parameter\u201d equivalent circuit [45]. These parameters can be generated from commonly available data by the Engineering Equation Solver [48]. The wind power generation is estimated using Type 90 in TRNSYS. The detailed parameters for the BIPVs and wind turbine models are listed in Table 6, Appendix A. The shadowing effect of nearby structures or buildings is not taken into consideration in this study. 3.5 Electrochemical battery storage The SOC of the battery storage is estimated and constrained by (16) S O C t + 1 = S O C t + Δ t C A P b a t × [ P b c t × η b c − P b d t / η b d ] (17) S O C m i n ≤ S O C t ≤ S O C m a x where C A P b a t is the storage capacity; P b c t and P b d t is the power delivering to and absorbing from the battery, respectively; η b c and η b d is the charging/discharging efficiency of battery. In this study, the efficiency was set as 0.9. To prevent battery degradation and extend the service life, the allowable minimum and maximum SOC were 0.3 and 0.9, respectively. 4 Results and discussion The effects of the proposed sharing operation and management strategies were discussed in this section on the aspects of grid friendliness, load coverage and renewable penetration. Also, the economic analysis was conducted from the perspectives of the whole system and individual buildings, in different studied cases. The simulation timestep was 30 min. 4.1 Basic energy use and renewable generations Based on the models in Section 3 and the weather data of Hong Kong [42], the energy demand and generation of the studied prosumers were estimated. The annual energy consumptions of the office, hotel and retail buildings were 158.5, 182.6 and 168.9 kWh/m2·a, respectively, in the reference case (Case 1). Fig. 7 demonstrates the basic power demand during a typical week in July (from Monday to Sunday), including cooling, heating, and electric loads. As shown in Fig. 7, total electric power demand includes the power consumptions of the lighting, electrical appliances, ventilation fans, chillers for both FAHU cooling and space cooling, electric heaters for heating load coverage, and pump system. Note that the power consumption of the variable speed pump on the demand side was determined by the associated cooling load and the temperature difference between supply and return water. The specific fan power of supply fan and exhaust fan in the ventilation system is assumed to be 800 W/(m3/s). The differences in their energy demand patterns were mainly caused by associated operating schedules. The flat curve in 144\u2013168 h in Fig. 7 (a) is because the air conditioning system in the office building stops working on Sunday. The water heating demand in the hotel was much higher than the heating demands in the office and retail buildings due to the larger amount of hot water required. The BIPVs were installed on the four vertical facades of the buildings, fully utilising the envelope except the windows area. Both the high-rise hotel and the office building were equipped with 3560 m2 BIPVs (rated capacity at 534 kW). In addition, a 0.3-MW wind turbine was designed for each high-rise building so that the annual production of the hybrid renewable system could almost meet annual building energy use. The annual renewable generation for the hotel or office building was 1.49 × 106 kWh. The capacity of individual batteries was 500 kWh. The retail building was equipped with 890 m2 BIPVs (rated capacity at 133.5 kW) and 800 m2 rooftop PV panel (rated capacity at 112 kW) facing south with 22° tilted angle. The total annual solar energy generation was 1.82 × 105 kWh. The annual solar energy outputs per unit area were 52.2, 79.4, 81.1, 79.7 kWh/m2, respectively, in terms of facing north, east, south, and west, while the annual energy generated by the rooftop PV panel per area is 147.8 kWh/m2. The retail building was equipped with a 200-kWh battery. Fig. 8 shows the dynamic power generation of wind turbine and PV panels with different orientations during the summer week. The PV power production is mainly influenced by the cell temperature and the incident solar radiation. As shown in Fig. 8, during the early morning, the east-facing panels receiving more solar radiation usually produce more power than the west-facing panels. The hybrid solar-wind system designed for the office and hotel buildings produced much more renewable energy than the solar system for the retail building. The retail building can represent a small-scale prosumer that has little surplus energy in the whole system. The mismatch between productions and demands on their premises provides the possibility for the P2P operation. 4.2 Implementation of energy sharing model 4.2.1 Electricity imports/exports Fig. 9 demonstrates the dynamic imported power of the neighbourhood from the grid throughout the year in Cases 1 and 2, to present the effectiveness of P2P operation. The electricity required by the neighbourhood from June to September accounts for over 40% of annual energy imports, and the effects of the proposed DSM strategies will be discussed focusing on this period in Section 4.4. Compared to the P2G operation, the formulated energy sharing can reduce the stress on the grid, especially from 8:00 to 22:00, indicated by the curves with lighter colours in Fig. 9(b). The P2P operation decreased the annual grid importation by 23.6%, from 1.52 × 106 kWh to 1.16 × 106 kWh, which leads to the enhancement of self-sufficiency from 0.564 to 0.667, although the value of peak import power is the same as the reference case (at 732.9 kW). Fig. 10 presents the power exporting to the utility grid from the whole system. Compared to the separate operation in Case 1, the annual peak export power decreased from 779.8 to 702.9 kW in Case 2. The P2P operation in Case 2 decreased the annual grid exportation by 36.0%, from 9.97 × 105 kWh to 6.38 × 105 kWh. The proposed sharing model has significant effects on reducing the electricity exports, particularly when the three buildings operate together, and contributes to improving the SCR from 0.685 to 0.798. 4.2.2 Annual saving potentials With the implementation of P2P operation, the annual operational cost was declined by 22.6%, from 1.37 × 106 HKD (1.75 × 105 USD) to 1.06 × 106 HKD (1.35 × 105 USD). The individual cost-saving potentials are compared in Fig. 11 , by varying the compensating factor. With the compensating factor changed from 0 to 0.6, the energy bill savings of the office and hotel buildings increased by 35.9% and 21.7%, respectively. The difference in the increment is mainly because the office building shared more energy with others than the hotel. By contrast, the retail building's energy bill saving got a 30.3% reduction when the compensating factor varied from 0 to 0.6, since the retail building with insufficient renewable generation often acts as a consumer in this sharing system. The total bill reduction was maintained at the same level, as the demand profiles and the generation were unchanged. The results indicate that the compensating factor can reflect the distribution of economic profits among different prosumers. 4.3 Comparison of energy management strategies Since the benefits obtained from the proposed energy sharing operation at the neighbourhood level have been explored above, the effectiveness of demand-side control strategies will be emphasized in this section. Different energy management scenarios for implementing the control algorithms in Section 3.3 were described in Section 2.3. 4.3.1 Energy demands Fig. 12 shows the variation in electricity demand caused by different energy management strategies in one day as an example. Compared to the basic demand (shown in orange), when the total energy use is lower than the total generation, the building-level demand response may have different influence on total energy use during different times. For instance, the controller using individual signals (Sig1) increased the total energy consumption during 1:00\u20135:00 but decreased the total energy consumption during 10:00\u201316:00, caused by the differences between their own demand and supply. As expected, the control responds to neighbourhood demand-supply signal (Sig2) diminished the total energy use when the energy use is higher than the production and increased it when the production is higher. Compared with the reference demand, the peak demand shifted from the time of higher demand (17:00) to the time of higher production (16:00), and it decreased to 747.6 kW by using Sig2, while the peak demand still occurred at 17:00 and had a significant decline from 760.6 kW to 706.9 kW, by using Sig1. According to Fig. 12, the demand response using neighbourhood surplus-shortage signal (Sig3) also helps reduce the mismatch between demand and generation. The difference is that the demand under this control strategy during 5:30\u20139:00 was closer to the normal demand, because the surplus-shortage signal (Sig3) was further influenced by the SOC of the battery storage system. 4.3.2 Grid interaction Fig. 13 presents the power exchanges between the neighbourhood and the grid on July 23 in each case. The positive value means the imported power, while the negative value means the exported power. Compared to the separate operation in Case 1, there is a significant reduction in electricity imports and exports by implementing the P2P energy sharing. However, the peak load of the grid increased to 524.5 kW at 21:00 for the ESN without demand response (Case 2), compared with the reference peak load at 465.9 kW in Case 1. The underlying mechanism is that the surplus energy was fully shared within the neighbourhood during the daytime, thus the shared batteries already reached the lower limit of SOC at 20:00. The P2G system together with the individual building-level control in Case 3 decreased the grid importation but it may lead to more electricity exports sometimes. Through integrating the formulated demand response strategies, the P2P sharing system could behave much better with regard to the grid friendliness. As shown in Fig. 13, the energy exchanges with the grid were diminished dramatically during the on-peak hours in Case 5. Compared with Case 2, the amount of electricity imported from the grid reduced by 23.7%, 23.1%, and 14.3% in Case 4\u20136, respectively. Such decline in power imports in Case 4 contributed to 54.2% more cost savings than the P2P operation without demand control (i.e., Case 2) on July 23 (see the first day in Fig. 14 ), compared with Case 1. 4.3.3 Economic bills With reference to the electricity tariffs for commercial buildings, the import price was defined as 1.1 HKD/kWh (0.141 USD/kWh) in the on-peak hours (9:00\u201321:00) and 0.9 HKD/kWh (0.115 USD/kWh) in the off-peak hours (1:00\u20139:00, 21:00\u201324:00). The export price was set as 0.2 HKD/kWh (0.026 USD/kWh) considering the grid stress caused by the exported energy [13]. The internal price should be bounded between the export price and the import price of the utility grid. The daily operational costs for the whole system from July 23 to July 29 are compared in Fig. 14. Combined with the daily energy demand and generation in Figs. 7 and 8, it can be noted that, when there is a larger diversity in the demand/supply profiles within the building cluster, the implementation of energy sharing in Case 2 is more economically viable. On the other hand, when the total supply is insufficient for the building demands, the adoption of individual demand response in the P2G system (Case 3) has more cost-saving potentials than implementing the energy sharing (Case 2), compared with the reference case. In general, the P2P sharing integrated with demand response strategies brings more economic benefits. The individual demand control strategy in Case 4 reduced the total energy cost on July 23 maximally by 74.6%, while the group-level control strategy in Case 5 reduced the cost of July 25 by 26.1%, and the surplus-shortage signal in Case 6 led to a maximum reduction in the cost of July 24 by 17.0%. This is because the economic performance of these operation strategies is not only influenced by each prosumers\u2019 daily demand/supply profiles, but the available storage capacity of the shared batteries at the beginning of the day. With regards to the long-term benefits brought by the DSM in the P2P operation, the performance under the formulated DR strategies will be further estimated for the whole cooling period in Section 4.4, to determine the most effective solution. 4.4 Synergistic effects of energy sharing network and demand control In this section, the synergistic effects of ESN and DR in summer are comprehensively evaluated, from perspectives of load matching, grid interaction (LMGI), environmental and economic performance. Table 3 presents the multi-criteria performance during the studied period for each case. 4.4.1 Neighbourhood-level performance Fig. 15 shows the impact of the formulated operation strategies on grid interaction. The energy imports and exports were 6.18 × 105 and 2.75 × 105 kWh, respectively, in the reference case (Case 1). The participation in the proposed energy sharing system in Case 2 leads to a 19.5% reduction in the grid importation and a 43.4% reduction in the grid exportation. As shown in Fig. 15, the grid stress can be further alleviated with the implementation of demand-side control algorithms. The building-level control signal in Case 4 can reduce the imported and exported energy by 24.3% and 47.0%. The imports and exports under the cluster-level control signal in Case 5 were declined to 4.56 × 105 and 1.38 × 105 kWh by 26.2% and 50.0%, respectively. This is mainly because the higher-level control signal is more effective in improving the overall grid dependence. Compared to Case 5, the grid importation and exportation were slightly increased in Case 6 due to higher energy consumptions. Fig. 16 shows the impact of the formulated operation strategies on total energy consumption and net equivalent CO2 emission. For the independent operation without energy sharing and demand response in Case 1, the total energy demand was 1.29 × 106 kWh. The overall self-sufficiency and self-consumption were 0.522 and 0.730, respectively, as shown in Table 3. This indicates that 73.1% of local renewable production was self-consumed for the demand coverage and the battery charging, and 55.2% of the demand was covered by the renewable energy. The operation in Case 2 didn't influence the total energy demand, compared to Case 1. Nevertheless, due to the participation in the energy sharing, the local self-consumption received a significant increase to 0.847, and the self-sufficiency was increased to 0.615, as listed in Table 3. Although the total demands in Cases 4\u20136 were only decreased by 1.5\u20131.7% after utilising demand-side flexibility, the SSR was increased by 21.3\u201322.8%, compared with Case 1, mainly because of the over 20% reduction in grid importation (shown in Fig. 15). As displayed in Fig. 16, compared to the conventional P2G operation, the net equivalent CO2 emission only decreased by 0.2% in the peer-to-peer system without DR (Case 2), whereas the P2P operation utilising the information of total net demand in Case 5 minimised the net equivalent CO2 emission by 7.1% from 2.43 × 105 k to 2.26 × 105 kg. The main reason for the inferior environmental performance in Case 6 than Case 5 is that the control based on the predicted surplus power after battery charging leads to more energy stored and lost in the BESS. In addition, as shown in Table 3, the total operational cost under the P2G network in Case 1 was 5.81 × 105 HKD (7.44 × 104 USD) in the summertime. In Cases 4\u20136, the overall cost decreased by 22.9%, 24.6% and 24.2%, respectively. Therefore, the operation strategy adopted in Case 5 is the optimum solution for improving the overall renewable penetration, lowering carbon emissions, and saving total operational cost of the renewables-storage sharing network. 4.4.2 Building-level performance Fig. 17 depicts the individual bill saving with respect to different DR strategies and compensating factors (CFs) in the P2P system. When the CF was set at 0, the internal selling and buying prices are equal to the electricity price sold to the grid if the supply-demand ratio is over 1. Compared to the P2G operation, the energy costs of the office and hotel buildings were only decreased by 5.1% and 2.4%, respectively, whereas there was a significant bill reduction of 36.6% for retail building, in P2P operation. As a small prosumer, the retail building gained much more profits in this circumstance due to the favourable purchase of surplus energy from the other prosumers. The demand response strategy in Case 5 further increased the bill saving percentage to 14.6%, 10.5%, and 40.5% for the three buildings, respectively. With the CF increases, there is a noticeable growth in the cost-saving potentials for the office and hotel buildings. When the CF was 0.3, among these P2P operation strategies, all the buildings could achieve the maximum economic benefits by implementing the DR strategy in Case 5. However, when the CF increases to 0.6, the optimum strategy is different from the perspectives of each participant. As shown in Fig. 17, the office building obtained more benefits under the DR strategy in Case 6, while the DR operation in Case 4 is the most economical one to the retail building. The reason for the maximum reduction of the office building's cost in Case 6 when the CF was 0.6 is that, as a larger prosumer, it prefers to consider the sharing operation constraints first rather than reshape demand, and thus it can sell more surplus energy to others when the internal price is relatively high. From the view of the retail building, the individual demand response without higher-level information exchange in Case 4 leads to a higher reduction in the energy consumption and electricity expenditure as the small prosumer's electrical demand couldn't be covered by its PV generation most of the time. 5 Conclusions In this study, an interactive neighbourhood energy management system was developed for multiple commercial prosumers with hybrid energy storages in Hong Kong, involving flexible demand-side controls, renewables-battery sharing and predicted information exchange. Multi-energy demands and storages in three buildings worked in coordination to improve local renewable penetration and grid independence. Several operation scenarios were formulated and compared for the NEMS, incorporating different demand-side controls based on individual building-level and neighbourhood-level information. A multi-criteria performance was estimated from different stakeholders\u2019 perspectives. The study can provide frontier guidelines for the transition from low-carbon buildings to grid-friendly energy communities and the development of interactive energy systems in subtropical, tropical and coastal areas, such as Singapore and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (cooling-dominated regions with abundant solar and wind energy resources). The main conclusions are summarized as follows. (1) By utilising the complementary energy resources and diverse electricity demands of different buildings, the renewables-battery sharing operation without DSM (Case 2) increased the overall self-consumption from 0.685 to 0.798 and reduced annual operational cost by 22.6% for the neighbourhood, with only a slight decrease of 0.2% in the net equivalent CO2 emission, compared to the traditional P2G operation. However, the daily peak load for the grid may be increased in Case 2 when all the distributed batteries reach the minimum SOC due to the storage sharing. (2) The energy flexibility provided by demand-side control strategies in Cases 4\u20136 is effective in further enhancing the grid friendliness in the P2P system. Compared with Case 1, the peak demand could be decreased and shifted from the time of higher demand towards the time of higher production by integrating the formulated control strategies. Such demand reshaping helps the P2P sharing system behave much better in the technical and economic aspects. (3) The exchange of the neighbourhood-level predicted information (net demand) in Case 5 is the optimum solution for the commercial system in terms of grid independence, renewable penetration, economic and environmental benefits. Compared with Case 1, the self-sufficiency was increased by 21.3\u201322.8% after controlling the flexible AC loads and thermal storages during the energy sharing operation in Cases 4\u20136, although the total demands in the summertime were only decreased by 1.5\u20131.7%. Among these formulated strategies, the demand control in Case 5 minimised the net equivalent CO2 emission by 7.1% and the total energy cost by 24.6%. (4) The internal trading model should be properly designed considering distributed flexible resources to ensure the participants' interests. The individual cost savings are influenced by the demand/supply profiles, user-side controls, and dynamic trading prices. For the P2P system with multiple prosumers, the compensating factor can be designated for improving the fairness of the SDR-based business model. The energy sharing microgrid helps improve the grid stability by gathering a combination of generation units, flexible loads, and energy storage elements at distribution level into a locally controllable grid-connected system. P2P participants should be willing to adjust their energy consumption by either reducing or increasing their power consumption to stabilize the grid and save costs. Advanced Information and digital technologies can also assist the reliable bidirectional communication among the coordinator and prosumers. Meanwhile, the integration of BESS is a valid solution to mitigate the mismatch between demand and supply. Considering the negative effects caused by the intermittent and uncertain generation of distributed generators, the shared BESS implements the rule-based control approach, which aims at storing the excess renewable production, and reusing it when the power demand exceeds the generation within the ESN. Besides, to remain stable for the power grid, it needs to respond to volatility in voltage and frequency disturbances. For example, in the case that more power is produced than consumed or more energy imported from the grid than exported, complete adjustments are necessary within an acceptable timeframe to balance the disturbances and power outages. Challenges to frequency and voltage stability with renewable integration have been discussed in Ref. [46]. The study takes advantage of managing distributed multi-energy systems with spatiotemporal complementarity and flexibility. The analysis of the abovementioned performance improvement potentials over multiple building characteristics gives an insight into the flexible P2P operation and influencing parameters from the technical, environmental, and economic perspectives. The methodology can be scalable and viable for the promotion of low-carbon communities or districts. Both residential and non-residential buildings can be involved in the coordinated energy management with novel P2P trading models in our future works. Considering the intermittent production and stochastic energy demand, robust optimisation can be further conducted for distributed renewable systems and storage units under the proposed control framework.

        "dc:description": "Driven by advances in smart grid technologies, building prosumers have closer interaction in sharing energy and information towards net-zero energy communities with energy flexibility and smart readiness. Many studies have focused on transactive energy systems, whereas limited attention was paid to coordinated prosumer management involving electric and electro-thermal energy storages. In this paper, a hierarchical energy management system was developed for a commercial neighbourhood, where distributed prosumers can share their generation and batteries, and manage cooling loads and thermal storages, in subtropical Hong Kong. Several operational scenarios were formulated considering building-level and neighbourhood-level controls, to explore the synergies through peer-to-peer (P2P) sharing and demand flexibility. Techno-economic-environmental impacts were analysed comprehensively from the perspectives of the network, the utility, and each participant. Results show that by integrating the demand-side flexibility, the P2P system could use electricity more effectively and economically. The formulated P2P operation strategy utilising neighbourhood-level control minimised the operational cost by 24.6% and net equivalent CO2 emission by 7.1%, compared to the traditional peer-to-grid operation. The profit for each participant can be allocated by regulating the compensating price in the dynamic internal trading. The study provides prosumers energy-flexible and grid-friendly operation to facilitate the sustainability of the smart grid.",
