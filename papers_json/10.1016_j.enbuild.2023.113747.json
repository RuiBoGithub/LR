Fig. 1 Flowchart of the Energy Performance Gap (EPG) design methodology. Fig. 2 (a) Location of the investigated case study building, and its (b) 3D model and (c) floor plan. Fig. 3 The Ambient Weather WS-2000 device on the roof of the apartment building. Fig. 4 Monthly gas bills of last three years for the four residential apartment units. Fig. 5 The heating gap analysis for the four residential apartment units. Fig. 6 Heat loss from (a) between blocks, and (b) at construction junctions with an infrared camera - FLIR i5 series. Fig. 7 Simulated and measured temperatures for the four residential apartment units. Table 1 The Energy Performance Gap (EPG) causes and solutions in the design stage. The causes that affect the design stage EPG reduction solutions 1. The inaccuracies in the inputs and assumptions utilized for building energy simulations [15]. (a) Inappropriate initial standard assumptions, such as the internal temperature of each space [36].(b) Improper modeling of building facade elements, the U-Value of exterior walls and roof, which may change during the construction stage [37], 25]. (a) Using reliable sources can help minimize inaccuracies in inputs and assumptions for building energy modeling, resulting in a reduction of the EPG [14].(b) The EPG can be reduced through changes in the simulation input data of certifications [38].(c) The engineers should consider experiences achieved in previous projects for the inputs of simulations [14]. Therefore, providing design and construction teams with long-term participation and performance responsibility is an effective approach to reduce the performance gap [20].(d) Calibration and validation of the input data [39] 2. The inaccuracy of climate data [33]. (a) In most cases, the climate files utilized in the simulation process are not suitable for evaluating the influence of climate change on the EPG [40]. This limitation arises from the scarce availability of climate files, mainly confined to specific locations such as airports, which are frequently located far from city centers and residential areas [41].(b) Uncertainty in defining the actual external environmental conditions [42].The uncertainty in determining future climate scenarios [43]. To improve accuracy, it is important to incorporate more precise climate data and establish a better-defined initial condition for the building [41]. 3. The inaccuracy of occupant behavior modeling [34]. The standards consider the same and fixed assumptions about the occupancy schedule [18] and occupants\u2019 behavior [16], which leads to ignoring the variety of the occupants\u2019 comfort needs [44] and thus affects the inaccuracy of the occupant behavior modeling. Taking into account the input and viewpoints of the building's future occupants [45]. Table 2 The Energy Performance Gap (EPG) causes and solutions in the operation stage. The causes that affect the operation stage EPG reduction solutions 1. Malfunctioning equipment [17]. (a) A technical problem in the building [14,18].(b) Failure of the energy system [46].(c) Lack of fine-tuning at the operation stage [47] (d) Control strategies that fail to work as expected [48]. (a) Planning to maintain building systems [49].(b) The building manager should establish a monitoring strategy [49].(c) Choosing suitable systems for the use of the building can reduce technical problems [50].(d) Implementing a network of sensors and alarms to identify system faults can effectively minimize technical issues and equipment malfunctions [24]. 2. Execution of the work [21,22]. (a) Construction quality, particularly when it comes to insulation and air leaks, poses a challenge to its accurate assessment [14].(b) The problem is impacted by the choice of materials and the competence of contractors since they are ultimately accountable for implementing plans and technical solutions during construction [14].(d) The poor building envelope quality [11] (e) Poor workmanship [19] (f) Lack of attention to the execution capability of the construction [51]. (a) By employing experienced personnel [14], implementing quality control measures [52], and fostering collaboration among all project stakeholders [9,53], it is possible to monitor and manage construction quality, ultimately resulting in a decrease in the EPG.(b) Providing strategies for training the operation workforce [54]. 3. Non-optimal use of the building by occupants [36] (a) The behavior of occupants regarding actions such as opening windows, using shades, artificial lighting [55], and indoor temperature setpoint has a considerable impact on the EPG [14].(b) The EPG is substantially influenced by the occupants' level of knowledge and experience in utilizing the installed technology [47].(c) Building characteristics such as insulation level [21,56], social [57] and personal characteristics of occupants such as lifestyle and cultural background, personal views of residents such as thermal comfort [50], and environmental concerns affect how occupants use it [8]. (a) By considering occupants' feedback and opinions [58] and evaluating their satisfaction, occupants will use the building optimally [41].(b) Informing occupants about behaviors that affect energy consumption [47] to increase residents' awareness [55].

The Energy Performance Gap (EPG) in buildings is a recognized phenomenon. However, its definition and underlying factors are extensive, necessitating a thorough investigation of the quantitative impact of each factor contributing to the EPG. In this research, a calibration-based approach is employed to identify and measure the contribution of these factors. Questionnaires, measurements, analyses, and calibrations are conducted on the energy performance of four residential units of an apartment block building in Iran as a case study. Subsequently, the impact rates of three key causes of the EPG, namely heating system efficiency, weather data in an EnergyPlus Weather (EPW) format file, and occupant behavior, are determined. By incorporating these causes into the model calibration process, the disparities between the design and operation stages are decreased. The study highlights the significance and quantifiable effects of accurate and measured boiler efficiency, utilizing a genuine EPW file rather than a convenient EPW file e.g., airport stations, and adopting precise and adaptable assumptions for occupant behavior modeling in bridging the EPG between the design and operation stages. There are a number of factors that impact the design stage gap, including boiler efficiency, occupant behavior, and a corrected EPW file, which contribute 43.9%, 26%, and 6.6%, respectively.

It is projected that global energy consumption and CO2 emissions will continue to rise until 2050, mainly due to population growth and economic development [2]. Several factors influence building energy consumption, including climate conditions, the building envelope, occupant behavior, building operation and maintenance practices, indoor environmental quality (IEQ), and building energy systems [3]. The total gas and electricity consumptions in the domestic section of Iran were reported about 350 kWh/m2 and 100 kWh/m2, respectively [4]. Given the escalating global energy consumption and its detrimental impact on global warming, it is imperative to prioritize the reduction of energy consumption and address the gap in the energy performance in buildings [5]. Also, the climate scenario shows a necessary transition towards long-term decarbonization and the essential objectives in energy efficiency [6]. To curb the alarming rise in building energy consumption, numerous governments have established targets for reducing building energy efficiency [7]. Consequently, it is essential for building owners and designers to adhere to these government-set specifications and standards when defining their energy consumption targets [8]. However, it is challenging and inaccurate to estimate consumption at the design stage before operation due to a phenomenon called Energy Performance Gap (EPG) [9]. Improving building simulation techniques and constructing reliable, high-performance buildings necessitate a comprehensive understanding of actual energy usage [7]. The energy performance of a building is significantly influenced by its features, making it crucial for building owners, designers, facility managers, and public authorities to understand this impact during the early stages of design [10]. Consequently, numerous studies have focused on assessing and improving building energy use [11]. In an analysis of 100 LEED-certified buildings, Newsham et al., [12] found that only 18 to 39 % of the buildings demonstrated low energy usage, indicating a weak correlation between standards and overall energy performance. Despite being designed to be energy-efficient, certified buildings often perform differently during the operational stage. As a matter of fact, the energy performance predicted at the design stage is rarely consistent with the actual measured performance [11]. During the design stage, building designers employ energy simulations based on building rating systems to enhance energy performance and decrease energy consumption [13]. These simulations assist designers in identifying energy-saving potentials and evaluating building performance [9], so it is important to have more accurate simulations. However, it is common for the energy consumption during the operational stage to differ from the simulation results obtained during the design stage. The term used to describe this difference is EPG, which stands for the additional energy consumption or failure to meet energy standards compared to what was predicted for the building's performance [5,9,13,14]. This gap relates to the difference between predicted or designed energy consumption and measured or actual performance [9]. Some discrepancy between prediction and measurement is due to numerical errors in simulation [13], inaccuracy of assumptions [15], inaccuracy of occupant behavior modeling [16] in the design stage, suboptimal usage of the building by occupants [14], and improperly working of equipment [17] in the operation stage or all of these reasons together. According to several studies, the observed energy consumption in buildings can be nearly 2.5 times higher than what was initially predicted for energy consumption [8,13]. The reduction of EPG is important as it facilitates improved energy management, cost savings, and environmental sustainability [18]. While it is inevitable to have a degree of disparity between predicted and measured energy consumption due to factors like design and operational uncertainties, as well as limitations in measurement systems, it is essential to reduce it by first quantifying its extent and exploring its underlying causes. Doing so enables more accurate forecasting, increases energy simulation reliability during the design stage, and enhances our understanding of energy usage in buildings [19]. Several recent studies have focused on one of the factors affecting the energy performance gap, as presented in section 2. Previous studies [20\u201331] predominantly focused on case studies in Cfa and Cfb climates (based on the Koppen climate classification [32]). However, our study differs as we investigate a residential building located in the Bsk climate (Mashhad, Iran). Previous research has explored various factors influencing EPG, but this study takes into account the impact of boiler efficiency, and lack of awareness of occupants. In this context, the influence of three factors, which include weather data, user behavior, and heating system efficiency, has been investigated simultaneously in order to reduce the energy performance gap. The primary aim of this paper is to comprehensively investigate the EPG between the design and operational stages with considering different aspects of the EPG occurring. To achieve this, a four-story residential apartment in a mixed dry climate located in Iran is selected as a case study. The study examines the EPG across both stages to provide practical recommendations for occupants and engineers to reduce the EPG at each stage. Studying EPG not only highlights the underperformance of the building during the operational stage but also discloses the disparity between the design assumptions and actual performance. This paper focuses on reducing EPG by enhancing the accuracy of simulations. The introduction in this paper follows by reviewing literature on causes and solutions for EPG, as well as the importance of accurate design stage simulations. The methodology section outlines the research approach with data collection, case studies, and heating gas simulation. Next is the results section, which presents evaluations of field research, analysis of five EPG types, and validation of simulation accuracy. The discussion section provides a thorough analysis and interpretation of the findings, while at the end, the conclusion summarizes the main points and suggests future research directions. 2 Literature review 2.1 Causes and solutions for EPG Energy Performance Gap (EPG) is influenced by various factors, which can be categorized into design and operation factors. Within the design stage, the causes can be further divided into three categories [14]. Firstly, inaccurate inputs and assumptions are utilized for building energy simulation [15]. Secondly, inaccuracies in climate data also impact the EPG [33]. Lastly, modeling occupant behavior can introduce inaccuracies to the model [34]. The causes of the operation stage can be classified into three different categories [14]. These include malfunctioning equipment [17], deficiencies in the execution of work [20,35], and suboptimal usage of the building by occupants [36]. Additionally, there are often hidden problems that are challenging to be detected [8]. For instance, design teams often face challenges in accurately predicting the future use of buildings, which can result in significant changes to operational requirements and conditions [13]. Tables 1 and 2 outline the causes and proposed solutions for reducing EPG at the design and operation stages, respectively. It is important to note that Hahn et al., [53] emphasized the significance of the interaction between building operators or facility managers and occupants in optimizing building operations to ensure occupant thermal comfort. This interaction holds greater importance compared to relying solely on data used for fault detection and monitoring the system status of key Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) components. Proper setup of HVAC systems during the operation stage can lead to a substantial reduction in building energy consumption, typically ranging from 20 % to 40 % [50]. Within the context of office buildings, Liang et al., [18] identified several factors contributing to the performance gap. These include occupants consuming more energy than anticipated, higher occupancy levels than initially projected, and malfunctions in energy-efficient technologies. Salehi et al., [21] investigated the energy performance of a university building situated in Canada. It was revealed that the actual energy performance of the building exceeded the predicted performance by approximately 60 %. The primary factor contributing to this performance gap was identified as differences in the operational processes compared to the model. Several operational issues arose from the presence of unexpected heat exchange and wastewater treatment facilities, which were unaccounted for in the modeled loads. Additionally, the actual usage of lighting and electrical loads significantly deviated from the predicted consumption. Another investigation by Burman et al., [55], focusing on a four-story academy in England encompassing both design and operational stages, concluded that the EPG can be reduced through the enhancement of simulation methods and feedback mechanisms between design and operation. These measures include the implementation of automatic controls and lighting management. Furthermore, increasing occupants' awareness emerges as a crucial solution for optimizing building usage. The EPG was recorded in social housing in Spain by Aranda et al., [57], who discovered that the gap was more pronounced in this housing sector. The distinct features of social housing, along with the varying consumption patterns of occupants, often characterized by a more economically vulnerable status, contribute to this divergence. It was observed that households in social housing typically reside in environments with temperatures below the average thermal comfort level. As a result, the actual energy consumption in these households was found to be 40 % lower than the simulated energy consumption. This outcome highlights the influence of occupants' economic status on energy consumption. Similarly, Van der Bent et al., [56] concluded that dwellings of Dutch used 30 % less actual heating energy compared to the design stage because occupants unable to heat the whole dwelling. In another study by Majcen et al., [59], the actual heating energy savings of 300,000 renovated dwellings in the Netherlands were examined. The results of their research showed considerable performance discrepancies in residences with insufficient insulation, local heating systems, and natural ventilation systems. Moreover, the study demonstrated that the simulation methods employed were disregarded accurate compared to actual consumption. Therefore, accurate design stage simulation is significant to reduce EPG. Table 3 shows the related research investigating the effect of EPG causes. Our aim is to investigate the below factors: \u2022 Technical issue (heat loss from construction junctions) \u2022 Technical issue (boiler efficiency) \u2022 Occupant behavior (setpoints, occupancy schedule, equipment and their schedule in each zone, domestic hot water, lighting) \u2022 Real EPW file 2.2 The design stage simulation Lifestyle and behavioral changes should be highlighted and considered in the design stage [60]. This includes considering factors such as occupancy schedules, lighting usage, and equipment utilization, which may vary based on occupants' habits [61]. During the design stage, building energy standards typically rely on fixed parameters as simulation assumptions for occupants' behavior [61]. Studies demonstrated energy consumption reductions of up to 23 % when these measures were implemented individually and a potential reduction of 41 % when implemented in combination [62]. In an effort to comprehend the Energy Performance Gap (EPG) and assess the impact of utilizing actual data instead of standards like ASHRAE [63] in simulation models, Cuerda et al., [24] conducted a simulation study using DesignBuilder® software. The simulation incorporated a questionnaire-based assessment of resident behavior, actual building information, and Spanish national regulations. The findings revealed that the energy consumption of the model simulated with standard data was four times less than the model simulated with actual data. The variables with the most significant influence on the disparity between using actual or standard data in simulation models were associated with user behavior during winter and summer, as well as summer weather data. Building energy codes commonly incorporate simulation-based compliance checking, where the proposed design is compared to a reference building using a simulation tool. However, these stringent standards often limit creativity in occupant-centric design, as they impose restrictions on exploring different building properties and HVAC configurations [64]. Standards and codes typically enforce specific occupancy models and assumptions, requiring consistency in usage scenarios and even providing recommended schedules for various parameters. Modeling by regulations and standards should be regarded as an initial step in the occupant-centric design process. This model should be followed by more flexible and exploratory design modeling to better accommodate the needs and preferences of occupants [61]. Technical issues represent another significant parameter that causes EPG. For instance, the efficiency of boilers, as stated in manufacturers\u2019 catalogs, is typically measured under laboratory and standard conditions. However, it is important to note that boiler units tend to lose their efficiency over time, especially after prolonged use [65]. The efficiency of a boiler as a heating system depends on several factors, including the quality of the fuel, boiler insulation, percentage loading of the boiler, regular cleaning of boilers, and inlet water pressure [66]. Additionally, losses in tanks and primary pipework, as well as the positioning of the wall-mounted gas-fired boiler (whether it is placed on a shaded wall or under direct sunlight), can further reduce the overall efficiency of the boiler [67]. Therefore, during the design stage, it is essential to consider that the actual efficiency of the mechanical equipment, after operation, will likely be lower than the value stated in the catalog due to these aforementioned factors. Irrespective of any inherent errors in simulation software, researchers propose a general solution to reduce EPG, which involves incorporating as much real data as possible. This includes accurate building characteristics, modeling of spaces and the surrounding environment, and consideration of external building conditions such as climate [68]. While the use of an on-site weather station can provide accurate data, it often requires substantial financial investment, including the purchase or rental of sensors, as well as data processing and validation. As an alternative, González et al., [69] utilized data from a third-party weather company for energy modeling in their case study, which proved to be a more accurate option compared to relying solely on weather stations located at airports or specific locations within a city. Therefore, building simulations should strive to incorporate locally customized climate data that precisely represents local conditions, considering the potential effects of climate change [14]. 3 Methodology In this research, the impact of technical issues, occupant behavior, and the EnergyPlus® Weather (EPW) file on reducing the Energy Performance Gap (EPG) associated with the design stage was investigated in a four-story residential building. As Fig. 1 illustrates, this study has five steps. Initially, the design data of case studies including building envelope, heating system details, and ASHRAE assumptions for the design stage were collected. The second step contains actual data collected from the field. In this step, a questionnaire was used to obtain the occupants' usage patterns and behavior, and the real heating system\u2019s efficiency. Also, indoor and outdoor temperatures and monthly gas bills from September 2022 to March 2023 were collected. The real EPW file and the operational heating consumption are the outcomes of this step. After that, in Step 3, the heating gas consumption in the design stage is predicted using the ASHRAE standard [63] and the design data from Step 1, the real EPW file, and the real heating system's efficiency from Step 2. In Step 4 a calibrated model is simulated for each case by using Step 2 data. Also, calibrated models with questionnaire data were validated using ASHRAE Guideline 14 [70]. Finally, the impact of the occupant behavior, the heating system's efficiency as a technical issue, and the EPW file on the EPG are obtained. 3.1 Case study The case study in this research consists of four residential units located within an apartment block building in Mashhad, Iran, as shown in Fig. 2 a. In these cases, gas is used for cooking and heating, while electricity is used for cooling. Fig. 2b presents a 3D model of the building created in DesignBuilder, and Fig. 2c displays the floor plans of each case study. According to ASHRAE [71] climate classification, Mashhad city is in the 4B category which indicates mixed dry weather. Table 4 shows building physics, occupants\u2019 data, and HVAC system information of the case study. Each floor has a wall-mounted heating system (its nominal capacity is 25.7 kW) inside. Heating systems in this study are almost identical, same model (M24FF) by the same manufacturer. This model has two converters and a fan for smoke and exhaust gas. These boilers were installed on all four floors at the same time. The boiler has two coils, one for domestic hot water and the other for the space heating system. In space heating, the water enters the boiler and after heating it is transferred to the radiators in each zone of the house through the pipes. In terms of domestic hot water, the water enters the boiler, and after heating it is transferred to the faucets. 3.2 Data collection The building envelope data and technical specifications of the building systems were obtained from the case study\u2019s design documents. To collect actual operational details, questionnaires were distributed and collected from the occupants. The questionnaire is provided in Appendix A. In addition, hourly indoor temperatures of the living room on each floor and outdoor weather data were measured using the Ambient Weather WS-2000 device. Gas consumption data were collected through metered energy. In this research, we intend to investigate the amount of heating gas gap. Since the gas meter in the case study is singular per residence, the gas bill includes gas usage for domestic hot water, cooking, and space heating purposes. In order to isolate the space heating gas consumption for our investigation, the average summer gas consumption was subtracted from the autumn bills (when the space heating system is on) for the studied period, based on the assumption that hot meals and beverages are consumed more in cold seasons. According to Fuentes et al., [72] and Gerin et al., [73], the amount of hot water used by occupants in the winter is almost 125 % higher than in the summer season. In addition, according to Tanaka et al., [74] the gas for cooking in the winter is almost 125 % higher than in the summer. Therefore, to estimate the heating gas consumption, 1.25 times the average summer gas consumption was deducted from the winter gas bills. In this way, a more accurate estimation of the gas used for heating in each case was obtained. The questionnaire was necessary to simulate heating consumption and assess occupants' awareness of their own behavior. Occupants may not be accurate regarding their energy behavior [75], therefore occupants' lack of awareness is a factor in operational stage\u2019s gap. It consisted of four parts: (a) Occupancy schedule, (b) Hours and months of HVAC system usage, (c) Hours of use for lighting facilities and power ratings of lamps, and (d) The timetable of cooking and usage of electrical equipment along with their power. Occupants were also asked questions about the heating setpoint. However, they did not provide accurate responses regarding the setpoint of their house, so in order to measure the setpoint on each floor, the Ambient Weather WS-2000 device was used, and the data was used to calculate the gap due to occupant behavior. Our approach involved using indoor temperature measurements to indirectly estimate the approximate heating setpoint for each floor. We utilized the actual temperature data from the indoor environment to infer this information. This indirect approach was chosen as it allowed us to gather valuable data leading to a more comprehensive and less intrusive data collection process. The outdoor weather data was used to generate an actual EPW file, while the indoor temperature measurements were employed to validate the simulation results and estimate the approximate heating setpoint for each floor. 3.3 Heating gas simulation To comprehensively investigate the Energy Performance Gap (EPG) concerning heating gas, a comparative analysis between the operational stage (bills), the as-designed stage (based on ASHRAE standards), and simulations based on questionnaire responses was conducted. The focused was on three significant causes of EPG and explored potential reduction strategies. The parameters examined were technical issues, occupant behavior, and the EPW file. Hourly weather data for the designated period were collected using the Ambient Weather WS-2000 device, and an EPW file was generated based on the recorded data. The heating setpoint was determined by monitoring indoor temperature. Occupant behavior, including occupancy schedules, was obtained through questionnaires. In Section 2.2, the importance of boiler efficiency as a technical issue affecting heating consumption is investigated. Therefore, the accurate efficiency of a gas-fired system is measured and the calculations are summarized in Section 4.2. For the design stage, three simulations were conducted: the first using ASHRAE assumptions with the Airport EPW file, the second using ASHRAE assumptions with the actual EPW file, and the last considering ASHRAE assumptions with the actual EPW file and a 56 % boiler efficiency (the two previous were with 89 % efficiency). Regarding the questionnaire, the simulation was with the assumptions collected from occupants with a 56 % boiler efficiency, which is consistent with the finding reported by other researchers [76]. Finally, the results of heating gas consumption were compared for the studied time period. 3.4 EnergyPlus weather (EPW) file To collect outdoor weather data at the site, the Ambient Weather WS-2000 device was implemented. This device has two instruments, for indoor and outdoor data collection. Fig. 3 a shows this device when it was installed on the roof to collect outdoor weather data, and Fig. 3b shows the indoor humidity and temperature collecting device. The following factors of outdoor weather are collected through this device: outdoor dry bulb (°F) with an accuracy of ± 2°F, dew point (°F), outdoor humidity with ± 5 % accuracy, barometric pressure (inHg) with an accuracy of 0.08 inHg, solar radiation (w/m2), wind direction with an accuracy of ± 10°, wind speed (mph) with an accuracy of ± 2.2 mph and hourly rain (in.) with an accuracy of ± 5 %. The remaining factors needed in EPW files which are mainly regional and do not vary much at short distances are extracted from the Mashhad Airport EPW, which is accessible freely from the Climate One Building website [77].The outdoor data are collected hourly from October 2022 to March 2023. The Ambient Weather WS-2000 device data was exported in CSV format. To create the EPW file, the Elements Software [78] convert CSV to EPW format. 4 Results and discussion In this research, the investigation of the Energy Performance Gap (EPG) involved comparing three energy consumption results: actual energy consumption, simulated energy consumption based on occupants' behavior, and simulated energy consumption based on the ASHRAE standard. The causes and solutions of EPG at both the design and operation stages were examined through a case study of four residential apartments. The effect of three significant causes of EPG was examined: occupant behavior, the EPW file, and technical issues. 4.1 Evaluation of field research The analysis of questionnaires collected from occupants of the four case studies revealed that approximately 75 % of them utilized the heating system from October to March and 25 % from October to April. Moreover, all occupants reported that the heating system is always turned on during cold days. This finding indicates that thermal comfort is the occupants' priority, not optimal energy consumption. Using questionnaires, it has been determined that occupants of the 4th floor reduce the radiator's setpoint from around 11 am to 2 pm in order to maintain thermal comfort. However, the occupants were unable to provide precise information about hourly boiler temperature adjustments, as they are influenced by outside temperature and behavioral factors. Analysis of the occupants' operation schedules based on the questionnaires revealed that in weekdays, 35 % of occupants spend 3 h, 14 % spend 13 h, and 21 % spend 9 h outside. Furthermore, 30 % of occupants typically spend most of their time at home. On weekends, 58 % of occupants spend 7 h, 21 % spend 3 h and 21 % spend 16 h outside. The occupants' operation schedules based on the questionnaires also indicate that the occupants' age and occupation have an impact on the pattern of operation schedules. Fig. 4 illustrates the gas utilities for each apartment unit over the past three years. The examination of gas consumption data from the bills indicates that the highest gas consumption in the investigated case studies occurred during the cold months, primarily due to the use of the heating system. Conversely, the lowest gas consumption was observed during the summer season, attributed to hot water and cooking. Specifically, the highest gas consumption was recorded in December and January. However, in order to investigate the heating energy performance gap, this study focused on the period from October 2022 to March 2023. This particular period was selected because it offered comprehensive and reliable data regarding occupant behavior and weather conditions (the EPW file). 4.2 The efficiency of gas-fired boiler The boiler efficiency is effective on the simulated energy consumption in the design stage and the resulting gap as mentioned in Section 2.2. Ibrahim and Al-Qassimi [79] provided the calculation formula for the boiler efficiency. To use this formula, some parameters should be measured to obtain loss fractions. The measured parameters and loss fractions are listed in Table 5 . Considering that the boilers used in the case study building have the same specifications, only the parameters of the fourth-floor boiler have been measured. The thermal efficiency can be calculated by subtracting the heat loss fractions from 100. So, the overall efficiency of the boiler is calculated to be 56 % instead of 89 %, which is mentioned in the manufacturer\u2019s catalog. (1) Gas - f i r e d b o i l e r e f f i c i e n c y = 100 - L 1 + L 2 + L 3 + L 4 + L 5 + L 6 = 56 % The observed 33 % reduction in boiler efficiency is indeed noteworthy and may raise questions about the potential root causes. To address this concern, we offer the following insights: 1. Operational Factors: The reduction in boiler efficiency may be attributed to various operational factors, such as suboptimal maintenance practices, incorrect fuel type or quality (gas BTU in winter during peak demand might not be the same as in summer), improper combustion settings, variations in load profiles during the study period, burner settings, control system calibration, or water treatment. Investigating the specific operational conditions during the measurement period is essential. We cannot measure the quality of the incoming gas and we can only measure the efficiency of the boiler. On the other hand, claiming gas BTU variation, need substantial support as it will have considerable legal and political consequences. 2. Manufacturers' Reported Efficiency: Manufacturers typically report boiler efficiencies under ideal or standardized conditions, which may not reflect real-world operating conditions. These standard conditions often assume optimal combustion, load, and other factors that can differ from actual usage. 3. Maintenance and Cleanliness: Boiler efficiency can degrade over time due to the accumulation of soot, scale, or other deposits. Differences in maintenance practices or cleanliness might contribute to the lower efficiency observed. 4. Boiler Sizing: The boiler's capacity might not align perfectly with the actual load requirements, leading to less efficient operation. 5. System Integration: The efficiency of the entire heating system, including distribution and control components, can affect the overall observed boiler efficiency 4.3 Heating gap The results of the questionnaire simulations provide insights into occupants' behavior and their level of knowledge regarding energy usage. Simulations based on ASHRAE assumptions [63] are considered representative of the design stage, while gas consumption for heating, as indicated in the bills, represents the operational stage. Fig. 5 illustrates each floor's heating gas consumption from October 2022 to March 2023, comparing data from bills, questionnaire simulations, and ASHRAE simulations. This allows for an investigation of the impact of selected causes of the Energy Performance Gap (EPG). In Mashhad, heating systems are typically on from October 2022 to March 2023. Therefore, this period is selected for investigating the heating performance gap in this study. For this investigation, four simulations were conducted. Firstly, the energy consumption in the design stage according to the ASHRAE standard is simulated with the Airport EPW file and the boiler efficiency which is mentioned in its manufacturer\u2019s catalog. The second simulation is the design stage which is affected by the actual boiler efficiency. The third simulation is the design stage simulation affected by the actual boiler efficiency and real EPW file. So far, the impacts of two factors on the design stage have been considered. Through the questionnaire, user behaviors that affect energy consumption such as occupancy schedule and indoor setpoints have been collected. Therefore, the fourth simulation is the questionnaire simulation with the actual boiler efficiency and the real EPW file. In this simulation, the impact of the third factor, occupant behavior, is considered. From Fig. 5, the difference between the first and second simulations shows the effect of the boiler efficiency on the EPG; which is referred to as the \u201cgap due to heating system efficiency\u201d. The difference between the second and third simulations shows the effect of the EPW file on the EPG; which is referred to as the \u201cgap due to the EPW file\u201d. The difference between occupants' behavior (fourth simulation) and the assumptions made by the standard (third simulation) shows the effect of occupant behavior on the EPG and is termed the \u201cgap due to occupant behavior\u201d. The \u201cdesign stage's gap\u201d represents the disparity between actual energy consumption (as indicated in the bills) and predicted energy usage during the design stage (first simulation). The \u201coperational stage's gap\u201d is related to bills and the fourth simulation, and encompasses other technical issues such as U-values and occupants' lack of awareness [75] regarding their behavior. The assumptions for energy modeling based on ASHRAE are the same for all case studies, and the second and third floors have the same physical characteristics and adiabaticity (ceiling, floor, western wall). So, as shown in Fig. 5, the energy consumption calculated for the models based on the ASHRAE standard is the same on these two floors. However, the energy consumption for the first floor, in which the western wall and roof are adiabatic (does not have an adiabatic floor), is more than the second and third floors. Finally, the energy consumption for the fourth floor, which has only an adiabatic floor been more than other case studies. In addition, the difference between case studies in terms of energy consumption obtained by bills and simulation with the questionnaires is related to the differences in occupants' behavior. Fig. 5 demonstrates that energy consumption exceeds the values considered by the simulations of the ASHRAE standard, indicating that the operational stage energy consumption is more than the design stage consumption. Gap due to occupant behavior shows the suboptimal occupant behavior and inefficient energy usage. In addition, the amount of gap due to occupant behavior on the third and fourth floors is less than the other two floors, exhibiting better energy efficiency on the third and fourth floors. This highlights the significant impact of occupant behavior on energy consumption and the EPG in both the design and operation stages. The fixed occupancy schedule prescribed by standards in the design stage led to differences in energy consumption between the design and the operational stages. These schedules should be adjusted to reflect societal conditions, such as quarantine measures resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as cultural aspects, to ensure that the results of the design stage align better with the operational stage. It should be noted that changes in occupants' operational schedules will also affect data related to lighting and equipment usage in the building. Additionally, occupants' comfort temperatures during the operational stage often differ from the temperatures considered in the standard simulations in the design stage. By relying on fixed assumptions regarding occupants' behavior in simulations, different behavior patterns are overlooked, leading to the occurrence of EPG during the design stage. In this study, the cooling and heating setpoints according to the ASHRAE standard for residential buildings are 23.8 °C and 21.1 °C, respectively [63]. However, the questionnaire and indoor temperature measurements showed that the setpoints are different based on the occupants\u2019 preferences. This highlights the importance of recognizing behavioral differences among residents. Table 6 lists the numerical data of the investigated performance gaps; in other words, it presents the numerical results of Fig. 5. Table 6 reveals that the third floor exhibits the lowest gap during the design stage, while the first floor has the largest gap. As mentioned in the literature review, accurate design stage simulation is significant for reducing EPG, due to designers and engineers have the most influence on reducing EPG in the design stage than in the operational stage. This study examined the effect of three significant factors on the design stage gap, and Table 7 identifies the impact of each factor on the design stage gap. From Table 7, the first floor has the most operational stage gap and gap due to occupant behavior, which means occupants are less cognizant of using energy and therefore consume more energy than they think. Therefore, the influence of occupants on the EPG is greater compared to other factors on the first and second floors, which can be numerically recognized in Table 7. Conversely, on the third and fourth floors, where occupants demonstrate conscious behavior and possess knowledge of energy usage according to Table 6, the effect of wall-mounted gas-fired boiler efficiency surpasses other factors as shown in Table 7. Furthermore, Table 7 shows that the real EPW file has an impact of over 2 % in the investigated cases, underscoring the need to consider this factor in design stage simulations. Respectively, correct boiler efficiency, accounting for different occupant behaviors, and employing the accurate EPW file have the greatest influence on reducing the design stage gap. As listed in Table 7, the accuracy of the EPW file can influence the gap in the design stage. The weather file used in the design stage simulation was based on data from Mashhad airport station between 2007 and 2021. Given the issue of climate change since 2021 and the fact that the station is located approximately 20 km away from the studied building, as shown in Fig. 2, the weather file information deviates from reality, resulting in the design stage gap. In addition to the distance, there are other factors that affect the difference between the data of the airport station and the building station. For instance, the vegetation cover around the airport station was more than the building site, as shown in Fig. 2. In addition, the terrain around the building was mountain-type, while around the airport station was plain. Also, the height above sea level at the building site was 1128 m, and at the airport station was 990 m. Therefore, collecting regional weather data to obtain accurate EPW files can help eliminate the effect of this factor on EPG. Another factor that can contribute to the gap at the design stage is the mismatch between the power and efficiency of heating system components, including the wall-mounted gas-fired boiler, and the specifications provided in manufacturer\u2019s catalogs. The catalog specifications for materials and equipment are typically obtained under specific conditions. It is advisable to gather detailed specifications for building physics and equipment efficiency at the construction site to utilize in simulations. The boiler can also impact EPG during operational stage. Equipment deterioration and lack of regular maintenance result in increased energy consumption during operational stage. To investigate another factor influencing the EPG, thermal imaging of the building envelope was conducted. Fig. 6 depicts thermal images revealing leakage through the mortar between construction junctions. The use of insulation in external walls, the involvement of experienced personnel, and collaboration among all project stakeholders improve construction quality, subsequently reducing the EPG during the operational stage. 4.4 Validating the accuracy of simulations To validate the accuracy of the model's energy results, ASHRAE Guideline 14 [70] recommends using the coefficient of variation (CV) of the root-mean-square error (RMSE) and the Normalized Mean Bias Error (NMBE). Additionally, the model's predictions for indoor temperatures are cross-validated against monitored data. The calibrated model should exhibit a CV(RMSE) of less than 15 % [70], NMBE of 5 % [70], mean absolute error (MAE) of less than 1 °C, and RMSE of less than 1.5 °C [20]. These can be computed as follows: (2) C V RMSE = Σ i ̇ = 1 n M i - S i 2 n M ¯ (3) N M B E = Σ I ̇ = 1 n M i - S i n × M ¯ (4) RMSE = Σ i ̇ = 1 n M i - S i 2 n (5) M A E = 1 n Σ i = 1 n | M i - S i | where n is the number of samples of the test set, Mi refers to the real value of i-th sample, Si refers to the predictive value of ith sample. Table 8 presents the validation results, based on the indoor temperature and heating gas consumption, for all simulations conducted based on the questionnaire. The first and second floor simulations have CV(RMSE) and NMBE values exceeding 15 % and 5 %, respectively. This can be attributed to the occupants' lack of knowledge about their own behavior, as discussed in Sections 3.2 and 4.3, and also to the fluctuations of gas quality in winter, when the pipeline network is heavily tasked [80]. The CV(RMSE) and NMBE for the third floor are less than 15 % and 5 %, and CV(RMSE) for fourth floor is less than 15 % which validates the accuracy of the simulations. In addition, as mentioned in Table 8, MAE and RMSE results are less than 1 °C and 1.5 °C. Consequently, it can be concluded that the simulations are partially validated. Fig. 7 illustrates the simulated and measured temperatures which verify the accuracy of the model. Time periods for each floor in Fig. 7 were selected through the occupants\u2019 convenience, based on the time when occupants were at home and allowed to place measuring instruments. 5 Conclusions This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the Energy Performance Gap (EPG) across four residential units in the same block to provide valuable insights into performance issues during the design stage. The EPG relates to the difference between designed and actual energy consumption, and reducing EPG enables better energy management, cost savings, and environmental sustainability. In this study, the EPG examined by comparing standard model, questionnaire model, and billing records for heating gas consumption. The validation of the questionnaire model, for energy use by CV(RMSE) and NMBE and for space temperatures by MAE and RMSE, confirms its suitability for modeling occupant behavior. This simulation-based approach allows for the investigation of parameters that impact the design stage. Based on the literature review, three factors were identified as influencing the EPG in the design stage: occupant behavior, the EPW file, and the boiler efficiency as a technical issue of the heating system. The impact of the first factor can be reduced by incorporating at least three occupant behavior types (occupants with high, moderate, and low consumption) into the standard assumptions. The second factor requires accurate EPW files, which may necessitate specialized equipment. The third factor requires attention and correction from manufacturers to ensure optimal system functioning. In addition, this factor requires measuring boiler efficiency, as our study shows the efficiency of the boiler was 56 %, whereas the manufacturer\u2019s catalog shows it as 89 %. Furthermore, improving occupants' knowledge about their behavior and implementing regular equipment maintenance during the operational stage can reduce the effects of the first and third factors. Overall, the average impact on reducing the design stage gap for correct boiler efficiency, consideration of different occupant behaviors, and use of accurate EPW files was about 43.9 %, 26 %, and 6.6 %, respectively. According to the results, the third floor showed the lowest energy performance gap because of accurate occupancy behavior report and on the other hand, the first-floor significant gap is mainly because of the inability of its' occupants in reporting their real energy behavior. While our research has made significant strides in quantifying the impact of heating system efficiency, weather data accuracy, and occupant behavior on bridging the Energy Performance Gap (EPG), it is important to acknowledge that this study focuses on a specific case study in Iran, which may not capture the full spectrum of factors influencing EPG in diverse geographical and building contexts. In this study, the measured boiler efficiency is not seasonal average efficiency and it is only measured one time by an expert. It is worth noting that this study is performed during one cold season (6 months), hence the dataset is limited. Studies such as the research by Hansen et al., [81] demonstrated that increasing the sample size can reduce statistical error e.g. RMSE. Conducting research for multiple cold seasons might increase validation accuracy. These limitations suggest several promising avenues for future research: \u2022 Future studies could expand their scope to include a broader range of geographical locations and climate zones to assess how regional variations in weather patterns and building designs contribute to EPG. \u2022 Investigating EPG in different types of buildings (e.g., commercial, industrial) can provide insights into how the phenomenon varies across various sectors of the construction industry. \u2022 As new technologies and building materials continue to emerge, research can explore how these innovations impact EPG and energy efficiency. \u2022 Assessing the effectiveness of energy efficiency policies and incentives on reducing EPG can provide valuable insights into the role of government initiatives in mitigating this gap. \u2022 Conducting long-term studies that track building performance over several years can shed light on how EPG evolves and fluctuates over time, accounting for changes in technology, occupant behavior, and building maintenance. \u2022 Increasing the sample size and investigating heating gas consumption for multiple cases. The results yielded that it is crucial to consider including the number of electrical appliances, boiler efficiency, and occupancy schedules to enhance the reliability of simulation results. In addition, using smart technologies such as building automation, control systems, and smart meters, as noted by Li et al., [39], can improve energy efficiency and enhance occupant comfort by employing self-regulation devices to optimize indoor climate control. These findings align with similar studies [21,39,51], suggesting that the identified issues are likely applicable to the design stage and standards. For future research, it is recommended to develop a framework that investigates other factors influencing the reduction of the gap by eliminating the effect of occupant behavior on energy consumption. Furthermore, addressing uncertainties related to the building performance gap can help stakeholders identify the most influential parameters in reducing the EPG during the design, construction, and operation stages. Adopting a smart city perspective and exploring the impact of Internet of Things (IoT) technology and smart homes on the EPG can also be an effective avenue for investigation.

        "dc:description": "The Energy Performance Gap (EPG) in buildings is a recognized phenomenon. However, its definition and underlying factors are extensive, necessitating a thorough investigation of the quantitative impact of each factor contributing to the EPG. In this research, a calibration-based approach is employed to identify and measure the contribution of these factors. Questionnaires, measurements, analyses, and calibrations are conducted on the energy performance of four residential units of an apartment block building in Iran as a case study. Subsequently, the impact rates of three key causes of the EPG, namely heating system efficiency, weather data in an EnergyPlus Weather (EPW) format file, and occupant behavior, are determined. By incorporating these causes into the model calibration process, the disparities between the design and operation stages are decreased. The study highlights the significance and quantifiable effects of accurate and measured boiler efficiency, utilizing a genuine EPW file rather than a convenient EPW file e.g., airport stations, and adopting precise and adaptable assumptions for occupant behavior modeling in bridging the EPG between the design and operation stages. There are a number of factors that impact the design stage gap, including boiler efficiency, occupant behavior, and a corrected EPW file, which contribute 43.9%, 26%, and 6.6%, respectively.",
