The absorber is a thermal machine that exploits waste heat provided by external systems, such as boilers or heat generators, to refrigerate water; for this reason it is used whenever possible to increase the efficiency of the overall cooling station. It is also equipped with an evaporative tower and it is used in parallel configuration with the chillers. Inside the absorber, complex reactions take place, see Ref. [25], its physical modelling is highly complex, and infeasible in our case due to the lack of information about its parameters, and its on/off status during the considered time period. The absorber represents the main unknown disturbance of the overall system, since, when turned on, the pumps circulate a nominal cooled flowrate w a b s , of the same order of magnitude as w c h . As for the cooled outlet temperature T r a b s ( t ) , it often does not settle to any setpoint, and varies depending on the thermal power provided to the absorber. \u2022 Users. The users comprise offices, commercial spaces, meeting rooms etc., distributed over the five buildings and the fifteen floors. They receive water from the three collectors after the pumping unit. The water returns at a higher temperature, which depends on the users' thermal load. In total the users are divided into eight groups (\u201cend-users\u201d in Fig. 2), with inlet and outlet temperature measures, denoted T i n j ( t ) and T o u t j ( t ) , j = 1 , \u2026 , 8 , respectively.

The optimal cooling operation of a large business center, with five buildings totalling about 70,000\u202fm2 of interiors, is considered. This problem is relevant due to the high operational costs and energy demand of the cooling system. The latter features four chillers currently managed with heuristic rules. The aim of this study is to redesign the control system to minimize the energy consumption while still meeting the cooling demand. The main challenges are the impossibility to derive a model of the system based on physics, due to its high complexity and lack of information on each subsystem, and the on-off behavior and hysteretic operational constraints of the chillers. To solve this problem, a structured black-box dynamical model of the system is derived using machine learning techniques, exploiting a dataset of more than 500 days of operation. The employed quantities are easily measurable and include the flow rate and temperature of the cooling water, electric power consumption, and external temperature and humidity. Then, the derived model has been used to optimally tune the feedback control strategy via nonlinear programming, by minimizing the predicted energy consumption while satisfying the cooling demand. Simulation results with a validation dataset indicate that the proposed approach achieves an energy saving of 30% with respect to the controller currently adopted, while keeping the temperature in the desired range. The proposed modelling approach, based on data, results in a high applicability to plants with different layouts and components, whenever measurements of the relevant quantities are available. Keywords Cooling station Control for energy saving Identification Modelling Optimization HVAC systems 1 Introduction The topic of energy saving in buildings by optimization of their cooling plants is receiving a growing interest, see for example [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]. This trend is motivated by the large share, over 38% according to Ref. [8], of the overall energy consumption attributable to buildings; within that, about 50% pertains to Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems, see Ref. [9]. Notably, this percentage grows up to 76% in European countries, see Ref. [10], making this issue of pivotal importance. In this kind of plants, it is typical to use simple rule-based logics [11] that allow to run the system in a satisfactory but non efficient way, so that there is room for the development of smarter solutions. The attention to this topic also results in private and public incentives to enhance energy-efficient solutions, for both environment preservation and economic convenience. From public institutions, many certificates for sustainability of buildings have been devised, such as the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) given by the U.S. Green Building Council, see Ref. [12], together with guidelines to assess energy performances of buildings, see Ref. [13]. In the literature, modelling and control of HVAC systems have been discussed by several authors. Among the several contributions related to the modelling approaches, [2] relies on physical equations, intrinsically needing a lot of prior information, and takes advantage of the possibility of performing experimental tests on the plant, while [3] develops a predictive control strategy based on an electric equivalent of the network, whose layout is fully known. In Ref. [6] the model of the system is developed only for the cooling station, without including the users; indeed, the modular approach proposed therein is based on nonlinear physical equations of each component, similarly to Ref. [14]. A completely different approach is proposed in Ref. [7], where the whole plant is described by means of a comprehensive neural network, that turns out to be effective, but does not allow to have physical insights of the phenomena, and makes it difficult to exploit the, possibly little, prior information available. Neural models trained from data are also exploited in Ref. [15], where the focus is on the cooling load prediction, without comprising the whole cooling station. Also, a collection and comparison of different black-box modelling approaches for HVAC systems is reported in Ref. [16], where a relatively small residential system is considered. Regarding the control strategy, many authors propose the adoption of advanced control techniques, see for example [17,18,19], though these schemes often entail several issues for their practical implementation [20]. A number of approaches has been proposed to simplify their design and deployment, among these it is possible to recall the recent contributions [21,22] relying on machine learning tools. However, the deployment and installation of a novel controller still remains a crucial issue, even more when it needs measurements from several devices placed over the typically large and distributed HVAC station. In this article we first derive a complete dynamic model of the cooling station of a large commercial site located in Milan, northern Italy, then we use this model for control design, ending with a ready-to-use solution. Preliminary results on the identification stage are reported in Ref. [23], and here they are extended and completed with the control optimization. The commercial center is composed of five buildings with fifteen floors each, see Fig. 1 for an aerial view of the site. The buildings are almost totally devoted to offices and commercial spaces, but there are also two server rooms, a canteen, an auditorium and other facilities. In working days (Monday-Friday), it is estimated that about 7000 people occupy this center, about 2000 people are present on Saturdays, while on Sunday the main thermal load is due to the servers, except for extra events, such as conferences and meetings. A unique cooling station is in charge of providing cold water for air-conditioning in spring and summer to the offices, and to disperse the heat produced by the servers and data centers over the whole year, that indeed constitute a non-negligible permanent load. Due to the complexity of the problem, to the lack of fundamental information on the size and behavior of many devices, and to the uncertain knowledge of the users' demand and operating conditions, a purely physical modelling approach would be hardly feasible. On the other hand, with a totally black-box approach, the fundamental a-priori information on the plant layout would be lost and the achieved results could not be given the physical insight required to interpret and rely on the identified models. These reasons have suggested to adopt a structured black-box approach, based on the decomposition of the large-scale plant into smaller subsystems, connected through known quantities. In the modelling of the subsystems, all the available physical information has been used to select the structure of the linear and nonlinear dynamic models, which have been identified starting from the very large set of data available, related to more than 500 days of operation, with more than 400 recorded variables. The obtained models of the subsystems have been tested singularly and then linked together. The overall model of the plant so obtained has proven to capture the main system's dynamics without being too complex, and for this reason it has been used in the control design phase. The commercial center is already controlled with a relay-based logic acting on the switch on/off of the chillers. In order to obtain immediately applicable results, not requiring any structural change of the control system, it has been decided to optimize the parameters of the existing logic, i.e. the thresholds on the temperatures governing the switch on/off of the chillers and the idle time between successive switches, with the main goal to minimize the energy consumption. Considering a period of one week, an optimization problem has been formulated by minimizing a cost function penalizing the energy consumption and the users\u2019 discomfort, and by including physical constraints on the plant variables. By relying on the identified model, the optimal solution has been computed in terms of thresholds and idle time variations with respect to the nominal (currently applied) values. The results achieved, tested in simulation with the model over one week-long period, show that roughly 30% of energy savings can be obtained with respect to the existing solution, thanks to control optimization. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 the overall cooling station is presented. In Section 3 the model identification approach and the adopted criteria for model structure selection are described. Section 4 concerns the problems and the results achieved in the identification of the main subsystems, namely the chillers, the pipes and the users. In Section 5 the overall model, composed of the previously identified subsystems, is built and its performance is compared with the measured data in closed-loop validation. Lastly, Section 6 describes the current control logic, the design of the optimized one and compares their performance in the simulated environment. Conclusions and directions for future work are discussed in Section 7.

The main components are: \u2022 Primary and secondary loops. In the system, two loops can be distinguished. The primary loop comprises the delivery manifold, the by-pass valve, and the return manifold. The loop is closed across the chillers and the absorber, and two measures of the water temperature are available: T i ( t ) on the delivery manifold and T o ( t ) on the return manifold (see Fig. 3). The bypass valve directly links the delivery and return manifolds, it is usually 100 % open and it is needed to balance the flowrates of the loops, in order to avoid overpressure and possible damage to the pumps. Its pressure drop, its flowrate w b p ( t ) , and its characteristic curve were not available for our study. Based on the experience of plant operators, a rough estimate of the total flowrate w t ( t ) circulating in the primary loop is 900\u202fm3/h during summer days. The secondary loop directs water from the primary loop to the users and drives it back after use. No parameters regarding length, sections, materials, geometry, deployment, and piping network configuration were available. The water splits in three collectors, feeding different groups of end-users, both on the forward line and on the return line, and the water temperature is measured on each of the six collectors. Four modulating pumps move water from the primary loop, they are controlled to maintain a delivery pressure; no measures are available. The pipes of the secondary-loop, from the cooling station to the end-users, can be tens of meters long, so that the physical transport delays are not negligible. In addition, the effects of solar radiation and thermal exchange with the environment cannot be neglected. \u2022 Four chiller units (in Fig. 2 only two are shown for clarity and space limitations). The chillers are thermal machines that cool water from the return manifold and send it to the delivery manifold; the subtracted heat is dispersed in the external environment by means of an evaporative tower. The chillers are connected in parallel and are activated by the control logic, being the only controllable components of the whole plant. They are linked to two circuits: the condenser, or auxiliary circuit (in green in Fig. 2) that circulates water to the evaporative towers, and the cooling circuit (in blue in the figure). In the cooling circuit, each chiller is fed by pumps drawing hot water from the users through a return manifold. These pumps operate only in discrete on/off states; when switched on, they provide a water flowrate that is not measured, so we assumed it constant and equal to its nominal value w c h for each chiller. This on/off behavior represents a bottleneck for an efficient operation, since the efficiency of the HVAC systems critically depends on their load, see Ref. [24], which should be varied in order to optimize their power consumption. A scheme of the chiller/tower group is shown in Fig. 4, where in dashed red we mark the pipes with higher water temperature, and in solid blue the ones with lower temperature. The evaporative tower disperses heat by means of controlled modulating fans. No details are available about the pumping units, the pipe lengths, the controller of the fans, and the adopted setpoint. Each chiller embeds a compressor, absorbing energy, that stabilizes the outlet temperature T r i ( t ) to the required set-point T r s p when a feasible load is demanded. Based on the available dataset, this condition is always satisfied, and we assume it will hold from now on. 3 Preliminary data analysis for model identification As a first step, outliers and infeasible records have been removed from the available data set. Then, average values have been computed when multiple sensors measure the same physical quantity, to this regard note that no prior information is available on the characteristics of the sensors. By inspection of the dataset, the (unknown) set-point T r s p used for control of the water temperature in the delivery manifold has been estimated equal to 8 o C. A non marginal water flowrate, w o f f ( t ) , passes through the chillers also in off conditions, but no measures are available. A coarse estimate, based on some spot measurements, is 30 % of w c h per chiller. Note that, since the water flowrate through the overall closed-loop circuit is related, through an unknown relation, to the loads and to the request by the users, w o f f is fundamental to guarantee the proper mass balance along the circuit. Also the state of the chillers is unknown, so that we reconstructed it a-posteriori by checking their power consumption P c h i ( t ) , i = 1,2,3,4 . More precisely, we defined a binary variable s i ( t ) indicating the state of the chiller, such that: (1) s i ( t ) = { 1 P c h i ( t ) > 0 0 P c h i ( t ) = 0 i = 1,2,3,4 Contrarily to the chillers, the absorber on/off status can not be estimated from power consumption, since the machine is not connected to any electrical power source, nor it is recorded. For this reason, we estimated it based on the inlet-outlet temperature difference in the cooling circuit, and with a threshold T t a b s to account for measurement noise and avoid high frequency (fictitious) switching. More precisely, we defined a binary variable s a b s ( t ) such that: (2) s a b s ( t ) = { 1 T r a b s ( t ) − T i n a b s ( t ) < T t a b s 0 o t h e r w i s e The water flowrate w u j ( t ) , j = 1 , \u2026 , 8 , in each of the eight pipes to the end-users is measured, so that the total water flowrate circulating in the secondary loop can be computed as: (3) w h o t ( t ) = ∑ j = 1 8 w u j ( t ) The variable w h o t ( t ) , along a week, is reported in Fig. 5 , its variations are in the range 700 − 850 m3/h save for significant drops, occurring typically at night. Three sets of temperature measurements are available concerning the users: 1. T i ( t ) and T o ( t ) , i.e. the delivery and return manifold water temperatures. 2. Temperature measures along the three collectors to/from the users (see Fig. 2). We computed their average on the return collectors, weighted by their flowrates, and named it T h o t ( t ) . 3. Temperature measures across the eight end-users, both on the inlet and outlet sides, named T i n j ( t ) and T o u t j ( t ) respectively, j = 1 , \u2026 , 8 . We indicate their weighted average values with T \u203e i n ( t ) and T \u203e o u t ( t ) , more precisely: (4) T \u203e i n ( t ) = ∑ j = 1 8 T i n j ( t ) w u j ( t ) w h o t ( t ) , T \u203e o u t ( t ) = ∑ j = 1 8 T o u t j ( t ) w u j ( t ) w h o t ( t ) At first we checked consistency of the available data, so we compared T o ( t ) with T h o t ( t ) and T \u203e o u t ( t ) . The comparison is shown in Fig. 6 . First we can notice that T \u203e o u t ( t ) is significantly biased, secondly in some periods also T h o t ( t ) is higher than T o ( t ) . These discrepancies can not be due to the effects of the solar radiation along the pipes, or to the thermal exchange with the environment, since these phenomena would produce the opposite effect. Therefore, the most likely reason is the bypass valve, that directly circulates cold water from the delivery manifold to the return manifold, thus decreasing the temperature in the latter. This is confirmed by the fact that this bias occurs only when many machines are active, as visible again in Fig. 6 where the number of active machines n o n ( t ) = ∑ i = 1 4 s i ( t ) + s a b s ( t ) is represented in dashed line. Unfortunately no measure of the by-pass flowrate w b p ( t ) is available; this additional information is fundamental to define the overall model of the system, so we had to estimate it as described in Section 4.2.4. On the delivery side, we first compared T i ( t ) with the three temperature measures on the delivery collectors, that exhibit the same pattern, see Fig. 7 , though a small bias (0.3\u202f°C) is sometimes present in one of the collectors, possibly due to the drift of one sensor. Indeed, by comparing T i ( t ) with the inlet measures on the end-users T i n j ( t ) , a significant difference appears again, as well as on the return side, as reported for completeness in Fig. 8 . 4 Model identification 4.1 Adopted modelling approach The model for the overall system has been obtained by connecting the models of the following subsystems: the chillers with their evaporative towers, the absorber, the end-users, and the piping system. These models are either static or dynamic, and have been estimated from data according to the following procedure, unless they directly follow from physical relations: \u2022 In the identification phase, linear model structures, including AutoRegressive-Exogenous (ARX), AutoRegressive-Moving-Average Exogenous (ARMAX), Output-Error (OE), see Ref. [26], have been first considered. More complex models, e.g. polynomial models and Neural Networks (NN), have been employed only when the first proved to be inadequate. \u2022 According to a well-established procedure, see Ref. [26], the identification phase has been performed on a subset of the data (identification set), while the model performances have been cross-validated on another subset (validation set). \u2022 The regressors to be included in the models have been chosen based on two principles: first we have chosen the variables that are known to mostly influence the output from physical considerations, then we have selected the most influencing regressors with a feature selection technique based on the LASSO algorithm [27]. In this approach, it is assumed that the output of the model y depends linearly on the vector of parameters θ to be estimated, through the relation y ( t ) = θ T ϕ ( t ) , where t is the discrete time variable, ϕ is the vector of regressors and T is the vector transpose operation. Note that ϕ ( t ) can be a nonlinear function of measured quantities. First, a Least Square problem including a large number of candidate regressors is solved, and its mean prediction squared error ε 2 is computed. Then, a first estimate of θ is obtained by solving the modified least squares problem (5) min θ | | θ | | 1 s . t . 1 N ∑ i = 1 N ( y ( t ) − θ T ϕ ( t ) ) 2 < γ ε 2 where N is the total number of available observations and γ > 1 is a conservative factor. Finally, the elements of the estimated vector θ with smaller absolute value (e.g. those below 1 100 of the maximum), which contribute less to compute the output, are removed from the model together with the corresponding regressors. The last step of the algorithm consists in retraining the model with the regressors selected in the first phase. 4.2 Model identification results The models of the different subsystems are described next. 4.2.1 Chillers and evaporative towers 4.2.1.1 Chiller cooled water temperature The temperature of the cooled water T r i ( t ) , see Fig. 4, is one of the most meaningful variables of the chiller. As anticipated, each time the chiller is activated, it settles to the desired setpoint T r s p = 8 o C. Typical transients are reported in Fig. 9 , which shows that AutoRegressive models (AR) are suitable to describe this dynamics. More specifically, the error variable is defined as (6) e ( t ) = T r s p − T r i ( t ) , i = 1,2,3,4 and estimated the parameters of the second-order AR model (7) e ( t ) = a 1 e ( t − 1 ) + a 2 e ( t − 2 ) The choice of a second-order model is motivated by the two physical phenomena of the system: the cooling of the heat exchanger inside the chiller, with a faster time constant, and the thermal exchange with the cooled water, with a slower time constant. The model has been identified with the data collected on chiller 4 and validated against other chillers, always leading to satisfactory results, see again Fig. 9. In chiller off conditions, T r i ( t ) is meaningless for the thermal balance, moreover its measurements are affected by drifts, possibly due to the external temperature and the solar radiation warming. 4.2.1.2 Chiller condenser output temperature The condenser output temperature T c i ( t ) , i = 1 , \u2026 , 4 has a significant influence upon the chiller's efficiency, see Refs. [28,7]. As shown in Fig. 4, T c i ( t ) depends on the water temperature from the return manifold T i n i ( t ) , on the environmental conditions expressed by the ambient temperature and humidity, T e x t ( t ) and H e x t ( t ) , respectively, on the chiller cooled water temperature T r i ( t ) (the output of the model previously described), and on the command v i ( t ) to the tower fans. These variables have been considered as inputs of a second order Output Error (OE) model, which represents a satisfactory compromise between accuracy and simplicity. The delays between inputs and output have been selected to be zero for all the inputs, save for the one related to v i ( t ) , which has been set equal to one, since this signal acts on the tower and is physically detached from the chiller. Fig. 10 shows the comparison between real data and model responses for T c i ( t ) , the latter identified on Chiller 4. The performance is satisfactory despite the many uncertainties, for instance the fact that the relative humidity measure is corrupted by a non negligible measurement noise. Again, the model is valid for the on condition of the chillers, while there is no utility in modelling T c i ( t ) during the off phases. 4.2.1.3 Chiller regulator identification The identification of the regulator computing the command to the fans v i ( t ) is required to simulate the model of T c i ( t ) . The following assumptions, to be validated a-posteriori, have been made: (i) the controller is a Proportional-Integral (PI) one, (ii) the controlled variable is T c i ( t ) , as confirmed by the plant operators, (iii) the setpoint is 24\u202f°C, as often specified in the guidelines of chiller manufacturers. The identification has been performed according to a direct approach, i.e. with the input-output data of the controller, neglecting the feedback effect, see Ref. [29]. The proportional and integral gains K p = − 25 and K i = − 1.5 × 10 − 5 have been obtained. In addition, it has been verified that the PI has been implemented without an anti wind-up scheme, that would be recommendable since the control input is often saturated, and without the reset of the initial condition at every switch of the chiller. The performances provided by the identified controller confirm the previous assumptions and can be considered satisfactory, as shown in Fig. 11 . 4.2.1.4 Chiller power consumption A detailed model of the chillers power consumption P c h i t , i = 1 , \u2026 , 4 is needed to properly state a control problem aimed at optimizing the managing costs. Starting from physical considerations, we first selected the following variables, assumed to be the most influencing ones: T i n i ( t ) , T r i ( t ) (obtained with the identified model specified in Section 4.2.1), the external conditions T e x t ( t ) and H e x t ( t ) , the control variable v i ( t ) , and T c i ( t ) , that is known from literature to influence the absorbed power. We a-priori considered as regressors all polynomials of first and second order, including cross-products of the selected variables. This choice is motivated by the physical insight that power is proportional to the square of some of the involved variables, in particular temperatures. Static models have been estimated, since from the physics it is reasonable to assume that possible delays between the model inputs and the power itself are negligible with respect to the adopted sampling time T s = 60 s. The identification procedure led to a model that is able to properly describe the power consumption (see Fig. 12 ), although sometimes less performing when applied to the data of chiller 1. This could be due to the different wear of the chiller and/or to the measurement noise related to the temperatures sensors. 4.2.2 Users As anticipated, the users are distributed over the five buildings, and very little information is available on their dynamical behavior. A modelling approach based on physical equations would be infeasible in this case, given the complexity of the process, the lack of information, and the sparse layout of the end-users. The main quantity to be described, in order to properly simulate the system and to reproduce the water heating dynamics, is the thermal power Q u ( t ) requested by all the users. With reference to the j-th end-user, the thermal power Q u j ( t ) can be computed as (8) Q u j ( t ) = ρ w c w w u j ( t ) ( T o u t j ( t ) − T i n j ( t ) ) where c w is the specific heat of the water and w u j ( t ) is the water flowing through the user's cooling circuit. This computation has been made with the flowrate measurements associated with the end-users, and not with the ones related to the delivery and return collectors, to mitigate as much as possible the effect of transport delays. Eventually the total thermal power is computed by summing all the end-users contributions: (9) Q u ( t ) = ∑ j = 1 8 Q u j ( t ) In principle, the required thermal power depends on the environmental conditions (represented by H e x t ( t ) and T e x t ( t ) ), on the day of the week, and on the hour of the day. For this reason, we have estimated two different models: one for the working days (Monday-Friday), and one for the weekends (Saturday and Sunday). As additional inputs, besides H e x t ( t ) and T e x t ( t ) , the minute of the day has been considered. In the working days this input goes from 1 (midnight) to 1440 (23:59), while for the weekends it goes from 1 to 2880, so as to distinguish between Saturdays and Sundays. The adopted model structure is a static neural network with one hidden layer and twenty neurons. The model outputs are compared to the real data in Fig. 13 (for weekdays), and 14 (for weekends). It is apparent that the network is capable to reproduce well the computed quantity Q u ( t ) , and especially the low-frequency components of the signal. The higher frequencies are due to switching and short-term regulations of the cooling machines at the users\u2019 side, that are totally unknown and unpredictable, and have to be accounted for as a disturbance against which the cooling station has to react. Note that in Fig. 14 the samples corresponding to different weekends are merged, so that the timescale is not continuous. 4.2.3 Pipes The pipes are among the most uncertain parts of the system, since no parameters are available on their length and section, and they can not be neglected both in terms of heat exchanged with the environment and of transport delay. Given the lack of information, and based on very rough estimates, the following simplifying assumptions have been introduced: (i) the five tubes out of the chillers and the absorber have radius R = 0.1 m and converge to the delivery manifold, whose cross-section is equal to the sum of sections of the inlet pipes, (ii) the average length from the cooling station to the end-users is L = 80 m. Considering an average value for w t ( t ) equal to w ˜ t = 750 m 3 / h (see Fig. 5), the average speed v ˜ is computed as: (10) v ˜ = ( w ˜ t 3600 ) / ( 5 π R 2 ) and the transport delay is estimated as: (11) Δ t d = L v ˜ ~ 60.31 s which is close to the adopted sampling time T s = 1 min. Thus, the unitary delay is added both on the forward and on the return line (see Fig. 3). Assuming the average overall heat transfer coefficient k = 50 W m 2 K , taken from Ref. [30], the thermal power exchanged with the external environment can be computed as: (12) Q p i p e s ( t ) = k 1000 2 π R e q 2 L ( T e x t ( t ) − T i ( t ) ) where R e q = 5 π R 2 π is the radius of the delivery manifold tube, and the length L is considered twice to account for the delivery and return paths. The bias present on the sensors at the inlet side of end-users, see Section 3, does not allow one to validate these equations, that are hence tested with the closed-loop temperatures of the delivery and return manifolds in Section 5. 4.2.4 Estimate of the bypass flowrate and hydraulic balance of the loops For the estimation of the bypass flowrate w b p ( t ) and of the flowrate w o f f ( t ) through the chillers in off mode, reference is made to the scheme of Fig. 3. The developments are mainly based on static thermal balances. To this end, preliminarily define w o n ( t ) as the sum of flowrates through the active machines: (13) w o n ( t ) = ∑ i = 1 4 s i ( t ) w c h + s a b s ( t ) w a b s From the mass balance equation of the (primary and secondary) loops, see Fig. 3, we can write: (14) w t ( t ) = w o n ( t ) + w o f f ( t ) = w h o t ( t ) + w b p ( t ) The flowrates w o f f ( t ) and w b p ( t ) account for the mismatch between the water required by the utilities w h o t ( t ) , pumped by a dedicated and independent set of pumps, and w o n ( t ) , that instead is ruled by the control logic of the plant. The estimator of w o f f ( t ) and w b p ( t ) distinguishes two cases, i.e.: \u2022 If w o n ( t ) < w h o t ( t ) , then w b p ( t ) = 0 and w o f f ( t ) = w h o t ( t ) − w o n ( t ) . In this condition, the users require a significant amount of water, and the active machines pump less flow rate, so that w o f f ( t ) > 0, while w b p ( t ) is assumed to be zero. \u2022 If w o n ( t ) > w h o t ( t ) , then w b p ( t ) = − ( w h o t ( t ) − w o n ( t ) ) and w o f f ( t ) = 0 . In this case, the active machines pump more water than that required by users, thus imposing the total flow of the primary loop and forcing a non null value of w b p ( t ) . The flowrate w o f f ( t ) , on the other hand, is null, since active machines provide enough flow to feed the users. In both cases, we can write the thermal balance equation related to the users as (15) T h o t ( t ) = T i ( t ) + Q u ( t ) + Q p i p e s ( t ) ρ w c w w h o t ( t ) Given that no measures of w b p ( t ) and w o f f ( t ) are available, their estimates can be validated only through the temperature predictions obtained from the simulation of the whole plant, as reported in the next section. 5 Closed-loop validation The models of the subsystems have been linked together according to the layout of the plant, see Fig. 3, and a simulator of the overall system has been developed in the Matlab/Simulink environment. The temperature T i ( t ) in the delivery manifold has been computed as follows. First, the auxiliary variable T r o n ( t ) has been computed as the average, weighted by the flow rates, of the temperatures due to the active machines: (16) T r o n ( t ) = ∑ i = 1 4 s i ( t ) T r i ( t ) w c h + s a b s ( t ) T r a b s ( t ) w a b s w o n ( t ) Then, T i ( t ) has been obtained as the weighted contribution of the active machines and of the water passing through the chillers in off mode, that flows at temperature T o ( t ) : (17) T i ( t ) = w o n ( t ) T r o n ( t ) + w o f f ( t ) T o ( t ) w t ( t ) In a similar way, it is possible to compute the temperature T o ( t ) in the return manifold, given by (18) T o ( t ) = w h o t ( t ) T h o t ( t ) + w b p ( t ) T i ( t ) w t ( t ) The transients of T i ( t ) and T o ( t ) , computed with the simulator, are compared to the corresponding measured values in Figs. 15 and 16 , which show the effectiveness of the adopted modelling approach for the overall system. Performances are less satisfactory during the weekend (16\u201318 July) since the chillers are nearly always off, as shown in Fig. 17 , so that the plant is more sensitive to unmodelled disturbances raising from the users and the absorber, that are the only active components. The root mean square error is 0.35\u202f°C for the delivery temperature T i , and 0.5\u202f°C for the return temperature T o . These are acceptable values given the present uncertainty. 6 Control design and performance evaluation The plant is controlled using a relay-based logic, which rules when to switch chillers on and off. The controller includes also a minimal idle time to be observed, denoted by D t , after the switching of a chiller, in order to wait for its effect to completely influence the temperatures and avoid too frequent commutations. The conditions implemented in the control logic and governing the switches are based on T i ( t ) and T o ( t ) , and are reported in the following Tables 1 and 2 , related to the on and off switching cases, respectively. τ \u203e o n , k < τ \u203e o n , k + 1 and τ \u203e o n , k < τ \u203e o n , k + 1 , k = 1,2,3 are tuning parameters, whose values are not reported here for confidentiality reasons. The logic governing the switch off of the chillers is dual.where again τ \u203e o f f , k < τ \u203e o f f , k + 1 and τ \u203e o f f , k < τ \u203e o f f , k + 1 , k = 1,2,3 . Every condition on the temperature must be fulfilled for a period longer than Δ T t e m p = 300 s before producing a switch, and it is possible to switch only one chiller at a time. The subsequent commutation can take place only after a fixed idle time D t , set equal to 10\u202fmin, provided that the associated conditions hold. This is designed to avoid activating chillers only because temperatures are raising suddenly, for example in the early morning when the load increases, but only one chiller is enough to control the system. 6.1 Optimization of the control logic The settings of the parameters of the control logic are manually driven and based on empirical rules. As an alternative, due to the availability of the identified model described in the previous sections, in this paper it is proposed to tune these parameters by solving an optimal control problem. More specifically, we have introduced three optimization variables Δ T o n , Δ T o f f , Δ D t and modified the temperatures thresholds and the idle time as follows: (19) τ \u203e ˜ o n , k = τ \u203e o n , k + Δ T o n τ \u203e ˜ o n , k = τ \u203e o n , k + Δ T o n τ \u203e ˜ o f f , k = τ \u203e o f f , k + Δ T o f f , k = 1,2,3,4 τ \u203e ˜ o f f , k = τ \u203e o f f , k + Δ T o f f D ˜ t = D t + Δ D t The objective function takes into account both the performances of the plant, measured in terms of discomfort, and its running cost. As for the first, since the plant is devoted to serving utilities and satisfying their load demand, we have weighted the mismatch between the cooling power and the load demand in absolute value. Specifically, we have defined the global cooling power provided by the cooling machines as: (20) Q r e f r ( t ) = c w ρ w w t ( t ) ( T i ( t ) − T o ( t ) ) As for the running cost, it is directly proportional to the absorbed power, that has been modelled as described in Section 4.2.1. Therefore, this term must also be included in the cost function. The optimization problem takes the following form: (21) min Δ T o n , Δ T o f f , Δ D t ∫ t 0 t f ∑ i = 1 4 P c h i ( t ) + α | Q u ( t ) + Q p i p e s ( t ) + Q r e f r ( t ) | d t subject to Δ \u203e T o n ≤ Δ T o n ≤ Δ \u203e T o n Δ \u203e T o f f ≤ Δ T o f f ≤ Δ \u203e T o f f Δ \u203e D t ≤ Δ D t ≤ Δ \u203e D t where Δ \u203e T o n , Δ \u203e T o n , Δ \u203e T o f f , Δ \u203e T o f f and Δ \u203e D t , Δ \u203e D t are lower and upper bounds on the optimization variables. The reference week from July 14 t h to 20 t h has been taken as the interval of optimization [ t 0 , t f ] , which is the same period reported for the validation of the models in Figs. 15 and 16. The nonlinear optimization problem has been solved with the fmincon routine available in Matlab. The computed optimal solution is Δ D t o = 0 min , Δ T o n o = 2 o C , Δ T o f f o = 1 o C . From a physical standpoint, the optimized parameters imply that the idle time is not changed, but the thresholds are raised both for the on and off switching. In practice, the chillers switch on when the temperature is higher than before. The control logic has been implemented in the plant simulator, and experiments have been performed with both the original and the optimized control. Some of the results achieved are reported in Fig. 17, which shows that the optimized logic drives the plant to a more regular control pattern, avoiding the switching of the chillers when not necessary, and exploiting completely one chiller in place of having two machines not working at full capability. Indeed, the new thresholds are such that the switching off of one chiller for a short period of time, followed by its new activation, is avoided, see again Fig. 17. A comparison between the current and the optimized logic performances acting on the plant in reported in Table 3 . The table shows that, at the price of an increase of about 2.5 % of the discomfort term | Q u ( t ) + Q p i p e s ( t ) + Q r e f r ( t ) | , the power consumption is reduced of about 30 % , thus motivating the use of the optimized parameters. 7 Conclusions A structured black-box approach for modelling a cooling station serving a large business center has been presented. It relies on a very large data-set employed to derive models of the subsystems composing the plant, eventually connected together according to the actual plant schematic. Modelling performance proved to be satisfactory despite the critical uncertainties present in the problem. Based on the obtained model, the parameters of the currently adopted control logic have been optimized, leading to promising results in terms of energy savings. The proposed approach allows one to quickly model similar plants by suitably composing their constituting subsystems, and the control approach does not require any hardware nor software modification, leading to a simple but effective strategy. Future work will concern both the test on the real plant and the development of a hybrid Model Predictive Controller, possibly with a more intense use of black box estimation techniques, for instance neural networks, to reduce the modelling efforts.

        "dc:description": "The optimal cooling operation of a large business center, with five buildings totalling about 70,000\u202fm2 of interiors, is considered. This problem is relevant due to the high operational costs and energy demand of the cooling system. The latter features four chillers currently managed with heuristic rules. The aim of this study is to redesign the control system to minimize the energy consumption while still meeting the cooling demand. The main challenges are the impossibility to derive a model of the system based on physics, due to its high complexity and lack of information on each subsystem, and the on-off behavior and hysteretic operational constraints of the chillers. To solve this problem, a structured black-box dynamical model of the system is derived using machine learning techniques, exploiting a dataset of more than 500 days of operation. The employed quantities are easily measurable and include the flow rate and temperature of the cooling water, electric power consumption, and external temperature and humidity. Then, the derived model has been used to optimally tune the feedback control strategy via nonlinear programming, by minimizing the predicted energy consumption while satisfying the cooling demand. Simulation results with a validation dataset indicate that the proposed approach achieves an energy saving of 30% with respect to the controller currently adopted, while keeping the temperature in the desired range. The proposed modelling approach, based on data, results in a high applicability to plants with different layouts and components, whenever measurements of the relevant quantities are available.",
