Space cooling constitutes >10% of worldwide electricity consumption and is anticipated to rise swiftly due to intensified heatwaves under emerging climate change. The escalating electricity demand for cooling services will challenge already stressed power grids, especially during peak times of demand. To address this, the adoption of demand response to adjust building energy use on the end-user side becomes increasingly important to adapt future smart buildings with rapidly growing renewable energy sources. However, existing demand response strategies predominantly explore sensible cooling energy as flexible building load while neglecting latent cooling energy, which constitutes significant portions of total energy use of buildings in humid climates. Hence, this paper aims to evaluate the demand response potential by adjusting latent cooling energy through ventilation control for typical medium commercial office buildings in four representative cities across different humid climate zones, i.e., Miami, Huston, Atlanta, and New York in the United States (US). As the first step, the sensible heat ratio, defined as sensible cooling load to total building load (involving both sensible and latent load), in different humid climates are calculated. Subsequently, the strategy to adjust building latent load through ventilation control (LLVC) is explored and implemented for demand response considering the balance of energy shifting, indoor air quality, and energy cost. Results reveal that adjusting building ventilation is capable of achieving 30%\u201340% Heating, Ventilation, and Air-conditioning (HVAC) cooling demand flexibility during HVAC operation while among this, the latent cooling energy contributes 56% ∼ 66.4% to the overall demand flexibility. This work provides a feasible way to improve electricity grid flexibility in humid climates, emphasizing the significant role of adjusting latent cooling energy in building demand response.

In the United States (US), commercial buildings represent as much as 18% of the total energy consumption [2,3]. Given the substantial energy demand of buildings, the US Department of Energy (DOE) prescribes that by 2030, all new federal buildings must be designed to achieve zero net energy [4]. Using renewable energy resources, such as solar energy [5,6], wind energy [7,8], and geothermal energy [9,10], as energy supply to building operation is an important way to reduce fossil fuel-derived building energy consumption and realize the zero net energy goals. Nevertheless, the monitoring and control of these renewable sources are still challenging due to their intermittence and uncertainty by nature, leading to the mismatches between generation and demand in power grid operation [11]. The significant discrepancies potentially result in grid instability, pronounced voltage fluctuations, or even grid failures [12]. Therefore, there is an imperative need to enhance the flexibility in electricity usage of grid-interactive buildings to better integrate diverse renewable energy sources with buildings. Demand response (DR), which is defined as \u201cchanges in electric use by demand side resources from their normal consumption patterns in response to changes in the price of electricity, or to incentive payments designed to induce lower electricity use at times of high wholesale market prices or when system reliability is jeopardized\u201d, is considered as a primary method for enhancing flexibility in electricity usage [13]. Prevailing DR programs, such as critical peak pricing [14] and time-of-use pricing [15], motivate consumers to modify their energy consumption habits based on varied electricity price across the days. This prompts a shift of energy usage from peak time to valley time or a reduction during peak time. DR resources for buildings can be categorized into loads for Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems and loads for non-HVAC systems (e.g., lighting and refrigerator), in which DR strategies for HVAC systems are of great importance since HVAC systems represent a substantial proportion of approximately 40% of total energy consumption in buildings [16]. Additionally, occupants are tolerable with small temperature deviations from neutral temperature setpoints. There are two types of sub-systems in HVAC commonly for DR strategies: 1) air-conditioning systems and 2) ventilation systems. DR strategies for air-conditioning systems can be applied through coordinative operation with energy storage systems and temperature setpoint adjustment. Thermal storage systems enable air-conditioning units to shift operation time off-peak without sacrificing its functioning in indoor environment control. Molavi et al. [17] evaluated the effects of time-of-use tariff on DR programs operation for an industrial customer with thermal energy storage charged by an electric heat pump and they demonstrated that 40\u201350% of electricity load could be reduced. Employing building thermal mass and phase change materials as thermal storage system, Cui et al. [18] found a 34.9% chiller power reduction. Temperature setpoint adjustment of air-conditioning systems also plays a crucial role in DR. Hoyt et al. [19] quantitatively summarized the average energy saving across various climate zones, revealing that raising the cooling temperature setpoint form 22 °C to 30 °C could yield energy saving of around 25%\u201365%. Taking the thermal comfort zone of occupants into consideration, Yin et al. [20] utilized physics-based models to simulate complex thermal dynamics in both commercial and residential buildings. Their findings indicate that the DR potential of adjusting temperature setpoint is correlated with outdoor air temperature and building type, showing that increasing the temperature setpoint from 24 °C to 27 °C could lead to energy saving of 20% in commercial buildings and 50% in residential buildings. However, the DR potential of ventilation systems is significantly lower than the potential for air-conditioning systems. Demand response through ventilation adjustment should consider not only energy consumption but also indoor air quality. The essential idea of demand response in ventilation entails enhancing the ventilation rate outside the peak time and reducing or even ceasing it during peak time. Results reported by Vand et al. [21] and Rotger-Griful et al. [22] indicate demand ventilation saves about 9% and 2% in electricity usage during peak time, respectively. This discrepancy in the DR potential of air-conditioning and ventilation systems may arise because prevailing research primarily focuses on the adjustment of sensible load in ventilation while overlooking the latent load. Although sensible loads could be significant part for HVAC systems to address [23,24], latent loads are also critical, especially in the humid climate zones. Li et al. [25] identified that in the subtropics, the latent cooling load constitutes around 37% of the total cooling load of a residential building, and especially, about 82% of the cooling load by ventilation in a day. Despite the great amount of latent cooling load in humid climate zones, previous studies have largely overlooked the potential of adjustment of building latent load in DR. Therefore, it is still not clear how much latent load, as demand flexibility, can be adjusted through smart control of HVAC system. To bridge the gap, this work aims to 1) evaluate the significance of latent cooling load of typical commercial office buildings in humid climate zones; 2) explore the demand response potential of latent load adjustment through ventilation control (LLVC); 3) present a comparison between DR potential of sensible load and latent load by adjusting air-conditioning temperature and relative humidity setpoints, respectively. To the best knowledge of the authors, this work presents the pioneering comprehensive study to assess the potential of latent load adjustment in HVAC energy demand response, emphasizing the crucial role of latent load in demand response, especially for buildings in the humid climate zones. In Section 2, we will demonstrate the research methodology, including the simulation tool and the detailed LLVC strategy. Section 3 will unveil results of this work, i.e., the proportion of latent cooling load in various climate zones and DR potential of LLVC. Additionally, the DR potential of adjusting sensible and latent load through modifying air-conditioning setpoints will be presented. Section 4 will conclude this study, together with an outlook of DR strategies in humid climate zones. 2 Methodology In this section, we present the principal settings and research methodologies of this study in terms of reference buildings, latent load evaluation, LLVC strategy, and air-conditioning setpoint adjustment strategy, with the comprehensive workflow illustrated in Fig. 1 . To start with, Miami (zone 1A: very hot humid), Houston (zone 2A: hot humid), Atlanta (zone 3A: warm humid), and New York (zone 4A: mixed humid), which are representing major cities in humid climate zones as classified by ASHRAE Standard 169 [26] in the US, are selected for study. Subsequently, reference medium commercial offices from DOE are adopted as the prototype building, as elaborated in Section 2.1. Using the reference buildings, we calculate the latent cooling load in the four humid climate zones (Section 2.2). Since the latent load is strongly related to ventilation rate and humidity setpoint, we then explore the DR potential of LLVC (Section 2.3), considering the balance of energy shifting, indoor air quality, and energy cost. Finally, temperature and humidity setpoint adjustment in HVAC operation are also investigated to compare the sensible load flexibility to the latent one in Section 2.4. 2.1 Reference buildings In this study, medium commercial reference buildings are utilized as prototype building models. These models are developed to represent over 70% of medium office buildings in the US building stock [27,28]. The building is equipped with ideal loads air cooling systems, and exemplified in Figs. 2a-b, showcasing a medium office building with 3 stories and 5 thermal zones per floor, with a total conditioned building area of 4982 m2. Operating hours for the building span from 6:00 to 24:00, conforming to the occupants' schedule detailed in Table 1 , with the highly occupied (fraction >50%) period occurring between 8:00 and 17:00. Note that reference buildings situated in various climate zones have different detailed parameters with respect to envelope materials properties and infiltration rates. Specifically, parameters representing building envelope, thermal mass level, and internal loads, are listed in Table 2 . 2.2 Cooling load and sensible heat ratio (SHR) HVAC systems manage the indoor environment by addressing building loads, i.e., adding or removing required heating or cooling energy from indoor space to maintain a desired temperature for occupants [29]. For instance, in cooling mode, the cooling load refers to the heat that should be extracted from the space, which encompasses heat generated by occupants, lighting, and appliance, heat to cooling the buildings' envelope, and heat entered outdoor air via infiltration and ventilation. Cooling load can be bifurcated into sensible and latent load, depending on the form of heat to be removed. Sensible heat is the heat related to the temperature differences between the exterior and interior of the building, whereas latent heat is generated by the phase change of water vapor contained within the air indoors [27]. The sensible cooling load is used to maintain zone air temperature, while the latent cooling load is employed to stabilize the zone air humidity level. Theoretically, sensible loads are determined by heat balance in a thermal zone, hence, calculated by solving the ordinary differential equations pertinent to the heat balance of the zone air [30]. It is reported that the heat transfer with envelope structures, (ignore the thermal radiation between surface and air because that the infrared emissivity of air is low), is dominated in sensible cooling load [25,31]. Therefore, the U-factors of envelope structures have a great impact on the sensible cooling load. On the other hand, the latent cooling load can be calculated by: v d v a dt = ∑ i = 1 N i G i + ∑ j = 1 S j A j g j + G inf + G v + G l , (1) Q l = G l h p w r − w set where v is the volume of zoom air [m3]; v a is the vapor content of the interior air [kg/m3]; G i is the internal moisture gains from occupants [kg/s]; g j is the moisture flux into the room from surface j [kg/(s\u2027m2)]; G inf and G v are the moisture from the outside air infiltration and ventilation, respectively [kg/s]; G l is the moisture gain or loss due to air-conditioning systems [kg/s]; h p is the enthalpy change of water vapor condensation [J/kg]; w r and w set are the humidity ratio of air and air-conditioning setpoint, respectively [kg water/kg dry air]. For a constructed building, both the infiltration rate and occupant density are non-adjustable, so the air humidity ratio setpoint and ventilation rate are two crucial factors for adjusting the latent cooling load, which will be further discussed in Section 3.1. To compare the sensible cooling load with the latent cooling load, one can simply consider the ratio between them, hereby defined as the Sensible Heat Ratio (SHR): (2) SHR = Q s Q s + Q l . The SHR defined here can represent the relative quantity of sensible and latent loads, and more importantly, the humidity level of a climate zone. For example, in the dry climate zone with a Q l approximates zero, SHR could approach its up-limit 1, while in the humid climate zone with a larger Q l , SHR would decline and converge to zero at the limit condition of Q l ≫ Q s . 2.3 Adjust building latent load through ventilation control This section elucidates the principle of LLVC, inherently tied to the tradeoff among energy shifting, indoor air quality, and energy cost. Intuitively, achieving maximum energy shifting could be realized by shutting the ventilation system down during peak time. However, LLVC aims to shift energy consumption from peak hours without compromising the indoor air quality, i.e., maintaining sufficient ventilation rate within occupied room spaces. Therefore, we firstly present the ventilation requirements for acceptable indoor air quality in Section 2.3.1. ASHRAE Standard 62.1 [32] defines a permitted time period during which the ventilation rate is allowed to be averaged to meet indoor air quality requirements. During these periods, any reduction in ventilation rate in one period must be counterbalanced by an increased ventilation rate in another, implying potentially higher energy use, especially for the fans of the ventilation system. According to the affinity laws of fans, the energy consumption of ventilation is cubically and positively correlated with the ventilation rate. Given that electricity price is time-variant in most DR programs, enhancing the ventilation rate within a concise period might lead to a substantial increase in the total energy consumption, thus a higher total electricity price. Nevertheless, from the perspective of end-use customers, the total electricity cost after employing LLVC should not exceed that before. This tradeoff between indoor air quality, energy shifting, and energy cost will be discussed in Section 2.3.2, together with the flexibility of ventilation rate and HVAC DR potential of LLVC quantified in Section 2.3.3. 2.3.1 Indoor air quality and time-averaged ventilation Indoor air quality profoundly impacts human health and correlates with indoor pollutants such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, and particular matter [33]. Additionally, higher indoor carbon dioxide concentrations are usually regarded as indicators of suboptimal indoor air quality [34,35]. However, scant evidence suggests that carbon dioxide levels below 5000 ppm influence perceived air quality [36], and ASHRAE Standard has not stipulated an indoor carbon dioxide limit for nearly three decades. Consequently, this work does not quantify indoor air quality via carbon dioxide concentration as indicators. Instead, we utilize the designed time-averaged ventilation rate for commercial buildings as specified in ASHRAE Standard 62.1, Section 6.2 [32] for subsequent analysis. Specifically, Section 6.2.5.2 (Short-Term Conditions) states that the average airflow should meet the designed ventilation rate requirement V d over a period of time T a , during which the minimum ventilation rate is permissible to be zero [37,38]. The designed ventilation rate requirement can be calculated as follows: (3) V d = ∑ i N zone R pi P zi + R ai A zi , where A zi is the zone floor area [m2]; P zi is the zone population [−]; R pi is the airflow rate required per person [m3/s/person]; R ai is airflow rate required per unit area [m/s]. R pi and R ai are suggested in ASHRAE Standard 62.1 [32], which is related to the type of commercial buildings. Here we take R pi of 2.5 × 10−3 m3/s/person and R ai of 3 × 10−4 m/s for commercial office. Since the number of occupants is determined by the building occupants schedule α , the designed ventilation rate fraction can be calculated by Eq. 4 and presented in Table 3 : (4) F vi = α R pi P zi + R ai A zi R pi P zi + R ai A zi , where F vi is the ventilation rate fraction in zone i [−]; α is the occupant schedule, which is given in the DOE reference medium commercial office building (Table 1). Moreover, in the LLVC case (Fig. 3 ), it is known that the peak occupancy will be of short duration, and the ventilation will be varied or interrupted for a brief period. Thus, the design should be based on the average conditions over a time period T a [32] determined by: (5) T a = 50 v V d , where v is the volume of the ventilation zone where averaging is being applied [m3]. This equation suggests that the permitted average time T a would be shorter, implying a stricter ventilation requirement, when the zone volume v is small or the required ventilation rate V d is large. The T a establishes a time range within which LLVC can be applied, implying that the total ventilation rate should remain constant after the implementation of LLVC: (6) ∫ V shift T shift dt + ∫ V shed T shed dt = ∫ F v V d T a dt , where V shift and V shed are ventilation rate during the shifting time T shift and shedding time T shed , and T shift + T shed = T a . This equation provides the constraint on the designed ventilation rate and shedding time when applying the LLVC strategy. One can decrease or shut down the ventilation rate during the shedding time, but this reduction must be compensated during a prior or subsequent shifting time with a higher ventilation rate to meet the total ventilation rate requirement for a healthy indoor environment over the permitted average time T a . Clearly, the time for shedding the ventilation rate cannot surpass T a . From this viewpoint, maximum energy shifting might be realized as the ventilation rate shedding time asymptotically approaches T a . However, this will be constrained by the energy power of fans during the shifting time, which will be discussed in the following section. 2.3.2 Fans energy consumption and time-of-use electricity price When the shedding time approaches T a , the maximum energy shifting is constrained by the energy power of fans PF = K η V 3 , where K is the characteristic of the duct section [Pa/(m3/s)2] and η is the fan efficiency [−]. The effect of heat exchanger and filter in the fan system are not considered, which is a second-order polynomial forms with respect to air flow rate [39]. In this work, we assume that K = 0.002 Pa/(m3/h)2 and η = 0.9. Apparently, the power of a fan is positively related to the cube of the ventilation rate V . Therefore, the ventilation shedding time cannot be excessively prolonged or else the air flow rate of fan during the shifting time must be substantially increased to preserve the required average ventilation rate over time, leading to significantly increased energy use and electricity cost. However, the electricity price is not a constant in most DR programs, which makes LLVC process more complicated. Most DR programs adopt a time-of-use electricity pricing model [40\u201342]. By assigning varied prices throughout the day, utility companies can incentivize customers to shift their demand to off-peak hours, thereby flattening the demand curve. The time-of-use electricity price and its applicable periods are determined by local utility companies and are influenced by numerous factors, including electricity network constraints and the wholesale electricity prices. In this study, we have selected four representative local utility companies, which are the largest local utility provider in studied areas, i.e., Florida Power & Light Company for Miami, TXU Energy for Houston, Georgia Power for Atlanta, and Consolidated Edison for New York. Detailed information is provided in Table 4 . Fig. 4 displays the time-of-use electricity prices, occupants' schedules, and ventilation schedules. Take Fig. 4a for example, T 2 represents the shedding time within the peak time of 12:00\u201321:00, while T 1 denotes the shifting time within the valley time, and they should meet the requirement of T 1 + T 2 = T a . An acceptable total electricity price after applying LLVC should comply with the following constraint: (7) ∫ t 1 t 2 E ac t + E v t · p 1 t · dt + ∫ t 2 t 3 E ac t + E v t · p 2 t · dt ≤ p 0 , where t 1 ∼ t 2 is the shifting time [s]; t 2 ∼ t 3 is the shedding time [s]; E ac t is the energy consumption for air-conditioning [kWh]; E v t is the ventilation energy consumption [kWh]; p 1 t and p 2 t are time-related electricity prices [\u20ac/kWh]; p 0 is the original total electricity use cost without LLVC [\u20ac]. Note that E c t and E v t are time-dependent due to their strong correlation with the ventilation rate. For simplification, we assume LLVC rates during the shifting time V shift and shedding time V shed both remain constant. Consequently, the acceptable ventilation rate during shedding time V a , can be determined by Eq. 7. 2.3.3 Ventilation rate flexibility and HVAC DR potential Flexibility, describing the extent to which one portion of load can be adjusted during DR period, is pivotal in evaluating DR strategies [47]. In LLVC strategy, the flexibility of ventilation rate and HVAC energy consumption (HVAC DR potential) should be quantified. The flexibility of ventilation rate, denotes as f ven , can be expressed as follows: (8) f v = V d − V shed V d . Considering the limit behavior of f v , it is equal to 1 when V shed can be reduced to zero, representing the maximal adjustable range of V shed (0- V d ). Conversely, f v is 0 when V shed equals V d , indicating an inability to adjust the ventilation rate during the shedding time. Apart from the flexibility of ventilation rate, HVAC DR potential quantifies the flexibility of HVAC energy consumption during the DR duration, and can be defined as: (9) DR = E base − E DR E base where E base and E DR are HVAC energy consumption before and after applying DR strategies, respectively; E base − E DR is the energy shifting during DR. With smaller E DR , a higher DR potential can be achieved, and it is also a normalized parameter range from 0 to 1, whose boundary is corresponding to the situation where E DR = E base and E DR = 0 . 2.4 DR by air-conditioning setpoint adjustment Latent cooling energy is significantly influenced by both ventilation rate and relative humidity setpoint. Hence, in addition to developing LLVC as the alternative DR strategy for ventilation rate adjustment, this section explores the adjustment of air-conditioning humidity setpoint to realize latent cooling energy demand response. For comparison of the sensible load DR potential and the latent one, the adjustment of temperature setpoint for sensible load demand response is also investigated. A straightforward strategy of global thermostat adjustments is implemented, where a singular master thermostat controls the entire building [48]. The boundaries for adjusting temperature and humidity setpoint are decided by thermal comfort condition stipulated in ASHRAE Standard 55 [49]. As a mental condition denoting satisfaction with the thermal environment, thermal comfort of occupants should not be sacrificed during demand response since it negatively affects health and productivity of occupants [50,51]. Assuming thermal resistance of occupants' clothing is 0.5 clo in the summer season, the deadband of temperature setpoint ranges from 24 °C to 27 °C at an indoor relative humidity of 50%, while the humidity setpoint below 62% when indoor temperature is 24 °C. It's imperative to note that low relative humidity is associated with the skin dryness, mucous membranes issues, and sensory irritation of the eyes and upper airways [52], while high relative humidity risks include microbial growth [53] and an increase in house dust mites [54]. A relative humidity range of 40\u201360% is reported to be optimal for maintaining indoor human health [55]. Therefore, we designated a humidity setpoint range of 40%\u201360% as the boundary for demand response. Fig. 4b illustrates the setpoint adjustment strategy in Miami, wherein the setpoint is established as the lower limit during valley time and shifted during peak time. The setpoint schedule is determined by the time-of-use electricity price. Taking climate zone 1A for instance, the setpoint will be fixed at a lower value (24 °C for temperature setpoint and 40% for relative humidity setpoint) during 6:00\u201312:00 and 21:00\u201324:00, and a higher value (27 °C for temperature setpoint and 60% for relative humidity setpoint) during 12:00\u201321:00. Setpoint schedule for other cities in climate zones 2A-4A can be referenced by their time-of-use electricity prices, as illustrated in Table 4. The DR potential obtained by this strategy can also be calculated with Eq. 9. 3 Results and discussion This section shows the results derived from the methodologies applied in this study, followed by a discussion. First, we evaluate the latent cooling load in humid climates zones in Section 3.1. Then, the DR potential related to LLVC and air-conditioning setpoint adjustment are explored in Section 3.2 and Section 3.3, respectively. 3.1 Latent cooling load and SHR evaluation In this section, latent cooling energy and the SHR for cities spanning four different humid climate zones are calculated. Fig. 5 illustrates the monthly average latent cooling energy in August, plotted against humidity setpoint and ventilation rate during the active air-conditioning period of 6:00\u201324:00. As we discussed above, the humidity setpoint spans a range of 40%\u201360%. Regarding ventilation rate, it's noted that the designed ventilation rate V d , as calculated by Eq. 3, is 4.25 × 10−4 m3/s per area, allowing us to set the ventilation rate range as 0\u20130.001 m3/s per area. The result for the hot and humid climate zone 1A is depicted in Fig. 5a. It indicates that the latent cooling energy peaks at around 350 GJ and increases with the rising of ventilation rate and reduction of humidity setpoint. Comparing the latent cooling energy between Houston (peak value of 340 GJ) and Miami reveals a slight reduction, attributed to the analogous humidity level in these cities in August. Nonetheless, when compared to Miami, Atlanta (peak value of 270 GJ) and New York (peak value of 188 GJ) experienced notable reduction of 22.9% and 46.3%, respectively. Results underscore the dual-edged nature of ventilation: while imperative for maintaining indoor air quality, augmented ventilation rate in a humid climate zone can lead to a substantial air-conditioning cooling load due to increased latent heat. This can be inferred from Eq. 1. assuming the humidity setpoint remains unchanged and the rate of vapor content change with respect to time ( d v a / dt ) in the building is constant. The moisture gains ( G v ) in each thermal zone through ventilation should be balanced by the moisture loss ( G l ) through the air-conditioning dehumidification systems, resulting in a lager latent load ( Q l ). Furthermore, a lower humidity setpoint ( w set ) means a larger gap of humidity level between external and internal environment, together with an increased latent cooling load ( Q l = G l h p w r − w set ). Consequently, with higher latent load in Miami (climate zone 1A) and Houston (2A), it's reasonable to hypothesize that these climates have higher HVAC DR potential to shift latent cooling energy. Fig. 6 shows the SHR in relation to humidity setpoint and ventilation rate during the defined air-conditioning operational period 6:00\u201324:00. Contrary to the latent cooling load, SHR is influenced by the sensible cooling energy, which is inherently related to variables such as outdoor temperature, solar radiation, and indoor activities. Valley values of SHR for the cities located in climate zone from 1A to 4A are recorded as 0.38, 0.40, 0.42, and 0.49, respectively, with Miami in climate zone 1A exhibiting the lowest SHR. Thus, in climate zones with higher humidity level (e.g., climate zone 1A), latent cooling energy is more significant (>60% of total building HVAC load) compared to sensible cooling energy in daily building operation. The peak value of latent cooling load in Fig. 5 corresponds to the valley value of SHR in Fig. 6 (at the condition where the humidity setpoint is 40% and the outdoor air intake rate is 1 L/(s·m2)), because SHR is inversely proportional to the latent cooling energy ( SHR = 1 / 1 + Q l / Q s ). Furthermore, SHR exhibits a non-linear relationship with ventilation rate, inferring that SHR will converge to a particular value even with continued enhancement in ventilation rate, potentially due to the simultaneously increased sensible cooling energy with large ventilation rate. 3.2 Flexibility and DR potential of LLVC This section shows the results of LLVC strategy, in which Section 3.2.1 gives the flexibility of ventilation rate of LLVC, Section 3.2.2 presents the energy shifting and HVAC DR potential. Finally, we select a weekday in August to show the change of total energy consumption after adopting LLVC in Section 3.2.3. 3.2.1 Flexibility of ventilation rate To leverage the considerable amount of latent cooling loads in the humid climate zones, the LLVC strategy is identified as a practical way to explore the DR potential of adjusting latent cooling load. Turning off the ventilation system during the peak time with higher electricity price can directly reduce the HVAC energy consumption by cutting the energy used by fans and air conditioning. However, this approach could lead to unacceptable indoor air quality as described in Section 2.3.1. To safeguard a healthy indoor environment for occupants, the designed ventilation rate V d within a building is stipulated by ASHRAE Standard 62.1, to be maintained over a permitted average time T a . As shown in Fig. 3, strategically lowing the ventilation rate during the peak time, and raising it during the valley time with a lower electricity price is an effective way to reduce overall electricity expenses without sacrifice of the indoor air quality by holding a constant average ventilation rate. In this picture, it is important to determine the shedding time T shed and the ventilation rate during shedding time V shed . The range of T shed is constrained by the permitted average time T a ( 0 ≤ T shed ≤ T a ). The upper limit of V shed is V d when the LLVC is not adopted, while the lower limit of V shed is constrained by the energy consumption of fans. As discussed in Section 2.3.2, energy consumption of fans is cubically and positively correlated with the ventilation rate. If the V shed is so small that the ventilation rate during the valley time should be large enough to keep a constant average ventilation rate (see Eq. 6), the energy consumption of fans during the valley time will increase dramatically, leading to a higher total electricity cost than before even if the electricity price during the valley time is lower. From the perspective of end-use customers, the expected total electricity cost after adopting demand response strategy cannot exceed that before. Thus, the ventilation rate during shedding time V shed is constrained as denoted in Eq. 7, and its minimum value is established where the total electricity cost after LLVC is equal to that before. This limit value is the acceptable minimum ventilation rate V a during shedding time with V a ≤ V shed ≤ V d . The acceptable minimum ventilation rate during shedding time V a is calculated by Eq. 7. The black line in Fig. 7 shows the V a and the ventilation rate flexibility across four cities versus ventilation shedding time. Notably, these curves can be divided into two stages, enabling us to define a transition time point t s : before t s , V a and the flexibility remain constant ( V a = 0 m/s and f v = 1), thereafter V a ascends while flexibility decreases. With a ventilation shedding time before t s , the V a is allowed to reach zero, concurrently allowing maximum flexibility of 1, i.e., before t s , we can eliminate all ventilation without worrying excessive cost after turning ventilation back after shedding time, and still meet the indoor air quality requirements by ASHRAE 62.1. During this stage, the constraint from Eq. 7 dictates the energy consumption during the shifting time ( E ac + E v ) should not exceed a constant ( p 0 / p 1 ). However, when the ventilation shedding time is extensively prolonged, the shifting time is reduced ( T shift = T a − T shed ). Consequently, the ventilation rate during the shifting time ( V shift = F v V a T a / T shift ) as well as the ventilation energy consumption ( E v ) will dramatically increase, resulting in an unacceptable total electricity cost. To avoid such excessive cost, the ventilation rate during the shedding period ( V shed ) is increased. During this stage, the ventilation rate during the shifting time is calculated as V shift = F v V a T a − V shed T shed / T shift . The limit condition is that when shedding time approaches the permitted averaging time T a , i.e., the loss of ventilation rate in shedding hours cannot be compensated, the V a then is non-adjustable from the designed ventilation rate V d to maintain indoor air quality, indicating a flexibility of zero. This behavior is influenced by cooling energy, the discrepancy of electricity price between peak and valley time, and the duration of the peak time. To be more explicit, when the cooling energy is large, changes in the ventilation rate would have less impact on energy shifting. This is because the amount of cooling energy changes is in direct proportion to the ventilation rate. However, fan energy use increases at a much faster rate than the ventilation rate does. Considering a scenario where the cooling energy use is much larger than the fan energy use, it's possible to keep the V a at zero. The reason behind this is mathematical: for any average value of a variable that remains constant over a period, a linear function of this variable will also stay constant. Therefore, even the V a is as small as zero, the total energy use will be same as before in this case. The electricity price difference between peak and valley times is notably impactful: a big gap implies that electricity price shedding is much larger than that in shifting time, thus easily satisfying the Eq. 7. In addition, the duration of the peak time is related to the limit behavior in V a and t s calculation. When the peak time length exceeds T a , flexibility can entirely converge to zero, i.e., there is no room to adjust ventilation for demand response due to indoor air quality constraints. 3.2.2 HVAC energy shifting and DR potential HVAC energy shifting and DR potential are critical to evaluate DR strategies. Utilizing the acceptable minimum ventilation rate V a values obtained before, HVAC energy shifting ( E base − E DR ), and DR potential ( E base − E DR / E base ) can be calculated as demonstrated in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9 . The data for energy shifting illustrates a linear increase preceding the transition time t s and a non-linear decline after t s , and they have peak values at t s of 327 MJ, 323 MJ, 265 MJ, and 239 MJ in Miami, Houston, Atlanta, and New York, respectively. The overall DR potential incorporating sensible cooling loads, latent cooling loads, and ventilation energy remains constant before the transition time t s and decline non-linearly after the t s , with the plateau values before t s are 42.5%, 43.1%, 38.6%, and 29.1% in Miami, Houston, Atlanta, and New York, respectively. Moreover, Fig. 9 shows the contribution from different HVAC energy types to the overall DR potential. The contribution from sensible cooling energy, which correlates to the outdoor temperature, is small in four climate zones, especially in New York at humid climate zone 4A (5.5%). Contributions by latent cooling energy to the overall DR potential related to HVAC energy use are dominated (> 50% in all climate zones): 66.4%, 63.8%, 61.4%, and 56% in Miami, Houston, Atlanta, and New York, respectively, inferring that the latent cooling load is pivotal in the demand response strategies. Moreover, the percentage of constitution of latent cooling load is in the order of climate zone 1A, 2A, 3A, and 4A, showing the LLVC is particularly advantageous in the hot humid climate zone with high humidity levels (e.g., climate zones 1A and 2A). A noteworthy observation is the similarity in energy shifting and DR potential between Miami and Houston, both of which are larger than values in Atlanta and New York. This is owing to their high temperature and humidity levels. The DR potential of the ventilation systems in humid climate zones (30\u201340%) is largely underestimated by that in previous works because they overlook the critical role played by the latent load. Therefore, DR strategies for buildings in humid climate zones should consider not only sensible thermal storage systems but also the dehumidification techniques. Dehumidification plays a crucial role in HVAC for providing a comfort indoor environment, particularly in regions with high humidity [56,57]. By actively or passively removing moisture from the air, dehumidification reduces the latent load, which is demonstrated as a significant component of the total cooling load in humid climates in this work. This reduction in latent load decreases the overall HVAC energy consumption required for air conditioning, thus enabling more effective load management and shifting. For instance, dehumidification systems can be optimized to run during valley time to pre-dehumidify the air, reducing the need for energy-intensive air conditioning during peak time. Moreover, advanced dehumidification technologies, such as desiccant-based systems [58], can be integrated with existing HVAC systems to enhance their efficiency. These systems can precondition the air by removing moisture before it enters the cooling coil, thereby reducing the additional cooling load. Incorporating dehumidification techniques into DR strategies would not only help in flattening the demand curve but also provide a more resilient and flexible approach in energy management. 3.2.3 Energy consumption adjustment by LLVC To illustrate the variety in energy consumption after adopting LLVC, August 15th was selected as a representative day, utilizing a shedding time of 3 h for analysis. Fig. 10 presents the total energy consumption before and after implementing LLVC across four cities. The chosen shedding time is selected as the initial 3 h of peak times specific to each city: 12:00\u201314:00 in Miami, 13:00\u201315:00 in Houston, 14:00\u201316:00 in Atlanta, and 8:00\u201310:00 in New York. According to Section 3.2.1, the acceptable ventilation rate V a can be zero across all climate zones when adopting a shedding time of 3 h. Also, due to the lower sensitivity of the sensible cooling load to ventilation rate compared to the latent load, LLVC exhibits negligible impact on sensible cooling energy. In contrast, latent cooling energy shows an obvious decrease during shedding time and an increase during shifting time. There is still a minor amount of latent cooling energy that persists during shedding time, attributed to the latent gain from occupants. Moreover, ventilation energy rises dramatically during shifting time, as a two-fold increase in ventilation rate can cause an eight-fold augmentation in ventilation energy. In New York (Fig. 10h), the ventilation energy is smaller than other climate zones because the permitted averaging time zone is 5:00\u201310:00, when the ventilation requirement is small due to lower occupied schedule. 3.3 HVAC DR potential by air-conditioning setpoint adjustment By adjusting the temperature and humidity setpoint, the DR potential is elucidated as Figs. 11a-b. Altering the temperature setpoint can realize around 30\u201350% DR potential across four cities, while adjustments to the humidity setpoint can yield 30\u201340%, which implies that the latent load cannot be neglected in the DR strategy, compared with the sensible load. The DR potential achieved by adjusting temperature setpoint from high to low varies across cities, with the order being Miami, Atlanta, Houston, and New York. However, when adjusting the humidity setpoint, Atlanta slightly surpasses the other cities in DR potential. Note that the setpoint adjustment strategy here embraces the upper limit; in most of the scenarios, the temperature setpoint might be set higher than the lower boundary required for human thermal comfort (24 °C), such as 25 °C or 26 °C. In addition, DR potential is a relative metric, interconnected with many parameters such as U factors of building envelope, the solar heat gain coefficient of window, outdoor climate [20,59], infiltration rate, and thermal mass in buildings. For example, while adjusting the temperature setpoint, the rate of indoor temperature variation is decided by the thermal mass and envelope of buildings. The setpoint adjustment strategy could also be more complicated than explored in this work, which needs further research in future. 4 Conclusion and outlook This work comprehensively explores the potential of shifting latent cooling energy for demand response in four representative cities across various humid climates zones, i.e., Miami (1A), Houston (2A), Atlanta (3A), and New York (4A). After evaluating latent cooling energy by high fidelity building modeling, we developed and analyzed a LLVC strategy to shift this substantial latent cooling energy by adjustment of the ventilation rate during the peak time and valley time. Then, we discussed flexibility of the ventilation rate and HVAC DR potential of the LLVC strategy, especially the contribution from the latent cooling energy out of total demand flexibility. The HVAC DR potential by adjusting the temperature and humidity setpoint are also compared. Firstly, the latent cooling energy and SHR in different cities versus ventilation rate and humidity setpoint are calculated, demonstrating that Miami has the highest latent cooling energy of 350 GJ and the lowest SHR of 0.38 in August. Secondly, we analyze the LLVC considering the tradeoff among energy shifting, indoor air quality, and energy cost. Implementing a LLVC strategy enables up to 30%\u201340% HVAC DR potential (where the latent cooling loads account for over 50% of this overall HVAC DR potential) across four climate zones. Then, the HVAC DR potential of humidity setpoint adjustment is quantified, with 30%\u201340% of HVAC energy being able to shift around in different climate zones and cities. Therefore, the considerable latent cooling load is a non-negligible part to consider in demand response, especially in the humid climate zones. This work serves to evaluate DR potential of latent cooling load in humid climate zones, which will also shed light on the research on DR strategies and the dehumidification methods in these climate zones. Finally, future research outlook is encapsulated as follows: 1) Exploring separated cooling systems and their energy saving potential. While this work employs the idea loads air systems for investigation, direct expansion (DX) cooling systems prevail in existing HVAC setups. DX cooling systems, however, cannot provide independent sensible and latent cooling due to the concurrent temperature and humidity reduction during the cooling coil process. Even if the temperature of supply air meets with the setpoint, the cooling coil will keep working to condense the water vapor in air until it meets the humidity setpoint, which may lead to unwanted additional cooling load. Separated cooling system is a promising way to address this problem [60], such as evaporative cooling, radiant cooling, and desiccant materials, whose potential for DR application are worth further investigation. 2) Addressing diverse occupants' schedules for LLVC. While the target building in this study is a medium reference commercial building, in which the occupants' schedule is relatively simple as the office building is occupied only during working time. Nevertheless, Other types of buildings, such as malls or apartments, could operate with more complicated occupancy patterns. In such a situation, integrating the LLVC into a control system is imperative for optimizing demand response performance.

        "dc:description": "Space cooling constitutes >10% of worldwide electricity consumption and is anticipated to rise swiftly due to intensified heatwaves under emerging climate change. The escalating electricity demand for cooling services will challenge already stressed power grids, especially during peak times of demand. To address this, the adoption of demand response to adjust building energy use on the end-user side becomes increasingly important to adapt future smart buildings with rapidly growing renewable energy sources. However, existing demand response strategies predominantly explore sensible cooling energy as flexible building load while neglecting latent cooling energy, which constitutes significant portions of total energy use of buildings in humid climates. Hence, this paper aims to evaluate the demand response potential by adjusting latent cooling energy through ventilation control for typical medium commercial office buildings in four representative cities across different humid climate zones, i.e., Miami, Huston, Atlanta, and New York in the United States (US). As the first step, the sensible heat ratio, defined as sensible cooling load to total building load (involving both sensible and latent load), in different humid climates are calculated. Subsequently, the strategy to adjust building latent load through ventilation control (LLVC) is explored and implemented for demand response considering the balance of energy shifting, indoor air quality, and energy cost. Results reveal that adjusting building ventilation is capable of achieving 30%\u201340% Heating, Ventilation, and Air-conditioning (HVAC) cooling demand flexibility during HVAC operation while among this, the latent cooling energy contributes 56% ∼ 66.4% to the overall demand flexibility. This work provides a feasible way to improve electricity grid flexibility in humid climates, emphasizing the significant role of adjusting latent cooling energy in building demand response.",
