State Key Laboratory of Fluid Power and Mechatronic Systems Zhejiang University Hangzhou 310027 China The development of deep learning (DL) technology provides an opportunity for accurate prediction and effective control of complex building systems. However, despite the high prediction performance of DL models, few studies integrate DL with the model predictive control (MPC) algorithm for improving building management. In this study, a DL-based MPC framework using encoder-decoder recurrent neural network is developed for real-time control of building thermal environment to exploit the advantage of both DL and MPC algorithms. In addition, to simulate the dynamic interaction between indoor airflow and HVAC systems, a co-simulation platform by integrating HVAC simulator and CFD model is developed to evaluate the proposed building control strategy. Two case studies including a confined space with mixing ventilation and an office room subjected to solar radiation are used for validation of the proposed method. The performance of the DL-based MPC algorithm for building thermal environment control is compared with the traditional proportion-integration-differentiation (PID) controller and the adaptive PID controller. Approximately 4% and 7% energy savings are achieved on average through DL-based MPC compared with adaptive and conventional PID control, respectively. The proposed DL-based MPC framework shows a promising application prospect for building automationby taking the advantage of both deep learning and MPC algorithms. Keywords Model predictive control Recurrent neural networks Thermal environment Computational fluid dynamics Smart control 1 Introduction The building sector is a major energy consumer in modern society, accounting for more than 30% of global final energy consumption [1]. Building automation and control systems are critical to improving building energy efficiency while ensuring a healthy and comfortable built environment [2,3\u20135] Numerous control strategies, such as fuzzy control [6,7], proportion-integration-differentiation (PID) control [8,9], and model predictive control (MPC) [10\u201313], etc., have been investigated to be applied for efficient operation of building systems in the past decade. In particular, increasing attention is paid to the MPC controller, due to its great advantage to realize optimal control and to deal with the trade-off among multiple control objectives [14]. It has been reported that approximately 15%\u201332% of building energy savings could be achieved using the MPC controller [15,16]. An accurate building model is of great importance for efficient MPC operation. Physics-based building models and data-driven models are the current two major approaches for constructing building models [17\u201319]. As for the physics-based building models, exhaustive prior knowledge about the buildings (e.g., occupant distribution and thermal conductance of building thermal mass) is required, which limits the widespread use of the physics-based model for MPC in real applications. In recent years, data-driven techniques, especially machine learning (ML) techniques have drawn great attention due to their great capacity in constructing complex nonlinear building models without reliance on domain knowledge related to building physics [20\u201322]. In the past decade, ML techniques including regression trees (RT), random forests (RF), and neural networks (NN) have been extensively investigated to construct building models and to be integrated with the MPC framework for building thermal environment control (Table 1 ). For example, Smarra et al. developed an MPC controller using an RF-based building model and demonstrated that the RF-based MPC had comparable performance to the physics-based model in terms of control accuracy [23]. Ferreira et al. implemented NN-based MPC to optimize building indoor thermal comfort and energy consumption, and demonstrated that more than 50% energy savings were achieved compared with the fixed setpoint control [24]. Yang et al. developed an MPC controller based on an adaptive NN-based model for real-time control of building thermal environment, and demonstrated that the control accuracy increased over time due to the improved accuracy of the adaptive models [25]. Drgoňa et al. utilized NN and RT to construct an approximate model predictive control law [26]. Behl et al. employed RT-based MPC to construct demand a response recommender system for commercial buildings and demonstrated that the RT-based MPC controller outperformed the rule-based controller by 17% [27]. Afram et al. used an NN-based MPC controller for efficient operation of the HVAC systems, and approximately 6%\u201373% savings of operation cost was achieved compared to the fixed setpoint strategy [28]. Bunning et al. proposed RF-based MPC to control room temperature and showed that 24.9% of cooling energy could be reduced [29]. Hilliard et al. used the RF model to construct whole building MPC for building energy savings [30]. Chen et al. used NN-based MPC for the efficient operation of hybrid ventilation [31]. Reynolds et al. combined NN and model predictive control to minimize building energy consumption and showed that the NN-based MPC framework was able to adapt to the dynamic electricity price variations [32]. However, most of these previous studies focused on MPC in combination with shallow ML methods. Deep learning techniques (DL) such as long short-term memory network (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit network (GRU) have been developing quickly in the past decade, and have demonstrated great performance in modeling complex nonlinear systems [33]. Extensive studies have been investigating the application of the LSTM and/or GRU models for predicting building thermal load [34] and building energy load [35] in real applications. Moreover, in Ref. [36], Wang et al. compared the prediction performance between shallow ML and DL models, and it was demonstrated that the LSTM network significantly outperformed the shallow ML method for short-term predictions. However, despite the high prediction accuracy of DL-based building models, few studies integrated DL with MPC for HVAC control [37]. Moreover, for effective evaluation of the building control strategies, it is of great importance to provide an accurate dynamic simulation platform. Simulators including EnergyPlus [38\u201340], TRNSYS [41], Modelica [42,43] and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) [44] have been widely used for investigation of building systems for improved thermal comfort and energy savings. However, the assumption of well-mixed indoor air limits the capacity of simulators, including EnergyPlus, TRNSYS, and Modelica, for accurate indoor temperature estimation. On the other hand, the CFD method is able to provide information about indoor airflow distribution but fails to consider the dynamic interactions between indoor airflow and HVAC systems [45]. Few previous studies constructed coupled simulations to evaluate the efficiency of building control algorithms [46]. For example, Gowreesunker et al. used TRNSYS and CFD to simulate the PID controlled HVAC system and the indoor environment in the airport terminal space respectively [47]. Du et al. coupled TRNSYS and CFD simulation to improve the variable air volume (VAV) terminal control [48]. Tian et al. integrated fast fluid dynamics (FFD) and Modelica for real-time control of indoor temperature using PID control and determined the optimal sensor placement based on the co-simulation platform [45]. Ascione et al. investigated the HVAC systems based on the BES-CFD co-simulation platform and demonstrated that the coupled simulation approach could improve the performance of indoor microclimatic control [49]. Fan et al. used the PID controller to minimize the temperature fluctuation in the office and analyzed the energy conservation performance of office space with an energy recovery ventilator by coupling TRNSYS and CFD simulation [50]. It should be noted that, up to now, there are no studies evaluating the MPC performance using the coupled simulation approach. In this study, a DL-based MPC framework is proposed for real-time control of building thermal environment to exploit the advantage of both DL and MPC algorithms. The main contributions of this work are summarized as follows: 1) To simulate the dynamic interaction between indoor airflow and HVAC systems, this study develops a co-simulation platform by integrating HVAC simulator and CFD model, which provides an effective and accurate solution for evaluating the proposed control strategy. 2) To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that puts forward a DL-based MPC framework for real-time control of building thermal environment. Specifically, the DL-based model is conducted based on the encoder-decoder recurrent neural networks (RNN), which is then embedded into the MPC framework to construct a feedback loop. Moreover, our study would investigate how to train this RNN model efficiently in the DL-based MPC framework. 3) Two case studies including a confined space with mixing ventilation and an office room subjected to solar radiation are used for validation of the proposed method. In addition, the performance of the DL-based MPC controller is compared with the traditional PID controller and the adaptive PID controller to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy. The rest of this work is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the DL-based MPC framework and describes how to integrate the DL model into the MPC framework. Section 3 describes the co-simulation platform and Section 4 provides the detailed description of two case studies including a confined space with mixing ventilation and an office room subjected to solar radiation. Section 5 discusses the results of the two case studies respectively. Section 6 discusses the advantages and limitations of the proposed DL-based MPC method. Section 7 concludes the findings of this study. 2 Methodology 2.1 Recurrent neural network (RNN) RNNs are a significant category of DL models and have been successfully applied for various sequential data tasks, including machine translation [51], sentiment classification [52], and time-sequence prediction [53], etc. The naïve RNN can only handle short sequential data, since the RNN units contain no memory of the initial inputs after several time steps and always suffer from gradient vanishing/exploding problems. In faced with these limitations, gated RNN models, including gated recurrent unit (GRU) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, are proposed to provide an effective solution to handle the long sequential data. 2.1.1 Long short-term memory network (LSTM) The architecture of the LSTM unit is demonstrated in Fig. 1 a. The following equations are used to calculate the LSTM state at each time step: (1) i → ( t ) = σ ( W → X I X → ( t ) + W → H I h → ( t − 1 ) + B → I ) (2) f → ( t ) = σ ( W → X F X → ( t ) + W → H F h → ( t − 1 ) + B → F ) (3) o → ( t ) = σ ( W → X O X → ( t ) + W → H O h → ( t − 1 ) + B → o ) (4) g → ( t ) = t a n h ( W → X G X → ( t ) + W → H G h → ( t − 1 ) + B → G ) (5) c → ( t ) = f → ( t ) ° c → ( t − 1 ) + i → ( t ) ° g ( t ) (6) h → ( t ) = o → ( t ) ° tanh ( c → ( t ) ) Where i → ( t ) , f → ( t ) , and o → ( t ) represent the input, forget and output gate, respectively. W → X I , W → X F , W → X O , W → X G W → H I , W → H F , W → H O , and W → H G are the weight matrices. The symbol \u201c ° \u201d is used to designate the Hadamard product. 2.1.2 Gated recurrent unit network (GRU) The architecture of the GRU unit is demonstrated in Fig. 1b. Different from LSTM, the GRU unit uses a single update gate z → ( t ) instead of the input and update gate (i.e., i → ( t ) and f → ( t ) ) in the LSTM unit. In addition, the GRU unit uses gate r → ( t ) named reset gate to determine whether the past hidden state is ignored. The following equations are used to calculate the GRU state at each time step: (7) z → ( t ) = σ ( W → X Z X → ( t ) + W → H Z h → ( t − 1 ) ) (8) r → ( t ) = σ ( W → X R X → ( t ) + W → h r h → ( t − 1 ) ) (9) g → ( t ) = T a n h ( W → X G X → ( t ) + W → H G h → ( t − 1 ) + W → H G ( r → ( t ) ° h → ( t − 1 ) ) ) (10) h → ( t ) = ( 1 − z → ( t ) ) ° h → ( t − 1 ) + z → ( t ) ° g → t Where X → ( t ) and h → ( t ) are the input and the hidden state at time t. z → ( t ) and r → ( t ) are the update gate and reset gate respectively. W → X Z , W → X R , W → X G W → H Z , W → H R , and W → H G are the weight matrices. 2.1.3 Encoder-decoder RNN The encoder-decoder RNN has recently been applied for machine translation [54], speech recognition [55] and sequence prediction [56], etc. The encoder-decoder RNN uses a sequence of historical data to construct multi-step ahead predictions. Fig. 1c shows a diagram of an encoder-decoder RNN. The encoder layer receives the input sequence X → with an input sequence length of m. The context vector generated by the encoder layer is then fed to the decoder layer to generate an output sequence Y → with output length of n. Both LSTM and GRU based RNN layers could be used in the encoder-decoder RNN model. 2.1.4 Evaluation metrics In this study, the DL models are developed using the Pytorch libraries within Python 3.7 environment using a CPU of Intel Core i7-8700U @ 3.20 GHz and 16G RAM. Three prediction accuracy metrics, i.e., the root mean squared error (RMSE), the mean absolute error (MAE) the coefficient of variation (CV), are used to reflect prediction accuracy. RMSE, MAPE, and CV are calculated using Eq. 11\u201313, respectively. (11) RMSE = ∑ i = 1 N ( y ˆ − y ) 2 N (12) MAPE = ∑ i = 1 N | y ˆ − y y | N × 100 (13) CV = ∑ i = 1 N ( y ˆ − y ) 2 N − 1 y × 100 where y and y ˆ are the actual and predicted values respectively. 2.2 DL-based MPC MPC is a control strategy that determines the optimal control actions over a finite time horizon by considering the control objective, system dynamics, and system constraints [57]. MPC has the following advantages that make it a promising strategy for building management. First, MPC is able to handle the tradeoff among multiple control objectives. Second, optimal control could be realized in predictive manna by taking into account the predicted future states of the system over the prediction horizon. Last but not the least, the MPC algorithm can be integrated into the existing local control loops as the supervisory control [58]. The schematic of the MPC algorithm is demonstrated in Fig. 2 a. Optimal control inputs ( u 1 , u 2 , \u2026 , u N ) over a prediction horizon N are calculated to reach the minimum value of the objective function (Fig. 2a). In a receding horizon implementation, only u 1 is applied on the actual system and the N-step optimization problem is resolved at each control step, which effectively eliminates the accumulation of control error. In this study, we propose a DL-based MPC framework by integrating the encoder-decoder RNN network into the MPC framework to construct the closed-loop control (Fig. 2b). To be specific, the encoder captures the features of the past observations by using the past control input u \u2032 → (i.e., HVAC temperature), past control output z \u2032 → (i.e., indoor temperature) and the environmental variables s \u2032 → (e.g., outdoor temperature and humidity) as the model input (Figs. 1b and 2b). Then the decoder section consisting of n RNN cells performs the prediction task to obtain the control output z → over the n prediction horizon. The objective function of MPC is calculated based on the output of the decoder cells ( z → ). Then the MPC optimization is conducted using a gradient-based algorithm and the required gradient information with respect to the control inputs is calculated using the standard back-propagation algorithm through time. 3 Co-simulation platform It is of great importance to evaluate the performance of advanced control strategies using a high-accurate dynamic simulation platform. Previous studies investigating building environment control based on BES-CFD co-simulation platforms are summarized in Table 2 . It is demonstrated that the coupled simulation is able to provide accurate indoor temperature analysis and would significantly benefit building climate control [46]. 3.1 Coupled simulation strategy In this study, a co-simulation platform is established by integrating Modelica and CFD model. To be specific, Modelica is used for HVAC simulation, while CFD provides a dynamic simulation platform for modeling the temperature distributions in buildings. In addition, the Python module is introduced to the simulation platform in order to model and control the system dynamics based on the DL-based MPC algorithm. Fig. 3 shows the framework of the Python-Modelica-CFD co-simulation platform. The DL-based MPC controller operates at a time interval of Δt MPC , and the CFD and Modelica simulator exchange data at a time interval of Δt (Δt«Δt MPC ). The calculated optimal supply air temperature T MPC is obtained based on the DL-based MPC algorithm by using the CFD-generated indoor temperature as control feedback. Then the HVAC simulator generates the actual supply air temperature T SA to track T MPC by regulating the actuators in HVAC systems. The indoor temperature is then generated by CFD simulations using the actual supply air temperature T SA as the inlet temperature. The schematic of the building HVAC system is demonstrated in Fig. 4 . As shown in Fig. 4, the HVAC system is simulated in a coupled simulation approach by considering the dynamic interaction between indoor airflow and HVAC systems. The co-simulation platform would be further used for evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed building control strategy. 3.2 Implementation of the co-simulation platform The co-simulation platform is established in Simulink. The DL-based MPC control program in Python, the HVAC simulator in Modelica, and the CFD program would be imported to Simulink respectively as an independent module. The Modelica program for HVAC simulation is exported as Functional Mock-up Unit (FMU), and the FMU would then be imported to Simulink for co-simulation based on the Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) standard. In addition, the S-function of MATLAB is used to achieve data exchange between Simulink and CFD model. And Python code could be directly called using the S-function in Matlab. Different from many of the previous studies, our co-simulation platform does not rely on the additional generated text file that records the real-time calculation results as the intermediary for data exchange between simulation tools. Our proposed simulation platform exchanges data directly through the Functional Mock-up Interface and/or Socket communication, and thus would significantly improve the calculation efficiency of the coupled simulation. 4 Implementations of DL-based MPC In this study, in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed DL-based MPC control strategy, two different case studies are conducted in the co-simulation platform. To be specific, Case 1 is conducted in a confined space under fixed conditions with the control objective to track time-varying indoor temperature setpoints, while Case 2 is conducted in an office room subjected to solar radiation under time-varying conditions with the control objectives for optimizing building energy efficiency and indoor thermal comfort simultaneously. 4.1 HVAC model In this study, the HVAC system (Fig. 4) is simulated using the HVAC model in the Modelica Buildings library, which was developed by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory [60]. Specifically, the HVAC system consists of a heat exchanger, fan, a chilled plant with a valve in the water loop, and multiple temperature sensors. The model of cooling coil is described as shown in Eq. (14). (14) C c o i l d T C o i l d t = T a i r − T C o i l R a i r − T C o i l − T w a t e r R w a t e r where C c o i l is the heat capacity of the cooling coil in [ kJ / °C ], R a i r and R w a t e r are the heat resistance in [ °C / kW ] at air and water sides, respectively. T C o i l is the average temperature in [ °C ] of the cooling coil. T a i r is the supply air temperature in [ °C ]. T w a t er is the water temperature in [ °C ] in the cooling coil. Moreover, to track the HVAC temperature setpoint (T MPC ), the chilled water flowrate is regulated by a two-way motorized valve through a PID controller. In addition, the PID controller is set to run at a much shorter control interval than that of the MPC controller (Δt PID «Δt MPC ) in order to track T MPC as fast as possible [25]. The model for the heat exchanger is shown in Eq. (15): (15) Q = εn Q m a x where Q m a x is the maximum heat in [kJ] that can be transferred and ε is the constant effectiveness of the heat exchanger. 4.2 Building model 4.2.1 Case 1: confined space with mixing ventilation The performance of the DL-based MPC is evaluated in a confined space with floor heating coupled with a mechanical ventilation system [61]. Detailed room configuration could be found in Ref. [61]. To be specific, the experiment is conducted in a 1.04 m × 1.04 m × 0.7 m (x × y × z) chamber with floor, wall, and roof temperature of 308.5 K, 288K, and 288 K respectively. In our study, the indoor temperature distribution is simulated using the RANS k-ε model and has been validated in [19] using the experimental data in Ref. [61]. 4.2.2 Case 2: an office subjected to solar radiation In this study, an office room similar to the room configuration in Refs. [62,63] is built for investigating the effectiveness of the DL-based MPC method (Fig. 5 ). Air is supplied from a 0.9 m × 0.2 m supply vent close to the ceiling, and is exhausted through a 0.4 m × 0.4 m vent in the ceiling. The exterior wall is set as time-varying heat-flux boundary condition to evaluate the effects of the solar radiation. The computer and occupant are set as the constant heat-flux boundary condition. We conduct CFD simulation by using the RANS k-ε model. In addition, to investigate the radiative effects on the indoor thermal environment, radiative heat transfer is modeled using the Surface-to-Surface (S2S) approach. The experimental data in Ref. [64] are employed in this study for model validation (Fig. 6 ). The experiment is conducted in a 4.2 m × 3.6 m × 2.75 m chamber containing a 0.4 m × 0.3 m × 0.3 m heat source (Fig. 6a). The supply air temperature is 289 K and the airflow rate is 41.6 m3/h. More details about the experimental setup can be found in Ref. [64]. We compare the experimental data with our CFD simulation results by incorporating RANS k-ε model and S2S model, and validate the effectiveness of our simulation model (Fig. 6b). As shown in Fig. 6b, the CFD simulation achieves acceptable agreement with the experimental data. 4.3 Control objectives 4.3.1 Case 1 The building thermal behavior is modeled using the encoder-decoder RNN model. The encoder-decoder RNN model uses the historical HVAC temperature ( T H V A C \u2032 → ) and historical indoor temperature ( T i n d o o r \u2032 → ) as the input variables for modeling the room air temperature T i n d o o r → at the point (x = 0.5, y = 0.9) over the prediction horizon. The objective of the MPC controller is to track the temperature setpoints without violating the constraints in Eq. 16\u201318: (16) m i n ∑ i = 1 N ( T i n d o o r − T s e t p o i n t ) 2 (17) s . t . ⋅ T l o w e r < T S A < T u p p e r (18) | T S A , t − T S A , t − 1 | < r l i m i t Where T u p p e r and T l o w e r are the upper and lower bound of supply air temperature respectively, T s e t p o i n t is the indoor temperature setpoint, and r l i m i t is the increasing rate of supply air temperature between two control steps. 4.3.2 Case 2 In this case, the DL-based model uses the historical HVAC temperature ( T H V A C \u2032 → ), historical indoor temperature ( T i n d o o r \u2032 → ) and historical environmental variables (i.e., solar radiation load ( g S o l a r \u2032 → )) as the input variables for modeling the room air temperature T i n d o o r → over the prediction horizon as shown in Eq. (19). (19) T i n d o o r → = f ( T i n d o o r \u2032 → , T H V A C \u2032 → , g S o l a r \u2032 → ) The objective of the DL-based MPC controller is to maintain indoor temperature within the comfort range while improving HVAC energy consumption as shown in equation (20): (20) min ∑ i = 1 N ω d ( min { T indoor − T up , 0 , T low − T indoor } ) 2 + ω e ( Q cooling 1000 ) 2 Where ω d is the weight coefficient penalizing discomfort and ω e is the weight coefficient for energy consumption. T up and T low are the upper and lower threshold of the comfort range in this study and the indoor temperature is set to be in the range of 24\u201325 °C. Q c o o l i n g refers to the cooling power. To implement energy consumption optimization in this study, the cooling power of the HVAC system is estimated according to Eq. (21) in Ref. [65], which has been widely applied in previous studies for optimizing HVAC energy consumption [66,67]. Specifically, the model of cooling power mainly consists of indoor sensible heat load and the cooling load for outdoor air treatment: (21) Q c o o l i n g = m ˙ a i r c p ( T i n d o o r − T S A ) + m ˙ f r e s h ( h o u t − h i n d o o r ) ˙ where m ˙ a i r and m ˙ f r e s h are the mass flow rate of supply air (kg/s) and fresh air (kg/s) respectively, c p is the specific air heat, T S A is the supply air temperature. h o u t and h i n d o o r are the specific enthalpy of the outdoor and indoor air respectively. In addition, to evaluate the effectiveness of the DL-based MPC, discomfort index I d is specifically defined as the sum of all the temperature violations [68] as shown in Eq.(22). (22) I d = ∫ 0 l min { | T i n d o o r ( t ) − T u p | , | T i n d o o r ( t ) − T l o w | } d t / l Where T up and T low are the upper and lower threshold of the comfort range respectively. l is the time period in [h] for evaluating discomfort index. 5 Results This study investigates the proposed DL-based MPC framework for real-time control of building thermal environment. This section focuses on investigating how to train this model efficiently in the DL-based MPC framework and demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy. 5.1 Case 1 5.1.1 Model prediction The input sequence length m (as shown in Fig. 1c) plays an important role in determining the prediction performance of the encoder-decoder RNN model. The input sequence length determines the number of previous states used for future prediction and is a critical parameter especially for systems with strong time-delay effects. Thus, in order to ensure efficient operation of the DL-based MPC controller, the input sequence length is used as the hyperparameter that requires to be tuned to ensure satisfied prediction accuracy. The effect of input sequence length on model accuracy is described in Fig. 7 . As shown in Fig. 7, both LSTM and GRU perform well in modeling the indoor temperature variations with RMSE value lower than 0.3 K. Previous studies also demonstrated that comparative performance between GRU and LSTM over a wide range of application tasks [69,70], since they shared the similar gated algorithm. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 7, a small input sequence length would result in inadequate description of the previous state, while a large input sequence length would result in a significant increase in the complexity of the DL model and decreases the prediction accuracy as a result. In this section, LSTM based encoder-decoder RNN model with an input length of 8 (m = 8) is chosen for further investigation of control performance due to its great prediction performance with RMSE below 0.18 and MAPE below 0.32%. 5.1.2 Control performance In this case, the performance DL-based MPC controller is evaluated in a confined space using coupled simulation approach, and the control objective in this case is to track the time-varying indoor temperature setpoints. The control performance of the DL-based MPC is presented in Fig. 8 . Since the PID controller runs at a much shorter sampling interval than the control interval of the MPC controller, the PID controller is able to track T MPC quickly in less than 30 s (Fig. 8a). Variations of indoor temperature from t = 0 s to t = 600 s are demonstrated in Fig. 8d. In addition, it could be observed that the indoor temperature reaches the indoor temperature setpoint in less than 600 s with the control accuracy lower than 0.1%, which demonstrates the good performance of the proposed controller. 5.2 Case 2 5.2.1 Model prediction The input sequence length is used as the hyperparameter that requires to be tuned to ensure model prediction accuracy and to further contribute to efficient operation of the DL-based MPC algorithm. The effect of input sequence length on the model accuracy is described in Fig. 9 . As shown in Fig. 9, the encoder-decoder RNN model with an input length of 6 performs best with the lowest RMSE, MAPE, and CV of 0.51 K,0.14%, and 0.20% respectively. Decreasing input sequence length from 6 to 3 would result in lower prediction accuracy due to inadequate description of the previous state for future prediction. On the other hand, increase the input sequence length from 6 to 12 would result in a significant increase in the complexity of the DL model and decreases the prediction accuracy as a result. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the LSTM-based model performs slightly better than the GRU-based model. In summary, the LSTM-based model with an input sequence length of 6 (m = 6) is chosen for the investigation of control performance. 5.2.2 Control performance In this case, the control objective of the DL-based MPC controller is to optimize the indoor thermal environment while saving building energy consumptions. The control performance of the DL-based MPC is demonstrated in Fig. 10 . The MPC controller operates at a 10-min time interval (ΔtMPC = 10 min). It is observed that approximately 30 min are taken for the MPC controller indoor temperature to reach the comfort thermal range within 297\u2013298 K (Fig. 10a and c). The weight coefficients for penalizing discomfort and energy consumption (i.e., ω d and ω e ) play an important role in determining MPC performance. Here, the weight coefficients ω d is fixed at 1 and different ω e values are investigated to demonstrate their effects on MPC performance. As shown in Fig. 10a, the DL-based MPC with ω e = 0.2 is able to keep the temperature within the comfort range perfectly, since thermal comfort is given higher priority than energy consumption. Increasing the value of weight coefficient ω e would contribute to higher supply air temperature for more energy saving, but also results in fluctuation of indoor temperature around the upper comfort bound. The DL-based MPC controller has to struggle to find a balance between indoor thermal comfort and energy savings (Fig. 10). Fig. 11 c and d quantitatively analyzes the effect of weight coefficients ω e on the DL-based MPC performance. For example, the average cooling power for ω e = 2 is 1359 W, which is 300 W lower than the cooling power for ω e = 0.2 . On the other hand, the discomfort index for MPC controller with ω e = 2 is 35% higher than that of an MPC controller with ω e = 0.2 , indicating that MPC controller with higher ω e value is at higher risk of violating the indoor thermal comfort bounds. Considering the trade-off between thermal comfort and energy consumption, it is necessary to analyze the importance of thermal comfort, the availability of energy, and the cost of electricity to determine the appropriate weight coefficients (i.e., ω d and ω e ) during the controller design process. 5.2.3 Comparison with PID control The performance of the DL-based MPC controller is compared with the traditional PID controller and the adaptive PID controller as shown in Fig. 11. It should be noted that it is difficult for the traditional PID controller to adapt to different building operational conditions based on the fixed control parameters, and the adaptive PID improves the traditional PID control performance by auto-tuning of the control parameters using the single neuron PID control algorithm. It is shown that compared with the traditional PID method, the adaptive PID has better performance in terms of convergence time and control accuracy (Fig. 11a and b). However, compared with the DL-based MPC, both traditional PID and adaptive PID control strategies cannot realize multi-objective control and they violate the indoor thermal comfort bounds at a much higher frequency. The discomfort index of traditional PID and adaptive PID is almost 2.6 and 0.9 times higher than that of the DL-based MPC ( ω e = 2 ) respectively. In addition, approximately 4% and 7% energy savings are achieved on average through DL-based MPC compared with the adaptive PID control and traditional PID control respectively. Moreover, the DL-based MPC also has the potential to outperform physics-based MPC. Compared with the DL-based MPC, the physics-based MPC suffers from the following two major limitations: 1) difficulty in obtaining accurate physical parameters (e.g. infiltration rate and heat transfer coefficient) for construction of precise physical model due to measurement limitations, 2) requirement of domain knowledge to establish a high-accuracy model. Compared with the physics-based MPC, the proposed DL-based MPC in our study could be realized through fully automated processes, and efforts for constructing MPC controller could be significantly reduced through DL-based MPC. 6 Discussions 6.1 Advantages of the proposed DL-based MPC With the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT) in buildings, massive measurements reflecting building operation conditions could be obtained based on the sensors in buildings, which provides opportunities to develop DL-based models for building automation and control [71]. The encoder-decoder RNN mainly has the following two advantages: (1) The encoder-decoder RNN takes advantage of the prediction capacity of LSTM and/or GRU network and is able to learn the complex systems with high prediction accuracy. (2) The encoder-decoder RNN handles long-term prediction well based on the multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) strategy, which would benefit the DL-based MPC control with a long prediction horizon. In addition, another significant advantage of the proposed DL-based MPC controller is that it could be realized through fully automated processes without reliance on domain knowledge to establish a building model. According previous studies, about six months were required to construct a physics-based building model for accurate operation of the physics-based MPC [72]. Compared with the physics-based MPC, it takes much less time to establish a building model for DL-based MPC. Our study demonstrates that about 77 s and 46 s are required to train the DL-based building model for further implementation of the DL-based MPC in Case 1 and Case 2, respectively. Based on the results of this study, it could be inferred that the DL-based MPC has significant application potential for building automation and control in real applications. 6.2 Limitations of this study The calculation efficiency of the co-simulation platform is limited because of the time-consuming CFD simulations. Future study could introduce FFD simulation [73] to the co-simulation platform to accelerate the simulation speed. Moreover, building simulations considering multiple time-varying environmental variables (e.g., indoor and outdoor humidity) should be conducted in the future study in order to shed light on the DL-based MPC performance in complex applications. In addition, the DL-based MPC systems are applied for single-zone testbeds in this study. In the future study, the DL-based MPC is required to be applied to buildings with multi-zones to further explore the application potential of the control strategy. 7 Conclusions In this study, a DL-based MPC framework using the encoder-decoder RNN is developed for real-time control of building thermal environment to take the advantage of both DL and MPC algorithms. In addition, this study develops a co-simulation platform by integrating the HVAC simulator and the CFD model, which provides an effective and accurate solution for evaluating the proposed building control strategies. Based on the simulation results, the following conclusions can be drawn: 1) The input sequence length of the encoder-decoder RNN is a critical parameter in the DL-based MPC framework, especially for the system with strong nonlinear features and time-delay effects. Small input sequence length would result in inadequate description of the previous states of the building system, while large input length would increase the complexity of the model. According to the results of our study, an input sequence length of 6 (m = 6) with the prediction accuracy of 0.51 K,0.14%, and 0.20% for RMSE, MAPE and CV respectively is appropriate for controlling the office room based on the proposed MPC algorithm. 2) Considering the trade-off between thermal comfort and energy consumption, it is necessary to analyze the importance of thermal comfort, the availability of energy, and the cost of electricity to determine the appropriate weight coefficients (i.e., ω d and ω e ) during the controller design process. 3) Approximately 4% and 7% energy savings are achieved on average through DL-based MPC compared with the traditional PID control and adaptive PID control respectively. Moreover, the proposed DL-based MPC strategy could be applied for more complex building systems with more energy savings by fully exploiting the advantages of deep learning.

        "dc:description": "The development of deep learning (DL) technology provides an opportunity for accurate prediction and effective control of complex building systems. However, despite the high prediction performance of DL models, few studies integrate DL with the model predictive control (MPC) algorithm for improving building management. In this study, a DL-based MPC framework using encoder-decoder recurrent neural network is developed for real-time control of building thermal environment to exploit the advantage of both DL and MPC algorithms. In addition, to simulate the dynamic interaction between indoor airflow and HVAC systems, a co-simulation platform by integrating HVAC simulator and CFD model is developed to evaluate the proposed building control strategy. Two case studies including a confined space with mixing ventilation and an office room subjected to solar radiation are used for validation of the proposed method. The performance of the DL-based MPC algorithm for building thermal environment control is compared with the traditional proportion-integration-differentiation (PID) controller and the adaptive PID controller. Approximately 4% and 7% energy savings are achieved on average through DL-based MPC compared with adaptive and conventional PID control, respectively. The proposed DL-based MPC framework shows a promising application prospect for building automationby taking the advantage of both deep learning and MPC algorithms.",
