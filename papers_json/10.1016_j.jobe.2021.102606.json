However, the thermal comfort of occupants at lower energy consumption is a significant challenge to researchers. Therefore, in this study, a new smart approach is presented, which has the ability to take into account the impact of the next wall neighbors, and the outside temperature to reduce the energy consumption of an HVAC system without affecting the thermal comfort of occupants. Our model is based on four strategies implemented and simulated using the 3D modeling interface of the Rhino/Grasshopper visual programming tool. The control system of our office building intends to meet the ANSI/ASHRAE standard, which defines the thermal comfort of occupants. The proposed system takes into account the effect of different heat loads of a building, such as equipment load, lighting density, and the number of people per area. Our machine-to-machine communication based approach is capable of reducing energy consumption while keeping the occupants thermally comfortable. Consequently, the annual energy consumption has been reduced by an average of 16% at different setpoints of the HVAC system. Keywords IoT Fuzzy logic Energy management system M2M Smart air conditioning Smart building 1 Introduction Nowadays, the significant amount of energy consumption in the world originates from office buildings (i.e., 100 to 1000 KWh/m2 per year in Europe) [1]. This overconsumption is mostly due to the intense use of air-conditioners. One of the significant alerts demonstrates that the earth temperature has increased between 1.0° and 3.7° in the twenty-first century [2]. According to \u201cInternational Energy consumption Outlook,\u201d [3] the European countries consume more than 100 KWh/m2 per year for HVAC and lighting systems [4]. Saving energy has become a priority for many countries as the buildings comprise 20% of the worldwide total energy consumption. Verbong [5] shows the initiative of the European countries that focuses on saving energy by applying particular solutions and aims to save 80% of energy by 2050 [6]. Besides, the other additional policy measures were adopted by all the European countries to achieve challenging goals of saving energy. For example, a planning process is required during the design of buildings by simulating the energy efficiency level of the buildings, as shown by Fabi et al. [7]. On the other hand, saving energy of buildings impacts the thermal comfort of the occupant, therefore, the productivity of the occupants in office buildings [8]. Boyce et al. [9] and Rashid et al. [10] demonstrate that saving energy by applying some efficient solutions degrades the comfort level of occupants and limits access to the control system of the office building. Energy efficiency has a negative cumulative effect that could suppress employees dealing with challenging tasks [11], in that, achieving a balance between an efficient energy consumption and a minimum comfort level for workers is hard to accomplish. The many studies on energy management problems focus on energy efficiency and thermal comfort. Anand et al. [12] prove that adjusting the ventilation level according to the actual number of occupancy will save energy in the building. Hacene et al. [13] focus on how to reduce the energy consumption in standard houses of four occupants by adding some insulation and minor change to the architecture of the house. Li et al. [14] provide an efficient method for finding the circulation of the total space heating energy consumption for the heating season. Ayoub [15] presents a new methodology to estimate the performance of the building by acquiring the data of the total daylight and energy consumption of the occupied floor. Ng B\u2013H et al. [16] present different types of buildings intended to save energy in Malaysia without considering neither the thermal comfort of users nor the lighting conditions of the buildings. Konis [17] introduced a study that achieved a remarkable rate of energy-saving (i.e.,19.6% for lighting and 40.8% for cooling) by implementing building services such as blinds, lighting, and air-conditioning system, while keeping the occupants thermally comfortable. Zeiler et al. [18] provide an evaluation of the user behavior in the building via an infrared (IR) sensor above the office desk to measure the temperature of the users. As a result, they succeeded in saving more than 20% and 40% for heating and cooling modes, respectively, without any complaints of thermal comfort by users. Valančius et al. [19] demonstrated a simple methodology for reducing energy consumption in real office buildings through natural ventilation. The authors also confirmed that by applying a range of optimal temperatures (i.e, 21.6 °C to 18 °C), the energy cost was decreased with no effect on the performance level. Ari et al. [20] used a gradient-based optimization to save energy consumption and apply fuzzy rules obtained by the solutions to the gradient optimization to be involved in a fuzzy logic control system. The results of their study show no negative impact on users based on the ANSI/ASHRAE standard-55 for thermal comfort of human occupancy. The ANSI/ASHRAE standard-55 defines the thermal comfort requirements for a large group of people in term of air temperature, humidity, mean radiant temperature, air velocity, activity level, and insulation value of clothing. The simulation results showed that the architecture developed at the project can provide approximately 28% energy savings. However, some of these works are relatively complicated to use and may compromise the comfort and productivity of the occupants. Contrary to the solutions mentioned above, our proposed architecture includes four simple strategies to control an HVAC system by considering the parameters such as equipment load, lighting density, and the number of people per area. It employs a fuzzy logic controller with a self-control capability using Machine to machine (M2M) communication. It can also automatically switch the HVAC system between ON/OFF based on the ANSI/ASHRAE thermal comfort standard-55 [21]. The main contributions of this research can be summarized as follows: \u2022 The proposed system can reduce the energy consumption ratio in office buildings while keeping the surrounding thermal environment in comfortable level for the occupants. \u2022 The proposed building energy management methodology takes into account the impact of the next wall neighbors and the outside temperature. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: the building model section presents the utilized 3D building model for analyzing, energy simulation, and validation. The implementation details are given in the section of Implementation of the proposed system design. The simulation results and discussions section include the performance results with the related discussions and sensitivity analysis. The last section provides the conclusion of the study along with the final remarks. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Building simulation model The building model is a typical 3D design of an office building, which we simulated with the seasonal weather and the internal load in terms of occupancy. The architecture design is based on many studies such as building model with the layout, thermal resistance, energy per zone load (i.e., Equipment, Infiltration, Lighting, the number of people, and ventilation), and the sun\u2019s effect on the building design. The studies such as the ones by Schiefelbein et al. [22], Alhuwayil et al. [23], Sanaieian et al. [24] and Mirrahimi et al. [25] have demonstrated that all these parameters of the building model could impact the amount of energy demand and thermal comfort. The characteristics of the model design are presented in the following section. 2.1.1 Building architecture In order to simulate and estimate the hourly energy consumption of a typical building, two different types of office buildings were proposed (i.e., Simple and Large scale). The first one is composed of an open workspace, as depicted in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 , and the second one consists of a large office building divided into nine open work spaces (i.e., 3 × 3), as shown in Fig. 3 . The latter is used to understand the effect of the sun in the different parts of the building, especially on the corners, perimeter, and interior of the open workspaces. We made assumptions about the thermal preferences of individuals, energy per zone load and the building structure. The results were obtained assuming complete knowledge of individual preferences and the surrounding thermal environment, and under the assumptions that the building has identical exterior wall resistance values in each zone of the building (corner, perimeter, interior) and identical interior wall resistance values. The building model considers the following: \u2022 Constructions type of the surfaces, boundary conditions of all the surfaces (such as Ground, and material type of the exterior and interior walls), \u2022 Occupancy schedules, \u2022 Activity schedule: The metabolic rate of the occupants, \u2022 Heating/Cooling setpoint schedules: depending on the season, \u2022 Lighting schedules, \u2022 Equipment schedules, \u2022 Infiltration schedules, \u2022 Ventilation schedules, and \u2022 Loads for internal appliances. 2.1.2 Layout The layout of the simulation model will include only a one-floor office building, as depicted in Fig. 3. In the layout, each OS_i (Open Space) is given in Figs. 1 and 2. The dimensions of the exterior wall, exterior window, and ceiling/floor are listed in Table 1 . 2.1.3 Thermal resistance The values of thermal resistance coefficients used in the building model are listed in Table 2 . The thermal resistance with a high value means good insulation. 2.1.4 Energy per zone load The energy per zone load takes into account some parameters such as equipment load, infiltration rate, lighting density, the number of people, and ventilation per area/person; based on the recommendation settings of the modeling interface tool [26]. These settings are defined as follows: \u2022 Input parameters: - Equipment load per area of the conditional space (i.e., 16.79 W/m2): The desired equipment load per square meter of the floor (Typical values can range from 2 W/m2 [for just a laptop or two in the zone] to 16.79 W/m2 [for an office filled with computers and appliances]). - Infiltration rate per area (i.e., 0.0003 m3/s per m2): The desired rate of the outside air infiltration into the zone per square meter of the floor. ASHRAE recommends the following general infiltration rates based on the area of the facade exposed to the outdoors: \u2022 0.0001 (m3/s per m2 facade) - Tight building \u2022 0.0003 (m3/s per m2 facade) - Average building \u2022 0.0006 (m3/s per m2 facade) - Leaky building - Lighting density per area (i.e., 11.84 W/m2): The desired lighting load per square meter of the floor. The typical values range from 3 W/m2 to 15 W/m2 for efficient LED bulbs and incandescent heat lamps, respectively. - The number of people per area (i.e.,0.5 people/m2): The desired number of people per square meter of the floor at peak occupancy. The typical values range from 0.02 people/m2 to 0.5 people/m2 for a lightly occupied open office and a tightly one, respectively. - Ventilation per area (i.e., 0.0003 m3/s per m2 of the floor): The desired minimum rate of the outdoor air ventilation through the mechanical system into the zone. The typical values range from 0.0002 m3/s per m2 to 0.0025 m3/s per m2 for spaces like laboratories and cleanrooms where dust contamination is a major concern. - Ventilation per person (i.e., 0.0023 m3/s per person): The desired minimum rate of outdoor air ventilation through the mechanical system into the zone per person in the zone. In effect, an input here will mimic demand-controlled ventilation, where the ventilation through the mechanical system will change depending upon the occupancy. 2.1.5 The path of the sun The designer of the building model can save energy and increase comfort by taking advantage of passive solar design. The sun path is beneficial in order to generate the sun vectors that can be used for sunlight hour\u2019s analysis or shading design, as depicted in Fig. 4 . 2.2 The proposed system design The proposed study illustrated in Fig. 5 is composed of the four different parts: a 3D office building model with a thermal circuit network including all the properties of the materials used in the building; management system satisfying the thermal comfort requirements of users and saving energy; the energy simulation and comfort study. Both the energy and comfort simulations are based on the ASHRAE Standard55, which is widely accepted by the European and American laboratories [21,27]. 2.2.1 3D building design The design of the office building takes into account the following parameters: - Type of material - Resistance value (m2K/W) - Thermal absorbance - The absorbance of solar radiation - The absorbance of visible light - Geometry of Building - The number of layers (such as Wall, Roof, and Floor). - Type of the building (Office) - Type of the zone in the building (such as Break Room, Storage, Vending, Open office) 2.2.2 Management system The office building is controlled by the different strategies as follows: - Enabling/Disabling HVAC system - Fuzzy logic: It has three inputs; internal ambient temperature of the neighborhood offices [Temp_N], the internal ambient temperature of the open space [Temp_OS_i], and the external ambient temperature [Temp_out]. Each input is composed of three fuzzy subsets (Cold, Mild, and Warm) and an output (The new setpoint temperature of the HVAC [New_Temp_OS_i]) is composed of four fuzzy subsets (Cold, Little cold, Neutral, Little warm, and Warm). - Machine to machine (M2M): The machine to machine strategy tries to be exchange the internal ambient temperature of each open workspace. It sets the corresponding setpoint of the HVAC of each open workspace office based on a specific algorithm. The management system relies on the occupancy and the HVAC settings by taking into account: - Zone loads per zone (Infiltration Rate, Number of people per area, Equipment load per area, lighting density per area) - Schedule program (Occupancy, Heating setpoint, Cooling setpoint, lighting, equipment) for one year 2.2.3 Energy simulation Based on the energyPlus weather data file (EPW) of the city of (Istanbul, Antalya and Kars), the energy simulation software (EnergyPlus [28]) is used to calculate energy consumption, including heating, cooling, and equipment energy use, and calculate the relative humidity and mean radian temperature. 2.2.4 Comfort study (ASHRAE-55) The comfort study takes the results of the energy simulation software to determine the percentage of the total comfort based on mean radian temperature, fan speed, metabolic rate, and clothing level of the occupant. 2.3 Control strategies 2.3.1 Enabling/disabling HVAC based on comfortable zone (ASHRAE-55) The method is based on a sample method to control the HVAC system by looking at the psychrometric chart. Based on that chart, we could evaluate a set of temperatures and humidity ratios from EPW weather data, indoor (temperature and humidity) ratios from an energy simulation, or individual numerical inputs of temperature and humidity. The data outputs of the management system (internal ambient temperature and humidity ratio) are plotted alongside polygons on a chart; the output data and polygons represent the comfort and the effects of passive building strategies on comfort, respectively. The specific human energy balance model used by the psychrometric chart is the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) model developed by P.O. Fanger. PMV is a seven-point scale from cold (−3) to hot (+3) that is used in comfort surveys [29]. Each integer value of the scale indicates the following: −3: Cold. −2: Cool. −1: Slightly Cool. 0: Neutral. +1: Slightly Warm. +2: Warm. +3: Hot. The range of comfort is generally accepted as a PMV value between −1 and +1, and this range defines the thermally comfortable points on the psychrometric chart. Accordingly, the simulation will result in the PMV of the occupant to estimate the thermal satisfaction of a population under any indoor environmental conditions. Based on the comfortable zone defined by P.O. Fanger ASHRAE-55 standard In Ref. [30], we can activate (Cooling/Heating mode depending on the season of the year) or deactivate (Drying mode) the HVAC system as depicted by the red zone in Fig. 6 . 2.3.2 Machine to machine (M2M) The essential role of M2M is to establish bidirectional communication with the device via a communication network. M2M standard converges various vertical services onto a common platform. It defines the interfaces required to support end-to-end services. M2M device can connect to a network using the following three methods: (i) Direct connectivity-using access network \u201cauthentication.\u201d (ii) Gateway-using an M2M gateway, and (iii) Multiple Gateway-using multiple M2M gateways. As an example, M2M was proposed as a solution in our earlier publication [31]. The prototype developed through that study was applied to a realistic scenario with two air conditioners. The strategy in the prototype uses M2M communication over the ZigBee module to handle the data transfer function. It supports a wide communication range with lower power consumption and is capable of providing both Point-to-Point and Point-to-Multi-Point connections. The strategy depending on M2M communication exchanges the temperature of all the office neighbors (OS_i) as depicted in Fig. 7 . Based on the position of the (OS_i), three main types of groups are determined: Group 1: Neighboring OS_i connections for corner. Group 2: Neighboring OS_i connections for perimeter. Group 3: Neighboring OS_i connections for interior. Based on this classification, the HVAC mode (Cooling/Heating) of the air conditioner will be set using the predefined setpoint of the user for each HVAC mode as illustrated in Fig. 8 . For the corner and perimeter offices, Selection decisions of the operating mode (Cooling, drying or Heating) will be based on these information: mean temperature of the outside and mean temperature of neighbors. The third group neighboring connections for the interior are OS_1, OS_5, OS_7, and OS_3. For this group the decisions will be based on only the mean temperature of the neighbors due to the absence of direct temperature impact with the external side. 2.3.3 Fuzzy logic The fuzzy logic depicted in Fig. 9 and Fig. 10 presents all the memberships in fuzzy sets. Cold, mild, and warm are considered the membership functions of inputs, and cold, little cold, neutral, little neutral, and warm are considered the ones of outputs (See Table 3 ). The fuzzy sets and operators are utilized by the following fuzzy if-then rules: The final output (New_temp_OS_i) is obtained by a fuzzy logic system after the inference process and defuzzification method with centroid defuzzification (computes the weighted average of a fuzzy set). If we apply this method to the fuzzy output \u201cZ is A\u201d, the crisp version of the final output (z) is obtained by Equation (1). (1) z = ∑ i = 0 n μ A ( z i ) · z i ∑ i = 0 n μ A ( z i ) Where zi is an element of the vector of fuzzy output Z. 2.3.4 Fuzzy logic with M2M Fuzzy Logic with M2M strategy The strategy based on M2M communication in order to exchange the temperature of all of the office neighbors (OS_i) and determine the proper mode of the HVAC. Fuzzy logic algorithm interact only if the mode decision is cooling or heating mode depending on the season of the year and gives the proper setpoint of the HVAC system as illustrated in the sequence diagram Fig. 11 . 3 Simulation results and discussions The simulation result of the office building has been obtained by using the 3D modeling interface of Rhino/Grasshopper [26] visual programming tool. It provides some simple plugins and tools in order to optimize the design of the building to get the best results concerning energy consumption and occupants\u2019 thermal comfort. The operative plug-ins of the tools include LadyBug and HoneyBee. LadyBug allows us to use certified energy and daylighting engines such as Daysim, Radiance, and EnergyPlus, whereas HoneyBee takes the standard EnergyPlus Weather files (EPW) for any cities in the world like ISTANBUL, ANTALYA and KARS [32]. 3.1 Simulation results 3.1.1 Simple scale In order to evaluate the impact of different climates on an open workspace (1 × 1) in the office building, we focused on three cities in the different regions of Turkey (ISTANBUL [located in the northwest], ANTALYA [located in the Mediterranean] and KARS [located in the northeast region]). In the simulation, we applied different setpoint values (State \u201cS1\u201d to state \u201cS7\u201d) for summer (Set cooling mode) and winter seasons (Set heating mode) to the HVAC with the two scenarios given below: The management system on standby mode and the ON/OFF management system based on the comfortable zone ASHRAE-55. Fig. 12 presents the impact of the outdoor temperature (Mean outdoor temperature for each month) on energy consumption. Table 4 , Table 5 , and Table 6 show the energy consumption in MWh, the level of the comfortable zone in percentage, and the resulting save or loss in percentage by assuming the outside temperature change for all seasons, respectively. Fig. 13 and Fig. 14 show the case studies for the three cities having different climate characteristics. The maximum total energy consumption and comfort gain are obtained by S1 (setpoint of HVAC = Cooling: 20, Heating: 19). The output data of the energy management system (internal ambient temperature and humidity) are plotted in the psychrometric chart (Fig. 15 ) in order to determine the number of point inside of polygons (define the boundary of comfort zone in term of minimum and maximum of internal temperature and humidity respectively). The results for the city of Istanbul presents the maximum comfort gain compared to the other cities, whereas the ones for Antalya does for energy save; except for S4 state case. On the other hand, the psychrometric charts, for example, are taken for each city to plot a set of temperatures and humidity ratios in terms of indoor comfort for state S1 the (S1) as illustrated in Figs. 15 and 16 , and Fig. 17 . These results demonstrate the impact of our strategy (With enabling/disabling HVAC) on the office building, especially for the city of ISTANBUL where most of the points (81.5%, Fig. 15) are inside of the two comfort polygons with highest comfort gain equal to 2.64%. However, most of the comfort points of ANTALYA and KARS presents 70.66% (Fig. 16, with comfort gain equal to 1.49%) and 99.09%, (Fig. 17, with comfort gain equal to 0.46%), respectively. The range of comfort is generally accepted as a Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) model between −1 and +1, and this is what defines the range of the comfort polygon on the psychrometric chart. The enabling/disabling HVAC system strategy has given encouraging results, especially in terms of energy save. In the next section, the proposed methods are implemented to a large design (3 × 3) for the city of Istanbul. 3.1.2 Large scale 3.1.2.1 Saving energy by enabling and disabling HVAC system In the case of large buildings (the ambient temperature of nine open workspaces), the temperature at each office in the proposed building model is affected by the temperature supplied by HVAC to the room, as well as the temperature of its adjoining wall neighbors. Table 7 summarizes the results in terms of energy saving and comfort gain for one year. The setpoint temperatures of the HVAC are set to different state values (S1 to S7) for the nine open workspaces (OS_0 to OS_8). Fig. 18 and Fig. 19 show the comfort and energy saving in percentage. The maximum annual energy saving is obtained by S1 (setpoint of HVAC \u201cCooling:20, Heating:19\u201d), and the maximum annual comfort gain is obtained by S5 (setpoint of HVAC \u201cCooling:24, Heating:15\u201d), compared to all open workspaces. 3.1.2.2 M2M based method for office number four (OS_4) This method is applied to the utilized building model (Large design). Table 8 lists the impact of the M2M based method on OS_4, in terms of energy saving and comfort gain for one year. The setpoint temperatures of the HVAC are set to different state values (S1 to S7) for the nine open workspaces (OS_0 to OS_8). The obtained results reveal clearly that S1 setpoint case exhibits significant save in terms of energy with acceptable comfort gain. However, there is a minor impact on the comfort of the user (state case S2 and S3). 3.1.2.3 Fuzzy logic study for office number four (OS_4) The Fuzzy logic strategy is applied to the proposed building model, as discussed in the implementation section. Three inputs (Temp_Out (Outside temperature), Temp_OS_i (Intern temperature), and Temp_N (Mean temperature of all neighbor \u201cOS_4 has four neighbors\u201d)), are taken into account in order to calculate the new setpoint temperature that should be applied to the fourth open workspace (OS_4) HVAC system. Table 9 lists the impact of the fuzzy logic algorithm strategy on the fourth open workspace, OS_4, concerning energy saving and comfort gain for one year. The setpoint temperatures of the HVAC are set to different state values (S1 to S7) for the nine open workspaces (OS_0 to OS_8). The obtained results demonstrate clearly that we have huge consumption with some save with respect to comfort (S1, S6 and S7), as depicted in Table 9. To be able to enhance the result obtained by this strategy, we combined the M2M with the fuzzy logic algorithm. 3.1.2.4 Fuzzy logic with M2M study for office number four (OS_4) The obtained results show clearly that although we combined strategies (the fuzzy logic and the strategy including M2M), we couldn\u2019t save energy of the user; as depicted in Table 10 . 3.2 Discussions The most significant challenge in buildings is to satisfy the occupant\u2019s comfort level requirements without colossal energy consumption. The latter becomes more challenging and requires greater efficiency when buildings are large and have a complex design. Hence, we proposed some methodologies and strategies that can introduce some improvements to the office buildings. The computed performances of all strategies were compared with each other with a different set point of HVAC system (S1 to S7) for office number four (OS_4). The results for the annual energy consumptions and the occupants' thermal comfort of all strategies are depicted in Table 11 and Table 12 . 3.2.1 Comparison of all studies or methodologies Fig. 20 presents the impact of the outdoor temperature on energy consumption for all proposed strategies. On the other hand, Fig. 21 summarizes our results in terms of gain, and the impact of the outdoor temperature on the hourly energy consumption, neither Fuzzy Logic nor M2M with fuzzy logic strategy could be the solution even with significant potential comfort gain (i.e., around 17% for state S7) due to the considerable consumption especially for the test case S6 (i.e., Setpoint \u201cHeating: 25, Cooling: 14\u201d) and S7 (i.e., Setpoint \u201cHeating: 26, Cooling: 13\u201d). Despite this, M2M and Enabling/Disabling HVAC system strategies should be optimum and the preferred solution to the energy management system by reducing energy consumption saving level (i.e., around an average of 16% and 14% for M2M and Enabling/Disabling HVAC, respectively) through specific improvement on occupant\u2019s comfort. 4 Sensitivity analysis As a results of the last analysis, M2M and Enabling/Disabling HVAC system strategies shows an optimum solution to the energy management system. Those analysis were done under certain condition (uniform heat effects and uniform occupancy) to see whether the proposed strategies in this research were workable or not. In order to get a realistic scenario the performance of M2M and Enabling/Disabling HVAC system strategies in terms of non-uniform heat effects and non-uniform occupancy effects are interpreted to provide a solution to a complex optimization problem. 4.1 Non-uniform heat load effects In all the simulation processes mentioned above, we assumed that the internal heat loads are identical in every office. However, heat loads will not be identical in real-world applications. Internal heat gain varies from one office to another in a building mainly due to the different amounts of heat generation from the appliances. In order to investigate the effects on the performance of M2M and Enabling/Disabling HVAC system, these simulations have been done using ten random sets of heat load for 3x3-room in a complex building type. The sets of heat loads were generated by a random distribution between 500 Watts and 1500 Watts (Table 13 , Fig. 22 , and Fig. 23 ). The lower heat load causes an increase in energy usage and comfort level of all strategies (i.e, With Enabling/Disabling and M2M) due to the low temperature in the corresponding open office. In order to see the effects of internal heat load on the energy consumption and the total comfort of all strategies, these approaches were executed for our proposed office building model (i.e., 3x3-open office building), and with the predefined heat load for each open office. Fig. 24 shows the average results of energy consumption and comfort gain for all open office buildings when the internal heat value changes. 4.2 Non-uniform occupancy effects The Internal temperature depends on the number of people in the building. As a default, the occupancies are identical in each open office (i.e., People = 5). However, in order to investigate the effect of a random number of people on the performance of Enabling/Disabling HVAC system and the strategy including M2M, ten different sets of the number of people per (pp) area (m2) are fixed. The sets of occupancy were generated by a random distribution between 0.2 pp/m2 to 0.5 pp/m2 people (Table 14 , Fig. 25 , and Fig. 26 ). These approaches were executed for the same office building model, and with the predefined occupancy for each open office. Fig. 27 shows the average results of energy consumption and comfort gain for all open office building when the occupancy value changes. 5 Conclusion and perspective In this work, an intelligent energy management model which includes different control strategies to reduce the energy consumption of an HVAC system without affecting the thermal comfort of occupants is proposed. Performance of control strategies has been evaluated comparatively in terms of thermal performance (i.e., user satisfaction) and energy consumption for an office building under reasonable assumptions to determine optimum strategy. The analysis has been performed based on the energyPlus weather data file. The comparative results demonstrate that M2M and Enabling/Disabling HVAC system strategies meet the challenge by reducing energy consumption (i.e., an average of around 16% and 14% for M2M and Enabling/Disabling HVAC, respectively) while improving or causing a trivial impact on users comfort (i.e., an average gain of −2,12% and 1.60% for M2M and Enabling/Disabling HVAC, respectively). On the other hand, the Fuzzy Logic algorithm gives priority to occupant comfort instead of energy saving. Moreover, this study reveals that the large size of office buildings brought about more complexity and a more significant challenge to save energy without causing dissatisfaction to the occupant. The proposed system design has also been analyzed with an endurance test considering non-uniform heat effects and non-uniform occupancy effect. The effectiveness of the proposed control strategies (M2M and Enabling/Disabling HVAC) has been validated according to the simulation results. Our ongoing work on optimal strategy and solution continues to investigate other artificial intelligence algorithms rather than fuzzy logic. Future approaches will validate whether there are any other sophisticated solutions to our open work office space building.

        "dc:description": "Building Energy Management Systems provide users with desired environmental conditions by organizing air-conditioning and lighting systems. Many studies related to the energy management system in smart buildings have been conducted. However, the thermal comfort of occupants at lower energy consumption is a significant challenge to researchers. Therefore, in this study, a new smart approach is presented, which has the ability to take into account the impact of the next wall neighbors, and the outside temperature to reduce the energy consumption of an HVAC system without affecting the thermal comfort of occupants. Our model is based on four strategies implemented and simulated using the 3D modeling interface of the Rhino/Grasshopper visual programming tool. The control system of our office building intends to meet the ANSI/ASHRAE standard, which defines the thermal comfort of occupants. The proposed system takes into account the effect of different heat loads of a building, such as equipment load, lighting density, and the number of people per area. Our machine-to-machine communication based approach is capable of reducing energy consumption while keeping the occupants thermally comfortable. Consequently, the annual energy consumption has been reduced by an average of 16% at different setpoints of the HVAC system.",
