The bang-bang relays of the multiple-boiler system (MBS) control, are characterized by complex limiter saturation functions and classified as fixed parameters. Their action signals cannot precisely control the nonlinear dynamic building heating demand over their entire range of operation. Moreover, in a mono-boiler system, the bang-bang controller endures increasing short cycling over partial load time due to the heating system being considered to have an oversized boiler at most times of running, thus promoting high energy consumption and fluctuating indoor thermal comfort. So, it is difficult to cope with uncertainties in outdoor environments and indoor heating load. Hence, this study formulates the MBS control problem as a dynamic Markov decision process and applies a deep clustering of reinforcement learning approach to obtain the optimal control policy through interaction with the environment based on multi-agent learning according to bang-bang action. With such an approach, adopting a new boiler sequencing control (BSC) strategy using deep clustering of reinforcement learning based on a bang-bang (DCRLBB) manner. The deep clustering is configured to break Lagrangian trajectory curves into piecewise segments to represent the RL agent's action policy. The agent's action policy signals are configured from the bang-bang reward formula based on trade-off implications to be more adjustable than traditional fixed parameters such as fuzzy bang-bang controller (FBBC). The agent of BSC significantly affects the energy performance of the MBS, whereas the other agent resizes boiler capacity by acting to adjust the boiler solenoid fuel valve. The comparison of results between the proposed strategy and conventional FBBC shows distinct differences in the superior response of DCRLBB under dynamic indoor/outdoor actual conditions and energy saving by more than 32% while maintaining the indoor thermal in the comfortable range.

The boiler heating loads are the most important factor in HVAC systems affected by direct emissions from burning fuels, which is significantly affected by the energy performance of the multiple-boiler system (MBS) [3]. Fuels demand response (DR) in boilers, along with greenhouse gas emissions, is considered a vital flexibility enabler in reducing consuming energy and carbon emission to increase the performance of controller action and the flexibility of the HVAC system [4,5]. Many studies present the potential for energy saving in boiler plants and achieved through improving heating system controls [6]. The most concern in building heating systems is that often-used boilers are much oversized to provide a substantial margin of heating load capacity, leading to inefficient management by conventional boiler controllers [7\u201312]. In control engineering, a single-input and single-output (SISO) type is still widely used to control boiler plants and HVAC systems automation [13,14]. The most common type of such algorithm is the proportional-integral-derivative (PID), which is found in more than 90% of industrial control applications using feedback control loops of PID [15]. The simplicity of PID attracted most scientists to be used in automatic control, and this feature helps be a popular control. Therefore, the PID is considered imperative to be used at the lowest control level in the pyramid hierarchy of boilers and HVAC control systems [16,17]. The PID fails with processes running too-high nonlinear systems and MIMO (multiple inputs, multiple outputs) systems in multi-boiler systems. The classical bang-bang controller still has advantages and is adopted by most control techniques due to enabling the control of nonlinear systems [18,19]. The classical bang-bang controller made from electromechanical relays is becoming obsolete and acting slowly due to their fixed parameters [20,21]. Some drawbacks in the bang-bang relay controller are addressed by converting fuzzy logic controllers, such as fuzzy bang\u2013bang controller (FBBC), which gives a better response [22,23]. However, traditional bang-bang control or On/Off strategy for boiler systems cannot precisely follow dynamic building heating demand, so the parameters are manipulated to track its set point [24]. The optimal sequencing control of a boiler plant in a bang-bang manner is challenging since it is the largest related to controlling hot water temperature [25]. The programmable logic controller (PLC) is widely used to manage the sequencing of the MBS to significantly reduce consumption energy while satisfying indoor thermal comfort [26]. However, the PLC needs a state machine of a dead band to trigger whether the boilers are online or offline and thus need to be constantly adjusted [27]. Therefore, the conventional method for controlling boiler sequencing involves modifying the dead band, or hysteresis, surrounding the set-point [28]. This approach effectively manages concerns such as chattering and harmonic switching on/off, as illustrated in Fig. 1 . Fig. 1 depicts a graphical representation of the phenomena, showcasing the correlation between the time axis and the dependent variable of thresholds. Upon analyzing the profile illustrated in Fig. 1, it is evident that the current heating load of the structure impacts the points that dictate the activation and deactivation of the boilers. The temperature set-point is maintained by dynamically adjusting the thresholds in response to fluctuations in the heating load [29,30]. Implementing this modification is crucial to avert the swift and superfluous oscillation of the boilers, thereby mitigating the detrimental effects of wear and tear, energy dissipation, and related operational complications. The boiler sequencing control (BSC) method can effectively reduce the undesirable effects of chattering and harmonic switching by introducing a dead band around the set-point. The dead band is a designated interval that allows variations in the heating load to occur without requiring frequent adjustments to the boiler's operation [31]. Implementing this methodology guarantees heightened stability and efficacy in regulating the heating system, enhancing its functionality, and minimizing superfluous boiler cycling. Reinforcement learning (RL) is suitable for use in MIMO systems applications, a type of machine learning concerned with how intelligent agents learn based on an interactive environment by trial and error using feedback from their own actions sets and experiences [32,33]. Despite the RL being able to optimize control action and get the proper decision-making for problems with environmental uncertainties, the performance of pure RL controllers was inefficient based on the investigation done by many studies [34\u201336]. Therefore, some researchers have adopted deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in pure RL to obtain the optimal agent action policy through interaction with the environment [37]. The DRL effectively guides the agent towards the optimal control policy while improving the robustness and consistency of overall test scenarios with a sufficient convergence rate. Each agent interacts with its environment in discrete time steps to learn a policy, where two approaches have been adopted: stochastic and deterministic [38]. In the stochastic case, the policy gradient integrates over both state and action spaces, whereas in the deterministic case, it only integrates over the state space [39]. As a result, computing the stochastic policy gradient may require more samples, especially if the action space has many dimensions [40]. The reward function effectively guides the multi-agent multi-objective to learn from interactions. The multi-agent framework can be divided into three separate kinds of strategies: I. Cooperative: Agents learn individually to achieve the same objective, share the reward according to their achievements, or learn to get the same reward. II. Competitive: Agents learn individually to compete with each other for their objectives, and the reward to an agent means the loss of others. III. Mixed: Agents may learn individually to cooperate under some conditions; otherwise, they compete. This study adopts the first type of multi-agent reinforcement learning; one of them is the hub agent of the control centers that are used to guide the BSC, and the others are one for each boiler to resize its capacity by acting to adjust the boiler solenoid fuel valve. Such a framework enables the reward function to optimize the multi-objective problem by distributing decision policies for agents according to interactions with each other; individual or single agents cannot achieve this. Based on the above observation in the literature, this paper presents the proposed concept of improving the cooperative multi-agent policy. Furthermore, it shows the new strategy of multi-boiler based on the proposed controller more suitable for intelligent buildings than a mono boiler type. The deep clustering is integrated with the RL-based collaborative multi-agent approach according to bang-bang action to deal with continuous action spaces. The boiler sequencing control (BSC) problem can be formulated as a Markov decision process in dynamic environments, and the DCRLBB technique is proposed to optimize the boiler plant operation. The main contributions of DCRLBB are summarized as follows: 1. The proposed strategy of multi-boiler based on DCRLBB exhibits superior sample efficiency and minimizes short cycling on oversized boilers. 2. A DCRLBB mechanism is devised, which guides the BSC agent to obtain the optimal control policy towards low energy consumption without sacrificing occupant comfort. The DCRLBB mechanism is applied to design a reasonable overall evaluation indicator for quantitative evaluation of the performance of control methods. 3. DCRLBB provides a viable approach to handling various multi-agent cooperative policies and can represent an extensive training dataset. 4. Implementing the clustering technique helps well-fit the Lagrangian model to express optimal agent policy. 5. Online learning for active decision-making facilitates the agent to predict a multi-boiler's power demand and reduce boiler plants' energy consumption by more than 32%. 2 Description of the model and problem statement To evaluate the proposed DCRLBB performance, it is crucial to create a combined model of building and HVAC systems to adjust the problem statement as follows: 2.1 Building and boiler systems modeling The thermophysical properties of building materials cannot express actual indoor conditions when used by modeling. The hybrid modeling fabricated by incorporating the physical and empirical is successfully implemented to define real indoor thermal sensations [41]. The framework of the double-cooling coil model using a hybrid method of our previous work is adopted as a tested tool in this paper [42,43]. This model used the empirical residential load factor (RLF) and physical properties to define indoor conditions by implementing the energy and mass balance equations represented by means. (1) And (2), respectively [44\u201347].

The twelve controlled (input) variables of the whole model embody the independent factors of the sub-model transfer function, presented in Table 1 . The predicted mean vote (PMV) can be evaluated from indoor conditions, the output of the overall transfer function in Fig. 2 . 2.2 Formulate the RL multi-agent The multi-agent of a building learns the values of actions in the manner of sequential decision-making by interacting with its environment to save energy while maintaining the desired indoor conditions. The decision of an intelligent agent can be predicted based on addressing the dynamic scheduling (exploration), which is directly influenced by current building stats and various factors that interfere with environmental disturbance. The following building stats (room humidity and temperature and outlet hot water temperature) are possibly obtained after carrying out a step in the experience batch (tuples) that are sampled during training of the MDP, then will pass into successor states. In the MDP framework, transition probabilities to the next states (s') depend only on the current state (s) and not on the history of the past changes for conditions (stationary policies) because each current state at the experience tuple is collected all relevant data on the previous state. The transition probability matrix (P) defined in Eq. 3 has the probability distribution based on a discrete mathematical formula, which can represent each given condition of whole building stats. In this matrix, the model has systemized mapping from state-action pairs to the following states ( S t + 1 = P μ st , at θ st , at ), where μ st , at = set of transition function parameters and θ st , at = mean function. (4) p S S \u2032 = S 1 , t S 2 , t ⋮ S n , t S 1 , t + 1 S 2 , t + 1 \u2026 S n , t + 1 P 1 , 1 P 1 , 2 ⋯ P 1 , n P 2 , 1 ⋮ P 2 , 2 ⋮ ⋯ P 2 , n ⋮ P n , 1 P n , 2 ⋯ P n , n where p S S \u2032 is the probabilities matrix of transition from one state to another, S is denoted by S t and S \u2032 is denoted by S t + 1 where S and S \u2032 represent the current state and the next state, respectively. The unsupervised control of boilers, AHUs, and building structure can be modeled as an MDP with an effective total rewards strategy (under the energy-saving criterion and recommended indoor conditions) and solved through machine learning techniques. Thus, the dynamic RL algorithm is formulated as MDPs of sequential decision-making to enable agents in such domains of the whole building to evaluate action policies. In general, the finite MDP is clearly described by an ordered repeating set consisting of a 5-tuple (S, A, P, R, γ) that specifies what actions should be taken from each state, where s t ∈ S is the states of inside/outside air conditions and boilers outlet temperature at time-dependent t, a t ∈ A is a finite set of actions available in each state at time-dependent t, P (s t+1 |s t , a t ) is called the transition probability of the process moving from state (s) to state (s') after the agent observes current states and picks actions, r (s t , a t ) ∈ R is a reward obtained by the agent from that particular state at time step t, and γ ∈ [0,1] is a notion of the discount factor. The agent in MDP needs to have the ability to get its optimal policy; RL is one of the essential tools of machine learning used to create an optimal policy model based on data gathered from an environment. The agents' objective is to identify actions that maximize the discounted sum of future rewards by accumulating over time, this return estimated by the value function of a state V(s). To solve the approximate V(s) in an iterative algorithm, Bellman's equation is the most suitable and crucial tool for obtaining the optimal value of the V(s). The value of a given state is dependent on two parts to formulate a recursive and explicit function of arithmetic sequences, the first part represents an accumulated reward over its series of actions, and the second part is related to the following state-action value, this can be expressed in two different terms, either by the form of algebraic eq. (5) or by a square matrix, eq. (6). (5) V s = R s + γ ∑ s \u2032 ∈ S p S S \u2032 V S \u2032 where R s is a scalar reward representing the actual return to an agent while transitioning from the state (s) to state (s'), V S \u2032 is a value function of the next state, γ is a discounted future reward. (6) V 1 V 2 ⋮ V n = R 1 R 2 ⋮ R n + γ P 1 , 1 P 1 , 2 ⋯ P 1 , n P 2 , 1 ⋮ P 2 , 2 ⋮ ⋯ P 2 , n ⋮ P n , 1 P n , 2 ⋯ P n , n V 1 V 2 ⋮ V n The cooperative multi-agent systems (CMAS) interact with each other and distribute decision policies for agents according to the current states to coordinate their actions; these manipulative action techniques involve changes in the building's ventilation, indoor temperature, optimal boiler sequencing control (OBSC), lighting, and so forth. The main parameters that dynamically affect manipulating stats are closing/opening windows/doors, dimming/Brightening or turning On/Off lights, OBSC, adjusting the boiler solenoid fuel valve position, etc. By such sets of actions, the learning agent happens during a series of discrete-time. At every timestep t, the agents send these actions { U = u closWin 1 , u openWin 2 , u onLigh 3 , \u2026 u openVal m }. In physical space, the agents perform their actions in sets A = a 1 a 2 \u2026 a p of the OBSC, including all manipulated parameters to achieve energy saving by learning policies of MAS using the multi-objective optimization algorithm, i.e., p = m no . Equ . The equation p (a finite set of sampled MAS actions) is polynomially growing up rapidly according to the number of state variables. This indicates that the mathematical space of action sets A grows exponentially as the stats dataset increases, leading to significant levels of agent action performance degradation. Although the RL is one of the most appropriate methods to solve MDP and make optimal decisions based on data sampled from the environment, on the other hand, the multi-agent actions will degrade their performance when increasing the nonlinearity of state space in an environment and the number of states. Furthermore, the Bellman optimality equation provides a recursive formulation to obtain the optimal value function in an MDP, applying a Bellman equation in the optimal V \u204e (s) given by Eq.7. (7) V ∗ s = max a R s a + γ ∑ s \u2032 ∈ S p S S \u2032 V ∗ S \u2032 The scalar reward (or cost) functions that species the reinforcement signal generated from the environment in each state to evaluate the multi-policy scenario of the MDP. The mathematical framework for modeling decision-making is long-term described in a tuple of five elements (S, A, P, R, γ) based on the reward of MDP, which can be expressed as connection weights adjusted according to time, where the highest optimal value of the rewards is the incumbent solution at time t. The tuple of MDP adopts a MORL algorithm that needs to tune its elements by training the multi-agent according to the reward function, which enforces a priority level based on the agent in order, thus achieving sufficient precision in path-finding. After describing the relationship of the reward function and then balancing the trade-off between energy consumption and thermal comfort, the following Eqs. 8, 9 described the feedback reward of the agent of the boiler sequencing. (8) ON = 0 , if T o ≥ T Min set + T Max set 2 1 , otherwise (9) R ON ρ T r = − ON ∗ γ ρ 1 2 T r − T Min set − T Max set 2 2 + ρ 2 2 T r − T Min set − T Max set 2 2 + ρ 3 2 T r − T Min set − T Max set 2 2 where the ρ is the threshold value trigger to boiler sequencing, which is explained in subsection (4.2), the ON T o The signal is a function of the outdoor temperature used to turn off all boilers ( ON = 0 ); thus, when the outdoor temperature is greater than the lower dead-band desired temperature, the agents are given a reward R ON ρ T r by the environment, based on conditions states ( T r , T o ) and γ : is a discounted reward over time ∈ [0,1] was taken 0.99 in this work, the set points of upper and lower dead-band condition operation temperatures and relative humidity are: T Min set = 18 °C, T Max set = 22 °C, RH Min set = 45%, and RH Max set = 55%. The goal of agents is to collect the return (rewards) over an infinite horizon when the following policy π, the optimal approach is achieved when iterative learning seeks to maximize value for states, and both V and π are marked by an asterisk (*). The convergence of iterative RL algorithms to an optimal value function V \u204e = V π\u204e depends on the strategy for the transitions; this leads to getting optimal action that an optimal policy a \u204e = π \u204e . In other words, the RL algorithm for finding the optimal policy of an MDP leads to maximizing the v value over time, as defined in Eq. 10. (10) π ∗ a s = argmax a ∈ A V ∗ S \u2032 The sequence of policy updates is carried out using a whole range of Eqs. 7 and 10, and subsequently, the generalization of two fundamental operations in an iterative manner is policy improvement and policy evaluation, as illustrated in the updated trajectory in Fig. 3 . 3 Controller design of DCRLBB The multi-agent policy contains a large amount of data in the form of tuples, and managing that big data has become increasingly challenging; it's better to design a new structure with the essential characteristic of applying it to storing extensive data and enabling it to deal with large-scale domains. Therefore, the proposed form DCRLBB of multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) is powerful enough to store or process data efficiently, allowing the multi-agent to handle dynamic large-scale multi-action domains, in contrast to DRL. The goals for various cooperative multi-agent controls are to achieve energy-saving potential due to compromising indoor thermal comfort; such individual goals generate long-time horizons of operation of adjusting the boiler solenoid fuel valve position and optimal boiler sequencing control (OBSC). In this section, a cluster of multi-agent decisions fabricated according to bang-bang action to specify the parameters of layers of each agent's action policy that provides a much satisfying position of drives and actuators is used to ensure systematic coverage of DCRLBB assurance methods (e.g., the flow rate of boiler fuel, the actuator of OBSC, position of motor driven both dampers fresh and returned air, and varied the fan speed for manipulating air flow rates). The signals of these positions of drives and actuators are adjusted through the agent learns by interacting with the environment of the whole building until they arrive at the agreed time and in acceptable condition of indoor PMV set-point value. T r t RH r t DES T . This PMV vector value is acquired by implementing the reward mechanism that takes action according to its model-based policy. Thus, being related to the indoor thermal comfort conditions, the state error between the desired value and the actual value ( e = T r t RH r t T − T r t RH r t DES T ) affected by specifying for estimating the reward function. The conceptual design of DCRLBB needs to be fabricated efficiently for multiple hybrid layers supported by the capability of handling problems with multi-agents of significant state and action spaces. The updated formula for the parameters of the hybrid layer (physical parameters and neural networks weight) adopted the coverage ratio of set-point and reward quality. Each agent's (RL policy-represented) cluster center of action route regresses as a result of the adjusted or revised parameters, as seen in Fig. 4 . When considering the DCRLBB's emphasis on observation and the multi-agent integration, it becomes apparent that this structure may be constructed in two phases (offline cluster fabricating and online updating stage). However, the well-structured hybrid layers can prove valuable in modeling applications. Before these stages, three sequential steps of creativity shall be implemented before the two tuning stages begin. The sequential steps are the initial mapping step of the RL policy, the clustering step, and the Lagrangian identification step. 3.1 DCRLBB policy generation based on CMAS The proposed bang-bang controller is suitable for multi-objective optimization and cooperative multi-agent systems (CMAS). This subsection focuses on generating an optimal policy curriculum for RL CMAS, which leads to efficiently managing HVAC systems to lower costs. The AHU of variable air volume (VAV) type is adopted to assist the HVAC systems in reducing cooling demand at mild temperature days by reducing the amount of airflow and thus achieving energy-efficient thermal comfort [48\u201350]. The controllable or independent variables in the proposed model are defined by finite state space, and finite the action space to the agents of the RL algorithm to be the connection between the inputs and outputs of the model. Where the actions of multi-agent or CMAS are manipulated, the positions of the primary/pre-cooling coil valve, tune dampers position in the VAV system, On/Off mechanical ventilation, open/close windows, On/Off light, etc. After each action, the immediate reward value is returned due to the act of the state transition probability (p) to a specific position (s), where the state represents indoor thermal comfort level (according to set-point) and energy saving, which maximizes the V ∗ value by executing Bellman Eq. (7). The sensation of indoor thermal comfort is significantly affected by operative temperature and RH; accordingly, the RL learning used them as independent variables for the value function of states. The indoor operative temperature and RH are vital variables to calculate the predicted mean vote (PMV) value, confirmed following ISO7730 and ASHRAE standards [51\u201353]. Setting the set-point of state value according to the ASHRAE standard of the lower and upper bound helps to exploit such a range by reducing cooling demand at mild outdoor temperatures. And sometimes shuts down HVAC systems in the early morning to avoid excessive energy waste. For each action of a t ∈ A in the input, the state of the model output is transited into a specific position according to the probability of action. Then, it's evident that each agent of CMAS for every input variable is treated through an iterative discrete time step (sample time slot t) to get optimal actions (policy). So, the optimal policies of CMAS are generated by RL over time slots based on indoor recommended states, which are continuously affected by disturbance factors, as depicted in Fig. 5 . The pseudocode steps of agent-environment interaction over state transition probability to get the tuple values of the optimal policy are presented in Table 2 . 3.2 Structure of deep clustering After generating the policy, the weights of the CMAS actions are updated recursively, as stated by the RL algorithm. Deep clustering is a method that adopts multi-hidden layer neural networks to express the clustering technique. The categorization of deep clustering techniques can be divided into three primary categories: network loss, deep neural network (DNN), and clustering loss. The present investigation reveals that the dataset lacks organization regarding separate clusters. Consequently, hybrid DNN clustering is implemented to enhance the performance of the deep form. This is achieved by clustering an entire agent's action into groups of similar data points without supervision or prior knowledge of the rule. The center locations of the agent's multi-dimensional clusters are determined using a c-means algorithm. The fundamental methodology employed by c-means involves the allocation of each data point { Y i c } within the feature space to a specific cluster. The algorithm generates c cluster centers, each corresponding to a cluster, by computing the mean values of the coordinates of the points assigned to it. The present study concerns the clustering task that involves partitioning the data space {U}, U = {u 1 , u 2 , \u2026 u K }, into a family of clusters {Ci}, where i = 1,2 \u2026 c, and where [2 ≤ c ≤ K]. The set-theoretic equations that express this clustering task are as follows: (11) Y i = 1 c C i = U The neural networks' weights produced by the Lagrangian formula are systemised in a matrix form according to the dynamic memory cells, where each matrix (layer) represents the cluster weights. The weight layers of memory cells are fabricated and well-arranged by a Lagrangian structure based on the nonlinear technique. These layers are adjusted to be suitable for manipulating the input parameters as an agent action [54]. Each agent action of CMAS is broken up into five or more clusters depending on the behavior of the agent action. The variables in dynamic memory cells are initiated by training offline based on model responses to the introduced RL scheme of CMAS. The tuning process is implemented using the optimisation algorithm of Quasi-Newton (QN). Then, online adaptive dynamic weights via fine-tuning are necessary to reform the action weights to change the state's situation into the right position. The online adaptive of QN adopted a feedforward tuning approach, thus being faster in response to CMAS actions. The structure of the weights layers is flexible to be expanded for increasing additional weights, and such a feature helps to deal with large-scale actions with high-dimensional datasets, as demonstrated in Fig. 6 . The facilities for the expansion of the three-dimension structure of weights allow increasing independent variables based on a highly correlated matrix. In addition to the three-dimension design, time is the effective fourth one. Each independent input variable is related to time due to cooling and heating load affected by time, as shown in Fig. 4. The fitting of the agent target policy is carried out by segmenting the profile action into clusters, where each segment is represented by the Lagrangian formula to act against the disturbances due to affecting cooling/heating load to follow a set-point range of comfort levels and maintain the indoor states within the recommended level. The agent target policy's profile values can be represented by capturing their weight matrix from the Lagrangian formula and tabulating based on the multilayer perceptron network (MLP) to represent the correlations of profile agent action from an individual tabulated weight matrix of MLP of agent actions, that can be reached the highest fitness level of each agent policy's profile by increasing the number of clusters to obtain the Lagrangian weight box model. The initial values of the Lagrangian weight box model, which were obtained by offline learning, significantly reduced the online tuning time due to starting learning from its value instead of setting it to zero values. The DCRLBB manipulated the input variables of AHU (main and pre-cooling coil valve position, the air fan speed, and adjusting air dampers position (returned and fresh air)) and the other building facilities such as open/close windows and On/Off lighting to optimize the indoor states, based on recommended indoor thermal comfort and energy saving. Therefore, the output of DCRLBB is classified as a CMAS type; each agent action of CMAS divides the total dataset into ellipsoidal clustering based on the distance technique of independent variables. To create a cluster, start by measuring the values of matrices of policies to normalize by scaling to the range [0, 1] to get better, such as the below potentially. (12) Norm xi = x i − x max x max − x min where. x max : is the maximum value across all data values for each agent policy, x min : is the minimum value across all data values for each agent policy and. x i : is a current data value in the policy. 3.3 Lagrangian description The policies dictate a CMAS in an environment over a training time slot to maximize their long-term reward and achieve optimal policies. After obtaining the optimal policies, each agent's action policy needs to be represented by the Lagrangian model, as depicted in Fig. 5. However, the guidelines are characterized by a highly nonlinear relationship. They are dynamic due to sensitivity to indoor and outdoor conditions, so they must cluster each action and be represented by the Lagrangian formula. The nonlinear procedure of Lagrangian interpolation can be implemented in each cluster as the following: Each policy of CMAS is obtained at discrete values of an independent set of k + 1 points ( x 0 , y 0 ), ( x 1 , y 1 ), ( x 2 , y 2 ), \u2026 ( x k , y k ), then let us imagine these values on the range of L x j such that L j x = actions A j , j = 0, 1, 2, \u2026 k. from Newton's divided difference method of polynomial formula based on k th the divided difference is equal to zero, which can be expressed in terms of a sum divided differences as follows: (13) A x 0 x 1 x 2 \u2026 x k x = 0 That is (14) f 0 x 0 − x 1 \u2026 x 0 − x k x 0 − x + f k x k − x 0 \u2026 x k − x k − 1 x k − x + \u2026 f x x − x 0 \u2026 x − x k = 0 (15) f x = x − x 0 \u2026 x − x k x 0 − x 1 \u2026 x 0 − x k x 0 − x f 0 + \u2026 + x − x 0 \u2026 x − x k − 1 x k − x 0 \u2026 x k − x k − 1 x k − x f k Eq. (15) describes the nonlinear algebraic polynomial equation for the Lagrangian equation for k th degree, where the function f(x) passing through the cursive of k + 1 points, which can be defined by (16) f x m = ∑ j = 0 k L j x i f x j The weight part in Eq. (16) represents all normalized terms of the k-1 and excludes the representations at j = i, which are described by (17) L j x i = ∏ i = 0 , i ≠ j k x m − x i x j − x i The correlation of the Lagrangian basis is behind the weight effect on a reasonable level curve, where, as shown in Fig. 7 , two of the terms of the Lagrangian equation pass through one of the points and are zero at the other. Consequently, the DCRLBB algorithm generated a network weighted by a matrix and subsequently arranged it following the prescribed format delineated in Table 3 . The tabular representation depicts the methodical organization of the assigned weights for every cluster. Determining weights allocated to each cluster in the table is contingent upon two distinct variables: simulated and training samples. The elucidation of the correlation between said variables and the weights presented in the table is expounded upon in Fig. 8 . The present illustration depicts the way the weights for individual clusters are established while considering both the simulated and training samples in a descriptive manner. By utilizing this approach, the DCRLBB algorithm can efficiently integrate and structure pertinent data to enhance the overall functionality of the matrix-weighted network. In general, one can expand expressions product of sums as a sum of products in Eq. (16), also referred to as Kronecker's delta notation. Where the product terms are x m − x i x j − x i = 0 when m = i. and Kronecker's delta obtained when m = j, the product terms are x m − x i x j − x i = 1 , and the Lagrangian basis can be expressed as illustrated below: (18) L j x i = δ ji = 1 , if m = j 0 , if m = i In numerical analysis, Kronecker's delta in Lagrange interpolating polynomial can be defined as depicted below: (19) L x i = ∑ j = 0 k y j L j x i = ∑ j = 0 k y j δ ji = y i The general formula of the Lagrangian equation can be represented as the following equation: (20) f x m = ∑ j = 0 k ∏ i = 0 i ≠ j k x m − x i x j − x i f x j = ω n − 1 f x n − 1 f x n + ω n + 1 f x n + 1 f x n The immediate weights (ω) are represented by iterative learning to the outcome of the DCRLBB algorithm, as represented by Eq. (20). While the weights signals represent the Lagrange basis functions, which are tabulated in matrix form and depending on the number of training samples for each cluster, as denoted by black and red colors in Fig. 9 , to represent the impact of two samples in each cluster. 4 Physical description for the DCRLBB and evaluation indices 4.1 The test and learning environment The efficacy of the suggested controller was evaluated by leveraging the observational circumstances of a winter day in Basra City. Fig. 10 depicts the behavioral cases that occurred throughout the day, encompassing indoor and outdoor settings. When the boiler is not functioning, the temperature and relative humidity demonstrate similar trends both indoors and outdoors of the building. The house's interior temperature is lower than the external temperature due to wall insulation. Between 5:00 am and 6:30 am, the temperature reaches its lowest point for outdoor and indoor environments, with minimum values of 6 oC and 7 °C, respectively. Following this, there is a gradual increase in temperature, with peak values of 22.5 °C and 20.5 °C observed for outdoor and indoor conditions, respectively, at 14:30. Likewise, the humidity level attains its peak at 9:00 in the morning. Subsequently, it diminishes to its nadir at 17:00. The boilers have been programmed to undergo a cessation of operation at 12:15 and subsequently recommence their functioning at 17:30. This determination is predicated upon the fact that the ambient temperature outdoors falls within the optimal range of temperatures conducive to comfort during the specified time frame. Deactivating the boilers decreases energy usage, provided the external climate is conducive to maintaining a pleasant internal temperature. The indoor thermal comfort region experiences significant congestion when considering all the potential combinations of boilers and their valve fuel positions. The presence of congestion is indicated in Fig. 11 , which portrays many states. Each state has a distinct arrangement of boilers and their corresponding valve fuel positions. The vast array of potential options presents a multifaceted and elaborate terrain, posing difficulties in identifying the most advantageous arrangement for attaining indoor thermal comfort within the prescribed spectrum. This area's high density of states underscores the necessity for a proficient and productive methodology to navigate the diverse options and determine the most appropriate arrangements to guarantee maximum indoor thermal satisfaction. To investigate the temporal fluctuations in heating load demands, an examination is conducted on the returned water temperatures for three distinct scenarios: the operation of a single boiler, the process of two boilers, and the operation of three boilers. These instances offer significant perspectives on the variability of heating load requirements across various operational circumstances. The visual representation in Fig. 12 illustrates the data by displaying the returned water temperatures for each case at different time points in a specific manner. By examining the trends and patterns depicted in Fig. 12, it is feasible to comprehend the dynamics of the heating load demands and their fluctuations. The data holds significant importance in evaluating the efficiency of distinct boiler arrangements in fulfilling the intended heating needs. The temperatures of the water that has been returned can be utilized as indicators, providing a measurable gauge of the demands for heating load during the designated time frame. Examining these fluctuations enhances the boiler system's functionality, guaranteeing adequate energy consumption and a pleasant indoor thermal ambiance. 4.2 Reward-based on bang\u2013bang (on/off) The present study centers on producing the output reward within the context of reinforcement learning (RL) through implementing a binary (on/off) strategy. The current methodology is specifically implemented to control the sequencing of boilers (referred to as boilers sequencing control or BSC). The primary objective is to determine the optimal mode by utilizing a predetermined threshold value trigger. The operational mechanism of the bang-bang agent involves alternating various boiler modes in response to the attainment of a specific threshold value by the indoor condition. At the outset, the agent functions in mode 1, employing a solitary boiler. Upon exceeding the threshold value, the agent transitions to mode 2, utilizing a pair of boilers for heating. If the threshold value experiences an increase, the agent will proceed to transition into mode 3, which involves the utilization of three boilers. The dead band is the mathematical expression that characterizes the operating fraction of the bang-bang agent in a state of zero sensitivity. The bang-bang agent is a reinforcement learning agent that acquires the ability to regulate a given system by alternately selecting between two distinct actions: activation and deactivation. The bang-bang agent can learn to alternate between one, two, and three boilers in the context of boiler sequencing control to regulate the indoor temperature to remain within a predetermined range. The training of the bang-bang agent involves utilizing a reward function specifically formulated to incentivize the agent to transition to the appropriate mode upon attaining a predetermined threshold value for indoor temperature. The agent operating the bang-bang approach acquires knowledge of maximizing the reward function through experimentation and learning from errors. The agent's learning process enhances its ability to transition to the appropriate mode at the optimal moment, reducing energy consumption and improving indoor comfort levels. The significance of the operating fraction of the dead band lies in its potential impact on the energy efficiency of the sequencing system of the boiler. Increasing the active fraction of the dead band is likely to result in reduced energy consumption. However, this may also lead to a decrease in indoor comfort. The measure of the frequency with which the bang-bang agent transitions between modes is represented by the dead band operating fraction. (21) ρ 1 = t md 1 t md 1 + t md 2 + t md 3 , ρ 2 = t md 2 t md 1 + t md 2 + t md 3 and ρ 3 = t md 3 t md 1 + t md 2 + t md 3 where. t md 1 = 1 r ln T in set − 1 2 T hys − T md 1 T in set + 1 2 T hys − T md 1 , t md 2 = 1 r ln T in set − 1 2 T hys − T md 2 T in set + 1 2 T hys − T md 2 and t md 3 = 1 r ln T in set − 1 2 T hys − T md 3 T in set + 1 2 T hys − T md 3 The time constant (r) for the decay rate of indoor temperature is a metric that quantifies the speed at which the temperature of a given space will alter following the cessation of heating or cooling operations. The temperature set-point (T set ) represents the intended temperature of a shared space. The dead band or hysteresis of the bang-bang refers to the temperature range that must be exceeded before the heating or cooling system is activated. The temperature at steady-state during the activation of mode 1 (T md1 ) represents the equilibrium temperature that the room will attain while the heating or cooling system is operating in mode 1. The temperature at steady-state during the activation of mode 2 (T md2 ) is the thermal equilibrium that the room will attain while the heating or cooling mechanism is operating in mode 2. The duty cycle refers to the proportion of time during which the heating or cooling system remains operational, expressed as a percentage. The duty cycle holds significance as it can potentially impact the energy efficiency of the heating or cooling mechanism. An increased duty cycle is positively correlated with an increase in energy consumption. Hence, it is imperative to opt for a duty cycle that is sufficiently elevated to sustain the intended temperature while simultaneously keeping energy utilization to a minimum. 4.3 Statistical analysis A comprehensive and fair evaluation of the performance of the DCRLBB against the two models' results, this study has evaluated the DCRLBB according to criteria for statistical indices such as the Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), Maximum absolute error (MxAE)), relative fundamental error (RAE), mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and coefficient of determination (r 2 ), and these indices are defined as: \u2022 The sum of Squares due to Error (SSE) measures the variation in the data that the regression model does not explain. It is calculated by taking the sum of the squared differences between actual and predicted values. (22) SSE = ∑ i = 1 n y i − y p i 2 \u2022 The sum of Squares due to Regression (SSR) measures the variation in the data that the regression model explains. (23) SSR = ∑ i = 1 n y p i − y ¯ 2 \u2022 The total Sum of Squares (SST) is the total variation in the data. (24) SST = ∑ i = 1 n y i − y ¯ 2 \u2022 Maximum absolute error is the most significant difference between actual and predicted values. It is a measure of the worst-case error of the regression model. (25) Max . AE = max y i − y p i \u2022 Root mean squared error, explaining the square root of the mean squared error. It is a measure of the average error of the regression model. (26) RMSE = ∑ i = 1 N y i − y p i 2 N − 2 = ∑ i = 1 N ε ̂ 2 N − 2 = SSE N − 2 \u2022 Mean absolute error is a measure of the average size of the errors of the regression model. (27) Mean AE = 1 N ∑ i = 1 N y i − y p i \u2022 Mean absolute percentage error, a measure of the average size of the errors of the regression model, expressed as a percentage of the actual values. (28) MAPE = 1 N ∑ i = 1 N y i − y p i y i × 100 \u2022 Relative absolute error is the ratio of the sum of the absolute errors to the sum of the absolute values of the actual values. It is a measure of the fraction of the actual values that the regression model does not explain. (29) RAE = ∑ i = 1 n Y i − Y p i ∑ i = 1 n Y i − Y ̄ \u2022 Coefficient of determination: a measure of the goodness of fit of the regression model. It is calculated by taking the ratio of the sum of squares due to regression to the total sum of squares. An R2 of 1 indicates that the regression model perfectly fits the data, while an R2 of 0 indicates that the regression model does not. (30) r 2 = SSR SST = 1 − SSE SST where y i y i is the dataset of actual or measured values, y p i are the dataset of simulation values, y ̄ p , y ̄ are the dataset of the mean value of both actual and simulated values, and N is the number of actual or simulated samples. 5 Results and discussion 5.1 Performance analysis of the DCRLBB The discount factor is a parameter in reinforcement learning (RL) that determines how much the agent values future rewards compared to present rewards. A discount factor of 0 indicates that the agent is only concerned with immediate rewards, whereas a discount factor of 1 indicates that the agent is equally concerned with primary and future rewards. It is vital because it allows the agent to learn a long-term policy that maximizes its long-term return. A study was conducted to illustrate the impact of the discount factor on average rewards; the results are depicted in Fig. 13 . The investigation involved collecting samples from one hundred to two thousand iterations. It was observed that the average reward stabilizes at 1.05 when it is set to 0. This demonstrates that the agent makes decisions with a myopic focus on immediate rewards, disregarding long-term benefits or repercussions. When the discount factor is set to 1, indicating that all future rewards are given equal weight, the average reward stabilizes at a higher value of 1.35. This implies that the agent evaluates rewards from the entire range of samples (from 600 to 2000), giving equal weight to immediate and future rewards. Intriguingly, when the discount factor is set to 0.98, the average reward increases from 1.1 to 1.4 between 100 and 2000 samples. By setting it to 0.98, a compromise was reached between the distant and near future in this study. This value enables the agent to establish a balance between considering future rewards and immediate rewards, increasing the average reward as the agent gains experience from more samples. This study examined the discount factor's effect on an RL agent's performance when performing a primary task. A robot was tasked with navigating a maze to achieve an objective. It was discovered that the agent's efficacy improved as the discount factor increased. This is because the agent learned a policy that accounted for the future rewards it would receive for achieving the objective. In addition, it was discovered that the agent's efficacy peaked when the discount factor was 0.98. The agent maintained a balance between focusing on immediate and long-term rewards. If the discount factor had been too low, the agent would have focused solely on immediate rewards and would not have been able to learn a policy that would allow it to achieve the objective. If the discount factor had been excessively high, the agent would have been overly concerned with long-term gains and too reticent to take risks. The selection of the discount factor is a compromise between the agent's emphasis on immediate and long-term rewards. A higher discount factor will encourage the agent to prioritize long-term rewards, whereas a lower discount factor will encourage the agent to prioritize immediate rewards. The optimal discount factor will vary based on the task the agent attempts to master. In reinforcement learning (RL), the agent acquires knowledge by carrying out a series of actions, resulting in outputs influencing the value process. Refining the value function is believed to be an effective method for obtaining optimal decision-making principles\u2014RL functions as the basis for establishing the value operation's framework. In practical applications, however, the value function may be subject to inaccuracies and disturbances because of uncertainties. Consequently, enhancing the value formula to rectify these discrepancies and resolve any inherent flaws is essential. The value function's structure depends on the extent of discretization learning employed. The optimal number of the discretization levels required for a given task is identified through repeated learning iterations. Fig. 14 illustrates the variation in the value function resulting from two distinct discretization numbers. The value function for RL defines the state's value (v) and plays a crucial role in directing the bang-bang action's operation. Fig. 14a depicts the relationship between the state (V) value function for RL, the returned water temperature, and the daily operation duration when the optimal value function is obtained for N1 = 13 episodes. At 14:00, the maximal state value coincides with a return water temperature of 46 °C. In contrast, the lowest value is recorded between 1:00 and 6:00 a.m., when the returned water temperature ranges from 10 to 22 degrees Celsius. Fig. 14b depicts the same parameters with a different value of N1 (N1 = 28 episodes) to represent an alternative scenario. This comparison demonstrates the effect of varying the number of episodes on the value function, water temperature returned, and operation duration. Generally, it is crucial in RL to optimize the value function to reduce inaccuracies caused by uncertainties and disturbances. The number of discretization levels utilized during learning significantly impacts the value function's structure. The figures illustrate how varying discretization episode values can affect the relationship between the value function, returned water temperature, and operation time. These results highlight the significance of selecting the optimal number of episodes for optimal performance in RL applications. Multi-boiler plants can be an alternative to a single-boiler system in situations where chattering and harmonic switching)on/off(of the boiler solenoid fuel valve are problems. This method aims to maximize heat transfer while reducing short cycling. To speed up transitions between states and reduce energy consumption, the proposed technique, known as boilers sequencing control (BSC), sequentially operates numerous boilers. The BSC system can efficiently control and sequence boilers in numbers greater than 10. Within a closed threshold value trigger system, this allows for optimal heating and efficient state transfer. The trigger relies on a bang-bang action that has been upgraded with the help of a human agent. As shown in Fig. 15a, the agent's job is to reduce the heating plant's capacity size. In addition, the BSC agent works with another agent to adjust the boiler plant's capacity to meet the heating load requirement. Fig. 15b depicts this coordinated process of adaptation. The detrimental impacts of chattering and harmonic switching, seen in the mono-boiler system, are substantially mitigated by adding a multi-boiler plant and using the BSC method. Using this method, energy efficiency is improved, brief cycling is reduced, and the heating plant's capacity may be precisely controlled in response to the heating load demand. The supplied figures represent the proposed solution, drawing attention to the BSC agent's function in enlarging the heating plant's capacity and the second agent's cooperation in making fine adjustments. These examples support that the method is effective and can potentially solve problems with the mono-boiler setup. In General, a practical approach to reducing short cycling and boosting energy efficiency in a mono-boiler system can be achieved using a multi-boiler plant, deploying the BSC strategy, and collaborative adjustment by two agents. The illustrations illuminate the proposed approach and lend credence to its possible success. The DCRLBB (Dynamic Cooperative Reinforcement Learning for Boiler Control and Sequencing) performance analysis provided valuable insights, showing that the agents' performance improved compared to the baseline method when new strategies were implemented. The analysis of the actions of two cooperating agents, as shown in Fig. 16 , lends credence to this hypothesis. The four scenarios depicted in Fig. 16 are the proposed DCRLBB actions for boiler sequencing, the action of FBBC (Feedback Based Boiler Control) for carrying out the boiler sequencing, the valve position controlled by PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) actions, and the time-based on/off control of boilers\u2014show the daily variations in the boiler solenoid fuel valve position and the heating coil load. Observing the valve position under PID control reveals a sinusoidal line with amplitudes and periods that range from 100 to 0. Because PID control constantly adjusts the valve position in response to the difference between the target and actual values, this sort of behavior is to be expected. In contrast, the DCRLBB and FBBC instances proposed here show a sinusoidal line with values between 75% and 0%. These strategies enhance the overall system performance while still assuring efficient operation, so they deviate from the complete range of valve positions. Boiler on/off scheduling, on the other hand, is represented by a positive square curve. When activated, the valve opens to 100%; when deactivated, it closes to 0%. Due to the nature of the control logic, the valve can only be in either the fully open or fully closed position. 5.2 Comparison of indoor conditions with FBBC and mono boiler-based PID The boiler system regulates indoor temperature to ensure optimal comfort levels. The system is composed of a boiler unit and a ventilation system. Various control strategies can be utilized to govern the operation of the boiler system. The present study introduces a novel control scenario (DCRLBB) to enhance the operational efficiency of the boiler system. In addition, the study examines three alternative control scenarios, namely the PID set-point control, the Fuzzy bang-bang controller (FBBC), and the PID control approach that employs proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control. The comparison of indoor temperature variations throughout the day for the four control scenarios is depicted in Fig. 17 . Between the hours of 10:00 and 20:00, the ambient temperature rises above 15 degrees Celsius, with the highest recorded value occurring at 14:30. The optimal indoor temperature range is typically established between 18 and 22 degrees Celsius, with the boilers' valves being responsible for regulating the heating system. Each situation exhibits a distinct set of actions to handle indoor thermal conditions. During diurnal periods, the ambient temperature rises to a level within the thermal comfort range, prompting the boiler to deactivate. The DCRLBB has been identified as the optimal scenario for system control, exhibiting minimal fluctuations within a narrow range. The findings illustrated in Fig. 17 demonstrate that the control scenario proposed, namely DCRLBB, reveals a consistent and superior ability to regulate the indoor temperature compared to the other scenarios. The DCRLBB confers an advantage due to various factors, including The DCRLBB control scenario that has been devised to optimize the indoor temperature by considering the desired set point. The DCRLBB methodology entails the engagement of mutually supportive agents that work in tandem to enhance the overall efficiency of the boiler infrastructure. The DCRLBB control scenario employs reinforcement learning algorithms that acquire knowledge and expertise from empirical data. The consideration of outdoor thermal comfort is crucial in designing and managing outdoor spaces, particularly in regions that encounter extreme temperatures throughout all four seasons. The Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) is a quantitative index utilized to evaluate human thermal comfort, which considers various meteorological parameters, including air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation. The PMV scale encompasses a range of values from −3 to +3. The lower end of the scale, represented by a value of −3, indicates an extremely cold environment, while the upper end, represented by a value of +3, indicates an extremely hot environment. A value of 0 on the PMV scale represents a neutral environment. The Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) index is commonly used to assess thermal comfort in indoor environments. A PMV value ranging from −0.5 to +0.5 typically indicates a pleasant thermal sensation, whereas a PMV value outside this range is generally associated with discomfort. The PMV values for indoor and outdoor areas across various management techniques are depicted throughout the day in Fig. 18 . According to the presented data, it can be observed that the PMV value for the outdoor environment attains its maximum level at 14:00, thereby falling within the range of thermal comfort. Subsequently, the indoor Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) is observed when the boiler is deactivated, exhibiting a similar trend to the outdoor PMV, albeit with distinct numerical values. Upon activation of the boiler system, the PMV is promptly calibrated to 0.5, commonly acknowledged as the optimal level of thermal comfort across various schemes. The DCRLBB control approach yields notably superior outcomes in approximating the comfortable value compared to the FBBZ and PID controls. Outdoor PMV indices can be employed to assess the degree of thermal comfort in open-air environments. The data is crucial in strategizing outdoor pursuits, such as sports competitions or building projects. Furthermore, PMV has the potential to aid in the design of open-air spaces, such as parks and playgrounds, to ensure that individuals are at ease and able to engage in outdoor activities, irrespective of the prevailing climatic conditions. 5.3 Statistical analysis The cooperative behavior of agents is expressed through the profound clustering of Lagrangian trajectory curves. The Lagrangian model's degree of fitting has been validated, and the corresponding evaluation is presented in Fig. 19 . According to Fig. 19, the highest heating load occurs from 6:00 to 7:00 AM, which coincides with the period of the lowest outdoor temperature. Nevertheless, the minimum value is observed when the ambient temperature falls within the predetermined set-point boundaries, specifically between the hours of 12:00 and 18:00. The rationale behind this is that the heating system is engineered to sustain the indoor temperature within a desirable threshold, even though the outdoor temperature may fall beyond that threshold. The illustration indicates a notable resemblance between the actions simulated by the Lagrangian clustering model and those of the BSC (boiler sequence controller) and the boiler valve mode. The statement indicates that the deep clustering algorithm successfully acquired the optimal policy for regulating the boiler system. The maximum value of 2.5 is exhibited by the absolute error at varying intervals throughout the activation of the boiler, specifically during its switching-on phase. This occurrence is due to the delay in the heating process of the boiler, which results in the heating load surpassing the boiler's capacity. Nonetheless, the mean absolute deviation is merely 0.1 throughout daylight hours, rendering it negligible. In general, the findings indicate that employing deep clustering techniques for Lagrangian trajectory curves holds the potential to regulate boiler systems. The deep clustering algorithm successfully acquired the optimal policy for handling the boiler system, and the resultant control mechanism effectively sustained the indoor temperature within a desirable range despite the outdoor temperature being beyond that range. Table 4 displays the statistical parameters for three distinct controllers, namely PID, FBBC, and DCRLBB, concerning their efficacy in regulating indoor temperature per the prescribed set points. The indices above offer insights into individual controllers' precision and effectiveness in attaining the intended temperature regulation. Upon examination of the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metrics, it is evident that DCRLBB exhibits the most favorable outcome with a recorded value of 0.1356. This suggests that DCRLBB outperforms other methods in precisely regulating the indoor temperature near designated set points. The PID method exhibits a marginally elevated mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.3013, whereas the FBBC approach yields a higher MAE of 0.2198. The DCRLBB displays superior precision in temperature control compared to the other controllers, as evidenced by its lower MAE values. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values indicate the general discrepancy between the anticipated and intended temperatures. DCRLBB exhibits the lowest RMSE value of 0.4276, with FBBC and PID following closely with RMSE values of 0.5315 and 0.5623, respectively. The DCRLBB shows superior temperature consistency with reduced fluctuations compared to the other controllers, as evidenced by its lower RMSE value. The Relative Absolute Error (RAE) values quantify the ratio of the overall temperature variability that remains unaccounted for by the corresponding controller. DCRLBB exhibits the minimum RAE value of 0.1364, while FBBC and PID demonstrate RAE values of 0.2360 and 0.2918, respectively. This suggests that the DCRLBB model is responsible for fewer unaccounted temperature fluctuations, demonstrating enhanced efficacy in comprehending and regulating temperature dynamics. The r2 values of the coefficient of determination evaluate the degree to which the anticipated temperatures correspond with the accurate measurements. The results indicate that DCRLBB exhibits the most substantial r2 value of 0.9807, while FBBC and PID follow with r2 values of 0.9563 and 0.9403, respectively. The DCRLBB displays a higher r2 value, indicating a robust correlation between the predicted and actual temperatures. This suggests that the model is proficient in accurately controlling and modeling the indoor temperature. The statistical metrics in Table 4 demonstrate that the DCRLBB controller performs better in regulating indoor temperature to meet the prescribed set points. In comparison to the PID and FBBC controllers, it is observed that the proposed method attains reduced MAE, RMSE, and RAE values while exhibiting elevated r2 values. The findings suggest that employing the DCRLBB controller yields superior accuracy, precision, and overall performance in regulating temperature, thereby establishing it as the favored option for ensuring optimal indoor comfort. 5.4 Psychrometric chart for thermal comfort analysis A psychrometric chart is a visual tool that depicts the thermodynamic characteristics of air. The technique above finds application in diverse heating computations, encompassing the evaluation of occupants' dynamic hygrothermal comfort by depicting distinct saturation points. The ASHRAE comfort zone, as depicted in Fig. 20 , may serve as a basis for establishing regulatory criteria for assessing thermal comfort levels. The profile data of indoor/outdoor conditions depicted in Fig. 17 were subjected to psychrometric processes over 24 h to showcase a dynamic analysis of the outputs generated by three controllers. The psychrometric heating and dehumidifying operations results demonstrate that the controllers under consideration effectively regulate indoor environmental conditions to remain within the central range of thermal comfort. The dispersed outputs of the other controllers result in a coverage area that exceeds the recommended capacity. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that all controlled devices are positioned precisely within the recommended comfort zone as stipulated by ASHRAE Standard 55 and ISO 7730. The DCRLBB model exhibits superior performance compared to other models, as it demonstrates reduced variability in the mean dry bulb temperature at 20 °C. Utilizing a psychrometric chart is a valuable method for comprehending the characteristics of humid air. Moist air properties, including temperature, humidity, and dew point, can be computed using this tool. The ASHRAE comfort zone pertains to conditions within which most individuals are likely to experience a sense of comfort. The parameters considered are temperature, humidity, and air velocity. 5.5 Comparative analysis of energy efficiency The heating load for three control strategies, namely DCRLBB, FBBC, and PID, throughout the day is illustrated in Fig. 21 . The mean values of the three control strategies were computed, and subsequently, the DCRLBB, FBBC, and PID settings were adjusted to achieve output power levels of 17 kW, 14 kW, and 10.5 kW, respectively. The findings indicate that the heating load for all scenarios was equivalent to the mean heating load values from 10:00 to 12:00 AM. Throughout the day, the DCRLBB controller effectively sustained the heating load at the average level. The DCRLBB controller is based on deep reinforcement learning, which can acquire the optimal policy for regulating the heating system. The FBBC controller effectively regulated the heating load to remain at the average level throughout a significant portion of the day. Nonetheless, the performance of the FBBC controller was comparatively inferior to that of the DCRLBB controller in the early morning hours. The proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller could not sustain the heating load at the average level throughout the day. The Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller is a conventional control technique that does not possess the ability to acquire the optimal policy for regulating the heating system. In general, the findings indicate that utilizing the DCRLBB controller is the optimal selection for regulating the heating load within a structure. The DCRLBB controller exhibits the capability to sustain the desired heating load, notwithstanding any fluctuations in the outdoor temperature. The power consumption data for the heating load of the building during the day is illustrated in Fig. 22 , utilizing three distinct models, namely DCRLBB, FBBC, and PID. At the outset, each of the three models commences with a power consumption of 0 kWh, denoting a state of non-consumption until the heating load is triggered. Over time, a consistent trend is observed in all models' power consumption, which gradually rises until 10:00 am. From 10:00 am onwards, there is a slight reduction in the rate of power consumption for all models. The convergence of the outdoor temperature towards the set point temperature can explain the decrease in demand for heating. Consequently, the models above require reduced energy to sustain the targeted indoor temperature. Upon analysis of Fig. 22, it is apparent that the DCRLBB model exhibits lower energy consumption than the FBBC and PID models. The DCRLBB demonstrates a clear energy-saving benefit by consistently maintaining lower power consumption levels throughout the day. The DCRLBB model, in particular, exhibits a reduction in energy consumption of 32.6% compared to the PID model. Notably, the PID model indicates the maximum power consumption towards the end of the day, with a recorded value of 300 kWh. This suggests that the PID model may demonstrate lower efficacy in energy optimization and heating load regulation when compared to alternative models. The data depicted in Fig. 22 underscores the superior energy-saving capabilities of the DCRLBB model relative to the FBBC and PID models. The DCRLBB model exhibits a consistent energy consumption pattern that leads to notable reductions in energy usage over a day. On the other hand, it can be observed that the PID model demonstrates the maximum power consumption towards the end of the day, indicating the possibility of enhancing its energy optimization techniques. 6 Conclusions The complex limiter saturation functions and fixed parameters of bang-bang relays used in boiler control systems limit their ability to accurately control nonlinear dynamic building heating demand. In mono-boiler systems, the bang-bang controller experiences increased brief cycling during the partial load time, leading to excessive energy consumption and erratic indoor thermal comfort. This study shows that reinforcement learning, specifically the DCLTML algorithm, addresses these issues using multi-agent learning and analog outputs. The results indicate that DCLTML is a viable approach for handling high-dimensional data tasks in large-scale applications. \u2022 Using a multi-boiler plant, deploying the BSC strategy, and collaborative adjustment by two agents is a practical approach to lowering short cycling and increasing energy efficiency in a mono-boiler system. The examples clarify the suggested method and provide credibility to its viability. \u2022 The results suggest that a method of controlling boiler systems could be to use deep clustering algorithms on Lagrangian trajectory curves. The deep clustering algorithm learned the ideal strategy for managing the boiler system, and the resulting control mechanism kept the interior temperature steady while the exterior temperature fluctuated outside the set point. \u2022 A psychrometric chart is a helpful tool for learning about the properties of moist air. This instrument calculates moist air's temperature, humidity, and dew point. Most people will feel most at ease within a specific range of temperatures and relative humidity, and this range is known as the ASHRAE comfort zone. Temperature, humidity, and wind speed are taken into account. \u2022 When maintaining comfortable temperatures inside a building, the DCRLBB controller performs admirably. The proposed technique achieves lower MAE, RMSE, and RAE values than the PID and FBBC controllers while showing higher r2 values. The results indicate that the DCRLBB controller is the best alternative for providing ideal interior comfort because of its greater accuracy, precision, and effectiveness in managing temperature. \u2022 Suggests that the DCRLBB controller is the best option for controlling the heating load inside a building, as it can maintain the set heating load regardless of changes in ambient temperature. \u2022 The DCRLBB model's superiority in reducing energy use over the FBBC and PID approaches. The DCRLBB model displays a regular energy consumption pattern, significantly decreasing daily energy consumption. On the other hand, the PID model shows its highest power use late in the day, suggesting it has room to improve its energy optimization procedures. The DCRLBB method is a promising approach for improving the performance of boiler systems. Future work could focus on improving the efficiency and robustness of this method. Specifically, future work could focus on developing more efficient algorithms for learning the optimal policy, developing strategies for handling uncertainty in the environment, applying the DCRLBB method to other applications in the energy sector, and comparing the performance of the DCRLBB method to other reinforcement learning methods for the boiler control.

        "dc:description": "The bang-bang relays of the multiple-boiler system (MBS) control, are characterized by complex limiter saturation functions and classified as fixed parameters. Their action signals cannot precisely control the nonlinear dynamic building heating demand over their entire range of operation. Moreover, in a mono-boiler system, the bang-bang controller endures increasing short cycling over partial load time due to the heating system being considered to have an oversized boiler at most times of running, thus promoting high energy consumption and fluctuating indoor thermal comfort. So, it is difficult to cope with uncertainties in outdoor environments and indoor heating load. Hence, this study formulates the MBS control problem as a dynamic Markov decision process and applies a deep clustering of reinforcement learning approach to obtain the optimal control policy through interaction with the environment based on multi-agent learning according to bang-bang action. With such an approach, adopting a new boiler sequencing control (BSC) strategy using deep clustering of reinforcement learning based on a bang-bang (DCRLBB) manner. The deep clustering is configured to break Lagrangian trajectory curves into piecewise segments to represent the RL agent's action policy. The agent's action policy signals are configured from the bang-bang reward formula based on trade-off implications to be more adjustable than traditional fixed parameters such as fuzzy bang-bang controller (FBBC). The agent of BSC significantly affects the energy performance of the MBS, whereas the other agent resizes boiler capacity by acting to adjust the boiler solenoid fuel valve. The comparison of results between the proposed strategy and conventional FBBC shows distinct differences in the superior response of DCRLBB under dynamic indoor/outdoor actual conditions and energy saving by more than 32% while maintaining the indoor thermal in the comfortable range.",
