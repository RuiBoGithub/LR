With the increase in the energy consumption of air-conditioning (AC) systems in Chinese residential buildings, the realization of energy savings in AC systems has attracted increasing attention. The variable refrigerant flow (VRF) system is a common AC system for residential buildings in China. In most previous studies on VRF systems, onsite measurements or surveys were conducted to collect operational data. These traditional methods may face various data issues, such as limited sample sizes and invalid data, making them unable to capture the spatial and temporal performance features of VRF systems in residential buildings on a large scale. To fill this gap, with advances in data storage and transmission technology, Big Data methods have been widely used for data collection. In the present study, researchers adopted 16,985 sets of VRF system operation data from China as the database and conducted data analysis for both the spatial and temporal dimensions. Several key indicators were proposed from the two perspectives (spatial and temporal), including the part-space index (PSI), load ratio (LR), use duration (UD), and cooling energy consumption. The main findings were as follows: (1) The \u201cpart-time part-space\u201d operation mode of residential VRF systems can be analyzed according to the statistical results of the UD and PSI. (2) An LR of <30% is the main operating condition for VRF systems in residential buildings. (3) Extracted typical LR patterns can reflect different user behavior. The statistical results obtained in this study provide a basis for VRF engineering projects.

With the rapid increase in residential air conditioner ownership, the cooling energy consumption of the residential building sector in cities has increased approximately 10 times from 2000 to 2017 [1]. Considering the recent proposal of reducing energy consumption and carbon emissions [2], a reduction in cooling energy use in the residential building sector is urgently needed [3]. To reduce the energy consumption in the cooling industry, many scholars have focused on applying innovative cooling technologies to existed systems [4,5], retrofits of cooling systems [6], accurate simulation of cooling demands [7], system control optimization [8], passive cooling technologies [9] and studies to guide and revise energy efficiency standards related to air-conditioning (AC) systems [10\u201312]. Previous studies typically involved numerical analysis [13], simulations [14,15] or laboratory tests [16] to acquire the performance of AC systems. However, research has indicated that the real performance of AC can deviate significantly from the rated performance in the laboratory [17] and the actual operating conditions typically differ from the test conditions specified in the standards [18]. Therefore, the actual operational performance of AC systems must be investigated. For capturing the actual operation of AC systems, there are two conventional data-collection methods: field studies based on sensors and survey-based studies involving questionnaires. Regarding field studies, Li et al. [19] examined 25 residential apartments in Beijing in 2006 and found that within the same building, the cooling electricity consumption exhibited large discrepancies (ranging from 0 to 15 kWh/m2) among different households. Jian et al. [20] investigated 42 air-conditioned residential units in Beijing and found that air conditioners were used intermittently and that most occupants did not start using AC until the indoor air temperature reached 29 °C. The research of de Dear unveils that the average indoor temperature triggering users to open AC is 27.9 °C in Sydney based on 42 Australian homes [21,22]. Debnath et al. [23] monitored the AC energy consumption data of 18 households to analyze the occupant cooling behavior. An et al. [24] conducted field studies in approximately 324 households by installing energy metering systems to collect AC usage data and analyzed the distributions of the AC use intensity, average cooling demand, etc. Wang et al. [25] investigated 104 room air conditioners (RACs) in 13 hotels and analyzed their use durations (UDs) and AC on/off behaviors. Yang et al. [26] conducted field tests in six residential rooms in the Yangtze River Region of China to investigate the performance of RACs and found that the annual performance factors (APF) were distributed between 2.38 and 3.82. Similarly, Xiao et al. [27] tested 13 RACs and five variable refrigerant flow (VRF) systems with a in-depth analysis of the APFs and load ratios (LRs). In field studies, sensors [28] are typically used to acquire time-series monitoring data, which is advantageous in tracking the actual performance of household AC systems However, field studies are usually time-consuming and limited by small sample sizes. Regarding survey-based studies, Chen et al. [29] conducted questionnaires in 474 university students' dormitories to understand their AC use behavior\u2014particularly the relationship between the AC usage probability and the outdoor temperature. To acquire general knowledge of Chinese building energy use, Hu et al. [3] collected 4964 questionnaires from urban households. In this study, seven AC use patterns were extracted, among which \u201cturn on when extremely warm, turn off when leaving room\u201d was the most common pattern. Ramos et al. [30] conducted a questionnaire survey in Brazil and obtained 3259 valid answers reflecting participants' AC preferences and adaptive behavior. Toosty et al. [31] adopted an online platform to disperse questionnaires to investigate the behavior changes in AC usage during COVID-19 period in Malaysia. Moreover, Ali et al. [32] adopted a survey catalog method to analyze the actual energy efficiency of room air-conditioners in Pakistan. Yang et al. [26] administered questionnaires via the Internet to collect respondents' real experiences under heating and cooling conditions. According to the 535 valid results, the researchers analyzed participants' preferences with regard to the AC UD, set-point temperatures, etc. Feng et al. [33] conducted a survey-based study in which typical occupant AC behavior patterns were clustered on the basis of 1426 questionnaires. As indicated by the foregoing studies, surveys can reveal the characteristics and motivations of occupants\u2019 AC use modes; however, this method faces data issues such as occupant misinterpretation or misunderstanding [34,35], along with privacy concerns [36]. Considering the limitations of the aforementioned data-collection methods, researchers have recently investigated Big Data for gathering onsite AC operation data. Owing to the rapid development of data storage and transmission, Big Data in building sector can be obtained to enrich the existing knowledge regarding the energy performance of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems [37,38]. Big Data usually cover a large temporal and spatial scale and are high-quality [39]. Thus, in recent years, scholars have used Big Data to investigate the actual AC performance and proposed various indicators to reflect the actual AC operation. Qian et al. [40] collected 287,000 VRF system data across China and utilized three indicators\u2014the UD, LR, and ideal coefficient of performance (ICOP) \u2014for analyzing the actual operating conditions of VRF systems. Yan et al. [41] acquired daily monitoring data of 1287 RACs in Chongqing and performed a clustering analysis to identify five typical temperature-setting behavior patterns for bedrooms and six patterns for living rooms. Anam et al. [42] used meter data of air conditioners in 9900 households connected to a smart grid, and k-means clustering was performed to obtain several typical AC energy consumption daily curves. Kai et al. [43] adopted a machine-learning algorithm to predict the cooling energy consumption of RACs according to operation data for approximately 2000 RACs from 2016 to 2017. Big Data have recently been widely applied in the building profession [44], e.g., for occupant behavior modeling [45], HVAC system optimization [46,47], and building performance evaluation [48]. Therefore, Big Data has gradually become a popular data-collection method to buildings [49], and various indicators have been proposed to evaluate the actual AC performance. Table 1 presents the characteristics of the reviewed studies from three primary perspectives: the data-collection method, collected sample size, and AC operational performance indicators. Big Data have the advantage of obtaining large samples noninvasively, which is suitable for acquiring a comprehensive understanding of the actual AC performance throughout China. Moreover, indicators that reflect the operation modes and energy performance of AC have been proposed. Despite that previous studies have put forward indicators to evaluate actual AC performance based on VRF Big Data [50], the dataset in existed study is punch data not time series, which could not reflect the spatial and temporal regularities of operation modes, energy consumption, etc. Therefore, in the present study, Big Data of 16,985 VRF systems from residential buildings in 31 provinces in China were collected and this dataset contains time-series recordings, which is more informative and useful. Based on the Big Data, in order to investigate the actual operation and performance of VRF systems, multiple indicators, including the part-space index (PSI) and LR, were proposed in the spatial dimension analysis, and other indicators, such as the UD, cooling demand, and cooling energy consumption, were analyzed from the temporal dimension. The contributions of this study are mainly focusing on the statistical analysis of VRF actual performances based on a new data source and put forward several novel indicators to reflect the VRF operation modes from a comprehensive perspective. The analyzed results can be applied in future engineering projects, such as VRF capacity design and energy efficiency standards revision, providing a reliable data foundation as references for future studies. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a description of the original 16,985-VRF system dataset for China, describes the Big Data processing procedures, and proposes multiple key performance indicators (KPIs) for analyzing the VRF performance. Section 3 presents the results based on the proposed indicators for the spatial and temporal dimensions. Section 4 discusses potential applications of the results. Section 5 presents a comparison with previous studies and discusses the limitations of this study. Finally, Section 6 presents the conclusions. 2 Material and methods This paper consists of four main parts: 1) data source description, 2) data processing, 3) data analysis, and 4) a discussion of potential applications and VRF Big Data. In the data source description part, information about the VRF system samples is presented, such as the location distribution, outdoor unit (OU) capacity, and indoor unit (IDU) number. The data processing part presents several approaches for resolving data issues with the original Big Data. Subsequently, in the data analysis part, essential KPIs for evaluating the actual performance of VRF systems are proposed. Finally, according to the proposed indicators and analysis results, several potential applications are presented, along with discussions. The overall framework of the study is illustrated in Fig. 1 . 2.1 Data source The VRF dataset contained the operation data of the VRF systems monitored with regard to three subparts: OUs, IDUs, and electric power. In addition to the monitoring data, basic information of these VRF systems, including the city, climate zone, cooling capacity, and unit type, was collected. A total of 16,985 VRF system operation data points of residential buildings in China were collected minutely for this dataset. Yet, the specific house type of residential buildings are not included. The number of VRF systems in different thermal climate zones in China [51], including severe cold zone (Severe Cold), cold zone (Cold), hot summer and cold winter zone (HSCW), hot summer and warm winter zone (HSWW), and mild zone (Mild), is presented in Fig. 2 . The Chinese climate zone division can be generally mapped to ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 169\u20132013 [52,53] is illustrated in Table 2 . As shown in Fig. 2, most (79.82%) VRF systems were applied in the HSCW zone, followed by the Cold zone. The Mild zone had the smallest number of VRF systems. The imbalanced distribution might impact the data validity of five climate zones. Commonly, the larger sample size is, the more valid results can be inferred, but more difficult to obtain. Therefore, the following statistical analysis in HSCW, HSWW and Cold zone is more valid while other zones might be less effective, which will be further discussed in Section 5.2. The timespan of this dataset was June 1st to September 30th, 2020, which covered the cooling season.. The machine type of VRF systems are contained in the original data, thus depicting the distribution of OU capacity of these VRF systems in Fig. 3 (a). For residential buildings, most of the VRF systems had capacities of <20 kW. The distribution of the number of IDUs is presented in Fig. 3(b), indicating that most of the VRF systems were equipped with four IDUs and that most households had fewer than six IDUs. 2.2 Data processing To ensure the reliability and operability of VRF Big Data, data processing is required, which primarily consists of two steps: data cleaning and data reduction. Data cleaning [54] refers to the processing of outliers and missing values. In the present study, the physical ranges of the parameters and record time were used to identify outliers. If the collected data exceeded the specified parameter range provided by the manufacturer, the value was identified as an outlier and was revised to the nearest record. Moreover, if multiple records were transmitted back simultaneously, the first record was retained, and the others (considered as outliers) were dropped. For missing values, different filling methods were adopted for the OU, IDU, and electrical-power data. With regard to the OU and IDU data, most of the parameters were zero-order variables. Therefore, the \u201cfilling forward\u201d method was adopted. Considering that the original data-collection interval was 1 min, the previous record was used to pad the missing values only when the missing data interval was ≤30 min. If the missing time period was longer than 30 min, it was identified as shutdown time, and no padding data were applied. Additionally, considering that the electrical-power data had a linear relationship with the compressor operating frequency, the electric power was a first-order parameter. Thus, for each missing value, the linear interpolation method was adopted by calculating the ratio of continuous electric power to the compressor frequency before and after the missing value and interpolating linearly. Data reduction aims to minimize redundant data items on the premise of ensuring that the dataset is applicable for specific analysis goals, so that the VRF Big Data are more convenient to read and manipulate. According to the KPIs of the proposed VRF systems (Section 2.3), unnecessary data items were eliminated in this step, and only items necessary for calculating the proposed indicators were retained, to reduce the size of the dataset. The remaining parameters are presented in Table 3 . 2.3 Data analysis To evaluate the actual operational performance of VRF systems with regard to both the spatial and temporal dimensions, various KPIs are used and analyzed. For the temporal viewpoint, the UD is proposed as an indicator of the temporal operation of VRF systems. It was calculated as the total operating time [50] in the cooling season, as follows: (1) U D = ∫ 0 T t o t a l f ( τ ) d τ , where τ represents time (min), n represents the total number of spaces in one VRF system, and T t o t a l represents the total duration of the cooling season (min). The integrand function f ( τ ) is given by Equation (2), where O p e ( i , τ ) is given by Equation (3) and i here represents the No. of the space. The VRF system is considered to be in use when at least one IDU is operating. (2) f ( τ ) = { 1 , i f ∑ i = 1 n O p e ( i , τ ) ) ≥ 1 0 , i f ∑ i = 1 n O p e ( i , τ ) ) = 0 (3) O p e ( i , τ ) = { 1 , i f I D U o f s p a c e i i s o p e r a t i n g a t t i m e τ 0 , i f I D U o f s p a c e i i s n o t o p e r a t i n g a t t i m e τ The cooling demand and cooling energy consumption and their relationships with the UD were investigated. Cooling energy consumption is the most important indicator for evaluating the energy-saving potential of VRF systems and is calculated by summing the monitored electrical-power data. The cooling demand reflects the actual cooling demand of a user. However, it is an indirectly measured parameter, and many scholars have endeavored to establish computational models for determining the actual cooling demands of VRF systems using directly acquired monitoring data parameters. Most existing methods calculate the cooling demand by multiplying the refrigerant flow rate and the specific enthalpy difference, and scholars have developed several methods for determining the actual refrigerant flow rates of VRF systems, such as the compressor set energy conservation method [17] a method based on the characteristic curve of the compressor mass flow rate [55]. In the present study, a compressor volumetric efficiency-based approach [56] was used to calculate the refrigerant flow rate. Using the monitoring data of the refrigerant temperature and pressure, the enthalpy difference between the evaporation and condensation sides was calculated using Equation (4). Additionally, the mass flow rate of the refrigerant was computed using the monitored compressor operation frequency, theoretical air volume of the compressor, and fitted volumetric efficiency, in accordance with Equation (5). Finally, the time-series actual cooling demand was obtained as the product of the calculated refrigerant mass flow rate and enthalpy difference, as indicated by Equation (6). (4) Δ h = h 3 ( T 3 , P 3 ) − h 1 ( T 1 , P 1 ) Here, Δ h represents the enthalpy difference between evaporation and condensation (kJ/kg); h ( T 3 , P 3 ) represents the enthalpy of the condenser outlet in the refrigeration cycle (kJ/kg), which is related to the condenser outlet temperature ( T 3 ) and condensing pressure ( P 3 ); and h ( T 1 , P 1 ) represents the inlet enthalpy of the refrigeration cycle (kJ/kg), which can be calculated using the condenser inlet temperature ( T 1 ) and evaporating pressure ( P 1 ). (5) m r = f × ρ c , i n × V × η v here, m r represents the refrigerant mass flow rate (kg/s), f represents the compressor operating frequency (Hz), ρ c , i n represents the suction density ( kg / m 3 ), V represents the theoretical gas volume of the compressor ( m 3 ), and η v represents the volumetric efficiency of the compressor. (6) Q c = m r × Δ h here, Q c represents the calculated cooling demand. m r and Δ h have the same meanings as in the above equations. From a spatial perspective, the PSI is proposed as the KPI to depict the \u201cpart-space\u201d user mode of the VRF system for one household. Hence, the definition of PSI depends on the different numbers of IDUs being used simultaneously, such as the UDs of only one IDU operating and two IDUs operating simultaneously, as shown in Equation (7). According to the calculation of the PSI, the LR is defined (similar to the power load ratio in previous studies [57]) to reflect the real operating conditions of VRF systems. It is calculated using Equation (9). (7) P S I ( k ) = ∫ 0 T t o t a l g ( τ | k ) d τ (8) g ( τ | k ) = { 1 , i f ∑ i = 1 n p e ( i , τ ) ) = k 0 , i f ∑ i = 1 n O p e ( i , τ ) ) = 0 here, PSI(k) represents the UD of k IDUs operating simultaneously. T t o t a l represents the total duration of the cooling season. g ( τ | k ) is given by Equation (8), which indicates that the moment is only counted when the number of operating IDUs is k. (9) L R = Q c Q r a t e d here, Q c represents the actual cooling demand, and Q r a t e d represents the rated cooling capacity of the VRF system. With the proposed KPIs for analyzing the actual operation and performance of VRF systems from a temporal perspective, the distributions of the UD among different districts and different outdoor temperatures were examined. Furthermore, the distributions of the cooling demand and energy consumption were investigated to identify the relationships among these KPIs. For the spatial dimension, the PSI results were analyzed for several specific households and all households, and the corresponding LR results were obtained. Moreover, k-means clustering [58] was performed to categorize several typical LR patterns for characterizing the current operating conditions of VRF systems in China. 3 Results and analysis 3.1 Temporal dimension The UDs of all the VRF systems were calculated according to the dataset. Provinces with <30 samples were eliminated from the distribution map because the sample size did not satisfy the minimum requirement for statistical analysis [59]. As shown in Fig. 4 (a), the average cooling UD exhibited an increasing trend from the northern district to the southern district in China. The average cooling UD was calculated according to the division of the five climate zones, as shown in Fig. 4(b). The average cooling UD of the VRF systems in the Severe Cold zone was 656 h, which was the shortest among the zones and only accounted for 22% of the entire cooling season from June to September. Conversely, the average cooling UD was the longest in the HSWW zone (1074 h, accounting for 35% of the cooling season, i.e., 1.6 times that in the Severe Cold zone). From the average results for the different climate zones, it can be inferred that most VRF systems in China are only used for part of the season, reflecting the \u201cpart-time\u201d operation mode of residential users. Considering that the cooling demand and cooling energy consumption are closely related to the UD [60], these two indicators were analyzed. Similar to the foregoing analysis, provinces with sample sizes of <30 were eliminated from the country-wide distribution. The accumulative cooling demand of each VRF system in the total season was calculated using the compressor volumetric efficiency method. The average accumulative cooling demand for different provinces in China is shown in Fig. 5 (a); an increasing trend was observed from north to south, similar to the cooling UD. According to the cooling demand results of the five climate zones in Fig. 5(b), the VRF systems in the Severe Cold zone had the smallest average accumulative cooling demand (11.43 kWh/m2), whereas those in the HSWW zone had the largest average accumulative cooling demand (37.24 kWh/m2). As shown in Fig. 6 (a), the trend of the average energy consumption was consistent with those of the cooling demand and UD. As indicated by Fig. 6(b), the VRF systems in the Severe Cold zone consumed the least energy, and those in the HSWW zone consumed the most energy. From a more detailed analysis, UDs of VRF systems at different outdoor temperatures were further calculated to investigate the primary outdoor conditions for VRF system operation. Fig. 7 presents the distributions of the cooling UD at different outdoor temperatures for the five climate zones. Considering the limited sample size of Severe Cold and Mild zones, the analysis results are not quite valid as other zones while the UD at different outdoor temperatures in HCSW, HSWW and Cold zones are convincing and different from each other. As shown in Fig. 7, the cooling UD reached its peak value around 28 °C in the Severe Cold, Cold, and Mild zones, whereas in the HSCW and HSWW zones, the peak UD occurred at 30 °C. Additionally, the UDs of the VRF systems at temperatures ranging from 20 to 24 °C were higher in the Severe Cold, Cold, and Mild zones, which might be resulted from that lower temperatures occur more often in the three climate zones than in HSCW and HSWW zone. Furthermore, from the distributions of boxplots, it is obvious that users in HSWW zone demonstrate more obvious deviation among each other with some users using AC almost for the whole time. While for users in Mild climate zone, the UD of VRF systems is saliently reduced and distributes more concentrate, which reflecting the users\u2019 operation of VRF at different temperatures are more similar and do not usually open household VRF in summer. 3.2 Spatial dimension The PSI is proposed to reflect user behavior in one household from a spatial perspective. To name these samples, the projects are numbered according to their UD and among these samples, No. 8500 to No. 8503 four VRF samples with same UD in the cooling season were selected for a detailed analysis as shown in Fig. 8 . . Even when the VRF systems were operated for the same length of time, the PSIs differed significantly; PSI(1) accounted for the major proportion of the study period for projects No.8500, 8501, and 8502. For all four users, PSI(1) and PSI(2) were dominant. Therefore, it can be inferred that although different users had distinct use modes, the main operating conditions for users involved only one or two IDUs under operation. Furthermore, in Fig. 9 , the PSI results for all the VRF systems are shown individually. PSI(1) accounted for most of the time. Furthermore, to illustrate the general phenomenon, Fig. 10 presents the summed PSI results for all the systems. As shown, for 51% of the total UD, only one IDU was operated, and two IDUs were operated simultaneously, accounting for 28% of the total UD, PSI(≥5) accounted for 3% of the total time. According to the foregoing results, households usually preferred to use some of the IDUs to satisfy their cooling demand, reflecting a \u201cpart-space\u201d operation mode. According to the PSI results, IDUs were often operated partially rather than fully, which might result in partial-load conditions. At the VRF system selection phase, householders usually select the rated capacity by judging the house area and estimated unit area cooling demand. Yet, when we analyzed the actual LR of VRF systems, many low LR conditions were discovered in all climates in China. Fig. 11 presents the distribution of the operation time for all the VRF systems at different LR intervals. Clearly, the main operating condition of the VRF systems was <30% LR, accounting for 77.1% of the total time, which confirmed the \u201cpart-space\u201d use mode in which most dwellers only activated 1 or 2 IDUs of the VRF systems most of the time. In contrast, the LR intervals of 80%\u2013100% only accounted for 2.1% of the total time, indicating that the actual operation condition of VRF systems can hardly reach high LRs. Moreover, the distribution of the operating time among the LR intervals in different climate zones was analyzed. As shown in Fig. 12 , operation at the LR intervals of 0%\u201330% accounted for 81.4%, 81.5%, 80.8%, 78.4%, and 61.7% of the total time in the Severe Cold, Cold, Mild, HSCW, and HSWW zones, respectively. For the LR intervals of 50%\u2013100%, the proportion of the total time in the HSWW zone (reaching 19.9%) was significantly larger than those in the other zones (<10%). These results indicate salient differences in the LR among the climate zones. To further investigate the operating conditions of VRF systems, a clustering analysis was conducted to derive the typical LR patterns for each climate zone. K-means clustering [58] was performed to categorize the LRs of the systems into several representative patterns, which is a widely adopted approach for identifying several clusters when the labels are unknown. The Silhouette Coefficient (SC) [61] was used to determine the optimal number of clusters. The clustering results for the five climate zones are presented in Fig. 13 . For the Severe Cold, Cold, and Mild zones, it was optimal to generate two clusters according to the SC index, and a common phenomenon was observed among these three zones: Cluster 2 (accounting for nearly 80% of the samples) belonged to a category with shorter cooling hours at each LR interval, with VRF systems only opened for cooling for approximately 500 h in the entire cooling season comparing with Cluster 1. Cluster 1 (the other 20% of the VRF systems) was characterized by longer operation hours (approximately 1700 h in the cooling season), with the peak UD occurring at the LR interval of 10%\u201320%. Moreover, for both the short-time users (Cluster 2) and the long-time users (Cluster 1) in the three climate zones, the VRF systems were mainly operated at LRs of <30%. For the HSCW and HSWW zones, the most appropriate cluster numbers were three and four, respectively. As shown in Fig. 13(c), Cluster 1 (27%) and Cluster 2 (69%) for the HSCW zone exhibited similar LR distributions to Clusters 1 and 2 for the Severe Cold, Cold, and Mild zones. Moreover, Cluster 3 (4%) for the HSCW zone represented a different group of users with a significantly longer operating time (>1200 h) at 0%\u201310% LR and relatively short operating times at the other LR intervals. As shown in Fig. 13(d), there were four categories of LRs for the HSWW zone, and the distribution features of Cluster 1 (61%), Cluster 2 (21%), and Cluster 4 (3%) were similar to those of the three clusters for the HSCW zone. However, for the HSWW zone, Cluster 3 was a distinct category in which the UDs of the VRF systems at LR intervals of 20%\u201360% were longer than those for the other categories. Thus, for the HSWW zone, Cluster 3 represented a group of households that used the VRF systems at relatively high LRs. Above all, it unveils that VRF systems mainly operate at low LR ranges for different length of time and one specific type of LR pattern in HSWW zone demonstrates higher LR ranges. These statistical results can be an inspiration for VRF system design optimization, especially rated capacity of OU, so as to reduce the equipment cost and meanwhile raise the actual LR. An example of application in OU capacity optimization is introduced in Section 4.2. 4 Potential applications of VRF Big Data Installation of VRF systems has become widespread in China. Owing to the high flexibility with regard to controlling IDUs for users, VRF systems have been installed in many residential buildings. According to the analysis results for the residential VRF system operation dataset, several potential applications were investigated. 4.1 Application in standards revision The current standards for VRF performance in China, i.e., GB/T 18837-2015, were investigated [62]. The energy-efficiency indices of VRF systems defined in this standard include the APF, seasonal energy efficiency ratio (SEER), and heating seasonal performance factor (HSPF). SEER is defined based on the cooling-season total load (CSTL) and cooling-season total electricity consumption as defined in the standard, which is further analyzed in this study. The calculation of CSTL is given by Equation (10). In Equation (10), an index representing the UDs of the VRF systems at different outdoor temperatures ( n j ) is defined to reflect the use modes, which can be calculated according to the VRF dataset obtained in this study. (10) C S T L = ∑ j = 1 m B L c ( t j ) × n j + ∑ j = m + 1 19 φ f u l ( t j ) × n j here, B L c ( t j ) represents the cooling demand of the building when the outdoor temperature is t j . j is the outdoor temperature interval number defined in GB/T 17758-2010 [63]. m is the No. of outdoor temperature intervals from 22 °C to 35 °C. φ f u l ( t j ) represents the cooling capacity when the VRF system operates at the nominal cooling capacity. n j represents the cooling UDs at different outdoor temperature intervals. According to the foregoing statistical method and results, the average UD for VRF systems in Beijing at different outdoor temperatures ranging from 22 to 39 °C was examined to identify the differences between the actual performance of VRF systems and the reference values provided by GB/T 17758-2010. Fig. 14 shows the deviations between the statistical results and the standards for both the average and peak values. Within the temperature range of 22\u201334 °C, the UD based on the VRF dataset was significantly shorter than the values from the standards, whereas the UD at 36\u201339 °C exceeded the reference values. Such deviations imply that the actual use mode of VRF systems can differ significantly from the assumed mode in the standards and that the large-scale operation dataset of VRF systems obtained in this study is a reliable database for future standard revisions. 4.2 Application in capacity design optimization of VRF systems According to the derived typical LR patterns, potential suggestions for capacity design optimization are proposed. It can be noticed that in most climate zones (with the exception of the HSWW zone), the categorized LR patterns were mainly concentrated at low LRs for most of the operating time, and the UD at the full load was nearly zero, implying that the VRF OU capacity can be reduced to an appropriate extent. In this section, a VRF system with 4 IDUs is specifically selected and analyzed to explore the potential of OU capacity optimization. This example system is selected located in HSCW zone. To explore the possible reduced OU capacity, two indexes are defined: Combination ratio (CR) is illustrated as Equation (11), designing the relationship between rated OU capacity and IDU capacity. Unsatisfied rate (UR) is defined in Equation (12). A performance curve reflecting coefficient of performance (COP) with LR are defined according to laboratory test data, shown in Fig. 15 . Based on the two indexes and COP curve, cooling energy consumption and unsatisfied rates can be calculated for the VRF system. (11) C R = ∑ i = 1 n R C ( I D U i ) R C ( O U ) where CR means combination ratio, RC ( IDU i ) represents the rated capacity of No. i IDU (kW), and RC(OU) is the rated capacity of OU(kW). (12) U R = ∫ 0 T t o t a l h ( τ ) d τ , ∫ 0 T t o t a l d τ , where UR means unsatisfied rate, T total represents the total duration of the cooling season (min) as mentioned above, and h ( τ ) is shown in Equation (12). (13) h ( τ ) = { 1 , i f C L ( τ ) > R C ( O U ) , i f C L ( τ ) > R C ( O U ) where CL ( τ ) means the cooling demand of building at time τ (min) and RC(OU) is the same as Equation (11). In this case, we set CR as 1.0, 1.2 and 1.5 to investigate the UR and potential of cooling energy savings compared to CR of 1.0. The calculated results are demonstrated as Table 4 . It can be noticed that with the increase of CR, i.e. reducing the OU capacity, the electricity consumption will decrease due to the increasing LR with higher COP. Yet, the higher CR leads to higher UR. From the above case, it is concluded that considering the low LR patterns of VRF actual performance, there is great potential in optimizing the design of VRF system capacity. When optimizing the capacity, it is recommended to consider both UR and costs to decide a most balanced point for the optimization. 5 Discussion 5.1 Validation based on previous studies According to a large-scale VRF dataset, multiple indicators were analyzed to evaluate the actual performance of the VRF systems. However, only a single data source was adopted, so the obtained statistical results could not be validated. Therefore, validations with previous studies were performed to confirm the reliability of the results. The study conducted by Qian et al. [40] was adopted for comparison. They used punch data of 287,000 VRF systems in China [40]. The results of the two studies were compared with regard to the typical LR cooling patterns. In both studies, k-means clustering was performed to acquire the typical load patterns for cooling. Similar load patterns were obtained for the Cold, HSCW, HSWW, and Mild zones, where partial loads were the primary operating conditions. Additionally, in both studies, it was found that approximately 15% of the VRF systems operated at relatively high LRs in the HSWW zone. However, for the Severe Cold zone, two clusters in which the VRF systems operated at full loads were obtained in previous studies, whereas no such clusters were obtained in the present study. This discrepancy may be due to differences in the datasets and different sample numbers for the Severe Cold zone. Overall, the results of the present study for the typical LR patterns are consistent with those of previous studies; additionally, the results in this study are more detailed and multidimensional owing to the use of VRF Big Data. 5.2 Limitations of present work This study represents a preliminary attempt at the application of Big Data in the field of VRF systems in China. The dataset contained time-series operation data of 16,985 VRF systems from June to September 2020. Various KPIs were proposed for evaluating the VRF performance during the cooling season. However, limitations for some indirectly measured parameters cooling demand could not be avoided, particularly the cooling demand calculation. In this study, a compressor volumetric efficiency-based approach was adopted to calculate the cooling demand. Although this calculation method has been experimentally validated in previous studies [56], it must be validated for actual VRF operation data. Furthermore, with the development of sub-metering and data science, data from different types of buildings can be acquired, whereas this study primarily focused on the cooling conditions of VRF systems in residential buildings. The sample numbers in different districts are also unbalanced. Therefore, further data collection work and in-depth analyses of other building types and heating conditions can be performed to obtain comprehensive knowledge of the operation and performance of VRF systems across China, which will be helpful for increasing the energy efficiency of VRF systems. 6 Conclusion Statistical and clustering analyses based on a large-scale VRF system operational dataset of residential buildings in China were conducted. Essential KPIs were defined to evaluate the actual operating conditions and performance of the VRF systems, including the UD, cooling demand, cooling energy consumption, PSI, and LR. The distributions of different KPIs in various climate zones were derived, and the typical LR patterns of the VRF systems in all the climate zones were categorized according to the dataset. The main findings are as follows: \u2022 For the temporal dimension, the UD exhibited an increasing trend from north to south (in China), as well as strong positive correlations with the cooling demand and cooling energy consumption of the VRF systems. The UD also reflected the \u201cpart-time\u201d use mode. \u2022 The average cooling demands during the cooling season in 2020 were in the range of 11.43\u201337.24 kWh/m2, and the mean cooling energy consumption was distributed from 3.62 to 12.01 kWh/m2 across all the climate zones. \u2022 For the spatial dimension, it was found that only one IDU operated for 51% of the total use time, and two IDUs operated simultaneously for 27% of the total use time, indicating that the simultaneous IDU usage rate was low. This led to low LRs as the main operating conditions for the VRF systems. \u2022 Typical LR patterns were identified via clustering analysis. Two patterns representing short- and long-time users were extracted for the Severe Cold, Cold, and Mild climate zones. Three patterns (clusters) were obtained for the HSCW zone, with the addition of a group of users who employed VRF systems at 0%\u201310% LR for >1200 h. Four patterns were obtained for the HSWW zone, with the addition of a group of users who employed VRF systems under high-LR conditions. From the statistical results based on the large-scale VRF dataset applied in this study, it can be concluded that compared with traditional onsite and questionnaire survey methods, the multi-online application of Big Data allows the collection of data samples with larger time and space scales and stable data quality, and more comprehensive results can be obtained through statistical analysis. The statistical results of this study provide reference data for future practical projects. Author statement Hua Liu: investigation and resources.

        "dc:description": "With the increase in the energy consumption of air-conditioning (AC) systems in Chinese residential buildings, the realization of energy savings in AC systems has attracted increasing attention. The variable refrigerant flow (VRF) system is a common AC system for residential buildings in China. In most previous studies on VRF systems, onsite measurements or surveys were conducted to collect operational data. These traditional methods may face various data issues, such as limited sample sizes and invalid data, making them unable to capture the spatial and temporal performance features of VRF systems in residential buildings on a large scale. To fill this gap, with advances in data storage and transmission technology, Big Data methods have been widely used for data collection. In the present study, researchers adopted 16,985 sets of VRF system operation data from China as the database and conducted data analysis for both the spatial and temporal dimensions. Several key indicators were proposed from the two perspectives (spatial and temporal), including the part-space index (PSI), load ratio (LR), use duration (UD), and cooling energy consumption. The main findings were as follows: (1) The \u201cpart-time part-space\u201d operation mode of residential VRF systems can be analyzed according to the statistical results of the UD and PSI. (2) An LR of <30% is the main operating condition for VRF systems in residential buildings. (3) Extracted typical LR patterns can reflect different user behavior. The statistical results obtained in this study provide a basis for VRF engineering projects.",
