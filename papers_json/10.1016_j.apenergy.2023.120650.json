Department of Building Environment and Energy Engineering The Hong Kong Polytechnic University Kowloon Hong Kong Air-conditioning systems in commercial buildings are usually switched on in advance to precool the indoor spaces to create an acceptable working environment upon the office hour. However, the central cooling systems often fail to provide enough cooling supply capacity due to the high cooling demand at the morning start period especially in hot seasons. In this situation, the imbalanced cooling distribution in the air-conditioning systems often results in large difference of cooling-down speed among different building zones, so that the precooling time has to be extended, leading to significant energy waste. This study proposes a new iterative learning control strategy to properly manage the cooling distribution (i.e., water valve openings of air-handling units) for achieving uniform cooling (i.e., synchronously reaching the indoor dry-blub temperature setpoint) among building zones during the morning start period. A reinforcement learning method (Q-learning) is adopted for the control parameter setting of the developed iterative learning controller. Validation tests are conducted and results show that the proposed control strategy could reduce the daily precooling time up to 12.1% during typical days in Hong Kong by achieving uniform cooling. The daily energy consumption could be reduced between 5.1% and 17.8% by shortening morning start period, corresponding a weekly electrical energy saving between 1,376 kWh and 2,916 kWh in the test building.

Improving the energy efficiency of buildings has become an urgent challenge. It is therefore necessary to monitor, control and manage the energy-consumers in buildings, such as the heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems [3]. Besides, the buildings tend to have high electricity demand and it will cause significant peak load especially for commercial buildings, then concerns arise from both the electricity suppliers and customers due to the capacity and financial issues [4]. Therefore, reducing or limiting the building peak demand is essential and beneficial. On one hand, it could relieve the capacity stress of a power grid considering power generation. On the other hand, the energy consumers could reduce the electricity bill when the electrical peak demand is a charge factor, such as in Hong Kong. In Hong Kong, the electricity bills consist of the charge for the monthly electrical peak demand (kVA) and the charge for the monthly electricity consumption (kWh) [5]. The air-conditioning system is one of the highest energy-consumers in buildings, accounts for around 1/3 of the total electricity consumption in Hong Kong [2]. In this way, many control strategies have been developed for building HVAC systems to enhance the energy efficiency and reduce the peak demand. The building automation system (BAS) is a conventional and effective tool for efficient management of the building HVAC systems and the control functions can be divided into local control functions and supervisory control functions [6]. By using building automation systems, the control strategies developed can be applied in real buildings. For local control functions, one of the most commonly-used control strategies is the demand-based feedback control, where the PID (proportion-integration-differentiation) control is commonly used [5]. With the local PID control, a building zone can maintain the indoor temperature setpoint by controlling the terminal units such as the air handling units (AHUs) to modulate the cooling intake from central cooling systems when the cooling supply is enough. The demand-based feedback control with the PID controllers is a mature technology, it can track the control setpoint with acceptable accuracy, adaptiveness and simplicity, so it is widely used in building\u2019s local control functions and the research in PID control has never ceased [5,7]. For the supervisory control, also known as optimal control, it aims at choosing the best local control setpoints to minimize or maximize an objective function, such minimizing energy consumption, operating cost etc. [6]. Many studies have been conducted in the domain of optimal control for HVAC systems [8\u201311]. With the rapid development of big data, computing resources and advanced algorithms, machine learning has been explored to improve the building control performance [12]. Reinforcement Learning (RL), as a branch of machine learning specifically for control problems, is becoming a promising method to revolutionize building controls [13]. Zhang et al. [14] proposed a control strategy based on deep reinforcement learning for a radiant heating system and the results showed that, compared with the rule-based control, the proposed control strategy could achieve 16.7% heating demand reduction with more than 95% probability. Zou et al. [15] also implemented the deep reinforcement learning algorithms for optimal control over the AHUs, they revealed that the deep reinforcement learning agents could achieve 27%\u201330% energy saving comparing to the actual energy consumption. As a popular application of AI (Artificial Intelligence), machine learning has been studied widely for enhancing the building control performance, but it is worth mentioning that the implementation of AI-assisted control strategy in real application is still an ongoing research endeavour [16], mainly due to the data-demanding and time-consuming problems of the machine learning methods. In addition, the security of on-site application of such AI-assisted control strategy (e.g. RL controller) also needs to be addressed [13]. It can be concluded that integrating advanced AI algorithms into building automation systems is promising to formulate smart control strategies for building HVAC systems to enhance the energy efficiency. Moreover, the advanced control strategies should be convenient and reliable enough for real applications. Iterative learning control (ILC) is an intelligent learning-based control method for repetitive processes. It is developed based on the notion that the performance of a system that executes the same task multiple times can be improved by learning from previous executions [17]. The idea of iterative learning control is derived from the fact that human can learn much from previous experience to avoid making mistakes. This concept was first developed in publication by Arimoto et al. [18]. They proposed an iterative betterment process to improve the operation of a mechanical robot by using the updated data from previous operation. Iterative learning control has been widely used in repetitive processes such as robotic manipulators [19] and manufacturing systems [20]. Also, there are some studies adopting this method in the HVAC control domain. Meng et al. [21] used the iterative learning control to achieve the optimal control of secondary pump differential pressure and supply air temperature in a variable air volume (VAV) air-conditioning experiment system. Minakais et al. [22] adopted the iterative learning control to improve the room temperature tracking performance over time based on the assumption that outdoor weather patterns are somewhat repetitive. The advantage of iterative learning control in applications is that no mathematical model of the controlled plant is required for the controller design. Due to the nonlinearity of building HVAC systems, the iterative learning control could make use of the advantage and bring high effectiveness. 1.2 Problems and challenges of HVAC system control under limited cooling supply For commercial buildings, their air-conditioning systems are usually switched on before the office hour in the morning, known as precooling. It is an effective and essential means for creating an acceptable indoor environment at the beginning of the office hour [5]. However, extended precooling time would cause serious energy waste, so the length of precooling time is important for enhancing the energy efficiency especially for large commercial buildings. Therefore, the effective control strategy for building air-conditioning systems to shorten the morning start period is very important. For precooling control, previous studies mainly work on predicting the time required to cool down a building from the night setback condition by applying the optimal start algorithms. Seem et al. [23] made a comparison of 57 models for estimating the return time from a night setback condition and they recommended the room air temperature and the exponentially weighted moving averages (EWMA) of the normalized heating or cooling demand should be considered as predictor variables for the optimal start algorithms. Gunay et al. [24] developed a morning start algorithm using a data-driven method. They proposed a clustering-based method by using a dataset from a large office building and their results show that the potential saving by tuning daily start times was estimated 7% for cooling. It is obvious that the building precooling at morning start period is beneficial but the extended precooling time should be avoided. The cooling demand of commercial buildings is usually very high at morning start period, the indoor temperatures of individual building zones are much higher than their corresponding setpoints, but the cooling supply from central cooling plant is usually limited and each air-conditioned zone would compete for the limited cooling supply. At this state, all the terminal units such as water valves and air dampers would be fully open under the traditional PID feedback control, the cooling-down speeds between individual zones are often largely different due to the differences between hydraulic resistances and pressure losses associated to different terminal units. This imbalanced cooling distribution would result in extended precooling time to allow all the building zones reaching their temperature setpoints at the start of the office hour. This problem is well-illustrated through on-site data collected from a super-high-rise commercial building in Hong Kong by Tang et al. [5], and they proposed an optimal control strategy for morning start period to optimize the limited cooling supply distribution among the building zones. However, there are some limitations for the implementation of the presented method in [5]. First, the existing method requires a physical water flowmeter installed for each AHU, but the flowmeters are rarely installed in individual AHUs due to the high cost for practical real applications. In addition, this existing method requires additional experiment work for the thermodynamic characteristic parameter identification of individual building zones and it requests serious effort, especially for large commercial buildings. 1.3 Objective and innovations of this research To address the above problems and challenges, this study proposes an iterative learning control strategy for building air-conditioning systems under limited cooling supply in the morning start period. This simple control strategy can determine the AHU water valve openings at morning start period to achieve uniform cooling among building zones effectively, by updating the valve opening control values of individual AHUs using the iterative learning control. A key task and challenge for implementing this iterative learning control strategy is the setting or tuning of its parameters. A reinforcement learning approach is therefore developed for the setting of the control parameters by adopting a classical reinforcement learning method, namely Q-learning. This control strategy is novel and proposed the first time for proper cooling distribution to achieve even cooling in buildings. The proposed control strategy is model-free and does not require extra sensors nor additional experiment work for thermodynamic characteristic parameter identification. Its working mechanism and means of use have some similarity with that of PID controllers, and it can be implemented conveniently. This paper will present the proposed strategy including the basic control mechanism, the operation and the parameter setting method, as well as the test and validation of the proposed strategy. 2 Proposed iterative learning control strategy This study proposes an iterative learning control strategy for building air-conditioning systems for saving energy by shortening the morning start period, which is developed on the basis of the iterative learning control [17]. The daily precooling period is regarded as a repetitive process, the basic idea is to set the AHU valve openings corresponding to the actual cooling needs of individual zones during the precooling period. In this way, the conventional (PID) feedback control is taken over temporally in this period. And the fixed AHU valve opening control values are updated in daily basis. An outline of the proposed control strategy is shown in Fig. 1 . The iterative learning controller adopts the iterative learning control strategy, and the control outputs are the AHU water valve opening control signals corresponding to individual building zones. The environmental variable measurements from the building zones are sent back to the iterative learning controller and used directly for iterative learning control. Two control performance indicators are proposed for evaluating the control performance and setting the control parameters. The Q-learning agent selects the control parameters of the iterative learning controller based on the control performance indicators. 2.1 Basic control mechanism Fig. 2 illustrates the basic principle of the proposed control strategy. For building air-conditioning systems at morning start period, the cooling demand is very high and individual air-conditioned building zones would compete for the limited cooling supply from the chillers. The iterative learning controller is proposed for the chilled water side to manage the distribution of the limited chilled water among the building zones aiming at keeping indoor temperatures of all the building zones the same (approaching the temperature setpoint at the same time). The control objects are the AHU water valve openings corresponding to individual building zones. The control outputs (valve opening control signals) are updated on daily basis before the precooling start time, and keep the same during the precooling process. The iterative learning controller needs to collect data of two categories. The first category includes the control outputs at the last control interval (i.e., last day) and the control performance indicators at the last control interval. They are used to update first term of the iterative learning control function at the current interval. The second category includes the environmental information (i.e., initial temperatures) of the building zones at the current interval, which are used to update second term of the iterative learning control function at the current interval. As the time passes, the iterative learning controller can continuously track and approach the goal of consistent precooling lead time for different building zones at the morning start period. 2.2 Control performance indicators In order to evaluate the control performance, two control performance indicators are proposed based on the notion of consistent precooling lead time for different individual building zones. The first indicator is the maximum return time among multiple zones from night setback (tmax ), as shown in Eq. (1). Where, t n represents the return time from night setback for zone n. Fig. 3 illustrates the return time from night setback for an individual building zone. The precooling starts at time tA , when the indoor air temperature is relatively high because the air-conditioning systems in commercial buildings are generally not operating during the night. The indoor air temperature of the zone then decreases and reaches the cooling setpoint at time tB . The time difference between tA and tB (i.e., t B - t A) is defined as the return time from night setback. (1) t max = m a x t 1 , t 2 ⋯ t n The goal of the proposed control strategy is to minimize the precooling lead time of building zones considering the distribution of limited cooling supply in the morning start period. In order to achieve consistent precooling lead time for different building zones, the maximum return time among all zones from night setback should be considered as a performance indicator and it represents the required precooling operation time of the chillers. The second indicator is the cooling diversity indicator (cdi), as shown in Eq. (2). (2) cdi = Δ t max t max (3) Δ t max = m a x t 1 , t 2 ⋯ t n - m i n t 1 , t 2 ⋯ t n The maximum deviation between the return time among all building zones from night setback (Δtmax ) is defined in Eq. (3), which represents the largest precooling lead time deviation among the building zones at morning start period. As the control objective is to minimize the maximum precooling lead time deviation under the limited cooling supply, the cooling diversity among the building zones should be consistent. The cooling diversity indicator defined in Eq. (2) is used as a performance indicator and the its value is expected to be as low as possible. 2.3 Operation procedure of iterative learning control strategy The schematic of the proposed control strategy is shown in Fig. 4 . The iterative learning control proposed in this study is based on the daily operation data and measurements. The objects to be controlled are the AHU water valves corresponding to the building zones served. The control strategy attempts to continuously track the goal of consistent precooling lead time for different building zones at morning start period. The control time interval (iterative step) is set to be one day. The control outputs are updated according to the daily learning results. Initialization. At the start (i.e. the first day of the control operation), in order to accelerate the initial learning process, the initial control setting (u 1) is determined based on the previous operational data. At this step, the controller collects the following data information as defined from Eq. (4) to Eq. (6) during the morning start period, (1) return time (t 1) of the n building zones from night setback, (2) temperature (T 1) of the n building zones at the precooling start time, (3) AHU valve openings of the n building zones (u 1). These data are saved every day for next day\u2019s learning control. (4) t 1 = t 1 , 1 , t 2 , 1 , ⋯ t n , 1 (5) T 1 = T 1 , 1 , T 2 , 1 , ⋯ T n , 1 (6) u 1 = u 1 , 1 , u 2 , 1 , ⋯ u n , 1 Control updating at each control interval. In the day i, before the precooling start time, the proposed control algorithm is activated. The controller collects the zone temperatures (Ti ) of building zones and execute the iterative learning control strategy as illustrated below. o Calculate the average return time (t ave) of the n building zones from night setback using Eq. (7). (7) t ave = ∑ 1 n t n , i - 1 n o Calculate the AHU valve opening correction Δun,i , for each building zone n using Eq. (8). (8) Δ u n , i = k ∙ t ave - t n , i - 1 - b ∙ T n , i - T n , i - 1 where, k and b can be recognized as the control parameters of the learning function, and they need to be adjusted according to the specific system. o Calculate the corresponding AHU valve opening un,i , for each building zone n, using Eq. (9). (9) u n , i = u n , i - 1 - Δ u n , i According to the control algorithm above, the AHU valve opening control signals of the n building zones (ui ) at day i could be determined. With time passes, the controller can handle the environmental difference every day and repeat the iterative learning control strategy to update the control outputs. 2.4 Control parameter setting using Q-learning agent As illustrated in Eq. (8), the iterative learning control function has two key parameters (k, b) as the control parameters. The values of the two parameters have significant impacts on the overall control performance. If the values of k and b are high, the learning and correction process of the control strategy would be quick, but the system may be over tuned if they are too high. On the contrary, if the values of k and b are low, the system may avoid this problem. However, the learning process would be slow. For engineering practice, such control parameters could be manually determined by experienced engineers. To make the application of the proposed control strategy convenient and labor-saving, the tasks of selecting the control parameters can be formulated and treated as a basic reinforcement learning problem. Q-learning is a classical reinforcement learning method. This method is model-free and the algorithm is based on Q-table [25]. Compared with many network-based methods such as deep reinforcement learning, the Q-learning method is easier to converge and more feasible to be applied in engineering practice [26]. The applications adopting Q-learning have been proven to be effective by many previous studies in the HVAC domain [26\u201328]. In this study, this method is adopted for control parameter setting of the iterative learning controller. The parameter identification and adjustment of the iterative learning controller is performed using an online adaptive approach with the proposed Q-learning agent, as shown in Fig. 5 . The inputs of the Q-learning agent are the control performance indicators and the outputs are the control parameters. The detailed process of the Q-learning agent workflow for control parameter setting is elaborated below. By adopting the Q-learning method, the Q-learning agent can learn the process characteristics online and update in each control interval to select appropriate control parameters for the iterative learning controller, and therefore improve the control performance. Outline of Q-learning agent: For Q-learning agent design, the Q-table method is proposed as the policy to define the Q-learning agent\u2019s way of behaving at a given time. The control parameters (k, b) of the iterative learning controller are optimized by the Q-table in the Q-learning agent. For the Q-learning agent in this study, the Q-table provides a mapping from perceived states of the building zones to control parameter setting. Table 1 is the Q-table defined in this study for the iterative learning control strategy. The action (A) in this table represents the control parameters (k, b) to be determined and the state (S) represents the calculated cooling diversity indicator (cdi) as introduced in Section 2.2. Each Q-value (e.g. Q (S1, A1)) in Table 1 is updated through the Q-learning process, and its initial value is 0. All the Q-values formulate the Q-table, which is used to determine the control parameters (k, b). The learning process of Q-learning agent using the Q-table is illustrated in the following five subsections. Action: The action is defined as the combination of the control parameters (k, b), and determining the action is the task of the Q-learning agent in this study. Discretization, as a classical and convenient method for action setting in Q-learning, is used in this study. The setting of the discretization precision for the action is flexible. Higher precision setting could make the state identification more accurate and the action selection more precise. But it would also lead to a larger Q-table and thus require longer period and more data for the operation of the Q-learning agent. In order to make it easy for application, the action (k, b) is discretized into three combinations in this study, i.e., (0.5, 0.0125), (1, 0.025), and (2, 0.5). They are determined based on the expert judgement and the authors\u2019 experience. It is reasonable for such setting because the three combinations of the control parameters could represent low, medium and high learning rate respectively for the iterative learning controller. The mission of the Q-learning agent is to determine the appropriate learning rate for the iterative learning control strategy. State: The state in this study is defined as the cooling diversity indicator (cdi), because this control performance indicator can represent the consistence between the precooling lead times of different individual building zones. It reflects the iterative learning control performance of previous day, and the Q-learning agent should select the control parameters according to the state at current morning start period. The cooling diversity indicator is a continuous variable and for the convenience of application in Q-table, which is discretized into five intervals with equal length as shown in Table 1. Reward: The reward is calculated using Eq. (10), based on the maximum return time among multiple zones (tmax ) as described in Section 2.2. It is based on the notion that our expectation is to shorten the maximum return time among all building zones. For the Q-learning agent, the reward is higher when the maximum return time among all zones is lower. (10) R = - t max Q-agent learning process: During the learning process, the Q-learning agent accumulates the experience by updating the Q-table, and the updating principle is shown in Eq. (11) [25]. (11) Q s , a ← Q s , a + α R + γ max a ' Q s ' , a ' - Q s , a where, Q (s, a) represents the Q-value with state (s) and action (a) as shown in Table 1 and the initial Q-values are set to 0. At each iterative learning control interval, the Q-value of Q (s, a) corresponding to the previous step is updated according to this principle. R is the reward calculated using Eq. (10), as the result of the action (a). α is the learning rate of the Q-learning agent and γ is the impact of the reward at next iterative learning control interval on the decision of action at current step. In this study, the α and γ are set to 0.9 and 0.1 respectively. max α ' Q s ' , a ' is the max Q-value at state (s\u2032) with current Q-table. Principle of control parameters determination: For every control interval, the Q-learning agent determines the control parameters (k, b) based on the ε-greedy policy [25] in this study. The principle of the ε-greedy policy is shown in Eq. (12). (12) π a | s ← 1 - ε + ε m , i f a = max a Q s , a ε m , i f a ≠ max a Q s , a where, π a | s is the probability of the action (a) when it is chosen at the state (s). It means that, for each control step, the probability for Q-learning agent to choose the known best action is 1 - ε + ε m according to the Q-table, while the probability for Q-learning agent to choose another action is ε m . ε is a predefined parameter representing the balance between exploration and exploitation, and ε is set to 0.3 in this study. m is the number of available actions to be chosen, which is set to 3 in this study. In this way, the Q-learning agent would choose an action most of the time, which has maximal estimated action value for exploitation. But there is probability for the Q-learning agent to select another random action for exploration. 3 Overview of the test commercial building, validation test platform and test arrangement To test the applicability and performance of the proposed iterative learning control strategy, a virtual dynamic simulation platform is developed using TRNSYS [29]. The real-time simulation platform of the building and its air-conditioning system is constructed referring to the actual system of a super-high-rise commercial building (International Commerce Centre) in Hong Kong and the main parameters are presented in Table 2 [5]. To make it simple and clear for control performance evaluation and demonstration, the dynamic test platform is developed by simplifying the actual energy system of the International Commerce Centre. The air-conditioning system for six typical and standard floors are concerned only in this study. The area of each building floor is 1,600 m2.The detailed physical models of the air-conditioning system in this test platform are calibrated using real data [5,30]. The test platform is a typical primary constant-secondary variable chilled water system and the schematic is shown in Fig. 6 . It consists of four identical chillers and each chiller\u2019s rated capacity is 4080 kW. For the primary chilled water pump side, each chiller is interlocked with a water pump with the constant speed of 172.8 L/s. For the secondary chilled water loop, there employs two variable speed water pumps and the chilled water is circulating in the AHUs to provide cooling source. The building is simulated using a multizone model (Type 56) in TRNSYS. The six typical floors concerned are considered as six individual building zones respectively (i.e., each floor is considered as a building zone). These zones have different cooling loads since the heat gains (including occupants, electrical devices, etc.) in these zones are different. Each building zone is cooled by an individual AHU. Each of the six air-conditioned zones is cooled by the supply air temperature from its corresponding AHU to its zone temperature setpoint. Each AHU cools down the supply air temperature to the pre-defined setpoint. In this study, a TRNSYS-MATLAB co-simulation test platform is constructed as shown in Fig. 7 . The iterative learning controller and other models (i.e., the building models and the air-conditioning system models) are built on TRNSYS 18 (32-bit), while the Q-learning agent is built on MATLAB 2014a (32-bit). Fig. 8 shows the overview of the simulation studio file for the TRNSYS-MATLAB co-simulation. Type 155 (in the TRNSYS library) is used for calling the MATLAB component. The weather data of a typical year in Hong Kong is adopted in the test. The office hour of the building is from 08:00 to 18:00, from Monday to Saturday. The air-conditioning system is switched off during the non-office hours. Prior to the morning start period in each working day, the iterative learning controller is activated, which adopts the proposed method as introduced earlier in Section 2. For the validation tests, the number of building zones n is set to 6 and a hot month (July) in Hong Kong is selected as the experimental operation period. A test period of four weeks, i.e., from July 2nd to July 29th, is selected. The control parameters (k, b) are determined and updated online using the Q-learning agent as described in Section 2.4. 4 Test results and analysis The control performance, precooling time reduction and energy saving are tested and analyzed to evaluate the feasibility and performance of the proposed control strategy. Two proposed indicators (tmax and cdi) are used to evaluate the control performance of the proposed iterative learning control strategy at morning start period, and it is also compared with that using the conventional feedback control. The precooling period starts before the office hour (8:00) every working day, and the air-conditioning system is switched off after the office hour (18:00). And the indoor air temperature setpoints for all the six building zones are 24℃. The energy saving of the chilled water system (chillers, primary pumps and secondary pumps) by adopting the proposed control strategy is quantitatively analyzed in the following. 4.1 Control operation and control performance 4.1.1 Valve opening control outputs The AHU valve opening control outputs for the six zones were determined by the proposed iterative learning control strategy every day at morning start period and the results are shown in Fig. 9 . For Day 1 (02/July), the initial valve openings were manually determined based on the normal operation data of the six AHU valve openings before the test period. The initial valve openings for the six AHUs were 1, 0.87, 0.82, 0.76, 0.65 and 0.6 correspondingly. Fig. 10 compares the AHU valve openings under the conventional control and the proposed control on a typical summer day (23/July). Unlike the conventional feedback control, all the AHU valves are set to be fully open for competing for the limited chilled water supply. It can be seen from the results that, when using the proposed strategy, the AHU valve openings corresponding to the six building zones were adjusted and then remained unchanged every day at morning start period. It can be seen from Fig. 9 that the valve opening for AHU 1 was controlled at 1 during morning start period in all test days under the proposed control. It indicates that the zone 1 is at a disadvantage for chilled water distribution among the six building zones. On the contrary, the valve opening of AHU 6 was controlled to be the lowest among the six AHUs during morning start period in all the test days. It indicates that the zone 6 has the advantage over competing for the limited chilled water supply. In summary, using the proposed iterative learning control strategy, the control outputs could be updated at each control interval (everyday morning start period) to continuously track the goal of consistent precooling lead time for different building zones. 4.1.2 Maximum return time among multiple zones The maximum return time among multiple zones from night setback (tmax ) is defined as a control performance indicator as illustrated in Section 2.2. It indicates the required precooling time for allowing all the building zones to reach the zone temperature setpoint from night setback. The value of tmax is expected to be as lower as possible. Fig. 11 presents the tmax under the proposed iterative learning control and the conventional feedback control. It can be found that under the proposed iterative learning control, the tmax was lower than that under the conventional control for the four-week test period. Among the test results, the maximum reduction of tmax was 0.19 h on Day 19 (23/July) and the maximum reduction percentage of tmax was 15.6% on Day 23 (27/July). For the convenience of comparison, the daily tmax over a week were summed up and the accumulated tmax of four weeks in the test period are shown and compared in Table 3 . It can be seen from Table 3 that the tmax reduction in Week 1 was 8.3%, and for the following three weeks the tmax reduction effect was over 11%. The results show that the proposed iterative learning control strategy reduced the maximum return time among the six building zones. It means that the required precooling time under the conventional feedback control was reduced when applying the proposed iterative learning control. 4.1.3 Cooling diversity The cooling diversity indicator (cdi) is another control performance indicator as introduced in Section 2.2. It represents the cooling diversity among the building zones at morning start period and it is expected to be as lower as possible. The results of cdi under the conventional feedback control and the proposed iterative learning control are compared in Fig. 12 . It can be observed from Fig. 12 that the cdi under the proposed control strategy is much lower than that of the conventional control. The reduction of cdi was not very significant on Day 1 (02/July). But after the first three test days, the cdi was significantly lower under the proposed control strategy than that under the conventional control. During the test period, the maximum reduction of cdi by applying the proposed control strategy was on Day 17 (20/July), the reduction was 0.47. The percentage of maximum cdi reduction was 86.8% on Day 23 (27/July). For the convenience of comparison, the daily average cdi over a week of the four weeks in the test period are shown and compared in Table 4 . The results show that for the first week, the cdi reduction was 49.1%. And for the following three test weeks, the cdi reduction was over 70%. The test results indicate that the proposed iterative learning control strategy significantly reduced the cooling diversity indicator (cdi). By applying the proposed control strategy, the consistence of precooling lead time among the six building zones was improved significantly. 4.2 Reduction of precooling time Based on the above control performance analysis, it is obvious that the proposed iterative learning control strategy could achieve better control performance than conventional feedback control on distributing the limited chilled water supply at morning start period. By applying the proposed iterative learning control strategy, the maximum return time (tmax ) among different building zones and the cooling diversity indicator (cdi) of different building zones were reduced significantly. In this way, the consistence of precooling lead time among different building zones was achieved by adjusting the AHU valve openings corresponding to individual building zones. The precooling time reduction was therefore achieved. Fig. 13 presents the precooling time reduction using the proposed control strategy on a single day, i.e., Day 19 (23/July). Fig. 13 (a) shows the temperature profiles of the six building zones under the conventional feedback control, it is obvious that the cooling-down speeds of indoor air temperature among the six building zones were significantly different. The precooling starts at around 6:26 AM under the conventional feedback control. At 8:00 AM, all of the zones reach the temperature setpoint. The Zone 6 reached its temperature setpoint 0.75 h earlier than Zone 1. The tmax was 1.57 h and the cdi was 0.48 under the conventional feedback control and the conventional precooling took 1.57 h. When the proposed strategy was used at the same condition, the cooling-down speeds among different building zones were much more similar as shown in Fig. 13 (b). The precooling starts at around 6:38 AM under the proposed control. All of the zones reach the temperature setpoint almost synchronously at 8:00 AM. The tmax was 1.38 h and the cdi was 0.14 and the precooling time was reduced to 1.38 h. Compared with using the conventional control strategy, the precooling time was reduced by 0.19 h (from 1.57 h to 1.38 h). The potential precooling time is reduced by 12.1% on a typical summer day (23/July) in Hong Kong. The daily reductions of the precooling time over the test period of four-week are shown in Table 5 and Fig. 14 . It can be found that the maximum daily reduction was 0.19 h on Day 19 (23/July). And the average daily reduction of precooling time was 0.1 h (10.9%) and the accumulated precooling time reduction over test period was 2.48 h. 4.3 Energy saving using proposed control strategy Based on the reduction of the precooling time obtained from the tests, the energy saving of the proposed iterative learning control strategy can be quantified. In the system, the energy consumption of the main chilled water plant includes that of the chillers, primary pumps and secondary pumps. Table 6 shows the comparation between the energy consumptions using proposed iterative learning control and the conventional control on a typical summer day (23/July). The reduction of the precooling time was 0.19 h when adopting the proposed iterative learning control. As shown in Table 6, the major energy saving was from the chillers and the overall energy saving was 695 kWh (12.8%) by using the proposed control strategy. The energy saving during the whole four-week test is shown in Table 7 and Fig. 15 . It can be seen that the maximum daily overall energy saving was 695 kWh on Day 19 (23/July). The average daily overall energy saving was about 400 kWh (12.4% saving) and the accumulated overall energy saving over the test period (four weeks) was 9615 kWh. 5 Conclusions For commercial buildings, the precooling time is extended significantly due to the obvious different cooling-down speed of different building zones and it leads to significant energy waste. To deal with this typical operation problem, a new iterative learning control strategy is proposed to properly distribute the limited cooling supply at morning start period. The control outputs (valve openings) are updated every day. The iterative learning control strategy can continuously track the goal of consistent precooling lead time for different building zones at morning start period. A Q-learning agent is developed for selecting and tuning the parameters of the iterative learning controller based on the Q-table method. Based on the experiences and results of the validation tests, a few major findings are summarized as below. o The proposed iterative learning control strategy could update the control outputs at each control interval (each day) to continuously track the goal of consistent precooling lead time for different building zones. o The proposed iterative learning control strategy could reduce the maximum return time among multiple zones from night setback (tmax ) and the cooling diversity indicator (cdi). The average reduction of the daily precooling time was 0.1 h (10.9% reduction) and the accumulated reduction of the precooling time was 2.48 h during the test period of four weeks. o The proposed iterative learning control strategy could significantly achieve energy saving. The average overall daily energy saving of the chilled water plant was 400 kWh and the accumulated overall energy saving was 9615 kWh over the test period of four weeks. It is worth noting that the proposed iterative learning control strategy is novel and can be conveniently implemented in engineering practice.

        "dc:description": "Air-conditioning systems in commercial buildings are usually switched on in advance to precool the indoor spaces to create an acceptable working environment upon the office hour. However, the central cooling systems often fail to provide enough cooling supply capacity due to the high cooling demand at the morning start period especially in hot seasons. In this situation, the imbalanced cooling distribution in the air-conditioning systems often results in large difference of cooling-down speed among different building zones, so that the precooling time has to be extended, leading to significant energy waste. This study proposes a new iterative learning control strategy to properly manage the cooling distribution (i.e., water valve openings of air-handling units) for achieving uniform cooling (i.e., synchronously reaching the indoor dry-blub temperature setpoint) among building zones during the morning start period. A reinforcement learning method (Q-learning) is adopted for the control parameter setting of the developed iterative learning controller. Validation tests are conducted and results show that the proposed control strategy could reduce the daily precooling time up to 12.1% during typical days in Hong Kong by achieving uniform cooling. The daily energy consumption could be reduced between 5.1% and 17.8% by shortening morning start period, corresponding a weekly electrical energy saving between 1,376 kWh and 2,916 kWh in the test building.",
