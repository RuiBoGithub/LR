Model-based real-time optimization (MRTO) is proven as an effective tool that can capture the complex dynamics of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems and improve its energy performance. Despite the energy benefits offered by MRTO, these approaches are rarely implemented in actual buildings. This is due to the reason that these approaches are very difficult to implement because they require the synthesis of a reliable and accurate performance model of the system. The reliability of decision-making with MRTO is directly related to the accuracy of these performance models. In addition, the model has to be computationally efficient for practical implementation. The development of such a model requires the most effort and is a major challenge in the implementation of MRTO. Several HVAC performance models are already available in the literature, and these can be classified as semiphysical models and data-driven models. The semiphysical models are generalized models with simplification assumptions that can provide consistent performance, however, with reduced accuracy. Contrastingly, the data-driven models can offer better accuracy; however, they lack robustness in terms of operational ranges. These factors affect the energy performance of MRTO, and an improper parametrized model could result in performance that is even worse than the conventional fixed setpoint or rule-based approaches. A dissimilarity-driven ensemble model-based real-time optimization (DEMRTO) approach is presented in this study that incorporates a dissimilarity-driven ensemble model in the framework of real-time optimization. The dissimilarity-driven ensemble model combines semiphysical models and data-driven models in a systematic manner to use one's strengths to address others' weaknesses, rather than developing a new form of a model. The performance of the proposed integrated approach was examined using case studies over three weather seasons in Hong Kong. The results showed as compared to the fixed setpoint approach the DEMRTO approach can provide significant energy savings up to 11.085% setpoint, and around 2.785% reduction in energy use as compared with the conventional MRTO approach. It was demonstrated that the proposed approach can capture diversity in load conditions and provide consistency in model prediction to improve reliability in decision-making with real-time optimization.

Image 1 Keywords Building energy efficiency Heating ventilation And air conditioning system Model-based real-time optimization Model mismatch Dissimilarity-driven ensemble model 1 Introduction The building industry faces international pressure to save energy and reduce CO2 emissions due to climate change concerns [1]. The heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems consume about 50% of buildings' energy use [2], which account for about 50% of the worlds' energy use [3]. It is pertinent to reduce the energy use of these systems to bring about energy efficiency in buildings [4]. The model-based real-time optimization (MRTO) of these systems is receiving interest and is considered an effective approach for energy efficiency in buildings [5\u20138]. The MRTO tries to minimize the objective [i.e., generally the power, energy, or operational cost of the building HVAC system] by searching the system's optimal operational setting, using some optimization technique. A system performance model defines the relationship between the objective function and system operational settings and the given ambient conditions. Previous studies have shown MRTO can capture complex dynamics and interactions in the HVAC system to attain significant energy saving (∼30%) while satisfying indoor thermal comfort and air quality [8,9]. Despite the demonstrated potential of MRTO, these approaches are rarely implemented in the operation of real buildings. This is due to the barrier in developing a performance model that is accurate, reliable, and practical enough for implementation. The accuracy and consistent prediction performance of the model used in MRTO lead to reliability in optimization [10,11]. The MRTO of building HVAC systems is always a mathematical programming problem due to a multitude of equations needed to capture dynamics of HVAC components and interactions between them, the use of many constraints in the optimization problem, and a number of setpoints [operational settings] that are to be optimized. Furthermore, it is important to consider computational load while setting up a performance model of HVAC systems for practical implementations [12]. The development of such a model is considered a major challenge [around 70% of work] in the implementation of MRTO [13]. The commonly used modelling techniques can be classified into two \u2013 semiphysical models and data-driven models [11]. Semiphysical models are developed using physical laws and principles [14,15]. They are generally used as they use simplified assumptions to reduce the complexity of the mathematical description while still holding some physical meanings. For instance, a model-based optimization strategy was developed for building systems by Zavala (2012), using a simplified physical model of conditioned space [16]. It was demonstrated iterations between different parameters could lead to significant energy savings. Du et al. (2016) developed a dual benchmark-based control index evaluation factor to evaluate an airport HVAC system's operation under different control strategies [17]. The exergy loss model of the system was developed with the help of fundamental laws and principles, and twelve control strategies for HVAC systems were tested through this approach. Wang et al. (2016) developed an event-triggered optimization strategy for the HVAC system, using a simplified physical model of HVAC components [15]. These models can be considered as generalized models that can provide consistent performance. However, the use of simplification assumptions limits the potency to develop an accurate model even when enough performance data is available [11]. Recently, several studies have considered the data-driven models for the synthesis of MRTO [18]. The data-driven models are developed with some potent data-driven techniques such as artificial neural network (ANN), using the system performance data. In a study, Kusiak and Xu (2012) presented an optimal control strategy for HVAC systems using the ANN model [19]. It was shown that energy saving of up to 30% was possible. He (2014) developed an optimization algorithm for the HVAC system using ANN to capture the dynamics of the HVAC system and five rooms [20]. The results demonstrated that the optimization algorithm could provide energy saving up to 18.5%. A model predictive controller (MPC) with ANN model was developed in Ref. [21] for a residential HVAC system. It was demonstrated that the proposed MPC can reduce the operating cost. These data-driven models can provide improved accuracy compared to semiphysical models, with significant computation speed advantage making them viable for practical application [11]. It is demonstrated these MRTO can bring about significant energy savings when properly set up. However, data-driven models have an inherent problem as they depend on the operational data used in the model training [10]. Operating outside this range can cause model mismatches of the data-drive model and even lead to instability [due to frequent resetting of setpoints]. Consequently, the model mismatch cannot be avoided in practice due to strong nonlinearities in the dynamics of the HVAC system and high diversity in its operating conditions. This generally results in poor performance of MRTO, reducing the expected energy saving [22]. This paper presents a novel dissimilarity-driven ensemble model-based real-time optimization (DEMRTO) approach for building HVAC systems. Rather than developing any new form of the model to set up optimization for building HVAC systems, the proposed approach systemically synthesizes the real-time optimization problem by addressing the issues with the semiphysical model and data-driven model by combining them, to bring reliability in decision making. This is a first attempt to use a hybrid performance model or digital twin to consider the complexities and nonlinearities associated with large-scale building HVAC systems for the system's optimal and energy-efficient operation, and the proposed approach can be easily extended for other building energy systems, such as thermal storage, renewable energy systems etc. In the proposed approach, a batch - nonlinear autoregressive exogenous artificial neural network (NARX) model of HVAC systems is incorporated as a piecewise accurate model, i.e. updated with a sliding window of data for robustness enhancement in terms of the range of operation. A complete semiphysical model of the HVAC system is selected as a generalized one that can provide consistent performance with a manageable computational load. Both models were combined with an ensembling technique introduced in Ref. [23] to develop a highly accurate model that is integrated into the framework of real-time optimization that results in reliability in decision-making with the proposed DEMRTO approach. This application can be very challenging due to a hybrid model structure since the NARX model is batch trained and relies on both real-time data from the system and some parameters from the semiphysical model, with online validation. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, it was tested on a testbed of a large-scale building HVAC system built in a TRNSYS simulator. The DEMRTO algorithm was programmed in MATLAB and linked with TRNSYS. A validated model of the Mega grade A building in Hong Kong was used to generate the ambient operating conditions for the testing, and the proposed approach was evaluated under different weather seasons. Case studies were performed to compare results with DEMRTO approach with conventional model-based real-time optimization and fixed setpoint approaches, and the performance improvements were analyzed in the aspect of energy use, associated emissions, online model prediction accuracy and computational load. This paper is structured as follows. Section 2 details the methodology used for the proposed DEMRTO approach, including an overview of HVAC system optimization, synthesis of DEMRTO approach and description of dissimilarity-driven ensemble model, with ANN model construction and semiphysical model selection. Then, Section 3 presents the details of the HVAC system testbed, control setup and comparative studies to evaluate the proposed approach's performance. Finally, the concluding remarks are presented in Section 4. 2 Methodology 2.1 Overview Suppose the total power of an HVAC system can be written as (1) P t o t , k = f ( v 1 , k , ⋯ , v m , k ) where v 1 , ⋯ , v m are the variables that are optimized, and k is the time instant. Then, the real-time optimization can be formulated as (2) ( v 1 , k ∗ , ⋯ , v 1 , k ∗ ) = arg min v 1 , k , ⋯ , v m , k m i n f ( v 1 , k , ⋯ , v m , k ) which is subject to (3) φ ( v 1 , k , ⋯ , v m , k ) ≤ 0 where the subscript * indicates the optimal values. This is a constrained optimization problem. At each time instant, the optimization should be solved, and the decision variables should be updated. The performance models are used to define the relation between the total power P t o t and the decision variables ( v 1 , ⋯ , v m ) . In a typical HVAC system, the power consumed components include cooling towers, chillers, pumps and fans. Therefore, the total power P t o t is (4) P t o t = P f a n + P c h + P w p + P c t where P c h the total power of operating chillers; P c t is the total power of the operating cooling towers; P w p is the total power of the operating water pumps; and P f a n is the total power of the operating fans. The decision variables are always the setpoints of the basic local control loops, including the supply air temperature, the chilled water supply temperature, and the cooling water supply temperature. The details of the performance models are given in Section 2.3. Many studies have already demonstrated that the performance models given by ASHRAE Handbook are simple and easy for application [24]. However, its accuracy depends heavily on the training data. Fig. 1 gives an example to demonstrate that a model trained under a condition cannot be accurate under another condition. In this example, the model was trained under spring conditions and tested under summer conditions. The model performance suffers from large mismatches in several periods for the summer conditions. Therefore, to increase the reliability of real-time optimization, it is essential to maintain the accuracy of the performance model. 2.2 The proposed control approach The schematic of the proposed DEMRTO approach is presented in Fig. 2 . It incorporated both systems' internal performance data and the external operating environment. The data monitoring and processing are implemented through a sliding window [25], including new data and discarding the old data for batch training. The sliding window size was fixed [describing how old data remains in the window] based on the findings in Ref. [23], and the window update frequency is the same as the optimization frequency. The time-triggered optimization of complex HVAC systems is carried out [optimizing system decision variables with constant frequency], using the dissimilarity-driven ensemble model [23] to ensure accurate, reliable, and robust prediction performance. Initially, the only semiphysical model, i.e., trained offline, is used in the optimization problem until the sliding window fills up and the first batch of data is available for the training of the ANN-based NARX model. The distinguishing feature of proposed real-time optimization is the use of dissimilarity-driven ensemble model, which will be discussed in the following section. 2.3 Dissimilarity-driven ensemble model This study aims to improve real-time optimization performance by improving the accuracy of model prediction and reliability with MRTO. Rather than developing a new form of a model, this study combines two of the most accepted HVAC systems modelling techniques [11] systematically, as illustrated in Fig. 3 , taking advantage of their strengths while addressing weaknesses. This includes a NARX model and a semiphysical model of the system. The NARX model was selected for its accuracy and computational efficiency; however, they depend on the data operational range used in the model training, thus lacking robustness and cannot ensure reliability since stable prediction performance over the complete operational range is difficult to achieve [10]. To address these weaknesses; (1) NARX model was batch trained to update the range of operation and enhance its robustness for a piecewise accurate model, (2) a semiphysical model was incorporated to ensure reliable performance [with manageable computational load] with simplifying assumptions and reasonable model accuracy [12]. A dissimilarity-driven boosting technique is synthesized to ensemble predictions from both models based on the NARX model's performance [23]. It uses a weighted average to combine predictions from the NARX model and semiphysical model, where dissimilarity-driven validation of the NARX model is used to dynamically generate weights [range 0\u20131]. The dual-tree wavelet transform ( D T W T ) with structure-similarity ( S S I M ) [26] was utilized for dissimilarity analysis as it can handle noisy data, and data with delays and missing samples. It transforms time-series validation data into the DTWT domain to give DTWT coefficients presented in Eqn. (5). These coefficients are compared with S S I M using Eqn. (6) to give the dissimilarity index i \u2032 [where similarity index would simply be the i = 1 − i \u2032 ]. This index is used as weights to the ensemble P 1 , k + 1 \u2032 prediction from NARX model and P 2 , k + 1 \u2032 prediction from the semiphysical model using Eqn. (7), to give P k + 1 \u2032 ensemble prediction. The algorithm classifies dissimilarity in the NARX model's validation data. When the validation results from NARX model are not accurate, the weights assigned to the NARX model prediction will be small compared to weights assigned to the semiphysical model prediction that will be large. Thus, the semiphysical model will carry more weight towards the final prediction. Instances when the validation results from NARX model are accurate, the NARX model prediction will be utilized more in final prediction.

As illustrated in Fig. 3, both environmental and system performance data are utilized by the optimizer. The size of the sliding window used for batch training is 24 h. NARX is selected as the ANN model's internal architecture since it is a potant technique for modelling time-series data. NARX models of three major subsystems: air handling unit (AHU), chiller plant, and cooling tower, were considered in this study. The internal architecture and configuration of NARX models are illustrated in Section 2.3.1. Furthermore, a complete semiphysical model of the HVAC system that includes: AHU, chiller, cooling tower, heat exchanger, chilled water pumps at primary and secondary, and condenser water pump was selected, i.e. detailed in Section 2.3.2. Note apart from recorded operational data, data from the semiphysical model was utilized for batch training. This includes the cooling tower load Q c t , and AHU fan's air mass flow rate m ˙ f a n . 2.3.1 ANN model construction This study incorporates a batch trained NARX model to improve the prediction accuracy [19]. The total power use is considered as the objective function in the case study. Therefore, the NARX model was constructed to predict the power use of major subsystems, AHU, chiller and cooling tower, while semiphysical models [discussed in Section 2.3.2] were used to constitute for use of pumps heat exchanger. The NARX model's training was carried out in an open-loop form since the actual output measurements were available while training. At time instant k the output of the NARX is expressed by Eqn. (8). Where, x 1 , k , \u2026 , x n , k and P k is the input data with u x and u p regressor or leg space, respectively. The input data for the AHU NARX model includes supply air temperature T s a , and AHU fan air mass flow rate m ˙ A H U , while AHU fan power use P 1 , A H U \u2032 was the output. The input data for the chiller NARX model includes chilled water supply temperature at primary T c h s , 1 , chilled water return temperature at primary T c h r , 1 , condenser water supply temperature T c w s , and cooling load Q , with chiller power use P 1 , c h \u2032 as the output. The input data for the cooling tower NARX model includes condenser water supply temperature T c w s , wet-bulb temperature T w b of incoming air into cooling tower, and heat to be rejected by the cooling tower Q c t , while the cooling towers fan power use P 1 , c t \u2032 was the output. The AHU fan air mass flow rate m ˙ A H U and heat to be rejected by the cooling tower Q c t were used from the calculations of the semiphysical model. P 1 , k \u2032 = f ( x 1 , k − 1 , x 1 , k − 2 , \u2026 , x 1 , k − u x , \u2026 , (8) x n , k − 1 , x n , k − 2 , \u2026 , x n , k − u x , P k − 1 , P k − 2 , \u2026 , P k − u p ) The multilayer perceptron (MLP) network with 1 input layer, 1 hidden layer and 1 output layer was selected as the internal architecture of NARX model for each subsystem. The mean square error (MSE) was used to evaluate the performance of trained models of each subsystem. The number of neurons in the hidden layer was identified in a systematic manner by testing the number of neurons from 1 to 100 for each subsystem. The MSE decreases as the number of neurons increases in the hidden layer. The number of neurons after which MSE doesn't reduce much was selected. The number of neurons in the hidden layer for the AHU NARX model was 4, for the chiller NARX model was 6, and for the cooling tower NARX model was 5. The lag space ( u x , u p ) was calibrated using the Lipschitz quotients method [27] to capture the dynamics of the system. The number of regressors were found to be u x = 2 , u p = 2 for AHU, u x = 2 , u p = 2 for chiller, u x = 1 , u p = 2 for cooling tower. The hyperbolic tangent function was used as transfer function in the hidden neurons, and a linear function was used in the output neurons. As illustrated in Fig. 3, NARX models for each subsystem were batch trained with 24 h sliding window to enhance the robustness while maintaining the models' accuracy. The frequency of system optimization, i.e. 1-hour, was set as the frequency for batch training. The training of the NARX model was set up using the Bayesian regularization-backpropagation [28]. 2.3.2 Semiphysical model selection A semiphysical model of a building HVAC system was selected as a generalized model for the proposed optimization strategy. Fig. 4 illustrates all subsystems, coupling between them in terms of inputs and output, and identifies the power use elements. 2.3.2.1 Semiphysical AHU model The semiphysical model of AHU was used to calculate the chilled water return temperature at secondary T c h r , 2 , required secondary chilled water mass flow rate m ˙ c h , 2 , power use of secondary chiller water pump P c h , p 2 and the AHU power use P 2 , A H U \u2032 . The chilled water return temperature at secondary T c h r , 2 is estimated using the chilled water supply temperature at secondary T c h s , 2 and air supply temperature T s a , using Eqn. (9). The chilled water mass flow rate at secondary m ˙ c h , 2 is calculated using the heat transfer Q from air to water and the difference between return and supply chilled water temperatures at AHU, using Eqn. (10). (9) T c h r , 2 = 2 ⋅ T s a − T c h s , 2 (10) m ˙ c h , 2 = Q C p , w ( T c h w r , 2 − T c h w s , 2 ) The power use of secondary chiller water pump P c h , p 2 is calculated by (11) P c h , p 2 = β 1 m ˙ c h , 2 3 where β 1 is the model parameter. The power use in the AHU is the power used by the AHU fan. The fan power use was estimated using the supply air mass flow rate m ˙ A H U . The AHU fan power use P 2 , A H U \u2032 is calculated by (12) P 2 , A H U \u2032 = β 2 m ˙ A H U 3 Note that T s a is the air supply setpoint temperature, T c h s , 2 is the setpoint for chilled water supply at secondary temperature, and β 2 is the model parameter. The model parameters were identified offline using the genetic algorithm (GA) [29]. 2.3.2.2 Semiphysical chiller plant model The semiphysical chiller model calculates the chiller power use P 2 , c h \u2032 , chilled water return temperature at primary T c h r , 1 and power use of the primary chiller water pump P c h , p 1 . The evaporator heat transfer coefficients U A e v and condenser heat transfer coefficients U A c d are directly estimated using Eqns. (13) and (14), respectively. (13) U A e v = 1 β c h 3 m ˙ c h , 1 − 0.8 + β c h 4 Q e v − 0.745 + β c h 5 (14) U A c d = 1 β c h 6 m ˙ c w − 0.8 + β c h 7 ( Q e v + P c h ) 1 / 3 + β c h 8 where m ˙ c h , 1 is the chilled water mass flow rate on the primary side, Q e v is the cooling supplied by each chiller, m ˙ c w is the condenser water mass flow rate, P c h is the chiller power use, and β 3 \u2026 β 8 are model parameters. The chilled water supply temperature at primary T c h s , 1 and condenser water return temperature T c w r are calculated using heat transfer coefficients by Eqns. (15) and (16). The specific enthalpies ( h 1 \u2032 , h 2 \u2032 and h 4 \u2032 ) can be calculated by chilled water supply temperature at primary T c h s , 1 and condenser water supply temperature T c w s .

The actual power use of the chiller P 2 , c h \u2032 can be calculated using Eqn. (20). Where P c h , f i c is the fictitious power of the refrigeration cycle [30] that is calculated using Eqn. (21), and m ˙ f is the refrigerant mass flow rate calculated Eqn. (22).

The power use of primary chiller water pump T c h r , 1 is (23) T c h r , 1 = T c h s , 1 + Q e v m ˙ c h , 1 C p , w The power use of chiller water pump at the primary side P c h , p 1 is given by (24) P c h , p 1 = β 12 m ˙ c h , 1 3 where β 12 is the model parameter. Note that T s a is the for air supply setpoint temperature, T c h s , 1 is setpoint for chilled water supply at primary temperature, T c w s is setpoint for condenser water supply temperature, and the model parameter were identified offline using the GA. 2.3.2.3 Symphysial cooling tower model The cooling tower model was used to calculate the power use ofcondenser water pump P c t , p , air mass flow rate in cooling tower m ˙ a and power use of cooling tower fan P 2 , c t \u2032 . The heat transfer between water and air in the cooling tower is in balance given by (25) Q c t = c w m ˙ c w ( T c w r − T c w s ) = Q c h + P c h (26) Q a = m ˙ a ( h a o − h a i ) The power use of the condenser water pump P c t , p is given by (27) P c t , p = β 13 m ˙ c h , 1 3 where β 13 is the model parameter.

Note that T c w s is the condenser water supply setpoint temperature, and the model parameter were identified offline using the GA. 2.4 Optimization of HVAC power use with HGA The performance and reliability of the optimization problem rely on the system performance model accuracy. The system performance models were realized to have a relationship between the system operating decision variables or setpoints and the total power use that are discussed in Section 2.3. The optimization problem set up in this manner will be sensitive to both internal and external operating conditions. The HVAC system illustrated in Fig. 5 has following local control loops; supply air loop, chilled water loop primary, chilled water loop secondary, and condenser water loop, with their respective decision variables; supply air temperature T s a , k , chilled water supply temperature at primary T c h s , 1 , k , chilled water supply temperature at secondary T c h s , 2 , k , and condenser water supply temperature T c w s , k ,. The real-time optimization was synthesized to regulate these setpoints for the present internal/external conditions for optimal system operation by searching for optimal operational setting [12,31]. The building HVAC system used in this study is an electric system without thermal storage, i.e., commonly used for commercial applications. Thus, the cost function utilized in this study is the total power use of the system, i.e., presented in Eqn. (36). Note minimizing the total power use at any time instant is equivalent to minimizing the total energy use. The optimization problem is presented in Eqn. (37), where the objective is to search for the optimal setting of setpoints for the system's optimal and energy-efficient operation.

Furthermore, finding an analytic solution to the problem in Eqn. (37) is challenging due to the highly nonlinear nature of the performance models. Therefore, this study incorporates hybrid genetic algorithms (HGA) [32] to solve the problem in Eqn. (37) for optimal setpoint setting. The HGA utilize the GA ability to search quickly through global search space [29]. However, local search can be difficult for GA where it can struggle to find local minima and cannot guarantee an optimal solution. Therefore, a quasi-Newton algorithm [33], i.e., a gradient-based algorithm, was used for the local search. The initial population from the GA is used by quasi-Newton algorithm to ensure fast and guaranteed convergence of the optimization problem. A case study is provided in the following section to test and discuss the performance of the proposed DEMRTO approach. 3 Configuration of the simulation testbed and inputs 3.1 System details A building HVAC system, that is suitable for large-scale commercial buildings, has been considered for this study. The simulation testbed of a large-scale building HVAC system was built using a TRNSYS simulator, where the HVAC system testbed was built in a TRNSYS simulator, while the model-based real-time optimization was programmed in MATLAB and linked by Type 155 component of TRNSYS. The HVAC system configuration utilized in this study is illustrated in Fig. 5. The building HVAC system testbed in the TRNSYS simulator consists of 6 water cooled centrifugal chillers, each with 7239 kW rated capacity, to generate cooling with chilled water. To reject chiller condensers heat 11 cross-flow cooling towers were used, each with a rated mass flow rate of 251 l/s, were used to reject heat from chiller condensers. Constant speed pumps with a rated mass flow rate of 344 l/s and 411 l/s, were used to interlock chilled water primary loop and condenser water loop, respectively. To maintain the desired supply air setpoint temperature, 7 heat exchangers delivered chilled water to AHUs. Overall, 4 local control loops in this system with their respective operating setpoints significantly influence the HVAC system's energy performance. These 4 setpoints are the supply air temperature T s a , the chilled water supply temperature at primary T c h s , 1 , the chilled water supply temperature at secondary T c h s , 2 and the condenser water supply temperature T c w s [12,31], which are periodically optimized and regulated by local loop controllers to keep the effective operation and energy-efficient of the system. The ambient operating conditions and the cooling load were generated separately and used with the building HVAC system simulation testbed. A TRNSYS model of 90-floor high office building located at the center of Hong Kong was built. This building offers 24-h services, including air-conditioning, power supply, security access and so on. The results from this building model were compared with the actual building data for validation in Ref. [34]. The data generated from this building model includes building cooling loads, occupancy level and meteorological data, the ambient dry-bulb, wet-bulb temperatures, and relative humidity. 3.2 Local-level control setup The number of chiller plants required to operate at a given time is determined by chiller sequencing control. This study employs total-cooling-load-based chiller sequencing control, using measured cooling load during the operation to bring a chiller online and offline. The total cooling load is calculated by Eqn. (44), using the measurement from the chilled water primary sides: the mass flow rate m c h , 1 and the difference between the chilled water return at primary temperature T c h r , 1 and chilled water supply temperature at primary T c h s , 1 . The number of chiller plants required to satisfy the given cooling load requirement is given by Eqn. (45), dividing the total cooling load equally on all operating chillers, where the capacity of one chiller is Q c h , c a p , i.e., Q c h , c a p = 7230 kW; and ceil (.) function is to round off to the closest largest integer. (44) Q c h = c p , w m ˙ c h , 1 ( T c h r , 1 − T c h s , 1 ) (45) N c h = ceil ( Q c h / Q c h , c a p ) \u203e The number of cooling towers required to remove heat from condensers is determined by cooling tower sequencing control. Considering the coupling of the cooling tower with the chiller, the number of operating chillers is used to calculate the number of cooling towers using Eqn. (46), where chiller plant's configuration defines the coefficient ψ . (46) N c t = ψ N c h The optimal operating setpoints generated by the real-time optimization are updated to local-loop controllers that maintain the stability of control variables. In this study, the component Type 23 of TRNSYS was used as proportional-integral (PI) controllers to maintain stable operation in local control loops [35,36]. 4 Case study results and analysis The proposed DEMRTO approach's performance was evaluated based on the following criteria: energy performance and associated emissions of the DEMRTO approach under different weather conditions; and respective online performance of dissimilarity-driven ensemble model in the aspect of prediction accuracy and computational load for the DEMRTO approach. 4.1 Energy use and carbon emission results comparison To evaluate DEMRTO approach's energy performance, it was compared with two other approaches; the model-based real-time optimization (MRTO) approach that utilizes the semiphysical model constructed in Section 2.3.2 and the fixed setpoint (FSP) approach that keeps the operating setpoints fixed for each weather condition. To judge the reliability of the DEMRTO approach, the performance was examined under three different weather seasons: spring, summer and autumn; over the period of one month. The cooling load profile and ambient temperatures for spring - April, summer - July, and autumn - September are shown in Fig. 6 , where T d b is the dry-bulb temperature and T w b is the wet-bulb temperature. The mean cooling load for the month of spring was 4846 kW with a peak load of 14039 kW at 518 h. The month of summer had the mean cooling load for the month was 8992 kW with a peak load of 19663 kW at 224 h. The mean cooling load for the month of autumn was 7196 kW with a peak load of 16790 kW at 56 h. The operating setting for each season for the FSP approach used as a benchmarking case is presented in Table 1 . The optimization problem in Eqn. (37), subject to system performance model [either dissimilarity-driven ensemble model in Section 2.3 or semiphysical model in Section 2.3.2] and operational constraints defined in Eqns. (38)\u2013(43) was solved using HGAs. Table 2 defines the operational constraints and thresholds used in the optimization problem. The data sampling frequency was 1 min in this study and the system optimization frequency was 1 h [24]. The proposed DEMRTO approach initially uses the semiphysical model until the sliding window [i.e. 24 h] of data fills up and the first batch of data is made available for NARX model's batch training, then dissimilarity-driven ensemble model is used by the optimization problem. Note, since the dissimilarity-driven ensemble model is available after the first 24 h, the first day was not considered in this comparison. To find the environmental impact of each approach associated CO2 emissions E M CO 2 [37] were calculated using total energy use E U by, (47) E M CO 2 = E U . e e where e e is the emission factor for electricity that was set to 0.756 ton/MWh. The power use comparison of the proposed DEMRTO approach with the MRTO approach and FSP approach under three weather seasons: spring, summer and autumn is presented in Fig. 7. Fig. 7 a presents the power use comparison for the month of spring. In the benchmark case, the FSP approach provided the total energy use of 1208.811 MWh. The conventional MRTO approach provided the total energy use of 1173.186 MWh. The proposed DEMRTO approach provided the most energy-efficient performance. The total energy use for the DEMRTO approach was 1154.999 MWh. Similarly, the energy performances for the month of summer and autumn are presented in Fig. 7 b and c, where more pronounced differences in power use between the three approaches can be seen. Both MRTO and DEMRTO approaches provided less power use when compared to FSP approach. A more obvious difference in the power use of the MRTO approach and DEMRTO approach is during the high load period. Table 3 analyses the total energy use of three approaches for three seasons. It can be seen that the proposed DEMRTO approach provided the most energy-efficient performance over all three seasons. The DEMRTO approach provided a 4.452% reduction in energy use compared with the FSP approach and 1.550% compared with the MRTO approach, i.e. for the month of spring. The month of summer experienced the most reduction in energy use with the DEMRTO approach, i.e. 11.085% compared with the FSP approach and 2.785% compared with the MRTO approach. The DEMRTO approach for the month of autumn demonstrated a decrease in energy use by 6.733% compared with the FSP approach and 2.365% compared with the MRTO approach. The associated emissions for the three approaches are presented in Chart 1. In the benchmark case, the FSP approach resulted in CO2 emissions of 913.861 ton. The conventional MRTO approach caused CO2 emissions of 886.928 ton. The proposed DEMRTO approach significantly reduced CO2 emissions, with 873.179 ton. There was a substantial reduction in respective CO2 emissions with the proposed DEMRTO approach; 40.681 ton for spring, 204.444 ton for summer, and 99.174 ton for autumn compared to the benchmark case. Note this CO2 emissions reduction is only for 29 days for the respective weather season considered in this case study. To further analyze the online performance of dissimilarity-driven ensemble model's in the optimization problem, it was assessed with respect to its prediction accuracy and computational load, which will be discussed in the following sections. 4.2 Prediction accuracy comparison To capture the online prediction accuracy of models, power use predictions from three modelling techniques, semiphysical model, NARX model, and dissimilarity-driven ensemble model, were calculated before each optimization cycle. To analyze the accuracy of each modelling technique, plots were used to compare the model's estimates with the actual power measurements of AHU, chiller, and cooling tower [as the reference]. Fig. 8 a presents the AHU power use estimates from three modelling techniques. The chiller power use estimates are presented in Fig. 8 b, and Fig. 8 c presents the cooling tower power use estimates from three modelling techniques. Fig. 8 shows the prediction performance of semiphysical model has mismatches (error) in its prediction performance; where it can be seen, there are more and bigger mismatches during the high load period. This is consistent with the power use performance of the MRTO approach, where the more obvious difference in the power use of the MRTO approach and DEMRTO approach was during the high load period. It can be seen the NARX model provided improvement prediction performance as compared to semiphysical model for all three subsystems AHU, chiller, and cooling tower; however, large outliers were observed. The outliers in the prediction performance of the NARX model can be seen both during low and high load periods. These outliers would significantly affect the overall accuracy and reliability of the model. The proposed dissimilarity-driven ensemble model provided the best performance as compared to NARX and semiphysical model. This is because the proposed model does not experience model mismatches like semiphysical model and experienced fewer and smaller outliers from the NARX model in the final ensemble prediction, as shown in Fig. 8. To quantify the prediction performance following performance criteria were utilized: the coefficient of determination ( R 2 ) and goodness of fit. The R 2 value was calculated using Eqn. (28), and a value close to 1 indicates the high prediction accuracy of the model. The goodness of fit [with normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) as the cost function] was utilized as an overall performance indicator. The smaller value of goodness of fit suggests better accuracy. (48) R 2 = 1 − ∑ ( e i − e ˆ ) 2 ∑ ( e i − e \u203e ) 2 ; e \u203e = 1 n ∑ i = 1 n e i where e i is a reference value, e ˆ is predicted value, and e \u203e is mean value. The prediction accuracy for three subsystems with three modelling techniques in the aspect of R 2 value is presented in Table 4 a. It can be seen the NARX model provided improvement prediction performance as compared to semiphysical model for all three subsystems AHU, chiller, and cooling tower, in the aspect of R 2 values. However, the proposed dissimilarity-driven ensemble model presented the best R 2 values for all three subsystems. This is because the proposed model experienced fewer and smaller outliers than the NARX model. In Table 4 b, the goodness of fit is presented as an overall prediction accuracy measure to quantify the performance. It should be noted that the NARX model did not provide much improvement in the aspect of goodness of fit compared to the semiphysical model; even the goodness of fit for the chiller NARX model was slightly larger. The proposed model provided significant improvement for all three subsystems; 74.661% improvement for AHU, 68.671% improvement for chiller, and 53.427% improvement for cooling tower, compared to the semiphysical model. The improvement, when compared to the NARX model, were; 74.050% for AHU, 70.848% for the chiller, and 42.523% for the cooling tower. This signifies the proposed model's high accuracy, which translates into decision-making reliability with the proposed DEMRTO approach. 4.3 Error analysis In order to further analyze errors in the prediction performance, three models were analyzed for outliers. The absolute error between the predictions and the actual measurements was calculated, and samples with a difference greater than the predefined threshold were considered an outlier. The threshold used in this evaluation was 100 kW for both AHU and chiller models and 40 kW for the cooling tower models. To further analyze for consistency in prediction performance, the zeros were removed from the initial outlier's data, and this data was used to produce the box plots to realize the range of these outliers. Fig. 9 presents the performance of three models with respect to outliers and the range of outliers with the box plot. Fig. 9 a shows that the semiphysical model suffers from most outliers. It can be seen from the box plot that the 75th percentile of the interquartile range (IQR) was below 300 kW with a maximum below 800 kW for AHU and chiller, and for the cooling tower 75th percentile of IQR was at 63.5413 kW with a maximum at 158.856 kW, indicating the inconsistent performance of semiphysical model. NARX model has a smaller number of outliers, as illustrated in Fig. 9 b, than the semiphysical model. However, the NARX model does not offer much improvement in consistency. Fig. 9b shows that the 75th percentile of IQR for the NARX model was at 597.001 kW with a maximum of 1105.358 kW for AHU. The 75th percentile of IQR for the chiller was 829.875 kW with a maximum of 1524.797 kW. The 75th percentile of IQR for the cooling tower was 79.477 kW with a maximum of 139.413 kW. Although most of the samples in the prediction performance of the NARX model were accurate from Fig. 8, these outliers result in significant errors that is demonstrated by the goodness of fit, where the NARX model could not offer much improvement and performed slightly worse as compared to semiphysical model for chiller. The total number of outliers in the performance of the NARX model was 49, 34, and 26 for AHU, chiller and cooling tower, respectively. AHU model experiences the most number of outliers in performance; this might be due to noise propagation manifesting in the batch training data of the NARX model. The proposed dissimilarity-driven ensemble model presented the best accuracy from Table 4 and the smallest number of outliers for all three subsystems, as shown in Fig. 9 c. It can be seen from the box plot that the 75th percentile of IQR was below 200 kW with a maximum below 452 kW for AHU and chiller, and for the cooling tower 75th percentile of IQR was at 55.960 kW with a maximum of 66.689 kW, indicating better consistency in performance as compared to other two models. This is because the proposed model is able to effectively remove outliers in its ensemble prediction that the NARX model experiences. The total number of outliers in the performance of the dissimilarity-driven ensemble model was 24, 23, and 14 for AHU, chiller and cooling tower, respectively. The ensemble prediction from the dissimilarity-driven ensemble model relies mostly on NARX model prediction since most of the predictions from the NARX model were accurate. The dissimilarity-driven ensemble model was able to capture the instances when the predictions from the NARX model were not accurate, where it relied more on semiphysical model for final ensemble prediction. Overall, there was up to 51.020% reduction in number of outliers when compared to the NARX model. Removing these outlines in the final prediction improves the model's reliability and reduces errors as demonstrated via goodness of fit, where the proposed model provided improvements up to 74.661% from Table 4. 4.4 Computational load comparison The online computational performance with the proposed DEMRTO approach was also assessed. The computational load was calculated by capturing the time required for batch training of the NARX model and the optimization approach's search time. The computational load with the proposed approach was reasonable. The average time required for the batch training of the dissimilarity-driven ensemble model was 5.903 s, and the average search time required by the DEMRTO approach was 11.425 s. This is a manageable computational load considering the 1-h optimization frequency. This is due to the selection of a semiphysical model and systematic and simple construction of the NARX model. Therefore, with low computational load and potential emission reduction, the proposed DEMRTO approach can be reckoned as a practical choice for application with large-scale building HVAC systems. 5 Discussion and application issues To implement the proposed approach, first operating setpoints of building HVAC systems that influence the system's energy performance need to be identified. The HVAC system optimization problem will incorporate these setpoints as decision variables. The 4 setpoints, supply air temperature T s a , the chilled water supply temperature at primary T c h s , 1 , the chilled water supply temperature at secondary T c h s , 2 and the condenser water supply temperature T c w s , were considered as decision variables in this study. Then a dissimilarity-driven ensemble model of the system is needed that would define the relationship between the decision variables and the operating cost, where the total power use was used as a cost function in this study. The setting up dissimilarity-driven ensemble model can be divided into two tasks, (1) setting up semiphysical model and (2) setting up batch trained NARX model. The semiphysical model was selected as a generalized model to provide consistent performance. However, these models normally need parameter identification for the model calibration that is carried out offline. The model parameter identification can be carried out using GA. The parameter identification was set up as an optimization problem to search the model parameter that will minimize the MSE between measured or manufacturer's data and model outputs. The NARX model was constructed as an accurate model for major subsystems and is batch trained online to enhance its robustness. The internal architecture of the NARX model used was fairly simple, with 1 input layer, 1 hidden layer and 1 output layer. The number of neurons in the hidden layer needs to be selected using tried and error method to minimize the MSE. To capture system dynamics, the lag space of the NARX models can be calibrated using the Lipschitz quotients method. Furthermore, the training of the NARX model can be set up using the Bayesian regularization-backpropagation. These semiphyical and NARX models can be combined using the proposed dissimilarity-driven boosting technique to take advantage of both models. In practical application, these modelling tasks would require HVAC subsystem data. With the wide use of building energy management system (BEMS), required data can be easily collected. When semiphysical and NARX models are constructed and combined with the dissimilarity-driven boosting technique, the ensemble model is ready for real-time application with the optimization problem. It should be noted since the size sliding window used for batch training is 24 h. Initially, only semiphyical model will be used in the optimization problem for the first 24 h. The case study considered in this study tested the proposed DEMRTO approach for energy performance and accuracy under high diversity of weather and load conditions. It was demonstrated that the DEMRTO approach could capture the varying load conditions and system dynamics while maintaining a reasonable online computational load. Overall, the DEMRTO approach provides reliability in decision-making by ensuring accurate and consistent online prediction performance with the dissimilarity-driven ensemble model, leading to substantial energy saving and reduced associated emissions. Overall, the proposed DEMRTO approach provided 22.986% improved energy performance compared to the MRTO approach when comparing the energy saving offered by both approaches. The energy savings and improvements are weighty, considering that they are achieved without any hardware investment. It is important to note that these results are only from simulation analysis and experimental validation and implementation will pose further challenges and impact both approaches' energy performance. Implementing the proposed DEMRTO approach would not be expensive. It could be integrated into existing BEMS with no hardwire changes; however, it requires expertise to carry out the model development tasks and optimization setup. Since the model needs to be recalibrated for different HVAC system sizes and configurations and for different building functions. Furthermore, although the DEMRTO approach successfully captured the load variations and system dynamics and improved the optimization performance, this study's scope. However, the DEMRTO approach relies on the measurement data streaming from sensors, and there is an inherent problem in using sensory data. In reality, some degree of uncertainty is associated with measurement data, and generally basic smoothing methods are used to reduce the effect of measurement uncertainty. However, these measurement uncertainties can reduce model accuracy and decision-making reliability, which would affect energy performance. Therefore, future work will take account of measurement uncertainties to improve the robustness of the DEMRTO approach and experimental validation. In the following phase of the study, measurement data from the building will be analyzed, and measurement uncertainty will be quantified. The proposed DEMRTO approach will be tested against quantified measurement uncertainty, and a data fusion approach will be developed to reduce the uncertainty associated with measurements. Furthermore, other subsystems of a complex HVAC system, such as boiler, thermal storage, etc., will be considered in the subsequent phases to complete the dissimilarity-driven ensemble models' library. 6 Conclusion This paper presents an MRTO approach that incorporates the dissimilarity-driven ensemble model for accuracy in prediction performance and reliability in decision-making with real-time optimization for application with HVAC systems. The proposed approach was examined under three weather conditions to judge the reliability of the DEMRTO approach, and the results were compared with conventional control approaches to evaluate its performance. It was demonstrated that. \u2022 The proposed DEMRTO approach can provide improved energy performance when compared with the MRTO approach. Around 2.785% more energy savings were possible compared with the MRTO approach. This was due to the model accuracy used for the synthesis of the DEMRTO approach. Compared with the benchmark case, i.e. FSP approach, up to 11.085% energy savings were possible. This reduction in energy use also translates into a significant reduction in CO2 emissions, i.e. up to 204 ton of reduction in emissions over a month as compared to FSP approach. \u2022 NARX model provides no major improvement when compared with the semiphysical model in the aspect of accuracy. In contrast, the dissimilarity-driven ensemble model provided accurate online prediction performance. The dissimilarity-driven ensemble model provided up to 74.661% improvement in accuracy as compared to the semiphysical model. \u2022 The proposed approach relies on the measurement data streaming from sensors. In practical applications, there is some degree of uncertainty associated with the measurement data that can reduce the performance of the DEMRTO approach. It is intended to extend our simulation-based study to experimental testing with the robustness enhancement of the DEMRTO approach against the measurement uncertainties. Also, performance models of other subsystems of the complex HVAC system will be developed using the framework of the proposed modelling technique.

        "dc:description": "Model-based real-time optimization (MRTO) is proven as an effective tool that can capture the complex dynamics of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems and improve its energy performance. Despite the energy benefits offered by MRTO, these approaches are rarely implemented in actual buildings. This is due to the reason that these approaches are very difficult to implement because they require the synthesis of a reliable and accurate performance model of the system. The reliability of decision-making with MRTO is directly related to the accuracy of these performance models. In addition, the model has to be computationally efficient for practical implementation. The development of such a model requires the most effort and is a major challenge in the implementation of MRTO. Several HVAC performance models are already available in the literature, and these can be classified as semiphysical models and data-driven models. The semiphysical models are generalized models with simplification assumptions that can provide consistent performance, however, with reduced accuracy. Contrastingly, the data-driven models can offer better accuracy; however, they lack robustness in terms of operational ranges. These factors affect the energy performance of MRTO, and an improper parametrized model could result in performance that is even worse than the conventional fixed setpoint or rule-based approaches. A dissimilarity-driven ensemble model-based real-time optimization (DEMRTO) approach is presented in this study that incorporates a dissimilarity-driven ensemble model in the framework of real-time optimization. The dissimilarity-driven ensemble model combines semiphysical models and data-driven models in a systematic manner to use one's strengths to address others' weaknesses, rather than developing a new form of a model. The performance of the proposed integrated approach was examined using case studies over three weather seasons in Hong Kong. The results showed as compared to the fixed setpoint approach the DEMRTO approach can provide significant energy savings up to 11.085% setpoint, and around 2.785% reduction in energy use as compared with the conventional MRTO approach. It was demonstrated that the proposed approach can capture diversity in load conditions and provide consistency in model prediction to improve reliability in decision-making with real-time optimization.",
