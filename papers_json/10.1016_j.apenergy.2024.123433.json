Department of Mathematics and Industrial Engineering, Polytechnique Montreal Canada Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) are energy-intensive systems that greatly contribute to peak demand, which can cause stability and reliability issues in the grid. The use of adaptive smart temperature controllers combined with demand response programs play an important role in addressing this challenge. However, deploying such controllers is difficult, mainly due to the need for detailed models of buildings which can be expensive to acquire. This work proposes a general purpose approach to alleviate this problem through the use of continuous-time neural differential equations models to predict the temperature and HVAC power usage. A fully data-driven approach is used to train the models, thus requiring no prior knowledge about buildings apart from metering data. Therefore, this approach is easily adaptable to different buildings. Furthermore, we show that we can adapt such models to incorporate high-level prior knowledge about building physics to further enhance their efficiency and interpretability. A planning algorithm embedded in an MPC framework is designed to control the temperature setpoint to limit the HVAC power consumption and increase eligibility to a demand response program. Extensive empirical tests are conducted on simulation and real data to assess each model\u2019s performance. The experiments show that continuous-time models are more sample-efficient and robust to missing and irregular observations. Our experiments also reveal that for the same level of planning accuracy, continuous-time models require fewer samples than their discrete-time counterparts when adjusting temperature setpoints to lower power consumption during demand response events.

The electrification of many sectors, including buildings\u2019 heating and cooling systems, puts enormous strain on the electric grid. At peak hours, when demand is the highest, grid operators need to carefully balance supply and demand to avoid power outages. Demand Response (DR) programs provide essential demand flexibility for the operation of electric grids. These programs intend to encourage building occupants to reduce their electricity consumption at peak times in response to dynamic-based rates or other forms of financial incentives [1]. HVAC systems have the potential to significantly reduce peak energy demand by shaving off the peaks in demand curves. This is possible because, unlike many other types of loads, HVAC systems are widespread and can be controlled without a direct impact on the occupants\u2019 comfort. In buildings across North America, HVAC systems account for 40% of the energy consumption, presenting a significant opportunity for impactful energy management strategies [2]. However, buildings have complex and changing dynamics, making the problem of developing efficient HVAC controllers challenging. The energy consumed by HVAC systems is largely driven by indoor temperature setpoints. Classically, a fixed setpoint is chosen by the occupants and tracked by a Rule-Based Controller (RBC). In the past years, many works have focused on improving the control of HVAC systems, mainly through Model Predictive Control (MPC) [3\u20135] and Reinforcement Learning (RL) [6\u20138]. These methods can balance the comfort of occupants and energy conservation objectives, which enables DR implementation. However, to achieve energy savings, most works focus on optimizing the internal behavior of HVAC systems by taking actions directly on the fans and coils [7\u201310]. In this work, actions are taken at a higher level. Occupants are allowed to define comfort temperature intervals to enhance energy conservation [11\u201313]. The objective is to plan for the best temperature setpoints to maximize thermal comfort while satisfying a maximum power constraint during peak hours. As opposed to other approaches requiring low level access to the inner workings of an HVAC system, our work only uses high-level metering data on the total HVAC power consumption and indoor temperatures, thereby increasing its applicability. By optimizing setpoints directly, our approach is also capable of working in tandem with existing low-level controllers already in place, further increasing energy conservation and DR participation. Previous works have considered changing temperature setpoints to control the HVAC\u2019s consumption [12]. For instance, [14] used MPC to change the indoor temperature setpoints to minimize electricity costs under real-time pricing programs. In [15] authors assess the impact of temperature setpoint changes on power consumption during DR events. They compare MPC and RBC and show that MPC can lead to two to three times more energy savings during DR events compared to RBC. In [16], Li et al. used model-free RL to limit the energy consumption of a residential house during DR events. They act on several appliances and consider comfort intervals to lower the HVAC\u2019s consumption. One major difference with our work is that the previous studies aim at lowering the energy consumption during DR events or balancing energy usage and comfort, whereas in this work we consider a hard constraint on the maximum energy usage. Using a maximum energy constraint prioritizes energy reduction over comfort during peak periods and provides guarantees about energy savings. While focusing primarily on energy savings, our framework also includes temperature comfort intervals to keep the indoor temperature within reasonable comfort bounds defined by the user. To build intelligent temperature controllers, one must understand the effect of temperature setpoint changes on the HVAC power consumption and the indoor temperature. This can be achieved with model-free RL, where an agent learns the effect of its actions by interacting with its environment. The long-term effects of the actions are captured by a value function that evaluates how good each state of the environment is, based on a reward signal describing the task to achieve. This approach works well in practice, as shown in [7]. However, at the early stages of the learning process, the agent takes random actions that prevent its use in a real system. The agent must be pre-trained on a simulator of the building before a real-world implementation. The development of accurate simulator is resource-intensive and time-consuming, which hinders the widespread of this approach [17]. In addition, enforcing hard constraints with model-free RL is challenging and does not suit DR events with hard constraints on the maximum power available [17,18]. In this work, we consider a model-based approach in which a prediction model is used to plan for the best temperature setpoints such that power consumption are within the limits dictated by the DR events. We investigate the performances of continuous-time and physics-informed prediction models both in terms of predictive power and in terms of the quality of the setpoints they produce when used for planning. Continuous-time models, mostly based on neural differential equations have gained much attention lately but to the best of our knowledge, they have not been applied for forecasting and controlling the temperature in buildings. By focusing on model-based planning controllers, we can enforce a hard inequality constraint on the amount of power being used given sufficiently accurate models. The different existing types of models and controllers are further described in Sections 1.1 and 1.2. 1.1 Overview of buildings modeling There are four main types of models: white-box, black-box, grey-box, and Physics Informed (PI) or structured models [19,20]. White-box models explicitly define the equations governing the thermal dynamics of a building. These models require an accurate knowledge of the building\u2019s architecture and materials, but are accurate and generalize well to different operation regimes. Furthermore, such models tend to be more interpretable and lend themselves more easily to verification. Black-box models, on the other hand, are fully data-driven and make no physics-related structural assumption in the modeling exercise. These models are accurate but may require a large amount of data and do not generalize well outside of the training dataset [21]. Grey-box models mitigate the disadvantages of both white and black-box models. They consist of simplified white-box models whose parameters are tuned on data. These models need less data compared to black-box models and their white-box structure yields better generalizability. Similarly, PI models include prior knowledge about the system. However, grey-box models start from a white-box model and simplify it whereas PI models start from a black-box model and add structure and constraints to encode physical laws. The framework of Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) introduced by [22] adds a physical meaning to the NN-based black box models. PINNs have been used to model the thermal behavior of buildings in [23,24]. In the same spirit, [25,26] developed structured models satisfying the energy conservation law to learn the thermal dynamics of buildings. As highlighted in [27], PI models are increasingly considered because their physics-based structure may increase the interpretability of the results compared to black box models. The interpretation of residual networks as an Euler discretization of an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) made Chen et al. [28] formulate a class of continuous-time models called Neural ODEs (NODE). NODE are black-box models, in which a NN is used to learn the vector field describing the dynamics of the system. Given an initial condition, one can integrate this vector field to compute the evolution of the system in continuous-time. Works such as [29\u201331] have investigated the idea of continuous-time models, showing that they help handle irregular and missing data, and can sometimes outperform discrete models in discrete-time settings. Indeed, physical systems evolve according to an underlying continuous process, which may be better captured by a continuous-time model. In particular, Kidger et al. [32\u201334] studied Controlled Differential Equations (CDE), which can be interpreted as the continuous counterpart of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). CDEs are a generalization of ODEs in which the vector field depends on a driver, or control, signal. CDEs suit the control framework perfectly because of the direct way they have to express the effect of controls on the system\u2019s evolution. CDEs are described in depth in [35], and results in [32\u201334] demonstrate their performances on modeling physical systems and long time-series, compared to NODE and discrete-time models. Physical laws are often expressed as differential equations. Thus, PI models are straightforward to design using continuous-time methods. For instance, in [29], physics constraints are imposed in the structure of the models using regularization terms in the objective function. In [36], a Lagrangian formulation is used to ensure that the system satisfies the energy conservation law. This can also be achieved using a Hamiltonian formulation, such as in [37] to model the thermal dynamics of an apartment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only application of NODE-like models to learning the thermal dynamics of a building. Their formulation of the problem of thermal dynamics is simple as they consider a structure of differential equations that assumes linear heat exchanges. As opposed to our work, they do not use the neural differential equation to build a prediction model for power usage or a temperature controller. They consider the HVAC power and heat gains or losses as input to the model and predict the indoor temperature evolution 72 h ahead. One of the key findings of their work is that adding a structure to the model mitigates compounding errors and helps with long-term predictions. 1.2 Model-based temperature control in buildings The ultimate objective of prediction models is to inform decisions. As discussed in this section, the above-mentioned models can be used in MPC algorithms [4] or in model-based RL algorithms [38,39]. As highlighted in [17], model-based RL has not been used as much as model-free RL for building control. This was explained by the better performances of model-free RL, but the recent improvements of model-based RL in other applications may change this trend [39]. To benefit from the large amount of data available, data-driven models such as grey-box and PI models are increasingly used. Grey-box models are often considered linear for simplicity [19]. For instance, the most widely used type of grey-box model for buildings is the Resistance Capacitance (RC) model [19]. Linear models are convenient because when used with MPC, they yield linear or quadratic programs that are easy to solve. Many works have used this approach [9,10,40,41]. However, heat exchanges are highly nonlinear phenomena, and require nonlinear models to be represented accurately [42]. Black-box models can handle nonlinearities. Works such as [43,44] used RNN and regression trees for load forecasting in buildings. When used with MPC, nonlinear models yield complex and often nonconvex optimization problems. In addition, MPC uses re-planning to mitigate prediction errors, which can be computationally challenging to carry over a small time period. Algorithms such as sequential least-squares programming or gradient-based algorithms are used to solve, at least locally, the optimization problem and have proven to work well with MPC [10,45]. However Schubnel et al. [46] show that nonlinear models have a better prediction accuracy than linear models, but do not perform better when used for planning. This result may be explained by the lack of physical meaning in fully data-driven black-box models [25], and motivates the use of PI models. Historically, the control of HVAC systems has been approached in a discrete-time setting. Buildings are represented using discrete models that can predict the system\u2019s next state based on its previous state and some inputs. These models are typically presented as State Space Models (SSM) [9,25,47]. SSM are suited for MPC due to their recursive nature which can be incorporated as a constraint in an optimization problem to represent the system\u2019s dynamics. Recent advancements have introduced deep learning adaptations of SSM, where an RNN is employed to maintain the system\u2019s state and calculate the next state using specific inputs [48,49]. In addition, buildings are partially observable environments and using a latent space has proven useful to deal with partial observability [38]. Constructing a latent space requires parsing lags of previous observations. Although a discrete-time setting is appropriate for planning, it may not suit the parsing of metered data that are often irregularly sampled and incomplete. 1.3 Contributions of this work We propose a new class of continuous-time and structured SSM to capture the thermal dynamics of buildings. These models are built using CDEs, and are fully differentiable, allowing gradient-based algorithms to be used both for learning and planning on control tasks. To cope with partial observability, predictions are made in a latent space, through an encoder\u2013decoder structure. Continuous-time components are used both for predictions in the latent space and as an encoder to better cope with missing data and partial observability. The proposed continuous-time models are compared to their discrete-time counterparts in prediction tasks on simulated and real-world data. We then investigate their properties when used to control temperature setpoints, while ensuring comfort and participation in DR events. We evaluate the quality of each model on these five criteria: 1. Prediction accuracy over different horizons. 2. Robustness to missing observations. 3. Robustness to irregular observations. 4. Amount of data needed to train the model. 5. Ability to be used for planning. The main contributions of this work are: 1. The development of continuous-time models based on neural differential equations and state space models to model the thermal dynamics of buildings. A CDE formulation, Physics Informed Structures, and Continuous Latent Space Encoders are considered to improve the prediction accuracy and control performances. 2. The development of a gradient-based control algorithm embedding any of the developed prediction models to control the indoor temperature under a maximum power constraint. This control algorithm is made to enhance demand response participation. Using a constraint on the maximum power consumption prioritizes energy savings during peak hours. The use of comfort intervals instead of setpoints ensures user comfort while promoting energy conservation. 3. The comparison of discrete-time and continuous-time state space models on both prediction and control tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work investigating continuous-time state space models for modeling and controlling the thermal dynamics of buildings. In Sections 2 and 3, we will present in detail the models as well as the control task and algorithms. In Sections 4 and 5, we present the results of our tests, before discussing the results and further works in Section 6. 2 Prediction models In this section, we build models to predict the temperature and HVAC power usage of a thermal zone. This thermal zone may represent an entire building, or be part of a larger structure. A thermal zone is partially observable, and we denote z its latent state. The state is influenced by actions a and disturbances d . Actions relate to the HVAC system\u2019s actuators while disturbances, such as the weather, are observable but uncontrollable phenomena impacting the zone\u2019s state. 2.1 Discrete-time models Using a discrete-time setting, the evolution of the state is given by the following SSM formulation: (1) z t + 1 = f θ ( z t , a t , d t ) (2) s t + 1 = g θ ( z t + 1 ) (3) z 0 = h θ ( s − 1 , \u2026 s − n ) where f θ is the thermal dynamics of the zone. h θ encodes the n previous states in the initial latent state z 0 , and g θ decodes a latent state to the observable space. Eqs. (1) and (2) may be applied recursively for multiple-step forecasts. This type of model has no particular structure and is fully data-driven. Its simplicity and accuracy make it widely used in practice [9,25,48]. It serves as a strong baseline for the continuous-time models introduced in this work. In our implementation, the function f θ is a RNN whose internal state is z t . The encoder h θ is an RNN used in a many-to-one setting. The decoder g θ is a feedforward NN. The weights θ are learned jointly to minimize the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between predicted states s and true states s ̄ over a horizon of H steps: (4) L ( θ ) = ∑ t = 1 H \u2016 s ̄ t − s t \u2016 2 2 . The prediction horizon is determined based on the problem to solve, as discussed in Section 4. 2.2 Continuous-time models 2.2.1 Controlled differential equations In a continuous-time setting, the evolution of the latent state z may be expressed using the ODE: (5) d z d t = ϕ θ ( z ( t ) ) (6) z ( t 0 ) = h θ ( s ( t − 1 ) , \u2026 , s ( t − n ) ) . Here the function ϕ θ represents the derivative of the latent state. Given an initial condition, one can compute the evolution of the latent state by integrating ϕ θ . Using the operator o d e i n t to integrate and save the values of z at different times, we have: (7) z ( t 1 ) , z ( t 2 ) , \u2026 z ( t H ) = odeint ( ϕ θ , z ( t 0 ) ) . In Eq. (7), the future latent states are determined entirely by the initial condition z ( t 0 ) and the dynamics ϕ θ . However, we could have prior information about the evolution of the system, such as the actions or the disturbances, that we would like to leverage. To integrate ϕ θ with respect to actions and disturbances, we need to formulate the problem as a CDE: (8) z ( T ) = z ( t 0 ) + ∫ 0 T ϕ ( z ( t ) ) d X ( t ) , where X is the driver, concatenating the actions a and disturbances d . The integral (8) is a Riemann\u2013Stieltjes integral [35,50]. If one sees the integral as the area under the curve of ϕ θ approximated by rectangles, integrating with respect to d X and not d t weighs the area of the rectangles according to the driver\u2019s value. This formulation allows to adjust the integration based on prior information about the system\u2019s evolution. If X is differentiable with respect to time, one can write d X = d X d t d t and express the CDE as a Riemann integral: (9) z ( T ) = z ( t 0 ) + ∫ 0 T ϕ ( z ( t ) ) d X d t d t . One can therefore approximate a CDE with an ODE whose vector field is parametrized by the driver ϕ ̃ ( z ( t ) , X ( t ) ) ≈ ϕ ( z ( t ) ) d X d t . The formulation of CDEs as parametrized ODEs is widely used in practice [29]. However, as stated in [35], every parametrized ODE can be formulated as a CDE, but the converse is false. Using a CDE formulation might result in a better approximation of the true dynamics in some cases. Since the underlying process of the thermal dynamics of buildings is continuous, one can expect CDEs to capture the dynamics better than their discrete counterpart. We refer the readers to [32\u201335] for more details about CDE. 2.2.2 CDEs as continuous state space models In a continuous-time setting, consider the parametrized ODE: (10) d z d t = ϕ ̃ θ ( z ( t ) ; a ( t ) , d ( t ) ) (11) z ( t 0 ) = h θ ( s ( t − 1 ) , \u2026 , s ( t − n ) ) . where the vector field is parametrized by a ( t ) and d ( t ) . Given an initial condition, future latent states are given by: (12) z ( t 1 ) , z ( t 2 ) , \u2026 , z ( t H ) = odeint ( ϕ ̃ θ , z ( t 0 ) , a ( t 1 ) , \u2026 , a ( t H ) , d ( t 1 ) , \u2026 , s ( t H ) ) . A decoder g θ can then be used to compute the state s ( t i ) given the corresponding latent state z ( t i ) , for i = 1 , \u2026 , H (13) s ( t i ) = g θ ( z ( t i ) ) . Note that t 1 , \u2026 , t H may be irregularly spaced. Eqs. (10), (11), (12) and (13) form a continuous SSM, referred to as a Latent NODE model or LNODE. As for discrete models, the encoder and decoder are implemented using an RNN and a feedforward NN respectively. The vector fields ϕ θ and ϕ θ ̃ are a feedforward NN. Parameters θ are learned jointly to minimize the MSE loss (4). Switching ϕ ̃ θ for ϕ θ in Eq. (10) of the continuous SSM replace the parametrized ODE formulation by a CDE. We thus refer to such a model as a CDE. The functioning of continuous SSM is illustrated in Fig. 1. Discrete driver values are interpolated in a continuous signal used to integrate the vector field. The computation is in continuous-time and the resulting trajectory may be evaluated at given timesteps to output the state values. The key components of each model are summarized in Table 1. 2.2.3 Continuous encoder One expected advantage of continuous-time over discrete-time models is the ability of continuous-time to handle irregularly sampled data. In buildings, sensors may not take measures with a fixed interval but only store values when a change is observed. This creates irregularly sampled lags of observations. We propose a continuous encoder based on an RNN cell whose internal state evolves continuously between observations, as previously proposed by [30,31]. This Continuous Encoder (CE), further details in Algorithm 1, may be used in place of the discrete-time encoder h along with discrete-time or continuous-time prediction models. 2.3 Structured state space models In this section, we aim to add a structure to the SSM. Consider that the state of the thermal zone is given by its indoor temperature T i n and by the HVAC power consumption P : (14) s ( t ) = P ( t ) T i n ( t ) . Note that P and T i n depend on many parameters. For simplicity, we omit these dependencies and write them as functions of time only. The evolution of T i n is given by the energy conservation law: (15) C p d T i n d t = η ( t ) P ( t ) + Q ( t ) , where C p is the thermal capacity of the zone, η ( t ) is the efficiency of the HVAC system and Q ( t ) accounts for heat exchanges with the outdoor and heat given off by appliances. One can reformulate Eq. (10) with the structure of Eq. (15): (16) d E ( t ) T i n ( t ) = P ( s ( t ) , a ( t ) , d ( t ) ) 1 C p Q ( s ( t ) , a ( t ) , d ( t ) ) + η ( t ) P ( s ( t ) , a ( t ) , d ( t ) ) d t , where E is the energy of the system. This equation embodies the law of energy conservation. To utilize it, one would need to operate in the observation space. Yet, as will be discussed in Section 4, using a latent state is important for accurate predictions. While latent spaces are dimensionless, we can keep the structure of Eq. (16) and learn two functions P θ and Q θ to represent P and Q respectively, as well as parameters C p and η : (17) d z E ( t ) z T i n ( t ) = P θ ( s ( t ) , a ( t ) , d ( t ) ) 1 C p Q θ ( s ( t ) , a ( t ) , d ( t ) ) + η ( t ) P θ ( s ( t ) , a ( t ) , d ( t ) ) d t , The latent space is divided into two parts: z E representing the HVAC energy consumption and z T i n representing the zone\u2019s temperature. As with the models presented above, the loss function (4) is used for training. Note that using the loss function (4) only constrains explicitly the learning of P θ . There is no constraint forcing Q θ to align with the non-HVAC power, leaving the function Q θ to predict the necessary components to achieve the desired temperature. Monitoring heat losses and power emitted by appliances is extremely challenging. That said, if one possesses such data, introducing an additional constraint to learn Q θ would enhance the energy conservation framework. Even without this data, we hypothesize the structure still has two advantages. First, a specific network is used to predict the power. Second, The power is a direct argument to the temperature function, preserving the sequence of causal events. We refer to the model (17) as a Structured LNODE. We also build a discrete-time counterpart. Let E t + 1 be the HVAC energy consumed between t and t + 1 . We have: (18) z E , t + 1 z T i n , t + 1 = P ̄ θ ( z t , a t , d t ) 1 C p ( η P ̄ θ ( z t , a t , d t ) + Q ̄ θ ( z t , a t , d t ) ) . We call this type of model a Structured SSM. All the models presented in this section are summarized in Table 1. 3 Control algorithm To evaluate the performances of the models at a control task, we consider DR event management where the controller has to adapt the indoor temperature setpoint to reduce the HVAC power consumption. Consider a discrete-time setting and let T u s e r , t be the temperature setpoint chosen by the user at time t . This setpoint represents the best temperature for comfort. The action the controller can take is a change to this setpoint, denoted δ t , so that at time t the temperature tracked by the HVAC system is T u s e r , t + δ t . We denote Δ the vector of setpoint changes over the horizon: Δ = [ δ 1 , \u2026 , δ H ] . In this work, we measure the thermal comfort using the deviation from the desired setpoint temperature T u s e r , t but note that many other metrics for thermal comfort exist [51]. During a DR event, a maximum power constraint must be satisfied to limit the building\u2019s consumption. In this study, we assume that the HVAC system is the only controllable load. We suppose the building\u2019s total power constraint is translated to a maximum P t m a x for the HVAC power consumption. To choose P t m a x , one can analyze the percentage of the HVAC consumption compared to the entire building\u2019s consumption. Note that in a discrete-time setting, the power is integrated per timestep. We define the optimal actions as the solutions to the following optimization problem: (19) minimize Δ ∑ t = 1 H T u s e r , t − T i n , t 2 (20) s.t. s t + 1 = F s t , δ t , d t , ∀ t (21) m ≤ δ t ≤ M , ∀ t (22) P t ≤ P t m a x , ∀ t where the function F in (20) refers to one of the models\u2019 dynamics presented in Section 2. Parameters m and M are the minimum and maximum setpoint changes allowed by the user. Note that P t m a x = ∞ outside of DR event periods, Δ = 0 is the optimal solution and no actions are needed. The problem is non-trivial during DR events. In the following, we present two methods to solve this problem. 3.1 Shooting controller The first approach transforms the problem into an unconstrained problem that can be solved using single shooting. Suppose we have access to a prediction model that gives the disturbances d 1 , \u2026 d H . From the observation of the system at t = 0 , we can compute the next states by recursively applying the dynamics F . Recall that the state is composed of the temperature and the power consumption (cf Eq. (14)). The constraint (20) can be transformed into an implicit constraint. In addition, we relaxed the constraint (22) using a l o g -barrier penalty function. The problem becomes: (23) minimize Δ ∑ t = 1 H T u s e r , t − T i n , t ( z t − 1 , δ t − 1 , d t − 1 ) 2 + s o f t p l u s ln P t m a x − P t ( z t − 1 , δ t − 1 , d t − 1 ) (24) s.t. z 0 = g ( s − 1 , \u2026 s − n ) (25) m ≤ δ t ≤ M , ∀ t . Note that the use of a s o f t p l u s function to create a differentiable approximation of a step function. In theory, iteration of constraint penalty terms of the form μ k ln P t m a x − P with μ k → 0 are guaranteed to lead to a feasible solution [52]. In practice, however, we found that for this particular problem, the problem formulation (23) works better and requires less computation. The prediction models are all fully differentiable and this problem can be solved using projected gradient descent. The use of a l o g -barrier function requires starting the search from a feasible solution. Therefore, a pre-search is first performed to find feasible solution by forecasting the power consumption for some setpoint changes. If setting the lowest setpoint does not lead to a predicted power consumption below the constraint, we consider the problem infeasible and we set the setpoint to its lowest. At each new timestep, actions are re-planned. The control algorithm is summarized in Algorithm 2. 3.2 Rule based controller The second approach uses the prediction model to predict if the HVAC power consumption will exceed the maximum. If the forecasted power does not exceed the maximum, we set Δ = 0 . Otherwise, we set δ t = δ R B C , a pre-defined setpoint such that m ≤ δ R B C ≤ M , for all t throughout the DR event period. If the temperature setpoint is not changed at the current timestep, the process is repeated at the next timestep. However, once the temperature setpoint changes, the new setpoint is kept for the rest of the DR event. We refer to this strategy as RBC. If the problem is feasible, choosing δ R B C = m will likely be a feasible solution. This solution is found with a very low computational budget because we only need a few forward passes in the prediction model. However, the solution might result in a bigger temperature deviation compared to what is needed to satisfy the power constraint. We use the RBC controller as a baseline to assess the advantage of using a shooting controller that minimizes temperature deviations but requires more computation. RBC with setpoint schedules are often used because of their simplicity and effectiveness [15,53]. To provide a stronger baseline for the MPC, we leverage the prediction models to only trigger setpoint changes when needed. 4 Evaluation of the models prediction accuracy 4.1 Results on simulation data 4.1.1 Data collection and training procedure This section aims at assessing the prediction accuracy of the models. We first introduce how the data is collected and the training procedure. Two single-zone houses from the residential reference buildings developed by the Department of Energy (DOE) are used to collect data [54]. Two different climate zones are considered: the DOE climate zone 7 (very cold), and the DOE climate zone 2 (hot and humid). The houses are modeled using EnergyPlus and their insulation and HVAC sizing are adapted to the climate zone. Both a winter and a summer period are considered, as shown in Table 2. During the winter period, there is no cooling and a single heating setpoint is used. During the summer period, the cooling system is mostly used but a fixed heating setpoint guarantees a minimum level of comfort, especially at night when the outdoor temperature might get colder. The simulation time step is set to 15 min and the temperature setpoint varies randomly with an increment of 0 . 25 ° C , as described in Table 2. Note that a setpoint is constant for a minimum duration of 30 min and a maximum duration of 24 h . In the climate zone 2 cooling is required even during winter and we only consider the summer period. The prediction models are fed with lags of state observation and forecasts of the disturbances and actions taken by the temperature controller. Specifically: \u2022 state observation: HVAC power (cooling and heating) and house indoor temperature. \u2022 disturbances: \u2013 weather: air temperature (dry bulb), relative humidity, and direct normal irradiance. \u2013 calendar information: hour of the day and the day of the week. \u2022 action: cooling or heating temperature setpoint, depending on the period. The state observations, weather, and actions are standardized, and the calendar information is encoded in cyclical features using sine and cosine transformations. For simplicity, instead of building a prediction model, we consider having access to perfect weather forecasts. This is a reasonable assumption because we only work with short-term horizons on which weather forecast models are the most accurate [55,56]. For each model, a grid search is made to tune the model size and learning rate: \u2022 For discrete-time models: \u2013 learning rate: 0.003; 0.0003 \u2013 latent state size: 100; 150; 200; 250; 300 \u2022 For continuous-time models: \u2013 learning rate: 0.003; 0.0003 \u2013 latent state size: 50; 100; 200 \u2013 vector field depth: 1; 2 Stratified sampling is used to randomly sample training data representative of the entire training dataset. Before the start of the training, trajectories including lags of observation and prediction targets, are shuffled using a uniform distribution. The trajectories are then gathered in batches of 64 and picked to be fed to the model. Each training is done with 5 different simulation seeds. Models are trained to minimize the loss function (4) and the AdaBelief optimizer is used to update the model weights [57]. The amount of training data may vary but a validation set of 75 days is always used to monitor the learning. Early stopping is used to prevent overfitting if the performances do not increase after two consecutive validations, which occurs every 500 training steps. The maximum number of training steps is fixed at 8000. If the amount of training data exceeds the winter or summer period duration, the weather of another year at the same location is used to generate more data. The best configuration on the validation set is tested on a test set of 150 days to predict both the power and the temperature. The tests are deterministic and only performed once per configuration and training seed. The following sections present the prediction accuracy of each model in different settings. 4.1.2 Prediction on different horizons First, we compare the accuracy of HVAC power and indoor temperature predictions. Tests are first made for horizons of 2 h and 6 h on the data collected during winter in climate zone 2. The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) scores for each model and horizon are shown in Fig. 2. As illustrated in Fig. 5, there is no qualitative difference in the behavior of the models, and therefore, the mean score effectively reflects the accuracy of the models. For temperature forecasts, the models have a similar accuracy. The temperature setpoint is known beforehand, which makes the prediction task easier. We note however that all models are performing better than a baseline, shown in Figs. 2(c) and 2(f), that predicts the setpoint. This result is in part explained by a small difference of around 0 . 1 ° C between the temperature and its setpoint when the system is in a steady state, and also by the better performances of the prediction models in the period of transition between setpoints. Regarding power forecasts, continuous-time models tend to be more accurate than discrete ones. This difference is heightened when the amount of training data is reduced, as shown in Figs. 2(a) and 2(e), and when the prediction horizon lengthens, as shown in Fig. 2(f). The lesser performance of the NODE model, which operates in the observation space directly, highlights the importance of using a latent space. Among the continuous and discrete models, we do not observe any advantage of using structured models or continuous encoders. However, when there is less training data available, we notice an advantage of using the CDE formulation over the LNODE formulation, as shown especially in Figs. 2(a). Note that both CDE and LNODE are integrated using the same adaptive step-size Dormand\u2013Prince integration scheme, the only difference is thus in the model\u2019s formulation. As shown in Fig. 4, the above observations are consistent with the ones made during summer periods. In climate zone 7, continuous-time models are more accurate than the discrete-time ones for HVAC power prediction, especially with 2.5 months of training data. As the quantity of training data increases the gap between discrete and continuous-time models narrows. In climate zone 2, both continuous and discrete-time models have similar accuracies. As shown in Fig. 3, the HVAC power consumption of the house in climate zone 2 during summer is smoother than the one in climate zone 7. This makes the power prediction task easier in climate zone 2 and reduces the difference between continuous-time and discrete-time models\u2019 accuracy. 4.1.3 Prediction with missing observations We test the robustness of the models to missing observations using the winter data of climate zone 7. A prediction horizon of two hours is considered, and we use the best configurations found above. We train and test the models on three datasets with 25%, 50%, and 75% chance of not observing either the power or the indoor temperature. Unobserved values are masked in the training, validation, and test datasets. Each training is done with 5 different seeds, and the trained models are tested on 10 different seeds. Results are presented in Fig. 7. We observe no clear advantage of using a structured model or a continuous encoder to cope with missing observations. We notice however that continuous-time models are more robust to missing observations for power forecasts than discrete models, especially when the missing data probability is 25% or 50%. Missing observations impact the quality of the initial latent state built by the encoder. Regardless of the encoder being used, continuous-time models can produce better predictions than discrete models. Since the temperature setpoint schedule is known, temperature forecasts are less sensitive to missing observations and we do not observe any clear difference between the models. 4.1.4 Predictions with irregularly sampled observations We test the models on a dataset with irregularly sampled observations collected during winter in climate zone 7. The time (in minutes) between observations is drawn from a Poisson distribution. The number of observations varies from one draw to the other, but the observation period cannot exceed 1 h and the minimum period between two observations is 1 min. The expectation of the Poisson\u2019s distribution is set to λ = 5 min , λ = 10 min and λ = 15 min . Note that in this setting, the discrete RNN encoder is also fed with the time between each observation. We consider 2 h ahead forecasts and use the best configurations found in Section 4.1.2. Each training is done with 5 different seeds, and the trained models are tested on 10 different seeds. Results are shown in Fig. 8. Regarding power predictions, we observe that the continuous-time models are less impacted by irregularly sampled observations than the discrete models when the mean duration between two observations is of 5 and 10 minutes. Interestingly, the performance of the LNODE and CE-LNODE, and SSM and CE-SSM are similar. There is no advantage to using a continuous encoder to parse the irregular observations compared to simply feeding the time between two observations to the discrete RNN encoder. The temperature predictions are less impacted by the irregular observation, all the models have close RMSE scores with less than 0 . 4 ° C difference. The scores are similar to the setting with regular observation (c.f. Fig. 2). This is because the temperature setpoints schedule is given to the prediction model. A good initial latent space is less important to predict the temperature than to predict the power usage. 4.2 Results on data collected on real buildings In this section, we use temperature data monitored in five different single-zone commercial buildings of about 5000 f t 2 . Each building is conditioned by a rooftop unit supplying outdoor air to the building. Heating systems each have a capacity of 210000 BTU/hour, and cooling systems have a capacity varying between 10 and 25 refrigeration tons. Buildings are located in different cities in Eastern Canada. The dataset contains the activation of heating and cooling systems, but not the power usage. Activation signals are given as observations to the models, and we train the prediction models to forecast the evolution of the temperature 2 h ahead. As in the previous section, temperature setpoint schedules and weather data are given as input to the models. Models are trained on 3 months of data collected from January to March. Tests are made on 2 months of data collected from October to December, as well as 2 months of data collected in April and May. The best model configurations found on the simulated results are used, and the training is done with 8 different seeds for each model. The average performance of the models is shown in Fig. 6. The results are close to the ones obtained on simulated data. As in the test with 3 months of training data (c.f. Fig. 2(a)), we observe better average performances of the continuous-time models than with discrete models on buildings 1, 3, and 5. This difference is narrower in buildings 2 and 4. As shown in Fig. 9, the difference in performance between buildings is explained by the difference in thermal inertia and HVAC sizing, which makes the temperature evolve more rapidly in the first three buildings. The graphs for all models showed similar trends and for simplicity, Fig. 9 displays only the results for the LNODE and SSM. Generally, all the models successfully capture the temperature trends. However, as shown in Fig. 9(c), both models miss the start of the heating system causing a sharp temperature increase. While this is not shown in the average score, this type of error is important when using the models for control. That being said, this error is not systematic, as shown in Figs. 9(a) and 9(d). 5 HVAC control for demand response events In this section, to test the control performances of the models, we consider the winter period for the house in the cold climate zone 7 (cf. Table 2). In parts of North America like Quebec, which rely on electricity for heating, the most significant strain on the power grid occurs during winter due to the cold weather [58]. As peak periods mostly happen in the morning and the evening, we define DR events between 7 pm and 10 pm to focus on the evening peaks. During a DR event, the house must reduce its power consumption. The only controllable load is the HVAC system so each event translates into a different maximum power constraint that may require actions from the controller. The temperature setpoint is first set to 21 ° C and setpoint changes range from − 3 ° C to + 2 ° C . The simulation is run from January 1st to February 28th with the test weather data that were not used during training and validation. To extensively evaluate the control algorithm, power constraints are imposed every day, requiring power reductions ranging from 0% to 50% of the maximum heating power. This broad spectrum of reductions is selected to assess the controllers\u2019 capacity to adapt the temperature for slight adjustments and significant decreases in the heating power. In total, the simulation contains 26 days where actions are required from the controller to satisfy the DR event. Among these 26 events, 4 events are unfeasible, meaning that the problem (19) does not have a solution. The controllers must choose the right setpoints to satisfy the maximum power constraint during the DR event while keeping the temperature the closest possible to 21 °C. Algorithm 2 is used to plan for the best setpoints. The simulation timestep is 15 min and replanning occurs every 30 min. We compare the results with the built-in EnergyPlus controller and two RBC that reduce the temperature by − 2 ° C and − 3 ° C respectively. Table 3 summarizes the results. The first column shows the percentage of timesteps where the power constraint was satisfied. If for one timestep the constraint is violated, we consider the controller failed at the event. The second and third columns show the number of events satisfied. To distinguish between the errors due to the predictions and the errors due to the control algorithm itself, we record the number of DR events satisfied in prediction during planning and the number of events actually satisfied. Prediction errors may lead to power constraint violation despite having predicted that the event will be satisfied. We also record the \u201cunnecessary actions\u201d that occur when the controller is changing the temperature but the power would have stayed below the maximum without any setpoint change, as shown by the power baseline results computed with the EnergyPlus built-in controller. The main observation is that the optimal setpoint changes found by the shooting controllers lead to power consumption really close to the maximum power. This makes the control algorithm sensible to prediction errors. This is illustrated by the big difference between DR events satisfied and satisfied in prediction for the SSM, Structured SSM, CE-SSM, LNODE and CDE in Table 3. In Fig. 11(b) the blue dotted line represents the predictions updated every 30 min. One may notice that in prediction the power is, when feasible, always maintained just below the maximum. However, as shown in Fig. 11(a) on January 12th a small prediction error results in a constraint violation. As illustrated in Fig. 12, prediction errors may be mitigated by introducing a slack to the constraint. For instance, we set a 8% slack on the maximum power to observe the effect on the control. This value was chosen to be a few percent more than the average percentage prediction error. Using a slack leads to 6 more DR events satisfied for the SSM and 10 more for the CDE and LNODE. This comes at the cost of sometimes taking unnecessary actions that affect the user\u2019s comfort. The mean temperature deviation from 21 ° C , computed on each day between 5 pm and 11 pm, quantifies the impact of the control on the user\u2019s comfort. Note that this score must be put in perspective with the number of DR events satisfied, the primary objective being to satisfy the power constraint. That said, we observe that the SSM with 8% slack and the RBC have the same number of events satisfied, but the SSM has a lower mean temperature deviation. The RBC with − 3 ° C action satisfies all the feasible events but has a high temperature deviation. Fig. 10 illustrates key behaviors of the different controllers. We notice in Figs. 10(a), 10(b) and 10(c) on the second day that the controllers can find pre-heating strategies that help reduce the impact on the user\u2019s comfort. When only a small effort is needed, as on the first day, the shooting controllers can slightly adjust the temperature to meet the power constraint whereas the RBC control makes a big temperature change. Fig. 13 shows the average computation time per iteration of gradient descent and the average computation time for the entire search. In general, discrete models require less computation because they do not require integrating a differential equations. We also note that the model complexity has a direct impact on the computation time. For instance, the best LNODE model has a vector field of one layer and 100 neurons while the vector field of the Structured LNODE has two layers of 200 neurons, which results in a five times slower computation time per iteration. 6 Discussion The experiments reveal that continuous-time models can accurately model the buildings\u2019 thermal dynamics and be used for planning if they are formulated as CDE or an LNODE. However, adding a structure to the model did not lead to better prediction accuracy. Previous works on NODE [29,59] have proven the advantage of passing prior knowledge about the system in the structure of the model. In our case, we believe the structure was not informative enough to provide an advantage to the model. In practice, having a model learn only from data and general physical laws like the energy conservation law is important because it reduces the amount of work needed to develop the models. In this context, the simple structure did not provide an advantage. An interesting future research direction will be to assess the amount of prior knowledge one needs to have on a system for structured models to be worthwhile. In partially observable environments like buildings, using a latent space is crucial to obtain good performances. A challenge that remains is to incorporate prior knowledge in a dimensionless latent space. Works such as [29] consider fully observable environments and do not use latent spaces. One approach, as done in this work and previously proposed in [25], is to write the dimensionless latent space equations with the same form as the original equations. However, this does not tell, for instance, how to inform the model about the thermal capacity of a part of the system. To build good initial latent states, the continuous encoders did not provide an advantage over RNN encoders in settings with missing and irregular observations. The works [30,31] present the advantage of continuous RNN over discrete ones in tasks such as interpolation and system identification of dynamical systems. However, in this work, we use the models in a slightly different context: encode a latent representation of the state. In this context, discrete RNN appear to work similarly to their continuous counterparts. That said, the GRU-ODE-Bayes model proposed in [31] uses a Bayesian approach to model the hidden state of the recurrent network. Further work to include a Bayesian approach to the models proposed here could significantly enhance the performances, especially in settings with missing and irregular observations. As suggested in [32\u201335], CDE is a natural formulation to account for control signals in the integration process. However, most works using neural differential equations are only using a parametrized ODE [29,37,59]. The experiments conducted in the work highlight the good behavior of CDE when used for planning. Our tests are limited to single-zone buildings. An interesting future research direction is to extend the approach to multi-zone buildings, for instance by augmenting the observations to include data from all zones. For large buildings, a distributed approach may also be used, with local controllers acting in every zone. Extensions to multi-zone buildings might be straightforward if zones are well insulated. However, if there is a strong thermal coupling between the zones, the controllers\u2019 interactions with their neighbors must be carefully accounted for. In this work, we mostly use simulated datasets for our experiments. Despite using EnergyPlus, a sophisticated simulation tool for buildings, discrepancies still arise when comparing these simulations to actual buildings. These differences are largely attributed to simplified representations of building geometries and heat transfer calculations, as well as uncertainties surrounding weather conditions and building occupancy. While in this study the models trained on simulated data are not meant for a direct transfer to real-world usage, we emphasize the importance of using real-world data for model training, as it more accurately reflects the complex behaviors of buildings. To improve the flexibility of our models, we initially limit our data inputs to minimal sensor information regarding the building\u2019s state. It is important to note that the integration of additional data into the model inputs, such as occupancy sensors and the monitoring of specific loads like lighting and appliances, can help to build a more informative latent state and significantly enhance the models\u2019 predictive performance. This is particularly true for real buildings where the dynamics are more complex. 7 Conclusion In this work, we develop continuous-time models based on CDE for prediction and control of the HVAC power and the temperature in buildings. The models are fully differentiable, allowing for gradient-based optimization methods to be used. A shooting algorithm is also proposed to leverage the prediction models and control HVAC power consumption through temperature setpoint actuators to enable DR participation. The continuous-time models are compared to their discrete counterparts at system identification tasks including different prediction horizons, training set sizes, and missing and irregularly sampled observations. The results show that continuous-time models have better average performances than discrete ones when trained with only 2.5 months of training data, and similar performances when trained with more data. In addition, continuous-time models are more robust to missing and irregular observations. However, the use of continuous encoder and structured models did not lead to better prediction accuracy. Interestingly, the CDE formulation leads to better prediction accuracy than the parametrized latent ODE formulation in a low training data regime. When used for control, both continuous and discrete models can effectively plan for the best temperature setpoints, balancing user comfort and power usage. A rule-based algorithm used with the prediction models allows to satisfy 22 out of 22 feasible DR events. The proposed shooting algorithm can satisfy 18 out of 22 DR events but can minimize the temperature setpoint deviation compared to a rule-based approach.

        "dc:description": "Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) are energy-intensive systems that greatly contribute to peak demand, which can cause stability and reliability issues in the grid. The use of adaptive smart temperature controllers combined with demand response programs play an important role in addressing this challenge. However, deploying such controllers is difficult, mainly due to the need for detailed models of buildings which can be expensive to acquire. This work proposes a general purpose approach to alleviate this problem through the use of continuous-time neural differential equations models to predict the temperature and HVAC power usage. A fully data-driven approach is used to train the models, thus requiring no prior knowledge about buildings apart from metering data. Therefore, this approach is easily adaptable to different buildings. Furthermore, we show that we can adapt such models to incorporate high-level prior knowledge about building physics to further enhance their efficiency and interpretability. A planning algorithm embedded in an MPC framework is designed to control the temperature setpoint to limit the HVAC power consumption and increase eligibility to a demand response program. Extensive empirical tests are conducted on simulation and real data to assess each model\u2019s performance. The experiments show that continuous-time models are more sample-efficient and robust to missing and irregular observations. Our experiments also reveal that for the same level of planning accuracy, continuous-time models require fewer samples than their discrete-time counterparts when adjusting temperature setpoints to lower power consumption during demand response events.",
