The selection of a suitable indoor temperature is a challenge to society, since its relationship with thermal comfort and energy consumption. The adaptive thermal comfort theory addresses this problem relating indoor with outdoor temperatures and based on that, defines temperature ranges. This paper defines a fuzzy logic-based methodology to assess the suitability of indoor adaptive temperature ranges proposed by existing regulations of the real thermal sensation of the occupants. For this purpose, the study suggests considering four indicators to evaluate the representativeness of different comfort ranges on the real preferences of the occupants. Based on that, four metrics are proposed for interpreting the needs of the occupants of a building and the changes required to the temperature ranges to satisfy such needs. To validate the proposed methodology, questionnaires on the thermal sensation of the occupants of office buildings considering three case studies (Mediterranean, Europe, ASHRAE) are used, showing the results obtained the representativeness of adaptive comfort ranges for such databases. The feasible introduction of this methodology in a conditioning systems would assist in decision making regarding energy efficiency, thermal comfort and a balance between them. Keywords Thermal Comfort Indoor Temperature Ranges Metrics Uncertainty Data availability The data that has been used is confidential. 1 Introduction People spend 60\u201390 % of their lives inside buildings [1], where they require comfortable indoor conditions with no adverse effects on health or the development of the activities carried. The operation of the buildings is equivalent to 40 % of the energy consumption [2], where HVAC systems are the main source of consumption, representing 50 % of the energy consumed [3]. For this reason, a series of directives has been developed, based on energy savings in buildings [4,5], whose main objective is to maintain acceptable conditions of thermal comfort, while reducing energy consumption [6] to reach the European Union objective of reducing gas emissions by 90 % by 2050 [7]. At present, many building control systems operate based on a set point temperature for the winter and summer seasons, with the aim of achieving a satisfactory comfort temperature for the majority of the occupants. Nevertheless, with the introduction of this method it is possible to reach extreme low or high temperatures, resulting in excessive energy consumption and an increase in the number of occupants in discomfort [8]. Although in recent years, efforts have been made to optimise temperature settings [9,10], energy efficiency in buildings has become a complex problem when it comes to achieving a balance with thermal comfort. To optimise both factors, it is first necessary to determine the comfort zone of the users of the buildings and, consequently, their thermal preferences and comfort requirements, in order to then integrate these comfort conditions into an energy and cost saving strategy. The introduction of temperature set points is based on the static model proposed by Fanger in 1967 [11]. In this model, two comfort indexes are defined: the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) and the Predicted Percentage of Dissatisfied (PPD). These indexes are obtained from the evaluation of indoor environment variables and personal parameters for a group of occupants, in the interior of climatic chambers with environmental conditions in steady state. The application of this model has been mainly associated with buildings with a mechanical cooling system, where it is possible to obtain static environmental conditions, given that when used in naturally ventilated buildings, the model tends to overestimate the discomfort of the occupants [12]. In 1973, in the work carried out by Nicol and Humphreys [13] suggests that occupants can adjust and acclimatize to a wider range of temperature and environmental variations. Following a number of field studies, the investigation showed that the occupants of naturally ventilated buildings are able to remain in a state of comfort in a wider range of indoor temperatures than the occupants of buildings with HVAC systems [14], establishing linear regression models where the indoor comfort temperature is represented as a function of the outdoor temperature. Since then, several studies have been carried out to validate this model, known as a dynamic model, demonstrating the feasibility in real environments where it is difficult to obtain steady-state conditions [15]. The static and dynamic models are accepted by international standards such as ISO 7730 [16], ASHRAE 55 [17] and EN 16798\u20131:2019 [18], providing bases for an effective control of the parameters with an effect on the occupants' comfort. Although in the models of thermal comfort it is assumed that providing mean environmental conditions preferred by a group of occupants is the best way of achieving a high percentage of occupants in comfort, in practice, the individual differences make it impossible to meet the needs of all the occupants [19]. This has led to studies on personalised comfort models which demonstrate the influence of seasonal, regional and cultural parameters over the thermal preferences of the occupants [20], obtaining models with significant energy savings. For this reason, the exploration of the analysis of comfort ranges is increasingly more relevant. In addition, at present, data management and analysis is put forward as a useful tool for the evaluation of thermal comfort parameters and the prediction of occupant behaviour. This recognises the feasibility of their multi-objective introduction in HVAC systems where the variables display highly variable and dynamic behaviour [21]. This set of techniques eases the selection of a comfortable indoor temperature according to with the individual preferences of the occupants. The objective of this study is to take a closer look at the analysis of the comfort zones proposed in the regulations and to establish a methodology able to define more efficient control models in HVAC systems. In order to achieve the objective of this research, the application of a prediction model of occupant\u2019s thermal comfort is proposed. This model is based on the temperature ranges proposed by the adaptive methodology, together with a possible modification of these, which should be studied and optimised at a future date. Similarly, this study aims to define a model which allows the following specific objectives to be met: \u2022 To carry out a study of the temperature ranges with the aim of defining effective decisions for the control of HVAC systems, according to the needs of the occupants. \u2022 To establish a new methodology for the evaluation of the comfort ranges, taking into account comfort and discomfort votes within and outside the ranges by making use of a broader set of evaluation metrics. \u2022 To address the uncertainty associated with the personal parameters involved in the evaluation of comfort, by selecting a suitable technique. \u2022 To explore the concept of adaptive comfort in order to determine if a wider range of acceptable indoor conditions could be adopted to evaluate the potential impact on occupant satisfaction and energy efficiency. \u2022 To simulate different temperature set points ranges scenarios with the aim of evaluate the feasibility of their real implementation in HVAC systems and their cost implication. And carry out modifications of comfort ranges in order to prioritise the wellbeing and satisfaction of the building occupants, while also looking to improve energy efficiency. This document is structured as follows: section 2 presents a review of thermal comfort and comfort ranges and how current studies address the uncertainty existing in the evaluation of thermal comfort. Section 3 describes the control model proposed in this study, explaining the set of tools considered with the aim of making an effective assessment of the thermal comfort of the model. It also sets out the three cases of use to which the proposed model is applied. Section 4 exposes the results obtained following the application of the proposed methodology and recommends a modification to the comfort ranges defined in the regulations, also discussing such results. Finally, section 5 presents the conclusions obtained and proposes a future line of research. 2 State of the art This section reviews the adaptive models and the uncertainty associated with these. Firstly, section \u201c2.1 Thermal comfort and temperature ranges\u201d sets out the temperature ranges used in the different types of building. Then, section \u201c2.2 Uncertainty in thermal comfort evaluation\u201d offers a review of the uncertainty associated with the limits of the temperature ranges and a set of studies to minimise this. 2.1 Thermal comfort and temperature ranges The dynamic approach of thermal comfort addresses the challenge of a comfortable indoor environment using the definition of an adaptive control algorithm, based on which a neutral indoor temperature would be established according to the outdoor temperature of the building. With this approach, the individual differences existing among the users of a building, and which influence their perception of the thermal environment, are addressed by means of the establishment of temperature ranges where most of individuals will feel in their thermal comfort zone. Standards such as EN 16798\u20131:2019 [18] and ASHRAE 55 [17] consider different comfort equations obtained from the mean thermal preferences of the occupants of a group of buildings without mechanical systems. These equations relate the indoor comfort temperature of the building to the mean outdoor temperature. Standard EN 16798\u20131:2019 uses the running mean temperature weighted exponentially (Trm), unlike the ASHRAE 55 standard which uses the outdoor monthly mean temperature (To). The current standards propose upper and lower temperature limits for the comfort equation. These define a zone in which comfortable conditions are estimated for most of the occupants of the building. Depending on their level of expectation for the indoor conditions, four different temperature ranges are proposed, called categories or classes. Category I is recommended for buildings whose occupants have a high level of expectation, only considered in those spaces occupied by people with a high level of sensitivity. Category II is recommended for normal levels of expectation and category III for moderate expectations. Category IV is reserved for those values outside the criteria established by the above categories and is only acceptable for limited periods of time. In addition, the different applicable standards contain a section that refers to the temperature limits established for mechanically heated and cooled buildings, defining values for the predicted mean vote and the associated predicted percentage of dissatisfied. In general, these ranges are mostly accepted, and few studies focus on their analysis or on their acceptance by the occupants during their everyday work. The relevance of the study of the temperature ranges lies in their relation, not only to the thermal comfort of the occupants, but also to the energy consumption, as a slight modification in the comfort range may imply a significant increase in energy consumption. Given the importance of this, a set of studies has been developed that propose modifications to the comfort ranges, with the aim of obtaining a higher degree of adjustment to the individual thermal preferences of the occupants. The work carried out by Arens et al. [22] addresses the analysis of the different thermal comfort ranges associated with each building category. The study concludes that there are no relevant differences between the three building categories, where category I does not provide higher ratios of acceptability by the occupants than category II or category III. In addition, it describes the differences with respect to the level of clothing or metabolic rate of the users of a building, implying a variation in the initially expected acceptability and resulting in a widening of the temperature ranges with respect to the conventional ranges proposed by the regulations. In addition, the study carried out by Suerich et al. [23] proposes a variation of the adaptive model, in which it is combined with the Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI). From this combination, a modification to the comfort equation is obtained to avoid possible overheating and overcooling in which excessive energy consumption takes place. Boerstra et al. [24] propose the incorporation of indoor temperature limit set points in the adaptive model developed in the ISSO 74 (2004) [25] standard. In this way, a hybrid comfort model is obtained for mechanically cooled buildings, limiting very high temperature values in the cooling season. This study was subsequently incorporated into the standard, resulting in the ISSO 74 (2014) standard [26] on thermal comfort inside buildings in the Netherlands. The methodology described in [27] proposes the introduction of different thermal comfort ranges and equations for the winter and summer seasons. The aim is to adapt the model to the true sensitivity of the occupants, while also demonstrating that the thermal preferences of the occupants of the buildings change throughout the year in relation to the weather, in comparison to the continuous equation and comfort ranges proposed in the traditional methodology. The study by Deng and Chen [28] develops a neuronal network to predict thermal comfort based on thermal sensation and the behaviour of the occupants, both in residential and non-residential environments. Thus, a set of comfort zones is obtained that differs from the proposal in ASHRAE 55 [17]. An evaluation of the predicted percentage of dissatisfied is also carried out in this study, identifying discrepancies with that proposed in the regulations. This fact is also demonstrated in field studies such as that of Karmann [29], which shows that 40 % of the surveyed occupants of an office building found themselves in a zone of thermal discomfort. This ratio is far higher than the 20 % specified in the ASHRAE 55 standard [17]. The series of studies mentioned above highlight that the different comfort ranges proposed in standards allows modifications with the aim of adjusting as far as possible to the real preferences of the occupants. This has led to the development of more efficient control models for the HVAC systems. 2.2 Uncertainty in thermal comfort evaluation The evaluation of thermal comfort involves a set of variables with a high degree of associated uncertainty, derived from the variability existing in the individual preferences of the occupants co-existing in the buildings. Similarly, in the zones close to the comfort ranges, there is a degree of discrepancy in the thermal sensation of the different occupants. At present, there are a large number of techniques used to assess indoor thermal comfort, including Artificial Intelligence (AI) which is put forward as an essential tool for modelling complex experiences and knowledge with a high degree of associated uncertainty [30]. In the last decade, a large number of artificial intelligence-based technologies have been developed in relation to the control of HVAC systems in order to achieve comfortable indoor conditions in buildings while controlling the energy consumption [31]. Fuzzy logic is an artificial intelligence technique which uses imprecise values in place of exact or fixed values, making it particularly useful for difficult-to-define variables [32]. It uses the concept of partial truth, that is, by analysing whether the value of one of the variables involved in the problem is completely \u201ctrue or false\u201d. It requires a modelling of these variables with the use of membership functions to define intermediate values or degrees of truth between the completely false values (0) and the completely true values (1). Furthermore, this methodology includes expert knowledge and establishes adequate relations between the input and output variables of the systems using control rules of the \u2018If-then\u2019 statement [33]. Due to this capacity for addressing the uncertainty inherent to the personal variables existing in the field of thermal comfort, fuzzy logic is an appropriate tool for making an approximation of the variable behaviour of the occupants of buildings [34]. This technique permits a simple representation of the thermal preferences of the occupants with the use of linguistic descriptions, offering a flexibility that has resulted in the different approaches found in the literature on thermal comfort. Several studies based on fuzzy logic propose the modification of the temperature set point in order to obtain a comfortable thermal environment inside the buildings, while also increasing energy savings. Following this methodology, in [20,35\u201337] the modification is proposed of the comfort temperature ranges in the ASHRAE 55 standard [17]. These modifications are established based on predictions about the thermal comfort of the occupants, made by a fuzzy control system which uses different parameters not considered in the standard as input variables, in order to demonstrate the influence of these on the degree of satisfaction of the occupants with the thermal environment. In addition, the studies [38\u201340] recommend that the modification of the limit indoor temperature set point is based on the PMV value. Multi-objective fuzzy models are proposed in these studies which define the temperature values of the buildings based on the PMV range [-0.5, 0.5]. In [41,42] operative temperature set point is modified as a function of the outdoor temperature of the building with the aim of reducing the energy consumption of the systems, obtaining energy savings for both models of more than 27 %. Other sets of studies on buildings with a mechanical conditioning system recommend the use of HVAC control models, modifying the internal variables of these, based on the decisions offered by the fuzzy logic. There is a subset among these studies that proposes the modification of these internal parameters with the aim of obtaining a comfortable indoor temperature. Papers [43\u201345] propose the modification of the parameters of the system, in order to establish different temperature set points with the aim of assessing the energy consumed at each one. In the same area of application, the study [46] proposes the selection of a fixed temperature set point that balances between the comfort of the occupants and energy savings, establishing fixed temperatures of 22 °C ± 2 °C and 24 °C respectively. Another subset of studies is based on the analysis of the PMV value with the objective of introducing the thermal preferences of the occupants regarding its internal variables in the decision-making of the system, aiming to develop more efficient control models. Continuing with the methodology described, [47\u201349] propose modifications of the HVAC system parameters based on the value of the PMV of the occupants of the building, aiming to adjust to their needs. [50,51] assesses changes in different parameters of the HVAC systems in order to maintain the value of the PMV of the occupants close to the neutral value, in the interval [-0.5, 0.5]. Similarly, there a number of studies that use fuzzy logic to achieve comfortable environments, promoting the use of automated adaptive measures to obtain indoor conditions that are comfortable for the majority of the occupants, while also reducing energy consumption. The studies [52\u201354] carry out an operational control of the windows to obtain a set of optimum indoor conditions based on the values offered by the PMV. The objective of the study [55] is to minimise the difference between the indoor temperature and the set point established by the user in the HVAC system. For this, it uses a control set over the heating and lighting systems of the building. The study carried out in [56] prioritises adaptive measures, such as the opening and closing of windows and blinds in order to achieve indoor environments based on ranges of PMV values [-0.5, −0.7] for winter and [0.5, 0.7] for summer. To summarise, the application of this technique facilitates the modelling of the variables involved in the indoor thermal comfort evaluation. It is able to reduce the uncertainty associated with the personal preferences of the occupants and with the zones close the comfort ranges, obtaining rapid and reliable results for predicting the thermal comfort of the occupant. 3 Methodology This section describes the model proposed for carrying out an effective evaluation of the comfort temperature ranges proposed in the EN 16798\u20131:2019 standard [57]. The structure of the model is shown in Fig. 1 . The figure includes the traditional methodology of adaptive thermal comfort, represented in Module (1) and described in detail in Section 3.1, to which modules (2) and (3) are added, referring to the new methodology proposed by this study, and described in Section 3.2. Module (1) represents the traditional methodology carried out in the evaluation of thermal comfort. This module proposes the adaptive comfort model used with a selected database and its respective temperature ranges. Next, the value of R2 (R-squared) metric is calculated together with the Percentage of Dissatisfied (PD). These provide a vision of the degree of adjustment of the model to the thermal comfort questionnaires and the degree of dissatisfaction existing among the occupants for the proposed ranges. In Module (2) of the suggested model, predictions are made about the thermal comfort of the occupants based on the proposed temperature ranges. After comparing these predictions with the responses of the occupants to the thermal comfort questionnaires, a set of indicators is obtained that allows to obtain the degree of real representativeness of the comfort ranges on the real preferences of the occupants. Finally, in Module (3) the indicators obtained in Module (2) are grouped in order to obtain a set of metrics that offers information about characteristics not considered in the traditional evaluation of the adaptive comfort models. This is of use for the definition of more efficient comfort models. The implementation of the proposed methodology in HVAC systems allows to obtain comfortable thermal environments for the majority of the building occupants, including the most demanding with the thermal environment, while reducing the energy consumption of the system. 3.1 Traditional methodology Currently, to determine the indoor comfort temperature of buildings without mechanical conditioning systems or mixed-mode buildings, the adaptive comfort theory could be used [18,58,59]. This proposes the use of a comfort equation that relates the outdoor temperature of the buildings to the indoor temperature. This equation is obtained from the linear approximation of the set of responses in the questionnaires carried out on a set of occupants of a particular building, in which the thermal sensation is registered for the indoor and outdoor temperature of the building at a specific moment [60]. In turn, a set of comfort ranges in which the majority of occupants are comfortable is allocated to the equation. These ranges depend on the requirements of the occupants and the type of building [61]. Narrower ranges are used for sensitive people, which in turn suppose increased energy consumption. Although, initially, adaptive thermal comfort was associated to naturally ventilated buildings, there are actually references [58,62] in the literature that evidence the comfort processes in all buildings, including those that are air conditioned, highlighting the applicability of adaptive standards to mixed-mode buildings. These adaptive models have introduced significant improvements for the comfort of the occupants while also reducing energy consumption [63,62,64]. The uncertainty associated with the temperature ranges is mainly due to a number of factors including variability in the individual thermal preferences of the occupants or limitations in the application of these ranges in different seasons of the year. Similarly, the adaptation of individual to the thermal environment may be affected by cultural factors and by the quality of the building construction [65,66]. In summary, although the thermal comfort equations and associated temperature ranges are a useful tool for making predictions about the thermal sensation of the occupants in a given environment, there is also a significant degree of uncertainty which should be considered when applying them. It is important to use them together with other considerations and taking into account the specific characteristics of the environment and the occupants to obtain a more precise assessment of thermal comfort. In addition, it would be of interest to make a more thorough analysis of the temperature ranges, given that if a valid correlation is established between these and the needs of the occupants, more energy efficient control models of the HVAC systems can be developed, which do not compromise the thermal comfort of the occupants. 3.2 Proposed methodology This section describes modules (2) and (3) from Fig. 1, which include the metrics formulated for complementing the traditional methodology of module (1) shown in the same figure. Section \u201c3.2.1 Indicators and Metrics\u201d describes the set of metrics and potential improvements offered to the evaluation of the traditional comfort models. Similarly, in section \u201c3.2.2 Uncertainty in the limits of the thermal comfort range\u201d, a detailed description is given of the technique selected for making predictions about the comfort of the occupants, together with the reasons for its selection in this study. This allows for a more efficient use of the large amount of energy used in the HVAC systems of office buildings. 3.2.1 Indicators and metrics After selecting a comfort equation and associated temperature ranges in module (1), in module (2) an estimation is made of the thermal sensation of the occupants for the indoor and outdoor temperature values, at which the thermal comfort questionnaire was carried out. This estimation is based on the criteria defined by the comfort temperature ranges, estimating the thermal comfort of the occupant for the inside temperature values to the ranges and discomfort for the outside values respectively. This estimation is compared to the thermal sensation vote of the occupant (TSV) collected in the questionnaires forming the databases under study. An occupant is considered comfortable if their answer in the questionnaire is within the range [-1, 1] and uncomfortable if it is outside the range. After obtaining the thermal comfort estimate for the occupant and the thermal sensation vote from a certain questionnaire, the evaluation metrics are used to determine their degree of success, defining the following terms for this purpose [67,68]: \u2022 True Comfort (TC): this indicator is obtained when the system predicts comfort (1), while the thermal sensation vote of the occupant is within the comfort range, T S V ∈ [ - 1 , 1 ] , which means, the system correctly predicts comfort and aligns with the comfort state of the occupant. \u2022 False Comfort (FC): this indicator is obtained when the system predicts comfort (1), while the thermal sensation vote of the occupant is outside the comfort range, T S V ∉ - 1 , 1 , which means, the system incorrectly predicts comfort when the occupant is experiencing discomfort. \u2022 True Discomfort (TD): this indicator is obtained when the system predicts discomfort (0), while the thermal sensation vote of the occupant is outside the comfort range, T S V ∉ [ - 1 , 1 ] , which means, the system correctly predicts discomfort and aligns with the comfort state of the occupant. \u2022 False Discomfort (FD): this indicator is obtained when the system predicts discomfort (0), while the thermal sensation vote of the occupant is within the comfort range, T S V ∈ [ - 1 , 1 ] , which means, the system incorrectly predicts discomfort when the occupant is experiencing comfort. These indicators allow to evaluate the performance of a system or model that predicts thermal comfort based on TSV of the occupant. The distribution and frequency of these indicators can be used to assess the accuracy reliability of the prediction made by the system, as well as, identify areas where improvements might be needed. The set of indicators is presented on a graph in Fig. 2 . Note the colour code given on the graph, as this is used throughout the study to refer to the degree of success of the proposed model. The success of the technique in estimating the comfort of the occupants is shown in brown while the failure is given in grey. Using the set of indicators obtained, the evaluation metrics used in this study are defined as described in Table 1 [67,68,69,70]: The true percentage of dissatisfied (PD) shown in (Eq. 1) describes the proportion of responses to the questionnaires in which the occupants feel uncomfortable. This metric is of use for comparing the percentage of dissatisfied predicted by the regulation to the true percentage of dissatisfied occupants. R2 (R-squared) shown in (Eq. 2) is an evaluation metric which measures the quality of adjustment of the occupant comfort votes to the comfort equation proposed by each model, representing the proportion of the variance of a variable Tin in terms of the variable Trm. This metric is calculated as described in (Eq. 1), where the parameters used are as follows: \u2022 T i n i : true indoor temperature value for a comfort vote. \u2022 T i n i ^ : theoretical temperature value given by the comfort equation for a value T r m i . \u2022 T i n ¯ : mean indoor temperature value obtained for the set of comfort votes. The Precision metric shown in (Eq. 3) refers to the proportion of true positives of the total predicted as positive, that is, the number of successes of the total predicted as positive, in other words, all the times that comfort is predicted and the thermal comfort vote of the occupants really is comfortable, from among all the times that comfort is predicted. In addition, this metric shows how representative the range of comfort temperatures proposed for the occupants is, as it evaluates the quality of the predictions of user thermal comfort. On the other hand, the Recall metric shown in (Eq. 4) shows the proportion of true positives of the total existing positives, that is, all the times that comfort is predicted and the thermal sensation vote of the occupant really is comfortable out of all the times that the occupants vote that they are comfortable. This metric shows the percentage of users who are really in their comfort zone and that the model is able to identify, without considering the existing discomfort. In addition, this metric represents the degree of adjustment of the established temperature range to the true thermal sensation of the occupants and is representative for a potential energy saving of the model. The Accuracy metric shown in (Eq. 5) describes the proportion of cases in which the proposed model is successful in its predictions, that is, everything it has predicted correctly out of all the occupant questionnaires. This metric shows the percentage of success of the proposed methodology out of all the predictions made, but it should be noted that this metric may not be representative when the results are not balanced. Finally, F1 shown in (Eq. 6) is the combination of the Precision and Recall metrics. This metric gives the same weight to both. It is the most interesting metric from the point of view of comfort and energy savings evaluated together, as it weights the indicators associated with both factors. 3.2.2 Uncertainty in the limits of thermal comfort ranges The variability associated with the individual thermal preferences of the occupants is a major source of uncertainty in the selection of a comfortable temperature that may lead to the existence of cases of thermal discomfort within the comfort ranges, or, on the other hand, of comfort outside the ranges. The theory of fuzzy sets facilitates the rational definition of those concepts whose nature is imprecise, where the inaccuracy is represented in membership functions used to obtain the fuzzy variables. Therefore, it is seen as a useful tool in modelling and decision-making in the control of HVAC systems. In addition, this methodology allows effective predictions of occupant comfort, reducing the uncertainty associated with the limits of the comfort ranges, where there is greater variability in their thermal sensation. Most models based on fuzzy logic are structured as proposed by the Mandami methodology [50], in which four stages are distinguished: (i) fuzzification, (ii) fuzzy rules, (iii) inference interface and (iv) defuzzification [31]. In the fuzzification stage (i), the numerical input variables are evaluated to determine the degree of membership to the respective fuzzy sets modelled using membership functions, in order to convert them into fuzzy values \u200b\u200binterpretable by the inference interface. When defining membership function for a fuzzy set, the values \u200b\u200bclosest to 1 represent the greater membership of the sample to said fuzzy set. The membership functions mostly used by fuzzy systems are triangular and trapezoidal, due to their ease of implementation and interpretation by the inference system. The set of fuzzy rules (ii) provides the fuzzy system with the human expert behaviour to be implemented in the decision-making process, relating the input variables to the output variables. The inference interface (iii) generates the set of fuzzy values \u200b\u200bof the output variables. To do this, depending on the percentage of membership to the system's input functions, a set of rules will be selected that must be combined to carry out control actions on the system. Finally, in the defuzzification process (iv), the fuzzy output values \u200b\u200bare transformed into numerical values \u200b\u200bby using an inference method selected on the membership function defined for the output variable of the fuzzy system. Below, the particularization for the databases considered in the present study is exposed. For this, firstly, the true input variables of the system Trm and Tin are evaluated in order to determine the limits of the fuzzy universe, to them proceed with their fuzzification, where they are converted in fuzzy variables called TRM and TIN respectively. To do so, the methodology proposed by Wang [71] and Hussain [38] is used, adopting a set of triangular and trapezoidal membership functions (represented by colours on the axes, from blue, regarding lower indoor and outdoor temperatures, to red for higher temperatures) for the definition of the input variables of the proposed system, as shown in Fig. 3 , elaborated by the authors. This figure also shows the value of the output variables that represent the system predictions, where these are for thermal comfort in the green zone close to the comfort equation and for thermal discomfort in the red zone outside the temperature ranges. The area in yellow represents the fuzziness existing in the zone close to the limit values of the comfort ranges, in which an output of the system is obtained depending on the degree of membership of the input variables. The system proposed has a matrix of m·n fuzzy rules, where m = i ∊ Z | T R M m i n ≤ i ≤ T R M m a x is the number of columns, obtained by the sampling in 1 °C steps of the input variable Trm for all the existing universe of this variable in the selected database. The value n = j ∊ Z | T I N m i n ≤ j ≤ T I N m a x corresponds to the number of rows in the matrix of fuzzy rules given by the individual sampling of the variable Tin for all the existing universe of this variable in the same database. In function of the membership of the input values, a fuzzy rule is activated referring to the values TRMi and TINj within the comfort ranges, the output state COMFORT is generated, whereas if, to the contrary, it is outside these ranges, the DISCOMFORT state is generated. This output represents the estimation of the occupant thermal comfort by the system. 3.3 Case studies The following section describes the characteristics of the three databases used in the validation of the model proposed in this study. Similarly, the comfort equations associated with each of such databases are defined, and different upper and lower limits to the indoor temperature ranges are imposed on these equations. The comfort equations selected for the study are shown in Table 2 below: In this study, it has been decided to represent the density of questionnaires by using three categories of squares that vary in size based on the number of different existing votes. This serves to add visibility to the zones where there are more questionnaires and to the degree of satisfaction with the selected comfort ranges, enabling a graphic visualisation of the real thermal preferences of the occupants in each case study. To indicate the thermal sensation votes, a colour range has been selected in which green represents comfort and discomfort is represented by red. 3.3.1 MedSpain database The field study was carried out in Seville, the city with the fourth highest population in Spain. The city is in the southwest of Spain, in the Guadalquivir valley, and is classified by the term \u2018Csa\u2019 in accordance with the classification defined by Köppen-Geiger [73], corresponding to \u201cWarm temperate climate with dry and hot summers\u201d. This classification is applied to the majority of countries with a Mediterranean climate. The climate of Seville is characterised by its temperatures and is one of the cities with the highest average temperatures in Europe, reaching over 40 °C several times a year. The methodology proposed in this paper has been carried out using a database obtained in a field study in a mixed-mode office building. This study lasted a whole year, during which more than 2,607 questionnaires were obtained, where variables related to the occupants were considered, analysing their thermal sensation, and thermal preference, among others ([72], Table 4). Moreover, indoor variables (indoor air temperature, globe temperature, indoor relative humidity, air velocity or CO2 concentration) and outdoor variables (outdoor temperature or outdoor relative humidity) were also monitored ([72], Table 3 ), ([72], Fig. 3). Fig. 4 is a scatter diagram of the thermal sensation questionnaires of the occupants from the MedSpain database. Here it can be seen that the majority of the questionnaires are comfortable, with the greatest density of them in the zone for the winter season. On the other hand, the majority of discomfort questionnaires are in the zone for low indoor temperatures for the same season. 3.3.2 Europe database In the SCATs study [60], a comfort equation was obtained representative of the European thermal preferences in naturally ventilated office buildings. Given that the database obtained in such study is not public, a sub-database was created from the public database, ASHRAE [74,75] called Europe. After filtering the data, a set of 3,568 thermal comfort questionnaires were obtained from the set of countries involved in the original SCATs study, as shown in Fig. 5 . 3.3.3 ASHRAE database The ASHRAE database was filtered by naturally ventilated buildings and office buildings in all the existing countries, obtaining a subset of 11,402 valid entries, represented in Fig. 6 . This shows that the zones with a greater density of votes are in the zone referring to the summer season, with a thermal discomfort existing in the zones with low temperatures throughout the year. 4 Results and discussion The following section presents the results of the evaluation of the different thermal comfort ranges in the proposed databases. In section \u201c4.1 Results: Evaluation of comfort ranges\u201d, the comfort ranges defined in the EN 16798\u20131:2019 standard [57] are used for the three case studies proposed. Section \u201c4.2 Results: Seasonal variations in thermal comfort ranges\u201d proposes the analysis of the effect of a modification to the comfort ranges established by the regulation, assessing their feasibility through the results obtained in the different databases. 4.1 Results: Evaluation of comfort ranges This section presents the results of the evaluation metrics obtained by the system for the different temperature ranges listed in the EN 16798\u20131:2019 standard [57]. The evaluation of these techniques serves to analyse which comfort ranges best define the true behaviour of the occupants in the different case studies proposed, permitting the implementation of more efficient control models for the HVAC system or, to the contrary, models in which the overall thermal comfort of the users is prioritised. 4.1.1 MedSpain database This case proposes the use of the comfort equation defined for the MedSpain database in Table 2, together with the temperature ranges for building categories I, II and III. As in the previous sections, squares of different sizes are used to refer to the votes existing in the figure. In this case, a colour range is used where brown refers to the success in the comfort predictions and grey refers to the errors. Fig. 7 shows the success of the technique proposed in the temperature ranges for Category I (the thermal comfort range of the category is represented by dashed lines, parallel to the adaptive thermal comfort equation, represented by a solid line). Similarly, it can be seen how the methodology selected estimates the state of thermal comfort of the occupants with a high percentage of success within the temperature ranges. The samples in grey, indicating errors in the estimate, reflects the existence of a set of comfort votes outside the established ranges, making the selection of a higher category feasible. The presence of this type of sample in indoor temperature values up to 3 °C from the comfort ranges indicates the potential improvement of the adaptive control algorithm with respect to the representativeness of the votes of the occupants in this zone. As can be seen in Fig. 8 , the use of comfort ranges from Categories II and III gives a lower quantity of comfort votes outside the thermal comfort ranges, obtaining a better representation of the set of samples. The degree of success of the system continues to be high, with the majority of the set in brown, regardless of the density of votes. The results obtained after the application of the methodology proposed to the different thermal comfort ranges in the MedSpain database are given in Table 3: Table 3 shows that metrics of the traditional methodology PD and R2 remain constant, given that they do not change with the modification of the temperature ranges. According to the PD metric, the recommended comfort range corresponds to that of Category II (PPD < 10 %). Regarding R2, previous works in the literature obtained similar values for such magnitude ([76,77,78] or [79]). On the other hand, the Precision metric which indicates the thermal comfort of the occupants of the building, recommends the application of thermal comfort ranges from Category I (+2 °C, −3 °C). As the comfort ranges are widened, the value of the Recall metric, which indicates the potential energy savings of the model, increases by a greater percentage than that by which the Precision metric decreases. Therefore, the F1 metric which weights both metrics, obtains its maximum value for Category III (+4 °C, −5 °C). The values obtained from the Accuracy metric in the three categories indicate that the model represents the thermal preferences of the occupants correctly, estimating a large part of the predictions made. 4.1.2 Europe and ASHRAE database The results obtained after the application of the methodology proposed to the Europe and ASHRAE databases in the different categories produces the graphs shown in Fig. 9 : The proposed methodology in this study to the Europe database shows that there are clear differences in comparison with the MedSpain database. Firstly, the range of values on the indoor temperature axis is greater, ranging from 10 °C to 40 °C. From the colour of the graphs, the predominance of success in the prediction of comfort is observed in all the categories proposed, although the high quantity of discomfort votes in the thermal comfort ranges in the zone corresponding to the summer should be noted. This is mainly because the countries taking part in the development of the database belong to generally mild climates, where the occupants of the buildings would not have the capacity to adapt to the high temperatures. Finally, a high number of thermal sensation questionnaires outside the comfort ranges in Category I can be observed. This is particularly of note in summer, where the existence of comfort votes of up to 4 °C above the upper comfort range can be observed, indicating the potential improvement of the control algorithm in these zones. In addition, in the graphs corresponding to all the categories proposed in the ASHRAE database, a band of discomfort votes is observed within the ranges close to the lower temperature range in the summer zone, indicating occupant preferences for higher temperatures, a factor that could be used to reduce the energy consumption of the system. Similarly, as observed for the Europe database, there is a high density of votes outside the limits established for the comfort temperature ranges, which is of particular note in the extreme upper and lower values of indoor temperature. In the results of the metrics shown in Table 4 , the differences between the thermal comfort ranges selected for each database can be observed. On the one hand, it can be seen how the density of votes affects the widening of the temperature ranges differently depending on the database selected. With respect to the Precision indicator, it can be seen that in the Europe database there is a higher degree of comfort among the occupants for Category I than for the rest of the categories. On the other hand, the Recall metric follows the behaviour seen in the MedSpain database, giving a higher capacity for energy savings to the comfort ranges in Category III in both databases. As for the MedSpain database, the Accuracy indicator shows that the selected ranges are largely representative of the true behaviour of the occupants. Finally, with respect to the PD metric, it is observed that Category III is the most appropriate for selection in both databases. 4.2 Results: Seasonal variations in thermal comfort ranges This section proposes a modification to the winter and summer temperature ranges, where there is greater demand for comfortable environments by the occupants. Thus, an alternative is proposed which seeks a reduction in the energy consumption of the HVAC system, while also giving greater relevance to the set of questionnaires outside these ranges. It is proposed a winter temperature range which sets the HVAC thermostat to a lower temperature during the working hours. This could be combined with a clothing recommendation system, which suggests warm clothing to stay comfortable at lower temperatures, based on the current average temperature and other factors. In contrast to this, in the summer, the HVAC thermostat is set to a higher temperature when occupants are outside. This could be also combined with other adaptive solutions such as ceiling fans or portable fans to increase air circulation and create a cooling effect, or the use of blinds or shades that are closed during the hottest parts of the day to block out sunlight and heat when the user is outside. When outdoor temperatures are comfortable, especially during transitional seasons such as spring or autumn, natural ventilation by opening windows and doors is recommended. Fig. 10 shows how a reduction (highlighted in blue) and increase (highlighted in red) of one degree in the temperature in winter and summer respectively, results in a higher number of comfort questionnaires within the ranges. Similarly, the modification of the ranges of the other categories and databases considered in this study was proposed, obtaining the set of scatter diagrams shown in Fig. 11 . Comfort ranges from all the categories with seasonal variation in all the databases and predictions made. The results of the metrics obtained after the modification are shown in Table 5 . In the results for the MedSpain database, it can be observed how by slightly reducing the Precision indicator, an increased saving in energy of the system is obtained, given by the Recall metric, in comparison to the results obtained for the ranges without modification. In addition, a higher degree of success is observed for the technique in the rise of the Accuracy metric. While the results obtained after the modification of the ranges in the Europe database show the same tendency for change as described for the MedSpain database, in the ASHRAE database an improvement is achieved in the thermal comfort of the occupants with the proposed modification of the temperature ranges. This is largely due to the density of votes outside the ranges proposed in this database, indicating the adaptability of the occupants. 4.3 Discussion According to the principles of adaptive comfort, which recognises that occupants can adapt and feel comfortable within a range of environmental conditions, it is necessary to explore the possibility of extending the indoor temperature ranges while maintaining occupant comfort in order to propose a modification of the winter and summer temperature ranges that balances occupant comfort and energy consumption. For that, a methodology is proposed, which tries to delve into the study of thermal comfort ranges and the variability of the thermal comfort questionnaires in the zones close to the temperature ranges defined in current regulations, based on a set of indicators and metrics that face the evaluation of the degree of real representativeness of the comfort ranges and the preferences of the occupants. Of all the metrics proposed, Precision addresses the quality of predictions made about an adaptive thermal comfort model (equation and associated temperature range). A low value for this indicator would imply a higher number of occupant discomfort votes are inside the established comfort range. Considering this indicator, minor modifications could be introduced to the proposed model in order to obtain better adaptation to the true thermal sensation of the occupants of the building (changing the slope of the equation, increasing or decreasing temperature ranges especially the straight line or only in certain zones, depending on the distribution of the thermal sensation votes of the occupants). In addition, the Recall metric considers the true comfort votes of the users of the building. This indicator gives an idea of the quality of the temperature range proposed according to the building category. A low value for this indicator implies that many of the user comfort votes are out of the established comfort range, which is no longer representative of the true thermal sensation of the occupants and requires the range to be increased. Considering this indicator, it is possible to make modifications to the comfort range, adapting it to the true sensation of the occupants, being representative for a potential energy saving of the system. The proposed methodology should be implemented considering the values of the Accuracy metric as this evaluates the thermal comfort predictions of the occupants made by the technique selected, providing information about the percentage of successes. Finally, the F1-score metric is proposed. This weights the values obtained from Precision and Recall. Its main interest lies in the fact that, thanks to this metric, it is possible to establish a model which considers the comfort of the occupants (given by Precision) without ignoring the potential energy savings of this (given by Recall). The addition of new evaluation metrics (Precision, Recall, Accuracy, and F1) complements and refers to aspects that the traditional metrics (R2 and PD) do not consider. Therefore, a more in-depth analysis is made of the proposed temperature ranges, enabling a better adjustment of these to the individual preferences of the set of occupants. Particularizing for the cases studies considered, the traditional evaluation metrics (R2 and PD) would help to establish an initial approximation of the building category to be selected, which may be modified according to the metrics obtained by the methodology proposed to direct the performance of the system towards the required objective. Considering these, it is observed that for the MedSpain and Europe databases, the introduction of Category II is recommended while for the ASHRAE database the use of Category III is recommended. Considering Table 3, Table 4 and Table 5, it is observed that from the point of view of occupant comfort, indicated by the Precision metric, the narrowest temperature ranges, such as those from Category I, have a greater proportion of users in the thermal comfort zone and as the building category increases this value decreases. On the other hand, if the aim is to establish temperature ranges which prioritise the energy savings of the HVAC system, the Recall metric should be mainly considered. This shows that the most efficient models are those with wider temperature ranges and that in function of the density of comfort votes outside the temperature ranges, it is possible to make a seasonal modification to these ranges as proposed in section \u201c4.2. Seasonal variations in thermal comfort ranges\u201d of this study. It is also observed that the addition of the Accuracy metric is of use for the evaluation of the success of the technique selected, obtaining for this study values above 71 % in all the temperature ranges proposed for the different databases. Based on the existing literature, the adaptive thermal comfort strategy leads to energy savings and allows a wider range of temperatures for the occupants' thermal comfort [80]. References can be found that report examples of adaptation to wider indoor temperatures ranges than initially expected based on the existing regulations, as for naturally ventilated buildings as well as mixed-mode buildings [81]. Therefore, a modification of the comfort ranges proposed by the legislation may lead to situations in which significant improvements are obtained in the percentage of comfortable occupants and energy savings, so considering that, the proposed methodology described in this paper aims to delve into this objective by analysing indoor comfort ranges and proposing a set of metrics which reflect characteristics not previously considered. 4.3.1 Assumptions and future trends After obtaining the results, it is shown that the application of the methodology described in this study facilitates the selection of suitable temperature ranges for the set of occupants. This complements the traditional evaluation of thermal comfort, offering a set of metrics which provide information about occupant satisfaction regarding the different temperature ranges proposed, permitting thermal comfort ranges to be established which are better adapted to the needs of the occupants or energy requirements of the systems. Given the data obtained from the modification of the comfort ranges, a future line of research is proposed, in which the introduction of the metrics developed in this study in a conditioning system would serve as a method for evaluating different adaptive comfort ranges and modifications, based on the responses of the occupants. Moreover, although the methodology proposed has been initially tested considering three databases, in which the average indoor thermal comfort ranges of a group of occupants has been analysed, the methodology itself would be valid considering smaller groups of users, focusing on analysing individualized thermal comfort and accounting for individual differences. As for the assumptions or conditions under which the methodology proposed is applicable, they are those associated with the application of the adaptive thermal comfort standard itself [12]. Since EN 16798\u20131 [18] relates indoor comfort temperature with the running mean outdoor temperature, the weighing factor would have an impact on said variable and, therefore, on indoor comfort temperature, duet to the effect of different α-values [60]. Moreover, it is also important to note the relevance of the accuracy of the mean outdoor daily temperature. Additionally, the present work is based on a particular climatology and types of buildings, therefore further studies would be helpful in order to consider different conditions for evaluating the methodology proposed. 5 Conclusions This paper aims to delve into the study of indoor comfort temperature based on the adaptive approach, and by analysing the different indoor comfort ranges proposed by existing regulation EN 16798\u20131. The main contributions of this study can be summarized as follows: \u2022 Four indicators and four metrics are proposed in order to quantitatively evaluate different indoor comfort ranges, based on the thermal sensation votes of the occupants. \u2022 A fuzzy logic-based methodology is proposed for analysing the uncertainty in the limits of thermal comfort ranges. \u2022 Three databases are considered for validating the methodology proposed, which comprises a field study carried out in a mixed-mode building in Seville (MedSpain) and data from ASHRAE Global Thermal Comfort Database II. Seasonal variation in thermal comfort ranges were also considered and evaluated. \u2022 Regarding of the practical interpretation of the metrics proposed, the Precision metric would indicate the thermal comfort of the occupants, the Recall metric would represent the potential energy savings, F1 weights previous metrics and Accuracy would indicate the representativeness of the thermal preferences of the occupants. \u2022 Comparing the metrics for the databases considered, with respect to the Precision metric, in Europe database a higher degree of comfort among the occupants for Category I is identified, than for the rest of the categories. As for the Recall metric, MedSpain and Europe have similar behaviour, being a higher capacity for energy savings Category III. As for the MedSpain database, the Accuracy indicator shows that the selected ranges are largely representative of the true behaviour of the occupants. \u2022 In terms of the seasonal variations proposed, MedSpain and Europe also show the same tendency, which involves that, by reducing the Precision indicator, a feasible energy saving increased could be obtained. ASHRAE database showed an improvement in the thermal comfort of the occupants with the variations proposed. The study reinforces the relevance of analysing indoor comfort ranges of buildings, due to its relationship with the thermal comfort of their occupants and energy savings. The addition of the new evaluation indicators and metrics proposed would suppose a significant advance in the evaluation of the quality of different thermal comfort ranges, complementing the information provided by the traditional methodology and considering details not previously evaluated which would help to select temperature ranges better suited to the thermal preferences of the occupants. Moreover, the proposed methodology would assist a building management system and it would also promote new decisions in term of prioritizing thermal comfort energy efficiency or a balance between both, in case it was implemented in a conditioning system.

        "dc:description": "The selection of a suitable indoor temperature is a challenge to society, since its relationship with thermal comfort and energy consumption. The adaptive thermal comfort theory addresses this problem relating indoor with outdoor temperatures and based on that, defines temperature ranges. This paper defines a fuzzy logic-based methodology to assess the suitability of indoor adaptive temperature ranges proposed by existing regulations of the real thermal sensation of the occupants. For this purpose, the study suggests considering four indicators to evaluate the representativeness of different comfort ranges on the real preferences of the occupants. Based on that, four metrics are proposed for interpreting the needs of the occupants of a building and the changes required to the temperature ranges to satisfy such needs. To validate the proposed methodology, questionnaires on the thermal sensation of the occupants of office buildings considering three case studies (Mediterranean, Europe, ASHRAE) are used, showing the results obtained the representativeness of adaptive comfort ranges for such databases. The feasible introduction of this methodology in a conditioning systems would assist in decision making regarding energy efficiency, thermal comfort and a balance between them.",
