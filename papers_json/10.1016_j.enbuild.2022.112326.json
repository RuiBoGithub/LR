Central air conditioning accounts for more than 40 % of the energy consumption of social buildings. Ensuring the efficient operation of central air conditioning at full working conditions has a positive impact on reducing the total energy consumption of society. In this paper, the historical operation data of central air conditioning in a commercial building in Shenzhen is used as the source and the energy-saving strategy of this central air conditioning system is studied using 2019 data as the main research data. Firstly, the measured parameters are extracted as the Cooling factor, Delivery factor, and Load factor based on factor analysis, and the K-Means algorithm is used as input parameters for pattern recognition of the central air conditioning system. Then, according to the results of pattern recognition, C5.0 and the CHAID decision tree algorithm are used to obtain the energy-saving strategy model. Finally, the 2020 operational data of the building's central air conditioning system was used as the validation data set for energy efficiency verification.

Air conditioning is a non-linear and complex system composed of several sub-systems coupled together. The actual operational energy efficiency is affected by the matching characteristics of each sub-system and the usage patterns of end-users which is a dynamically changing system under the action of multiple factors [3\u20135]. With the rapid development of computer information technology, data mining technology in the medical, marketing, industrial manufacturing, and other fields have achieved better application results. According to the multi-dimensional and multi-quantity, non-linear, and highly redundant characteristics of central air-conditioning operating parameters, pattern recognition, classification and prediction, association rule analysis, and other functions of data mining are used to carry out energy-saving optimization research on them. The central air-conditioning system is a complex structure coordinated by multiple complex subsystems. It is very important how to accurately identify the pattern. Compared with traditional pattern recognition methods for refrigeration systems, artificial intelligence methods based on data mining have the advantages of a short research period, low research cost, accurate and reliable research results, etc [6\u201313]. There are various types of Heating Ventilation Air Conditioning (HVAC) faults, which need to be classified and identified. The fault and detection of chillers is a multi-classification problem and a two-stage (including identification of fault types and determination of fault severity levels) data-driven strategy using a discriminant analysis algorithm is proposed [14]. Li [15] proposed a new combined principal element analysis-residual space-support vector data description (PCA-R-SVDD) algorithm, whose established pattern recognition model still has a correct rate higher than 50 % for minor faults identification. Zhao [16] compares and analyzes three commonly used fault detection and diagnosis methods, and the results show that the decoupling model-based fault diagnosis and detection method has the best performance of being able to diagnose multiple faults simultaneously. To reduce the energy consumption of HVAC system operation and provide a comfortable thermal environment, Zhi [17] established an artificial neural network-based pattern recognition model to identify multiple faults in the actual operation of HVAC. The ultimate goal of central air conditioning system operation mode identification research is to ensure that the system can operate with high energy efficiency and low energy consumption. The actual operation of central air conditioning is a dynamic process that changes with end-user demand, environmental conditions, and other factors. If the continuous excellent operating characteristics cannot be guaranteed, it will not only affect the thermal comfort experience of the end-user but also increase the operating energy consumption [18,19]. Therefore, the energy-saving optimization of central air-conditioning is the focus of current research. Due to the strong coupling of the central air conditioning system, the operating parameters interact with each other and the relationship is complex, which makes it difficult to dig out the cause-and-effect relationship between each equipment parameter. Therefore, the research idea of fully excavating its correlation and supplementing by causal relationship has become an effective research method [20\u201323]. Sun [24] combined anomaly detection, feature selection, and parameter optimization to optimize the HVAC energy prediction model, and the results showed that the root means the square error of the optimized model was reduced from 6.44 to 2.76 and from 7.82 to 4.11 for summer cooling and winter heating conditions, respectively. The system operation energy consumption as a direct optimization target can quickly and effectively achieve the optimal energy-saving system operation strategy. Zhou [25] researched the energy-saving optimization of the whole life cycle of air-conditioning and used the K-Means clustering algorithm to build a high-precision central air conditioning cold source system fusion model combining neural network model and parameter identification model, which predicted the energy consumption of the cold source system within 8 %, in addition to deriving three optimization strategies including fixed flow operation of the cold source system, separate optimization of the chilled water side and separate optimization of the cooling water side. The energy-saving rate is up to 13.2 %. Yao [26] uses both air conditioning energy consumption and air inlet temperature as optimization objectives, solves them using a non-dominated ranking genetic algorithm, and verifies the accuracy and efficiency of this optimization result using a neural network model. To optimize the energy saving of central air conditioning, it is also possible to optimize the energy-saving by analyzing the characteristics of each parameter during the operation of the system and then optimizing the matching between the operating parameters and the control and regulation strategy [27,28]. Kusiak A et al [29] established four (chiller, fan, pump, and variable air-box) energy consumption models with total energy consumption minimization as the optimization objective and used the particle swarm algorithm to solve the optimal solutions of key operating parameters under different operating conditions, and the results showed that the total energy consumption of the optimized system could be reduced by about 7.66 %. Fan et al [30] studied the energy consumption characteristics of a single office building and proposed a strategy for identifying abnormal energy consumption patterns based on association rules with large energy-saving potential. Jiang et al [31] proposed practical and effective optimal control strategies based on the actual operating characteristics of central air conditioning systems by using association rule algorithms to study the operating parameter relationships. The air conditioning performance optimization using different machine learning algorithms is shown in Table.1 . Compared with other algorithms, the K-Means clustering algorithm and decision tree algorithm have the features of easy understanding and implementation, intuitive display of logical relationships, and fast convergence. However, according to the literature research, it is found that there are not many studies that use these two algorithms for air conditioning energy-saving optimization. From the available literature, it can be found that these two algorithms have few drawbacks and can significantly improve energy efficiency [32,33]. In this paper, two different decision tree algorithms are applied to study the energy-saving optimization of central air conditioning systems. Firstly, factor analysis is used to extract feature parameters, then the K-Means clustering algorithm is used for central air conditioning pattern recognition research, and finally, a strategy of step-by-step energy efficiency optimization diagnosis is proposed based on a decision tree algorithm. To verify the accuracy of the energy-saving strategy scheme obtained by the decision tree algorithm, the central air conditioning operation data of other operation years (not training and test data years) are selected as the validation data set in this paper. The energy consumption and economy before and after the adoption of the energy-saving scheme are used as the measurement standards. 2 System and methodology 2.1 Overview of the central air-conditioning system The central air-conditioning is used for the year-round cooling of a commercial building in Shenzhen. The negative and first floors of the commercial building are commercial, and the second to fifth floors are office floors, with the building profile shown in Fig. 1 . The average temperature of Shenzhen city in January is greater than 10 °C, and the average temperature in July is greater than 25 °C, so Shenzhen city belongs to the hot summer and warm winter climate region [40]. This central air-conditioning system is designed mainly based on reference to \u2018Design code for heating ventilation and air conditioning of civil buildings (GB 50736-2012)[41]\u2019, \u2018Design code for heating ventilation and air conditioning of industrial buildings (GB 50019-2015)[42]\u2019, \u2018Design standard for energy efficiency of public buildings (GB 50189-2005)[43]\u2019. The relevant design parameters of the cold source system and the basic performance parameters of the unit are shown in Tables 2 and 3 below respectively. The central air conditioner is a water-cooled screw chiller and the system structure is shown in Fig. 2 below. The system mainly consists of coupled subsystems such as screw units, chilled water pumps, cooling water pumps, and cooling towers. There are two screw-type units and three chilled water and cooling water pumps, following the principle of \u2018two uses and one standby\u2019. 2.2 Technology route In this paper, the operational data of a commercial central air conditioning system in Shenzhen is studied for energy-saving optimization using machine learning algorithms. As a result of the COVID-19, it was caused the office was closed and the central air conditioning system stopped operating. This paper uses 2018, 2019, and 2020 data for the study, and performs data cleaning for the data collected by the BESCMP platform, performing operations such as eliminating invalid values. The processed 2019 data were used as study data for subsequent analysis, and the 2020 data were retained as the model validation data set. Factor analysis was used to obtain feature factors for 2019 data, and the K-means clustering algorithm was used for pattern recognition to derive the priority for energy efficiency optimization. According to the priority, two different decision tree algorithms are used for the energy efficiency optimization study, and the final energy efficiency optimization strategy is obtained. We retained 2020 data and are used as model validation data for validation, considering energy-saving and economic indicators. The technology roadmap of this paper is shown in Fig. 3 . 2.3 Methodology Factor analysis is a research method to achieve data dimensionality reduction based on the extraction of common factors, which was first proposed by British psychologist C.E. Spielman.[44,45] The core point of factor analysis is to reflect most of the information of the original variables with a small number of weakly correlated or uncorrelated composite factors, and the mathematical model is as follows: (1) X 1 = α 11 f 1 + α 12 f 2 + α 13 f 3 + ⋯ α 1 m f m + ε 1 X 2 = α 21 f 1 + α 22 f 2 + α 23 f 3 + ⋯ α 2 m f m + ε 2 X 3 = α 31 f 1 + α 32 f 2 + α 33 f 3 + ⋯ α 3 m f m + ε 3 ⋮ X n = α n 1 f 1 + α n 2 f 2 + α n 3 f 3 + ⋯ α nm f m + ε n where α ij is denoted as the loading of the i-th variable on the j-th factor. That is, the n variables contained in the original data are represented by a linear combination of m factors, and the expression in matrix form is shown in Equation (2). (2) X = A F + ε where F is the common factor, which is the m mutually perpendicular axes in the high-dimensional space, and A is the factor loading matrix. The relationship between the characteristic factors and the original variables can be described by the following three correlation indicators, which in turn determine the importance of each factor and evaluate the results of factor analysis. αij : It is named factor loading. The correlation between the original variable xi and the factor fj is characterized by a magnitude between −1 and 1. The closer the absolute value is to 1, the stronger the correlation is. hi 2 : It is named variable commonality. The calculation formula is shown in the following equation. It measures one of the important evaluation indicators of the results of the factor analysis model and characterizes the degree of explanation of the original variables by each of the extracted factors. The closer the value of the common degree of variables is to 1, the more the extracted factors contain the information of the original variables. (3) h i 2 = ∑ j = 1 j = m α ij 2 Rj : It is named variance contribution rate of the factor. The following formula is calculated as a key indicator of the importance of each factor extracted. It characterizes the importance of each extracted factor and reflects the degree of explanation of the information contained in the original variables by factor fj . (4) R j = S j 2 k = ∑ i = 1 i = k α ij 2 k After extracting the common factors using factor analysis for the central air conditioning system, this paper uses the clustering algorithm to study the operating characteristics of the central air conditioning system using the obtained common factors as input parameters for pattern recognition. K-Means clustering algorithm is widely used in various industries because of its advantages of easy understanding and fast implementation. The K-Means clustering algorithm measures the degree of difference between data by calculating the distance between them. The original data containing n variables are considered as points on an n-dimensional space, each historical data record represents a point, and the samples with closer distances between points are grouped into the same category. In the K-Means clustering algorithm, the Euclidean distance is used to calculate the distance between individual sample points, for example, the Euclidean distance between two data points × and y is calculated as follows. (5) E U C L I D x , y = ∑ i = 1 i = n x i - y i 2 The flow chart of the K-Means clustering algorithm is shown in Fig. 4 . First, the number of clusters K is specified according to the clustering effect and the actual research problem. If it is satisfied, the clustering result is output, and if not, the clustering result is returned to the second step to be performed again, and finally, the clustering is completed by repeated iterations. In this paper, the results of pattern recognition by the K-Means clustering algorithm are studied for energy-saving optimization using a decision tree algorithm. Since the decision tree algorithm has the advantages of excellent data analysis induction ability and intuitive and easy-to-understand analysis results, and can fully reflect the logical relationship between input variables and target variables, it has been applied to many fields.[46\u201348]. The process of building a decision tree is shown in Fig. 5 , which aims to divide the original multidimensional space into different regions by continuously forming multiple branches so that the output variables within each region of the division belong to the same category. Different decision tree algorithms use different growth criteria and pruning strategies to build models. Currently commonly used decision tree algorithms include C5.0, CHAID (Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detector), CART (Classification And Regression Tree), QUEST (Quick Unbiased Efficient Statistical) Tree), etc [49]. In this paper, two decision tree algorithms, C5.0 and CHAID, which can build multinomial trees, are used to diagnose and optimize the energy-saving operation of central air conditioning systems. C5.0 algorithm assumes the output variable as the message U sent by the source and the input variable as the message V received by the host, to study the relationship between the source and the host. C5.0 algorithm is based on the information theory as the guiding basis and the information gain rate as the criterion, to find the best grouping variable and determine the best splitting point, which facilitates the establishment of the corresponding decision tree model. The information U contained in the output variable Y in the process of building the decision tree is random to the letter host, and the corresponding entropy is calculated according to Eq. (6). While the conditional entropy and information gain of each input variable (X1, X2, X3 \u2026.\u2026..) can be calculated by referring to Eqs. (7) and (8), respectively. It can be seen that the information gain indicator reflects the strength of the average uncertainty elimination ability of the input variables to the output variables, and it can be assumed that the variables with greater information gain should be designated as the best grouping variables. Meanwhile, in the classification results, the output variables have the highest similarity within each group and the greatest difference between different category groups. However, if the size of information gain alone is used as the selection criterion for the best grouping variable, the accuracy is not high because the input variables with many categories usually have the inherent advantage of being the \u201cbest grouping variable\u201d. To solve the above problem, the C5.0 algorithm proposes to use the information gain rate as the index for determining the best grouping variable, which takes into account both the size of the information gain and the cost of obtaining the information gain, and the calculation formula is shown in Eq. (9). (6) E n t U = ∑ P U log 2 1 p U (7) E n t U | X i = ∑ P X i - ∑ P U | X i log 2 P U | X i (8) Gains = U | X i = E n t U - E n t U | X i (9) G a i n s R U , X i = G a i n s U , X i / E n t X i The CHAID decision tree algorithm is called the Chi-square automatic interactive diagnosis. The core of the algorithm is to determine the priority of different attributes using the Chi-square test. In the CHAID decision tree algorithm, if the input variables are numerical, the numerical data will be first discretized in the preprocessing session, and the ChiMerge grouping method is used. The ChiMerge method is a method which is exploring the correlation between grouping results and target variables based on the target variables. (1) The ChiMerge grouping method is to sort numeric input variables in ascending order and divide them into multiple intervals in turn. (2) Construct a cross-group frequency table between the input and output variables. (3) The Chi-square value between each adjacent two groups is calculated, and the Chi-square critical value obtained based on the significance level and degrees of freedom is used as a basis for determining whether there is a significant effect between this input variable and the output variable. (4) The non-significant groups are combined sequentially until the calculated Chi-square value is not lower than the critical value, which also indicates that the input variable has a significant effect on the output variable. 3 Data source and basic analysis 3.1 Data acquisition The online monitoring platform configured in this building is the Building Energy Smart Cloud Monitoring Platform (named BESCMP). This cloud monitoring platform can monitor the operation status of various building equipment (including central air-conditioning system, power supply, and distribution system, water supply and drainage system, elevator/fire fighting system, etc.) in real-time. The monitoring parameters required in this paper are shown in Table.4 . \u2018Economic operation of air conditioning systems (GB/T 17981-2007) [50]\u2019 puts forward corresponding limit values for each energy efficiency index of air conditioning systems. In addition, the standard also specifies the evaluation index limits for the economic operation of chillers, as shown in Table.5 . In this paper, historical records with an EERr below 3.5 are defined as non-standard operating periods, and vice versa as standard operating periods. 3.2 Analysis of energy consumption The energy consumption of a central air conditioning system is not only related to the needs of the end-user but also the coordination between the various subsystems. The precise and efficient matching characteristics can minimize the total energy consumption of the system while meeting the needs of different users. Fig. 6 Overview of the energy consumption of this water-cooled central air conditioning system by major equipment in 2018, 2019, and 2020. The distribution of energy consumption in the three years of operation of the system is similar, in which the chiller plant equipment energy consumption is the main energy consumption of the system, accounting for 54 %, 69 %, and 68 % respectively, followed by chilled water transfer energy consumption and cooling water transfer energy consumption, while the cooling tower energy consumption accounts for only about 5 %, which indicates that the focus of energy-saving optimization of the system should be on the chiller plant system, and the cooling tower energy consumption can be excluded from the scope of energy-saving research of the central air-conditioning system. Considering that 2018 is the early stage of the building's commissioning and 2020 is affected by COVID-19, the historical operating data of these two years do not fully reflect the actual operating characteristics of the central air-conditioning system. On the other hand, the operating characteristics of the central air-conditioning system change yearly, so in the subsequent analysis only the full year 2019 operating data was selected for the study. There are many operating parameters in a central air-conditioning system and the interaction between them makes it necessary to analyze the dynamic characteristics of each operating parameter to provide a direction for subsequent energy-saving optimization studies. Fig. 7 shows that there is a synchronization between the changes in energy consumption of the main engine and the cooling tower, while there is a synchronization between the changes in chilled water pump energy consumption and cooling water pump energy consumption. The energy consumption of the main engine and cooling tower during the air-conditioning season is higher than the operational energy consumption during the non-air-conditioning season, with the difference that the energy consumption of the chilled water pump and cooling water pump during the non-air-conditioning season is much higher than the operational energy consumption during the air-conditioning season. The energy consumption of the pumps in the period January to March, when the ambient temperature is the lowest in the year and the cooling capacity required by the customer is low, is three times higher than the energy consumption of the pumps in the period July to September when the ambient temperature is the highest in the year and the cooling capacity required by the customer is high, which is contrary to the energy-saving design principles and will inevitably result in additional energy wastage. The chilled/cooled water pump energy consumption values show a clear simultaneous dispersion compared to the mainframe energy consumption. The actual operation of this central air-conditioning system deviates from the principles of energy-efficient operation and there is some room for energy-saving optimization. The total energy consumption of the central air-conditioning system mainly includes the energy consumption of chiller units, chilled water pumps, cooling water pumps, cooling towers, and the energy consumption of each piece of equipment in the terminal air treatment units. The distribution of the structure is shown in Fig. 8 , and the subsystems are interrelated. The cloud monitoring platform for the central air-conditioning system used in this building does not capture the energy consumption associated with each piece of equipment at the user's end. This study only investigates the variation characteristics of the energy consumption of the chillers (mainly the main unit), chilled water pumps, cooling water pumps, and cooling towers. Fig. 9 shows the scatter plot matrix distribution of the four energy consumptions of this water-cooled central air-conditioning system. It can be seen that there is a significant linear correlation between each of the two sets of two-dimensional variables, mainframe energy consumption and cooling tower energy consumption, chilled water pump energy consumption and cooling water pump energy consumption. In the scatter matrix diagram, the four pairs of histograms on the diagonal show the distribution of the mainframe energy consumption, chilled water pump energy consumption, cooling water pump energy consumption, and cooling tower energy consumption, respectively. It can be seen that the mainframe energy consumption and cooling tower energy consumption vary continuously throughout the year during the operating hours of this central air-conditioning system, while the chilled water pump energy consumption and cooling water pump energy consumption show a clear trend of discrete distribution. Fig. 10 shows a scatter diagram of the distribution of the energy consumption of the system in each sub-section as a percentage of the total system energy consumption during the operating hours of the year. The share of energy consumption of the cooling towers is the smallest during the whole year of operation and remains stable at 10 %. The energy consumption of the water pumps and the mainframe energy consumption show opposite trends over time. During the non-air-conditioning season, for example, from January to March, both chilled water pump energy consumption and cooling water pump energy consumption have the highest share of the year, fluctuating around 40 % and 25 % respectively. During air conditioning seasonal periods, such as April, the share of chilled water pump energy consumption and cooling water pump energy consumption is significantly reduced to around 20 %. In contrast to the trend in energy consumption of pumps, the mainframe energy consumption is the lowest throughout the year (fluctuating around 30 %) during the non-air-conditioning season from January to March and increases significantly to around 70 %-80 % from April onwards. This is because the ambient temperature from January to March is the lowest of the year and the total energy consumption is the lowest of the year due to the low cooling capacity required by end-users. The temperature difference between the chilled water supply and return and the cooling water inlet and outlet is within 1 °C, with \u2018small temperature difference and large flow\u2019 operating characteristics. Therefore, the energy-saving optimization of the central air conditioning system studied in this paper is mainly to reduce the energy consumption of the pump in the non-air-conditioning season and the energy consumption of the main unit in the air-conditioning season. 4 Results and discussion 4.1 Pattern recognition The operation modes of central air conditioning are closely related to the local climate. Therefore, to match the optimal control strategy for different modes of system operation throughout the year and reduce the operating energy consumption. The different existing operation modes of the system need to be studied. Table.6 shows the magnitude of the correlation coefficients between the variables. It can be seen that the correlation between several variables of the central air-conditioning system is significant, mostly showing a significant linear correlation, in which the correlation coefficients between the energy consumption of the mainframe and the cooling tower, condensing pressure and cooling water inlet and outlet temperature are as high as 0.943, 0.953, 0.897 and 0.902, showing a high linear correlation. Based on the analysis above, the data was streamlined using factor analysis for the 10 level 1 parameter. This paper is based on IBM SPSS Modeler software for factor analysis modeling, and Fig. 11 shows the factor analysis gravel plot. It can be seen from the figure that when the number of extracted common factors is greater than 3, the corresponding eigenvalues are reduced to below 1. At this time, the cumulative variance contribution of the 3 common factors is about 89 %, so the number of common factors to be extracted in this paper is 3. Table.7 shows the variance contribution statistics for each factor before and after rotation. The factors were rotated to optimize the extent to which each factor explained the original variables. It can be seen that only the first three factors have eigenvalues higher than 1 and the cumulative variance contribution of the first three factors has reached 89.172 %, so extracting the first three eigenvectors can already explain more than 90 % of the information contained in the 10 original variables. The three common factors extracted from Table.7 reflect more than 90 % of the information contained in the original variables, while the differences and links between the three common factors and the preferences and interpretations of the original information need to be understood in conjunction with the factor loading matrices. Table.8 presents the factor loading matrix derived from this factor analysis. The magnitude of the factor loadings reflects the extent to which information on the original variables is explained. There is a large difference in the degree of preference for the original variables among the three common factors. Common factor 1 can adequately account for the five variables of mainframe energy consumption, cooling tower energy consumption, cooling water inlet/outlet temperature, and condensing pressure, which is mainly closely related to the cooling characteristics on the mainframe side, and is named the Cooling factor. Common factor 2 adequately accounts for chilled water pump energy consumption and cooling water pump energy consumption and characterizes the delivery characteristics of the water system, which is named the Delivery factor. Common factor 3, which adequately accounts for chilled water supply/return temperatures and evaporative pressures and characterizes changes in end-user demand, is named the Load factor. Using the above three factors as input variables, the K-Means clustering algorithm was used to identify the operation mode of this central air conditioning system. To determine the value of K in the K-Means algorithm, different K values are selected for comparison in this paper. Using the profile factor as a measure, the optimum K value of 3 was finally determined as shown in Fig. 12 . Three modes of year-round operation exist for this central air-conditioning system, with distribution characteristics box plots for chilled water supply and return temperature differences, chilled water pump energy consumption, compressor energy consumption, and cooling water inlet and outlet temperature differences, as shown in Figs. 13 and 14 . Cluster-1 is the low-frequency mode of operation with small temperature differences and high flow rates during the non-air-conditioning season: it is mainly found during the non-air-conditioning season from January to April and during the low-temperature period from November to December, with the maximum ambient temperature of the operating days basically between 23 °C and 26 °C. The daily running time of the system is <5 h, accounting for about 15 % of the total annual running time. The temperature difference between the chilled water supply and return in this mode is <1 °C and the chilled water pump has the highest energy consumption of the year. Cluster-2 is the high-frequency mode of operation with large temperature differences and small flow rates during the air-conditioning season: it is mainly distributed during the air-conditioning season from May to November and the ambient temperature on the operating days is basically between 30 °C and 35 °C. The system runs for around 12 h a day, accounting for around 40 % of the total running time for the year. The chilled water supply and return temperature difference in this mode are higher than 2.5 °C and the chilled water pumps consume less energy. Cluster-3 is a high-frequency mode of operation with small temperature differences in the air conditioning season: mainly between April and November, with ambient temperatures between 26 °C and 30 °C on the operating days. The unified daily running time is around 8 h, accounting for 45 % of the total annual running time. This model has a chilled water supply and returns a temperature difference between 1 °C and 2.5 °C and low chilled water pump energy consumption. All three clusters of this water-cooled central air conditioner have varying degrees of energy-saving potential, and by optimizing the chilled water pump frequency control strategy the system's energy-efficient operating characteristics can be effectively ensured. For cluster-1, the chilled water supply and return temperature difference is<1 °C, which is only one-fifth of the design standard, at which point the pump energy consumption is bound to be much higher than the corresponding design standard value, resulting in additional wasted delivery energy. For cluster-1, the chilled water supply and the return temperature difference can be increased to 5 °C by reducing the chilled water flow, which reduces the energy consumption of the pumps by around 80 %. For cluster-2, the chilled water flow rate can be reduced to increase the chilled water supply and return the temperature difference to 5 °C, resulting in a reduction in chilled water pump energy consumption of approximately 40 %. Cluster-3 characterizes the high-frequency mode of operation with a small temperature difference in the air conditioning season, which reduces the chilled water flow and thus increases the chilled water supply and returns the temperature difference to 5 °C. The corresponding energy consumption of the chilled water pumps can be reduced by approximately 60 %. The above analysis shows that the energy-saving potential of the three modes is, in order of magnitude: low-frequency low-temperature differential operation in the non-air-conditioning season > medium-frequency medium-temperature differential operation in the non-air-conditioning season > high-frequency high-temperature differential operation in the air-conditioning season. 4.2 Energy-saving research 4.2.1 Energy-saving research based on the C5.0 algorithm The system EERr is used as the target variable, with each sub-efficiency as an input variable (including COP, WTFchw, and WTFcw). From Fig. 15 it can be seen that the decision tree model successively used COP and WTFchw as the best grouping variables (both with predictor variable importance of 0.85 and 0.15, respectively), resulting in a total of four valid energy efficiency diagnostic rules. Table.9 shows a list of the energy efficiency diagnostic rules derived from this algorithm. The confidence levels of the four energy efficiency diagnostic rules derived range from 96.5 % to 99.5 %, and the energy efficiency diagnostic scheme has a high degree of reliability. A comparison of the energy efficiency rules also shows that this energy efficiency diagnostic decision tree places different levels of requirements on COP and WTFchw respectively. Based on the energy efficiency rules for each component obtained from the above C5.0 decision tree algorithm, the following central air conditioning optimization strategy can be derived, as shown in Fig. 16 . 4.2.2 Energy-saving research based on CHAID algorithm The CHAID decision tree algorithm uses a chi-square test as its core to determine the best grouping variables and the best splitting points. This section uses EERr as the target variable and each sub-efficiency as the input variable (including COP, WTFchw, and WTFcw). The CHAID decision tree algorithm was used to study the energy efficiency diagnostic rules for this central air-conditioning system resulting in the decision tree model shown in Fig. 17 . Table 11 shows the list of energy efficiency diagnostic rules for this central air conditioner based on the CHAID algorithm. Based on the energy efficiency rules for each component obtained from the above CHAID decision tree algorithm, the following central air conditioning optimization strategy can be derived, as shown in Fig. 18 . 4.2.3 Model verification To verify the accuracy of the central air conditioning energy efficiency optimization strategy model proposed in this study, this section uses the operational data of this water-cooled central air conditioning system during a typical air conditioning season (April\u2013November) period in 2020 as the validation data set. As can be seen from Fig. 19 , the actual energy efficiency of the central air conditioner during a typical air-conditioning season in 2020 is overwhelmingly below the standard limit (approximately 75 % of the total operation), leaving much room for energy efficiency optimization. The processed 2020 data are optimized according to Fig. 16 (C5.0 decision tree algorithm) and Fig. 18 (CHAID decision tree algorithm) optimization process. The calculation of the optimization target variable (EERr) and the input variables (COP, WTFchw, WTFcw) are specified in \u2018Economic operation of air conditioning systems GB/T 17981-2007\u2032, as in Eq. (10)\u2013(13). At this point, the total power consumption of the air conditioning system can be derived from Eq. (14). (10) E E R r = Q ∑ N j (11) COP = Q N chiller (12) WT F chw = Q N chp (13) WT F cw = Q cw N cp (14) N total ≈ N chiller + N chp + N cp This section assumes that a central air conditioning system that does not meet the standard limits will improve COP, WTFchw, or WTFcw by changing certain parameters (e.g. increasing the heat transfer temperature difference, chilled water flow rate, etc.) by the optimization strategy derived above. the ultimate goal is to reduce the total power consumption of the air conditioning system while ensuring that the total cooling capacity of the central air conditioning system remains unchanged, improving the economy. 5 C5.0 decision tree algorithm The data for the non-standard energy efficiency date of 2020 are optimized based on the optimization strategy in Fig. 16. Fig. 20 shows the statistics of the energy efficiency grading distribution of the central air conditioning system obtained by using this optimization strategy. It can be seen that 90 % of the operating hours of the central air conditioning system operation COP do not reach the limited standard value (COP < 3.944). 1) In the historical records under 4 levels of COP, the distribution of primary WTFchw, secondary WTFchw, and tertiary WTFchw accounted for 37.6 %, 12.8 %, and 49.6 % respectively, so the energy savings after COP optimization based on a level-by-level WTFchw were 29156 kW·h, 10,088 kW·h and 37,728 kW·h respectively, so the total energy savings under this model The total energy savings from the energy efficiency optimization strategy are therefore 76,972 kW·h. 2) At this point in the history under level 3 COP, none of the WTFchw is a level 1 WTFchw (＜25.1) and the energy savings after the WTFchw based optimization strategy is 646 kW·h. 3) At this point in the history under the level 2 COP, the WTFchw are all in the level 3 WTFchw (＜20.65) and the energy savings after the WTFchw based optimization strategy is 565 kW·h. The total energy savings from the optimization strategy based on the C5.0 decision tree algorithm is 78,183 kW·h, which is 32.4 % of the total energy consumption. Based on the commercial electricity price in Shenzhen (RMB 0.7/kW·h), the total operating cost savings are approximately RMB 55,000. 6 CHAID decision tree algorithm The data for the non-standard energy efficiency date of 2020 are optimized based on the optimization strategy in Fig. 18. Fig. 21 shows the statistical chart of the energy efficiency grading distribution of the central air conditioning system obtained by using this optimization strategy. It can be seen that 90 % of the operating hours of the central air conditioning system operation COP do not reach the limit standard value (COP < 4.086). 1) In the historical record of 4 levels of COP, the percentages of primary WTFchw, secondary WTFchw and tertiary WTFchw are 36.1 %, 13.5 %, and 50.4 % respectively, then the energy savings after COP optimization based on the level-by-level WTFchw are 24239 kW·h, 10498 kW·h and 36500 kW·h respectively, and the total energy savings from this model of energy efficiency optimization The total energy savings from this model are 71,237 kW·h. 2) In all level 3 COP histories, the WTFchw was not a level 1 WTFchw (＜ 24.05) and the energy savings after the WTFchw based optimization strategy was 1412 kW·h. 3) In the history of the level 2 COP, WTFchw belongs to level 3 WTFchw, and the energy savings after the WTFchw based optimization strategy is 533 kW·h. The total energy savings after optimization is 73,182 kW·h, which is 30.3 % of the total energy consumption based on the CHDIA decision tree algorithm. Based on the commercial electricity price in Shenzhen (RMB 0.7/kW·h), the total cost savings would be approximately RMB 51,000. 7 Conclusion In this paper, we use the strong coupling correlation, complexity, and multi-dimensional and multi-volume characteristics of the central air conditioning operation data set to study the central air conditioning system operation mode identification using the K-Means algorithm, and analyze the operation data based on the decision tree algorithm to propose an energy-efficient optimization strategy plan. The 2020 central air-conditioning system operation data was used as validation data for model validation. (1) Based on the factor analysis method, the measured parameters of the central air conditioner can be extracted into three common factors: cooling factor, delivery factor, and load factor, which are independent of each other. (2) Using three common factors as input parameters, a K-Means clustering algorithm was used to conduct a pattern recognition study of central air conditioning, resulting in three different operation modes. These three exist with different degrees of energy-saving optimization potential. (3) Different decision tree algorithms were used to study the energy-efficient operation of central air-conditioning and to derive an energy-saving optimization strategy model. The model was validated using the 2020 data set, and the validation results met the energy-saving requirements.

        "dc:description": "Central air conditioning accounts for more than 40 % of the energy consumption of social buildings. Ensuring the efficient operation of central air conditioning at full working conditions has a positive impact on reducing the total energy consumption of society. In this paper, the historical operation data of central air conditioning in a commercial building in Shenzhen is used as the source and the energy-saving strategy of this central air conditioning system is studied using 2019 data as the main research data. Firstly, the measured parameters are extracted as the Cooling factor, Delivery factor, and Load factor based on factor analysis, and the K-Means algorithm is used as input parameters for pattern recognition of the central air conditioning system. Then, according to the results of pattern recognition, C5.0 and the CHAID decision tree algorithm are used to obtain the energy-saving strategy model. Finally, the 2020 operational data of the building's central air conditioning system was used as the validation data set for energy efficiency verification. The energy-saving strategy based on the C5.0 decision tree algorithm is calculated to save 78,183 kW·h, which is 32.4 % of the total energy consumption, and the energy-saving strategy based on the CHDIA decision tree algorithm is calculated to save 73,182 kW·h, which is 30.3 % of the total energy consumption.",
