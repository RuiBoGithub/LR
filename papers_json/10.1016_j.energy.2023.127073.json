Both model predictive control (MPC) and deep reinforcement learning control (DRL) have been presented as a way to approximate the true optimality of a dynamic programming problem, and these two have shown significant operational cost saving potentials for building energy systems. However, there is still a lack of in-depth quantitative studies on their approximation levels to the true optimality, especially in the building energy domain. To fill in the gap, this paper provides a numerical framework that enables the evaluation of the optimality levels of different controllers for building energy systems. This framework is then used to comprehensively compare the optimal control performance of both MPC and DRL controllers with given computation budgets for a single zone fan coil unit system. Note the optimality is estimated based on a user-specific selection of trade-off weights among energy costs, thermal comfort and control slew rates. Compared with the best optimality we can find through expensive optimization simulations, the best DRL agent can maximally approximate the optimality by 96.54%, which outperforms the best MPC whose optimality level is 90.11%. However, due to the stochasticity, the DRL agent is only expected to approximate the optimality by 90.42%, which is almost equivalent to the best MPC. Except for Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), all DRL agents can have a better approximation to the optimality than the best MPC, and are expected to have better approximation than the MPC with a prediction horizon of 32 steps (15 min per step). In terms of reducing energy cost and thermal discomfort, MPC can outperform the rule-based control (RBC) by 18.47%\u201325.44%. DRL can be expected to outperform RBC by 18.95%\u201325.65% ,and the best DRL control policy can outperform RBC by 20.29%\u201329.72%. Although the comparison of the optimality level is performed in a perfect setting, e.g., MPC assumes perfect models, and DRL assumes a perfect offline training process and online deployment process, this can shed insight on their capabilities of approximating to the original dynamic programming problem.

S. primary energy use and associated greenhouse gas emissions [2]. Numerous studies have reported that well-designed Heating, Ventilation, Air-conditioning (HVAC) control could significantly reduce the energy use and mitigate emissions of greenhouse gases, see, e.g. [3,4]. Currently the majority of the buildings still are operated under simple rule-based control (RBC) logic with relatively limited energy saving capabilities [4,5]. The American Society of Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) are promoting ASHRAE Guideline 36, which provides high-performance control sequences for HVAC systems based on the best-in-the-class industry practices. These sequences are complex rule-based, and have been demonstrated to achieve 17.3% of annual HVAC energy savings against the conventional simple rule-based strategies [6]. Advanced control strategies such as model predictive control (MPC) and reinforcement learning control (RL) or deep reinforcement learning control (DRL) have gained wide attentions in the building research domain in recent years. MPC can achieve high control performance by solving a real-time optimization problem at each step that minimizes the energy use and meets reasonable thermal comfort requirements [7]. Many MPC strategies have been reported for the control of HVAC systems to achieve energy efficiency goals [8,9] or incorporate demand response objectives [10\u201313]. The main benefit of MPC is a systematic thermal comfort improvement with simultaneous energy savings spanning from 15% up to 50% demonstrated on numerous simulation and several pilot case studies [8\u201315]. Despite the intensive research efforts, transferring MPC to the practice is still in its early stages, due to its cumbersome design and online computational requirements etc. [16]. DRL has gained increasing interests in building controls because of its successful application to other areas such as gaming [17,18] and robotics [19]. DRL has advantages over MPC in its model-free feature, that is, a DRL agent can directly interact with an environment to learn the best control policies over time. Many numerical and experimental researches have been conducted in the past years to explore the potential of DRL control in building energy system. Wei et al. [20] applied a deep Q-learning (DQN) controller to a multi-zone office building, which demonstrated energy cost savings ranging from 5% up to about 70% compared with RBC. Schreiber et al. [21] applied DQN and DDPG algorithms to a cooling supply system control for load shifting under varying energy price, and a 14% cost saving was observed from a numerical study. Zhang et al. [22] deployed a DRL controller to an existing radiant heating system of an office building. Their 78-day onsite deployment test showed a 17.6% heat demand reduction compared with a RBC. Unlike other areas where the DRL tasks are typically characterized by the simulated environment (e.g., Atari games), deterministic rules and discrete actions (e.g., Go) and repeatability (e.g., robot manipulation), real work control tasks like building energy system are seldom deterministic due to the stochastic disturbances (e.g., weather and occupant behaviors, etc.) and non-repeatable. Therefore, a notorious disadvantage of DRL in building control is the need for years-long training time. Since both MPC and DRL are alternatives to approximate the exact solutions of a dynamic optimal control problem, and can provide promising suboptimal solutions for building energy systems, it is of research interest to understand their advantages and disadvantages before deployments in real buildings. Section 2 and Table 2 describe in details their known similarities and differences from the optimal control point of view. A brief summary is also provided here to understand the motivations behind this research. The differences lie in three aspects in general. First, MPC requires a model of the plant and relies on an efficient formulation of its optimization problem, while DRL can be model-free and can work well with non-convex non-smooth reward designs. Second, MPC (except for explicit MPC) requires online computation that may require advanced powerful hardware for real-time applications, while the offline-trained DRL results in portable neural network models that need little online computation. Third, MPC has a mature control theory established while DRL, due to its black-box feature, lacks theory support. Besides these well-known differences, we are particularly interested in the optimality level that MPC and DRL can achieve for building energy systems as an approximation of the true optimality from solving Bellman\u2019s optimality equation using dynamic programming (see Section 2). More specifically, we want to answer two questions when minimizing the cost function: (1) when there are no modeling errors, is MPC or DRL better in achieving the minimum cost? (2) when there are modeling errors, which one of MPC and DRL can achieve a lower cost? Current literature has not fully resolved the above two questions for building energy systems. Nagy et al. [25] compared two DRL algorithms (model-based and model-free) in simulations against an idealized MPC and a RBC. Since the MPC formulation assumed perfect knowledge of the system dynamics, the MPC control performance served as the upper limit in their study and outperformed both DRL algorithms. Arroyo et al. [26] compares the performance of an MPC (using a reduced-order model with modeling errors) and an offline-trained DDQN agent (with and without modeling errors) for a heat pump system. The offline-trained DDQN agent with modeling errors led to catastrophic temperature violations during the deployment test and behaved worse than their MPC counterpart. The DDQN without modeling errors seemed not to be fined-tuned but instead adopted an existing set of hyper-parameters from other experiments. Moreover, the learned controller was not explicitly compared with the MPC in terms of total rewards. Brandi et al. [27] provided comparisons between MPC and DRL agents for a chiller and tank system, considering scenarios with and without modeling errors in online and offline training. The study shows that MPC outperformed the other controllers in all the scenarios in terms of energy cost. However, there are two limitations: First, the MPC objective function and the DRL reward function were not consistently formulated, which cast doubts on the comparison results. Secondly, it is unclear if the DRL algorithms were explicitly tuned to unleash the full potential of DRL for control. While the above literature has explored the comparisons with great efforts, we can still see the difficulties when performing fair comparisons among expertise-intensive control algorithms. One major challenge is guaranteeing fairness, which reveals the following research gaps: \u2022 The scenario design for controller comparisons is mostly not thoroughly defined. For example, comparing the control performance of a control policy learnt from an error-free model with that of a control policy relying on an error-prone model may be feasible but inconvincible to answer either question (1) or question (2). Comparison scenario should be carefully defined by considering the specific comparison goals, and the nature of training and testing process, etc. \u2022 The unintentionally introduced bias during the tuning process of the advanced controllers may lead to unfair conclusions. Authors tend to only fine-tune the controllers that they have expertise in, which may undermine the performance of other controllers in their study. \u2022 The influence of consistent objective design on the control performance of different controllers are typically neglected. For example, most research considers energy cost and temperature violations as the minimization goal. The optimality for this multi-objective optimization highly depends on the user-specified trade-off weights. Mathematically, the optimizer can find different optimum points when the weights are different, and they all could be considered as the \u201coptimal solution\u201d but subject to the given weights. In this sense, comparisons between two different controllers with different trade-off weights may not be fair. To assist answering the raised questions and to bridge the gap of comparing MPC and DRL in building energy system, this research has the following major contributions: \u2022 A containerized framework for building control performance comparison, especially with a focus on optimal control and learning-based control for standardized building environments is proposed and developed. This framework leverages the development of Functional Mock-up Unit (FMU) for generic dynamic modeling and simulation, which can be flexibly extended to integrate with user-specific simulation environments that support FMU exporting. This is one of the key features that differ from the existing framework known as BOPTEST [28], whose interface is tailored mainly for Modelica models. \u2022 The model-based optimal control and DRL control integrated with auto machine learning (autoML) techniques can automatically perform offline training of both MPC and DRL algorithms that typically requires significant expertise for hyperparameter tuning. A FMU-based optimal control framework is also established for calculating the \u201ctrue\u201d optimality of the original optimal control problem, and obtaining the best suboptimal solution that an MPC can get without modeling errors. Note that the optimality gaps introduced by the solver for the optimization problems is not investigated here. \u2022 Besides the known differences, we preliminarily demonstrated that in terms of approaching the Bellman\u2019s optimality, the best DRL with error-free models can outperform simulation-based nonlinear MPC with the same error-free models by about 6.5% in terms of the same objective, while they are expected to have similar performance. This conclusion enriches current literature, and can provide a different insight when discussing the optimality level of both controllers. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 summarizes the known similarities and differences of MPC and DRL from the point of view of solving an optimal control problem. Section 3 introduces a scalable containerized framework for advanced comparison of MPC and DRL, and Section 4 presents a in-depth case study to demonstrate the capability of this framework to investigate the optimality level of MPC and four popular DRL algorithms in a simulated single zone environment. To generate the control performance benchmark data for both controllers, significant tuning was conducted. We finally concluded this paper in Section 5. 2 MPC vs RL This section first illustrates a typical multiple-stage optimal control problem and its optimal solutions in the format of Bellman\u2019s equation. This is the basic optimal control problem that MPC and RL try to solve. Section 2.2 summarizes the common terminology used in the control domain when discussing optimal control problems, and their counterparts in RL-related discussions. Section 2.3 summarizes the known differences between MPC and RL. 2.1 Optimal control formulation This section illustrates how to analytically obtain solutions for a typical N -stage optimal control problem. For simplicity, we start from a discrete-time finite horizon optimal control problem (FHOCP), which is also widely used in building energy controls. (1a) J 0 ∗ ( x 0 ) = min u k k = 0 , \u2026 , N − 1 J ( x 0 ; u 0 , \u2026 , u N − 1 ) = g N ( x N ) + ∑ k = 0 N − 1 g k ( x k , u k ) (1b) s . t . x k + 1 = f k ( x k , u k ) , k = 0 , \u2026 , N − 1 (1c) x k ∈ X ⊆ R n , k = 1 , \u2026 , N (1d) u k ∈ U ⊆ R m , k = 0 , \u2026 , N − 1 (1e) x 0 = x ( 0 ) Solving the problem is to find the optimal controls u ∗ ⊆ R m that can lead to the optimal system performance from the measured states x ⊆ R n . This problem is to minimize the total cost J over all control sequences { u 0 , \u2026 , u N − 1 } for a given initial state x 0 . The total cost function J ( ⋅ ) has two additive terms: an accumulative stage cost g k ( ⋅ ) incurred at time k ( k ∈ [ 1 , \u2026 , N − 1 ] ), and a terminal cost g N ( ⋅ ) incurred at the end of the process. f k is a general state space model as a function of ( x k , u k ) , representing the nonlinear or linear plant dynamics. We denote x ( t ) and x t as the measured and predicted state vector at discrete time t , respectively. X,U are the feasible sets for the systems states and control actions. N is the stage, and J is the estimated total cost in the future N stages. One classical approach to solve the above optimal control problem is dynamic programming (DP), that uses the cost function to organize and structure the search for good control policies. We define as follows the cost function for the ( N − k ) -stage tail subproblem that starts at state x k and time k , and ends at time N : (2) J k ( x k ; u k , \u2026 , u N − 1 ) = g N ( x N ) + ∑ m = k N − 1 g m ( x m , u m ) which holds for k = 0 , \u2026 , N − 1 . Rearranging Eq. (2) yields to: (3) J k ( x k ; u k , \u2026 , u N − 1 ) = γ k g k ( x k , u k ) + g N ( x N ) + ∑ m = k + 1 N − 1 γ m g m ( x m , u m ) = g k ( x k , u k ) + J k + 1 ( x k + 1 ; u k + 1 , \u2026 , u N − 1 ) The optimal cost for the ( N − k ) -stage tail subproblem is: (4) J k ∗ ( x k ) = min u m m = k , \u2026 , N − 1 J k ( x k ; u k , \u2026 , u N − 1 ) Using the principle of optimality that is the tail of an optimal sequence is optimal for the tail subproblem on Eq. (3) and (4) can get: (5) J k ∗ ( x k ) = min u m m = k , \u2026 , N − 1 [ g k ( x k , u k ) + min u m m = k + 1 , \u2026 , N − 1 J k + 1 ( x k + 1 ; u k + 1 , \u2026 , u N − 1 ) ] = min u m m = k , \u2026 , N − 1 g k ( x k , u k ) + J k + 1 ∗ ( f k ( x k , u k ) ) where J k + 1 ∗ the cost-to-go function. DP solves every tail problem as denoted by the above equation backward to get the cost function of its original problem J 0 ∗ after sequentially obtaining J N ∗ , J N − 1 ∗ , \u2026 , J 1 ∗ . The optimal control sequence { u 0 ∗ , \u2026 , u N − 1 ∗ } can then be constructed forward when the cost functions J 0 ∗ , \u2026 , J N ∗ are available using Eq. (5). Instead of obtaining the optimal control sequences, we can also obtain an explicit control policy π = { μ 0 , \u2026 , μ N − 1 } where μ k maps states x k into controls u k = μ k ( x k ) , and satisfies the control constraints as in Eq. (1d). The optimal policy π ∗ is one that minimizes the total cost; i.e., (6) π ∗ = arg min π g k ( x k , μ k ( x k ) ) + J k + 1 ∗ ( f k ( x k , μ k ( x k ) ) ) The infinite horizon optimal control problem (IHOCP) has a similar formulation as FHOCP but with the stage N = ∞ . For the IHOCP, Eq. (5) can be transformed to a discounted problem, as follows. (7) J k ∗ ( x k ) = min u m m = k , \u2026 , N − 1 g k ( x k , u k ) + γ J k + 1 ∗ ( f k ( x k , u k ) ) where γ ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) is a discount factor that is used to transform the infinite horizon problem to a discounted problem. γ can be considered as 1 in the FHOCP. However, obtaining J k ∗ by DP is often prohibitively time-consuming because the number of possible x k and k can be very large, also known as the \u201ccurse-of-dimensionality\u201d. This has motivated approximate dynamic programming (ADP) that results in a more tractable computation, but yields a suboptimal policy [29]. There are major two approaches for ADP. The first is approximation in value space, where we approximate the optimal cost-to-go functions J k + 1 ∗ ( ⋅ ) with some other functions J ̃ k + 1 ( ⋅ ) . The suboptimal control u ̃ k and π ̃ can be obtained from Eqs. (6) and (7). The other is approximation in policy space, whereby the policy is selected by using an optimization over a suitably restricted class of policies, usually a parametric family of some form. These two approaches are possible to be combined together. Implicit MPC is an online optimization-based value approximation method, while explicit MPC can be considered as a policy approximation method. When without a special notation, MPC in this paper refers to implicit MPC. More details about the difference between MPC and RL are discussed in the following section (see Fig. 1). 2.2 Terminology This section summarizes the substantial terminology differences between DP-based discussions and RL-based discussions. DP-based discussions typically use terminology from the control domain, while RL-based discussions use artificial intelligence-related terminology. One of the key differences is the typical use of minimization/cost function/cost per stage in the DP-based discussions and the use of maximization/value function/reward in the RL-based discussions. Table 1 summarizes some key terminology in optimal control problem and their counterparts in RL. The rest of this paper use DP-based terminology (same in MPC context) when discussing MPC and RL-based terminology when discussing DRL. 2.3 Known differences MPC reduces the computation in DP by truncating the time horizon, and using at each stage a decision based on lookahead of a small number of stages. The infinity future cost function is approximated implicitly by the sum of the approximated cost functions in a finite horizons at each step by online computing the future loss starting from a given state with a rolling horizon. MPC typically solves the FHOCP with a discount factor γ of 1 for the measured state vector x ( 0 ) to obtain the optimal control action sequence { u 0 ∗ , \u2026 , u N − 1 ∗ } , applying the first element of the optimal control sequences to the system and observing the updated states. This predictive control procedure is repeated with the updated states at each time step with a receding horizon. MPC requires a sufficiently accurate model of the plant dynamics, and performs online estimation of the cost function based on the models, which usually leads to a high online complexity. However, MPC, especially linear MPC (LMPC) that is characterized by the use of linear model, has a mature stability, feasibility and robustness theory as well as an inherent constraint handling scheme. Unlike LMPC where the optimization problem could be convex and thus a global optimization solution is guaranteed, the nonlinear MPC (NMPC) is not necessarily convex anymore, which poses challenges for both NMPC stability theory and numerical solutions. Solving the IHOCP is also possible for LMPC as a linear quadratic regulator problem, where it has been proven that there is a finite horizon prediction horizon N ¯ ( x ( t ) ) such that for all prediction horizons N ≥ N ¯ ( x ( t ) ) the FHOCP and the IHOCP are equivalent [24,30]. A classic formulation of MPC is not adaptive as formulated in Eq. (1), but can be integrated with adaptation to model the uncertainty while the estimator is evolving. The resulting control policy is implicitly defined by repeating the optimization calculation after a feedback update of the state at each sample time. By employing an online optimization approach, it circumvents the problem of having to solve the Bellman\u2019s optimality equation, which may not be solved analytically for nonlinear systems and/or in the presence of inequality constraints. The offline complexity of MPC in the application of buildings is tackled by formulating the MPC problem and identifying the MPC models, which requires intensive expertise. RL reduces the computation in DP by approximating explicitly the Bellman\u2019s optimality via a parametric approximation architecture, such as neural networks. Instead of using a shallow architecture to approximate the value function and control policy, DRL utilizes deep (multi-layer) neural nets. DRL solves the IHOCP by generating a state feedback control policy π for the observed state x ( t ) , applying the control actions u ( t ) to the system, measuring the next state vector x ( t + 1 ) , evaluating the cost g ( x ( t + 1 ) , u ( t + 1 ) ) , and improving the control policy π based on the evaluation. This is repeated for each discrete time step. The improvement of control policy relies on two approximation approaches: one is the value approximation, where RL approximates the true optimal value J k + 1 ∗ ( x k + 1 , u k + 1 ) with a function of a given parametric form J ̃ k + 1 ( x k + 1 , u k + 1 , θ k + 1 ) , and θ v is a parameter vector. The other is the policy approximation, where RL approximates the true optimal policy π ∗ ( x k ) with a parametric function π ̃ ( x k , θ π ) , where θ π is a parameter vector. Those parameter vectors are usually tuned to maintain the accuracy of the approximation through a learning process. For DRL, a model of the environment as in Eq. (1b) is not necessary, which characterizes the classical RL as a model-free control approach. Unlike MPC, RL is inherently adaptive to system noises due to its capability of learning and attempts to derive an explicit state feedback control policy. RL for control generally has an immature stability, feasibility and robustness theory as well as constraint handling. Note the stability here refers to the control stability of a closed loop system as defined in the control community, not the stability, or more precisely convergence, of the learning algorithms. Although constraint handling is not inherently within the DRL formulation (due to the ignorance of the terminal cost in Eq. (2)), it has been actively studied under the concept of safe DRL. Popular DRL algorithms typically uses parameterized deep neural networks to approximate the value function and/or the control policy. DQN, as the first popular DRL algorithm, enhances a classic RL algorithm called Q-Learning with deep neural networks and a technique called experience replay. DDQN leverages the Q-learning technique to find the optimal policy by iteratively approximating the action-value function known as Q-value in RL by two deep neural networks. Quantile Regression DQN (QRDQN) builds on DQN and make use of a quantile regression to explicitly model the distribution over returns, instead of predicting the mean return in DQN. PPO is a policy gradient method for RL, where the policy is parameterized in a way that is differentiable with regards to its parameters. The parameters are then learned by gradient-based methods such as the gradient descent method. Soft actor\u2013critic (SAC) includes three key parts: an actor\u2013critic architecture with separates policy and value function approximation networks, an off-policy formulation that enables reuse of previously collected data for efficiency, and entropy maximization to encourage stability and exploration. Its actor\u2013critic structure learns approximations to both policy and value functions, where \u2018actor\u2019 is a reference to the learned policy, and \u2018critic\u2019 refers to the learned value function, usually a state-value function. Note policy approximation has also been integrated into MPC, known as differentiable MPC or explicit MPC. This type of MPC, similar to DRL, requires significantly offline computational complexity to train the policy model. The known similarities and differences are summarized in Table 2. 3 Containerized framework for building control performance comparison Fig. 2 describes the components of the proposed building energy control testbed that leverages the latest development of containerization techniques [31]. The building environments and their controllers are packaged and deployed in a Docker container [32] that provides a base software development environment using a lightweight Ubuntu operation system and a high-level programming language Python. More detailed implementation can be found in Ref. [31], and our open-source library at https://github.com/BE-HVACR/FMU-DRL-DOCKER. This framework is scalable in the following two aspects. First, any EnergyPlus models and Modelica models that can be exported as Functional Mock-up Unit (FMU) are able to be easily integrated within this framework with the help of our data exchange interface, FMU-Gym. This interface is built on Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) [33] and OpenGym [34] definitions. Therefore, it can effortlessly expand any FMU models to be compatible with most of the state-of-the-art DRL libraries. Second, the framework is containerized, which can serve as a standalone application that runs on any modern computer and a variety of locations such as a cloud without modifications. 3.1 Virtual building environments Three types of building modeling environments are supported in this framework: Modelica [35,36], EnergyPlus [37] and Spawn of EnergyPlus [38]. All of them currently support the exporting of dynamic building energy system models as a Co-Simulation Functional Mockup Unit (FMU). The containerized testbed currently consists of a list of building environments in FMUs, including a single zone building with a fan coil system [39], a single zone building with a direct expansion coil system, and a five zone building with a chiller plant system [40]. The details of the single zone building with a fan coil system is described in Section 4. The system disturbances such as energy prices, weather conditions and occupancy schedules etc. can be flexibly integrated according to the user\u2019s needs. 3.2 Advanced controllers The advanced controllers include two packages: one is optimal control such as MPC, and the other is learning-based control such as DRL. The containerized controllers are developed in Python. The optimal control package contains a list of reduced-order building models to support realistic MPC development and model-based DRL development only, including zone air temperature dynamic models, steady-state power model and disturbance predictors for outdoor air temperature, etc. The open-source optimization framework CasADi [41] is also contained within the optimal control package to formulate and solve control-related optimization problems. An MPC problem is formulated and solved using this package for a containerized building environment, and detailed in Section 4. The learning-based package contains a list of the state-of-the-art standard DRL libraries such as Tianshou [42]. Due to the great concerns about the training time of DRL on building energy systems as reported in Table 5 and Ref. [21], the capability of integrating other DRL solutions such as transfer learning, unsupervised pretraining, or leveraging abstract physical models to accelerate the DRL training are also possible under the modular design. For example, we utilized a reduced-order model of zone air temperature in this framework to speed up the DDQN training by 8.8 times [39]. 3.3 Auto machine learning The DRL algorithms typically contain a set of hyper-parameters that control the behavior of the learning algorithm in some way, often in a way that is highly specific to that algorithm. The performance of the DRL algorithms therefore is critically dependent on these hyper-parameters\u2019 settings. Tuning DRL hyper-parameters often requires practitioner\u2019s expertise in both algorithms and physics behind the controlled environment, which is very resource-intensive to achieve applicable results. We leverage the recent development of open-source auto machine learning packages Ray [43,44] to automatically tune DRL and MPC algorithms using distributed clusters in this study. 4 Case study This section demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed container framework in terms of evaluations of the optimality level of MPC and DRL. For a fair comparison, we evaluate the MPC and DRL performance based on (1) the same virtual building energy system; (2) the same weights for energy cost, zone thermal comfort and control action changes; (3) a perfect MPC formulation using error-free models; (4) a perfect offline training procedure for DRL algorithms with the presence of error-free models. The building control environment and an ad-hoc baseline RBC are described in Section 4.1. The MPC and DRL formulations are presented in Section 4.3 and Section 4.4, respectively. The perfect training and deployment process for both MPC and DRL controllers are illustrated in Section 4.5. The essential tuning for the advanced controllers in their training process is demonstrated in Section 4.6. The control performance during the deployment process is compared analyzed and in Section 4.7. 4.1 Building environment: Single zone with fan coil unit system The single zone building is defined as a heavyweight construction known as case900FF, which is part of the Building Energy Simulation Test validation suite [45]. The wall and floor constructions have heavy materials. The floor dimensions are 6 m-by-8 m and the floor-to-ceiling height is 2.7 m. There are four exterior walls facing the cardinal directions and a flat roof. The walls facing east\u2013west have the short dimension. The south wall contains two windows, each 3 m wide and 2 m tall. The use of the building is assumed to be a two-person office with a light load density. The building is assumed to be located at Chicago, Illinois, USA, and the Typical Meteorological Year 3 data [46] is used for the simulation. Cooling and heating are provided to this zone using an idealized fan coil unit (FCU) system. The FCU contains a fan, a cooling coil, a heating coil, and a filter. There is a variable speed drive serving the fan motor. The cooling coil is served by the chilled water providing cooling source with a constant efficiency and a constant supply chilled water temperature. The heating coil is served by hot water produced by a gas boiler. For simplicity, we only considered a cooling scenario in this case study. A baseline thermostat controller provides cooling as necessary to the room by modulating the supply air temperature and fan speed to maintain the zone air temperature setpoint. The zone air cooling setpoint is set to 24 °C for occupied hours and 30 °C for unoccupied hours, and the heating setpoint is set to 22 °C for occupied hours and 12 °C for unoccupied hours. For the cooling case, we simplify the control by fixing the supply air temperature setpoint at 14 ℃ and deactivate the heating coil control. The fan speed is regulated by a Proportional\u2013Integral controller that takes the errors between the zone temperature and the zone temperature setpoint as inputs. For MPC and DRL controllers, the measurement sampling rate is set to 1 min, and the control step is set to 15 min. The environment has the following standard settings: Action space. For the MPC controller, we assume the control action space is continuous. For the DRL controller, the building energy environment can receive both continuous and discrete control actions as different DRL algorithms may have different requirements of the environment\u2019s action space. For example, DDQN is originally designed to control environments with discrete actions, while SAC can be applied to continuous space. The discrete action space consists of 51 control actions that represent different levels of supply air fan speed, ranging from 0 to 1 with an increment of 0.02. The continuous action means the fan speed can be any value that falls in [0, 1]. Loss function. The loss function for the optimal control problem is the same for MPC and DRL, which include three terms: energy cost, thermal comfort and action slew rate. We include an action slew rate constraint to avoid frequent action changes from both MPC and model-free DRL. Such frequent action changes are detrimental to actuators. MPC and DRL all have the same weights for each of the three terms to perform a sufficiently fair comparisons in terms of the final control performance. 4.2 Optimal control problem formulation The original N -stage optimal control problem can be established as Eq. (8) for a time period [ t s , t e ] . This problem can be implemented using the shooting method, e.g., single shooting method and multiple shooting method [47]. The single shooting method minimizes the cost function by guessing the control variables for each time step based on the given initial conditions at the start time, while the multiple shooting method minimizes the cost function by guessing the control variables and initial conditions at each time step and matching the initial conditions at the current step to the final conditions at its previous step. We chose the single-shooting method in this research due to its ease of implementation in CasADi. This problem is only solved once at the start time t = t s , and generates a sequence of N optimal control actions for the whole period. These N control actions are directly applied to their corresponding N stages, respectively. The true optimal control solution can be obtained by applying DP to this problem, which requires a prohibitively large amount of computation resources. In this research, instead of DP, the optimizer using the primal\u2013dual interior-point method is used to solve the N -stage optimal control problem. The obtained solution is on the interior of set described by the inequality constraints and close to the true optimal solution. Hereinafter, we refer this solution as OPT, which represents the best optimality we can find and is used to benchmark the optimality level of MPC and DRL. However, we should note that the exactly true optimality cannot be guaranteed as our resulting optimization problem is always nonlinear and may also be non-convex, and there lacks a \u201cperfect\u201d optimizer that can guarantee its optimality with limited computation budgets. Such a limitation is discussed at the end of this paper. (8a) min u t J t ( x ( t ) , u t ) = w 1 \u2016 c t \u2016 1 Δ t + w 2 \u2016 ϵ t \u2016 2 2 + w 3 \u2016 Δu t \u2016 2 2 s . t . (8b) x t = x ( t ) (8c) x t + k + 1 = F M U ( x t + k , u t + k , T o a , t + k , q ̇ s , t + k ) , k = 0 , \u2026 , N − 1 (8d) P t + k + 1 = F M U ( x t + k , u t + k , T o a , t + k , q ̇ s , t + k ) , k = 0 , \u2026 , N − 1 (8e) T ̲ z , t + k − ϵ t + k ≤ T z , t + k ≤ T ¯ z , t + k + ϵ t + k , k = 0 , \u2026 , N − 1 (8g) c t = { p t P t , \u2026 , p t + N − 1 P t + N − 1 } ϵ t = { ϵ t , \u2026 , ϵ t + N − 1 } (8h) u t = { u t , \u2026 , u t + N − 1 } (8i) u ̲ ≤ u t + k ≤ u ¯ , k = 0 , \u2026 , N − 1 (8j) Δu t = { u t + 1 − u t , \u2026 , u t + N − 1 − u t + N − 2 } In the above formulation, Eq. (8a) is the objective that minimizes the total energy cost, the zone air temperature violations and the slew rate of control signals. The energy cost c is the product of the energy price p , the power consumption P , and the control interval Δ t . The temperature violation is quantified by a slack variable, ϵ , which is a vector of zone air temperature violations over the N states as defined in Eq. (8g). Through out this research, we use ϵ ∈ [ 0 , 0 . 5 ] °C to softly constrain the allowable violations on the temperature bounds. The slew rate of control signals, Δu t , is defined as the control oscillations at time t . w 1 , 2 , 3 are tunable weights, \u2016 ⋅ \u2016 1 is the l 1 -norm, and \u2016 ⋅ \u2016 2 is the l 2 -norm of the corresponding vectors. u is a vector of the control actions over the stages N as defined in Eq. (8h). Eq. (8b) is the initialization of system state vector x t at the current time step t . The system states include zone air temperature, and wall temperature etc. Eqs. (8c) and (8d) are the perfect model for predicting the system states and power at the next step, where T o a , q ̇ s are the outdoor air temperature and solar radiation, respectively. This perfect model is the same model as the system, saved as a FMU, and has a set of implicit nonlinear equations. Eq. (8e) is the zone air temperature constraints, where the . ̲ and . ¯ are the lower and upper limit, respectively. Eqs. (8h) and (8i) represents the bounds of the controllable variables. 4.3 MPC formulation The detailed MPC formulation is same as Eq. (8) but solved differently. Instead of solving the optimization problem only once at the beginning, MPC repeatedly solves a receding H -stage optimal control problem to approximate the true optimal solution of the original N -stage problem, where H is less than N . As the MPC uses a perfect model of the plant, all the system states are observable and thus there is no need for a dedicated state design as in DRL. The pseudo code is shown in Algorithm 1. This formulation eventually leads to a nonlinear optimization problem. At each step, the optimization problem is solved using the primal\u2013dual interior-point algorithm. 4.4 DRL controller formulation For DRL formulation, the current state x(t) of this environment contains historical measurements, current measurements and future disturbances through predictions. The detailed summary of each observation is shown in Table 3. The time index is represented by the elapsing seconds of a day, starting from 0 s and ending at 86400 s. Key measurements at the current time step and in the past such as zone air temperature, outdoor air temperature, solar radiation and power consumption are available by installed sensors. Predictions of near-future disturbances such as outdoor air temperature, solar radiation, energy prices are assumed to be perfect. In this paper, k in Table 3 is chosen as 4, which means one hour in the time span and leads to 26 observations in total for each time step. The reward at time t for DRL controller negates the step cost in MPC as shown below: (9) R t = − ( w 1 p t P t Δ t + w 2 ϵ t 2 + w 3 Δ u t 2 ) 4.5 MPC and DRL training and deployment The implicit MPC in this paper does not require offline training (e.g., system identification, etc.) as it directly uses the perfect model for optimization. The MPC is solved online over the deployment period. For DRL, we generally train the agent offline using a perfect model of the building energy system over the training period. The training period, also identified as episodes, is repeated multiple times so that the agent can explore different control policies in order to identify the optimal one. The learned control policy is then applied to the virtual building environment during the deployment period, where the parameters of the control policy are not updated. This offline training and online deployment process takes advantages of the presence of a perfect building model, and transforms the non-repeatable building control environment to a repeatable and episodic control problem. Together with using the same period for training and deployment, we can potentially obtain the upper bounds for the DRL control performance. In this research, for both MPC and DRL, the training and deployment periods are chosen as a typical week in July using the typical weather in Chicago, IL. Therefore, for our DRL training, one episode has 672 control steps. 4.6 MPC and DRL tuning The common tunable parameters for MPC and DRL are the weights that balance the priorities among those three terms in the loss function. Different settings of weights lead to different optimal solutions, and those optimal solutions are not directly comparable as they generally serve as the Pareto front for a multi-objective optimization problem. Therefore, there is no unanimous agreement on how to optimally choose the weights for different objectives except that such a choice should be user-specific. This research set the weights for energy cost, temperature violation penalty and slew rate penalty to [100, 1, 10]. This setting prioritizes energy cost reductions as typical building operators may care. The only tunable parameters in a perfect MPC is the H . Theoretically, MPC is a suboptimal solution, and the larger the H is the better suboptimal solutions can be. However, the computational time of MPC grows exponentially with the increase of H . Although this paper has no need for an online optimization, the time for the simulation-based predictive optimization utilizing high-fidelity Modelica models could be prohibitive as shown in Table 5. The computational time was measured at a personal computer with Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-9500 CPU @ 3.00 GHz. Generally, the longer the prediction horizon is, the more computational time the MPC requires. For example, with H = 96 , that is, 1-day ahead in this paper, the computation time for a 7-day experiment is around 23 days, which is about 10\u201320 times longer than the offline DRL training time with 500 episodes. The long computational time for \u201cperfect\u201d MPC is due to the nonlinear and non-differentiable Modelica models used in the optimization, which requires significant time to evaluate the derivatives of the loss function using the finite difference method. With a limited computational budget, we chose H from 4 (i.e., 1 h) to 96 (i.e., 24 h) as shown in Table 5. With H = 96 , MPC assumes the control decisions in future 96 steps will have influences on the control decisions for the current step, which is fairly aligned with the assumption in DRL algorithms with a discount factor λ = 0 . 99 , that is, at most 1 1 − λ = 100 step-ahead rewards will be considered to have influences on the DRL\u2019s current value estimation. DRL algorithms are mostly sensitive to hyper-parameters. The algorithms considered in this paper include DDQN, QRDQN, PPO and SAC. Table 4 shows the tunable parameters used in this paper and the final parameters we chose that can deliver the desired learning capability. The reward discount factor λ for each DRL algorithm is set to 0.99. The optimizer is chosen as Adam due to its wide use in DRL algorithms. The hyper-parameter are auto-tuned in a high performance computing cluster using the auto machine learning package as described in Section 3.3. We terminate the training of DRL agents when the maximum computational budget (e.g., 500 episodes) is reached. The hyper-parameter tuning is performed at the university\u2019s high performance computing clusters. 4.7 Simulation results and discussions For each DRL algorithm, due to the use of stochastic operators, we run six experiments, as in [48], using the \u201cbest\u201d parameters found from tuning. The following discussions are based on the best reward among the six runs that can represent the maximum potential a certain DRL algorithm can reach, and the average reward over the six runs that can represent the expectation of a certain DRL. 4.7.1 Comparison of learning performance Fig. 3 shows the learning curve of each DRL agent. The other non-DRL controllers are not learning-based, thus can be considered as having a constant learning curve. The SAC agent was trained on a continuous action space and learned the fastest an optimal policy that approaches the best MPC. All six random runs to train the SAC can generate better rewards than the RBC in only one episode, and converge to an almost equivalent optimality level as the MPC with H = 32 in four episodes. Both QRDQN and DDQN were trained on a discrete action space, and had a similar learning convergence. DDQN and QRDQN needed around 195 episodes (e.g., ∼ 130K steps) to stably outperform the best MPC, but QRDQN ( ∼ 20K steps) is about 3 times faster than DDQN ( ∼ 80K steps) to learn a policy that outperformed the RBC. The PPO agent has the slowest learning convergence than other DRL agents. Within 500 episodes, PPO can only approximate the RBC performance. The main reason is that PPO is an on-policy learning algorithm that does not use past samples and thus has a weaker sample efficiency, while the other DRL agents are off-policy learning algorithms that reuse a significant amount of past experience. The reward for each DRL algorithm except for PPO at the end of the 500 t h episode has converged to a stable value in all six runs. The final mean reward for each DRL controller can be used to quantify the expectation of such a controller applied to the system. The RBC yielded an episodic reward of −746.94. All MPC controllers outperformed the RBC by 18.47%\u201325.44%, and all DRL controllers outperformed RBC by 18.95%\u201325.65%. The best MPC rewards was −556.95 and achieved when H = 96 . The QRDQN and DDQN can give the best average reward, which is about 25% more than the RBC and almost equivalent to the best MPC. The SAC can be expected to be slightly worse than the best MPC, but PPO after 1500 episodes still under-performs the best MPC. The best episodic rewards for each control agent during the deployment period were also shown in Table 5. We used the best episodic reward to quantify the upper bound of the reward each controller can achieve. All DRL controllers except PPO can outperform the best perfect MPC given the computation budgets. QRDQN and DDQN exhibited the greatest upper bound, which is around −525 and outperformed the RBC and the best MPC roughly by 29.72% and 5.74% respectively. SAC achieved slightly worse rewards than QRDQN, but it still outperformed the RBC by 26.47%, and the best MPC by 1.38% respectively. The best reward PPO yielded is 20.29% more than the RBC, but 6.90% less compared with the best MPC. The major reason from control point of view is that PPO controller failed to learned a pre-cooling strategy, which is detailed in Section 4.7.3. To better quantify the approximation level of each controller to the \u201ctrue\u201d optimal solution (i.e., OPT), their reward differences from the OPT reward are normalized as a performance score as shown in Table 5. The larger the score is, the closer the suboptimal solutions are to the true optimality. The solution of OPT is considered the achievable optimality, and thus has a score of 100. The RBC has the worst control performance and leads to a score of 52.62. The best of DRL agents (i.e., QRDQN) can lead to a best score of 96.54, which means such a solution approximates the optimality by 96.54%, while the best MPC only achieves a score of 90.11. Except for PPO, all DRL agents with their best performance have a better approximation to the optimality than the best MPC, and are expected to have better approximation than the MPC with H = 32 . 4.7.2 Comparison of control performance The control performance of different agents during the testing week was summarized as in Table 6. The RBC leads to 57.37 k W h energy use, 7.16 $ energy cost and 2.00 K h total thermal discomfort. The relatively large thermal discomfort occurred at the beginning of the occupied period where a step change of zone air temperature setpoint was implemented. Due to the predictive capability and the relaxation of thermal comfort bounds, MPC can save energy cost by 17.60% and 27.37% compared with RBC but at the cost of greater total thermal discomfort. As the H increases, the MPC results in more energy consumption but less energy costs due to its capability of shifting on-peak load with a high energy price to off-peaks with a low energy price. With H = 96 , the MPC can shift the most amount of energy, and thus significantly reduces the energy bill. However, the MPC with H =96 lead to a maximum temperature violation out of the predefined upper bounds (e.g., 0.5 °C), which indicated that the solutions were not feasible and not optimal at that step. The percentage of infeasible steps in this case in terms of the whole simulation period is only 0.8%, and the infeasibilities mostly occurred at the end of the occupied period. For each DRL agent, the trained control policy that gives a reward closest to the final mean reward is chosen for the detailed control performance comparison. All DQN agents except PPO have learnt a load shifting strategy that leads to more energy consumption but less energy costs than the RBC. The best DRL agent, QRDQN, outperforms the best MPC slightly. Generally from Table 6, we can see that the more energy shifted from on-peaks to off-peaks the better reward an optimal controller can achieve. The detailed control policy that leads to the different load shifting strategies in each controller is discussed in Section 4.7.3. 4.7.3 Comparison of detailed control responses The detailed comparisons among different MPC controllers and DRL controllers are shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, respectively. Because RBC is not aware of the TOU energy price as shown in the top of Fig. 4, and the zone air temperature setpoint is set to 24 ℃ during occupied hours, the fan air flow varies with thermal load to maintain the room temperature. The \u201ctrue\u201d optimal solution denoted by OPT reveals a \u201cwide\u201d load shifting strategy. The \u201cwide\u201d strategy refers to the fact that the control action of load shifting spans a long duration. For example, in OPT, the fan is commanded on almost all nights to pre-cool the zone, while in MPC with H = 32 , the fan increases its speed only about 4 h ahead of the on-peak price increase. The \u201cwide\u201d load shifting strategy can shift the energy loads from day time to nights which may cross multiple energy price periods, while a \u201cnarrow\u201d strategy such as MPC with H = 32 can only shift the energy between adjacent price periods. The load shifting strategies for different MPC controllers are plotted in Fig. 4. The longer the prediction horizon is, the wider the load shifting strategy can be, which leads to better approximation of the optimality. With H is 16 or less, the MPC can barely provide load shifting capability as the fan speed does not respond to energy price changes. With H = 32 , the MPC can shift a small amount of energy with the highest price to a period with a medium price for a short time. With H = 96 , the MPC generates a \u201cwide\u201d load shifting strategy that is comparable with that by the OPT, and thus has the best control performance among other MPC controllers. With H = 48 , the amount of the shifted energy is in between of those by MPCs with H = 32 and H = 96 . Fig. 5 compares the learnt load shifting strategies by different DRL with RBC, the best MPC and OPT. PPO only respected thermal comfort bounds but did not respond to TOU energy price, and thus could not provide load shifting strategies. All other DRL agents can learn a \u201cwide\u201d load shifting strategy but with different magnitudes. SAC controller learnt a load shifting strategy that operates the fan and cooling coil at a low speed during off-peaks, which pre-cools the zone before it is occupied. However, the amplitude of the pre-cooling was relatively small, and thus the influences on the cost saving and thermal comfort were limited, compared with the best MPC. DDQN controller learnt a policy that shift a medium amount of energy from on-peak to off-peak periods. The DDQN controller could most time identify the two incidents when the energy price increases during a day, and pre-cools the room before the price increases. The QRDQN controller learnt a \u201cwide\u201d load shifting policy that is very close to OPT but have a similar reward as the best MPC. 5 Conclusions This research aims to compare the performance level of both model predictive control (MPC) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) control in building energy systems in terms of approximating the true optimality of an optimal control problem. To answer the question, this research presented a scalable containerized software framework for building control performance comparison, with a special focus on optimal control and learning-based control. With comprehensive numerical experiments, we find out both MPC and DRL controllers can learn load shifting strategies to utilize the passive thermal mass in a single zone building to respond to time-of-use energy prices. The best DRL agent can maximally approximate the true optimality by 96.54%, which outperforms the best MPC whose optimality level is 90.11%, but the same DRL agent is only expected (on average) to approximate the optimality by 90.42%, which is equivalent to the best MPC. For MPC with different prediction horizons, the longer the horizon is, the more similar the load shifting strategy is to the optimal load shifting strategy. For DRL agents, the controller QRDQN can approximate the optimal load shifting strategy to significant extent, which gives it the best control best performance over all compared controllers. All DRL agents except PPO can learn a better control policy, in terms of average reward, than the MPC with a prediction horizon of 32 steps. This research assumed perfect training and deployment processes for both MPC and DRL, which can shed insight on their possible maximum performance. However, this research also exposed a limitation, that is, the \u201cperfect\u201d MPC is not perfect. Although the models used in the MPC are perfect without modeling errors, the optimizer used in the MPC can be far from being perfect, because the resulting optimization problem is always nonlinear or even non-convex, and there lacks a \u201cglobal\u201d optimizer that can guarantee its optimality within given computation budgets. Without the guarantee of the optimality for each step in the MPC, the upper bounds for nonlinear MPC performance is difficult to evaluate. This will remain an open research topic for future investigations. The other future work will focus on the comparison of both controllers on a more realistic numerical environment. For example, MPC should use error-prone reduced-order models for its optimization, and DRL should consider non-episodic training and deployment process when no perfect environment model is available.

        "dc:description": "Both model predictive control (MPC) and deep reinforcement learning control (DRL) have been presented as a way to approximate the true optimality of a dynamic programming problem, and these two have shown significant operational cost saving potentials for building energy systems. However, there is still a lack of in-depth quantitative studies on their approximation levels to the true optimality, especially in the building energy domain. To fill in the gap, this paper provides a numerical framework that enables the evaluation of the optimality levels of different controllers for building energy systems. This framework is then used to comprehensively compare the optimal control performance of both MPC and DRL controllers with given computation budgets for a single zone fan coil unit system. Note the optimality is estimated based on a user-specific selection of trade-off weights among energy costs, thermal comfort and control slew rates. Compared with the best optimality we can find through expensive optimization simulations, the best DRL agent can maximally approximate the optimality by 96.54%, which outperforms the best MPC whose optimality level is 90.11%. However, due to the stochasticity, the DRL agent is only expected to approximate the optimality by 90.42%, which is almost equivalent to the best MPC. Except for Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), all DRL agents can have a better approximation to the optimality than the best MPC, and are expected to have better approximation than the MPC with a prediction horizon of 32 steps (15 min per step). In terms of reducing energy cost and thermal discomfort, MPC can outperform the rule-based control (RBC) by 18.47%\u201325.44%. DRL can be expected to outperform RBC by 18.95%\u201325.65% ,and the best DRL control policy can outperform RBC by 20.29%\u201329.72%. Although the comparison of the optimality level is performed in a perfect setting, e.g., MPC assumes perfect models, and DRL assumes a perfect offline training process and online deployment process, this can shed insight on their capabilities of approximating to the original dynamic programming problem.",
