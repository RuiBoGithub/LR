Model predictive control (MPC) is an effective method to optimally control the operation of air-conditioners. However, most existing MPC methods require the investment of additional equipment and labor-intensive work, which greatly increases the cost of MPC and hinders its practical application. To solve the problem, this paper presents an economical and practical MPC algorithm for DX A/C systems, capable of achieving a balance between thermal comfort and energy saving. The proposed algorithm was experimentally validated on both an experimental DX A/C system and a market available split-type air-conditioner. Experimental results on the experimental DX A/C system show that temperature and humidity set-points selected at α = 1 saved 23.3% of energy consumption compared to those selected at α = 0, while keeping indoor thermal comfort within acceptable range. And results on the split-type air-conditioner demonstrate energy savings of up to more than 32% compared to the baseline and proved that the algorithm can be practically applied on market available D/X air-conditioners.

Common residential air-conditioners, including split-type air-conditioners and variable refrigerant flow (VRF) systems, are DX A/C systems. The number of air-conditioners per 100 households in China reached 115.6 units in 2019, and it maintains a steady growth trend [1]. Correspondingly, the electricity consumption of residential air-conditioners has also grown rapidly, from 8.2 billion kWh in 2001 to over 100 billion kWh in 2019 in urban area. Residential air-conditioners account for about 20% of the total electricity consumption in urban residential building sector in China, and optimizing their energy consumption will be one of the priorities for the next phase of energy-saving work [2]. Theoretically, there are two technical routes to optimize the energy consumption of A/C systems. The first is to optimize the hardware, such as improving the performance of compressor or heat exchanger. By replacing single-speed compressor with variable-speed (VS) compressor, the cooling capacity can theoretically better match with the cooling load to avoid the energy loss caused by frequent on and off switching. However, to unleash the full potential of VS compressor, it requires the second route, i.e., improving the control algorithm. A control algorithm that can make the cooling capacity of an air-conditioner better match the cooling load under complex and changeable actual working conditions will reduce unnecessary losses caused by fluctuation. Further, the control objectives can also be optimized, appropriate adjustment of the control objectives can both meet the users\u2019 thermal comfort need and save energy. Compared with the first route, the second one has the following advantages: 1. No substantial changes to the structure of air-conditioners are required, 2. Energy saving can be achieved with limited additional investment, 3. Has the potential to involve residential air-conditioners in smart grid demand response (DR), and 4. Can build on the first route to achieve further energy optimization. On the other hand, China as a major air-conditioner manufacturing country, control algorithm is also the weak link and technical bottleneck of the Chinese air-conditioner industry [3]. The control objectives cannot be changed arbitrarily, as the changes will affect the thermal comfort level of occupants, the indoor cooling loads, the cooling capacity and energy performance of the A/C system at the same time. Model predictive control (MPC) is a promising approach to solve such multi-objective optimization problems [4]. MPC is a series of controls that employ models from some systems or processes for controlling the signal, minimizing an objective function [5]. When performing MPC in indoor thermal environment control, the models is required to accurately reflect the nonlinear thermal processes occurring in the conditioned space and the A/C system. However, especially for residential buildings, the practical application of MPC faces another challenge: economics. The economically viable realization of MPC in residential buildings requires an effort to minimize the need for additional equipment and labor-intensive modeling processes [6]. It would be highly significant for practical application if there is an MPC algorithm that could do the modeling and computing processes by the DX A/C system itself relying on its own sensors and its own extremely limited computational power controllers. 1.1 Literature review Specifically for the problem we are facing, there are generally two models that need to be built: a conditioned space thermal model (room thermal model or building model) and an air-conditioner model. In general, methods for modeling can be divided into 3 categories: white-box, black-box and grey-box [7]. White-box approach is purely physics based. It is a common technique for modeling A/C components and systems [8\u201310], and it is one of the most suitable candidates for predicting energy consumption and performance of controlled systems [11]. In terms of conditioned spaces, building simulation software like EnergyPlus [12\u201314] and eQUEST [15] are commonly used. White-box model can well describe the thermal dynamic characteristics of buildings and A/C systems, but the modeling process is usually complicated, and the solution process is computationally expensive and time consuming. White-box model usually requires targeted modeling, which means re-modeling has to be performed for different systems. Moreover, the uncertainty of the parameters usually leads to a degradation of accuracy and reliability [16]. On the contrary, black-box model is purely empirical based. It is data-driven, using historical data to establish purely mathematical relationships between inputs and outputs. Regression methods like artificial neural network (ANN) [17,18], multiple linear regression [19], support vector regression [20] are often employed. Black-box model is easy to develop and computationally efficient, but usually requires large amount of data for training. Furthermore, large prediction error may occur when operating condition exceeds the boundary of the training data. Air-conditioner model can be trained with sufficient data based on full operating experiments conducted by the manufacturer in the factory, and the same model can be used for the same type of air-conditioners in batch manufacturing. However, for conditioned spaces, it is very difficult to collect a sufficient amount and diversity of operating data to perform targeted modeling, as the individual characteristics of buildings are often very different. Grey-box model is considered to combine the advantages of both white-box and black-box. RC model is a widely used building grey-box modeling method. The modeling process for RC model focuses on determining the number of resistance and capacitance used and the circuit structure, and the methods for optimizing with historical data to obtain the appropriate resistance and capacitance values. Researchers used different numbers of resistance and capacitance and different structures of RC models depending on the issues of concern [7,21\u201324], more resistances and capacitances, and more complex structures often imply an increase in model accuracy, but the optimization process of model parameters requires a corresponding increase in computational power and data volume. Methods like trust region algorithm [23], genetic algorithm [25] and particle swarm optimization [26] are often applied. There is still no widely accepted method for determining the optimal structure of RC models, and the methods applied to optimize model parameters are still far too complicated considering the poor computational power of the controllers in DX A/C systems. In addition, these methods always require setting appropriate guesses in advance to obtain the global optimal solution, which is another obstacle for practical application. MPC can be performed after the models are built. Freund et al. [27] integrated a room thermal model and a heating system model into one RC model, based on which an MPC controller was developed and implemented in an office building for a three-month test. Field test reported 30% heating energy saving compared to the traditional rule-base controller (RBC). Hou et al. [28] developed an MPC controller for a university building with an RC building model integrated with a radiator system discrete-element model, considering weather forecast uncertainty. Simulation results showed that the proposed MPC controller could save 4.1% of weekly heating cost compared to RBC. Li et al. [29] developed a zone temperature MPC controller for a commercial building based on a linear state-space building thermal model and several steady-state multiple linear regression models for describing a variable air volume (VAV) system. Compared to baseline control, the MPC controller reported a 17.5% and an average of over 20% reduction in total electricity consumption in simulation and experimental results, respectively. Auto-regressive moving average exogenous models were proposed by Liang et al. to describe the indoor temperature variation of an office building and the variation of return air flow rate and energy consumption of its equipped VAV system. The optimal control based on the models reported over 27.8% energy saving on average as compared to the baseline [30]. An EnergyPlus-based MPC method was proposed by Ma et al. for a commercial building to reduce its energy consumption and cost by adjusting indoor temperature. 25.31% weekly energy saving, and 28.52% weekly cost saving could be achieved according to their simulation [31]. The models in these MPC methods often require professionals relying on prior knowledge for targeted modeling of specific systems, and the modeling and operation processes are computationally intensive, additional computing equipment such as personal computers (PC) are often required. While these additional investments in labor and equipment may be acceptable for the large buildings they studied, such as office buildings, commercial buildings, etc., a similar situation is not practical for small and medium-sized buildings using DX A/C systems, which themselves always cost only a few hundred US dollars to purchase. However, existing studies on the application of MPC on DX A/C systems do not pay sufficient attention to the economic sensitivity of the corresponding users, similar approaches to those employed in the large system studies are still used. A thermal comfort-driven control algorithm for residential split-type air-conditioners by adjusting temperature set-point was developed by Pandey et al. with an EnergyPlus-based state-space building model [12]. The experimental results showed that the algorithm reduced the energy consumption of the air-conditioner by about 5% compared to the base group with a bound control strategy. Mei et al. [32] proposed a hierarchical control method for a DX A/C system based on simplified physics based models. Simulation results showed that compared with the control method of fixed indoor set-points, the proposed method reduced the energy consumption by 31.38%. Hu et al. [33] developed a room RC model coupled with a simplified physics based air-conditioner model, and used genetic algorithm to solve the multi-objective optimization problem. Simulation results reported a maximum reduction of 37.51% in electricity costs. Although the above studies have achieved promising energy savings, the modeling and operation processes of these studies face the same problem of excessive computational load for DX A/C systems and the fact that most of the models are only applicable to the specific systems being studied. Efforts on model simplification have never stopped, for example, RC models and regression models can be regarded as simplified models describing building thermal characteristics. However, compared with the simplification efforts spent on building models, the simplification of air-conditioner models seems to be a bit crude in some studies using MPC for real-time indoor environment control. Assumptions such as the power/cooling capacity/coefficient of performance (COP) of the air-conditioner is a constant value [34\u201336], or a simple function of the outdoor temperature or indoor-outdoor temperature difference [23,37], or a simple function of the compressor frequency [38\u201340] are often employed. It is difficult to classify these models into the above three categories and they are over-simplified to reflect the air-conditioner performance and operation status accurately. 1.2 Problem description In general, the current studies on MPC when to be applied to DX A/C systems have several limitations as follows. 1. The models are either too complex to build and run on the controllers of DX A/C systems with extremely limited computational power, which would significantly increase the investment cost on additional computing equipment. Or they are too simple to accurately reflect the operation status. 2. The models of the air-conditioners and conditioned spaces are often specific to the particular systems under study and no generalized modeling approach is proposed for largescale applications, which means additional investment in targeted modeling is required. 3. The control objective of most studies is only the indoor temperature. A single temperature control not only does not serve well as a constraint for thermal comfort level, but also does not reflect the dehumidification effect that DX A/C systems have while cooling. Moreover, a single temperature control does not fully utilize the potential of DX A/C systems. Due to the above limitations, the authors have not yet seen an MPC method that is economical enough and general enough to be used in DX A/C systems. To bridge the research gaps, this paper aims to propose an economical and practical MPC algorithm for DX A/C systems, which could do the modeling and computing processes by the DX A/C system itself relying on its own controllers and sensors to minimize the need for additional equipment and labor-intensive modeling processes. The algorithm is capable of finding the optimal temperature and humidity set-points that balance thermal comfort and energy consumption. 1.3 Paper organization The rest of this paper is organized as follows: the development of the control algorithm is fully introduced in Section 2. Section 3 describes the experimental setups where the verification experiments were carried out, including an experimental DX A/C system and a market available split-type air-conditioner. Section 4 reports the experimental verification results. Uncertainties caused by some simplifying assumptions in cooling load prediction are discussed in Discussion, and methods to reduce such uncertainties are given. Finally, conclusion of this study is given in Section 6. 2 Development of the control algorithm 2.1 Outline of the proposed control algorithm A general description of execution process of the control algorithm is first introduced in this section for the ease of understanding. The proposed control algorithm as illustrated in Fig. 1 is hierarchical. The upper layer is used to determine the optimal temperature and humidity set-points, while the lower layer is responsible for controlling the indoor temperature and humidity to the set-points given by the upper layer. First of all, indoor temperature and humidity have to be stabilized successively on two sets of temperature and humidity combinations. For the consideration of minimizing the impact on the users\u2019 thermal comfort level, it is preferable for these two combinations to be in the range of PMV = [−0.5, 0.5], as we have carefully chosen them in the experiments on the experimental DX A/C system (Section 4.1). However, for simplifying the control process as well as for automatic operation, these two combinations can be determined without being specified, as we have done in the experiments on the market available split-type air-conditioner (Section 4.2). After the conditioned space has reached thermal equilibrium twice by some control algorithm, such as weights based fuzzy logic control algorithm (WBFLCA) [41] (for convenience, this process will be referred to as \u201cthe learning process\u201d later in this paper), the operational status of the DX A/C system in the two equilibrium, mainly the compressor speed ( S C ) and the supply fan speed ( S F ), are recorded separately. An artificial neural network (ANN) model (ANN1) is then used to identify the cooling capacities of the DX A/C system under the two different combinations of indoor temperature and humidity. As the cooling load is equal to the cooling capacity in stable state, the cooling loads of the room under the two different combinations are gotten. Then the two cooling loads and the corresponding temperature and humidity are used to obtain the relationship between indoor cooling load and indoor temperature and humidity, or so-called the indoor cooling load characteristics as shown in Fig. 1. After obtaining the characteristics, the indoor cooling loads under other temperature and humidity combinations can be calculated, which means the cooling capacities required for the room to be stabilized at other temperature and humidity combinations are obtained. Another ANN model (ANN2) is then used to calculate the operational statuses of the DX A/C system under candidate indoor temperature and humidity combinations that meet the thermal comfort requirement. The energy consumptions can be approximated by the operational statuses. Finally, a cost function is used to balance thermal comfort and energy consumption, determine the optimal temperature and humidity set-points and send them to the lower layer, where a WBFLCA-based PD-type fuzzy logic controller (PFC) is in charge of precisely controlling indoor temperature and humidity to their respective set-point. 2.2 Indoor cooling load analysis The control objectives of a DX A/C system are indoor air temperature and humidity, so this paper focuses only on the effect of indoor temperature and humidity changes on indoor cooling load. Some other time-varying disturbances are beyond the control and monitoring of a DX A/C system, and we will discuss the uncertainties caused by these factors and methods to reduce their impact in Discussion. The sensible cooling load of an air-conditioned room includes the following aspects: heat conducted through envelope, solar radiation through external windows, heat dissipation from human body, heat dissipation from lights, equipment, appliances, pipes and other internal heat sources, heat dissipation from food or other materials, and heat brought in by infiltrating air and fresh air. The main factors that are affected by changes in indoor temperature and humidity are heat conducted through envelope, and heat brought in by infiltrating air and fresh air. They can be calculated by equations (1) and (2), respectively. (1) Q s , w a l l = K ∙ A ( T o u t − T i n ) (2) Q s , a i r = ρ c p ( G inf + G n e w ) ( T o u t − T i n ) Where Q s , w a l l and Q s , a i r are the heat conducted through envelope and the heat brought in by infiltrating air and fresh air, respectively; K is the heat transfer coefficient of envelope; A is the area of envelope; T i n is indoor temperature and T o u t is outdoor temperature; G inf and G n e w are infiltrating air flow rate and fresh air flow rate, respectively; ρ represents air density and c p is the specific heat capacity of air. The latent cooling load of an air-conditioned space includes moisture dissipation from human body, moisture brought in by infiltrating air and fresh air, moisture from chemical reaction process, and moisture dissipation from wet surface, open liquid surface, liquid flow, food, material and equipment. The main factor that is affected by changes in indoor temperature and humidity is moisture brought in by infiltrating air and fresh air. It can be calculated by the following equation. (3) Q l , a i r = ρ ( G inf + G n e w ) ( d o u t − d i n ) r w Where Q l , a i r is the latent cooling load brought in by infiltrating air and fresh air; d o u t and d i n are the outdoor air humidity ratio and indoor air humidity ratio, respectively; r w is the latent heat of vaporization of water. Combining equations (1)\u2013(3), the cooling load related to indoor temperature and humidity can be obtained as shown in the following equations. (4) Q s , T = ( K ∙ A + ρ c p G inf + ρ c p G n e w ) ( T o u t − T i n ) (5) Q l , d = Q l , a i r = r w ( ρ G inf + ρ G n e w ) ( d o u t − d i n ) Where Q s , T is the sensible cooling load related to the temperature difference between indoor and outdoor, and Q l , d is the latent cooling load related to the humidity difference between indoor and outdoor. Let K Q s , T = K ∙ A + ρ c p G inf + ρ c p G n e w and K Q l , d = r w ( ρ G inf + ρ G n e w ) , for a specific air-conditioned room, K Q s , T and K Q l , d will change only when the envelope characteristic of the room changes significantly, and they can be regarded as constant. The total cooling load then can be calculated as follows. (6) Q s = K Q s , T ( T o u t − T i n ) + Q s 0 (7) Q l = K Q l , d ( d o u t − d i n ) + Q l 0 Where Q s 0 and Q l 0 are the cooling load that are not related to the difference between indoor and outdoor temperature and humidity. If we focus only on the variables that a DX A/C can handle, i.e., indoor temperature and humidity, then equations (6) and (7) can be rewrite as follows. (8) Q s = − K Q s , T T i n + Q s 0 \u2032 (9) Q l = − K Q l , d d i n + Q l 0 \u2032 Where Q s 0 \u2032 and Q l 0 \u2032 are the cooling load that are not directly related to the change of indoor temperature and humidity, which include factors like outdoor temperature and humidity, solar radiation, human body load, indoor equipment and devices load, etc. Among them, outdoor temperature and humidity, and solar radiation, or together called meteorological data, are the main time-varying factors. Air-conditioners that are not networked have difficulty getting timely meteorological information without the help of other equipment, so for the consideration of minimizing additional investment cost, we can further assume these meteorological data remain constant during the learning process, which is reasonable to some extent considering the short time consumed by the learning process. We will further discuss this assumption in Discussion. The indoor temperature and humidity in equations (8) and (9), i.e., T i n and d i n , can be measured by the temperature and humidity sensors installed in the indoor unit of a DX A/C system. If we can get two sets of cooling load values under two different indoor temperature and humidity combinations, then the remaining unknows in equations (8) and (9), i.e. K Q s , T , Q s 0 \u2032 , K Q l , d and Q l 0 \u2032 , can be solved to obtain the characteristics of the indoor cooling load with indoor temperature and humidity. 2.3 Cooling capacities identification and prediction The analysis in Section 2.2 is based on the fact that we can directly get the value of indoor temperature, humidity and cooling load, where temperature and humidity can be obtained from the temperature and humidity sensors, but cooling load is not directly available. As mentioned earlier, cooling load is equal to cooling capacity at thermal equilibrium, so cooling load can be obtained by identifying the cooling capacity of the air-conditioner to avoid the building modeling process. Xu et al. [42] found that the output total cooling capacity (TCC) and sensible heat ratio (SHR, the ratio between sensible cooling capacity and TCC) of a DX A/C system would vary with the compressor speed and supply fan speed, and each set of compressor speed and supply fan speed combination corresponded to a set of TCC and SHR combination, forming an approximate quadrilateral. A further study conducted by Li et al. found that the quadrilateral would vary significantly at different return air temperature and humidity [43]. On this basis, to identify the cooling capacity of the experimental DX A/C system, a 4-11-2 ANN model (ANN1) with return air dry-bulb temperature ( T d b ), return air wet-bulb temperature ( T w b ), compressor speed ( S C ) and supply fan speed ( S F ) as inputs, and sensible cooling capacity ( C C s ) and latent cooling capacity ( C C l ) as outputs is built as shown in Fig. 2 . After an ANN model is trained, it requires few computational power and calculates fast, making it well suited for application to the controllers in DX A/C systems. And the model training process of ANN is relatively simple, which is convenient to use for the manufacturers. A total of 180 sets of data are used to establish the ANN models of the experimental DX A/C system. The data were obtained by changing the compressor speed and the supply fan speed under 6 different groups of indoor air temperature and humidity condition as shown in Table 1 . Under each air condition, the compressor speed changes from 30% of the maximum speed to 80% at 10% intervals, and the supply fan speed changes from 30% to 70% of the maximum speed at 10% intervals, so there are 30 speed combinations as shown in Table 2 . The sensible cooling capacity and the latent cooling capacity can be calculated with the air temperature, humidity and flow rate before and after the evaporator. In practical application, the training data can be obtained by in-plant testing by the manufacturer. Since the same type of air-conditioner always goes into batch manufacturing, obtaining these data will not add much to the cost of production. A training program written in MATLAB with error back propagation algorithm (BP) is used to train the model. The 180 sets of data are randomly divided into 2 groups, one with 160 sets is used for training and the other with the remaining 20 sets is used for testing. The relative errors of sensible cooling capacity and latent cooling capacity identification of the test group are shown in Fig. 3 . The root mean square error (RMSE) of sensible cooling capacity identification is 1.32%, and that of latent cooling capacity identification is 1.62%. The comparison between the target value and predicted value of ANN1 for training data and testing data are presented in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 , respectively. The training result shows that we can get quite precise cooling capacity of the DX A/C system under different temperature and humidity with the ANN model (ANN1). By stabilizing the indoor temperature and humidity at two different combinations, we can determine the unknowns in equation (8) and equation (9), and then the indoor loads under other temperature and humidity combinations could be predicted. 2.4 DX A/C system operational status prediction The next step is to predict the operational status of the DX A/C system under different indoor temperature and humidity combinations. A cooling capacity identification ANN model (ANN1) has been developed in the previous section and shows good performance. Since cooling load is equal to cooling capacity at thermal equilibrium, an operational status prediction ANN model (ANN2) could be established by just swapping the position of the compressor speed and the supply fan speed in the input layer of ANN1 with the output layer, and the data used to train ANN2 can be the same as that used to train ANN1 without increasing the amount of data required. Fig. 6 shows the structure of the established 4-12-2 operational status prediction ANN model (ANN2). The inputs are indoor T d b and T w b , and the corresponding sensible and latent cooling capacity (cooling load) under the temperature and humidity combination. The outputs are the compressor speed and the supply fan speed that meet the cooling and dehumidification requirements under the temperature and humidity combination. It is worth noting that when simultaneously controlling indoor temperature and humidity, the range of cooling capacities that a DX A/C system could output is limited, and even more problematic is that the range will change significantly with the change of the return air state [43]. That means not all the temperature and humidity combinations that satisfy thermal comfort are controllable (corresponding cooling loads exceed the output range of cooling capacity). When a temperature and humidity combination is uncontrollable, the predicted compressor speed or supply fan speed will exceed their respective allowable speed ranges, and this combination will be excluded. The training process of ANN2 is similar to that of ANN1. The 180 sets of data mentioned above are randomly divided into two groups, 160 sets are used for training and the remaining 20 sets are used for testing. Fig. 7 shows the prediction error of the test group. The RMSE of the compressor speed prediction is 3.75% and that of the supply fan speed prediction is 2.83%. The comparison between the target value and predicted value of ANN2 for training data and testing data are presented in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9 , respectively. The main components that will change energy consumption in this algorithm are the compressor and the supply fan. The power of the compressor and the supply fan is calculated by linear interpolation based on the measured values in this paper for the experimental DX A/C system as shown in Table 3 . And the total energy consumption can be expressed as the sum of the compressor power and the supply fan power as shown in equation 10\u201312. Since the speeds predicted by ANN2 and the energy consumption calculated by linear interpolation are only for comparison, rather than the actual control target of the DX A/C system, the prediction accuracy of ANN2 and the estimation accuracy of linear interpolation are acceptable.Where P C and P F are the power of the compressor and the supply fan, respectively, in W a t t ; P t indicates the total power of the DX A/C system. The experimental DX A/C system used in this study is designed with large and long air ducts to accommodate the air-side sampling equipment, so it is equipped with a large supply fan whose power is not negligible compared to the compressor power, as shown in Table 3. However, for common DX A/C systems on market, such as split-type air-conditioners, the main energy-consuming component is the compressor. The power of the supply fan and the condenser fan is usually in tens of watts, while that of the compressor is usually in hundreds to thousands of watts. The power of the fans is generally 1\u20132 orders of magnitude smaller than that of the compressor, and the power of the condenser fan does not change much during operation. Therefore, in practice, the energy consumption under different indoor temperature and humidity combinations could even be compared directly using the compressor speed values to further reduce computational power requirements. 2.5 Cost function Finally, a cost function as equation (13) is applied to determine the final temperature and humidity set-points. (13) F ( T , H ) = α × P M V 2 + ( 1 − α ) P t \u203e 2 (14) P t \u203e = ( P t − P t , min ) / ( P t , max − P t , min ) Where PMV represents the Predicted Mean Vote, calculated by the computer program recommended by ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55 [44]. Except for temperature and humidity, metabolic rate is assumed to be 1.0 (Met Unites), clothing insulation is assumed to be 1.0 clo in Section 4.1 and 0.5 clo in Section 4.2, radiant temperature is set to be equal to indoor T d b , and air speed set to 0.1 m/s. In order to reduce the computational effort, the PMV values for different temperature and humidity combinations can also be determined using table look-up method. The value range of PMV is limited to [-0.5, 0.5] to avoid damage to thermal comfort; P t \u203e is the normalized total power and it is calculated by equation (14); P t , max indicates the calculated maximum power, while P t , min indicates the calculated minimum power. The first term of equation (13) measures thermal comfort and the second term measures energy consumption, an importance factor α , which takes a value in the range of [0, 1], determines the importance of the two. The temperature and humidity combination that minimizes F ( T , H ) is the final optimized temperature and humidity set-points. α could take a default value such as 0.5, it could also be determined by users. Or it could be determined by home energy management system (HEMS) based on the real-time electricity price. 2.6 Weights-based fuzzy logic control algorithm (WBFLCA) WBFLCA was firstly proposed by Xu et al. [41] to avoid the huge workload brought by setting fuzzy rules for a fuzzy matrix [45]. Li et al. [46] designed a WBFLCA-based PFC for a DX A/C system. Experiments showed good control performance with the controller. A same control idea is adopted in this paper, and the flow chat of the control process is shown in Fig. 10 . Both the supply fan controller and the compressor controller are based on WBFLCA, and the weights assigned for them are shown in Table 4 and Table 5 , respectively. 3 Experimental setups 3.1 The experimental DX A/C system The experimental DX A/C system mainly includes 3 parts: a DX refrigeration plant, an air distribution sub-system and a data acquisition and control system. The schematic diagram of the system is shown in Fig. 11 . Details of the refrigeration plant is shown in Fig. 12 . There is a variable speed rotary compressor, an electronic expansion valve (EEV), a thermal expansion valve (TEV), a tube-fin evaporator and an air-cooled tube-fin condenser. The rotational speed range of the compressor is 1000\u20137200 rpm, and the speed is limited to 30%∼80% of the maximum speed for protection purposes. The compressor power is monitored in real time by a single-phase digital power meter (Qingzhi ZW1603-S). Two kinds of expansion valve are installed parallel in the system, a TEV (Emerson BAE3.5ZW195) and an EEV (Danfoss ETS6-18). The TEV was used in the experiments, and the degree of superheat was set to 3.5 ° C . The evaporator is installed in the evaporator duct with a designed cooling capacity of 6 kW. A variable speed centrifugal fan (Yilida CB200D) with a maximum rotational speed of 3200 rpm is installed behind the evaporator as a supply fan, and its speed range is limited to 30%∼70% of the maximum speed for protection purposes. The supply fan power is monitored by a three-phase digital power meter (Qingzhi ZW3432B) in real time. The condenser is installed in the condenser box, and it is forced air-cooled by a DC variable speed fan (Yilida ZQ10-10). Electric heating tubes are installed at the entrance of the condenser box to control the inlet air temperature of the condenser. The air distribution sub-system consists of an air-conditioned space and air distribution ducts. The external size of the air-conditioned space is 4 m ( L ) × 2.6 m ( W ) × 2.7 m ( H ) and it is divided into 2 rooms (Room A and Room B) by a partition wall. During the verification experiments on the experimental DX A/C system, the inner door and window in the partition wall were kept open, when Room A and Room B could be considered as one single room. 2 load generation units (LGUs) are set in the air-conditioned space, each can generate up to 6 kW of sensible load and 4.5 kW of latent load. Return air of Room A and Room B emerge before entering the evaporator duct where the evaporator is installed. Air T d b and T w b measured before the evaporator are regarded as indoor air T d b and T w b . The experimental DX A/C system is equipped with high precision sensors and transducers to measure operating parameters including temperature, air and refrigerant flow rate, operating pressures in the DX refrigeration plant, etc. T d b and T w b of air before and after the evaporator, T d b of air before and after the condenser, and temperature of refrigerant are all measured by platinum resistance temperature devices (RTD) with a pre-calibrated accuracy of ± 0.1 ° C . The supply air flow rate is measured by the apparatus consists of diffusion baffles, nozzles and a differential pressure transducer with a measuring accuracy of ± 0.75 % of the full reading scale (ROSEMOUNT 3051S2CD), in accordance with ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 41.2. All the measurements are computerized, and all the measured parameters are processed and recorded by a data acquisition and control system. 3.2 A market available split-type air-conditioner A market available split-type air-conditioner was installed in the experimental DX A/C system described in Section 3.1 for testing, with the outdoor unit in Room A and the indoor unit in Room B as shown in Fig. 13 and Fig. 14 . During the verification experiments on the split-type air-conditioner, the inner door and window between Room A and Room B were kept closed, when Room A is used as the outdoor side and Room B as the indoor side, and at this time the experimental DX A/C system was responsible for maintaining the temperature of Room A at 35 ° C . Cooling load on the indoor side was provided by Room B LGU. The experimental data required to build the two ANN models was provided by the manufacturer based on the factory test data. The temperature and humidity on the indoor side (Room B) was controlled by the split-type air-conditioner, which also monitored the indoor air temperature and humidity, compressor speed and supply fan speed with its own sensors. Since the controller of the air-conditioner itself contains many programs that are not related to the algorithm proposed in this paper, such as the program for compressor overheating protection, it is hard and pointless for us to write the proposed algorithm directly into the controller and debug it in our laboratory. Alternatively, the air-conditioner transmits the data monitored by its own sensors to a PC via RS 485, the proposed algorithm written in LabVIEW on the PC then calculates the compressor speed and the supply fan speed and sends them back to realize the control of the air-conditioner. After returning the air-conditioner to the manufacturer, the technicians in the factory have written the proposed algorithm into the air-conditioner's own controller and reported successful reproduction of our experimental results, proving that the algorithm can run directly based on the air-conditioner's own controller and sensors without the need for any other additional hardware investment cost. 4 Experimental results In this section, two different sets of experiments were performed on the two experimental setups. Experiments on the experimental DX A/C system were conducted to validate the performance of the proposed MPC algorithm under the same cooling load but different α values, while experiments on the split-type air-conditioner were to validate the performance of the algorithm under the same α value but six different cooling loads and demonstrate that the algorithm can be practically applied on market available D/X air-conditioners. 4.1 Results on the experimental DX A/C system The LGUs were programmed to increase the sensible load by 160 W when the indoor air temperature dropped by 1 ° C and increase the latent load by 120 W when the indoor air humidity ratio dropped by 0.001 k g / k g d a to simulate the change of cooling load with the change of indoor temperature and humidity. The base sensible load was set to 2650 W at indoor air temperature of 25 ° C and the base latent load was set to 1300 W at indoor air humidity ratio of 0.01 k g / k g d a (corresponding T w b was 18.1 ° C ). The initial indoor air temperature was 28 ° C and the initial RH was 70% ( T w b = 23.7 ° C ), and the control algorithm started to execute at 300 s. The inlet air temperature of the condenser was controlled at 30 ° C during the experiments and the condensing air flow rate was maintained at 2100 m 3 / h . First, the indoor temperature and humidity needed to be stabilized at two different combinations, i.e., the learning process. The first combination was 25 ° C / 50 % ( T w b = 18.0 ° C ). The indoor state could be considered stable at 5340 s, and the control target was changed to the second combination: 23 ° C / 50 % ( T w b = 16.5 ° C ). The PMV corresponding to the two combinations were 0.5 and 0, respectively, so most of the time, the thermal comfort could be satisfied. The change of indoor temperature and humidity during this process and the corresponding changes in the compressor speed and the supply fan speed is shown in Fig. 15 . By inputting the steady-state indoor air temperature and humidity, the compressor speed and the supply fan speed into ANN1, the cooling capacities under the two temperature and humidity combinations, which was also the cooling loads, could be obtained. Equations (15) and (16) are the obtained indoor cooling load characteristics according to the two temperature and humidity combinations and their corresponding cooling loads. (15) Q s = − 168.89 T i n + 7023.1 (16) Q l = − 110488 d i n + 2218.3 Then the candidate temperature and humidity combinations were substituted into equations (15) and (16) to calculate the corresponding cooling loads. The selection range of indoor temperature was [ 22 ° C , 28 ° C ] , and that of indoor relative humidity was [ 30 % , 70 % ] . Besides, a candidate should also satisfy that the calculated PMV was within [ − 0.5 , 0.5 ] . In order to save computational power, the relative humidity was taken every 5% from 30% to 70%, and the PMV was taken every 0.1 from −0.5 to 0.5. The compressor speed and the supply fan speed that were required to control the indoor air to a candidate temperature and humidity combination could be predicted by inputting the candidate and the corresponding cooling load into ANN2. During this process, the temperature and humidity combination whose predicted compressor speed or supply fan speed was beyond the controllable range was marked as uncontrollable. Due to space limitations, Table 6 shows the speed prediction results of 15 sets randomly selected from all candidates. The energy consumption of the compressor and the fan were obtained by linear interpolation from their respective predicted speeds. Then the energy consumption value was normalized and substituted with the corresponding PMV value into the cost function (equation (13)) to calculate F ( T , H ) , the temperature and humidity that minimized F ( T , H ) was regarded as the final optimized temperature and humidity set-points. Table 7 shows the optimized set-points and the operational status of the DX A/C system under different α values. The actual values are the measured values after the indoor temperature and humidity have stabilized at their set-points, so they may be slightly different from the predicted values. It can be seen from the table that as the value of α increased, the PMV gradually approached 0, and the total energy consumption gradually increased. The total energy consumption when α = 0 was 23.3% less than that when α = 1 , while the thermal comfort was still acceptable. 4.2 Results on the split-type air-conditioner We have tested the performance of the proposed algorithm on the split-type air-conditioner under six different loads as shown in Fig. 16 . The red quadrilateral in Fig. 16 is the output range of cooling capacity of the air-conditioner at an indoor temperature and humidity of 26 ° C /50% and an outdoor temperature of 35 ° C , as plotted from factory test data. The diamond points in the figure represent the six loads at 26 ° C /50%, three of them are within the air-conditioner's cooling capacity output range and three are outside the range. For each load, the LGU was set to increase the sensible load by 120 W for every 1 ° C drop in T d b and increase the latent load by 90 W for every 0.001 k g / k g d a drop in humidity ratio. In order to reduce the requirement for computational power, the PMV values for the experiments on the split-type air-conditioner were taken by the look-up table method, specifically, the PMV values corresponding to different temperature and humidity combinations were calculated in advance and then made into a matrix together, and the PMV values required for the operation of the algorithm were obtained by retrieving the matrix. Unlike the previous experiments conducted on the experimental DX A/C system, the clothing insulation is taken as 0.5 clo for this section, so the indoor environment of this part is slightly warmer than that in Section 4.1. The control target was first set directly to 26 ° C /50% (PMV = −0.03), and the air-conditioner tried to control the indoor temperature and humidity to the set-points with a WBFLCA-based PFC. The power of the air-conditioner was recorded after the temperature and humidity were stabilized as the baseline power for comparison. The control performance under the six loads is shown in Fig. 17 . Since loads No.4, No.5 and No.6 are located outside the output range of the air-conditioner, it is impossible for the air-conditioner to stabilize indoor temperature and humidity at the set-points under these loads, as shown in Fig. 17. As the load gradually moves away from the output range, the temperature and humidity become more and more unable to stabilize at the set-points. Therefore, the power corresponding to these loads take their average power during the fluctuation phases. Next, the complete control process of the proposed algorithm was applied to all the six loads, setting α = 0 uniformly. The complete control processes for loads No.3 and No.6, which respectively represent loads within and outside the output range of the air-conditioner, are shown, including the learning process (Stage 1 and Stage 2) and the process of temperature and humidity stabilization at the optimized target set-points (Stage 3), as illustrated in Fig. 18 . For non-expert users, it is difficult to specify two appropriate temperature and humidity combinations in the learning process, especially considering that not all combinations are controllable. On the other hand, the learning process actually has no special requirements for the two temperature and humidity combinations, as long as they can be stabilized. Therefore, the final stabilized temperature and humidity of Stage 1 and Stage 2 in Fig. 18 were not specified, but stabilized by a \u201cdichotomous method\u201d. The general idea of the \u201cdichotomous method\u201d is quite simple: we first fix the compressor speed and the supply fan speed at the average of their respective maximum and minimum speeds (i.e., the middle speeds) and observe the change in room temperature and humidity. If the room temperature drops after a period of time, for example, the middle speed of the supply fan of the previous period is used as the new maximum speed of the next period, and a new middle speed is calculated based the new maximum speed and the minimum speed; if the room temperature rises, the opposite happens, the middle speed of the supply fan of the previous period is used as the new minimum speed of the next period. The compressor speed control is similar. The process is continuously cycled until the indoor temperature and humidity are stabilized. The power of the air-conditioner and the indoor thermal comfort level with the proposed algorithm compared to the baseline are shown in Fig. 19 . As can be seen, the proposed algorithm achieves a maximum energy saving of more than 32% while ensuing thermal comfort compared to the baseline experiments. In addition, as indoor temperature and humidity change, both load and air-conditioner's output range change [43]. Therefore, the proposed algorithm can move the load that originally falls outside the air-conditioner's output range into the range, making the \u201cuncontrollable\u201d load \u201ccontrollable\u201d, as demonstrated by the comparison of the control performance of load No.6 in Figs. 17 and 18. 5 Discussion Considering the limitations of the data monitoring capability and computational power of DX A/C systems, a series of assumptions to exclude some time-varying disturbances are made in Section 2.2. The uncertainties caused by these factors and methods to reduce their impact require further discussion. In equations (8) and (9) of Section 2.2, we consider the sensible cooling load as a primary function of indoor temperature, the latent cooling load as a primary function of indoor humidity ratio, while all the other factors that are beyond the control and monitoring of a DX A/C system are included in Q s 0 \u2032 and Q l 0 \u2032 , and they are considered to be constant to reduce the modeling difficulty and the requirement of computational power. However, Q s 0 \u2032 and Q l 0 \u2032 are actually constantly changing throughout a day. The main time-varying factors are outdoor temperature, outdoor humidity, and solar radiation. So, equations (8) and (9) can be rewritten as follows. (17) Q s = − K Q s , T T i n + K Q s , T T o u t + Q s o l a r + Q s 0 \u2033 (18) Q l = − K Q l , d d i n + K Q l , d d o u t + Q l 0 \u2033 Where Q s 0 \u2033 and Q l 0 \u2033 are the cooling load that are considered not to vary with time. Q s o l a r represents cooling load from solar radiation, and it can be calculated as the following equation. (19) Q s o l a r = S H G C ∙ A w i n I s o l a r Where SHGC represents solar heat gain coefficient; A w i n is the area of external window; I s o l a r represents global solar radiation. Thus equation (17) can be rewritten as follows. (20) Q s = − K Q s , T T i n + K Q s , T T o u t + S H G C ∙ A w i n I s o l a r + Q s 0 \u2033 For a specific air-conditioned room, SHGC and A w i n can be regarded as basically unchanged, so S H G C ∙ A w i n can be regarded as one unknown variable. If T o u t , d o u t , and I s o l a r can be obtained through additional sensors or Internet of Things (IoT), then equation (20) contains three unknowns, while equation (18) contains two. Thus, all the unknowns can be solved by stabilizing the indoor temperature and humidity at three different combinations. In other words, if more data, such as meteorological data, are available, the uncertainties can be reduced, which does not affect the methodology of the proposed algorithm. However, obtaining these additional data requires additional investment cost, which would be a hindrance to practical application. In this regard, to reduce uncertainties, Q s 0 \u2032 and Q l 0 \u2032 in equations (8) and (9) can be updated every time when the indoor thermal environment reaches thermal equilibrium during the subsequent control process, which means that each thermal steady state can form a new learning process with the previous steady state. That will reduce cooling load calculation uncertainties caused by the assumptions and will not further increase the requirement of computational power and investment cost. 6 Conclusion This paper proposes a new MPC algorithm for DX A/C systems for practical application, with a particular focus on the economic aspect. The algorithm can automatically find the optimal temperature and humidity set-points that balance thermal comfort and energy saving. The control algorithm is hierarchical, with the upper layer giving the target temperature and humidity set-points and the lower layer responsible for controlling the room temperature and humidity at the targets. First, a generalized method for identifying indoor cooling load characteristics is proposed. By stabilizing the indoor temperature and humidity at two different combinations, the cooling load characteristics are obtained. In this process, a static ANN model for predicting the cooling capacity of DX A/C system is used to obtain the cooling load under steady state, which reduces the difficulty of cooling load calculation. Then, the candidate temperature and humidity combinations and their corresponding calculated cooling loads are inputted into another ANN model to obtain the compressor speed and the supply fan speed required to stabilize the indoor thermal state at the candidates. After excluding the uncontrollable candidates, a cost function is used to balance thermal comfort and energy consumption. The cost function has an importance factor α to determine the relative importance of thermal comfort and energy consumption. The temperature and humidity combination that minimizes the result of the cost function is the final selected temperature and humidity set-points. Finally, the target temperature and humidity set-points are passed to the lower layer, where a WBFLCA-based PFC is responsible for controlling indoor temperature and humidity at the set-points. The algorithm was experimentally verified on both an experimental DX A/C system and a market available split-type air-conditioner. Experiments with different α settings were carried out on the experimental DX A/C system. The PMV when α = 0 was 0.5, and the PMV when α = 1 was 0. In contrast, the energy consumption of the DX A/C system when α = 0 was 23.3% less than that when α = 1 . As the α value decreased, the selected temperature and humidity set-points became more and more energy-efficient, and as the α value increased, the selected temperature and humidity set-points became more and more comfortable. Experiments conducted on the market available split-type air-conditioner verified the control performance of the algorithm under different loads with the same α setting. The results showed that the algorithm achieves energy savings of up to more than 32% compared to the baseline. It also proves that the algorithm can be practically applied on market available DX air-conditioners Moreover, if electricity price information or other grid signals are introduced to automatically determine the α value, the further development of the proposed algorithm has the potential to involve residential air-conditioners in demand response, while ensuring the thermal comfort of occupants. Further research is needed in this area.

        "dc:description": "The large ownership of direct-expansion (DX) air-conditioning (A/C) systems in small and medium-sized buildings brings with it the need to reduce their energy consumption without damaging the thermal comfort of the occupants. Model predictive control (MPC) is an effective method to optimally control the operation of air-conditioners. However, most existing MPC methods require the investment of additional equipment and labor-intensive work, which greatly increases the cost of MPC and hinders its practical application. To solve the problem, this paper presents an economical and practical MPC algorithm for DX A/C systems, capable of achieving a balance between thermal comfort and energy saving. The proposed algorithm was experimentally validated on both an experimental DX A/C system and a market available split-type air-conditioner. Experimental results on the experimental DX A/C system show that temperature and humidity set-points selected at α = 1 saved 23.3% of energy consumption compared to those selected at α = 0, while keeping indoor thermal comfort within acceptable range. And results on the split-type air-conditioner demonstrate energy savings of up to more than 32% compared to the baseline and proved that the algorithm can be practically applied on market available D/X air-conditioners.",
