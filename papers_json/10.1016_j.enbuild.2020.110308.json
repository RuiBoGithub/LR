Control sequences for air distribution and terminal systems in heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) aim to achieve a balance in the system outputs, i.e., maintain thermal comfort and indoor air quality (IAQ) with minimal energy use. ASHRAE Guideline 36 (G36) \u2013 High-Performance Sequences of Operation for HVAC Systems, is the result of ASHRAE research project 1455-RP intended to develop standardized sequences of operation to achieve more effective use of existing controls. This paper complements G36 by evaluating the influence of the uncertainty inherent in the control components (e.g. sensors and actuators) on the system outputs of a multiple zone variable air volume (VAV) system. The system outputs under study were zone air temperature, relative humidity, carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration, and site electricity use. To evaluate the effects of uncertainty in HVAC systems with advanced sequences of operation, this work applies a Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis to a detailed Modelica building energy model that has been programmed with G36 control sequences. Uncertainty models were integrated with the deterministic models of the building and the control sequence at small time scales to represent frequencies in which a real-world building automation system (BAS) samples its signals. The impact of uncertainty was quantified using annual simulations. Specification of the accuracy levels in the components of the control system were evaluated by the means of: 1) uncertainty analysis for low, medium, and high severities of accuracy in the components to identify relation between performance requirements and component accuracy, and 2) sensitivity analysis to identify the sensors and actuators where the impact of uncertainty on the system outputs is most influential. Keywords ASHRAE guideline 36 Control sequences Modelica buildings library Monte Carlo Multiple zone VAV Sensitivity analysis Uncertainty analysis 1 Introduction The U.S. Department of Energy has commissioned studies [1\u20133] to estimate potential national energy savings in commercial buildings as a result of detecting, diagnosing, and correcting operational problems with building systems and their controls; estimate market penetration of energy saving approaches using controls and diagnostics; and analyze barriers impeding more effective use of building controls. Fernandez et al. [3] estimated the potential national site energy savings to be 29% in an analysis of 51% of the floor space of the commercial buildings stock. Thus, much attention is being given to the development of technologies and control strategies that maximize the operational energy performance, improve indoor air quality (IAQ), and enable fault detection and diagnostics in buildings. As an example, ASHRAE (formerly the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air-Conditioning Engineers) has recently published the first version of Guideline 36 (G36) \u2013 High-Performance Sequences of Operation for HVAC Systems, which describes standardized sequences of operation for common HVAC systems [4]. The first version of G36 published \u201cbest of class\u201d proven practice that was initiated for air distribution and terminal systems in ASHRAE research project 1455-RP [5]. Control sequence performance may suffer from various uncertainties [6]. Several studies have emphasized the need to understand the impact of uncertainty on the control sequence applied since conclusions on performance using deterministic analysis could be hindered when evaluating the associated uncertainties [6\u20139]. Wang et al. [9] performed an uncertainty analysis for a model-based optimal control in comparison with three conventional control sequences and found the optimal control, though associated with impressive energy savings, to be the least robust in handling uncertainty. G36 includes sequences of operation for improving energy efficiency, improving indoor air quality, maintaining thermal comfort, detecting faults in system operation, and maintaining stable operation of system equipment. Performance evaluation of G36 sequences has been directed mainly at achieving widespread implementation. Accordingly, G36 intends to incorporate functional performance test (FPT) scripts in its future addenda that verify conformance to the sequences at every installation [4]. To compensate for the short duration of a FPT, a trend analysis would evaluate control performance over a longer period of time. In addition to the control sequences performance evaluation in place and for the control sequences to achieve their intended multi-domain objectives effectively, it is also important to evaluate G36 performance in handling uncertainty in order to identify accuracy requirements for the control components. Furthermore, because \u201ccost-effective\u201d components in HVAC systems may yield considerable uncertainty in the control performance [10], identifying the components (e.g. sensors and actuators) where the impact of uncertainty on the system outputs is most influential is important to inform specification of the accuracy levels in the components of the control system. G36 functionality is intended to expand to cover more system types, for example, sequences for central plants and hydronic systems, which are the subject of an ongoing research project [11]. G36 also intends to incorporate in its future addenda the sequences from the completed ASHRAE research project RP-1747 on CO2-based demand controlled ventilation (DCV) [12]. O\u2019Neill et al. [13] recently tested RP-1747 sequences for energy and ventilation performance and found the sequences to achieve good compliance with the ventilation requirements in ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 62.1. Indoor air quality results from the combined effect of a large number of chemical, physical, and biological contaminant exposures, many of which are costly and difficult to measure. Consequently, it is common for indoor air quality to be controlled by prescriptive ventilation with outside air based on knowledge of typical contaminant sources and occupant response to odor as in, for example, ASHRAE Standard 62.1 [14]. While the status of carbon dioxide (CO2) as an air contaminant at typical indoor levels is a subject of some dispute, it is common to use CO2 as an indicator of air quality because of its relationship to ventilation rate. In this role, it indicates the degree of dilution of indoor CO2 generation by occupants. CO2 concentration frequently is used to control ventilation flow rate dynamically [14]. G36 provides guidance for CO2 set-point in indoor air to be used in DCV and monitoring/alarming routines [4]. Thus, in this study we used CO2 concentration to represent IAQ. To quantify the impact of uncertainty in the control components on energy use and indoor environmental quality, this work implements Monte Carlo annual simulations to a virtual model developed with the equation-based Modelica language. The building thermal model with detailed implementation of G36 sequences of operation were integrated with uncertainty models at small time-scales to simulate realistic performance of advanced control sequences in handling uncertainty. 1.1 Related works Advancements in building energy modeling tools and low-cost computing have made simulation-based uncertainty quantification more tractable, and have enabled more thorough exploration of uncertainty in building energy analysis. Here we focus on summarizing works that employ sampling-based approaches with detailed forward models. For a broader and more exhaustive review that also surveys various methods and approaches, the reader is referred to the work of Tian et al. [15]. Pang et al. [16] also conducted an updated review on the application of SA for building performance with the majority of the reviewed case studies limited to the works after 2012. The review covered SA methods used to rank the input parameters or identify the dominant parameters; methods used to sample and add uncertainties to the input parameters; the selection of simulation software and SA tools; and analysis of the input\u2013output connection that shows the case studies selection of input parameters for different research purposes. Burhenne et al. applied a Monte Carlo (MC) uncertainty analysis (UA) approach to a simple building thermal model with a solar thermal collector [17]. The models were implemented in the equation-based Modelica language, and the uncertainty in the fraction of total heating energy that could be provided by the solar collector was quantified. The framework was later extended to include uncertainty in cost-benefit calculations in [18]. Hopfe and Hensen applied MC UA to evaluate the impact of uncertainty in construction parameters and internal gains on annual energy use and thermal comfort of a simulated office building [19]. The influence of uncertainty in weather and operational parameters on annual building site energy was investigated by Wang et al. using a MC UA approach with EnergyPlus [20]. HVAC operational parameters were found to be the most influential and introduced −15.3% to 70.3% variation in annual site energy consumption. Additionally, Sun et al. present an UA framework for considering the impact of microclimate variables in [21]. A detailed investigation of sensitivity and uncertainty in fenestration and glazing parameters was performed by Singh et al. [22]. Performance impact was quantified in terms of useful daylight illuminance, lighting energy consumption, and HVAC energy consumption. Eisenhower et al. also utilized a sampling-based approach, and showed how sensitivity analysis (SA) and uncertainty analysis can inform the development of meta-models for design optimization and model calibration [23 24]. The impacts of energy model simplifications and uncertainty were investigated by Silva and Ghisi [25]. Fifteen EnergyPlus models were created for the same building that varied in the level of external geometry simplification, the level of detail in the internal zones, and the modeling approach to internal thermal mass. Results were compared in terms of heating and cooling energy and simulation computational time. Pang and O\u2019Neill performed SA and UA on the domestic hot water (DHW) system of a large hotel using EnergyPlus [26]. A MC approach was used to perturb time-independent model parameters, while Karhunen-Loève expansion was used to include uncertainty in time-varying schedules. The uncertainty was quantified for DHW-associated output variables, such as peak and annual water consumption and peak and annual gas consumption of the water heaters. SA results prompted several recommendations for improving the design and operation of DHW systems. Li and O\u2019Neill [27] ranked critical faults in HVAC systems through a Sobol-based SA in terms of the building energy consumptions and occupant thermal comfort using EnergyPlus. The fault analysis framework was tested on a medium office building in different climate zones with multiple faults simulated concurrently with considerations of fault occurrence probability distributions. Scheduling faults such as the HVAC system not switching off outside the time range of the occupied period ranked the highest for all climate zones. Excluding the scheduling faults, the SA identified different critical faults among the climate zones, which demonstrated sensitivity to weather impacts. Sun et al. included MC UA within a framework for optimally sizing HVAC, wind generation, and solar photovoltaic generation systems for net zero energy buildings [28]. Uncertainty in building parameters lead to variation in the peak cooling and heating loads that must be met through design of the energy systems. The optimal design problem considered a multi-criteria objective function that included initial cost, thermal comfort, and grid stress scores. Uncertainty analysis has also been applied to the design and operation of distributed energy systems for building districts. Mavromatidis et al. used EnergyPlus within a MC framework to model the stochastic energy demands of an urban neighborhood [29]. The variable energy profiles were used as inputs to a mixed-integer linear program that simultaneously solves for the optimal design and operation of the distributed energy system for each sample. Optimization results were visualized to illustrate the variation in optimal design, total system cost, and carbon emissions that results from the considered uncertainties. The results were primarily targeted at decision support for system design. The design of district cooling plants considering uncertainty and reliability was also considered by Gang et al. [30]. UA has also been incorporated with commercial building rating systems to more accurately represent the scoring for a particular site, depending on the quality of information provided [31]. Most of the works highlighted thus far have focused on the utilization of uncertainty analysis to quantify variation in aggregate metrics to inform decision making and building design. However, a few additional studies more narrowly focused on UA as related to control systems and strategies. In the updated review on the application of SA for building performance, Pang et al. [16] implemented an analysis of the associations among SA input parameters in the reviewed case studies and found most correlated inputs related to building envelope and occupant behavior, while case studies rarely investigated control strategy inputs. A Sankey plot for the input\u2013output connection have shown most of the already small number of studies that investigated control strategy inputs focused on energy use system outputs with few studies investigating thermal comfort and IAQ. For example, Liao et al. applied uncertainty analysis more directly to HVAC control systems and strategies in [6]. The impact of uncertainty in four different sequences that staged chillers according to an indicator of the building cooling load was analyzed using a TRNSYS model. Performance was quantified by calculating the energy use of the plant, supply air temperature tracking error, and the number of times a chiller is switched on or off. Performance degradation (e.g. increased energy use, increased switching, high supply air temperatures) was observed to be substantial for several cases. The analysis was also extended to evaluate control strategy selection and robustness in [32]. In a similar application, Shan et al. propagated measurement error associated with HVAC sensors through near-optimal and optimal control strategies to quantify the dispersion in plant power and annual energy consumption [8]. TRNSYS was used within a MC framework to produce the uncertainty estimates. In [7], a similar MC sensitivity and uncertainty analysis was applied to quantify the impact of CO2 and air flow measurement error on outdoor air flow setpoints and return air CO2 concentrations for three demand-controlled ventilation strategies. Zone CO2 concentration balances were programmed in Matlab for multiple individual zones, and were validated using measured building data. Yan et al. quantified the uncertainty in outdoor air controls for a variable air volume (VAV) air handling unit with supply fan and return fan [33]. After quantifying uncertain parameters, EnergyPlus was used to calculate the energy impact of the uncertainties in terms of heating and cooling energy. It was found that considering uncertainty in outdoor air controls resulted in 17% difference in cooling consumption and 43% difference in heating consumption, compared to the standard approach that models the controls as a constant deterministic outdoor air ratio. The potential impact on economizer fault detection routines was also noted. To quantify the difference between optimal control sequences and conventional control sequences in handling uncertainty, Wang et al [9] used Matlab to quantify the impact of uncertainty in the sensors and actuators on energy use for a cooling plant integrated with lake water in a data center. Although several recent works provided insight into the impact of uncertainty in HVAC control systems, no studies were found to leverage a building and control system model with integrating uncertainty models at small time-scales with detailed sequences of operation. Considering the interplay between local loop controllers, sequences of operation, and interacting system physics it is important to accurately quantify and propagate uncertainty through the system. Interacting local loop proportional integral (PI) controllers may serve to attenuate or exacerbate the influence of uncertainty, and it is difficult to predict a priori which outcome will result for a given set of system parameters. Furthermore, as mentioned in [33], the propagation of uncertainty may have important implications for the configuration and effectiveness of fault detection routines. 1.2 Objectives In this work we developed a building energy model with a detailed implementation for the control sequence of operation described by G36 integrated with uncertainty models at small time scales. The control system featured eleven fully tuned local loop PI controllers. We developed the virtual model using the equation-based Modelica language for its ability to simulate complex physical systems, and applied Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the impact of uncertainty on annual performance for system outputs of thermal comfort, represented by zone air temperature and relative humidity (RH); indoor air quality (IAQ), represented by carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration; and energy use. In the virtual model we used modules from the open-source Modelica Buildings Library (MBL) that supports defining new modules by means of modifying existing models [34]. In addition, we used modules from the Modelica Standard Library (MSL) [35], such as the modules used for simulating the stochastic effects. The primary contributions of this paper are to quantify the effect of different levels of uncertainty on performance and investigate how uncertainty can be incorporated in the specification and selection of components. 2 Building thermal model To develop a representative, yet highly interpretable, test case, a two-zone model was developed using technical specifications collected from a real-world typical medium office building located in State College, PA. The numbering of the zones in the real-world application (i.e. zone 406 and zone 222) was used to refer to the thermal zones used in this study. The technical specifications of the thermal zones used for this study are shown in Table 1 . The building thermal load was calculated for conductive heat transfer through the building envelope and heat gains from solar, occupants, equipment, and lighting. The radiant time series (RTS) method was used instead of the more computationally intensive heat balance (HB) method. The heat gains were not added instantaneously to the zone air, instead the effect of the construction thermal mass along with the furniture was simulated in the virtual model. Solar heat gain that passes through clear double-pane vertical windows was calculated using the window heat gain tool [36]. These simplifications were adopted since it has been shown to provide acceptable accuracy, at reduced computational burden. Considering the intended application in this study to quantify uncertainty at small time scales through realistic control sequences, reducing computational burden is a necessity. Sensible and latent heat gains from occupants were added to the zones and varied over the span of the day according to the occupancy schedule. Heat gain from equipment and lighting were also added to the zones according to a schedule that was on during the occupied operation mode and off otherwise. Moisture generation and CO2 emissions by occupants were also added to the zone air and varied according to the occupancy schedule. The thermal zones were positively pressurized. The reader is referred to Appendix A for further details of the MBL implementation of the building thermal model. 3 HVAC system modeling A multiple zone variable air volume (VAV) system with hot water (HW) heating coil, chilled water (CHW) cooling coil, draw-through variable speed fan, and terminal units with hot water reheat coils was used to provide heating and cooling to the thermal zones. The word \u201ccomponent\u201d throughout this paper refers to the sensors and actuators of the control system. The modeled VAV system includes temperature sensors, airflow measurement, differential pressure transducers, air damper actuators, water valves, and variable frequency drive (VFD). A schematic representing the system model, including physical devices, sensors, and actuators, is provided in Fig. 1 . Detailed duct pressure losses were calculated for a duct design that satisfied equal pressure loss in the supply and return sections. The minimum outdoor air intake flow set-point was calculated with a dynamic reset based on system ventilation efficiency according to ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 62.1\u20132013 [37]. The system under study had a common economizer and minimum outdoor air damper and return air damper that were sized according to ASHRAE Guideline 16\u20132018 [38]. Finally, the fan total static pressure combined with a safety factor at design flow was calculated and the fan performance curves were obtained from manufacturer data sheets. The fan power consumption was dynamically calculated according to the airflow-electric power performance curve. To transfer sensible and latent cooling energy and heating energy used at the coils to site electricity use the study applied conversion factors from [39]. Environmental measurements were combined with assumptions about clothing and activity level to predict occupant\u2019s thermal satisfaction through calculations of the predicted mean vote (PMV) and predicted percentage of dissatisfaction (PPD) according to Fanger\u2019s model [40]. According to ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55\u20132017 (S55) [41] analytical comfort zone method, comfort zone is defined as conditions falling within and including PMV levels between −0.5 to + 0.5, or PPD level below 20% when accounting for local discomfort. The reader is referred to Appendix A for further details of the MBL implementation of the HVAC system model. 4 Sequences of operation An adjusted version of the MBL implementation for G36 control sequences was used in this study. This section discusses the main strategies implemented in the control sequences of operation. 4.1 Zone group operating modes The VAV system served two thermal zones that formed one zone group. Occupied, cool-down/warm-up (optimal start), setup/setback, and unoccupied operation modes were employed. The occupied mode was engaged during weekdays from 7 AM to 7 PM. During night setback, the time outside the range in the occupied mode, setup/setback was engaged when both zones exceeded the unoccupied set-point. The system remained in setup/setback modes until both zones maintained the unoccupied set-point. Cool-down/warm-up modes engaged thirty minutes before the start of the scheduled occupied period (7 AM) when zone air temperature was above/below occupied set-points. The system would be in the unoccupied mode (switched off) whenever the zone group was not in any other operation mode. Fig. 2 shows an example of the system engaging and disengaging different operating modes to satisfy the thermal zones heating loads. The event of zone air temperature exceeding the unoccupied set-point is shown in Fig. 2.a with an orange dot on trajectories T406 and T222. The event of zone air temperature maintaining the unoccupied set-point is shown in Fig. 2.a with a magenta dot on trajectories T406 and T222. In time periods A and B in Fig. 2.a, two orange dots can be observed (two zones exceeded unoccupied set-point), accordingly, setback mode was engaged in both time periods as shown in Fig. 2.c. By comparing the number of the magenta dots between time period A and time period B in Fig. 2.a, one magenta dot can be observed in time period A (one zone maintained unoccupied set-point) compared to two magenta points in time period B (two zones maintained unoccupied set-point). Accordingly, in time period A the system did not disengage setback mode compared to time period B where the system disengaged the setback mode and engaged unoccupied mode as shown in Fig. 2.c. 4.2 VAV terminal unit with reheat The control system for the test case of the two-zone model used eight PI control loops to maintain zone air temperature, terminal unit discharge air temperature, and terminal unit airflow. The terminal unit was controlled by two zone air temperature control loops (heating and cooling), which reset the airflow set-point and the discharge air temperature (DAT) set-point. Dual maximum terminal unit airflow set-points were used with the cooling airflow set-point being higher than the heating airflow set-point. The control sequence aimed at saving energy at the terminal unit when the zone was in the heating state by ensuring the zone load was satisfied by resetting the terminal DAT set-point first before resetting the airflow set-point. Having the terminal DAT set-point reset to its maximum and the zone heating load not yet satisfied, the airflow set-point would then modulate between minimum and maximum heating airflows. On the other hand, the zone cooling load was satisfied by resetting the airflow set-point between minimum and maximum cooling airflows first before issuing cooling requests to reset the air handling unit (AHU) supply air temperature (SAT) set-point. Trim and Respond (T&R) strategies aim to optimize a set-point for pressure or temperature at the AHU in order to efficiently satisfy the load in the thermal zones. T&R strategies reduce the set-point at a fixed rate, until a downstream zone is no longer satisfied and generates a request [4]. Cooling requests were issued by the terminal unit controller to reset the AHU SAT using T&R strategies. 4.3 Multiple zone VAV air handling unit The control system for the AHU used three PI control loops to maintain supply air temperature, duct static pressure, and minimum outdoor airflow (MinOA). The speed of the supply fan was controlled based on duct static pressure and a fixed pressure set-point was used in place of the G36 T&R strategy. The AHU SAT control loop sequences the heating coil, outdoor air damper, return air damper, and cooling coil. The economizer dampers, outdoor and return dampers, were controlled by the SAT control loop to achieve mechanical cooling savings. The MinOA loop interconnects with the AHU SAT control loop by resetting the minimum outdoor air damper position (MinOA-P) and maximum return air damper position to maintain IAQ. A fixed dry bulb air economizer high limit lockout was implemented when the outdoor air temperature exceeded the return air temperature (RAT). The economizer lock out also interconnects with the AHU SAT control loop by resetting the maximum outdoor air damper position to MinOA-P to prevent introduction of outdoor air in excess of the MinOA set-point at a time the AHU SAT loop is in cooling state. The economizer was disabled in all operation modes except the occupied mode to simplify the system dynamics associated with its operation in the virtual model. This simplification has shown acceptable accuracy especially that it only affected energy savings since maintaining IAQ was only required during the occupied mode. The reader is referred to Appendix A for further details of the MBL implementation of the control sequences of operation. 5 Uncertainty quantification Uncertainty was simulated with a statistical distribution established on the basis of testing large numbers of a component (e.g. sensor and actuator) [42]. Error is the difference between the measured value and the true value for each measurement. The distribution is described by: 1) the systematic error or bias which is characterized by being fixed from measurement to measurement, and 2) the random error or precision which is defined as the difference between any individual measured value and the mean from the many measurements. The virtual models developed in the MBL generate deterministic values. Uncertainty is inherent in the sensors and actuators that are used in an HVAC control system. In order to simulate the stochastic nature of the real system a Monte Carlo sampling approach was used, which includes random input variables, rather than deterministic for the components under study [43]. It was assumed that no bias error existed in the components since biases are always taken as a component fault [6]. 5.1 Modeling uncertainty of sensors and actuators and propagation of the stochastic signal Fig. 3 illustrates the impact of uncertainty on a system output. Three independent studies were implemented to quantify uncertainty that resulted from low, medium, and high accuracy level components as shown in Fig. 3.a. If the system output of interest is zone air temperature, the physical value represents the actual temperature of the air, which can be measured with a deterministic (zero-uncertainty) sensor as shown in Sensorsphysical in Fig. 3.b. The measured value includes the stochastic effect of a real-world temperature sensor. In the modeled system, the measured value was obtained by adding a stochastic signal to the physical zone air temperature as shown in Sensorsmeasured in Fig. 3.b. The measured temperature was used in the control sequence instead of the physical temperature, accordingly, the sensor stochastic effect was propagated through the control system. Next, the control sequence calculates the actuator signals to satisfy the load in the thermal zones as shown in Actuatorscalculated in Fig. 3.b. The actuator positioning (e.g. air damper actuator) includes the stochastic effect of a real-world actuation system. In the modeled system, the actuator positioning value is obtained by adding a stochastic signal to the calculated actuator signals as shown in Actuatorspositioning in Fig. 3.b. Since stochastic signals are used in the control sequence and the actuation system, the zone air physical temperature deviates from what it would have been if the components were modeled without uncertainty. This deviation represents the propagated uncertainty value. The statistical distribution of the propagated uncertainty values shown in Fig. 3.c is established by implementing a Monte Carlo method for a large number of independent simulations each with a differently computed stochastic signal. Fig. 3.d shows the propagated uncertainty statistical limits on the measured value of a local control loop. By comparing the uncertainty region of low and high component accuracy levels in Fig. 3.d, the set-point is observed to be outside the uncertainty region of high accuracy (i.e. measured value is known with sufficient accuracy to conclude that the controlled variable is different from the set-point), while the set-point is observed to be within the uncertainty region of low accuracy (i.e. measured value is not known with sufficient accuracy to conclude that the controlled variable has deviated from the set-point). 5.2 Different levels of uncertainty for the sensors and actuators The uncertainties in the nineteen components illustrated earlier in Fig. 1 were modeled in the virtual model. In the UA, uncertainty of all components was simulated simultaneously with one accuracy level (e.g. medium accuracy)\u2014uncertainty was quantified for three severities of accuracy in three independent studies. In the SA, one component at a time was simulated with uncertainty in order to isolate its impact. Only the uncertainty that resulted from medium accuracy level components was quantified in nineteen independent studies\u2014each of the components in a separate study. The deterministic simulation represented the ground truth against which the UA and SA studies were compared. The deterministic simulation was fully-tuned by manually adjusting the PI controller parameters for all the control loops, one loop at a time. The low accuracy level was defined by data from manufacturer\u2019s least accurate product lines and the required reporting accuracy for trending data in ASHRAE Guideline 13 [44]. Standard commercial-grade components were defined as medium accuracy to represent standard practice in building thermal comfort applications. Industrial-grade components that may be required in some applications in the process industry and might not be cost-effective in building control systems were used for high accuracy. The characteristics of the three accuracy level components are summarized in table 2 . Table 3 shows the virtual model inputs and outputs to quantify the uncertainty that resulted from medium accuracy level components. Perturbation in the outputs was the result of simulating the sensors and actuators with stochastic effects. To quantify the uncertainty that resulted from low/high accuracy level components, the low/high accuracy values listed in Table 2 was used in place of the 95% confidence interval of the random error (±2σ) values listed in Table 3. 5.3 Uncertainty quantification framework Fig. 4 shows the overall uncertainty quantification framework. The virtual model approximates a real-world implementation of a control system by introduction of uncertainty to its components (e.g. sensors and actuators). Uncertainty in the components was simulated by adding a stochastic signal to the component deterministic value. The stochastic signal was randomly sampled from a normal distribution characterized by a bias (represented by the mean) and a random error (represented by the standard deviation) as shown in the components statistical distribution in Fig. 4. The sampling period of the stochastic signal was set equal to 30 s in order to represent the sampling period in which a real-world BAS samples its signals. One hundred Monte Carlo simulations each with a randomly computed stochastic signal were implemented, hereinafter called the simulation batch. The annual simulation outputs were resampled every five seconds. At each time step, the statistical bootstrap percentile technique was used to draw 1000 samples from the results of the Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the median value and the bounds of the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the statistics under study (e.g. mean and standard deviation) [59]. 6 Results and discussion 6.1 Uncertainty propagation to system outputs Fig. 5 illustrates the impact of the component uncertainty on zone air temperature, zone air relative humidity, CO2 concentration, PMV level, and PPD level\u2014quantified using annual simulations. The grid of subplots presents the system output in the columns and the estimated statistic, mean and standard deviation, in the rows. The mean values represent the deviation from the deterministic values, accordingly, a mean value of zero corresponds to the stochastic simulation not showing deviation from the deterministic simulation. All operating modes other than \u201coccupied\u201d were filtered out from the annual simulation outputs, resulting in 2,253,935 time steps. At each time step, the Monte Carlo simulations resulted in a perturbation in the system output (e.g. zone air temperature), and the bootstrap estimated the mean and standard deviation of the perturbation. The bootstrap estimates from all the time steps in the annual simulation had a distribution that describes the annual range of impact on the system output, which was represented in the kernel density estimation curves in the subplots. For example, the curve for zone 406 air temperature in the top row of the subplots was implemented using 2,253,935 estimates for the mean of the perturbation (one mean value for each time step). The median and the 95% CI percentile values illustrated on the density estimation curves in Fig. 5 are shown in Table 4 and Table 5 . Fig. 5 shows the kernel density estimation of the underlying distribution of system outputs across three severities of accuracy in the components such that those distributions can be compared. By comparing the range of the 95% CI for the distributions, the distributions for low accuracy components is observed to have a relatively large range of the 95% CI, while the distributions for higher component accuracy levels is observed to have a relatively small range of the 95% CI. If the height of the distributions, along the y-axis, were scaled in order for the distributions to have the same area, the height of the distributions for the higher component accuracy levels would have been much larger than the height of the distributions for the low component accuracy level, which would have prevented easy comparison between the three severities of accuracy. Thus, the height of the distributions were scaled by the number of observations in that bin. 6.1.1 Result 1: Relation between performance and components accuracy Reduction in component accuracy level from high to medium had an insignificant influence on the system outputs, while the influence was significant between medium and low accuracy. Fig. 5 illustrates this finding. For example, the range of the 95% CI of the means estimate (the top row of subplots) for zone 406 air temperature illustrates: the range increase in response to a degradation in accuracy level high to medium is small in comparison to a degradation in accuracy level medium to low. The absolute decreases were high to medium (0.1 °C) and medium to low (0.76 °C). This difference in influence associated with the change in accuracy level justifies an investment in medium accuracy level components in comparison to low, but does not justify an investment in high accuracy level in comparison to medium. 6.1.2 Result 2: Small improvement in thermal comfort and IAQ associated with a decrease in accuracy level Contrary to what might be expected, by comparing the distribution statistics for the three severities of accuracy shown in the first row of subplots in Fig. 5 a small improvement in thermal comfort and IAQ as a result of a decrease in components accuracy level can be observed in both zones. For example, consider the median of means associated with a decrease in accuracy level medium to low: The median for PPD in both zones decreased in response to a degradation in accuracy level. The absolute decreases were 0.97% for PPD406 and 0.55% for PPD222\u2014a decrease in PPD indicates an improvement in the thermal comfort. The median for CO2 concentration in both zones decreased in response to a degradation in accuracy level. The absolute decreases were 2.1 ppm for CO2,406 and 5.08 ppm for PPD222 (a decrease in CO2 suggests an improvement in IAQ as it is indicative of increased ventilation rate). 6.1.3 Result 3: Propagated uncertainty using the pooled results from the Monte Carlo simulations In this work we quantified the uncertainty propagated into the system outputs (e.g. zone air temperature) in response to the uncertainty in the components. This provided a tool to judge whether the source of a control problem is poor performance or simply the result of uncertainty in the components. For example, for the zone air temperature to fall within the propagated uncertainty limits means not enough evidence exist to judge whether the deviation from the deterministic simulation was caused by poor control performance or was simply the result of uncertainty in the components. As discussed in section 6.1, the bootstrap estimates for the mean and the standard deviation quantified the propagated uncertainty in the system outputs at each time step in the annual simulation. The bootstrap estimate values are variable for different operating conditions or time steps, which is shown in the distributions in Fig. 5. For low accuracy components in zone 406 air temperature for example, the 2.5 percentile, median, and 97.5 percentile for the distribution for the mean estimates are −0.30, 0.15, and 0.63 °C. This describes the distribution of the mean estimates for all the time steps in the annual simulation. Although comparing the system output (e.g. zone air temperature) to a variable propagated uncertainty\u2014tailored to system operating conditions\u2014can further the accuracy of performance assessment, it can be challenging to apply in real-world applications because it introduces an additional step which is to predict the propagated uncertainty value from the system operating conditions. Accordingly, the pooled system output that resulted from all Monte Carlo annual simulations was used to provide an estimate of the propagated uncertainty that is fixed for the range of operating conditions of a typical year. At each time step, the 100 Monte Carlo simulations yielded 100 values that collectively describe a perturbation in a system output such as air temperature. For all the time steps, the pool of the results from the Monte Carlo simulations had a statistical distribution as illustrated in Fig. 6 . This distribution represents the propagated uncertainty for the annual range of operating conditions and was implemented using 225,393,500 data points (100 MC simulations with 2,253,935 time steps per simulation). The median and the 95% CI percentile values illustrated on the density estimation curves in Fig. 6 are listed in Table 6 . For example, the propagated uncertainty for the low accuracy components for zone 406 air temperature described using the 2.5 percentile, median, and 97.5 percentile were −0.33, 0.15, and 0.68 °C. Although uncertainty simulated in the components did not include bias, the propagated uncertainty has a 0.15 °C bias (median). This means that uncertainty in the components resulted in an increase in the zone air temperature compared to the deterministic simulation on average. Similar to the distributions shown earlier in Fig. 5, the distributions in Fig. 6 were not scaled to have the same area, instead the height of the distributions were scaled by the number of observations in that bin. The pooled method only provides a distribution after pooling all the time steps, thus, it results in a fixed propagated uncertainty for the range of the time steps considered \u2013 one year in this study, while the bootstrap method provides propagated uncertainty estimates for each time step\u20145 s in this study. In addition to providing an estimate for each time step, the bootstrap method provides an estimate of the propagated uncertainty that is fixed for the range of time steps considered, similar to the pooled method. This is shown in the strong agreement between the pooled percentile values and the percentile values for the distribution of the annual bootstrap estimates of the mean illustrated in the top row of subplots in Fig. 5 and listed in Table 4. The fixed propagated uncertainty was simpler to quantify using the pooled method because it did not include the extra bootstrap estimation. But it was not easy to construct the statistical distributions shown in Fig. 6 because the number of data points used in the pooled method was 100x larger than the bootstrap method. Furthermore, the pooled method estimate of the propagated uncertainty represented the ground truth because it was quantified using a very large number of data points of actual deviations from the deterministic system outputs. The strong agreement between the pooled percentiles and the bootstrap percentiles of the mean estimate suggests that among the bootstrap estimates at every time step, the mean estimate of the system output perturbation represents the propagated uncertainty value not the standard deviation estimate. The standard commercial-grade components (i.e. medium accuracy) used in this study resulted in acceptable control, shown in the relatively small 95% CI for the zone conditions in Fig. 6. For example, the 95% CI for the deviation from the deterministic PPD for zone 406 is (-0.87%, 0.57%), which is relatively small considering the PPD compliance to be 20% according to S55. This illustrates a relatively small impact on thermal comfort. As for the IAQ, the 95% CI for the deviation from the deterministic CO2 concentration for zone 406 is (-5.13 ppm, 4.95 ppm), which is also relatively small considering the CO2 setpoint guidance in G36 to be around a 1000 ppm. 6.1.4 Result 4: Energy use Unlike quantification of uncertainty in thermal comfort and IAQ system outputs illustrated in Fig. 5, uncertainty quantification for site electricity use was not implemented every time step. Instead, the 100 Monte Carlo simulations resulted in perturbation in the cumulative annual site electricity use (100 values for the entirety of the annual simulations), the bootstrap percentile technique was used to evaluate the mean and the standard deviation of annual energy metric. Fig. 7 illustrates the influence of uncertainty on annual site electricity use\u2014evaluated without excluding any of the modes of operation. The deviation from site electricity use in the deterministic simulation is listed in association with a 2σ estimate in Table 7 , where σ is the bootstrap estimate of the standard deviation of the perturbation. Uncertainty in the components increased total annual site electricity use as low accuracy177.44 kWh (4.24%) ± 3.37 kWh for low accuracy, medium accuracy 23.35 kWh (0.56%) ± 2.26 kWh for medium accuracy, and high accuracy10.25 kWh (0.25%) ± 2.83 kWh for high accuracy. The relatively small 2σ estimate indicates strong agreement on the total annual site electricity use of the Monte Carlo simulations (small dispersion). Although the degradation in accuracy level resulted in a small improvement in thermal comfort and IAQ as discussed with regard to result 2, the degradation in accuracy level resulted in an increase in site electricity use as expected. Similar to the observation discussed in result 1, a decrease in component accuracy level high to medium had an insignificant influence on electricity use while the influence was significant with medium to low accuracy decrease. This emphasizes the same conclusion that the influence on total site electricity use associated with the change in accuracy level justifies an investment in medium accuracy level components in comparison to low, but does not justify an investment in high accuracy level in comparison to medium. 6.2 Effect of uncertainty on PMV-based thermal comfort assessment Fig. 8 and Fig. 9 show the difference in influence, on the PMV-based thermal comfort, associated with the change in accuracy level of the components, quantified using annual simulations. In both figures, the grid of subplots presents the accuracy level in the columns and the thermal zones in the rows. The outputs from the simulations were resampled every fifteen minutes and all but occupied periods were filtered out, which resulted in 12,528 time steps in each simulation. For each of the thermal zones, the colored data points or curves, in Fig. 8 or Fig. 9, represent the results from the deterministic simulation and are identical across all the accuracy levels. The greyscale data points or curves represent the results from the stochastic simulations, 100 Monte Carlo simulations plotted on top of each other in every subplot. In Fig. 8, the thermal comfort assessment was implemented using the percentage of PMV data points that are out-of-compliance (i.e. system output). The black data points represent a randomly selected simulation out of the 100 MC simulations that has been highlighted to emphasize the dynamics associated with the stochastic simulations. For each of the compliance thresholds (i.e. PMV ≤ -0.5 and + 0.5 ≤ PMV) in every subplot of Fig. 8, there is 100 PMV out-of-compliance percentage values. The bootstrap percentile technique was used to estimate the mean and the standard deviation of the out-of-compliance values as shown in Table 8 . 6.2.1 Result 5: Improvement in thermal comfort associated with a decrease in component accuracy level Similar to the observation discussed in result 2, the percentage of data points that are out-of-compliance listed in table 8 and shown in Fig. 10 demonstrated an improvement in the thermal comfort of both zones as a result of degradation in the components accuracy level. Though the improvement discussed in result 2 appeared to be small because it was represented by a small improvement in PPD. Fig. 10 illustrates that the improvement in PMV out-of-compliance percentage values was insignificant when associated with a degradation in the components accuracy level high to medium, while the improvement was significant with a medium to low accuracy degradation. For example, a decrease in accuracy level in thermal zone 406 reduced the percentage of slightly cool out-of-compliance (i.e. PMV ≤ -0.5) as follows: high to medium (4.2%) and medium to low (37.9%). Fig. 10 also shows relatively small 2σ estimate \u2013 shown by the small error bars, which indicates strong agreement on the PMV out-of-compliance percentage values of the Monte Carlo simulations (small dispersion). This improvement in thermal comfort is also shown in the difference in dynamics between the stochastic simulations (represented in the black data points) and the deterministic simulation (colored data points) in Fig. 8. The data points from the stochastic simulation appear to disperse around the deterministic data points with a tendency to move towards the comfort zone rather than away from it, this is more illustrated in the low accuracy subplots. 6.2.2 Result 6: Potential explanation to improvement in thermal comfort and degradation in energy use associated with accuracy level decrease In the low accuracy components in Fig. 9, by comparing the greyscale density estimation curves (PMV for Monte Carlo simulations) and the colored curves (PMV for deterministic simulation) a decrease in the density of data points at the compliance thresholds can be observed. The decrease was associated with an increase in the density of data points within the comfort zone indicating an improvement in thermal comfort. Similar to the results shown above, the influence associated with medium and high accuracy was insignificant. Although degradation in accuracy level improves thermal comfort, the improvement was associated with an increase in site electricity use as expected. This could be attributed to the low accuracy components activating the zone air heating and cooling when the temperature is actually still in the comfort zone, which might both limit excursions outside of it and require more energy use. For example, a zone air temperature PI loop in a deterministic system with zero set-point tracking error would have the heating/cooling appropriately provided to satisfy the load. An introduction of a low accuracy zone air temperature sensor to the system would introduce deviation in the measured temperature normally distributed around the set-point. If the measured temperature result in a set-point tracking error the following chain of events will take place; 1) the heating/cooling provided will increase to meet a false load, false because the actual zone air temperature is at set-point and the set-point tracking error is the result of measurement uncertainty, 2) the actual zone air temperature\u2014that was at set-point in the deterministic system\u2014will move into the comfort zone, resulting in better thermal comfort, and 3) the increased heating/cooling will increase the energy use. In the virtual model under study the control loops were fully tuned and the system set-points were maintained satisfactorily. The influence of uncertainty was expected to cancel out because components were simulated with normally distributed stochastic signals. But, the improved thermal comfort and increased energy use indicated the PI control loops calculating more aggressively with lesser accuracy levels, a matter that could be attributed to the integral term in the loop. This explanation provides an insight into the influence of uncertainty that needs to be investigated with future research. The improvement in zone conditions and degradation in energy use associated with accuracy level decrease shown in this study suggests: 1) the cost savings that would be achieved in specifying low accuracy components would also be associated with wasting energy as high as 4.24% increase in total site electricity use compared to the deterministic simulation as shown in Tables 7 and2) energy wasted because of low accuracy components is expected to go unnoticed especially that space condition requirements were achieved and even improved from the deterministic simulation. Future research can investigate cost-benefit analysis to evaluate the relationship between the cost of the wasted energy and the cost savings associated with specification of component accuracy. 6.3 Sensitivity analysis Nineteen independent annual SA studies were performed, each with only the component under study simulated with uncertainty. The SA studies were evaluated for the combination of accuracies of medium accuracy components in Table 2. Five system outputs were used to evaluate the impact of uncertainty; total annual site electricity use; thermal comfort represented in PPD value for both zones; and IAQ represented in CO2 concentration for both zones. The methodology applied in the UA to quantify the propagated uncertainty was also used in the SA studies. Uncertainty was quantified using one hundred Monte Carlo simulations and the bootstrap method\u20141000 bootstrap samples were drawn at each time step. The components (e.g. sensors and actuators) were ranked in descending order of their impact on the system outputs. The measure used to rank the components for the PPD and CO2 system outputs were the estimated range of the 95% CI for the uncertainty distribution, as an example, the range between the 2.5 percentile and the 97.5 percentile shown in the top row of subplots in Fig. 5. The measure used to rank the components for total site electricity use was the estimated deviation from the deterministic value, as an example, the mean estimates shown in Table 7. The component with the highest impact has a value of the rank equal to 1 while the rank of the component with the least impact is 19. Accordingly, each of the components had five independent rankings, one for each system output. The five rankings were averaged with an equal weight, which in turn served as the measure to show the difference between components in effecting an impact on the combination of system outputs. Fig. 11 shows the components ranked according to their impact on the combination of system outputs (left-to-right), while the trajectory line illustrates the components rank according to their impact on each of the system outputs independently, the ranking values are shown in table 9 . The sensitivity value of the component with the highest impact\u2014on each of the system outputs independently\u2014was assigned a 100 value so that rest of components were compared to it, accordingly, showing the difference between components clearly. For example in row two, the 38% sensitivity value for T222 means the impact of T222 on the deviation from the deterministic electricity use was 38% the impact of SAT. The negative sensitivity values shown in the electricity use column means the component impacted a decrease from the deterministic electricity use, i.e., improved electricity use performance in comparison to the deterministic simulation. 6.3.1 Result 7: Difference between components (e.g. Sensors and actuators) in effecting an impact on the system outputs Fig. 11 illustrates strong agreement between the rank according to the combination of system outputs and the rank according to each of the system outputs independently. The temperature sensors\u2014SAT, zone air temperature in both zones, DAT222, OAT, DAT406, respectively\u2014had the highest impact on the combination of system outputs (energy use and zone conditions), followed by the airflow measurement at the terminal units and the AHU HWV. The dampers and hot water reheat valves in the terminal units appear to have a lower impact. In this study a fixed duct static pressure set-point was used in place of the G36 T&R strategy, this is expected to have influenced the VFD and pressure transducer low ranks. Future research can evaluate the impact of the duct static pressure T&R strategy on the components rank. 7 Computing time Twenty two simulation batches, a total of 2,200 simulations, were performed, three for the purpose of UA and nineteen for SA. One simulation was implemented in the deterministic case. Each of the simulations was implemented on the Pennsylvania State University Institute for CyberScience Advanced CyberInfrastructure (ICS-ACI) using a 2.2 GHz Intel Xeon single processor. The simulation result files and the post-processing result files with a total size of 8.73 terabyte (TB) were stored on ICS-ACI. Post-processing was implemented in Python programming language and used multiprocessing. The average post-processing time was 21.8 [hr/sim. batch] when utilizing 6 processors. Table 10 presents the simulation statistics, from which the following can be observed: First, a decrease in accuracy level from medium to low was associated with an increase in computing time (16.5%), number of state events (254.7%), number of chattering instances (525.8%), and percentage of simulation crashes (298.2%). On the other hand, a decrease in accuracy level from high to medium had a negligible impact on the simulation statistics. Second, all UA and SA studies have approximately equal numbers of time events. This indicates that the number of time events is not influenced by accuracy level or the number of components simulated with uncertainty (e.g. 19 components in the UA versus 1 component in each SA study). Instead the number of time events is attributed to the 30 s sampling period used in the stochastic signal. The chattering instances reported in the simulations were overcome relatively quickly. The calculations in Table 11 approximate the cumulative computing time for the UA and SA studies. 8 Discussion and conclusions In this study, a virtual model using MBL for a multiple zone VAV system controlled with a detailed implementation of G36 sequences served as a testbed for evaluating the performance in thermal comfort, IAQ, and energy use. Uncertainty was quantified using Monte Carlo simulations and the bootstrap method for long durations (e.g. typical year), and the impact of different severities of accuracy on performance was quantified to investigate how uncertainty can be incorporated in the specification and selection of components. Sensitivity analysis was also implemented to identify the sensors and actuators uncertainty that produce the greatest degradation in performance. The following represents a summary of the findings: \u2022 Building control systems with standard commercial-grade accuracy (i.e. medium accuracy) components resulted in acceptable control. \u2022 Reduction in the accuracy level for the sensors and actuators of the building control system from industrial-grade accuracy (i.e. high accuracy) to standard commercial-grade accuracy (i.e. medium accuracy) had an insignificant influence on system performance, while the influence was significant for reduction in the accuracy level from medium accuracy components to manufacturer\u2019s least accurate product lines (i.e. low accuracy). This provides further evidence to the appropriateness of the standard practice that high accuracy components which may be required in some applications in the process industry might not be cost-effective in building control systems. \u2022 Manufacturer\u2019s lowest accuracy product lines were shown to improve zone conditions but also to increase energy use which suggests the cost savings that would be achieved in specifying component accuracy might be outweighed by wasted energy, which could go unnoticed due to the lack of degradation in environmental control. \u2022 Uncertainty in the temperature sensors, SAT and zone air temperature in both zones, produced the greatest degradation in control system performance, while AHU economizer dampers and terminals HWV had small influence on performance. Contrary to what might be expected, fan loop components also had small influence on performance which is expected to have been influenced by implementing a fixed duct static pressure set-point. This shows that the uncertainty propagated into the system performance is the effect of the specific sequences that were applied. \u2022 The bootstrap method provided an estimate of the propagated uncertainty for each time step that is variable for different operating conditions. The bootstrap method also provided an acceptable accuracy in quantifying the propagated uncertainty that is fixed for the range of operating conditions of a typical year. This was validated by the pooled method estimate of the propagated uncertainty. In this study we developed a representative, yet highly interpretable, test case of a two-zone model with eleven control loops and still introduced simplifications in the virtual model to address the high computational burden. Multiple zone VAV systems usually serve a larger number of thermal zones, which introduce a higher level of interconnection in the system and activate more control strategies (e.g. control of thermal zone groups over the mode of operation). Simulating more zones and more detailed control sequences would further the realistic representation of the control system, but might prove to be challenging because of the associated computational burden. Future researchers can investigate uncertainty quantification methods/theory that might help reduce the computational burden of the problem; evaluate the impact of uncertainty in more complex scenarios with an increased number of zones and additional HVAC system configurations; evaluate sequences of operation that incorporate central plants and hydronic strategies; and evaluate the methods applied in this study in real-world implementation. In the UA, uncertainty in all components was simulated simultaneously with one accuracy level (e.g. medium accuracy) to evaluate its influence on performance\u2014three severities of accuracy were evaluated in three studies. The results informed specification of one accuracy level in all components. Future research can investigate different severities of uncertainty simulated simultaneously in order to tailor the accuracy specification of the components. In the SA, components uncertainty was observed to have small influence on performance because only one component out of the nineteen used in the control system was simulated with uncertainty. In addition, uncertainty was quantified for the combination of medium component accuracies to represent a typical commercial building application. Uncertainty was not quantified for the combination of low component accuracies because of the computational burden associated with implementing the SA. If uncertainty was quantified for low accuracy components, the components uncertainty is expected to have influenced performance more significantly. The SA results for the medium accuracy components were adopted since it has been shown to provide acceptable accuracy in distinguishing the key components and the components with the least significance, such that focus be given to the key components. Potential future research has also been noted to identify the root cause for improvement in thermal comfort and degradation in energy use that was observed in the UA of low accuracy components; and investigate cost-benefit analysis to evaluate the relationship between the cost of the wasted energy and the cost savings associated with specification of component accuracy.

Appendix A: Modelica Buildings Library implementation for the VAV system under study Wetter et al. [60] ongoing work in OpenBuildingControl (OBC) is intended to develop tools and processes for the performance evaluation, specification, deployment and verification of building control sequences. The OBC example application compared the performance of ASHRAE Sequences of Operation for Common HVAC Systems [61] and ASHRAE G36 [4]. We built the virtual models in this work based on the structure of OBC implementation for ASHRAE G36 that is maintained as open-source models in the MBL. We introduced adjustments and new models to the virtual models customized to the research objectives in this work. For example, we introduced new stochastic models using the open-source Modelica noise sub-library [62] that is maintained in the MSL. JModelica.org version 2.1 textual simulation environment was used in this study. A detailed schematic representing the MBL implementation for the building and HVAC system models is provided in Fig. A1 . The schematic shows the building model in the top right, the terminal unit models in the center right, the AHU model in the center left, and the input and output signals for the components simulated with uncertainty in the bottom left and the bottom right, respectively. Fig. A2 shows ASHRAE G36 MBL control model schematic with the two terminal unit controllers (conVAV) in the top left, the control logic to decide the mode of operation (TSetZon) in the center left, the AHU controller (conAHU) in the center, and control logic responsible to disable the stochastic effects added to the actuator positions when the actuators were either fully open or fully closed in the right of the figure. The latter, which is an adjustment to OBC virtual models, simulated the real-world actuator positioning error being zero at these two cases. Fig. A3 shows the AHU controller MBL model schematic with the supply fan controller (supFan) in the bottom left, the control logic for the supply air temperature set-point (supTemSetPoi) in the center, the control logic for calculating minimum outdoor airflow rate (outAirSetPoi) in the bottom center, the control logic for the AHU coil valves (val) in the top center, and the economizer controller (eco) in the center right. Fig. A4 shows the terminal unit controller MBL model schematic with the cooling and heating PI control loops (conCooLoo and conHeaLoo) in the top left, the control logic for the active airflow rate set-point (actAirSet) in the bottom left, the damper and valve controller (damVal) in the center, and the control logic to calculate the number of system requests for AHU temperature set-point reset and duct static pressure set-point reset (sysReq) in the center right. For further original virtual sub-models, before being adjusted for this work, that were integrated to implement ASHRAE G36 control sequences of operation, the reader is referred to the OBC implementation for ASHRAE G36 in the MBL [34].

        "dc:description": "Control sequences for air distribution and terminal systems in heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) aim to achieve a balance in the system outputs, i.e., maintain thermal comfort and indoor air quality (IAQ) with minimal energy use. ASHRAE Guideline 36 (G36) \u2013 High-Performance Sequences of Operation for HVAC Systems, is the result of ASHRAE research project 1455-RP intended to develop standardized sequences of operation to achieve more effective use of existing controls. This paper complements G36 by evaluating the influence of the uncertainty inherent in the control components (e.g. sensors and actuators) on the system outputs of a multiple zone variable air volume (VAV) system. The system outputs under study were zone air temperature, relative humidity, carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration, and site electricity use. To evaluate the effects of uncertainty in HVAC systems with advanced sequences of operation, this work applies a Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis to a detailed Modelica building energy model that has been programmed with G36 control sequences. Uncertainty models were integrated with the deterministic models of the building and the control sequence at small time scales to represent frequencies in which a real-world building automation system (BAS) samples its signals. The impact of uncertainty was quantified using annual simulations. Specification of the accuracy levels in the components of the control system were evaluated by the means of: 1) uncertainty analysis for low, medium, and high severities of accuracy in the components to identify relation between performance requirements and component accuracy, and 2) sensitivity analysis to identify the sensors and actuators where the impact of uncertainty on the system outputs is most influential.",
