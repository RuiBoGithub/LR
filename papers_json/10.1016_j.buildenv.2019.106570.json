This paper aims to present a multi-objective simulation-based optimization of architectural specifications and control parameters of a smart shading blind. Using the proposed method, implementation of control strategies on the window shading device and simultaneous optimization leads to a significant reduction in building energy consumption, and occupants' thermal and visual discomfort. Simulations are carried out using EnergyPlus, objective functions and decision-making parameters are identified by jEPlus, and multi-objective optimization is done by jEPlus + EA through NSGA-II. Optimization of the controlled blind is implemented in a typical office room located on a middle floor of a building, and the results are evaluated for four window orientations in six different climatic regions of Iran according to Köppen-Geiger climate classification. The decision variables are shading control strategy and its set-points and shading location, dimensions, angle, and material. The annual total building energy consumption, the predicted percentage of dissatisfied (PPD) and the discomfort glare index (DGI) are also considered as three objective functions minimized simultaneously. The weighted sum method is used to select the final answer from Pareto solutions. According to the results, based on the climate and the window orientation, the proposed optimization method leads to 2.8\u201347.8% decrease in the annual total building energy consumption compared to the initial design simultaneously with 15.5\u201369.9%, and 8.5\u201356.3% reduction in DGI and PPD indexes, respectively. The results clearly show how appropriate selection of the shadings specifications and their control strategy parameters can significantly not only prevent energy losses but also provide better occupants\u2019 thermal and visual comfort. Keywords EnergyPlus Shading control strategy NSGA-II Thermal comfort Visual comfort Building energy simulation 1 Introduction Humanity has been heavily energy-dependent since the earliest time it began to use the energy of burning to provide its own heat, up to now, when most of daily used equipment works by various sources of energy. Statistics show that while the world population growth is around 50% in the next forty years, the energy demand grows by about 80% [1]. By the growth of industry and the advancement of technology, human needs are not ended up with factories, and other sectors such as agriculture, transport, and buildings are also main consumers of energy. It is worth mentioning that about 40% of the worldwide energy consumption and 36% of the worldwide production of the carbon dioxide is attributed to the building sector, which has a significant contribution [2]. Windows play a crucial role in building energy performance. They are the only source of direct solar energy which provides a free source of energy and lighting while at the same time may cause overheating. Therefore, choosing an appropriate sunlight entry strategy can have a serious influence on the building's performance. There are many previous research works on the use of shading devices and the effect of their control strategies on the buildings' energy consumption and the residents' comfort. Konstantoglou et al. [3] reviewed some previous studies on the shading systems and the lighting performance control. According to their research, unlike static systems, the use of automatic shades and automatic lighting systems are growing in the design of buildings' facades to improve their energy performance. The most important question that arises is which of these systems have the best effect on building energy performance and the thermal and visual comfort of the occupants. They also reviewed a motorized blind and examined the impact of different strategies on it. According to the results, energy-saving with automatic blind control depends on the type of control strategy and its relationship with the dimmable electric lighting system. In another work, Scarning et al. [4] investigated the effect of dynamic solar shading on the overheating of residential buildings. Their research compared the effect of the combination of different glazing specifications, window dimensions and different dynamic shading scenarios on the energy consumption, daylight and thermal comfort of a low heating load building. They found that under certain conditions, with the presence of dynamic shading, thermal comfort can be improved by up to 15%. Xiong et al. [5] used dynamic facades with lighting and shading control systems in office spaces to increase visual comfort and reduce lighting energy consumption. They used two different sensors to control the glare and three different indicators of daylight glare probability (DGP), daylight brightness and vertical illumination as objective functions. They improved the shading operation and, at the same time, reduced occupants' discomfort and increased the life of the equipment. Bellia et al. [6] conducted a review of the shading systems in buildings. In recent years, various types of shades have been investigated, depending on the orientation and location of the building, characteristics of windows, and so on. They can improve or weaken the thermal and lighting performance of the buildings from the perspective of energy consumption and the inhabitants\u2019 comfort. In their article, they wrote a report on the critical analysis of some studies that examined the effects of shading devices on the building energy and lighting performance and found that it is difficult to compare the jobs due to climatic conditions, locations, specifications, and methods. So, protocols are needed to make things done globally comparable. According to their observations, there has been also very little research on the effect of the presence of shading devices on thermal comfort, and economic and environmental issues. Oleskowicz et al. [7] investigated the effect of roller blinds on the heat loss through a double-glazed and low-emissivity glasses, in the hot season nights in central Europe. The parameters were the hourly outside air temperature, wind speed, and sky temperature. They showed that the use of internal and external roller blinds reduced the window heat loss by about 33% and 45%, respectively. In another research work, Yun et al. [8] considered the importance of external blind control and its impact on energy consumption and residents' comfort. The purpose of their research was to propose a suitable threshold calculation method for activating the blind and the angle of the external blind slats in different conditions. The variables were climate conditions, building orientation, window to wall ratio, and control purpose (weighting factor). They used the Köppen-Geiger climate classification and selected four different conditions, including Singapore, Phoenix, Hamburg, and Incheon. The blind function was evaluated based on the discomfort glare index (DGI) and lighting energy consumption. They concluded that in order to achieve greater comfort, the blind slats should have larger angles, and vice versa if the energy parameter is considered, the window performs better without a blind. Hoffmann et al. [9] made a balance between three goals of energy, glare, and daylight using fenestration modeling tools and shading systems. They used EnergyPlus, WINDOW and Radiance software to calculate the heat transfer, glare, and brightness. They examined two different systems, one with a constant power lighting system and another one with a daylighting control system. In this study, they investigated 12 different shade models in geography, materials and cut-off angles in two different weather conditions in California. An optimal blind angle was predicted for each case. In addition, they showed that material specifications do not affect the energy consumption of the first system, which constant electric lighting was assumed, but have a significant effect on the second one. Firlag et al. [10] studied control algorithms for dynamic windows in residential buildings. They compared five different algorithms using the WINDOW program to extract window properties and EnergyPlus to model the building's thermal behavior. By EMS feature of EnergyPlus to apply arbitrary control algorithms, the results were obtained for four different climate zones. They found that the use of automatic shade can reduce energy consumption by about 11.6\u201313%. In addition, the control algorithm had a strong effect on the shading devices' performance. Tzempelikos et al. [11] investigated the simultaneous effect of glass area, shading device properties, and shading control system on the building cooling and lighting energy demand. The interaction between the lighting and cooling energy consumption in perimeter spaces was evaluated as a function of the window to wall ratio and shading device parameters. They concluded that if an integrated approach to the motorized automatic shading in conjunction with controllable lighting systems were taken into account, a significant reduction in energy consumption can be achieved. Yeon et al. [12] apply an artificial neural network to minimize the total energy consumption of a building, including cooling, heating and lighting energy, using automatic blind slat angle control. They simulated a three-story office building with EnergyPlus and then coupled it with MATLAB through BCVTB. As a result of their work, the automatic control of the blind slat angle consumed 9.1% less energy than the 50° slat angle fixed mode. There have been also many research works on the study of the effect of building architectural parameters on its energy performance. Machairas et al. [13] reviewed the software and algorithms used for building performance optimization. The purpose of their research was to identify the capabilities of the algorithms and available optimization software to help designers to select the appropriate method for each building optimization problem. Delgarm et al. [14,15] proposed an efficient method for simulation-based multi-objective optimization problems that illustrated the important constraints of the building energy performance optimization. In their research, single- and multi-objective optimization algorithms were coupled with EnergyPlus. The decision variables included building orientation, wall material, window dimensions, overhang depth, and so on. Based on the results, they optimized the annual total energy consumption of a typical room including cooling, heating and lighting energy in four different climates of Iran. Penna et al. [16] considered decision-making factors of wall insulation, roof insulation, lighting system, and air conditioning system to study occupants' thermal comfort, total cost and energy performance in a residential building to reach a zero-energy building. They used TRNSYS to simulate the building's thermal behavior and MATLAB for optimization procedures. To investigate the capability of the simulation-based optimization method, it was implemented in an existing building. The results showed that the proposed optimization method results in a significant reduction in energy demand more than 57%, but it is always accompanied by a reduction in thermal comfort. Sambou et al. [17] optimized the thermophysical properties of materials used in multi-layer walls to enhance the occupants\u2019 thermal comfort in the summer and reduce the energy consumption in the winter. They considered thickness, conductivity coefficient, density and specific heat as decision-makers and selected thermal resistance and indoor thermal capacitance as objective functions. In another study, Murray et al. [18] optimized a building thermal performance using a simulation-based process. In their study, the degree-days tool was used to evaluate the energy consumption of buildings in various climates, and then, to optimize the energy consumption of buildings. They coupled the degree-days tool with a genetic algorithm, and eventually put their method on a building in a cold climate. The results showed that using this method of energy building optimization, a significant amount of energy consumption can be reduced. Although shading controls have been frequently discussed in previous research works, an optimization scheme to select optimal functional and physical properties of shadings based on the climate seems essential. Therefore, in this research, the blind shading and its control strategy specifications are optimized using the annual total building energy consumption, and thermal and visual discomfort as objective functions. EnergyPlus is used as the building energy modeling software and jEPlus + EA software is used to perform the optimization through NSGA-II. The results show how different control strategies and architectural parameters of shading devices can help reducing energy consumption and increasing occupants\u2019 comfort. 2 Methodology 2.1 Building energy simulation software Due to the complex design of today's buildings, as well as the desirable development of building energy simulation software, their use is now widely accepted. Over time, precise programs such as DOE-2, BLAST, EnergyPlus, and TRNSYS have been introduced and gained popularity among architects and engineers. The first version of EnergyPlus software was codified by the US Department of Energy (DOE) in 2001 and it has been updated many times during recent years. Two of DOE-2 and BLAST software used in the late 70s to calculate building thermal loads [19] can be named as parents of EnergyPlus. EnergyPlus uses the thermal equilibrium concept to calculate the building's thermal behavior [20,21]. Although EnergyPlus has many capabilities, it cannot perform any optimization operation. Therefore, secondary software is needed for this purpose. In this research, JEPlus + EA is used as an optimization program. This software is powered by Java programming language and was published firstly by Yi Zhang at the Institute of Energy and Sustainable Development of De Montfort University in 2009. JEPlus is also used to define EnergyPlus design parameters as decision variables and EnergyPlus outputs as objective functions. jEPlus alone allows users to perform a parametric study on arbitrary input parameters through EnergyPlus and TRNSYS [22,23]. 2.2 Thermal comfort One of the most important issues for the ideal design of buildings is the provision of thermal comfort for residents. According to ISO 7730 and ASHRAE 55 Standard [24,25], thermal comfort is \u201cthat condition of mind which expresses satisfaction with the thermal environment\u201d [25]. The main factors affecting thermal comfort are activity level, clothing insulation level, mean radiant temperature, air temperature, air relative humidity, and air velocity [26]. The Fanger's Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) [27,28] index is used in this study defines as: (1) P M V = f ( I c l , M , t a , t m r t , p a , v ) where \u2018Icl\u2019 indicates the clothing insulation level in \u201cclo\u201d, \u2018M\u2019 is related to metabolic rate, \u2018ta\u2019 is the air temperature in \u201c°C\u201d, tmrt is the mean radiant temperature in \u201c°C\u201d, \u2018pa\u2019 is the relative humidity, and \u2018v\u2019 is the air velocity in \u201cm/s\u201d; Which the first two relate to the personal conditions of people, and the next four are environmental conditions [28]. This model was derived from a thermal balance equilibrium and empirical data collected from a controlled air compartment under stable conditions [27]. The comfort zone is defined by a combination of six abovementioned parameters in which PMV is within the range of −0.5 to +0.5. Under these conditions, the Predicted Percentage of Dissatisfied (PPD) is below 10% [25,27]. The following equation defines the relationship between PMV and PPD: (2) P P D = 100 − 95 exp ( − 0.03353 P M V 4 − 0.2179 P M V 2 ) 2.3 Visual comfort EnergyPlus uses Discomfort Glare Index (DGI) to calculate visual discomfort at the reference point provided by the user [29]. Discomfort Glare causes a person to instinctively turn his eyes off a light source or makes it difficult for the person to see Ref. [30]. DGI is the most cited model to predict the Discomfort Glare [31] and is defined as [32]: (3) D G I = 10 l o g 10 [ 0.478 ∑ i = 1 n ( L s i 1.6 Ω s i 0.8 L b + 0.07 Ω s i L w i n P i 1.6 ) ] where Lsi, Lb, and Lwin is the luminance of the glare source, the background and the window in \u201ccd/m2\u201d, respectively. In addition, Ωsi is the solid angle subtended by the glare source from the occupants' point of view modified by Guth's position index, i.e., Pi. n is the number of glare sources [32]. For office buildings, the maximum allowable threshold for DGI is 22 [29]. 2.4 Shading control One of the purposes of this work is to choose a proper control strategy for windows shading devices. Control schemes itself contains many parameters that can act as decision variables. As listed in Table 1 , in this study, 19 shading control strategies are applied, each of them has separate and different effects on the building cooling, heating, and lighting energy consumption, and occupant's thermal and visual comfort: It should be noted that in all cases, activating the shading means it covers the window and restricts the entry of sunlight and disabling it means that the window is not covered by the shading and the sunlight can enter the room. 2.5 Multi-objective optimization As multi-objective optimization problems have more than one objective function and they usually change oppositely, their solution is not unique. A set of solutions that are not superior to each other is called Pareto front [33,34]. One of the best-known algorithms in the field of multi-objective optimization is the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA) [35] whose second version was introduced as NSGA-II in 2002 [36-38]. Since there are no constraints on the selection of continuous and discrete decision variables in this algorithm, NSGA-II is used as an optimization method in this work. Multi-objective simulation-based optimization is performed using jEPlus + EA software in this research [23]. Using an rvx-formatted file, the objective functions are also defined according to the outputs of EnergyPlus. Due to the creation of many design parameters permutations, an optimization algorithm is needed to evaluate different situations and present the results. For this purpose, the jEPlus + EA is used to optimize scenarios created by jEPlus through NSGA-II method and presents the Pareto front of objective functions, as well as the corresponding decision parameters. Therefore, in this study, besides various control strategies implemented on windows\u2019 shading devices, optimization is done without any limitation of architectural and control parameters related to shading devices. In this way, the appropriate control strategy for each window orientation according to the algorithm is chosen, and the optimal activation threshold corresponding to it is coordinated with the other parameters in the best manner according to the algorithm. Fig. 1 shows how to link between EnergyPlus as the simulator software and the optimization algorithm [23]. 3 Modeling materials 3.1 Model specifications In the present paper, the optimization of the shading parameters is implemented in a unit of a large office building, which is shown in Fig. 2 . It is assumed that the room is located in one of the middle floors of the building so that all of its envelopes including walls, ceiling, and floor are internal ones without heat transfer except the wall with a window which is external. The room has length, width, and height of 10, 5 and 3 m, respectively, which are typical dimensions of large office rooms in Iran. In addition, U values of the envelope elements are according to the Iranian National Building Regulations as summarized in Table 2 [39]. A fixed double-glazed (6 mm clear glazings with a 13 mm air gap) window with a blind shading with a height of 1.5 m is located in the middle of the external wall and provides a 50% window-to-wall ratio. The room is equipped with a packaged terminal heat pump air conditioner (PTHP) whose capacity is automatically calculated by taking into account the warmest and the coldest days of the year. The heating and cooling set-points of PTHP are 22 and 26 °C, respectively, in the working hours of Iran, i.e., Saturday to Wednesday from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. In addition, the heating and cooling set-back temperatures are 18 and 30 °C, respectively, during the non-working hours. It is assumed that there are 5 persons with 125 W/person activity levels in the office room whose clothing level is calculated based on the Dynamic ASHRAE 55 Clothing Model [25]. The rate of fresh air entering the room is assumed to be 9.44 L/s per person [29]. Room electrical equipment is only available during the working hours and is assumed to consume 450 W constantly. A 500 Watts fluorescent artificial lighting system is used in working hours whose power can be dimmed by a daylight sensor with an activation threshold of 500 lux to control the room luminance automatically when the sun natural light is not sufficient. The sensor is located in the middle of the room and at 0.8 m above the floor (desk height) [29]. 3.2 Climatic regions of Iran According to the Köppen-Geiger climate classification [40], Iran has six major climatic regions as summarized in Table 3 . For each climate, a representative big city which is the capital of one of Iran provinces is chosen whose specifications are listed in Table 3. It is worth mentioning that Tehran is the capital city of Iran. 3.3 Optimization method The main goal of the present research is to optimize the shading blind and its control strategy specifications. Therefore, the shading control strategy and its control set-point(s), and the shading location, slat dimensions, and material specifications are selected as decision variables, and the multi-objective optimization is done for 24 cases, including four window orientations and six climate conditions. Table 4 shows the variables, their ranges, and their initial values and Fig. 3 shows the physical characteristics of the blind. It is worth mentioning that the initial model has no blind (strategy No. 2 means the blind is disabled). As a result, other specifications of the blind are only necessary to start the optimization process and they have no effect on the results. The annual total energy consumed by cooling, heating, and lighting systems, the annual average predicted percentage of dissatisfied (PPD) and the annual average discomfort glare index (DGI) are considered as the objective functions, which are calculated only in working hours. It is important to note that in many cases, the decision variables have an inverse effect on the objective functions. For example, in the cold seasons in which the building needs to be heated, the absence of the shading throughout the days helps to reduce HVAC and lighting systems energy consumption, while at the same time it may cause visual discomfort. In the same season during the nights, the use of insulating materials for the shading devices can reduce the electricity consumption of the heating system. During the hot seasons, even though the shading reduces HVAC system energy requirement, it prevents the entry of natural light and increases the energy consumed by the artificial lighting system. In addition, under these conditions, the change of parameters to reduce the total electricity consumption may cause thermal or visual discomfort. By preliminary convergence analysis, the population size, the maximum generation number, the crossover rate, and the mutation rate are assumed 40, 80, 100% and 20%, respectively. Using a workstation with 2.6 GHz Intel™ Core i7-6700HQ quad-core processor, each optimization run needs about 2 h to be completed. 4 Results and discussions Three-dimensional Pareto fronts of the NSGA-II optimization are presented in Fig. 4 for four window orientations in Tehran. As shown in the figure, the optimization procedure provides a variety of results that each point on the front is an optimal solution. To find the final optimum solution among Pareto front points, in this study, the weighted sum method [41\u201343] is used as a decision-making method using Eq. (4): (4) f w s ( x ) = ∑ i = 1 3 a i f i ( x ) − f i ( x ) m i n f i ( x ) m a x − f i ( x ) m i n where f i ( x ) are the objective functions including annual electricity consumption, PPD, and DGI. Similarly, f i ( x ) m i n and f i ( x ) m a x are the minimum and maximum of each objective function, respectively. a i is also the weighting factor of the objective function. As PPD and DGI are both indicators for the occupants' comfort, we assume that they have the same importance. So: (5) a 2 = a 3 = 1 − a 1 2 In this way, a multi-objective optimization problem becomes a single-objective one in which f w s ( x ) is minimized and its only decision parameter is a 1 . For the next discussions, Table 5 presents the values of objective functions for the initial case in Tehran for the south-facing window. In addition, the effect of annual electricity consumption weighting coefficient, a 1 , on the decision variables and objective functions are shown in Table 6 for the south-facing window in Tehran as the capital of Iran which is in the cold semi-arid climate region. Considering the importance of building energy consumption, for further discussions, the main focus in choosing the final solution is laid down on this objective function. As a result, by changing the annual electricity consumption weighting coefficient, a 1 , the lowest value by which the occupants are in the comfort zone (i.e., DGI is less than 22 and PPD is less than 10%) is selected as a proper coefficient for each case. As shown in Table 6, increment in coefficient a 1 led to a reduction in the annual electricity consumption, while thermal and visual discomfort increased. So that when a 1 = 0 and a 2 = a 3 = 0.5 , although the annual electricity consumption was very high, DGI and PPD had very low values. On the other hand, when a 1 = 1 , while the electricity consumption was low, DGI had gone above the standard. In addition, as it is evident from Table 6 when a 1 had a lower value, i.e. the comfort indexes were more important, the optimum slat angle was lower and the blind was more closed which led to lower DGI. On the contrary, when a 1 increased, shading location changed to exterior, which had more effect in reducing electricity consumption due to preventing the solar heat gain from entering the room. Blind to glass distances had also lower values when a 1 was low, to improve visual comfort. The last two cases also illustrate the important point that if the annual electricity consumption is the most important function to be minimized, those strategies were selected that allows sunlight to enter the room during days, which reduces the lighting electricity consumption over the year and heating demand in winter. The abovementioned analysis was only for the south-facing window in the climate condition of Tehran and obviously, the optimum values are different in other cases whose optimum objective functions are summarized and compared to the initial case values in Fig. 5 for different window orientations in six climatic regions of Iran. In addition, their optimal decision variables are shown in Tables 7\u201312 . It should be noted that the decision variables of the initial case were presented before in Table 4. As mentioned previously, reducing energy consumption in many cases treats the opposite of the occupants\u2019 thermal and visual comfort. Accordingly, different window orientations in different climates require different strategies so that by choosing the proper decision-making variables and NSGA-II optimization method, an optimal solution can be obtained. Another important point is that the first objective function consists of three terms, i.e. cooling, heating, and lighting, which in many cases act in the opposite direction. For example, by activating the shading at lower thresholds, the cooling energy consumption decreases in the hot seasons while the reduction of sunlight enters the room increases the building heating and lighting energy demands. Based on the results, a proper control strategy with a suitable activation threshold can reduce the building energy consumption while improving the thermal and visual comfort of residents. The results indicate that depending on the window orientation, the optimal strategy is different. Note that although the HVAC system is only active during the working hours, the shading control is always carried out. Therefore, some temperature-based strategies are activated at temperatures other than the thermostat set-points, such as the west-facing window in Esfahan in which the shading device is activated when the inside room temperature is higher than 16.8 °C. Solar-based strategies always disable shading devices during the night, which reduces the cooling load during the warm seasons. Furthermore, since solar-based strategies are activated or disabled on the basis of solar irradiance which directly affects DGI, these strategies are fast response and show better performance. According to the results, to control the visual comfort the slat angle is different in each climate and window orientation. Naturally, the lower the angle, the blind is more closed and, consequently, DGI is less, which is evident in the above tables. So, in all cases, the slat angle is in a range to reduce DGI below 22 as well as prevents the cooling load increment. In Tabriz, which represents the humid continental climate of Iran, and has the lowest temperatures throughout the year among the studied cities, entrance of the sunlight to receive its heat is useful in reducing the building heating energy consumption. Therefore, applying shading strategies, while improving the occupants\u2019 thermal and visual comfort, increases the building energy consumption, in all window orientations except the south one, due to reduction of the solar radiation. In Yazd and Shiraz as hot desert and hot semi-arid representatives, respectively, in all window orientations, with the implementation of the optimum shading control strategies, compared to the initial model values, all objective functions decrease so that in Shiraz the total annual energy consumption, PPD, and DGI reduce 2.8\u201343.8%, 22.5\u201352.2%, and 23.2\u201326.8%, respectively. In Yazd, the total annual energy consumption, PPD, and DGI also decrease 8.9\u201341.3%, 8.5\u201355.2%, and 22.8\u201330.5%, respectively, compared to the initial model values. Furthermore, in most cities, using a shading device on the north-facing window, which has the lowest hours of sun exposure, does not have a favorable effect on reducing the heating and lighting energy consumption, although both discomfort indexes, i.e., PPD and DGI, are significantly reduced. On the contrary, for the south-facing window, the shading control has the greatest impact on the reduction of all three objective functions due to a considerable reduction in solar irradiation which leads to the reduction of the building energy consumption, thermal discomfort, and discomfort glare index. Considering the optimum decision-making variables, it can be said that in most cases choosing the external blind is more effective to prevent excessive cooling load and therefore to reduce the annual electricity consumption, especially in warmer climates and in the window orientations that are more exposed to sunlight. The results also show that in solar-based strategies if the window sun exposure is more, the lower activation threshold for the shading device is appropriate. On the contrary, if temperature-based or load-based strategies are chosen, the higher activation thresholds are suggested. Moreover, although the higher slat reflectance leads to increment in DGI, it improves the energy and thermal performance of the building. The higher slat conductivity values have also little impact on the building energy demand reduction and PPD increment, respectively, while it has no effect on DGI. It can be said that none of the decision-making variables in this study are decisive alone and depending on the circumstances should be chosen together and interdependently so that the optimum values of the objective functions and can be achieved. Comparison of the initial and optimum objective functions in different climates in Fig. 5, indicates that the most annual electricity consumption is related to the east-facing window of Tehran and the least one is related to the north-facing window of Sari, due to amount and duration of sunlight enters the building, and its impact on the total heating and cooling loads and lighting electricity consumption. In addition, based on the results, annual energy consumption decreases by about 2.8\u201347.8%, and DGI and PPD decrease about 15.5\u201369.9% and 8.5\u201356.3%, respectively, compared to the initial model values. Moreover, due to the decrease in cooling energy consumption by activating the shading device, the effect of the implementation of these strategies on the annual electricity consumption and PPD has increased from cold to hot climates. 5 Conclusions In this paper, to focus more on the shading specifications and control strategies, a typical office room from one of the middle floors of a building was considered as a model. EnergyPlus was coupled with jEPlus + EA through the NSGA-II method to optimize the results. The annual total building electricity consumption, and thermal and visual discomfort indexes, i.e. DGI and PPD, were selected as objective functions and the shading control strategy and its set-point(s), shading location, slat angle, shading dimensions, and its material specifications were selected as decision variables. Comparing the results of multi-objective optimization of controlled blind specifications with the initial values indicated that, based on the climate, the annual total building energy consumption decreased by about 2.8\u201347.8%, while at the same time DGI and PPD reduced 15.5\u201369.9%, and 8.5\u201356.3%, respectively. According to the results, using appropriate control strategy and selecting proper shading specifications can significantly not only decrease the building energy demand but also enhance occupants\u2019 thermal and visual comfort. So that applying the exterior blind led in reducing the annual electricity consumption more than the interior one. Furthermore, the lower slat angles caused more visual comfort, although it had a negative effect on lighting electricity consumption. Similarly, the other shading parameters were optimized and eventually, in order to select the final solution from the multi-objective optimization problem, the weighted sum method was used and, in each case, the final optimum configuration was chosen based on the lowest energy consumption in which the residents' thermal and visual comfort is below the allowable thresholds. It also deserves to be mentioned that in addition to some possible differences between actual climatic data and the EnergyPlus weather data file, another limitation of this study was the period over which the objective functions were evaluated. Due to a large amount of data, all three objective functions were assessed annually in the present work. Using other periods such as season, month or even day may lead to different behavior which can be investigated in future research works.

        "dc:description": "This paper aims to present a multi-objective simulation-based optimization of architectural specifications and control parameters of a smart shading blind. Using the proposed method, implementation of control strategies on the window shading device and simultaneous optimization leads to a significant reduction in building energy consumption, and occupants' thermal and visual discomfort. Simulations are carried out using EnergyPlus, objective functions and decision-making parameters are identified by jEPlus, and multi-objective optimization is done by jEPlus + EA through NSGA-II. Optimization of the controlled blind is implemented in a typical office room located on a middle floor of a building, and the results are evaluated for four window orientations in six different climatic regions of Iran according to Köppen-Geiger climate classification. The decision variables are shading control strategy and its set-points and shading location, dimensions, angle, and material. The annual total building energy consumption, the predicted percentage of dissatisfied (PPD) and the discomfort glare index (DGI) are also considered as three objective functions minimized simultaneously. The weighted sum method is used to select the final answer from Pareto solutions. According to the results, based on the climate and the window orientation, the proposed optimization method leads to 2.8\u201347.8% decrease in the annual total building energy consumption compared to the initial design simultaneously with 15.5\u201369.9%, and 8.5\u201356.3% reduction in DGI and PPD indexes, respectively. The results clearly show how appropriate selection of the shadings specifications and their control strategy parameters can significantly not only prevent energy losses but also provide better occupants\u2019 thermal and visual comfort.",
