With global trends in electrification, communities highly dependent on electricity are facing increasing challenges, particularly due to more frequent weather events, which lead to significant surges in electricity demand or result in blackouts. However, the impact is disproportionate across space and time, which raises an urgent need to comprehensively assess residential energy vulnerabilities to ensure energy security for households. Existing methodologies, whether large-scale regional assessments or community-based surveys, predominantly rely on static data. This reliance significantly limits their ability to capture the spatial and temporal dynamics of energy vulnerability, which is particularly important in the face of climate change. This study analyses residential energy vulnerability in the dimensions of social vulnerability, building resilience, and energy burden by innovatively linking occupancy patterns with the built environment through a Bayesian-based spatial mapping methodology. We applied this method through a case study in a Philadelphia census tract area identified for its high vulnerability based on FEMA's National Risk Index. By mapping occupancy with residential buildings, we simulated the energy consumption patterns of approximately 900 residential buildings. The simulations utilized DOE single-family energy prototypes, tailored to account for empirical occupancy and building features, to predict hourly energy consumption and assess indoor thermal comfort during power outages on days with extreme temperatures. The findings reveal disparities across different dimensions of energy vulnerability and illustrate the dynamic nature of energy vulnerability that fluctuates with daily activities. The study also highlights areas with low thermal resilience, suggesting a need for retrofitting older buildings to improve energy efficiency. The implications of this research extend beyond the built environment to the socioeconomic aspects of energy use, advocating for adaptive community planning and the development of resilient energy infrastructures. The results serve as a foundation for stakeholders to implement targeted interventions, prioritize retrofitting efforts, and support equitable access to energy resources, thereby enhancing urban sustainability and resilience.

Meanwhile, in the current landscape of global climate change where extreme weather events show increasing frequency, the power system is susceptible to many natural disasters such as hurricanes, wildfires, ice storms, flooding, and heat waves. For instance, cold waves and ice can break the lines, while heat waves can lower the capacity of an electric line up to the point of overloading it (Abedi et al., 2019). The effects of climate change can not only heighten the electricity demand but also compromise its supply. Furthermore, a substantial portion of the country's electrical infrastructure was not designed to operate under current climatic conditions. The report from Climate Central revealed that weather-related events were responsible for 83 percent of the power outages documented from 2000 to 2021 (Climate Central, 2022). Also, the annual number of major grid failures (those lasting at least one hour and affecting over 50,000 customers) in the U.S has risen by over 60 % in the past five years in the past five years, with nearly half of these blackout events occurring between May and September when there is high heat risk (Stone et al., 2021). This increase leads to both economic and safety challenges in communities heavily dependent on electricity, especially extreme weather and natural disasters often come with high electricity demand. To support a resilient transition towards electrification and decarbonization, there is an urgent need to assess residential energy vulnerability to ensure energy security for households, especially under extreme weather. Residential energy vulnerability is generally defined as the likelihood that a household will face limited access to affordable and reliable energy services and the potential impact on their health and well-being due to disruptions in energy supply. (Middlemiss & Gillard, 2015; Bouzarovski & Bouzarovski, 2018; Drago & Gatto, 2023). Compared with widely studied and reviewed methodologies for power infrastructure vulnerability analysis, vulnerability facing the failure with energy provision on consumers such as potential economic damage or human mortality and morbidity has scarcely been investigated (Abedi et al., 2019). In some studies, the impact is assessed indirectly by studying how power failure influences other critical infrastructures, which are defined as organizations or institutions providing vital services and products to the population (Ouyang & Dueñas-Osorio, 2014). For the direct impact, there are some qualitative approaches such as questionnaires and interviews in case studies to survey communities that have gone through the power outage (Ghanem et al., 2016). Other studies proposing energy vulnerability assessment frameworks rely on large geographical scale data such as census data to assess the overall community energy vulnerability (Murias et al., 2020). These assessment methods failed to capture the dynamic feature of residential energy vulnerability both in spatial and temporal dimensions. To fill this gap, this study proposed Bayesian spatial mapping to establish a link between occupancy demographics and building features, so we can integrate data in the two different dimensions together. Then, combined with simulated schedules of various demographic groups, we can further profile the energy vulnerability for specific residential buildings. With the spatial-temporal dynamic residential energy vulnerability distribution, responses and resource allocations can be adjusted depending on the time of power outages. Additionally, by presenting energy vulnerability in different dimensions, this study provides a basis for electrification strategies to be more customized, such as identifying buildings that need more retrofitting or better backup energy alternatives. 2 Literature review 2.1 Household energy vulnerability The concept of household energy vulnerability has been defined in multiple studies. For example, Day and Walker (et al. 2013) define it as households showing limited access to affordable and reliable energy services, leading to risks of harm to their health and well-being; Middlemiss and Gillard (2015) draw it as the likelihood of a household experiencing energy poverty, the sensitivity to energy poverty, and their ability to adapt to changes in energy poverty through substantial research of vulnerability to climate change on theory. Bouzarovski and Bouzarovski (2018) also defined energy vulnerability with probabilistic thinking that extends the factors of energy poverty tendency beyond affordability and accessibility to encompass the built environment, social practices, and energy needs. Despite the variations in the definitions, all these approaches have two aspects in common. Firstly, they consider household energy vulnerability as a dynamic potentiality or risk in terms of space and time, where a household may enter or exit energy poverty after a change in housing, social, political, or economic circumstances (Simcock et al., 2017). This results in the energy vulnerability demographic always being larger than that of people who are in energy poverty. Moreover, they acknowledge the multidimensional nature of household energy vulnerability, which reveals that different households will hold different degrees of vulnerability, according to their built environment variation and energy-related social practices. Given its concept, energy vulnerability assessment often involves the aspect of social, economic, and environmental factors. To integrate all these dimensions, while some research proposes to add the dimension of energy-related index to the current social vulnerability index (Song et al., 2024), some other researchers propose to build new energy vulnerability indexes. For example, Genave et al. (2020) built an energy vulnerability index based on Multi-Layer Benefit-of-the-Doubt techniques, which enables the identification of economic, environmental, and social dimensions that play an important role in the relative energy vulnerability of Small Island Developing States. Similarly, Gatto and Busato (2020) used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to propose a global energy vulnerability index (GEVI) with the theoretical basis of four sustainability dimensions\u2013 societal, economic, environmental, and governance to measure the energy vulnerability of 146 countries. Compared with the traditional assessment framework, they add a new dimension of governance. In terms of the spatial-temporal dynamic feature, Liu et al. (2023) claimed that most of the energy vulnerability measurements in current studies have used cross-sectional data and ignored the dynamics of energy vulnerability. Therefore, they proposed an indicator system that covers five aspects: energy access, energy efficiency, renewable energy, total energy consumption, and energy security. While there is a growing body of research trying to assess household energy vulnerability with comprehensive frameworks, the actual implications are conducted at broader geographical scales, such as globally or country-wide (Papada & Kaliampakos, 2019; Murias et al., 2020; Ahmad et al., 2021). For instance, Murias et al. (2020) constructed a conceptual framework for a household energy vulnerability synthetic index, integrating aspects of the energy, residential, physical, and socioeconomic environments. However, their application of this framework was at the provincial level in Spain. The application for larger scales in such studies is often due to the ease of accessing socio-economic data, like average family income, education, and demographic distributions, from regional public statistics. Similarly, Terés-Zubiaga et al. (2023) also proposed a Multidimensional procedure for mapping and monitoring urban energy vulnerability with existing public data, but still at the regional level. Large-scale regional assessments of energy vulnerability are undoubtedly valuable for informing some policy decisions, such as mitigating measures for targeted energy market (Papada & Kaliampakos, 2019) and incentive support for new energy technology adoption (Ahmad et al., 2021). However, for more tailored and immediate response strategies, it becomes essential to analyze energy vulnerability at a finer scale, such as individual households or smaller geographic units like census tracts or block groups. Conversely, some studies employ community-engaged research to achieve a more granular geographical analysis of energy vulnerability. For instance, Fox (2023) explored changes in energy vulnerability impacted by an increase in solar entitlements, collaborating with a social housing landlord involved in a solar program for tenants. This project enabled the acquisition of detailed information from seven participating households, enhancing the assessment of their energy vulnerability. In a broader community context, Fan et al. (2022) implemented questionnaires at a village level, followed by random sampling of households for more in-depth semi-structured interviews. Their analysis encompassed aspects of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptability to energy vulnerability. Similarly, Horta et al. (2019) gathered data through interviews with selected households in civic parishes vulnerable to energy poverty in Portugal, collecting detailed social-demographic and building feature information, along with perceptions of thermal discomfort. Then they can analyze and map the energy vulnerability distribution on a more granular geographic scale. This community-engaged approach facilitates a comprehensive analysis of energy vulnerability by allowing researchers to tailor questionnaires or surveys to capture a wide range of pertinent information. However, these methods can be time-consuming, resource-intensive, and highly contextual, which makes it challenging to replicate or adapt these methods to different areas, particularly for stakeholders looking to apply these findings in diverse settings. In addition, while household features are integral to these assessment indices and frameworks, it's important to note that households are not static entities. Their dynamic nature, characterized by activity mobility, plays a crucial role in both their energy consumption patterns and their susceptibility to power outages. Existing methodologies, whether large-scale regional assessments or community-based surveys, predominantly rely on static data. This reliance significantly limits their ability to capture the fluid and temporal dynamics of energy vulnerability, which is particularly pertinent in the face of changing environmental conditions. Therefore, our study proposes a novel approach to profile household-level energy vulnerability that can be tailored to different community contexts. Besides the occupancy characteristics, we also integrate the dynamic natures into the energy vulnerability assessment by simulating different activity patterns among various demographic groups, which not only influence their spatial distribution but also influence the energy simulation patterns. 2.2 Building and household characteristics mapping To profile energy vulnerability at the household level, one key challenge is to integrate building and household information. Generally, methods to link social science and engineering data in small geographical units require disaggregating census data (Rosenheim et al., 2021). The US Census Bureau provides socioeconomic and demographic data on households aggregated within polygons or areal units as census tracts. However, due to privacy concerns, the data that can be associated with the smallest administrative such as census block are often limited. In studies requiring lower spatial resolution, such as those at the national level, it is common to use simplistic assumptions of uniform population distribution across areal units (Lowder et al., 2016). Some studies use supplementary information such as land use data or nighttime light (NTL) imagery to generate a population surface that better captures potentially populated locations within areal units (Li & Zhou, 2018). This adds the building environment information into consideration but still does not consider the variation of the population in the different building units. For more detailed disaggregation, some researchers propose to use statistical population mapping approaches, such as spatial regression and random forest, to help assess the population distribution (Stevens et al., 2015; Song et al., 2019). During the process, the relationship between population and population-related factors is collected and analyzed in sampled small areas where detailed information can be accessible through field surveys (Weber et al., 2018). Then the relationship can be applied to targeted areas, or the estimation of high-resolution prediction results can be directly aggregated to administrative units (Wardop et al., 2018). These methods raise a concern that the demographic distribution in the sample data may not be fully representative of the demographic in the target areas (Huynh et al., 2016). Therefore, some researchers proposed to use a sample-free approach to link high-resolution spatial data with household units. For example, Rosenheim et al. (2021) built a workflow to probabilistically allocate household socio-demographic data ((i.e., size, tenure status, occupied, and vacant) to housing units in single and multi-family residential structures through a random process with Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS). However, one common issue in existing approaches is that all the mapping focuses on the overall population, which leads to the mapping result of population density without considering demographic differences. There are limited approaches to exploring the distribution of various demographics inside the identified population density, especially for small geographical area units. To address this limitation, in this study, we propose to use a sample-free approach with an exploration of demographic occupancy mapping. To reach this goal, we used Bayesian-based Spatial mapping, which considers the overall demographic distribution in the target area as priors and incorporates uncertainty into the mapping process. Leveraging this integrated data, we then aim to simulate household energy consumption patterns and conduct a thorough analysis of household energy vulnerability. 3 Research method To profile residential energy vulnerability within a specific community, the proposed method encompasses three critical dimensions: 1) Social Vulnerability: this dimension captures the demographic characteristics of households residing in the building along with their daily mobility trajectories, reflecting how lifestyle and movement patterns directly impact energy usage and vulnerability. 2) Building Resilience: we assess the ability of residential buildings to maintain thermal comfort amid dynamic and extreme temperature variations, a crucial factor in determining resilience to environmental changes. 3) Energy Burden: This aspect focuses on the dynamic interplay of socio-physical vulnerabilities that exacerbate energy consumption, particularly during peak seasons like summer and winter. Collectively, these three dimensions provide a dynamic household energy vulnerability profile based on multi-spatial and temporal scales data fusion. The pivotal component of this analysis involves the spatial mapping of these multidimensional aspects. As Fig. 1 shows, we outline our methodology as follows: first, we employ Bayesian spatial modeling techniques to integrate information map occupancy characteristics with building features. This method enables us to create spatial representations that capture the intricate interplay between these two critical facets. Then with the integrated information, we simulated household energy consumption patterns in extreme weather days and assessed the potential energy burden based on the mapped occupancy social vulnerability. Finally, the harmonious integration of social vulnerability, building, and energy burden enables the holistic profiling of residential energy vulnerability within the studied community through the Geographic Information System (GIS). Detailed elaborations on each of these methodological steps are provided in subsequent sections. 3.1 Bayesian-Based spatial mapping of occupancy and building characteristics In urban research and demographic analysis, Bayesian statistics stands out as a powerful tool for analyzing the diverse population that inhabits a given area, especially when the census data are incomplete (Leasure et al., 2020). The advantages it provides lie in two aspects. On the one hand, the adoption of Bayesian analytics helps the creation of a systematic approach that can integrate multiple data sources into a consistent, transparent knowledge framework for mapping populations in environments where a single data source is poor (Zhuang et al., 2024). On the other hand, Bayesian modeling has been increasingly used in the modeling for scenarios where understanding and quantifying uncertainty is crucial, due to its ability to update predictions with new data and effectively quantify uncertainties (Chen & Zhang, 2021; Assaf et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2024). Building on this foundation, in this study, during the high geographical resolution mapping process, we employ Bayesian-based spatial mapping to investigate the demographic distribution among populations and building characteristics with uncertainty considered. Specifically, the Bayesian spatial mapping approach operates on multiple hierarchical levels to model the distribution of demographic groups across building characteristics. This hierarchical structure allows us to incorporate both broad demographic trends and more localized variations. The model structure is as follows: First layer (census block level): At this level, we consider the overall demographic group distribution denoted as contextual adjustor [g]. This adjustor provides the contextual demographic information for the target areas, reflecting the general population structure within each census block. Second level (house level): At the second level, we delve into finer-grained priors. These priors, denoted as priorf[g], represent the probabilities of different building feature distributions among each demographic group g. For instance, the priors might indicate the likelihood of various building types (e.g., single-family house, multi-family house) within each demographic group (e.g., elderly population). To estimate the distribution of building features given the demographic groups, we utilize the Dirichlet distribution. This choice is robust for modeling probabilities because it ensures the values lie between 0 and 1 and sum to 1, which is necessary for representing proportions (Xia et al., 2023a). Also, during the calculation, to avoid too small numbers dealing with probability, we transform them into log-probabilities and use Softmax to convert log-probabilities back into probabilities that sum to 1. Specifically: (1) Prior Distribution : θ c t [ g ] ∼ D i r i c h l e t ( p r i o r f [ g ] ) Here, θ c t [ g ] represents the probabilities of different building features for demographic group g (ct-construction type, similarly, cy-construction year, hs-house area). This prior information is accessed from the Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS), which is conducted by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) for information on housing units, usage patterns, and household demographics (EIA, 2024). Incorporating contextual adjustor: (2) θ c t [ g ] ∼ D i r i c h l e t ( p r i o r f [ g ] ) * h y p e r p r i o r [ g ] ) Here, the contextual adjustor adjusts priors to reflect the local demographic composition. Log-probability calculation: (3) log ( p r o b [ g ] ) = log ( θ c t ( g , C T [ i ] ) ) + log ( θ c y ( g , C Y [ i ] ) ) + log ( θ c t ( g , H S [ i ] ) ) Here, for each demographic group g and building i, we calculate the log-probabilities based on the categorical distributions of building types ( θ c t ) , construction years ( θ c y ) , and house sizes ( θ h s ) . Calculate posterior probabilities: (4) p o s t e r i o r [ g ] = S o f t m a x ( log ( p r o b [ g ] + log ( h y p e r p i o r ) ) . Here, posterior[g], are calculated using the Softmax function on the log-probabilities adjusted by the contextual adjustor. This gives us the probability distribution of demographic groups for each building in the study area. To validate the Bayesian model prediction result, we applied the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test. K-S test is a statistical method used to compare the distributions of two independent samples. It measures the maximum distance between the empirical cumulative distribution functions (ECDFs) of the two samples, providing a d-statistic that quantifies this distance. In practice, it calculates a p-value to determine the statistical significance of the observed differences between the two distributions. If the p-value is less than a predetermined significance level (commonly set at 0.05), we reject the null hypothesis that the two samples come from the same distribution. This indicates a significant difference between the estimated and actual population structures. Conversely, a high p-value suggests that the model's predictions are consistent with the observed data (Lopes et al., 2007). Specifically in this study, we classified the targeted area into different geographical units. Based on the buildings in these areas and their assigned occupancy demographics, we calculate the population structure for each area unit. Simultaneously, we collect population structure data from the census. We then use the K-S test to compare whether the aggregated results from our Bayesian mapping are similar to the actual distribution from the real data. This validation ensures that our model accurately reflects the local population distribution. 3.2 Simulation of energy consumption patterns In this section, we explained the process of simulating energy consumption patterns within diverse residential buildings. To achieve this, we utilized the Department of Energy (DOE) residential energy prototypes, which include predefined parameters for common building types. To customize and update the model with existing data, as shown in Fig. 2 , we modified key parameters -weather conditions, occupancy schedules, and building features- as the energy model inputs. For the weather files in Philadelphia County, we used \u201cUSA PA Philadelphia.Intl.AP.724080_TMY3.epw\", which represents the Typical Meteorological Year and can be downloaded through the Energyplus weather data website. For building features, the parameters used are primarily predefined in the prototype. We selected different prototypes based on actual building type (single-family/multi-family) and construction year. Related parameters for different prototypes can refer to the International Energy Conservation Code (IECC). These standards encompassed critical aspects such as insulation, HVAC systems, lighting, and the overall building envelope. Additionally, the building area parameter was modified as a significant input. For occupancy profile-related inputs, we include we include the hourly occupancy presence schedule (OccupancyDay), lighting (LightingDay), and plug load schedule (MiscPlugLoadDay), as well as the heating and cooling set point (Heating_Sch & Cooling_Sch). These are key parameters related to occupancy that significantly influence energy consumption (Chen et al. 2023; O'Neill& Niu, 2017). For the value of these parameters input, the occupancy present schedule is simulated through the Markov Chain among different demographic groups based on the American Time Use Survey, a stochastic method detailed in our previous publication (Xia et al., 2023b). Then based on the different occupancy presence schedules, we employed the interpolation method proposed in the study by Chen et al. (2022) for customized lighting and plug load schedule calculation. As the function shows, the modified schedule X s c h e d u l e , i is calculated based on the household occupancy presence O c c u p a n c y n o r m , i during time step i, which is normalized as a fraction of maximum occupancy presence in the building throughout the day. For the referenced lighting and plug load schedule X in the prototype, X m i n is the minimum of the reference schedule for that day, X r e f e r e n c e , i is the real-time schedule value during time step i, This means that when the occupancy is at its maximum (1.0), the adjusted schedule matches the prototype schedule. If occupancy is zero, the adjusted schedule equals the minimum of the original schedule. For partial occupancy, the adjusted schedule falls between the daily minimum and the initial reference value. (5) X s c h e d u l e , i = X m i n + ( X r e f e r e n c e , i − X m i n ) * O c c u p a n c y n o r m , i Among these schedules, the heating and cooling set points hold particular importance due to their significant impact on energy consumption patterns and indoor comfort levels and their variance with demographic groups (O'Neill & Niu, 2017). While the Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) provided set point data for people at home and away across different demographic groups, we developed a specific function to calculate set points for every 15-minute interval. As function (6) shows, S g h o m e is the schedule of specific group g at home, T g h o m e is the temperature set point when group g is at home based on the RECS, S g n h o m e is the schedule of specific group g not at home, and T g n h o m e is the temperature set point when group g is not at home based on the RECS. This function then factored in the probability (p(g)) of a specific demographic group (g) being assigned to the residential building, the schedules (S) for both at-home and not-at-home scenarios, and the related set points (T). (6) T i = ∑ p ( g ) * ( S g h o m e * T g h o m e + S g n h o m e * T g n h o m e ) With these inputs established, we use EPPY to batchily modify the DOE prototype IDF files with the customized occupancy and building-related variables. Then we simulate energy consumption patterns during peak hours on extreme hot and cold days based on the Philadelphia weather file. In Philadelphia, extremely hot weather days are defined as \u201cwhen the forecast includes at least three consecutive days of 95 °F temperatures and above with high humidity\u201d, while extreme cold weather days are defined as \u201cWhen there's precipitation and the temperature is 32° Fahrenheit or lower\u201d (City of Philadelphia, 2024). For its modeling in EnergyPlus, we use typical hot and cold days defined in EnergyPlus Input Output Reference to represent these two days (U.S. Department of Energy, 2020). These typical days are based on historical weather data in Philadelphia and common practice in building energy modeling to represent peak heating and cooling loads. Specifically, we select January 21 for the cold day and July 21 for the hot day. Besides that, we also simulated indoor temperature variations in extreme temperature days when the energy source breaks down. These patterns will be further used to calculate the building resilience and energy burden for specific households in the studied area. 3.3 Residential energy vulnerability profile To profile residential energy vulnerability within a specific community, the proposed method encompasses three critical dimensions: social vulnerability, building environment, and energy burden. For social vulnerability, we refer to the currently widely used social vulnerability index, CDC/ATSDR SVI (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry Social Vulnerability Index). It helps to identify and map the communities that will most likely need support during a disaster. The vulnerable groups here include the elderly, those in poverty, the unemployed, the low-educated, and minorities. In this study, we combined the SVI index with simulated activities of various vulnerable demographic groups. In a previous step, we assigned the probability of these demographic groups to various residential buildings with specific features. Now, in function (7) we multiply this probability by their respective schedules that indicate the probability of being at home. (7) V 1 = ∑ 1 g P i * S i t ( i = 1 , 2 , \u2026 g ) Here, Vulnerability in the Related Building ( P i ) represents the probability of a resident being part of vulnerable group g in a specific building. Home Presence Schedule (Sit) indicates the likelihood of the respective vulnerable group i being at home during specific time slots. By summing all vulnerable groups\u2019 probabilities, this reflects the overall vulnerability dimension for the area where the building is located - Building thermal resilience refers to the ability of a building to prepare for, adapt to, and recover from major disruptions due to extreme weather conditions such as heat waves or power outages (Field, 2012). While there have been several frameworks proposed in the current literature on building thermal resilience measurement, in this paper, we referenced to Flores-Larsen et al. (2023)\u2019s study on passive and free-running buildings where thermal resilience against heat waves can be analyzed from measured data. Therefore, we record the indoor temperature every 15 min with and without an air conditioning system in extreme temperature weather to assess how the building envelope resists the extreme temperature environment. For the dimension of energy burden, based on the energy consumption breakdown in two typical cold and hot months, we calculate the total electric costs and natural gas costs with local utility rates. Then based on the assigned demographic information, we further extract the economic status and calculate the relative energy burden using the following function, which is referenced to Moore & Webb's research on the energy burden calculation method (Moore & Webb, 2022). (8) R e s i d e n t i a l e n e r g y b u r d e n = E l e c t r i c c o s t s + N a t u r a l g a s c o s t s H o u s e h o l d i n c o m e l e v e l With the dimensions of occupancy social vulnerability, building resilience, and energy burden, we can construct a comprehensive profile of household energy vulnerability through the Geographic Information System (GIS) platform, which enables us to not only store and analyze spatial data but also effectively visualize the varying degrees of vulnerability across different areas within a community. For the visualization, we collect the building location information and then create a separate GIS layer for vulnerability assessing results of each dimension. Drawing on the approach proposed by Shach-Pinsly (2019) in their study on urban security visualization, we employ a pixel-based display method to represent the transformed degree of vulnerability within each GIS layer, where each pixel's color intensity corresponds to the level of vulnerability. with lighter colors indicating areas of lower vulnerability and darker colors denoting higher vulnerability. 4 Case study Energy vulnerability is a major issue in Philadelphia where many households struggle to afford consistent energy due to aged housing stock, high poverty rates, and housing burdens (Adams et al., 2022). Based on National Risk Index\u2014an interactive tool developed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) designed to identify communities most susceptible to natural hazards, we applied the proposed method within a specific Census Tract 366 (42,101,036,600) in Philadelphia. Fig. 3 shows the census tract risk distribution in Philadelphia with several areas showing relatively high risk among the whole county. We collect the residential building information of all high-risk census tract areas \u2013 42,101,005,500, 42,101,005,600, 42,101,006,000, 42,101,015,300, and 42,101,036,600 from Zillow Transaction and Assessment Dataset (ZTRAX), which provides the country's largest real estate database with property characteristics across over 2750 U.S. counties. While some tracts are characterized by sparse household distribution (e.g. 42,101,005,600), others show little variation in building features (e.g. 42,101,006,000). Therefore, we selected Census Tract 366 (42,101,036,600) as our primary case study area due to its distinct vulnerability profile and unique building characteristics distribution. 4.1 Data collection and process As of 2020, there are 985 residential buildings in Census Tract 366, with a distribution of 97.26 % being single-family buildings (958). Fig. 4 (a) displays the distribution of the number of buildings by their year of construction. The x-axis represents different years in which buildings were constructed, while the y-axis shows the number of buildings corresponding to each year. The bars reveal notable peaks around 1910 and 2010, which suggests a surge in construction during those years. The color of the bars in Fig. 4(a) corresponds to the geographical distribution of buildings shown in Fig. 4(b), which provides a detailed building distribution in the geographical unit of the census block, the smallest geographic unit used by the United States Census Bureau for data collection and analysis. Each dot on the map represents one building located in the corresponding area, indicating that most households in this area reside near water. Colors in Fig. 4(b) represent the mean construction year within a specific block area, ranging from dark purple for the oldest buildings to light yellow for the newest. It shows that the older buildings are concentrated in certain areas around the highway, reflecting historical development patterns. Given that older buildings may have different energy needs and structural characteristics compared to newer ones, this visual distribution can also be used to infer patterns about infrastructure age, potential energy efficiency, and energy vulnerability. In the process of gathering demographic data for Census Tract 366, Philadelphia County, we take a reference to the CDC's Social Vulnerability Index (SVI). This involved a systematic approach to categorizing populations based on established SVI indicators such as poverty, unemployment, education, age, and minority status. To ensure accuracy and relevance, we sourced our data from the American Community Survey 2020 5-year Estimates Data Profiles. The analysis presented in Table 2 reflects an estimated total population of 2132 individuals within the tract. Notably, the elderly and minority populations represent the most pronounced vulnerable categories, with 20.2 % over the age of 65, and 33.6 % identifying as Hispanic or Latino. Additionally, the tract has a poverty rate of 4.9 %, an unemployment rate of 0.7 %, and a 6.3 % rate of residents without a high school diploma. These figures are critical in pinpointing the subgroups that are potentially at greater risk and will serve as the contextual adjustor in our study. To obtain prior information on the distribution of building features across different demographic groups, we acquired data from the 2020 Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) provided by the US Energy Information Administration. Specifically, we extracted data from the survey detailing household demographic information. Table 3 presents the distribution of building features by demographic groups. The data suggests that vulnerable groups, including those in poverty, the unemployed, and minorities, tend to reside more frequently in multifamily housing units, such as apartments. The building's construction year appears evenly distributed across demographics, though certain groups like the elderly, those in poverty, and those with lower education levels tend to have homes constructed before 1999. Regarding building areas, there's a trend that vulnerable demographics are more likely to live in smaller houses (e.g., nearly half of the low-educated population live in houses smaller than 1000 square feet). This data will serve as prior information in our Bayesian model, which estimates the likelihood of various demographic groups residing in homes with specific features. 4.2 Results and discussion 4.2.1 Bayesian-based mapping results In this research, we employed a Bayesian hierarchical model to analyze the distribution of various demographic groups across diverse building categories within census tract 366. The model was specified and compiled using the stan_model function based on Rstudio. For posterior inference, we utilized the sampling function, which employs the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), an extension of the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) method. We ran three Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) chains, each with 8000 iterations, including an initial warmup of 3000 iterations. To assess the convergence of the model's MCMC chains, we computed the Rhat statistic, also known as the potential scale reduction factor. It measures the ratio of the variance within each chain to the variance between chains. A Rhat value close to 1 indicates good convergence, meaning that the chains have mixed well and are likely sampling from the same posterior distribution. Conversely, a Rhat value substantially greater than 1 suggests that the chains have not converged, indicating potential issues with the MCMC sampling process. In this study, the maximum observed Rhat value was 1.003882, indicating excellent convergence of our model's MCMC chains. figdistributions correlating with diverse building characteristics. Fig. 5 details these distributions, with bar charts representing the proportions of vulnerable populations linked to specific combinations of building features. The majority of distributions reveal a dominance of less vulnerable demographics, characterized by factors such as those not in poverty, the employed, and those with higher education. In contrast, only a minority of distributions show a significant presence of more vulnerable population groups. Furthermore, the final chart in Fig. 5 shows the comparison of aggregated demographic distribution based on the assigned probability in each building in this area and the overall distribution accessed from census data. In this figure, the x-axis represents different demographic groups, while the y-axis represents the proportion of each demographic group within the whole population of the selected area. For this area, the simulated proportions are calculated by aggregating the assigned demographic groups for each residential building to obtain an overall average level (represented by the blue bars). The actual demographic distribution is derived from the American Community Survey (ACS) census data (represented by the red bars). This figure demonstrates a close alignment between the simulated and actual data across all demographic categories, as evidenced by the similar heights of the corresponding blue and red bars. To validate the assigned result, we further categorize the census tract 366 into different geographic areas based on the zip code. The census tract 366 is located in the zipcode area 19,106, 19,123, and 19,147. We collected the proportion of various demographic groups through census statistical data. Then, we compared the proportion of simulated results categorized into different zip code areas with the census data collected and used the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test to examine the comparison results. The p-value associated with this test provides evidence against the null hypothesis, which posits that the two samples originate from the same distribution. Table 4 shows the K-S test results, it appears that the simulated data for all three zip codes is consistent with the real-world data with very high p-vales. Therefore, we can reasonably conclude that the simulated results have been validated against the census data for these zip codes. 4.2.2 Occupancy schedule and energy consumption pattern For different demographic vulnerable groups, we simulated the stay-home schedules using Markov chains based on the American Time Use Survey data. The simulated schedule is shown in Fig. 6 (a) over a 15-minute time interval starting from midnight, segmented by various demographic groups into vulnerable and non-vulnerable (labeled as \"N_\") categories. The probability distribution of various demographic groups staying at home reveals a U-shaped curve that all groups start with a higher propensity to stay home. From midnight onward, the vulnerable groups\u2014Elderly, Minority, Unemployed, Low-Educated, and Poverty\u2014demonstrate a higher likelihood of remaining at home compared to their non-vulnerable counterparts. With the simulated stay-at-home schedule applied in Function (2), we further calculated the adjusted lighting and plug load schedules. Fig. 6(b) shows an example of the adjusted schedule for one day, created from the reference schedule using the simulated household occupancy fraction. The figure shows that when the occupancy is full (1.0), the adjusted schedule has nearly the same value as the reference lighting schedule. When occupancy is relatively low, there is a bigger gap between reference lighting and adjusted lighting, which takes into of the influence of occupancy influence. With the integrated occupancy and building features, we utilized the Department of Energy (DOE) single-family energy prototypes, considering that 97 % of buildings are single-family residential in the study area of census tract 366 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (Table 1 ). For more detailed features of prototypes, we choose single-family, unheated basement, gas furnace heating system prototype. This choice was grounded in its prevalence within the Midwestern region of the United States, as highlighted in previous research (Du et al., 2015). With the prototype and customized building and occupancy information, we then simulated the energy consumption pattern in Climate Zone 4A based on the DOE Climate Zone Categorization. To assess building thermal resilience in the face of extreme temperatures, we simulated and compared the indoor thermal conditions of different residential buildings under two scenarios: with power and without power, during pre-defined typical hot and cold days using EnergyPlus. Fig. 7 depicts indoor temperature trends over 15-minute intervals across two specific days, with a designation ending in \"_X\" indicating a specific building without power. A clear observation is that buildings with power maintain a more stable indoor temperature, irrespective of extreme outdoor conditions. Conversely, buildings without power show that more recently constructed residences tend to retain higher temperatures during cold days and exhibit increased temperatures during hot summer days. This could be attributed to advancements in construction materials and methods over the years. Modern homes often have better insulation and airtightness, which means they can trap heat more effectively. While this is beneficial during cold spells as it reduces the need for heating, it can be a disadvantage during heatwaves, leading to increased indoor temperatures unless cooled down. For energy consumption patterns, we simulated the existing building in the area with a pre-assumed schedule and our simulated schedule of various demographic groups. Fig. 8 presents a comparative analysis of the number of people occupying a given zone at different times, plotted against two different schedules: the predefined and the simulated one. The simulated schedule exhibits a smoother transition in occupancy levels throughout the periods. This pattern may indicate a more gradual arrival and departure of individuals, possibly accounting for a diverse range of activities and occupant schedules. The less abrupt changes suggest that the simulated approach could better accommodate variable lifestyles and work habits within the demographic groups considered. Based on the simulation result, we then collected electricity and gas consumption breakdowns of different buildings across two representative months. For energy prices in Philadelphia County, we take a reference to the data source from the Energy Information Administration for the 2020 Penn Average Price of Electricity to Ultimate Customers (13.15 Cents per Kilowatt hour) and 2020 Pennsylvania Average Price of Natural Gas Delivered to Residential (13.785 dollars per thousand Cubic Feet). Then, we calculated the energy burden of different buildings with the economic status of assigned demographic groups. Combined with location information, the next section will display the geographical distribution of detailed energy burden. 4.2.3 Energy vulnerability visualization To visualize the distribution of social vulnerability, building thermal resilience, and the energy burden among different buildings, we collected the geographic information of each building through Zillow datasets. We aggregated the assigned vulnerable population for all single-family buildings inside each census block and integrated the at-home schedule. Fig. 9 shows the spatial temporal social vulnerability distribution across different census blocks throughout the day. The color block represents the assigned vulnerable population with the variation due to individual mobility. At midnight, the map shows the original distribution of the vulnerability which follows the primary residency of the vulnerable population. As the city awakens at 7am, we notice a slight shift in these patterns, possibly reflecting the morning commute as individuals leave for work, which is further evidenced by the distribution at noon. By 7pm, the vulnerability intensifies in specific areas, likely indicating the return of residents to their homes. These observations underscore a dynamic urban rhythm, where the level of social vulnerability within each block flows with the daily activities of its residents. The persistent high vulnerability in some areas regardless of the time of day highlights the residents may require sustained support and resources. This temporal insight into social vulnerability underscores the need for targeted policy interventions that are responsive to the daily fluctuations in community composition and can be instrumental in planning equitable access to services and infrastructure improvement. For building thermal resilience against extreme hot and cold days, we visualize selected two time periods when the temperature is generally lowest and highest during the day. Fig. 10 shows the indoor temperature distribution based on the building features. We visualized the peak temperatures recorded in the early to mid-afternoon (around 3PM to 5PM) to represent daytime temperatures and the lowest temperatures found before sunrise (around 4AM to 6AM), to represent nighttime temperatures. We normalized the temperature distribution in the period (0,1), where the deeper the color is in the figure, the lower and higher the temperature inside the buildings of the area, respectively for winter and summer. During winter days, the distribution becomes more even, with no extremes in temperature, suggesting effective insulation across most buildings. The winter temperature distribution maps indicate that during both day and night, indoor temperatures are generally low across the region. Combined with the distribution of average building construction year, we can find that areas maintaining higher temperatures such as the left bottom are where more recently constructed buildings are located. Other places with older buildings either display consistently low temperatures or a big difference between day and nighttime. This implies that some buildings may not retain heat as effectively, which could be due to factors like inadequate insulation or poor building materials. This observation is particularly relevant at night when external temperatures drop and buildings without proper insulation or heating capabilities are likely to experience more significant heat loss. However, the summer maps reveal a different pattern; the night temperatures show modest variation, yet the daytime temperatures expose significant hotspots, particularly in the summer day map where red blocks signal areas reaching the upper range of our normalized scale. In accordance with previous building thermal resilience analysis, the buildings that retain higher temperatures in the winter also tend to reach higher temperatures in the summer, which is advantageous for winter heating but poses a risk of overheating in the summer. This pattern underscores the importance of designing buildings with adaptable insulation and ventilation systems that can respond to seasonal changes. Moreover, in the middle of this census tract area, buildings present both vulnerable to extremely low and high temperatures. Indicating these areas have very low building thermal resilience. Overall, these observations suggest that for sustainable urban development, particularly in areas experiencing significant seasonal temperature shifts, there is a pressing need for a dual-focus approach in building design. This approach would simultaneously optimize thermal retention for cold months and enhance passive cooling for warm months. Also, for those areas that present extremely low thermal resilience, there is a need to retrofit buildings and help households better prepare during extreme temperature events. The energy burden map (Fig. 11 ) provides a visual representation of the percentage of household income spent on energy costs within the census tract area. The energy burden levels are classified into three categories Low (< 3.8 %), Medium (3.8 - 6.0%), and High (> 6.0 %), based on the percentage ranges (National Renewable Energy Laboratory, 2024). The map shows a varied distribution of energy burden across the area. Areas with a higher energy burden likely reflect households where a significant portion of income is allocated to energy expenses. This could be due to several factors, including lower household income, less energy-efficient housing, or higher energy rates. According to data from the U.S. Census Bureau as reported by Census Reporter, census tract 366 has a high household income distribution, with a high per capita income of $100,965 and a median household income of $144,659 (Census Reporter, 2023). However, the social vulnerability map, which includes factors such as age, minority status, unemployment, education, and poverty, indicates a correlation with the energy burden distribution. Given age and minority dominate the overall social vulnerability in this area (Table 2 ), the correlation could imply that factors other than income, such as the age or design of the housing stock, the presence of elderly residents who may require more indoor heating or cooling, or cultural practices affecting energy use, play significant roles in energy expenditure. The analysis reveals inconsistent results across different dimensions of energy vulnerability. For instance, area A highlighted in Fig. 11 exhibits a high energy burden yet demonstrates low social vulnerability and moderate building resilience. Conversely, another region in the figure (area B), characterized by a low energy burden, displays varied levels of building resilience and medium social vulnerability. This inconsistency underscores the necessity of a multidimensional approach in assessing energy vulnerability, rather than focusing on a single aspect. Recognizing and addressing these multifaceted dimensions can lead to more effective energy policies. Tailored interventions can be developed that not only address the energy burden but also consider social and infrastructural resilience, ensuring more comprehensive improvement addressing energy vulnerability. Additionally, the observed patterns in each figure vary across seasons (summer and winter) and times of day (night and day), illustrating the dynamic nature of energy vulnerability. This aligns with the findings of previous studies (Simcock et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2023), emphasizing that households and areas currently experiencing low energy vulnerability may transition to a high vulnerability state due to changes in the built environment, weather conditions, and individual mobility. Incorporating this dynamic aspect into energy vulnerability assessments can help to enhance interventions that are not only situationally appropriate but also flexible enough to accommodate seasonal and daily fluctuations. This approach enables more efficient allocation of resources and better preparedness for fluctuating energy demands, ultimately leading to more sustainable and resilient energy systems. Overall, the profile of household energy vulnerability on social vulnerability, building thermal resilience, and energy burden within census tract area 42,101,036,600 provides critical insights for urban sustainability initiatives. The distribution reveals that while the area benefits from a high average income, which typically correlates with lower energy costs and better living conditions, there are still pockets of high social vulnerability and areas with significant energy burdens. These disparities suggest that high average income does not directly correlate with low social vulnerability or energy burden, pointing to the potential influence of other factors such as building age, design, and the specific needs of elderly and minority populations. The findings also highlight the importance of targeted policies that consider the unique characteristics of each community. For buildings with low thermal resilience, there is a clear need for upgrades to improve energy efficiency and reduce the energy burden. This is particularly pressing in regions that experience extreme temperatures, as the current building infrastructure contributes to significant heat loss in the winter and overheating in the summer. By recognizing the interplay between social factors and energy use on households\u2019 energy vulnerability, stakeholders such as urban developers, energy companies, and community organizations can better strategize interventions, leading to a more resilient energy landscape under the changing climatological conditions. 5 Conclusions In this study, we have presented a novel approach to profiling residential energy vulnerability through Bayesian-based spatial mapping and applied the method to a case study in Philadelphia. Our findings highlight the intricate interplay between occupancy characteristics, building features, and energy consumption patterns for energy vulnerability analysis. The application of Bayesian methods has allowed for a better understanding of energy vulnerability at a micro-level, emphasizing the spatial heterogeneity of energy burdens across different urban neighborhoods. The implications of this research are manifold. For policymakers and urban planners, our study offers a valuable tool for identifying areas of high energy vulnerability and tailoring interventions accordingly. This approach can guide more effective allocation of resources towards improving building resilience and energy efficiency, particularly in areas with socio-economically disadvantaged populations. While this approach profiled the dynamic feature of energy vulnerability in both temporal and spatial dimensions, there are still some limitations. First, our analysis was confined to single-family households, which represent 97 % of the residential composition in our study area. However, in regions with a higher prevalence of multi-family residential, future research should aim to integrate both types of housing into a more comprehensive assessment framework. This approach will ensure a more comprehensive understanding of energy vulnerability across diverse residential landscapes. Second, for the assessment of building resilience under extreme weather, we use typical hot and cold days in typical meteorological year during the simulation process. While we recognize that these typical hot and cold days may not fully represent the extreme days as defined, if actual extreme weather conditions can be simulated in the future, the assessment of the building resilience dimension can be improved. Finally, this research aims to present the dynamic energy vulnerability from the three dimensions of social vulnerability, building resilience, and energy burden. It does not analyze their interaction and potential combined influence on final energy vulnerability levels. Future research can explore this topic to provide a more comprehensive understanding of residential energy vulnerability.

        "dc:description": "With global trends in electrification, communities highly dependent on electricity are facing increasing challenges, particularly due to more frequent weather events, which lead to significant surges in electricity demand or result in blackouts. However, the impact is disproportionate across space and time, which raises an urgent need to comprehensively assess residential energy vulnerabilities to ensure energy security for households. Existing methodologies, whether large-scale regional assessments or community-based surveys, predominantly rely on static data. This reliance significantly limits their ability to capture the spatial and temporal dynamics of energy vulnerability, which is particularly important in the face of climate change. This study analyses residential energy vulnerability in the dimensions of social vulnerability, building resilience, and energy burden by innovatively linking occupancy patterns with the built environment through a Bayesian-based spatial mapping methodology. We applied this method through a case study in a Philadelphia census tract area identified for its high vulnerability based on FEMA's National Risk Index. By mapping occupancy with residential buildings, we simulated the energy consumption patterns of approximately 900 residential buildings. The simulations utilized DOE single-family energy prototypes, tailored to account for empirical occupancy and building features, to predict hourly energy consumption and assess indoor thermal comfort during power outages on days with extreme temperatures. The findings reveal disparities across different dimensions of energy vulnerability and illustrate the dynamic nature of energy vulnerability that fluctuates with daily activities. The study also highlights areas with low thermal resilience, suggesting a need for retrofitting older buildings to improve energy efficiency. The implications of this research extend beyond the built environment to the socioeconomic aspects of energy use, advocating for adaptive community planning and the development of resilient energy infrastructures. The results serve as a foundation for stakeholders to implement targeted interventions, prioritize retrofitting efforts, and support equitable access to energy resources, thereby enhancing urban sustainability and resilience.",
