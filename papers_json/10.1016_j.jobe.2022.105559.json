The accuracy of sensor measurement has an important influence on energy efficiency and control characteristics of air conditioning systems. However, the sensor will inevitably have errors due to sensor installation location or aging in the practical system. In previous studies, the sensor virtual in-situ calibration (VIC) method is proposed to diagnose and calibrate sensor faults based on physics-based methods with plenty of sensors. However, the basic sensors are only installed due to the cost and limited installation space in the practical system, which restrains this method. To address this problem, the autoencoder (AE) based on the internal relationship between sensor variables is applied to establish the sensor model to achieve calibration. This paper studies the applicability of the AE that constructs sensor models with limited sensors, and the accuracy of the VIC method under different working conditions. The results show that the AE can well realize the sensor model construction with high accuracy, which lays a foundation for the implementation of the VIC method. Meantime, the accuracy for different scenarios of the single fault is more than 90.75% after calibration, the concurrent fault can also reach more than 88.5%. The supply air temperature calibration will make the continuous regulating valve keep the normal opening to maintain the air volume and ensure the stability of indoor temperature. The static pressure calibration will increase the energy efficiency of the supply fan by 17%, make the VAV box adjust normally, and avoid the disorder of the control loops. The differential pressure sensor calibration will increase the energy efficiency of the water pump by 21%, and ensure normal water flow. Meantime, the calibration of three sensors reduces the time to reach a stable state by more than 20.6%. The VIC method based on AE makes the application scenario of sensor fault calibration more extensive and universal.

The variable air volume (VAV) system has been widely used in many countries and regions due to its energy-saving effect, good thermal comfort, flexible control, and easy expansion [1,2]. The principle of the VAV system is to balance the load change in the air conditioning area by changing the air volume in the room, which can realize the comprehensive control of the thermal and humid environment and air quality of the building. Meantime, various intelligent control strategies are widely used in VAV systems to save more energy, such as supply air temperature control, static pressure control, and differential pressure control before and after the pump [3,4]. However, the normal operation of these control loops must depend on the accuracy of the measurements of temperature, pressure, and differential pressure sensors. If these sensors are wrong, it will reduce the energy efficiency of equipment (e.g., pumps and fans) and possibly even crash the entire control system [5]. The automatic control loops of the VAV system are the key to realizing the energy-saving operation, and this automatic control must rely on the monitoring data of each sensor. According to the different functions, these sensors are mainly divided into monitoring-type and controlling-type sensors [6]. Monitoring-type sensors monitor the physical state of each contact point and are not involved in the control loop of the system. For example, humidity sensors only reflect the humidity of each node in the air system in comfort air conditioning and do not affect the system's operation. These types of sensors can be replaced directly after a fault occurs. In contrast, controlling-type sensors control the actuator adjustment or equipment frequency according to their measurements, such as the supply air temperature sensor, static pressure sensor, and differential pressure sensor before and after the pump. In the basic control loop, the supply air temperature control mainly depends on the difference between the measured value of the supply temperature sensor and the set value to control the opening of the continuous regulating valve. The static pressure control mainly depends on the difference between the measured value of the supply air static pressure sensor and the set value to control the supply fan frequency. The differential pressure control mainly depends on the difference between the measured value of the differential pressure sensor before and after the pump and the set value to control the water pump frequency. These controlling-type sensors fault will directly affect the energy efficiency of the VAV system and reduce the comfort of the room. For example, Lee et al. found that the power consumption of the fan would increase by 26.16% when the positive deviation of the supply air temperature sensor was 4 °C, with the power consumption of the chiller and the pump decreasing by 18.76% and 12.81%, respectively, resulting in extremely poor comfort conditions [7]. Direct replacement will destroy the existing operation of the system and increase and consume considerable human and material resources due to their complex installation environment and their own time involved in the control process. In recent years, many experts and scholars have adopted various methods to diagnose sensor faults in air conditioning systems. In the existing research, sensor fault detection and diagnosis methods are mainly divided into three categories: analytical-based, knowledge-based, and data-driven [8\u201311]. 1) Analytical-based method mainly uses the residual between the measurements and the mathematical model in the operation process to detect and diagnose sensor faults. The large residual shows that the sensor has a fault. When a reasonable range of residual (generated by noise or modelling error) is calculated it shows that the sensor is normal. Papadopoulos et al. proposed a fault diagnosis algorithm based on the distributed model to detect sensor faults in air handling units [12]. Their study obtained the residual signal of the sensor for fault diagnosis by collecting the local control signal and the measurements of the adjacent sensors and got high accuracy. Salsbury et al. proposed a model-based feedforward control scheme, which can detect faults in the controlled process by monitoring the level of feedback compensation [13]. 2) Knowledge-based method is used in large-scale systems for fault detection and diagnosis due to the difficulty in establishing mathematical models or the time-consuming and laborious acquisition of sensor measurements. This method mainly uses expert knowledge or characteristic description of typical faults to establish models. Zhao et al. made full use of all diagnostic information via information fusion and proposed a diagnostic method based on Bayesian Networks (DBNs) to diagnose 28 kinds of component faults, including fans, dampers, pipelines, filters, and sensors [14]. Schein et al. used a set of expert rules derived from mass balance and energy balance to detect the faults of air handling units [15]. Performance evaluation rules can be embedded in commercial building automation and control systems and depend only on the common sensor data and control signals in these systems. 3) Data-driven method is dimensional reduction technology based on multivariate statistics, transforming high-dimensional data into high-sensitive low-dimensional data to diagnose and detect sensor faults and are more suitable for large-scale modern projects with abundant sensors. Du et al. detected sensor measurement faults based on known conditions of the principal component analysis model [16]. The measurement reliability of variables was evaluated combined with two statistics of T 2 and SPE. The fixed and drift error faults of 10 kinds of temperature and pressure sensors were tested, achieving good results. Gao et al. detected the faults of air handling units based on the clustering method, and this strategy can detect single and multiple sensor faults [17]. Although these methods can detect and diagnose various types of sensor faults to some extent, the magnitude of the error cannot be determined. The diagnosed and detected sensor fault without repair still cannot guarantee the safe operation of the building energy system. Therefore, it is necessary to find a method for sensor diagnosis and repair to gain the magnitude of the deviation (systematic error) of various types of sensors without interrupting the normal operation of the existing system. The in-situ calibration method as a sensor self-calibration method has been widely used in the fields of computer science [18,19], chemistry [20,21], etc. [22,23]. The in-situ calibration method can obtain the systematic error of the sensor according to the difference of the datasets before and after calibration to realize the diagnosis and calibration of the sensor. Our group has proposed a virtual in-situ calibration (VIC) method to calibrate various types of sensors in LiBr\u2013H2O absorption refrigeration systems, air handling units, and photovoltaic thermal heat pump systems based on relevant research [24\u201327]. In the calibration process, it is assumed that sensors occur fault, with the distance functions of the sensor model or system model constructed based on energy or mass conservation. Finally, the distance functions are brought into the Bayesian inference to realize calibration. However, there are still some problems in the practical application of the VAV system: 1) The sensors involved in the system control loop are generally installed, while monitoring-type sensors are insufficiently installed, making the model in the distance function unable to be constructed by physics-based method, and the calibration will not be achieved. 2) Although sensor output can be obtained by some machine learning algorithms, other sensors in the calibration domain still need to provide the necessary data in this process, thus increasing calibration difficulty. 3) In the calibration process, the model construction needs high professional knowledge, and the operation is difficult. These problems will become challenges and obstacles to using the VIC method in a practical system. In this study, the autoencoder (AE) was used to construct models that rely on the finite sensor. During model construction, only the sensor input variables and basic AE parameters need to be determined to obtain the model without relying on rich knowledge. AE is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm. Its parameters are continuously adjusted by calculating the error between the output and the original input before the model is finally trained. AE can be used to compress input information and extract useful input features but is different from normal neural networks (input data X to output data Y). It can obtain another representation of the data through the neural network and then restore this representation to the original input data through the neural network (input data X to output data X*). At present, the AE has been used in air conditioning system fault diagnosis and detection. Yan et al. diagnosed various faults of chillers based on Variational Autoencoder- Enabled Generative Adversarial Networks (VAE-GAN) [28]. The results showed that the variational autoencoder-based conditional Wasserstein GAN achieved 16 successes in the classification accuracy in the 24 performance comparisons, verifying the effectiveness and robustness of this method. Cheng et al. proposed a data-driven method based on a deep autoencoder (DAE) to effectively use a large number of unlabelled data to improve fault detection performance and achieve fault separation. The total accuracy of test data was 88.7% by mixing normal data and fault data [29]. Tra et al. proposed a supervised multiclass deep autoencoding Gaussian mixture model (S-DAGMM) algorithm which was an ensemble model of individual unsupervised DAGMMs. The results showed that the proposed methods have more advantages in practical use as the chiller data are easily contaminated by outliers and the cost to obtain labelled fault data is expensive [30]. Thus, AE has its unique advantages in the diagnosis of chiller faults, but there is little research in the field of sensor faults. In this study, the sensor model needed for calibration cannot be established according to the conservation law due to the limited sensors. Therefore, AE will be used to construct the sensor model according to the internal relationship of these sensor variables. The model will not be applicable when a sensor fault occurs and will provide the basis for fault diagnosis. Then, the model with fault measurement is incorporated into the distance function to calibrate the single fault and concurrent fault of different types of sensors, and the error is obtained by the VIC method. In this study, the VIC method based on AE is applied to the practical VAV system to realize the fault detection and online calibration of the sensor participating in the control loop. The sensor models are established by introducing the AE. Next, the models are incorporated into the VIC method to obtain the error of different types of sensors and improve energy efficiency and control characteristics. Section 2 introduces the mathematical principle of the VIC method and AE. To verify the applicability of the VIC method based on AE, the practical VAV system and three basic control loops (supply air temperature control, static pressure control, and differential pressure control before and after the pump) are introduced. The selection, training, and testing of experimental datasets in AE and the setting of different types of sensor errors under different fault conditions are designed. Section 3 introduces the sensor calibration results under the scenarios of single and concurrent faults, the influence of sensor fault on the operation of the actuator, and the energy efficiency of the supply fan and water pump and PID control characteristics. 2 Description of the experimental system 2.1 Methodology 2.1.1 VIC method The VIC method corrects the systematic errors associated with working environments and the random errors from sensor degradation for multiple working sensors in a building system [31\u201333]. This calibration problem is formulated by a distance function (D(x)) with a parameter estimation technique. The definition of D(x) is the key to the calibration in the calculation process, as given by Eq. (1). D(x) is generally obtained by subtracting the correction function (Y c, k ) from the benchmark function (Y b ， k ). The structure of the VAV system is complex, and there are more sensors involved in control. Therefore, it is necessary to add the D(x) of each sensor to obtain the total distance function when calibrating the concurrent faults of multiple sensors. Y c, k is usually composed of the original measurements (M) and offsetting constants (x) of the sensor that generally refers to the sensor deviation (systematic error) after a long operating time, as expressed by Eq. (2). Different types of sensors are interrelated in the operating process, and there are certain constraints between them. Therefore, Y c, k and unknown parameters (x u) of the sensor will construct the Y b ， k through the internal relationship between these sensor variables using AE, as given in Eq. (3). The addition of Y b ， k will further enhance the constraints between sensors and increase calibration accuracy. (1) D ( x ) = ∑ i = 1 I ∑ k = 1 K ( Y c , k − Y b , k ) 2 (2) Y c , k = f 1 ( M , x 1 , x 2 , \u2026 , x k ) (3) Y b , k = f 2 ( Y c 1 , Y c 2 , \u2026 Y c r , x u 1 , x u 2 \u2026 x u q ) where D(x) is the distance function, Y b ， k is the benchmark function, Y c, k is the correction function, k and K are the numbers of sensor calibration terms, i and I are the numbers of datasets, M is the sensor measurement, f 1 is the model of correction function, f 2 is the model of benchmark function, x u is the unknown parameter, x is offsetting constant (variable of VIC). Bayesian inference derives a posterior distribution ( P ( x | Y ) ) of variable (x) including offsetting constant, based on the prior distribution ( π ( x ) ), likelihood function ( P ( Y | x ) ) and normalizing constant ( P ( Y ) ), as expressed in Eq. (4). The sensor error follows a certain distribution; thus, it can be assumed that π ( x ) follows a normal distribution based on relevant theories [34]. The prior mean (systematic error) is set as 0 (there is no systematic error), and the standard deviation is the accuracy of the sensor. D(x) is put into the Gaussian distribution to construct P ( Y | x ) , as given in Eq. (5). When D(x) obtains the minimum value, P ( Y | x ) will obtain the maximum value. P ( x | Y ) will also achieve maximum when π ( x ) is given. As expressed in Eq. (6), P ( Y ) needs to be calculated by integrating P ( Y | x ) and π ( x ) . However, the calculation amount of the numerical integration algorithm will increase exponentially with the increase of the dimension of the variables, and the realization is complex and difficult. Therefore, this study uses Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to solve P ( x | Y ) . Then Metropolis-Hasting algorithm is used to sample from multidimensional normal distribution to obtain the posterior distribution mean [35\u201337]. (4) P ( x | Y ) = P ( Y | x ) × π ( x ) P ( Y ) (5) P ( Y | x ) = 1 σ 2 π exp [ − 1 2 σ 2 D ( x ) ] (6) P ( Y ) = ∫ P ( Y | x ) π ( x ) d x where P ( x | Y ) is the posterior distribution, P ( Y | x ) is the likelihood function, π ( x ) is the prior probability of variable, P ( Y ) is the normalizing constant, σ is the standard deviation. 2.1.2 Autoencoder The VIC method obtains the posterior distribution of sensors based on Bayesian inference. The key of this method lies in the construction of the benchmark function. In the previous research, the benchmark function is the assumption that a large number of sensors are installed and the conservation law is satisfied between the sensors. However, the above situation may not exist in the practical VAV system because of the cost, limited installation space, and noise. These make the construction of the benchmark function become impossible. To address this problem, the autoencoder (AE) based on the internal relationship between sensor variables is applied to establish the benchmark function to achieve calibration. The autoencoder (AE) is composed of an encoder and decoder, and the structure is shown in Fig. 1 . Encoder and decoder are separate neural networks, such as fully connected neural networks, convolutional neural networks, etc. Layer l 1 is the input variable (X) that represents the different types of sensor measurements entered during AE training and testing. Layer l 2 represents the useful potential variables (Z). That is to process the input variables to obtain the dimension reduction representation of data or extract data features, as shown in Eq. (7). Layer l 3 represents the output variable (X*), which is the reconstructed data obtained from the sensor input data after encoding and decoding, as shown in Eq. (8). The training process of the AE uses the random gradient descent algorithm that is similar to the feedforward neural network. It sets the output variable to be equal to the input variable (X = X*). The error between the input variable and output variable is expressed by the cost function ( J ( W , b ) ), as shown in Eq. (9). When the cost function value is small, it shows that the similarity between the input variable and the output variable trained by AE is relatively high, and the accuracy of the model is relatively high. Conversely, it shows that the model accuracy is low and needs to be retrained. (7) Z = g 1 ( b 1 + W 1 X ) (8) X * = g 2 ( b 2 + W 2 Z ) (9) J ( W , b ) = 1 M ∑ m = 1 M ( 1 2 ∥ X * ( m ) − X ( m ) ∥ 2 2 ) where Z is the potential variables, g is the nonlinear transformation function, W is the weight, b is the bias, X is the input variables, X* is the output variables, J ( W , b ) is the cost function, M is the number of samples. However, when the activation function of the neural network is constant, the AE will lose effect and cannot obtain the ideal result. To overcome this problem, some restrictive conditions are added to the existing AE [38]. The sparse autoencoder that is the deformation of the AE can well improve the accuracy of the model under the premise of solving the above problems and its cost function ( J s p a r e ( W , b ) ) is shown in Eq. (10) [39]. The sparse autoencoder with high-dimensional and sparse expression controls the number of activated neurons by adding the sparse parameter ( ρ ). If the neuron output is close to 1, it is considered activated; it is considered limited when the output is close to 0. The sparse autoencoder does not specify which neurons in the hidden layer are suppressed during the computation but specifies ρ to represent the average activity of the hidden layer neurons. (10) J s p a r e ( W , b ) = J ( W , b ) + β ∑ s = 1 S ( ρ log ρ ρ s + log 1 − ρ 1 − ρ s ) where J s p a r e ( W , b ) is the cost function of sparse autoencoder, ρ is the sparse parameter, ρ s is the average activation degree of hidden layer neurons, β is the weight of controlling sparse penalty factor, S is the number of hidden neurons. 2.2 Development of VIC method based on AE The virtual in-situ calibration method based on an autoencoder was developed, the main points of the method were constructing sensor models using AE and solving sensor errors by the VIC method. Then to verify the capability of the method, it was applied in a traditional VAV system to calibrate sensors involved in basic control loops, as shown in Fig. 2 . The calibration process can be divided into the following four stages: 1) Measurements selection stage, 2) AE model training stage, 3) AE model testing stage, and 4) VIC based on AE model stage. The selection of the original measurement will directly affect the accuracy of the AE model. The VAV system will record many historical datasets in the operation process. The measurement datasets under the same stable condition should be selected to ensure the consistency of the error when constructing the AE model and the correction function. Then, the processed experimental datasets are divided into three parts: training datasets, testing datasets, and calibration datasets. The AE model is trained by selecting the optimal parameters in the training process. Next, the testing datasets are incorporated into the AE model, and the model's accuracy is judged by reconstruction error. If the reconstruction error is greater than the threshold, the basic parameters need to be reset. If the reconstruction error is less than the threshold, the benchmark function based on AE and correction function (introducing sensor error) is constructed with the calibration datasets, and then it is brought into the Bayesian inference. The posterior distribution is obtained by sampling, and the error of each sensor is obtained. 2.3 Verification of the system 2.3.1 VAV system The variable air volume (VAV) system was established in Dalian, China, to verify the application of the virtual in-situ calibration method based on an autoencoder. The basic information of the experiment system is shown in Table 1 . The experiment building is a single-story building with three rooms (meeting room, student office room, and office room), as shown in Fig. 3 . The building height is 4 m, the building area is 160 m2, and the air conditioning area is 160 m2. Indoor equipment mainly includes experimental equipment, LED energy-saving lamps, computers, etc. The office room personnel are relatively fixed, meeting room personnel are relatively mobile and numerous. To maintain the comfort of indoor personnel, the air conditioning adopts the VAV system. Different air volumes are transmitted to each independent area by adjusting the terminal device (variable air volume box) so that each room reaches its set value. The VAV system mainly includes a water source heat pump, air handling unit, water pump, water pipeline, ductwork, terminal device, and continuous regulating valve, as shown in Fig. 4 . The total air volume range is 1464\u20134880 m3/h, and the VFD range is 15\u201350 Hz. Meantime, the system is equipped with temperature sensors, pressure sensors, and differential pressure sensors to realize precise control. 2.3.2 Control loop Proportion Integration Differentiation (PID) control is the basic control method with the longest history and the strongest vitality in the development process of automatic control. Although with the development of science and technology, especially the development of computer science and technology, many new control algorithms have emerged. Until now, PID control is still the most widely used basic control method due to its advantages. According to relevant information, 85\u201395% of the control loops are either controlled by PID or based on PID control in continuous industrial control [40]. The main advantages of PID control are 1) Simple principle, easy to use, 2) strong adaptability, and 3) The control quality is not sensitive to the characteristic change of the controlled object. Based on the above analysis, PID is used to control basic loop (supply air temperature control loop, static pressure sensor control loop, and differential pressure control loop) in the VAV system. Note that the terminal device control is generally based on indoor temperature. In the practical VAV system, the indoor temperature sensor is generally wall-mounted. It is convenient to detect, install and replace after the fault, so it is not involved in the sensor calibration. (a) Supply air control loop (C1) The PID controller controls the water flow by adjusting the opening of the continuous regulating valve so that the load of the air handling unit changes with the change of the indoor load to control the supply air temperature at its set value, as shown in Fig. 5 . The PID controller will directly compare the measured value and the set value when the temperature sensor has no fault. When the sensor occurs at fault, it is necessary to bring the fault datasets into the VIC for calibration and then control. The VAV system adopts a PI algorithm to control the supply air temperature, and the relevant parameters are shown in Table 2 . In the control process, the deviation is only 0.53 °C when the supply air temperature is set to 40 °C, and the settling time is 7.17 min. (b) Static pressure control loop (C2) The PID controller controls the static pressure at its set value by adjusting the supply fan frequency, as shown in Fig. 6 . When the static pressure operates normally, the PID controller will calculate the deviation between the measured value and the set value. Conversely, the sensor must be calibrated and then controlled. The VAV system adopts a PI algorithm to control the static pressure, and the relevant parameters are shown in Table 3 . The deviation is only 0.96 Pa when the static pressure is set to 45 Pa, and the settling time is 9.33 min. (c) Differential pressure control loop (C3) The PID controller controls the differential pressure at its set value by adjusting the frequency of the pump, as shown in Fig. 7 . As with the above two controls, the PID controller will control and adjust the water pump frequency by comparing the measured value and the set value when the differential pressure sensor does not fail. However, the differential pressure measurements need deviation compensation that is gained from the VIC method based on AE when the sensor occurs to a fault and is then controlled. As shown in Table 4 , the deviation is only 0.52 kPa when the differential pressure is set to 105 kPa in the control process, and the settling time is 8.17 min. 2.3.3 Selecting and training of experiment datasets The temperature sensor, pressure sensor value, and differential pressure sensor through the acquisition instrument collects a set of data in the operation process of the VAV system. The database will accumulate large amounts of datasets after a long operation. The choice of massive datasets will become a problem that must be solved. Previous studies have shown that the sensor measurements will have different systematic errors under different operating conditions [41,42]. The sensor measurement of different systematic errors must be divided by the clustering method and then calibrated separately to make the error converge to the true value. This paper selects the datasets under the same operating condition for calibration due to the limited extent and focuses on the establishment of the sensor model based on the AE, and no longer discusses other operating conditions. In addition, the essence of Bayesian inference in solving the distance function is to solve the unknowns (offsetting constants and unknown parameters). The calibration can be realized when the number of measured datasets is 3\u20135 times larger than the number of unknowns in the model according to the basic mathematical theorem. Based on the above analysis, this study uses the datasets under winter conditions in stable operation. Meantime, a set of datasets are collected every 10 min for training, testing, and calibration to ensure data diversity. The amount of training, testing, and calibration datasets is 60%, 20%, and 20%, respectively, as shown in Fig. 8 [43\u201345]. Note that the fault dataset mainly comes from sensor aging. After several years of sensor operation, the accuracy of the collected dataset will not be guaranteed. To solve the problem of fault dataset, this method usually pays attention to the dataset at the initial stage of sensor operation. This is because all the sensors are newly installed, and the measurement value of the sensor is fault-free. When the accumulated datasets are used to train the autoencoder, the model will have high accuracy. With the extension of acquisition time, the amount of dataset is gradually increased. The relationship between different sensor inputs is increased, and the robustness and universality of the model are also enhanced. Therefore, this method will collect the dataset for a long time, especially the dataset at the initial stage of sensor operation, so that the autoencoder has a strong fault detection ability. The divided experimental datasets are used in the training and testing of the AE, and the basic parameters are shown in Table 5 . In addition, this study adds the sparsity limitation based on the AE to find out the structure and mode hidden in the input datasets more effectively. The accuracy of the model is further improved by increasing the number of hidden layers and sparse processing. Meantime, the measured values of the temperature sensor, the static pressure sensor, and the differential pressure sensor under the same operating condition are trained and tested to verify the accuracy of the sparse autoencoder model. To quantify the errors between the measurement value and the reconstructed value of the sensor, the root means square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) are used, as shown in Eqs. 11 and 12. The accuracy of reconstructed value is defined as Eq. (13). (11) R M S E = 1 T ∑ t = 1 T ( X t − X t * ) 2 (12) M A P E = 1 T ∑ t = 1 T | X t − X t * | | X t | × 100 (13) a c c u r a c y = 100 − M A P E where T is the number of testing datasets, X t is the tth sensor measurements, X t * is the tth reconstruction value based on AE. The testing dataset results are shown in Fig. 9 . The results show that the original measurement value (circle) and the reconstructed data (line) are coincident, indicating that the accuracy of the sensor model meets the requirements. This paper also introduces the reconstruction error to more intuitively describe the accuracy of the sensor model established. The threshold of reconstruction error is defined using the three-sigma rule, as shown in Eq. 14\u201316 [46]. The accuracy of the model meets the requirements when the reconstruction error is lower than the threshold. Conversely, the accuracy of the model does not meet the requirements, which needs to be remodeled. The above calculation method is used to calculate the reconstruction error threshold of the three types of sensors, and the results are shown in Table 6 . Different types of sensors have different thresholds. Therefore, these three thresholds need to be met simultaneously in the process of building the models to calibrate the sensors. The reconstruction error of the three sensor models is 0.02 °C, 0.04 Pa, and 0.01 kPa, respectively. The reconstruction error is all less than the threshold. This shows that the AE can well realize the transformation from input data to reconstructed data (X to X*) with high accuracy. The accurate sensor model based on the AE can be brought into the distance function to replace the original benchmark function based on the basic conservation conditions (mass conservation, energy conservation, etc.) to realize calibration. (14) T h = X \u203e + 3 σ R (15) X \u203e = 1 J ∑ j = 1 J x j (16) σ R = 1 J − 1 ∑ j = 1 J ( x j − X \u203e ) 2 where Th is the threshold for the reconstruction error, X \u203e is the average reconstruction error of the training datasets, σ R is the standard deviation of the training datasets reconstruction error, and x j is the reconstruction error of the jth data. 2.4 Case of study In the long-running process of the VAV system, the supply air temperature sensor, pressure sensor, and differential pressure sensor not only monitor the operating conditions of the key point but also control the operation of the system, which makes the inevitable sensor error. The three sensors have different types and the control they participate in, which makes them produce different errors. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the sensor accuracy, measurement range, and system control stability when setting the error. First, the sensor accuracy should be considered due to systematic error calibrated in this paper. The accuracy of the temperature sensor, pressure sensor, and differential pressure sensor in the experimental platform is 0.2 °C, 1 Pa, and 2 kPa, respectively. These three sensors will also be this increasing relationship when defining the error. Second, the differential pressure sensor measurement range is the largest, and the temperature sensor measurement range is the smallest from the perspective of the measurement range. This factor should be considered when setting the error. The error of the differential pressure sensor is set to the maximum, and the error of the temperature sensor is set to the minimum. Third, according to the relevant literature, the control stability of the water system is higher than that of the air system. Therefore, the stability of the differential pressure sensor is far greater than that of the temperature and pressure sensor. Based on the above analysis, the temperature sensor error is the smallest relative to the measurement (accounting for 5%), the static pressure sensor error is the largest relative to the measurement (accounting for 10%), and the differential pressure sensor deviation is moderate relative to the measurement (accounting for 8%). In summary, the temperature sensor error is set to +2 °C, the static pressure sensor deviation is set to +5 Pa, and the differential pressure sensor is set to +8 kPa, as shown in Table 7 . The different types of sensors and operating conditions will make the sensor fault time difference in the calibration process. At a certain time, the temperature sensor may occur at a fault, or the pressure sensor occur at a fault, or the differential pressure sensor occur at a fault. This individual sensor fault is called the single fault. The single fault will only affect their control loops for a short time and will not disturb the stable operation of other loops. Furthermore, two or three sensors in the three control loops occur fault simultaneously in most cases due to the complex operating conditions and the internal relation between sensors. These multiple sensor faults are called the concurrent fault. The control loop is ineffective when the concurrent fault occurs, and the energy efficiency of the VAV system reduces. Table 7 specifies the combination of the single and concurrent fault and the size of the error. Different fault conditions need to establish different benchmark functions based on AE to realize the calibration of each operating condition. 3 Results and discussions 3.1 Calibration result of different fault conditions and error According to the division of the above fault conditions, our research group establishes the benchmark function of the sensor based on the AE and then introduced it into VIC for calibration. The calibration results are shown in Fig. 10 . In the figure, (a), (b), and (c) respectively represent the calibration results of the supply air temperature sensor, static pressure sensor, and differential pressure sensor under different fault conditions. The red dotted line represents the sensor systematic error set during calibration. The histogram height represents the error after VIC. The closer the upper end of the histogram is to the red dotted line, the better the calibration results are. Inversely, the calibration does not meet the requirements. It can be seen that the calibration results of different types of sensors under different fault conditions (single fault and concurrent fault) are converged towards the setting value of systematic error. The specific results are shown in Table 8 . The maximum deviations of the supply air temperature sensor, static pressure sensor, and differential pressure sensor after calibration are 11.5%, 2%, and 9.25%, respectively. The sensor systematic error is greatly reduced after calibration, and the original measurement value is closer to the true measured value. However, it also can be seen that the deviation after partial calibration reaches 11.5% in this study. This is because the sensor model is constructed based on the AE rather than the physics-based method, which makes the model have a certain deviation. Moreover, the datasets brought in the distance function are collected by the practical VAV system rather than simulated datasets. The integrity of the data is not as perfect as that of the simulated data due to the existence of noise in the experimental datasets, so the calibration accuracy is reduced. The calibration results of the single fault and concurrent fault of the sensor are different because of the different characteristics of the sensor, and diverse control loops, as shown in Table 8. The supply air temperature sensor (Case1-1), static pressure sensor (Case1-2), and differential pressure sensor (Case1-3) occur fault, respectively (single fault), and the accuracy after calibration reached more than 90.75%. This is because the accuracy of the three sensor models established based on the AE is high. Only when the model is established accurately enough can appropriate samples be obtained in the sampling process. The difference between the correction function and the benchmark function is as small as possible, and the maximum posterior distribution can be ensured. Otherwise, the number of unknowns contained in the single fault function is also small, which makes it easier to find the true value by continuously calculating an unknown number in the multiple sets of data brought into the calibration process. The sensor accuracy can also reach above 88.5% after calibration for concurrent faults (Case2-1, Case2-2, Case2-3, and Case2-4). The number of sensors (two or three) that need to be calibrated increases, which makes the unknowns in the distance function increase, and brings some difficulties to solve the function. However, more sensors will also increase the number of equations of the constructed distance function. The constraints between different sensors are enhanced, and the accuracy of sensor calibration is not reduced. In this study, the VIC method based on AE can realize the calibration of different types of sensors under different fault conditions and obtain the magnitude of sensor error. The calibration accuracy of the single fault can reach more than 90.75%, and the concurrent fault can reach more than 88.5%. 3.2 Influence of sensor errors on actuator and equipment The supply air temperature sensor, static pressure sensor, and differential pressure sensor are the key points of the control loop. Their accuracy is not only related to the normal regulation of the actuator (continuous regulating valve) but also has a great impact on the energy efficiency of the equipment (supply fan and water pump). The PID control is used in the experimental process for the supply air temperature control loop. The PID control is activated at 2 °C above and below the set value (-2\u20132 °C), and the valve opening adjustment range is 30\u2013100% to achieve precise control. The limit of valve opening is set to be more than 30% to prevent the water source heat pump from shutting down due to small water mass flow. The opening of the continuous regulating valve will decrease when the measured value of supply air temperature is higher than the set value. Conversely, the opening increases. The basic principle is to adjust the opening of the continuous regulating valve to ensure that the supply air temperature measurement remains at the set value. Thus, the valve opening will inevitably be affected when the supply air temperature sensor occurs at fault. As shown in Fig. 11 , the valve opening is adjusted when the supply air temperature sensor has a +2 °C error. In the figure, the blue line represents the valve opening with temperature changing under the normal operating condition of the sensor, and the red line represents the valve opening under fault conditions. The supply air temperature set value is comprehensively considered according to the indoor load and outdoor temperature and humidity. The valve opening will slowly decrease when the temperature reaches the set value under the normal condition. Then, the valve opening will gradually increase when the temperature drops to a certain value. This adjustment process meets the basic law of the PID control strategy. However, the +2 °C error of the sensor will make the measured value has been higher than the supply air temperature set value in the fault condition. In this case, the continuous regulating valve will always maintain the minimum opening (30%), and the control process will not be realized. The differential pressure and static pressure measured value directly control the speed (frequency) of the water pump and the supply fan. The water pump and supply fan speed will be adjusted to ensure that the differential pressure or static pressure remains stable. Meantime, their speed and energy consumption correspond according to the instruction book. Videlicet, energy consumption is increased with the water pump or supply fan speed increasing. The energy consumption is also a constant value at a fixed speed. Based on the above analysis, the accuracy of the differential pressure sensor and static pressure sensor is directly related to energy consumption. In Case 2\u20134, the speed of the supply fan increases after the static pressure sensor occurs the error (+5 Pa), and the energy consumption increases, as shown in Fig. 12 . The static pressure sensor measurement is repaired after these fault datasets are calibrated. The error is reduced from +5 kPa to +0.03 kPa, which makes the energy efficiency improve by 17%. Similarly, the water pump speed will increase when the differential pressure sensor occurs fault (+8 kPa), which makes the water pump speed increase. The accuracy of the differential pressure sensor is improved by 96.63% (+8 kPa to +0.27 kPa) after the AE model is brought into VIC. This makes the water pump back to the previous speed, and energy efficiency improve by 21%. The VIC method based on AE can obtain the magnitude of sensor error on the premise of detecting different types of sensor faults, which brings compensation to these sensor measurements and makes energy efficiency improvements. 3.3 Influence on control characteristics Control characteristics are divided into steady characteristics and dynamic characteristics. The steady error is a performance index that describes the steady characteristic of the control loop. The smaller the steady error is, the higher the control loop stability is. The dynamic characteristic of the system provides stability, response speed, and damping, which is described by the dynamic performance index. Dynamic performance indexes include rise time (t r), overshoot, peak time (t p), and settling time (t s). The shorter the three different times, the easier to achieve stability for the control loop and the better the control effect. In this experiment, the VAV system uses the PID control method to control the supply air temperature, static pressure, and differential pressure. To observe the PID response before and after the sensor faults more carefully, the data sampling time is shortened, and the datasets are recorded every 20 s. The measured value is guaranteed to float up and down the set value by adjusting the valve opening or the frequency of the equipment. In this study, the acceptable range error from the set point is 5%. Therefore, the accuracy of these three measured values will have an important impact on the characteristics of the control loop. For the steady characteristics of the control loop, the introduction of the sensor systematic error will make the time to enter the steady state become longer, but the magnitude of the steady error will not change. This is because the measured value of the sensor changes before and after the fault, and the characteristics of the sensor itself do not change. The maximum value achieved by the sensor during the control process will not change, and the measured value can be maintained near the set value after a long time, so the overshoot will not change. However, the rise time, peak time, and settling time will change greatly, as shown in Fig. 13 . The blue curve represents the response curve of the sensor's normal operation, and the red curve represents the response curve after the fault. The ordinate represents the measured values of three different types of sensors, and the abscissa represents the adjustment time of three control loops. The sensors (supply air temperature, static pressure, and differential pressure) have a positive deviation in the operation process, which makes the time of the measured value to the set value prolonged. Videlicet, the rise time is prolonged. In this study, the rise time of the supply air temperature sensor, static pressure sensor, and differential pressure sensor will increase by +3 min, +2 min, and +5 min, respectively, after the sensor fault. In Case 2\u20134, the supply air temperature sensor error changed from +2 °C to +0.09 °C, the static pressure sensor changed from +5 Pa to −0.03 Pa, and the differential pressure sensor changed from +8 kPa to +0.27 kPa after the VIC method based on AE, and the error was greatly reduced. This makes the measurement accuracy of these sensors improve. The control time returned to normal, only increased by +0.17 min, −0.17 min, and +0.67 min, as shown in Table 9 . The peak time and settling time are the time required for the response to exceed its set value to reach the first peak and the time to start the fine-tuning control loop. The prolonging of the rise time will inevitably delay these two times. For example, peak time and settling time increased by +2.5 min due to an increase in rising time of +0.17 min for the supply air temperature sensor, as shown in Fig. 13 (a). In summary, the control characteristics are improved by more than 20.6% after the sensor fault calibration, which ensures the normal operation of the control loop. Response time lag also has a negative impact on the operation of the VAV system in building energy system. The sensor error will make the PID control loop reach a stable time lag, which makes the running time of the supply fan and water pump reach the set value longer. This makes the equipment run at a high frequency for a long time, thus increasing energy consumption. As an important index of indoor comfort, the indoor temperature has a certain lag in the control process. The influencing factors of indoor temperature are supply air temperature and air volume for the VAV system. The response time of the control loop lags after the above three sensors fault (+2 °C, +5 Pa, and +8 kPa). At this time, the supply air temperature and air volume are increased compared with the normal condition, which makes the indoor temperature quickly reach the set value. However, due to the sensor error, the supply fan, water pump, and continuous regulating valve will not be changed after reaching the set value, which will make the indoor temperature rise continuously and increase the energy consumption of the equipment. In addition, even if the real-time adjustment of the VAV box is considered, the sensor error will aggravate the lag of indoor temperature, which will reduce indoor comfort. It can be known the sensor error will make the PID control loop reach a stable time lag, which will bring unnecessary difficulties for the VAV system. The VIC method based on AE can online diagnose and real-time calibrate the sensors of the key points of the control loop so that the sensor measurements remain stable and the control system runs safely. 4 Conclusions In this study, the VIC method based on AE is applied to the practical VAV system to realize the fault detection and online calibration of the sensor. In the case of a few sensors, the AE will construct the benchmark function model according to the internal relationship between sensors without previous requirements based on energy conservation or mass conservation. In addition, this study discusses the influence of sensor fault on the operation of the actuator and the energy efficiency of the supply fan and water pump, and PID control characteristics. The new VIC method is shown to enhance the calibration performance and applicability by overcoming the practical limitations of existing in-situ calibration methods in the VAV system. Detailed conclusions can be drawn as follows: 1) The AE can well realize the transformation from input data to reconstructed data (X to X*) with high accuracy. The reconstruction error of the three sensor models is 0.02 °C, 0.04 Pa, and 0.01 kPa, respectively. 2) The VIC method based on AE can calibrate the single fault and concurrent fault of different types of sensors. The results show that the calibration accuracy of the single fault can reach more than 90.75%, and concurrent fault can reach more than 88.5%. 3) The supply air temperature sensor will make the continuous regulating valve opening normally adjusted according to PID control instead of maintaining the minimum opening after calibration. Meantime, the energy efficiency of the supply fan and water pump will be increased by 17% and 21% after the error compensation obtained for the differential pressure sensor and static pressure sensor. 4) The sensor error will make the control loop reach a stable time lag of more than 20.6%, which will decrease the control characteristics. The VIC method based on AE can calibrate the different types of sensors of the control loop and make the stable time restore to normal. 5) The VIC method based on the AE realize the calibration of different types of sensors (temperature sensor, static pressure sensor, and differential pressure sensor) under different fault conditions (single fault or concurrent fault) and obtain the magnitude of sensor error. This method does not rely on the basic conservation law, lots of sensors, and rich professional knowledge and has high universality and robustness.

        "dc:description": "The accuracy of sensor measurement has an important influence on energy efficiency and control characteristics of air conditioning systems. However, the sensor will inevitably have errors due to sensor installation location or aging in the practical system. In previous studies, the sensor virtual in-situ calibration (VIC) method is proposed to diagnose and calibrate sensor faults based on physics-based methods with plenty of sensors. However, the basic sensors are only installed due to the cost and limited installation space in the practical system, which restrains this method. To address this problem, the autoencoder (AE) based on the internal relationship between sensor variables is applied to establish the sensor model to achieve calibration. This paper studies the applicability of the AE that constructs sensor models with limited sensors, and the accuracy of the VIC method under different working conditions. The results show that the AE can well realize the sensor model construction with high accuracy, which lays a foundation for the implementation of the VIC method. Meantime, the accuracy for different scenarios of the single fault is more than 90.75% after calibration, the concurrent fault can also reach more than 88.5%. The supply air temperature calibration will make the continuous regulating valve keep the normal opening to maintain the air volume and ensure the stability of indoor temperature. The static pressure calibration will increase the energy efficiency of the supply fan by 17%, make the VAV box adjust normally, and avoid the disorder of the control loops. The differential pressure sensor calibration will increase the energy efficiency of the water pump by 21%, and ensure normal water flow. Meantime, the calibration of three sensors reduces the time to reach a stable state by more than 20.6%. The VIC method based on AE makes the application scenario of sensor fault calibration more extensive and universal.",
