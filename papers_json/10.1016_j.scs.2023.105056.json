Department of Building Environment and Energy Engineering The Hong Kong Polytechnic University Kowloon Hong Kong Economizer control is a practical and very important measure to achieve energy savings for air-conditioning systems during moderate seasons. The enthalpy-based economizer control approach is appreciated in Hong Kong due to hot-humid climates, but its performance is often affected by sensor uncertainties. Humidity sensors are especially prone to drift out of calibration, their uncertainties are critical and cannot be ignored. This study quantitatively analysed the impacts of humidity measurement uncertainties on enthalpy-based economizer control and found that they may lead to an increase of up to 35.56 % in the total energy consumption of an air handling unit. An uncertainty-tolerant economizer control strategy is proposed to reduce the impacts. The measured relative humidity of fresh air and return air can be corrected online and used to calculate the fresh air and return air enthalpies. The proposed uncertainty-tolerant economizer control strategy has been validated systematically on a virtual platform. The results showed that the average root-mean-square error of the fresh air and return air enthalpies were reduced by 87.92 and 91.39 %, respectively. Compared with the total energy consumption of the air handling unit using conventional control strategy, it was reduced by 1.02\u201324.58 % when using the uncertainty-tolerant economizer control strategy.

As a major component in the air side of heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, the energy consumed by AHUs is responsible for a significant portion of the total building energy consumption (Najafi et al., 2012). Most AHU systems are equipped with many variable air volume (VAV) terminals for achieving higher energy efficiency, because VAV air conditioning systems require less energy for fan operation compared with constant air volume (CAV) air conditioning systems (Delwati et al., 2018, Aktacir et al., 2006). The energy performance of AHU-VAV systems can further be enhanced using some advanced control strategies, for example, duct static pressure reset control strategy (Li et al., 2019), supply air temperature reset control strategy (Fang et al., 2022), demand-controlled ventilation control strategy (Lu et al., 2022), etc. Apart from the methods mentioned above, air-side economizers are often employed to reduce the energy consumption of AHU systems in mild climates, which is a very popular and effective energy conservation measure for HVAC systems. An economizer utilizes free cooling to replace mechanical cooling completely or partially. Son and Lee (Son and Lee, 2016) achieved an energy saving of about 10 % in Korea by using an economizer with differential enthalpy control. Tom et al. (Ben-David et al., 2017) developed a series of ventilation strategies for offices and found that the strategies which involve an economizer can not only save energy but also enhance work performance. In addition, air-side economizers can also be used to reduce the cooling energy consumption in data centres (Ni and Bai, 2017). The control decisions of air-side economizers can be made based on the enthalpies or dry-bulb temperatures of fresh air and return air, depending on the climate conditions. The enthalpy of moist air cannot be measured directly but can be calculated based on its measured dry-bulb temperature and relative humidity. The measurement uncertainties in temperature and humidity sensors affect the performance of enthalpy-based control approaches significantly, and lead to the performance downgrade of air-side economizers (Dave Moser, 2013). In fact, temperature sensors are very stable and their accuracy can generally be maintained at an acceptable level over a long period, but relative humidity sensors are difficult to maintain accuracy, they even cannot meet the accuracy levels described in specifications (Taylor and Cheng, 2010). The accuracy of relative humidity sensors claimed by manufacturers is generally ± 1\u20133 % (Feng et al., 2007), but the sensor errors are highly dependent on the sensor quality and calibration frequency in real applications, it would even be more than ± 24 % for a worst sensor (Taylor and Cheng, 2010). In addition, relative humidity has a larger spatial variability than temperature, which leads to more significant uncertainty (Hempel et al., 2018). Frequently failure of humidity sensors often leads users to give up the usage of enthalpy-based control approaches and switch to dry-bulb temperature-based control approaches (Hong and Kim, 2021). It is a big challenge to deal with the measurement uncertainties. The most direct and effective solution is field sensor calibration. Generally, the sensors should be calibrated periodically because their accuracy may degrade with service time. A calibration interval of one year is recommended for most sensors (ASHRAE, 2014). But field sensor calibration is not a compulsory measure in Hong Kong and its implementation is constrained by site conditions and costs. Many sensors are out of calibration and in unhealthy conditions. Due to the limitations of field sensor calibration, many indirect methods are proposed to address measurement uncertainties of sensors in recent decades (e.g., fault-tolerant control, sensor fault detection). The aim of fault-tolerant control methods is to make the control systems tolerate a certain level of measurement uncertainties and improve their robustness. Yang et al. (2014) proposed a fault-tolerant control strategy for an air conditioning system. The faulty measurements were corrected with a final correcting factor, enabling the strategy to be able to tolerate both bias and drift faults of a temperature sensor. Fault detection methods aim to find the sensor faults and make it possible to calibrate, repair or replace the faulty sensors in time. Yan et al. (2022) proposed a Decentralized Boltzmann-machine-based fault diagnosis method to detect bias and drift faults of three temperature sensors and a flow meter in an AHU. Zhu et al. (2012) detected the bias and drift faults of 4 temperature sensors, 4 flow meters and 1 pressure sensor using a neural network pre-processed by wavelet and fractal. Although these methods perform well in their respective fields, their flexibility and generalization ability are very poor. In addition, most of the existing studies focused on detecting/addressing the faults in temperature sensors and flow meters in HVAC systems, while the studies on fault detection of humidity sensors are still rare in the literature. In order to deal with measurement uncertainties, a virtual in-situ sensor calibration method is proposed by Yu and Li (2015) and extended by Yoon and Yu (2017), where Bayesian inference and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling methods are used. This method shows good performance on sensor calibration. For example, Zhao et al. (2022) used this method to calibrate the sensors (temperature and humidity sensors, flow meter, etc) in an AHU and the results showed that the accuracy of the sensors concerned was improved by 75 %. Wang et al. (2021) reduced the systematic and random errors of the sensors concerned by approximately 95 and 60 % on average, respectively. But the method requires a system model and reliable data which are often unavailable or difficult to obtain in practice. The authors of this paper also made efforts to online sensor calibration using Bayesian inference and MCMC sampling methods. For example, a physical model-based measurement uncertainty quantification method was proposed, where the measurement uncertainties were quantified online using the historical system operation data (Sun et al., 2022). This method is further used to optimize the total cooling load-based chiller sequencing control, where the cooling load measurements were corrected in real-time (Sun et al., 2022). The implementation of this method is based on physical models (e.g., energy balance models), which means that the method is not applicable to cases where the physical models are unavailable. Data-driven models were proposed to replace physical models to overcome this limitation (Sun et al., 2023). Many advanced algorithms were used to develop data-driven models, such as multiple linear regression (Fan et al., 2019), artificial neural network (Biswas et al., 2016), and support vector machine (Shao et al., 2020). Apart from the data-driven models, Bayesian inference and MCMC sampling methods also play an important role in inverse uncertainty quantification. They have been widely used in quantifying unknown parameters in building energy models (Tian et al., 2018). The parameters that are unavailable or difficult to measure/estimate can be quantified effectively, such as U-values of the building envelope (Yi et al., 2019), and internal loads from the equipment, lighting and occupants (Yi and Park, 2021). These studies confirmed the strong ability of Bayesian inference and MCMC sampling methods on uncertainty quantification. It is possible to address measurement uncertainties directly using Bayesian inference and MCMC sampling methods based on data-driven models. This study aims to deal with the measurement uncertainties of humidity sensors and optimize the enthalpy-based economizer control for enhancing the reliability and energy performance of AHUs. Firstly, the impacts of humidity measurement uncertainties on enthalpy-based economizer control are evaluated. Then an uncertainty-tolerant economizer control strategy is proposed to reduce the impacts. Based on a data-driven model, the humidity measurements are corrected online using Bayesian inference and MCMC sampling methods. The enthalpies of fresh air and return air are calculated using the corrected humidity measurements and used for control decision-making. The main contribution of this study is to online correct the humidity measurements with significant uncertainties and dramatically reduce the impacts of humidity measurement uncertainties on enthalpy-based economizer control for AHUs. The service life of humidity sensors can be extended significantly, and the operation and maintenance costs can be reduced. 2 Enthalpy-based economizer control of AHUs The air (fresh air and return air) is conditioned by the AHU and supplied to indoor spaces to fulfil the space ventilation and cooling requirements (ASHRAE, 2020). Fig. 1 shows the schematic diagram of an AHU. It mainly consists of a filter, a cooling coil, a supply air fan, a return air fan, and air dampers. The air dampers are modulated to control the quantities of fresh air (FA) and return air (RA) for maintaining indoor air quality and thermal comfort. The fans are equipped with variable speed drives (VSDs) and their frequency is regulated to control the supply and return air flow rates according to the space cooling demand. Fig. 1 also shows the enthalpy-based economizer control, where the temperature and humidity of fresh air and return air are measured for estimating their enthalpies. Economizer control of an AHU is critical to the air quality of conditioned space(s). Furthermore, in the transition season, the energy consumption of mechanical cooling can be reduced by using the cooling of fresh air as much as possible. Generally, the fresh air quantity is modulated according to air dry-bulb temperatures and/or enthalpies condition. The dry-bulb temperature-based economizer control approach applies to the regions with dry climates, while the enthalpy-based economizer control approach applies to the regions with hot-humid climates (Yao and Wang, 2010). In Hong Kong, the enthalpy-based economizer control approach is appreciated because of the hot-humid weather conditions. Fig. 2 shows the enthalpy-based operating sequencing of an AHU in cooling seasons. It is implemented by comparing the enthalpies of fresh air (hFA ) and return air (hRA ). If the fresh air enthalpy is small enough, which can meet the cooling demand or it is more economical to cool fresh air than cool return air, the fresh air will be used as much as possible for energy-saving. Otherwise, the fresh air ratio is adjusted to the minimum for maintaining indoor air quality and saving energy. The air dampers in Fig. 1 are adjusted to change fresh and return air ratios according to the rules in Fig. 2. There are three cooling modes which are described in detail as follows: (1) Total free cooling mode: Fresh air enthalpy is smaller than return air enthalpy. The indoor space is totally cooled by fresh air, and no mechanical cooling is required. (2) Partial free cooling mode: Fresh air enthalpy is also smaller than return air enthalpy. Fresh air is also used to cool the indoor space, but the amount of fresh air is not sufficient to meet the cooling demand. Mechanical cooling is therefore required. (3) Mechanical cooling mode: Fresh air enthalpy is greater than return air enthalpy. Fresh air is modulated only to maintain indoor air quality, and return air is recycled. Fresh air enthalpy (hFA ) and return air enthalpy (hRA ) are calculated from their dry-bulb temperatures (TFA, TRA ) and relative humidity (φFA, φRA ). Corresponding temperature and humidity sensors should be installed, as shown in Fig. 1. According to the 2021 ASHRAE Handbook \u2013 Fundamentals (ASHRAE, 2021), the enthalpy of moist air (h, kJ/kg) can be calculated by Eq. (1). (1) h = 1 . 006 · T + d · ( 2501 + 1.86 · T ) where T is the dry-bulb air temperature (°C), and d is the humidity ratio of the moist air (kg w /kg a ). The humidity ratio can be calculated by Eq. (2). (2) d = 0 . 621 945 φ · p s p − φ · p s where φ is the relative humidity of the moist air, p is the atmospheric pressure (Pa), and ps is the corrected saturation water vapor pressure (Pa). The corrected saturation water vapor pressure can be estimated by Eq. (3), which is developed by Buck (1996). (3) p s = 611.2 · e ( 18.678 − T / 234.5 ) · T T + 257.14 3 Impact evaluation of humidity measurement uncertainties on enthalpy-based economizer control As mentioned previously, humidity sensors are more likely to suffer from significant uncertainties. This section focuses on evaluating the impacts of humidity measurement uncertainties on enthalpy-based economizer control. 3.1 Characteristics of humidity measurement uncertainty Due to the existence of measurement uncertainties, the measured humidity ( φ ˜ ) consists of two parts: the true value (φ) and an uncertain term (u), as denoted by Eq. (4). It is impossible to get the true value in practical applications. A standard measurement uncertainty is expressed as a standard deviation, it is evaluated generally by the statistical analysis of series of observations (ISO/IEC, 2008). In this study, sensor bias is merged with the standard uncertainty. Therefore, the uncertain term is assumed to follow a normal distribution, as shown in Eq. (5). Its mean value (μ) is the systematic uncertainty, and its standard deviation (sd, σ) represents the random uncertainty. According to the characteristics of normal distributions, the measured humidity would also follow a normal distribution with mean (φ + μ) and standard deviation σ, as shown in Eq. (6), and it is presented graphically in Fig. 3 . The distribution parameters (systematic and random uncertainties) are assumed to be fixed over a period of time in this study. (4) φ ˜ = φ + u (5) u ∼ N ( μ , σ 2 ) (6) φ ˜ ∼ N ( φ + μ , σ 2 ) 3.2 Description of the test system and the virtual platform A virtual building system with an AHU is developed using TRNSYS, and the enthalpy-based economizer controller is programmed using Python. As shown in Fig. 4 , the measurement uncertainties are introduced artificially. The simulated humidity measurements (φFA,mea and φRA,mea ) are equal to the sum of the simulation humidity outputs (φFA and φRA ) and the introduced uncertainties. The measured humidity and the air temperatures (TFA and TRA ) are used to calculate the air enthalpies (hFA,mea and hRA,mea ). Then the control decisions are made according to the air enthalpies. And the control signals, including the cooling mode and air ratios, are sent to the AHU. The fresh air damper is controlled to modulate the fresh air flow rate according to the control decisions. The energy performance of the AHU was evaluated considering measurement uncertainties. The cooling load of the air-conditioned space is simulated by a TRNSYS component (Type 88), which is a single-zone building model with lumped capacitance. The cooling coil of the AHU is simulated by Type 752. The fan (variable speed) is modelled by Type 147, and the air enthalpy is calculated by Type 33 based on its temperature and humidity. Type 169 is used to connect Python to TRNSYS. Table 1 shows the main parameters of the developed virtual system, including the thermodynamic parameters and area of the building, the heat gains from lighting, equipment and occupants, the rated fan power, and the overall coefficient of performance (COP) of the cooling system. The building is a large-scale office room. The building thermal parameters and the physical property parameters of building air are set by default in TRNSYS. The occupant density and the lighting, equipment and occupancy loads are determined by referring ASHRAE handbooks (ASHRAE, 2021; ASHRAE, 2019). In addition, it should be noted that the overall COP of the cooling system is assumed to be a constant in this study, i.e., 2.5 (Zhuang and Wang, 2020). 3.3 Test arrangements for the evaluation Four cases with different levels of measurement uncertainties are used to systematically evaluate the impacts of humidity measurement uncertainties on enthalpy-based economizer control. The measurement uncertainties of relative humidity sensors in each case are introduced artificially. They are generated randomly based on the distribution parameters (i.e., mean value and standard deviation) of a given normal distribution, as shown in Table 2 . A reference case without introducing uncertainties was used as a benchmark. The main difference between the other four cases is the plus-minus signs of systematic uncertainties. A positive systematic uncertainty tends to make the measured humidity greater than the true value. On the contrary, a negative systematic uncertainty tends to make the measured humidity less than the true value. These four cases cover all the possible scenarios in real applications. The magnitudes of uncertainties introduced are determined based on expert knowledge and experience. As mentioned in Section 1, the accuracy of relative humidity sensors is generally ± 1\u20133 %, which is an acceptable level of uncertainty. In engineering practice, it is easier to detect a humidity sensor with high uncertainty, but the humidity sensor with low or medium uncertainty is not easily perceived. Hence, the systematic uncertainties of fresh air and return air humidity sensors are set to ± 8 % and ± 6 % respectively in this study. The AHU system was simulated on a typical day. Fig. 5 presents the relative humidity, dry-bulb temperature and enthalpy of the fresh air. The fresh air is suitable for cooling the indoor space due to relatively low enthalpies, the economizer can be triggered normally under such fresh air conditions. Therefore, it could be used to evaluate the performance of enthalpy-based economizer control in this study. The simulation time step is 10 seconds. The time interval of the data collection and control decision-making is 5 minutes. 3.4 Evaluation results and analysis Table 3 shows the energy performance of the AHU system in each case. Compared with the reference case, the energy performance of other cases declines due to the existence of measurement uncertainties. In Case 1, the cooling energy consumption increases a little and the fan energy consumption is reduced slightly, but the total energy consumption increases by 3.64 %. In Case 2, the cooling energy consumption increases significantly (more than twice the benchmark), and the fan energy consumption is reduced a little. It leads to a significant increment of 35.56 % in total energy consumption. In Case 3, though the cooling energy consumption is reduced dramatically, the fan energy consumption increases significantly, resulting in the total energy consumption increasing by 17.95 %. In Case 4, the cooling energy consumption is reduced moderately, while the fan energy consumption increases significantly. The total energy consumption is increased by 29.66 %. Therefore, it can be concluded that the measurement uncertainties can affect the performance of enthalpy-based economizer control significantly and further decline the energy performance of AHU systems. The impacts cannot be ignored and should be addressed. The increments in energy consumption caused by the measurement uncertainties are different in different cases, which is possibly related to the directions (plus-minus signs) of the introduced uncertainties. The uncertainties in Case 1 make the measured enthalpies of both fresh air and return air greater than their actual enthalpies. The impact is small as the results are often consistent when comparing the magnitudes of their measured or actual enthalpies. The uncertainties in Case 2 make the measured fresh air enthalpy greater than its actual enthalpy and the measured return air enthalpy less than its actual enthalpy, the AHU tends to operate under Mode 2 or 3, resulting in a significant increase in cooling energy consumption. On the contrary, the uncertainties in Case 3 make the measured fresh air enthalpy less than its actual enthalpy and the measured return air enthalpy greater than its actual enthalpy, the AHU tends to operate under Mode 1, leading to a significant decrease in cooling energy consumption, but the fan energy consumption increases dramatically as more fresh air is needed to meet the cooling demand. The uncertainties in Case 4 make the measured enthalpies of both fresh air and return air less than their actual enthalpies. Possibly due to the influence of systematic uncertainties, the AHU tends to operate under Mode 1 or 2, causing an increase in fan energy consumption. 4 Uncertainty-tolerant economizer control strategy In order to optimize the enthalpy-based economizer control and improve the energy performance of AHUs, an uncertainty-tolerant economizer control strategy is proposed, where a data-driven model-based method is used to deal with the humidity uncertainties. This method can quantify measurement uncertainties accurately according to our previous work (Sun et al., 2023). Generally, the indoor air temperature, the temperatures and relative humidity of return air and supply air are measured for normal operation of AHUs. The temperature and relative humidity of return air are almost the same as those of the indoor air without considering the heat transfer in the air duct. Generally, an effective controller (for example, a feedback controller) makes the indoor air temperature always fluctuate around its setpoint. It means that the return air temperature is almost fixed. The return air temperature cannot take any effect to quantify the uncertainties of humidity measurements. Hence, it will be not used to develop the data-driven model. The aim of the proposed uncertainty-tolerant economizer control strategy is to online correct the relative humidity measurements of fresh air and return air, and further they are used to calculate the enthalpies. The relative humidity of fresh air and return air are the target variables to be corrected, and the power consumption of the supply fan and the fresh air temperature are the auxiliary variables for model development. 4.1 Outline of the proposed uncertainty-tolerant economizer control strategy Fig. 6 shows the outline of the proposed uncertainty-tolerant economizer control strategy for AHUs. A data-driven benchmark model should be developed firstly using the normal operation data. It is the foundation of the proposed control strategy. Then the real-time humidity measurements are corrected online based on the developed benchmark model, where the distribution parameters of the uncertainties concerned (i.e., fresh air and return air humidity sensors) are needed and they can be obtained by online uncertainty quantification or field sensor calibration, etc. Finally, the enthalpies of fresh air (hFA , cor ) and return air (hRA , cor ) are calculated based on the corrected humidity and used to make control decisions. Similarly, the proposed uncertainty-tolerant economizer control strategy is also validated on the TRNSYS-Python co-simulation platform, as shown in Fig. 7 . Compared with the system developed in Fig. 4, an additional component is added and used to online correct the relative humidity measurements, where the supply fan power consumption (Pfan ) is used. The distribution parameters are an external input of this component. The corrected humidity measurements (φFA,cor and φRA,cor ) are used to calculate the air enthalpies. The corrected enthalpies (hFA,cor and hRA,cor ) are used to make control decisions and the control signals are sent to the AHU. More details are presented in the following sections. 4.2 Benchmark model development A multiple quadratic regression model is adopted as the benchmark model in this study. The fan power consumption (Pfan ) is the dependent variable as it would vary with the building cooling load and weather conditions. The independent variables include the dry-bulb temperature (TFA ) and relative humidity (φFA ) of fresh air and the relative humidity of return air (φRA ). The model is denoted by Eq. (7). An error term ( e ) accompanying the model cannot be ignored, it generally follows a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation δ. The coefficients of the model (c 1-7) and the standard deviation of the model error (δ) can be determined by using normal operation data to train the model. (7) P f a n = f ( T F A , φ F A , φ R A ) + e = c 1 T F A 2 + c 2 φ F A 2 + c 3 φ R A 2 + c 4 T F A + c 5 φ T F A + c 6 φ F A + c 7 + e , e ∼ N ( 0 , δ 2 ) The model is trained by the simulation data of the reference case, where no measurement uncertainties are introduced. The ordinary least squares method is adopted. After the training, the model is developed with an R 2 of 0.98, showing that the data fit the model well. These coefficients (including the standard deviation of the model error, which is replaced by the standard deviation of model residuals) are presented in Table 4 . The data is not normalized in model training process for avoiding anti-normalization and reducing the calculation load. For a multiple quadratic regression model, the model performance is not affected by the data dimensions, only the coefficients will change when using normalized data. 4.3 Online correction of relative humidity measurements and enthalpies This study adopts Bayesian inference and Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling methods to deal with the measurement uncertainties of humidity sensors. The details about the methods are as follows. Bayesian inference: Bayesian inference aims to compute the posterior distributions of unknown parameters using prior distributions, likelihood functions and observation data (Hou et al., 2021). The mathematical formulation is stated as Eq. (8), which is called Bayes\u2019 theorem. Where, θ is the unknown parameters to be estimated, D is the observation data, P ( θ | D ) is the posterior distributions, P ( D | θ ) is the likelihood functions (compatibility with the observation data), P ( θ ) is the prior distributions (inherent likeliness), and P ( D ) is the marginal likelihood. The posterior probability is only affected by the prior probability and likelihoods, it is proportional to the product of the prior probability and the likelihoods. (8) P ( θ | D ) = P ( D | θ ) · P ( θ ) P ( D ) ∝ P ( D | θ ) · P ( θ ) Markov chain Monte Carlo: Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling methods can be used to draw samples randomly from high-dimensional probability distributions (Tian et al., 2016), which greatly promotes the applications of Bayesian inference. The Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) method is one of the most commonly used MCMC algorithms as it can avoid random walk behaviour and is insensitive to correlated parameters (Chong and Menberg, 2018). But the HMC method is sensitive to the leapfrog step size and the number of leapfrog steps per iteration. In order to cover the shortage, a new MCMC algorithm, named as No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), was proposed by Hoffman and Gelman, it is an extension of the HMC method (Hoffman and Gelman, 2014). NUTS can search for the number of leapfrog steps automatically and adapt the leapfrog step size, its performance is at least as well as the HMC method. Therefore, this study uses NUTS to generate samples and infer the posterior distributions of the unknown parameters concerned in Bayesian models. Based on the developed data-driven model, the real-time relative humidity measurements are corrected using Bayesian inference and No-U-Turn Sampler. The Bayesian models are presented by Eq. (9), where only the actual relative humidity of fresh air (φFA,t ) and return air (φRA,t ) are unknown and need to be estimated. (9) { P f a n , t ∼ N ( − 0.0592 T F A , t 2 + 0.0017 φ F A , t 2 + 0.0913 φ R A , t 2 + 2.3713 T F A , t − 0.2284 φ F A , t − 3.932 φ R A , t + 31.2957 , 0.1637 2 ) φ ˜ F a , t ∼ N ( φ F A , t + μ F A , σ R A 2 ) φ ˜ R a , t ∼ N ( φ R A , t + μ R A , σ R A 2 ) The Bayesian models in this study are coded using the stan programming language. The range of relative humidity is between 0 and 100. Therefore, a uniform distribution is used as the prior distribution of the relative humidity, as shown in Fig. 8 . The posterior distributions of the fresh air and return air humidity are obtained. Their mean values are regarded as their corrected values and used to calculate/correct the enthalpies of fresh air and return air. Then the control decisions are made based on the corrected enthalpies. 5 Performance evaluation and test results of the uncertainty-tolerant economizer control The proposed uncertainty-tolerant economizer control strategy was tested using the cases presented in Section 3.3. This control strategy was implemented in each case (other than the reference Case) and the test results are presented in this section. The performance of the proposed uncertainty-tolerant economizer control strategy was evaluated by comparing the energy performance of the AHU. 5.1 Comparison of the measured enthalpies and corrected enthalpies Figs. 9\u201312 show the enthalpies of fresh air and return air in each case on the test day, including the actual values (i.e., simulation output), corrected values (i.e., posterior mean), measured values and 95 % Bayesian credible intervals. As can be seen from these figures, the measured enthalpies deviate from their actual values obviously due to measurement uncertainties of relative humidity, the errors caused are significant. Positive systematic uncertainties tend to cause the measured values to be greater than the actual values, such as the fresh air enthalpy in Cases 1 and 2, the return air enthalpy in Cases 1 and 3. On the contrary, negative systematic uncertainties tend to cause the measured values to be less than the actual values, such as the fresh air enthalpy in Cases 3 and 4, the return air enthalpy in Cases 2 and 4. Fortunately, the corrected enthalpies are very close to their actual values. Almost all the actual values are located within their 95 % Bayesian credible intervals. In addition, the 95 % Bayesian credible intervals are relatively narrow, which indicates high reliability. The root-mean-square errors (RMSE) of the measured and corrected enthalpies are also calculated for conducting quantitative analysis, as shown in Table 5 . The RMSE of measured enthalpy in each case is much greater than that of corrected enthalpy. Compared with the measured enthalpies, the average RMSE of the fresh air enthalpy is reduced by 87.87 % (from 2.3190 kJ/kg to 0.2813 kJ/kg) after correction, and the average RMSE of return air enthalpy is reduced by 91.39 % (from 3.1091 kJ/kg to 0.2678 kJ/kg) after correction. The accuracy of the corrected enthalpy is enhanced significantly and is fully acceptable in real applications. 5.2 Energy performance of the AHU using the proposed control strategy Fig. 13 compares the total energy consumption of the AHU using conventional and proposed economizer control strategies. Compared with the energy consumption of the AHU using the conventional economizer control strategy, its energy consumption using the proposed economizer control strategy was reduced significantly by 1.02\u201324.58 %. It can be concluded that the proposed uncertainty-tolerant economizer control strategy could significantly reduce the impacts of humidity measurement uncertainties. 5.3 Discussion The proposed uncertainty-tolerant economizer control strategy is tested only on a typical day in this study. This is because economizer control will only be triggered under certain weather conditions, such as mild climate. It does not take any effect under improper weather conditions, such as in the height of summer. The proposed control strategy can be tested over a long time, such as a year, but it may be meaningless at most of the time as the economizer control is not triggered. Therefore, it is reasonable to test the proposed control strategy on a typical day. The data-driven model is the core of the proposed uncertainty-tolerant economizer control strategy, it determines whether the humidity measurements can be corrected accurately or not. If the data-driven model is unreliable, the expected performance of the proposed control strategy cannot be achieved. Hence, the data used to develop the model should be reliable enough. Generally, the data collected after initial commissioning is preferred, because the sensors' accuracies are high, and the uncertainties are small and acceptable. Alternatively, the model/data can be provided by the sensor manufacturers. The measurement uncertainties of the humidity sensors may change over time due to performance degradation. The distribution parameters in the Bayesian model (i.e., Eq. (9)) should be updated periodically to be adaptive to such change. The update interval can be set flexibly according to the actual requirement. With the proposed uncertainty-tolerant economizer control strategy, the impacts of humidity measurement uncertainties can be reduced significantly and energy-savings can be achieved. The humidity sensors with significant uncertainties can still be used. The service life of the humidity sensors can be extended significantly, and the maintenance costs can be reduced. Though the humidity measurement uncertainties can be solved using the proposed control strategy in this study, it gives a challenge to calculation capacity of controllers as the calculation load is generally high when solving Bayesian models. This issue should be addressed. Otherwise, the applications of the proposed control strategy may be limited. 6 Conclusions This study quantitatively analysed the impacts of humidity measurement uncertainties on enthalpy-based economizer control of AHUs. To reduce the impacts, an uncertainty-tolerant economizer control strategy was proposed. Based on a data-driven model, the measured relative humidity of fresh air and return air is corrected online using Bayesian inference and Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling methods. The corrected humidity of fresh air and return air are used to calculate/correct their enthalpies. The control decisions are made based on the corrected enthalpies of fresh air and return air. The proposed economizer control strategy has been validated systematically on a virtual platform. The main conclusions are as follows. \u2022 The performance of enthalpy-based economizer control was affected heavily by the measurement uncertainties of relative humidity sensors (fresh air and return air). It may lead to an increase of up to 35.56% in the total energy consumption of the AHU. \u2022 The measured enthalpies of fresh air and return air deviate from their actual values due to the uncertainties of relative humidity measurements. The deviations can be reduced by online correcting the relative humidity measurements using a data-driven method. Compared with the measured enthalpies, the average RMSEs of the fresh air enthalpy and return air enthalpy were reduced by 87.87 and 91.39 % respectively after correction. \u2022 The proposed uncertainty-tolerant economizer control strategy can significantly reduce the impacts of measurement uncertainties of relative humidity sensors. Compared with the total energy consumption using the conventional economizer control strategy, the total energy consumption of the AHU was reduced by 1.02\u201324.58 % when using the proposed control strategy. As the core of the proposed uncertainty-tolerant economizer control strategy, the data-driven model in this study is a multiple quadratic regression model and is developed using the ordinary least squares method. Its effectiveness has been validated in this study. The algorithms, such as support vector machine and artificial neural network, can also be used to develop data-driven regression models. It is worthy of study whether these models can be used to correct the humidity measurements and whether a better performance can be achieved. In addition, as an inherent feature of sensors, measurement uncertainties of other sensors are also meaningful to study. Their impacts on the operation of HVAC systems need to be clear in future studies.

        "dc:description": "Economizer control is a practical and very important measure to achieve energy savings for air-conditioning systems during moderate seasons. The enthalpy-based economizer control approach is appreciated in Hong Kong due to hot-humid climates, but its performance is often affected by sensor uncertainties. Humidity sensors are especially prone to drift out of calibration, their uncertainties are critical and cannot be ignored. This study quantitatively analysed the impacts of humidity measurement uncertainties on enthalpy-based economizer control and found that they may lead to an increase of up to 35.56 % in the total energy consumption of an air handling unit. An uncertainty-tolerant economizer control strategy is proposed to reduce the impacts. The measured relative humidity of fresh air and return air can be corrected online and used to calculate the fresh air and return air enthalpies. The proposed uncertainty-tolerant economizer control strategy has been validated systematically on a virtual platform. The results showed that the average root-mean-square error of the fresh air and return air enthalpies were reduced by 87.92 and 91.39 %, respectively. Compared with the total energy consumption of the air handling unit using conventional control strategy, it was reduced by 1.02\u201324.58 % when using the uncertainty-tolerant economizer control strategy.",
