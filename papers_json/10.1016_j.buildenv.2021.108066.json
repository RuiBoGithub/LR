Division of Architecture and Urban Design Incheon National University Incheon 22012 South Korea Recently, data-driven fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) technologies have been studied extensively to detect the fault status early and maintain the health of building automation systems (BASs). Among the various algorithms for building FDD systems, an autoencoder (AE) is widely used as an unsupervised deep-learning method. Conventional AE-based FDD methods can use two types of information generated from the novel structure of the AE: (1) residual matrix (REM) and (2) latent space matrix (LSM). However, fundamental discussions about AE structures are rare, and the uses of the REM and LSM for building FDD models have seldom been compared. In this study, AE-based FDD methods are suggested. Quantitative comparisons were conducted under the designed fault conditions and real operational faults (hunting). AE-based fault detection models were designed using the AE latent space dimensionality. For fault diagnosis models, REM- and LSM-based models were used. Each model was then subdivided by the AE latent space dimensions. The detection model performances showed no meaningful differences according to the designed cases. However, for the diagnosis models, the performance of the LSM-based models was 14.4% better than that of the REM-based models. Additionally, the dimensions of the latent space caused the model performance to vary as much as 21.5%. Two main issues\u2014training data dependency and latent space dimensionality\u2014were found and investigated to improve the performance of AE-based FDD. Modeling guidelines are suggested based on the findings. These are valuable for successful FDD application with limited working sensors and datasets in real BASs. Keywords Autoencoder Building automation systems (BAS) Fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) Residual-based Latent space-based District heating system 1 Introduction 1.1 Fault detection and diagnosis in building energy systems Building automation systems (BASs) have been widely developed and applied to maintain occupant's comfort and maximize the efficiency of building energy systems [1,2]. The performance of the BAS depends highly on the health of the system measurements [3,4]. Thus, maintaining the reliability of the sensors and equipment is fundamental for stable system operation [5]. However, recent studies have shown that faulty measurement and malfunction within the sensing environment easily occur due to hardware errors and environmental errors [6,7]. These problems can spread from simple control errors to malfunctions of the entire BAS, eventually leading to thermal discomfort for the occupants and excessive energy consumption [3,6\u20139]. To address these problems, fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) systems have been studied to determine the various problems of BASs and ensure system stability. FDD is generally divided into two steps\u2014detection and diagnosis. The former determines whether the system is faulty, and the latter determines the details of the faulty situation, such as fault locations or severity. The FDD plays a major role in detecting alarm system faults at an early stage and provides diagnostic information for system managers or other building automation applications. 1.2 Review of FDD methods For decades, many researchers have focused on developing FDD with diverse methodologies. Yu et al. [10] categorized conventional FDD methods based on modeling approaches as (1) analytical-based, (2) knowledge-based, and (3) data-driven methods. Zhao et al. [11] classified FDD methods into two sectors: (1) data driven-based methods and (2) knowledge driven-based methods. Katipamula et al. [12] suggested a classification scheme for FDD of quantitative model-based, qualitative model-based, and process history-based methods. To summarize, mainstream FDD modeling methods have changed from knowledge-based and rule-based approaches to data-driven approaches, along with the development of statistical learning and artificial intelligence algorithms. In recent studies, the aforementioned methods were combined to achieve better FDD performance [11]. Fundamentally, model-based FDD is composed of input and output. The output types of the FDD model produces binary or categorical results in most cases. The binary result corresponds to a faulty or normal state in fault detection. Results from fault diagnosis models are commonly categorical because diagnosis models mostly aim to classify severity levels, fault locations, or fault types. However, model input types vary according to the information on which the model is based. Designing the type of input is a key factor for FDD model construction because it is highly related to the FDD behavior (e.g., sensitivity and performance) under given fault conditions. Thus, the appropriate input type must be determined for affordable fault detection and diagnosis model performance. In previous studies, three input types were typically used for FDD model input: (1) residual-based, (2) system-variable-based, and (3) latent space-based. Residual-based models conduct FDD using the difference between the target values and their reference values. System-variable-based models use operational data for the system variables. Latent space-based models use the features generated in the latent space. In this regard, previous FDD studies were categorized depending on their input types for detection and diagnosis, as shown in Table 1 . It was observed that FDD models can be modeled with different input types, even if they are based on the same algorithm. 1.3 FDD using autoencoder The autoencoder (AE) [32], a type of unsupervised learning-based multivariate artificial neural network (ANN), has been widely applied to FDD in various fields. The structure of an AE consists of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder compresses the input layer to the latent space, and the decoder regenerates the input layer from the latent layer in the output layer. Compared with the conventional model structure (multiple Xs to a single Y), an AE has the same dimensions for input and output based on its inherent structure (multiple Xs to multiple X\u2032s). The AE is trained to reconstruct the input layer at the output layer with minimal error. This training process is powerful for learning mathematical or physical relationships among system variables. AE can also generate new features of the original AE input data using the latent space. The AE-generated data can be used for various purposes, including model training and data visualization. These structures and features of the AE provide three opportunities for FDD. (1) Residual-based modeling can be conducted by the difference between the input and output layers of the AE. (2) Latent space-based modeling can be conducted using the generated features. (3) Integrated (system-level) FDD can be fulfilled using the multiple-input and multiple-output structure, which is not possible with component-level FDD models. Recently, various studies have been conducted on the application of AEs in FDD systems. Fan et al. [18] suggested a fault detection method for a building energy system using residuals generated from a 1D-convolutional AE. Hundi and Shahsavari [33] detected faults in thermal power plants with an established anomaly score calculated from the residuals from the AE. Yoon [34] proposed a Bayesian inference-based sensor calibration method for building energy systems that uses the AE residual as the component of the likelihood function. Das et al. [35] emphasized that dimensionality-reduced system variables can be used for an anomaly detection method. Zhang et al. [28] used a stacked sparse AE (SSAE) for the feature (representation at the AE latent space) extraction, and this feature was used for generating a diagnosis model of a fuel cell system. Liu et al. [29] suggested an indoor climate control system diagnosis model that uses the extracted features from a long short-term memory (LSTM)-combined AE as input, and it was compared with other modeling methods. Wang et al. [31] compared a stacked AE (SAE)-based refrigeration system diagnosis model with various hidden layer structures of the SAE. Additionally, an AE and principal component analysis (PCA) were combined as an ensemble method to detect anomalies in building energy consumption trends [30]. Park et al. suggested an FDD method combining an AE and LSTM network and applied it to a chemical plant [27]. These studies are summarized as follows. First, various forms of AE were used for FDD in various fields. Second, AE-based FDD methods showed promising performance. Third, residual-based and latent space-based information generated by the AE were used for the construction of the FDD model. Finally, it was observed that FDD performance can vary depending on the designed AE structure, such as the hidden layer configuration. 1.4 Practical challenges and previous limitations on AE-based FDD Previous studies proved that the AE is a powerful algorithm that can be used for not only system-level fault detection but also multiclass fault diagnosis. However, when applying an AE to BASs, the following challenges make it difficult to guarantee satisfactory performance of FDD in building energy systems. 1) AE-based FDD is trained using historical system operation datasets. The historical data do not represent all available system operation patterns but only contain partial patterns. This may reduce FDD performance under different or new patterns. 2) Conventional BASs have limited sensing environments caused by sensor absences and faulty sensors because they usually focus on the key sensors for control feedback. An AE model trained with insufficient information tends to be poorly generalized or even not well trained. In these situations, it is essential to devise more efficient AE-based FDD methods that can consider the physical relationships within the system. These challenges lead to the necessity of the comparative study between residual-based and latent space-based approaches. However, studies on the application of AE for better FDD performance have rarely been conducted. For example, it has not been determined which of the input types (residual-based or latent space-based types) is more useful for a fault detection model or a fault diagnosis model. Moreover, there are still no guidelines for the design of AE latent space for FDD in building energy systems. Latent space is the most important design factor in AE-based FDD modeling. This is because the behavior of the AE and the AE-generated datasets (residuals and latent space features) depend highly on the size of the latent space. Thus, an investigation in the latent space design is necessary to achieve successful FDD, even under limited datasets and sensors in real applications. 1.5 Objective, research questions, and contributions of this study Here, an AE-based FDD method is proposed, and insight into applying an AE to FDD for a real building energy system is provided. To achieve these goals, research questions regarding the previous limitations and practical challenges mentioned above are suggested and then answered. The major research questions are as follows. 1) Which type of input space (residual-based or latent space-based space) is better for the generalized FDD model? 2) How does the dimensionality of the AE latent space cause the FDD performance to vary in residual-based and latent space-based methods? 3) How can one overcome the training data dependency issue from limited datasets for the proposed method? To the authors\u2019 knowledge, this is the first study to determine the differences between residual-based and latent space-based FDD methods using AE for building energy systems. Through these investigations, this study provides knowledge on how the AE configurations affect FDD performance and how the best AE-based FDD can be achieved under the given operational datasets of a real system. The findings of this study show that the AE-driven FDD method has good performance, even for light faults, new fault conditions, and real operational faults (hunting faults) happened at a district heating substation. The remainder of this article is organized as follows. In Section 2, AE-based FDD methods are proposed. In Section 3, AE-based FDD is applied with the designed model cases in a real district heating substation of the target residential buildings is described. FDD results are presented and compared in Section 4 and are discussed in Section 5 regarding two major issues: (1) training data dependency and (2) latent space dimensionality. Finally, the conclusions are presented in Section 6. 2 AE-based FDD 2.1 Structure of AE An AE is a type of unsupervised learning ANN that learns to reconstruct its input (x) to its output ( x ˆ ), as shown in Eq. (1). The structure of the AE is divided into an encoder, a decoder, and a latent space, as shown in Fig. 1 . The encoder compresses the input layer (X, m-dimensional) into the latent space (L, n-dimensional), as shown in Eq. (2). The decoder decompresses the latent space to the output layer ( X ˆ , m-dimensional) to reconstruct the input layer, as shown in Eq. (3). As shown in Eq. (4), the weight matrices and bias vectors of the encoder and decoder are trained to minimize the loss function, which represents the difference between the input and output layers. The two major aims of the AE are to (1) reconstruct the input layer with minimum error and (2) obtain the dimensionally reconfigured representation (m-dimensional to n-dimensional) of the input layer in the latent space.

(5). The intrinsic structure of the AE describes the physical and mathematical relations among the measurements within the BAS. These relations correspond to the operational patterns of the system. For practical usage of the AE, if operational data without faults (normal condition) are given as an input of the AE, they are reconstructed with a small error at the output layer. However, for faulty data (abnormal condition), a large reconstruction error is obtained because measurements with faults do not match the learned pattern of the training data. Based on the aforementioned characteristics of the AE, as shown in Fig. 2(b), the fault detection index (FDI) is calculated by the absolute summation of reconstruction errors of each input variable, as shown in Eq. (6). The FDI is calculated at every timestamp (t) for real-time fault detection. Finally, an appropriate fault detection threshold is defined and used in the fault detection model (M detect ) to determine whether the calculated FDI corresponds to the faulty state, as in Eq. (7). This is shown in Fig. 2(b).

In contrast to a fault detection model (M detect ), a fault diagnosis model (M diag ) aims to classify the model input data according to the fault classes (C m ), as in Eq. (8). Each fault class indicates which sensor has which types of faults. For the diagnosis model training, the data generated from the AE (AE FDD ) are used as input. Fault diagnosis models are of two types according to the input: the residual matrix (REM)-based model and the latent space matrix (LSM)-based model. First, a REM is a matrix composed of residuals between AE input vectors (x) and output vectors ( x ˆ ), as shown in Eq. (9). Accordingly, a REM has the same dimensions as the input and output matrices. The REM represents meaningful information about how the individual input vectors were reconstructed at the output layer under the given operational conditions. Second, an LSM is the representation matrix at the latent space of the AE FDD , as shown in Eq. (10). The dimensions of the LSM differ according to the AE structure design. If the LSM dimension is greater than or equal to the input matrix, the input layer is dimensionally extended at the LSM. If the LSM dimension is less than the input matrix, the input layer is dimensionally reduced. Various classification algorithms such as multilayer perceptron (MLP), decision tree, and support vector machine (SVM) can be used to construct a fault diagnosis model (M diag ) using the REM or LSM. Finally, as shown in Fig. 2(d), the AE-based fault detection and diagnosis models are evaluated under the given fault conditions in testing datasets. (8) C m = M d i a g ( R E M o r L S M ) (9) R E M = X − X ˆ (10) LSM = f enc (W enc, FDD X + B enc,FDD ) where C is the fault class, and m is the counter of fault classes. 3 Application of actual building system 3.1 Target building with district heating substation The proposed AE-based FDD method was applied to the district heating substation (DHS) of a 27-story multifamily residential building complex in the Republic of Korea. Fig. 3 presents a diagram of the DHS showing the installed physical sensors, equipment, and meters. The left side of the heat exchanger is primary, which corresponds to the heat supply side. The right side is secondary and is the heat demand side. This substation is designed to supply heat energy to upper-level floors (15th\u201327th) in seven residential buildings from a plant. System variables in the target system are classified as control feedback, monitoring, and controlled, based on their measurement characteristics. The DHS is operated to match the secondary-side supply water temperature (T H,sup ) to the setpoint temperature. The setpoint temperature (T set ) is calculated from the outside temperature (T out ) of the building, which is the weather compensation control method [36]. The valve opening rate (V DH ) of the temperature control valve is regulated by the control signal to achieve the defined setpoint (T set ). The differential pressure ( Δ P H ) between the supply and the return paths at the secondary side is obtained from two pressure sensor measurements (P H,sup and P H,ret ) for the circulation pump frequency control. Two parallel pumps are controlled to maintain Δ P H at 1 bar under the working of the differential pressure valve. The primary side supply water temperature and the secondary return water temperature are monitoring variables that are not linked to the control loop. All the variables were measured and recorded every minute for real operational datasets. Table 2 lists the key design parameters of the target DHS. In this study, the proposed AE-based FDD was applied to the working sensors and equipment on the secondary side of the DHS. 3.2 Error levels and fault class design for DHS components As shown in Table 3 , fault classes were designed for the secondary-side system variables (P H,sup , P H,ret , T H,sup , T H,ret , and f H ) to evaluate the generated models. There are two fault types for each system variable. One is the positive fixed bias error, and the other is the negative fixed bias error. Eleven fault classes were established by the two types for five variables, including no-fault conditions. Additionally, each of fault classes had individual faults with four-level fault severities to compare the model performance differences among different fault severities. The error levels were established based on the standard deviation (σ) of each component, as shown in Table 3. Standard deviations were calculated from the distribution of each system variable. The error levels were subdivided into four levels from 1.0σ to 2.5σ. The faulty datasets were generated for three testing days by adding the designed faults (Table 3) to normal operational datasets. Designed errors were assumed to be caused by their sensor faults or other faults of related devices (heat exchanger, pumps, and valves) and controllers within the control loop. These fault conditions may cover various real operational faults, caused by sensor errors, device faults, and control performance degradation, etc., in the closed control loop of the target system. 3.3 Training fault detection models Six cases of the AE model were employed for the target system fault detection, as shown in Table 4 . The five secondary-side system variables and differential pressure (ΔP H ) measurements were used as the input to the AE model cases. This input layer was reconstructed at the output layer through the hidden layers and latent space. As shown in Table 4 and Fig. 4 , all cases were designed with the same hidden layer structure but divided into five cases depending on the dimensions of the latent space from four to eight (AE4-8). Case AE6-A, which lacks ΔP H , was designed for comparison with AE6 to show the advantages of including additional information (ΔP H ) at the input layer. The six models were trained with the operational dataset during January 1\u201331 and tested for during February 1\u20133. Operational data were preprocessed with normalization, as in Eq. (11), and a simple moving average, as in Eq. (12). The simple moving average was conducted at 10-min intervals for data noise reduction and smoothing. The training parameters, optimizer, and loss functions were defined with the same settings for all cases, as listed in Table 5 . To prevent overfitting, the training process was stopped early when the validation loss was decreased by less than 1% in five epochs [37]. The AE model training was fine at a similar level according to the R2 scores shown in Table 4. With the designed AE, the FDI, as shown in Eq. (6), was calculated for every minute of the operational dataset. Each fault detection threshold of the detection model was set to detect the normal state with 97% accuracy for no-fault testing data. As in Eq. (13), the fault detection rate (FDR) was calculated using Eq. (7) to demonstrate the model performance. The FDR indicates the ratio of true alarm times (T true ) to total faulty times (T total ). The AE models were evaluated with Error Levels 1 and 3.

For both diagnosis models, the MLP, one of the most common deep neural network models, was developed as shown in Fig. 5 and Table 6 . The models consisted of three hidden layers with the rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function [39], and the probabilities of each fault class were calculated using the softmax function [40] at the output layer. The fault class with the highest probability was selected as the diagnosis result. The model was trained using the 11 error classes with a 2 σ error severity, which corresponds to Error Level 3. The LSM-based model cases were divided into five cases, depending on the referenced AE model. The input layer dimensions of the LSM-based models were equal to the dimensions of the latent space of the reference AE. The REM-based model cases were also defined by the base AE model, but the input layer dimensions of the REM-based models were equal to six because the REM dimensions were the same regardless of the AE model cases (AE4-8). A description of the training process is presented in Table 5. The same early stopping rule was applied while training the diagnostic models. The trained models were evaluated with three main indicators: accuracy, precision, and F1-score, as in Eqs. (14)\u2013(16). The diagnosis models were evaluated for Error Levels 2\u20134. (14) Accuracy = S T P + S T N S T P + S T N + S F P + S F N (15) Precision = S T P S T P + S F P (16) F 1 - score = 2 × P r e c i s i o n × A c c u r a c y P r e c i s i o n + A c c u r a c y 4 Results The results of the FDD performance tests for each case are presented in this section. First, the fault detection results were compared according to the structure of the latent space and input layer composition. The FDR was used for quantitative comparison. Second, the fault diagnosis performances were compared according to the REM-based and LSM-based modeling methods. 4.1 Comparison of fault detection results As shown in Table 7 and Fig. 6 , the fault detection performance was good regardless of the AE model cases. All AE models detected 11 error classes with 100% accuracy under Error Level 3. At Error Level 1, which is lighter than Error Level 3, every model perfectly detected the pressure sensor faults (P H,sup and P H,ret ) and only approximately 5% of episodes were undetected for the rest of the system variables (T H,sup , T H,ret , f H ). The detection delay was less than 10 min (simple moving average interval) for all model cases. In summary, the AE cases did not show significant differences in fault detection performance. This result shows that residual-based system-level fault detection using an AE can achieve excellent performance regardless of the dimensions of the latent space under the given structures and settings. Meanwhile, the difference in the input layer composition caused the fault detection performance to vary, as shown in Fig. 7 . To show the significance of additional variables for the input layer, two models (AE6 and AE6-A) with the same network structure were used for the detection of Error Levels 1 and 3. Model AE6-A, which lacked ΔP H in the input layer, detected Error Level 3 with a similar detection accuracy to that of AE6, as shown in Fig. 7. However, at Error Level 1, AE6 showed lower fault detection accuracy on the return side variables (f H and T H,ret ) than that of the AE6-A model. This indicates that including physical-relation-based variables (such as ΔP H ) in the AE input layer helps enhance the model sensitivity to certain system variable faults. Fig. 8 shows the application of AE-based fault detection (AE6) under Error Level 3. 4.2 Comparison of fault diagnosis results 4.2.1 REM-based fault diagnosis models The fault diagnosis results using REM-based models for Error Levels 2\u20134 are presented in Table 8 and Fig. 9 . In Table 8, the fault diagnosis F1-score was calculated by fault class, and the average F1-score was calculated by each model. Error Level 3, the same error severity as the training dataset, was classified better than the other error conditions regardless of the diagnosis model cases. This reveals that REM-based models have an excessive dependency on the training datasets. Although Error Level 4 was more severe than the training data error level (expected to be diagnosed more accurately), the diagnosis results were even worse than those of Error Level 3. For several fault classes (P H,sup (+) and P H,sup (−)) in Error Level 4, the F1-score was exceedingly low (less than 0.2), even though the corresponding error class was diagnosed well at Error Level 3. In all models, the diagnosis accuracy was lower at Error Level 2 than at Error Level 4. The R7 model showed the best performance on Error Levels 2 and 3, and the R5 model showed the best performance on Error Level 4. The overall diagnostic performance was the best when the dimensions of the latent space were one more than the number of AE input dimensions. However, it was insufficient to diagnose various fault classes, especially for low-severity faults. 4.2.2 LSM-based fault diagnosis models Fig. 10 and Table 9 show the diagnosis results of the LSM-based models. Based on the overall result, the more severe the error level (from Error Level 2 to 4), the higher the diagnosis performance defined. This pattern was observed in all the LSM-based model cases (L4\u2013L8). This was the most important and different characteristic between the REM- and LSM-based models. This means that LSM-based models are more generalized than REM-based models. However, not all LSM-based model cases showed high diagnostic performance. Performance differences depended on the LSM dimensions. LSM-based models (L4 and L5), with lower LSM dimensions than the other model cases, showed a larger performance decrease, particularly for the light error condition (Error Level 2). It was found that L8 showed a slightly lower average diagnosis accuracy than L7 for all fault severities. However, neither model accurately diagnosed some fault classes (such as pressure sensor faults). The best model was L6, where the latent space dimension of the reference AE (AE6) was equal to the input dimension. 5 Discussion The results of the fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) models make it possible to discuss the issues of training data dependency and the latent space dimensionality. 5.1 Training data dependency issue The training data dependency is a problem in which a trained model is biased against the training data. A trained model with this problem shows affordable performance under similar data conditions to the training data condition, but it shows low performance in other data conditions. This indicates that the model is poorly generalized by physical relationships between system variables; thus, expecting high performance is difficult when it is applied to a real system. This problem is difficult to be addressed by optimizing the hyperparameters in the training process because it is not caused by training methodologies but rather the data features. The dependency issue occurs in detection and diagnosis models, but it is more crucial in fault diagnosis models. This is because a detection model is learned using only a normal dataset to detect anomalies. However, a diagnosis model is trained with fault-labeled (multi-conditioned) datasets to classify multiclass faults under unknown fault severities. In this case, the model has the potential to be biased toward a specific condition (training dataset condition). Solutions to this problem can be considered to train models with datasets that have sufficient fault conditions and severities. However, expanding the range of the training dataset is not an easy task because preparing the dataset by not only fault classes but also severities requires an exponentially larger dataset. Fig. 11 shows the average diagnostic performance of the REM- and LSM-based models based on error levels. In Fig. 12 , the performance comparison between the best REM-based model (R7) and the best LSM-based model (L6) is presented by the error levels and classes. As shown in Figs. 11(a) and 12(a), the REM-based models depended highly on the training data and showed unbalanced performance by error level. However, the LSM-based models showed a balanced diagnostic performance with improved diagnostic performance as the error level increased, as shown in Figs. 11(b) and 12(b). This implies that it is better to use the LSM than the REM for diagnosis model input because the features of the AE input variables are represented and generalized better at the LSM than the REM. This idea can also be observed in the visualization of the LSM and REM. In Fig. 13 , the LSM and REM are reduced in dimension to two-dimensional space and visualized using the efficient manifold learning method, uniform manifold approximation, and projection (UMAP) [41]. As shown in Fig. 13(b), all error classes were well separated in the LSM. However, in the REM, some error classes were not clearly distinguished, as shown in Fig. 13(a). This visualization underpins the different characteristics of the REM-based and LSM-based methods mentioned above. 5.2 AE latent space dimensionality issue The AE latent space dimensionality issue is that the AE-based FDD model performance differs according to the dimensions of the AE latent space. This issue has a different influence on FDD. Differences in the dimensions of the latent space had a slight impact on the detection model. The detection model performances rarely varied by dimension. As shown in Fig. 6, the detection model performances rarely varied by dimension. However, the dimensions of the latent space created a dramatic performance difference in LSM-based fault diagnosis. As shown in Figs. 10 and 11(b), when using the lower latent spaces (L4 and L5), the training data dependency issue, particularly for the light fault condition (Error Level 2), could not be solved, even by the LSM-based method. The reduced latent space was too small to cover the fault features, thereby having low sensitivity to the light fault condition. Thus, it is recommended to use the LSM-based fault diagnosis method with suitable latent space and REM-based fault detection method with economical latent space if the computational power is considered as well as accuracy. 5.3 Real application case (hunting faults) Based on the findings of the case study, the proposed AE-based FDD was applied into the same target DHS (as shown in Fig. 3) for a different operation period with actual hunting faults happened at the supply water temperature (T H,sup ). The operational hunting faults were caused by the low water flow rates (low heating loads) under the wrong control settings. The FDD models defined in Section 3 were used for this real application. The two hunting thresholds were set respectively at 1.03 °C and 2.2 °C. The former was defined by the Fault Level 1 of T H,sup in Table 3. The latter was the average difference between the supply water temperature (T H,sup ) and the setpoint for the real application period. Fig. 14 shows the different levels of real hunting faults and the detected hunting distributions for the two threshold cases. The proposed method could have good fault detection performance (about 85% and 91% respectively for the two threshold cases) for the real fault features. The distributions of the real hunting faults captured could be found as shown in Fig. 14. For the hunting diagnosis, as shown in Table 10 , the LSM-based approach was better than the REM-based one for the both threshold cases, as compared in Section 4.2. F1-score of the LSM method was about 0.909 and 0.971, respectively for the two cases, in three testing days of hunting periods. 6 Conclusions An AE-based FDD methodology was proposed for BASs. Modeling guidelines were established in terms of structural understanding (AE-generated data features and latent space dimensionality). The suggested guidelines can help obtain successful FDD models that overcome practical building system challenges regarding operational datasets and sensing environments. The case study and findings are as follows. For fault detection, model cases were designed based on the dimensions of the AE latent space. All models achieved a fault detection rate of more than 99% within the given error conditions. All detection models showed affordable performance, but using an AE model with a small latent space for the fault detection model is recommended. This is because simplifying the computing process in the model is efficient for practical system applications. For fault diagnosis, REM- and LSM-based models were suggested and evaluated with different fault cases. The best LSM-based model showed a diagnostic accuracy of 0.920 (F1-score), while the best REM-based model showed an F1-score of 0.776. The REM-based model showed a training data dependency issue, which led to performance degradation on datasets with different error severities (levels). The LSM-based models showed better performance and sensitivity than the REM-based models. This implies that the LSM is more effective than the REM in representing the features of system variables and their relationships. In other words, when the diagnosis model is trained to distinguish various system operational patterns, the LSM is more advantageous than the REM. However, the latent space dimensionality issue was observed among the LSM-based models. This issue indicates the performance degradation that occurs when the model is designed with inappropriate latent space dimensions. Therefore, determining the proper latent space dimensionality is required to derive a successful diagnosis model, especially for a real system with limited operational datasets and sensor absences. In this study, the proposed AE-based FDD was tested under the limited fault conditions (such as biases and single hunting faults) with fixed thresholds. Even though the designed fault conditions can cover various operational faults in the closed control loop of the target systems as seen in Section 5.3, future studies are necessary to achieve real effective application in BAS. Based on the findings and insights discussed in this study, the proposed AE-based FDD with adaptive thresholds will be validated under the real operational faults (sensor errors, device and control faults, and their simultaneous combinations) in the target system. And, the generative models for operational faults can be developed through the real application.

        "dc:description": "Recently, data-driven fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) technologies have been studied extensively to detect the fault status early and maintain the health of building automation systems (BASs). Among the various algorithms for building FDD systems, an autoencoder (AE) is widely used as an unsupervised deep-learning method. Conventional AE-based FDD methods can use two types of information generated from the novel structure of the AE: (1) residual matrix (REM) and (2) latent space matrix (LSM). However, fundamental discussions about AE structures are rare, and the uses of the REM and LSM for building FDD models have seldom been compared. In this study, AE-based FDD methods are suggested. Quantitative comparisons were conducted under the designed fault conditions and real operational faults (hunting). AE-based fault detection models were designed using the AE latent space dimensionality. For fault diagnosis models, REM- and LSM-based models were used. Each model was then subdivided by the AE latent space dimensions. The detection model performances showed no meaningful differences according to the designed cases. However, for the diagnosis models, the performance of the LSM-based models was 14.4% better than that of the REM-based models. Additionally, the dimensions of the latent space caused the model performance to vary as much as 21.5%. Two main issues\u2014training data dependency and latent space dimensionality\u2014were found and investigated to improve the performance of AE-based FDD. Modeling guidelines are suggested based on the findings. These are valuable for successful FDD application with limited working sensors and datasets in real BASs.",
