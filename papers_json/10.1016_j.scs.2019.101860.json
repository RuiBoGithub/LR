Graphical abstract Coupling modelling and monitoring has always been a very challenging task aiming for indoor air pollution control towards the construction of safe, healthy and energy-efficient building environments. Currently, numerous fast prediction models were proposed but facing a dilemma of prediction accuracy and speed to satisfy the engineering application. This work will systematically introduce the establishment of dynamic ventilation online control system, which relies on a newly developed faster-than-real-time prediction model by incorporating limited monitor data, and further put it forward to the real application. An experimental ventilation chamber was considered. To rapidly predict non-uniform indoor pollutant concentration, the fast prediction method was adopted by incorporating monitoring data (ZigBee-based monitoring sensors) to LLVM (low-dimensional linear ventilation model)-based ANN (artificial neural network) model. Visualization of the control effect was also displayed. It was found that based on the evaluation index EV , the ventilation control system could show favorable performance with energy conservation and indoor pollutant level (e.g., CO2) respectively decreasing up to 43.8% and 28%. This work will provide a significant guidance for the development and application of intelligent ventilation online control system in the perspectives of constructing healthy and energy-efficient indoor environments for sustainable buildings. Keywords Intelligent ventilation control Indoor air quality (IAQ) Energy efficiency Visualization Artificial neural network (ANN) Low-dimensional linear ventilation model (LLVM) 1 Introduction Mechanical ventilation systems have been popularly used for the improvement of indoor air quality (IAQ) by supplying a constant air change rate per hour (ACH) for various buildings (especially in non-residential buildings, e.g., public and industrial buildings) (Persily, 2015; Tian et al., 2019). Particularly, during the special noxious and explosive environments accompanying with the unanticipated leakage of pollutant or hazardous gas (e.g., for the metal smelting and petrochemical industries), prescribed ACHs have been excessively increased to maintain acceptable and safe IAQ (Ben-David & Waring, 2016; Khalil, 2017; Wang & Cao, 2017). To this end, 80\u201390% of the yearly growth of industrial energy consumption can be attributed to ventilation responsible for 21% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and additional annual 250 billion dollars of economic losses (DARA & Climate Vulnerable Forum, 2012; Huang et al., 2016; Lee, Eom, Cho, & Koo, 2019), which is largely hindering the speed up of sustainable industrial development. In non-residential buildings, indoor environment quality (IEQ) is mainly linked with actual occupancy and interior production activities, which may result in the uniform, unsteady and even sharply-varying distributions of environmental parameters (Ryu & Moon, 2016). In this circumstance, holding fast to the traditional ventilation with adequately fixed ventilation rates (ACH) seems to be no longer economical and reasonable in the perspectives of energy efficiency and sustainability (Chenari, Carrilho, & da Silva, 2016). To overcome this defection, it is of great necessity to exploit and develop intelligent and dynamic control systems for the improvement of traditional ventilation systems, i.e., flexibly optimizing the relationship between ventilation rates (up to the minimum security requirement) and energy conservation responding to the dynamically polluted indoor environment. An intelligent ventilation system for dynamic control primarily involves three key steps, including (i) \u2018monitoring\u2019, (ii) \u2018prediction\u2019 and (iii) \u2018control\u2019, as shown in Fig. 1 . A very important issue in this system is to rapidly obtain non-uniform indoor pollutant concentration, which can be used for ventilation assessment and fast-decisive adjustment. Hereby, prediction model is highly replying on the initial input from on-line monitoring data. Specifically, monitoring system is to utilize the limited and well-deployed sensors to automatically record on-line targeting pollutant concentrations (Jin, Liu, Schiavon, & Spanos, 2018; Yang, Chen, Den, Wang, & Kristiani, 2019). With the monitoring data as inputs, the next step is referring to the rapid prediction of indoor environments (i.e., non-uniformly distributed indoor pollutant concentration fields) under different conditions of ventilation (e.g., different ACHs) (Cao & Ren, 2018). As the core part of dynamic ventilation control, the prediction models are supposed to be relatively accurate and more importantly faster than real time, i.e., the predicting time should be far less than the actual pollutant dispersion time to reach the quick and efficient ventilation self-adjustment, further ensuring the safety and reliability of indoor environment in advance of hazardous accident (Cao, 2018). Once we can rapidly predict non-uniform distributions of indoor pollutant concentration under different ventilation conditions, fast decision for automatic ventilation control can be realized on the basis of optimal evaluation strategy, i.e., minimizing ventilation energy consumption (ACH) on the request of acceptable indoor environment, which can contribute to the optimization of energy structure (Hesaraki, Myhren, & Holmberg, 2015). Corresponding to the aforementioned crucial parts, several major issues and techniques must be addressed and developed to realize dynamic control of ventilation systems. One of the key issues is how to achieve faster-than-real-time prediction of indoor environment. Numerical simulation, such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD), is possible to predict IAQ (Ai & Mak, 2017; Li et al., 2018; Wang, Dols, & Chen, 2010) but difficult to be employed for online control due to the limitations of calculation time and data storage capacity as well as the identification of pollutant sources (location and strength) (Cao, 2018). Thus, seeking for other faster prediction methods is very desirable, such as the tactics of reducing computational grids or solving partial differential equations (Feng, Yu, & Cao, 2019). With the assumption of uniform airflow, zone/multizone model can greatly decrease the prediction time of indoor environment to a few seconds by computing a few nodes in a region (Tian, Sevilla, Zuo, & Sohn, 2017; Wang & Chen, 2008). Nevertheless, after neglecting the Navier-Stokes equations, the prediction accuracy of this model would be significantly sacrificed, especially for complex and dynamically varied indoor environment. In order to overcome the limitations inherent in solving governing equations, fast fluid dynamic (FFD) has been proposed for rapid prediction of indoor environment, which can be around 50 times faster than the pure CFD in simulation time (Liu & Chen, 2018; Liu, Jin, Chen, You, & Chen, 2016; Zuo & Chen, 2010). Yet, due to the disregard of vital turbulence characteristics, FFD cannot satisfy the high accuracy of some environmental distributions (e.g., pollutant) currently (Feng et al., 2019; Liu, You, Zhang, & Chen, 2017). According to the above models, the precision and speed demands for indoor environmental prediction have not been well balanced. In view of this shortcoming, another advanced prediction method, i.e., artificial neural network (ANN), was exploited to combine with limited CFD cases for faster-than-real-time prediction of any indoor environmental parameter (Zhang & You, 2017). In our previous work, Cao et al. employed the ANN method to train and expand low-dimensional database of CO2 concentration for realizing the further ventilation control strategy (Cao & Ren, 2018). Actually, via using CFD-based ANN, the prediction time for indoor environment was largely reduced to less than 10\u202fms along with the acceptable deviation below 10%, which showed excellent performance in dynamic ventilation control (Ren & Cao, 2019, 2019b). Next to fast prediction models, the second challenge is how to use the monitoring technology to effectively represent the non-uniform distribution of indoor environment. Directly using sensors for monitoring particulate matters (PMs) and gaseous pollutants to determine IAQ has practical and technical limitations. These instruments are expensive and incapable of providing high-resolution spatiotemporal data, which is important for quantifying the peak exposure levels in order to design and implement mitigation strategies (Kumar et al., 2016). More importantly, these monitored concentration data should be essential input information for above-mentioned rapid prediction models, replacing the straightforward input of pollutant sources, i.e., strength and location, etc. In the numerous latest studies, demand-controlled ventilation (DCV) has been promoted for residential and public sectors to adjust ventilation rate (ACH) based on actual monitoring data (Clark, Less, Dutton, Walker, & Sherman, 2019; Zhang, Su, Wang, & Wang, 2018). So far, it was common for DCV to use the single sensor data near the exhaust outlet in the decision-making and assessment about IAQ, which can be incorrect because of the dynamic and non-uniform pollutant distribution (Cao, Zhu, & Yang, 2016; Deng, Feng, & Cao, 2018; Merema, Delwati, Sourbron, & Breesch, 2018). The technology of employing limited sensors (considering the cost) to acquire the whole indoor environmental distributions in a certain zone has been investigated by Ren and Cao, which developed the favorable function of ANN in the reconstruction of indoor environment, i.e., rapid prediction of non-uniform environmental fields using the low-dimensional models only based on several hypothetical sensor data (Ren & Cao, 2019, 2019b). The combinations of using limited monitoring data, fast prediction models and ANN methods can potentially provide a promising theoretical support for the dynamic ventilation control but still lack of real engineering application. To sum up, coupling modelling and monitoring has always been a very challenging task aimed for air pollution control, which is also relevant to multi-discipline knowledge and techniques, e.g., building environment, CFD simulation, ZigBee wireless communication and monitoring as well as control logic, etc. The current work will systematically summarize the establishment of dynamic ventilation online control system. To the authors\u2019 best knowledge, this work should be the first to utilize fast prediction models into the real application of ventilation online control system. This prediction model mainly adopted the ANN method relying on reliable training data through the incorporation of limited online monitoring data and fast prediction models, i.e., low-dimensional linear ventilation model (LLVM) (Cao & Meyers, 2012). By selecting the CO2 concentration as a typical representative of indoor environmental parameters (Cao & Deng, 2019), this ventilation control system was set up on the strength of transparent experimental chamber. Moreover, for the sake of improving readership, this work would also demonstrate the control effect through clear and dynamic smoke visualization. The present work will promote the development and application of intelligent ventilation system in the perspectives of indoor safety, health and energy sustainability. 2 Materials and methods In this work, the ventilation online control system was realized based on an experimental chamber with visualization device. CFD simulation was mainly employed to construct the database of pollutant concentration (considering the variables of different ACH values and CO2 sources). The accuracy of CFD was also validated by the corresponding experimental test. Then, based on initial CFD database, low-dimensional linear ventilation model (LLVM) was adopted to reconstruct the database, including its expansion (linear superposition of pollutant concentration fields) using linear ventilation model (LVM) and the volume-averaged process with the low-dimensional discretization method (reducing grid data storage). Next, for the fast prediction of indoor pollutant concentration, artificial neural network (ANN) was utilized based on LLVM, i.e., LLVM-based ANN. From the view of cost and engineering application, the monitoring data of three sensors are sufficient as ANN inputs. Further, the prediction results were applied in the ZigBee-based ventilation control with a ventilation evaluation index EV for the obtaining of the optimal ACH. Additionally, in this study, CO2 concentration was considered as environmental indicator. Fig. 2 displayed the flow chart for the present work. 2.1 Experimental chamber and CFD simulation In the current study, a testified indoor chamber was established. Fig. 3 illustrated the actual photo and geometry for this experimental chamber with the dimensions of 1.5\u202fm (X) ×1.2\u202fm (Y) ×1.0\u202fm (Z). One ventilation mode with the up-supply and down-return air diffusers was considered in this work. Although another air duct was connected to the top-supply air diffuser, ventilation mode was not the focus of this work and this air duct was fully sealed up. According to the actual speed range of fan, six values of ACH were determined as 7, 9, 11, 13, 15 and 17. These ACH values were calculated by the inlet airflow velocity, which was measured by the hot-wire anemometer KANOMAX KA23. Furthermore, we designed six CO2 sources with the positions located at A (1.05, 0.45, 0.33) m, B (0.75, 0.45, 0.33) m, C (0.45, 0.45, 0.33) m, D (1.05, 0.75, 0.33) m, E (0.75, 0.75, 0.33) m and F (0.45, 0.75, 0.33) m. The CO2 source was generated by a dry ice bucket with thick foam layers for insulation, which has been verified in our previous work (Cao & Deng, 2019). The release rate of CO2 source (per position) was controlled as 5\u202f×\u202f10−6 kg/s (obtained by electronic balance T100), and the background concentration of CO2 was measured as 440 parts per million (ppm) by the monitoring instrument testo 535. A large number of CFD simulations were carried out corresponding to experimental setup. As a powerful tool to calculate the indoor environmental parameters (e.g., airflow and concentration fields), computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has been developed and employed (Wu, Feng, & Cao, 2018; Zhou, Deng, Wu, & Cao, 2017). Considering the computing expense and Reynolds effect, Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) has a popular application in the CFD simulations (Cao, Cen, Zhang, & Feng, 2017). In this study, the steady Re-Normalization Group (RNG) k-ε model was considered, which could show the best performance in the indoor environmental simulation among all the RANS turbulent models (Koufi, Younsi, Cherif, & Naji, 2017). The number of adopted CFD mesh grids was 1,552,186 and the grid independence analysis showed good results (less than 5% errors) when compared with finer grids, as shown in Table 1 . At the inlet, the uniform velocity-inlet was used, and turbulence intensity and turbulence viscosity ratio were respectively 5% and 10. The boundary condition at the outlet was set as outflow, and the enhanced wall function was adopted to ensure y+ < 5. Moreover, the CO2 sources in the simulation were compiled by UDF (User Defined Function) with the same release rate as above. In summary, there were total 36 numerical simulation cases (6 ACHs × 6 pollutant sources) in the initial CFD database for the further step. 2.2 Low-dimensional linear ventilation model (LLVM) Based on CFD database, low-dimensional linear ventilation model (LLVM) was mainly used to reconstruct the initial database, including the expansion process with linear ventilation model (LVM) and the volume-averaged process with the low-dimensional discretization approach. With regard to LVM, the basic principle was linear superposition of the pollutant concentration fields produced by any indoor pollutant source within the steady airflow (Cao & Meyers, 2013). For instance, when there were multiple indoor pollutant sources, the concentration fields resulting from these pollutant sources were equal to the linear superposition of ones from single pollution source, i.e., the expansion of pollutant concentration data. Next, combined with LVM, we further used the discrete method to implement LLVM, which could largely reduce the amount of grid data. Fig. 4 showed the schematic diagram of low-dimensional discretization process. Firstly, the mesh grid with volume V was divided into a number of cubes Ci respectively with volume Vi (i\u202f=\u202f1 ˜ n, n << cell number), and the coordinates (x, y, z) in Ci were also allocated into the group Gi along with the corresponding CFD data. Secondly, the volume-averaged value of Ci was calculated by all the data in Gi. Thirdly, we utilized the low-dimensional discrete data of Ci (after volume-averaging process) to represent the primary high-resolution grid data. In the current work, we divided the grid volume V into 3\u202f×\u202f3 × 3 cubes with the trisection in the directions x, y and z with acceptable discretization errors, which has been discussed in our previous work (Cao & Meyers, 2012) and (Cao & Ren, 2018). 2.3 LLVM-based artificial neural network (ANN) using limited monitoring data as inputs Following the previous LLVM, artificial neural network (ANN) method was further adopted to construct LLVM-based ANN model in order to rapidly predict the indoor pollutant concentration from the response, i.e., monitoring data. ANN is a sophisticated model based on the nervous system, which could construct the mapping relationships from a large number of inputs to outputs (Yuan, Farnham, Azuma, & Emura, 2018). The common neural network was composed of an input layer, a hidden layer and an output layer. Through the increase of units in hidden layer, the reliability and complexity of the association equation between inputs and outputs was added simultaneously. In this work, a radial basis function (RBF) network with three layers was used in the training and prediction of pollutant concentration due to the good approximation and learning ability (Liao & Wen, 2007). The effect of ANN prediction is very depending on the reliability and efficiency of prediction data (called as training database) using LLVM. As shown in Fig. 5 , during the training period using cases considering the combination of all the aforementioned initial ACHs and CO2 sources, we took the concentration data of limited monitoring sensors as inputs (from experimental tests) and the volume-averaged concentration data of 27 zones (cubes) as outputs (from CFD simulations). Then, in the prediction period, low-dimensional concentration fields would be efficiently predicted and reconstructed based on the corresponding monitoring data without considering (knowing) the positions of CO2 sources. For the cases with unscheduled ACHs (i.e., ACH equal to 8, 10, 12, 14 and 16), the concentration fields could also be efficiently predicted by using the cases with initial ACHs (i.e., ACH equal to 7, 9, 11, 13, 15 and 17), which has been verified in our previous work (Cao & Ren, 2018). According to our previous work, it was possible to use three hypothetic sensors for acceptable concentration prediction when sensors placed near the \u2018well-mixed zone\u2019 and outlet zone (Ren & Cao, 2019, 2019b). Hence, in the current study, two monitoring points were fixed close to the air return diffuser and one monitoring point was placed in the mixing zone, as displayed in Fig. 6 . In addition, the data of these monitoring sensors would be further used in the validation of CFD simulations using experimental tests. 2.4 Optimal ventilation evaluation and visualization of ventilation online control system With the well-trained LLVM-based ANN, it was efficient to predict the low-dimensional pollutant concentration fields with the limited monitoring data as inputs. Next, we would apply the prediction results from LLVM-based ANN into ventilation evaluation for optimal ventilation rate (ACH). Indeed, as the ACH value increased, the pollutant removal performance would get better. However, after the ACH value came up to a certain level, the removal efficiency of indoor pollutant was not so obvious and the ventilation energy efficiency correspondingly declined (Cao et al., 2016) showing a trend of asymptotic behavior. Thus, in order to provide an optimal balance between indoor pollutant concentration and energy consumption, one control strategy to synthetically assess CO2 concentration and ACH value seems necessary for the ventilation system. Especially, we focused on the mean CO2 concentration in the breathing zone (Cmean ) to stand for indoor CO2 level in this work. These two targets (including ACH and Cmean ) were then weighted into one evaluation index EV , as shown below. (1) E V = w 1 A C H M a x ( A C H ) + w 2 C m e a n M a x ( C m e a n ) where, w1 and w2 are respectively the weights for ACH and Cmean , which were obtained by the coefficient of variation (CV) method (Calif & Soubdhan, 2016). In this equation, Cmean value was actually obtained from prediction result of CO2 concentration and Max(Cmean) may be unknown before control process. To this end, we used the Cmean value obtained from reconstructed CFD-based LLVM database to get the maximum Cmean , as shown below. (2) E V = w 1 A C H M a x ( A C H ) + w 2 C m e a n - p r e d i c t i o n M a x ( C m e a n − C F D ) where, Cmean-prediction is the Cmean value obtained from LLVM-based ANN prediction result, and Cmean-CFD is the Cmean value acquired from reconstructed CFD-based LLVM database since the maximum Cmean-CFD could be determined in advance before the control process. The validations between CFD-based LLVM and LLVM-based ANN results were carried out in the next section. After the index EV defined, it was eventually applied to ventilation online control for the optimal ACH. Correspondingly, the ventilation online control system was further established on the basis of aforementioned experimental platform. Fig. 7 illustrated a set of integrated ventilation online control system constructed in the current study. According to the layout of monitoring points (ref., Fig. 6), three CO2 sensors (Sensor 1, 2 and 3) were respectively fixed in three control panels at the corresponding positions. Besides, another control panel was connected to the fan to realize the automatic control of ACHs (ranging from 7 to 17). Fig. 8 presented the wiring diagram and photo images for the sensor control panel and fan control panel. The grid topology between these control panels was all based on ZigBee wireless communication through 2.4\u202fGHz ZigBee wireless modules due to the strong networking ability (Hong, Kim, Kim, & Kim, 2014). The DL-20 radio frequency module was adopted to realize the ZigBee communication network. In the sensor control panel, the type of CO2 sensor was MH-Z19B and these sensors were all adjusted to record data automatically with the interval of 20\u202fs through the program settings. Through the pulse-width modulation (PWM), the monitoring data of CO2 concentration could be obtained by the following equation. (3) C m = 2000 × T h − 2 m s T h + T l − 4 m s where, Cm is the monitoring CO2 concentration after calculation with the unit of ppm, and Th or Tl is the time when the output is up to high or low level in an output cycle, with the unit of millisecond (ms). Besides, the PCF8591 fan driver module was installed in the fan control panel to well execute the instructions about optimal ACH. Fig. 9 displayed the control flow chart for the draught fan on the basis of monitoring inputs, fast prediction model and ventilation evaluation strategy. Through relay switching, the voltage values corresponding to different ACHs were actually utilized in the data transmission of fan terminal. To intuitively display the actual control effect in this ventilation system, we added the smoke generator AG 1000\u202fW and colored strips (ref., Fig. 7) respectively for the visualizing of CO2 release and fan ACH changing, which were required in the latter visual results. Through the remote control, this visualization device could continuously emit smoke which was sufficient for the response of control panel after release of CO2. Although the device may generate the smoke with particulate matter (PMs), the density of particle was as small as that of CO2. Hence, the smoke produced from this device could approximately reflect the CO2 diffusion effect, and it was only utilized for the purpose of visualization. In addition, a camera with the high-definition (HD) wide angle lens was placed about 1.2\u202fm away from the chamber for the photography of CO2 releasing and dynamic control effect of ventilation system, as illustrated in Fig. 10 . For the highest quality of visual results, multiple videos about the actual control were filmed (lasting around 3\u202fmin for each video) with different changing processes of ACHs for three types of CO2 sources: source (A), sources (A and B), and sources (A, B and E). Then, three videos were selected and edited to display the precise control about fan ACHs of this ventilation system (i.e., respectively corresponding to stabilization, great change and minor variation of fan\u2019s ACHs after control), as shown in Table 2 . From the above, this ventilation control system could potentially behave well with the assistance of these ZigBee-based control panels, and the actual control effects would be further discussed. 3 Results In this section, on the basis of limited monitoring inputs, LLVM-based ANN was mainly applied in the ventilation online control system for the obtaining of the optimal ACH (ventilation adjustment). Firstly, CFD simulation was verified by the experimental data, and the accuracy of LLVM was also validated by CFD. Then, taking the finite monitoring data as inputs, LLVM-based ANN model was well trained for the prediction of CO2 concentration fields (volume-averaged data). Next, combined with ventilation evaluation index, the prediction results from LLVM-based ANN were further employed in the optimal ventilation control. The actual control effects were also visualized based on the transparent experimental platform with visualization device. Moreover, the control performance was presented in terms of CO2 removal and ventilation efficiency. 3.1 Validation for CFD simulation using experimental test In order to verify the CFD accuracy, corresponding experimental tests on CO2 removal effects were carried out. According to the previous section, three sensors were separately set up in the experimental chamber to monitor the CO2 concentration. Through the program settings, these sensors could record data automatically with the interval of 20\u202fs. Then, after CO2 sources releasing for 10\u202fmin, we utilized the average values of recorded monitoring data (during 20\u202fmin) to validate CFD simulation results (volume-averaged concentrations of certain grid points around sensor positions) with ACH equal to 11, as shown in Table 3 . It was found that numerical simulation results could be accepted when compared with experimental ones for three situations of pollutant sources: source (A), sources (A and B), and sources (A, B and E). When we looked at the three sensor positions, the maximum error was around 17.5% at the position of Sensor 3 for source A, which could meet the requirement of engineering application. Hence, the CFD simulation could be sufficiently utilized in the next steps. 3.2 Validation for LLVM (low-dimensional linear ventilation model) using CFD simulation In this work, LLVM was utilized for the reconstruction of CFD database, including the usage of linear ventilation model (LVM) and low-dimensional discretization process. The function of LVM was to realize the expansion of initial CFD database. The low-dimensional discrete method was mainly combined to reduce the data amount by volume averaging of concentration fields. Here, the volume of concentration field (for each CFD case) was uniformly divided into 27 (3\u202f×\u202f3 × 3) cubes and the corresponding discretization error would be displayed later. As a premise for the next prediction step, the accuracy of LLVM called for the validation. Fig. 11 showed the comparison of CO2 concentration fields between direct CFD simulation and LLVM with pollutant sources A and B and ACH equal to 11. It can be seen that the CO2 concentration obtained by LLVM showed good agreement when compared to CFD result with the maximum error less than 13% (expect for the region of pollutant source). Therefore, we could consider that LLVM method was able to effectively obtain the discrete distribution of CO2 concentration produced by any pollutant source in the engineering application. 3.3 Prediction of LLVM-based ANN (artificial neural network) using limited monitoring data as inputs Combined with the efficient prediction method of LLVM, ANN method was further employed in LLVM-based ANN for the rapid prediction of pollutant concentration. In this study, we selected the concentration data of 3 monitoring sensors as ANN inputs and the volume-averaged concentrations of 27 zones (cubes) as outputs (ref., Fig. 5). Then, with the well-trained ANN method, the validity of LLVM-based ANN using limited monitoring data as inputs required to be verified with low-dimensional CFD simulation (i.e., CFD-based LLVM). Fig. 12 showed the comparative results of low-dimensional CO2 concentration fields respectively obtained from LLVM-based ANN and CFD-based LLVM with the conditions of three types of pre-selected pollutant sources when ACH equal to 11. Fig. 12(a) displayed the layout and serial number of these 27 zones. Fig. 12(b), (c) and (d) corresponded to the cases with the pollutant sources respectively located at position (A), position (A and B), and position (A, B and E). Evidently, the low-dimensional CO2 concentrations from LLVM-based ANN could agree well with the corresponding CFD-based LLVM results with the maximum errors below 10\u202fppm. Next, the application of LLVM-based ANN with the finite monitoring data as inputs would play an effective role in the ventilation online control. 3.4 Application of LLVM-based ANN for ventilation online control and visualization of control effect In the previous step, the LLVM-based ANN method showed fine performance in the prediction of indoor non-uniform pollutant concentration by taking limited monitoring data as inputs, which would provide important evaluation information for ventilation control. According to Eq. 1, we defined ventilation evaluation index EV in order to provide an optimal balance between indoor pollutant concentration (Cmean ) and energy consumption (ACH). In this study, we assumed the minimum EV corresponded to the optimal ACH for the best balance between Cmean and energy consumption, and the maximum EV corresponded to the ACH value for the worst balance between Cmean and energy consumption. The weighting coefficients for ACH and Cmean were respectively calculated as 0.74 and 0.26. Next, the ventilation control results on the strength of LLVM-based ANN (using limited monitoring inputs) would be presented. Table 4 listed the selections of optimal ACHs (corresponding to minimum EV ) after using ventilation evaluation in terms of different cases (compared to the ACH values corresponding to maximum EV ). In practice, the locations of indoor pollutant sources were unknown, and the pollutant positions in Table 4 were added for better understanding of corresponding cases. As can be seen from Table 4, the optimal ACH values for different cases had significant differences within the ranges of 7 and 13. Then, if the locations of pollutant sources (unknown in practice) varied randomly, this control strategy could rapidly respond to optimal ACHs on the basis of real-time monitoring data of CO2 concentrations. In view of the actual control effect, Fig. 13 showed the visual results of ventilation online control about the inlet ACH for three cases 1, 2 and 3. Moreover, to clearly display the control process, Fig. 14 presented a set of video screenshots at different time nodes for case 2, from CO2 releasing (t\u202f=\u202f0\u202fs) with reference ACH value (ACH\u202f=\u202f7) to optimal ACH response (t\u202f=\u202f7\u202fs). All the videos about control process for three cases could refer to Appendix A. In these visual results for cases 1, 2 and 3, the changing processes of ACHs from reference ones to optimal ones were respectively used to display the precise control of this ventilation system, i.e., stabilization, great change and minor variation of fan ACHs after using ventilation control (ref., Table 1). After the sensors obtaining the data, the inlet ACHs (reference values) of environmental chamber could automatically change to 7, 9 and 11 (optimal values) in the cases 1, 2, and 3 on the basis of ventilation evaluation decision. The one important fact we need to clarify is that after the sensors acquiring the data, this ventilation control system can also rapidly response to the optimal ACHs for other situations with different ACHs except for the reference ones. The other important fact we need to clarify is that we started the sensor a bit in advance of pollutant emitting for the sake of more accurately recording the response time of ventilator adjustment, i.e., the response time is around 7\u202fs shorter than the recording time (20\u202fs as mentioned in methods) of sensors. Then the ventilation system could efficiently realize the automatic control for ACH adjustment based on limited sensors. 3.5 Performance of ventilation online control in the perspectives of pollutant removal and energy efficiency With the intention of verifying the validity of ventilation online control by using LLVM-based ANN method (with three monitoring data as inputs), the control performance should be further demonstrated in the perspectives of both CO2 removal and energy efficiency. We then compared and analyzed Cmean levels and fan energy consumption of this ventilation system between the strategies with optimal ACHs corresponding to minimum EV and the ACHs corresponding to maximum EV . Besides, based on the optimal ACH, the CO2 removal performance (starting from the optimal fan\u2019s adjustment until the visual effect of pollution becoming well-mixed or vanished) was also displayed. In order to indicate the maximum efficiency for pollutant removal and energy saving in the current study, Fig. 15 respectively illustrated the comparisons of Cmean-prediction values and fan energy consumption between ventilation strategies with optimal ACHs corresponding to minimum EV and ACH values corresponding to maximum EV . In the study, the values of energy consumption were calculated by multiplying the running time and input power of fan (related to ACH). For all cases, the running time was determined as 8\u202fh per day (regular working time). In Fig. 15, it can be noticed that with the increasing numbers of pollutant source, higher CO2 concentration level was reduced (with the maximum percentage up to 28%), which indicated the greater significance of ventilation online control for stronger pollutant source. Furthermore, the energy consumption for cases 1, 2 and 3 was largely decreased with the maximum up to 43.8% by using ventilation control strategy. Next, on account of the optimal ACH, the visual outcomes (with twice playback speed) about CO2 removal performance was further presented (time starting from the optimal fan\u2019s adjustment until the visual effect of pollution becoming well-mixed or vanished), as shown in Appendix B. For cases 1, 2 and 3, the reference time of CO2 diffusion (until the pollutant concentration of mixing zone was uniform) was separately around 25\u202fs, 25\u202fs and 15\u202fs in the current study. Evidently, with the optimal ACHs of fan automatically adjusted, indoor CO2 would be efficiently removed. 4 Discussion Currently, directly using limited monitoring sensors to determine indoor air quality (IAQ) for ventilation control has practical and technical limitations due to the incompetence of providing high-resolution data for non-uniform distribution of pollutant concentration. Fast prediction models are possible to rapidly obtain the indoor pollutant concentration field, yet these models are challenging to be adopted in actual control envrionment because of identification of pollutant source and requirement of prediction accuracy. To address the above issues, a set of intelligent ventilation online control system through incorporating limited monitoring data and fast prediction model (i.e., LLVM-based ANN) was implemented in this work, which could be the leading edge of intelligent ventilation development. As a core of this system, LLVM-based ANN method has played a significant role to save simulation time and data storage compared with the pure CFD method. For instance in the current study case, the prediction time for ANN was decreased to about 10\u202fms, and the amount of data storage was reduced from millions (about hundreds of megabytes) to double digit (about hundreds of kilobytes), with the reduction percentage up to 99%. More importantly, the LLVM-based ANN prediction model can accomplish faster-than-real-time reconstruction of low-dimensional concentration fields by taking three sensor data as inputs. By this token, the ventilation control system presented in this study can potentially have the favorable contribution to intelligent ventilation facility in sustainable buildings and environments. Nevertheless, in order to further improve the applicability, some limitations of this ventilation online control system also need to be focused on. On the one hand, several environmental factors were neglected in this ventilation control system, such as temperature, humidity, other contaminants (e.g., PMs). As the important evaluation index of indoor environmental quality (IEQ), the temperature and humidity influence has drawn more attention. Recently, numerous studies have developed strategies for heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system to improve the deteriorated conditions of indoor temperature and humidity (Afroz, Shafiullah, Urmee, & Higgins, 2018; Deng, Feng, Fang, & Cao, 2018; Kong, Xi, Li, & Lin, 2019). However, the investigations about the interaction among pollution, temperature and humidity have been facing enormous challenges, due to the nonlinearity of actual environmental distributions (i.e., simultaneously considering the influence of pollutant, temperature and humidity). In our previous work, we continued to expand the idea of Linear Ventilation Models (LVM) on indoor thermal comfort with Low-dimensionalLinear Temperature Model (LLTM) and Contribution Ratio of Indoor climate (CRI) to provide dependable support for HVAC online control, which is capable of rapidly predicting the indoor environmental temperature (Ren & Cao, 2019, 2019b). In the future study, humidity factor should be considered. Besides, a large number of other harmful contaminants would simultaneously exist in the actual environment, such as PM2.5, PM10, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), nitrous oxides (NOx), etc. (Li, Xi, Kong, Lin, & Wang, 2020). In this situation, instead of CO2, the optimal targeted pollutants for monitoring should be determined for the different building environments considering monitoring cost and accuracy, which will be another focus of our future work. On the other hand, the feasibility of this current ventilation control system should be further investigated in the actual environment of various buildings (especially for non-residential or industrial buildings). In this work, we established a small-scale experimental platform to implement ventilation online control system, which could be the first step and foundation of promoting the intelligent ventilation online control system into actual building environment. Indeed, a small space may contribute to this well-behaved system combined with three sensors. When it comes to the larger or irregular space (e.g., public and industrial buildings), this control system is likely to be modified with more sensors and more complex dynamic requirements. In this circumstance, the layout strategies of limited sensors for different buildings were necessary for the further development of ventilation online control system, which should be investigated in the future work. In addition, subject to the current fan, the certain range of ACHs was considered in this study. To better promote ventilation control system, smaller or larger ACHs also need to be validated in the future work. To sum up, in order to facilitate the present intelligent ventilation online control system into real-life building environment, the above-mentioned challenges are required to be considered. Although the present ventilation online control system was constructed on the strength of small-scale experimental platform, this work can potentially provide the significant guideline and direction for the future development of smart ventilation control system of buildings with large space or hazardous environment. In the next stage, a set of powerful HVAC online control system should be exploited and set up (as shown in Fig. 16 ) as well as the layout strategies of limited sensor positions for various buildings, aiming at the better contribution to sustainable development of existing urban buildings and environments (e.g., the non-residential buildings with large space). 5 Conclusions Combined with limited monitoring data and faster-than-real-time prediction model, this work aimed to popularize the advanced ventilation online control system in various buildings to balance the relationship between IAQ and energy efficiency. The LLVM method was mainly employed to expand and reconstruct the CFD database by reducing the data amount with acceptable error. The LLVM-based ANN model was adopted to rapidly predict indoor pollutant concentration through taking three sensor data as inputs. Then, the prediction results of concentration field were further utilized in the ventilation evaluation for optimal ACH. Ultimately, this ventilation control system was set on the strength of experimental chamber (with visualization device and ZigBee modules), in order to visualize the actual control effect. The following conclusions can be drawn. (1) By largely reducing data amount, LLVM could effectively accomplish the discretization of CFD concentration fields with the maximum error below 13%, which was acceptable in the engineering application. (2) The well-trained LLVM-based ANN method could show significant performance in the rapid prediction of CO2 concentration fields on the basis of using monitoring data from three sensors as ANN inputs, with the maximum deviation below 10\u202fppm compared with CFD simulations. (3) After applying LLVM-based ANN prediction results into ventilation evaluation, the ventilation control system could respectively decrease the energy consumption and indoor CO2 level with the maximum percentages up to 43.8% and 28%. (4) The ventilation online control system established in this work could run well with the assistance of ZigBee wireless communication, which would provide the vital reference for the application of smart ventilation control system to the actual and sustainable buildings.

        "dc:description": "Coupling modelling and monitoring has always been a very challenging task aiming for indoor air pollution control towards the construction of safe, healthy and energy-efficient building environments. Currently, numerous fast prediction models were proposed but facing a dilemma of prediction accuracy and speed to satisfy the engineering application. This work will systematically introduce the establishment of dynamic ventilation online control system, which relies on a newly developed faster-than-real-time prediction model by incorporating limited monitor data, and further put it forward to the real application. An experimental ventilation chamber was considered. To rapidly predict non-uniform indoor pollutant concentration, the fast prediction method was adopted by incorporating monitoring data (ZigBee-based monitoring sensors) to LLVM (low-dimensional linear ventilation model)-based ANN (artificial neural network) model. Visualization of the control effect was also displayed. It was found that based on the evaluation index EV , the ventilation control system could show favorable performance with energy conservation and indoor pollutant level (e.g., CO2) respectively decreasing up to 43.8% and 28%. This work will provide a significant guidance for the development and application of intelligent ventilation online control system in the perspectives of constructing healthy and energy-efficient indoor environments for sustainable buildings.",
