Most of the existing predictive models for heating station, which are based on outdoor meteorological parameters, are feed-forward adjustment, without considering the influence of building thermal inertia on heating parameters. Most importantly, indoor temperature is not taken into account as a influence factor or a feedback adjustment factor, resulting in high heating consumption and low thermal comfort. In this paper, firstly, the secondary supply temperature predictive model based on building thermal inertia was established, and cross-correlation analysis method was used to determine the adjustment cycle and time. Then, the modified model of the solar radiation, the uncertainty of outdoor temperature and the heat consumer behavior on the heating parameters were established respectively, which were used to correct the supply temperature and achieve closed-loop control. Finally, the proposed model was applied to a heating station, the results show that after adopting the model, the fluctuation range of the opening valve is small, the standard deviation is significantly reduced, i.e. good stability of pipe network. The difference between the maximum and minimum indoor temperature is small, i.e. high thermal comfort. The energy-saving rate is 5.8 ± 0.1%, and the lower the target indoor temperature is, the higher the energy-saving rate is, i.e remarkable energy-saving effect.

With the development of intelligence, most heating stations in China have realized remote monitoring and control of heating parameters, so the staff can check heating parameters of the whole heating system anytime and anywhere, and make energy-saving control strategies timely, which means that the high heating consumption caused by backward infrastructure has been gradually reduced, but there are still problems of poor thermal comfort and high heating consumption [1,2]. Therefore, it is important to improve the operation efficiency of heating system for energy-saving, emissions reduction and thermal comfort improvement. The operation efficiency of heating system can be improved by changing the form of heating system and formulating reasonable control methods. At present, the heating system form in China is mainly large-scale district heating, which can greatly improve the utilization efficiency of energy [3]. The form is as follows: the heat source, the primary pipeline and the high-temperature side of the heating station constitute the primary network, the low-temperature side of the heating station, secondary pipeline and heat consumer constitute the secondary network, as shown in Fig. 1 . As a key hub connecting the primary and secondary networks, the reasonable control of the heating station\u2019s operation parameters is very important for improving the system operation efficiency. It is costly for heating enterprises to install a series of adjustable devices in each heat consumer, and even if these devices are installed, due to the fixed heating charges based on heating area rather than actual heating consumption in China. There is few incentive for consumers to reduce the target indoor temperature in an oversupply situation, which means the circulation pump of the secondary network adopted constant frequency operation during the heating period. Therefore, the widely used method for improving the operation efficiency of heating station is to build the secondary temperature model to meet the demand-heating [4\u20136], including supply temperature and return temperature, which are based on the outdoor temperature, i.e. climate compensation, called feed-forward control method [7]. The advantage of this method is simple modeling, and the disadvantage is that even under the premise of reasonable modeling, it may not be conducive to energy-saving, consumption reduction and thermal comfort improvement, because it only relies on the current outdoor temperature, regardless of other factors that cause changes in indoor temperature, such as additional heat gains from the sun, electrical appliances and other internal heat sources, which can lead to indoor overheating or excessive cooling [8]. A large number of studies have shown that outdoor temperature cannot be the only basis for secondary temperature adjustment, solar radiation, wind speed and humidity should be taken as the influencing factors, especially the solar radiation [9,10], which can make indoor temperature rise abruptly. In addition, the predicted meteorological parameters should be applied to the building identification model to compensate the lag characteristics of the current climate compensation adjustment [11]. The model predictive control (MPC), which combines climate compensation with predictive model, has been widely used in heating energy conservation management in recent years [12\u201314]. MPC includes a mathematical model, which uses the historical input and output data to predict the output in a certain period of time in the future, and obtains the optimal control law of current and future sampling cycles by minimizing the quadratic objective function with control constraints and prediction errors [15]. MPC is being used in heating system for optimal heating, and reduction of peak energy demand in buildings [16,17]. Petersen et al. [18] proposed a predictive control method for simulating the operation of building systems at the early stages of design, and obtained the method can achieve 7% energy saving effect while satisfying the indoor comfort, but this method is mainly used in the building design stage, and not combined with the heating system. Široký et al. [19] uses MPC with meteorological predictions to study the heating system of investigated buildings, the energy-saving rate is between 15% and 28% depending on various factors, mainly insulation level and outdoor temperature. Above researches show that MPC can achieve greater energy-saving effect than climate compensation method, in order to better apply MPC to guarantee the building thermal comfort, scholars have optimized the meteorological prediction model in recent years [20,21]. Unfortunately, these optimizations are based on mathematical methods, rather than the physical factors that affect the system operating parameters from the professional perspective. Besides, due to the delay of heating pipe network, the building thermal inertia is a major influencing factor [22,23]. Wang et al. [24] shows that building thermal inertia can greatly improve the prediction accuracy of heating consumption. At the same time, the key of MPC is to find an appropriate prediction model, which is highly professional, and it is based on a non-trivial mathematical background that limits its usage in practice, and most existing MPC do not take the indoor temperature as the influencing factor or feedback adjustment factor, so as to achieve closed-loop control. Thomas et al. [25] investigated P-control with and without feedback for temperature control of a small single-building through simulations, and obtained that the latter reduce the energy consumption while improving the control performance (smaller temperature variations). Furthermore, dynamic feedback gives better performance than static feed forward, and static feed forward gives better performance than no feed-forward at all. Dahlblom et al. [8] evaluated a feedback control method for hydronic heating systems based on indoor temperature, the results showed that the proposed method is less dependent on the outdoor temperature than the control method with feed-forward and thermostatic radiator valves. The above studies applied the feedback control method to the single household and achieved good results, and for the heating station, there are few studies on the application of feedback control method in practical engineering. The reason is that compared with a single household, whose system is relatively small and the response time of adjustment parameters and indoor temperature is short, the heating station has more influencing factors and more complex regulation [26]. In summary, the following conclusions can be drawn from the existing studies: (1) building thermal inertia has a great influence on the predicted heating parameters of heating station; (2) feedback control method based on indoor temperature can better maintain the constant indoor temperature; (3) in addition to the supply heating, the solar radiation, and heat consumer behavior also affect the change of indoor temperature. Unfortunately, the above research results have not been all taken into account in the existing predictive models, which means that supply heating can not be carried out accurately according to consumer\u2019 requirement, this is an area where existing models can be further improved. In addition, the existing MPC modeling process is relatively complex and professional, which is the reason why there are few practical engineering applications. At the same time, a predictive model that can be applied in practical engineering should not only consider the accuracy of the model itself, but also consider other factors, such as when is the predicted time point of the predicted value, how long is the interval between predicted values, how to correct the uncertainty value and so on. In this paper, the deficiencies of the existing model are solved, and the determining method of each factor that affects the application of the prediction model in practical engineering is given systematically. Firstly, a new feedback predictive control model based on building thermal inertia and indoor temperature is built, secondly, the method for determining the adjustment cycle and time is proposed, thirdly, the modified model of the solar radiation, the uncertainty of outdoor temperature and other indoor disturbances on the heating parameters are established respectively. Finally, the model is applied to a practical engineering, and the accuracy of the model is evaluated from network operation stability, indoor thermal comfort and energy-saving effect. 2 The feedback predictive control model (FPCM) The FPCM includes three parts: (1) Determine the temperature predictive model of heating station, which is based on the theoretical sensitivity analysis; (2) Determine the adjustment cycle and time; (3) Determine the modified model, i.e. feedback, which is the influence of other disturbances on operating temperature, including the solar mediation intensity, the uncertainty of outdoor temperature, and the heat consumer behavior, etc. 2.1 Theoretical sensitivity analysis The research shows that the first-order linear model can meet the demand of control accuracy. Therefore, this paper applies Eq. (1) to describe the dynamic change process of heat consumer\u2019s indoor temperature [27]. (1) ρ V C p , a ∂ T i n ∂ τ = K r F r ( T p j − T i n ) − K F ( T i n − T o u t ) Eq. (1) shows that the change rate of indoor temperature is related to the difference between heat dissipation of radiators and buildings. The goal of fine heating is to keep the indoor temperature constant, which means ρ V C p , a ∂ T i n ∂ τ = 0 in a short time, i.e. K r F r ( T p j − T i n ) = K F ( T i n − T o ) . Define γ = KF/K r F r , which characterizes the thermal performance of the buildings, i.e. building thermal inertia, Eq. (2) can be obtained according to Eq. (1): (2) γ = K F K r F r = T p j − T i n T i n − T o Therefore, the average temperature in time period i can be obtained as: (3) T p j i = ( γ i + 1 ) ⋅ T i n i - γ i ⋅ T o i In time period i + 1 is: (4) T p j i + 1 = ( γ i + 1 + 1 ) ⋅ T i n i + 1 - γ i + 1 ⋅ T o i + 1 The Eq. (5) can be obtained by Eq. (4) minus Eq. (3): (5) T p j i + 1 − T p j i = ( γ i + 1 + 1 ) ⋅ T i n i + 1 − ( γ i + 1 ) ⋅ T i n i − γ i + 1 ⋅ T o i + 1 + γ i ⋅ T o i In the ideal case, the indoor temperature is a constant value, which does not change with the outdoor temperature, i.e. T i n i + 1 = T i n i , and the traditional control model indicates that heating parameters have a linear relationship with outdoor temperature, i.e. T p j i = φ ⋅ T o i + δ . Therefore, T p j i + 1 − T p j i = φ ⋅ ( T o i + 1 − T o i ) . Eq. (5) can be written as follows： (6) φ ⋅ ( T o i + 1 − T o i ) = ( γ i + 1 − γ i ) ⋅ T i n i − ( γ i + 1 ⋅ T o i + 1 − γ i ⋅ T o i ) Define ( T o i + 1 − T o i ) = △ T o , Eq. (6) can be written as follows： (7) φ ⋅ △ T o = ( γ i + 1 − γ i ) ⋅ ( T i n i − T o i ) − γ i + 1 ⋅ △ T o The T i n i − T o i is a known quantity, which is defined as ϕ , so： (8) φ ⋅ △ T o = γ i + 1 ⋅ ( ϕ − △ T o ) − ϕ ⋅ γ i (9) φ ( ϕ − △ T o ) ⋅ △ T o + ϕ ( ϕ − △ T o ) ⋅ γ i = γ i + 1 Define φ ( ϕ − △ T o ) = β , ϕ ( ϕ − △ T o ) = α , so Eq. (10) can be obtained by substituting Eq. (9) into Eq. (4). (10) T p j i + 1 = [ α ⋅ γ i + β ⋅ △ T o ] ( T i n i + 1 − T o i + 1 ) + T i n i + 1 For the large heating station, when the consumer heat inlet has no control equipment, hydraulic imbalance will occur in secondary network. If the secondary average temperature ( T p j ) is used as the control parameter, the imbalance between the proximal and distal building will be increased. While using the secondary supply temperature ( T g ) as the control parameter can ensure that the supply temperature of each building is consistent, and reduce the thermal imbalance. Therefore, the secondary supply temperature is usually adopted as the control parameter, it can be obtained by two times for secondary average temperature minus the return temperature. For the precise control, different outdoor temperatures correspond to different supply/return temperature, the higher outdoor temperature is, the lower supply/return temperature is, but the increasing or decreasing rate of supply/return temperature is not the same. It is difficult to get the return temperature corresponding to the outdoor temperature, and the difference of supply and return temperature in the adjacent time period is small, the change value is ξ (°C), so the secondary supply temperature predictive control model obtained is as follows. (11) T g i + 1 = ( T i n i + 1 − T o i + 1 ) ⋅ γ i + 1 + T i n i + 1 + ( T g i − T h i + ξ ) / 2 2.2 The change value ξ The hourly correlation for the supply/return temperature and outdoor temperature is poor, which is affected by the delay of pipe network and the behavior of regulation. But in a long period of time, the higher the outdoor temperature is, the lower the supply/return temperature is. The formula between the daily supply/return/average temperature and the outdoor temperature for the heating station can be expressed as follows: (12) T g = A ⋅ T o + B (13) T h = C ⋅ T o + D (14) T p j = ( A + C ) 2 ⋅ T o + ( B + D ) 2 Therefore, the formula for calculating ξ is seen in Eq. (15): (15) ξ = ( T p j i + 1 − T p j i ) ⋅ | A − C | | ( A + C ) / 2 | 2.3 The adjustment cycle and time （1）Adjustment cycle. The purpose of heating is to reach the target indoor temperature, so the adjustment cycle ( T ) should be the same as the change of indoor temperature. Buildings with different envelops have different thermal insulation performance, and the change of indoor temperature with good insulation is large, and vice versa. （2）Adjustment time. After the T is determined, if the delay is not taken into account, and the first adjustment time is assumed to be 0 : 00 , so the adjustment time is 0 : 00 , T : 00 , 2 T : 00 \u2026. But for precise adjustment, two delays should be considered, the first one is the delay time τ 1 that outdoor temperature acts on the indoor temperature through building envelope, the second one is the network delay time τ 2 due to the distance between the heating station and heat consumers. Cross-correlation analysis is used to determine the two delay time, the principle is as follows: the cross-correlation function (CCF) R x y ( τ ) for function x ( t ) and y ( t ) is as follow. (16) R x y ( τ ) = lim T → ∞ 1 T ∫ 0 T x ( t ) y ( t + τ ) d t CCF is used to represent the degree of correlation between two time series, and the movement of two time series signals on the time axis, e.g. one time series signal does not move, while the other starts to move at the starting point, after moving n moments on the time axis, the similarity degree of the two time series signals reaches the highest, i.e. CCF has the biggest value, which indicates that there will be n time delay between the two signals on the time axis. The determination of τ 1 and τ 2 are the cross-correlation analysis of real-time outdoor/indoor temperature, and the secondary supply/return temperature respectively. After the two delays are determined, the adjustment time of the heating station is 0 : 00 , ( T + τ 1 − τ 2 ) : 00 , ( 2 T + τ 1 − τ 2 ) : 00 \u2026. 2.4 The modified model （1）Solar mediation intensity. The proposed secondary temperature predictive model is based on the indoor temperature, so the predictable factors that cause the change of indoor temperature should been taken into account, so as to realize refined control. Solar mediation intensity will cause the indoor temperature to rise sharply at noon, the relationship is as follows: (17) △ T i n ∧ = f ( S r ) The solar mediation intensity does not cause the indoor temperature to drop, the two are positively correlated, i.e. the higher S r is, the higher △ T i n ∧ is, but it doesn\u2019t mean that when S r = 0, △ T i n ∧ = 0. Maybe when △ T i n ∧ = 0, S r ＞0, in order to avoid calculating △ T i n ∧ ＜0, which is impossible, define ψ to be the value of S r , when △ T i n ∧ = 0. （2）The uncertainty of outdoor temperature. The outdoor temperature for the Eq. (11) is the predicted value, but maybe there is a certain error between the predicted and actual value. In order to ensure the accuracy of the model, the difference between T o a c t u a l and the predicted outdoor temperature is calculated every 10 min, which is consistent with the time interval that the meteorological data obtained from the Internet, and the value can be set according to the actual situation of each project. (18) △ T o a c t u a l = T o a c t u a l − T o i + 1 Eq. (18) is taken into Eq. (11) to obtain the modified model of supply temperature caused by outdoor temperature change is as follows: (19) △ T g , o i + 1 = κ i + 1 ⋅ △ T o a c t u a l （3）Heat consumer behavior. In order to ensure the constant indoor temperature, the heat consumer behavior, such as window opening, cooking, etc, should been taken into account. Therefore, a correction between T i n a c t u a l and T i n i + 1 is made every 10 min, the modified model is as follows. (20) △ T i n = T i n a c t u a l − T i n i + 1 Eq. (20) is taken into Eq. (11) to obtain the Eq. (21), which is the modified model of the secondary supply temperature as △ T i n . (21) △ T g , i n i + 1 = ( γ i + 1 + 1 ) ⋅ △ T i n 2.5 The flowchart of FPCM According to the above analysis, the application flow of the new feedback predictive control model of heating station proposed in this paper is shown in Fig. 2 . 3 The application of FPCM 3.1 Case system A heating station in Tianjin, China was selected as the research object. The heating area was 72600 m 2 , the number of households was 550, and 17 buildings were included, the heating terminal was floor radiant. The design supply/return temperature was 110/60 °C for the primary network, and 50/40 °C for the secondary network. The remote transmission equipment installed includes: primary/secondary supply and return temperature, supply and return pressure sensor, heat meter, circulating pump, filling pump, electric control valve, etc. The accuracy of the heat meter is grade 2, the maximum permissible error is calculated by Eq. (22) [28]. The data storage cycle is 10 min. The control strategy was designed as follows: the primary electric control valve adopted PI control to achieve the target secondary supply temperature as shown in Fig. 3 . There is no adjustment equipment at the consumer heat inlet, and 10% of heat consumers are equipped with wireless indoor temperature sensors for temperature collection, a total of 55, all of which adopt low-power Lora protocol and corresponding wireless gateway for collection. The installation of indoor temperature sensors for each building follows the uniform distribution principle, i.e. including the household on the top floor, the bottom floor, the middle floor, and the sensors are fixed on the wall by means of adhesive. For the object system, 18 sensors were installed on the top floor, 20 on the middle and 17 on the bottom floor. According to the specification [29], the sensors are installed in activity area, the distance from the ground or floor is 700\u2013800 mm, and the sensors should not be affected by the solar radiation or indoor heat source directly. Therefore, the sensors are installed in the switch position on the wall of the living room. The data acquisition frequency is 1 min. (22) Δ = ± ( 3 + 4 ⋅ △ t min △ t + 0.02 ⋅ q p q ) % 3.2 Determination the change value ξ The relationship between the daily supply/return temperature and the outdoor temperature for the object heating station is shown in Fig. 4 , it shows that the fitting degree is high, the fitting relation between average temperature and outdoor temperature is Eq. (23). (23) T p j = − 0.761 ⋅ T o + 39.35 Therefore, Eq. (15) can be expressed as Eq. (24), and Eq. (11) can be written as Eq. (25) for the object heating station. (24) ξ = ( T p j i + 1 − T p j i ) ⋅ 0.522 (25) T g i + 1 = ( T i n i + 1 − T o i + 1 ) ⋅ γ i + 1 + T i n i + 1 + ( T g i − T h i + ( T p j i + 1 − T p j i ) ⋅ 0.522 ) / 2 3.3 Determination the adjustment cycle and time （1）Adjustment cycle. Fig. 5 shows the change of indoor temperature before heating, i.e. with the change of outdoor temperature, indoor temperature also changes. Even though the hourly change of indoor temperature is small, it generally rises and falls with outdoor temperature. Therefore, in order to ensure T i n i + 1 = T i n i , the adjustment cycle should be consistent with the change of indoor temperature, i.e. T = 1 h. （2）Adjustment time. The data in Fig. 4 was used to calculate CCF between the outdoor temperature and indoor temperature, the result was shown in Fig. 6 . When τ 1 = 1 h, the maximum CCF is 0.831, indicating that the change of indoor temperature have a 1 h delay compared with that of the outdoor temperature. The delay time of the pipe network was determined by analyzing the CCF of the secondary supply/return temperature, the analysis data is shown in Fig. 7 . It shows that the change of supply temperature and return temperature is consistent, but the occurrence time of the highest and lowest values is different, i.e. the delay. The CCF is shown in Fig. 8 , it shows that the delay time is 2 h, the maximum CCF is 0.984, indicating that the delay time of the double pipe network is 2h, so the single τ 2 = 1 h. The above analysis shows that τ 1 = 1, τ 2 = 1, so the adjustment time for the object heating station is 0:00, 1:00, 2:00, 3:00 \u2026\u202623:00. 3.4 Determination the modified model The change of indoor temperature for the no-heating household over a period of time is shown in Fig. 9 , it shows that indoor temperature rise abruptly at noon, when the solar mediation intensity is large, and the indoor temperature decreases instantaneously with the decreasing of solar radiation. The rising value of indoor temperature with different solar mediation intensity is shown in Fig. 10 . Fig. 10 shows that the stronger the solar mediation intensity is, the higher the rising value of indoor temperature will be. The correlation between the two is shown in Eq. (26). (26) △ T i n ∧ = 0.003 S r − 0.695 Note: when solar mediation intensity is below 231W/㎡, the effect on △ T ∧ i n can be ignored, i.e. ψ = 231 W/㎡. For the object heating station, T = 1 h, ξ = ( T p j i + 1 − T p j i ) ⋅ 0.522 , and ψ = 231W/㎡, Eq. (17) is replaced by Eq. (26) in the Fig. 1. 3.5 Evaluation index 3.5.1 Evaluation index of the pipe network stability The standard deviation (SD) is adopted to judge the variation degree of daily valve opening, which is the degree to the measurement data deviates from the mean value, and the formula is as follows: (27) s = ∑ ( x i − x ¯ ) 2 n Eq. (27) is applied to evaluate the amplitude of the valve opening for the application of the empirical control method (ECM) and FPCM. 3.5.2 Evaluation index of thermal comfort The goal of FPCM is to reduce energy consumption on the premise of satisfying the thermal comfort, which can reflect in small change range of indoor temperature. Therefore, the effect of thermal comfort was evaluated by the change of indoor temperature in a day. (28) △ t i n = T i n max − T i n min 3.5.3 Evaluation index of energy-saving effect Compared with ECM, the FPCM is not only reflected in stability network operation and good thermal comfort, but also in energy-saving and consumption reduction. Energy-saving rate is introduced to evaluate energy-saving effect, as shown in Eq. (29). (29) η = Q t r a Q n e w ⋅ 100 % 4 Result and discussion 4.1 Analysis of operation stability of pipe network There are many heating stations under the jurisdiction of a heat source, ranging from dozens to hundreds. Section 3.1 has been introduced that the object heating station meets the secondary supply temperature by adjusting the valve opening, and the change of the valve opening will affect the change of the network pressure, then affect the safe operation of the network. For a heating system, pipeline characteristic curve is shown in Fig. 11 , when the valve opening in most heating stations becomes smaller, the pipeline characteristic curve becomes steeper, from 1 to 2, at this time the heat source main circulation pump flow decreases, head increases, which run away from the high efficiency point, and will appear pipeline overpressure phenomenon, affecting the safe operation of the network. When most of the valve opening becomes bigger, network characteristic curve slow, from 1 to 3, the main circulation pump flow increases, head decreases, which also run away from the high efficiency point, even when the head cannot satisfy the most adverse resistance of pipelines, the most unfavorable heating station cannot reach heating demand. Therefore, considering the operation safety of the network and meeting the heating demand of all heating consumers, this paper analyzes the change of the valve opening for the object heating station, which controlled by ECM and the FPCM, as shown in Fig. 13, and the solar mediation intensity and wind speed during the experiment is shown in Fig. 12 . Fig. 12 shows that the maximum daily solar mediation intensity fluctuates not much during the experiment, around 450 W/㎡, and the influence of wind speed ( v ) on indoor temperature is mainly through cold air infiltration. According to Ref. [30], when the wind speed is lower than 3 m/s, its influence on the indoor temperature need not be considered. During the experiment, the wind speed is lower than 3 m/s most of the time, and there is no v ＞3 m/s for a long time. The ECM is adopted from November15 to December 8, and the FPCM is from December 9 to December 24, Fig. 13 shown that, before adopting FPCM, the secondary supply temperature fluctuates greatly, leading to a large fluctuation range of valve opening, after adopting FPCM, the fluctuation of secondary supply temperature and valve opening are small. Fig. 14 shows the daily average, maximum and minimum values of valve opening, it can be seen that the difference between the daily maximum and the minimum value is large for most time from November 15 to December 8, i.e. the safety of the pipe network is poor, such as on November 17, the maximum value is 100%, the minimum valve is 18.51%, and the difference reaches more than 80%. From December 8 to December 24, the difference is small, and most of the time the opening valve is between 40% and 60%. In order to better show the fluctuation of opening valve during the day, Eq. (27) is used to evaluate the daily variation of the opening valve, as shown in Fig. 15 . Fig. 15 shown that, the standard deviation for valve opening is large before adopting FPCM, and the amplitude is also large for different day, with a maximum value of 24.97, a minimum value of 2.62, and an average of 13.31, after adopting FPCM, the standard deviation is small, daily variation amplitude is small, with a maximum value is 10.68, a minimum value of 2.85, and an average of 6.1. Therefore, compared with ECM, the FPCM can guarantee the safe operation of the network. 4.2 Analysis of thermal comfort The goal of the FPCM is to ensure that the indoor temperature reaches the target value, or slightly fluctuates around the target value, i.e. high thermal comfort. The setting target indoor temperature of the object heating station is 23 °C from December 9 to December 24. Fig. 16 shows the change of indoor temperature before and after adopting FPCM. Fig. 16 (a) shows that the indoor temperature fluctuate greatly, with a maximum value of 24.62 °C, a minimum value of 22.71 °C, and a difference of 1.91 °C, which means poor thermal comfort and high energy consumption. At the same time, the indoor temperature continues to drop at the end of the period, because the operator thinks that the previous indoor temperature is too high, so when the outdoor temperature decreases, the heating parameters do not increase accordingly, which is very common for ECM. In Fig. 16 (b), the indoor temperature fluctuates slightly around 23 °C, with a maximum value of 23.4 °C, a minimum value of 22.6 °C, and a difference of 0.8 °C, i.e. high thermal comfort. The operation results show that the proposed FPCM can ensure indoor temperature at 23 ± 0.4 °C. Eq. (28) is used to evaluate the daily fluctuation of indoor temperature, as shown in Fig. 17 . As shown in Fig. 17, from November 15 to December 8, the difference of maximum and minimum value ( △ t i n ) is large, with the maximum value of 0.7 °C and the average value of 0.46 °C. One main reason is that the influence of S r is not taken into account, for example on November 17, the maximum value of indoor temperature is 24.08 °C at 1:00 pm, the minimum value of 23.38 °C at 8:00 a.m. The S r is 412 W/㎡ at 1:00 pm, Eq. (26) calculates △ T ∧ i n = 0.54 °C, which means that if the S r is taken into account, the indoor temperature will not reach 24.08 °C at 1:00 pm, and △ t i n will decrease. After adopting the FPCM, the maximum △ t i n is 0.38 °C, and the average △ t i n is 0.29 °C. Therefore, the FPCM can guarantee the constant indoor temperature and high thermal comfort. 4.3 Analysis of energy-saving effect For the ECM, the main goal is to ensure that the heat consumers do not complain, as a result, the over-supply heating often occurs, and the FPCM is based on the target indoor temperature to adjust the heating parameters, to ensure that the indoor temperature is constant and does not change with the outdoor temperature. Table 1 is the heating parameter for different time periods, and the error analysis of calculated heating consumption was made by Eq. (22), it shown that the average indoor temperature from November 15 to December 8 is relatively high, reaching 23.87 °C. While the actual average indoor temperature from December 9 to December 24 is 23.1 °C, because the target indoor temperature was set at 23 °C. In addition to outdoor temperature, there are many factors affecting the change of indoor temperature, such as consumer behavior, indoor heating equipment, etc., called internal factors. Meanwhile, the measured heating consumption of the heating station is composed of the actual heating consumption of the consumer and the heating loss of the pipe network, the heating loss is affected by heating parameters, outdoor temperature, the length of pipeline, etc. Because we studied the different operating periods of the same system, and believed that the internal factors presented periodic changes, and the difference of heating loss was not large, that is, the main reason for the change of indoor temperature is the supply heating. So if the operating parameters are adjusted according to the target indoor temperature of 23 °C from November 15 to December 8, the average heating consumption is 37984.22 kWh, the corresponding energy-saving rate ( η ) is 5.8 ± 0.1%. The standard indoor temperature in China\u2019s heating system is 20 ± 2 °C [31], and the energy-saving rate corresponding to different target indoor temperature is shown in Table 2 . When the target indoor temperature is 20 °C, the energy-saving rate will reach 20.92%, the energy-saving potential is huge. 5 Conclusion The purpose of heating is to create a comfortable indoor environment, in addition to supply heating and outdoor temperature, the parameters that affect the change of indoor temperature include solar radiation and heat consumer behavior, etc. Meanwhile, the building thermal inertia is a very important factor affecting the heating parameters of heating stations. In this paper, firstly, a predictive model of secondary supply temperature based on building thermal inertia and indoor temperature is established, the delay time of outdoor temperature acting on object building, and the heating station to heat consumer is determined by cross-correlation analysis, followed by the adjustment cycle and time are determined. Then, the modified model of solar radiation, the uncertainty of outdoor temperature and heat consumer behavior on the heating parameters are established. Finally, the proposed feedback predictive model is applied to the heating station, and the following conclusions are obtained. (1) Stability of pipe network: the amplitude of opening valve is large before adopting FPCM, the maximum SD is 24.97, the minimum is 2.62, and the average is 13.31. After adopting FPCM, the SD is small, with the maximum value of 10.68, the minimum value of 2.85, and the average value of 6.1. It can be concluded that the proposed FPCM can guarantee the safe operation of the network. (2) Thermal comfort: before adopting FPCM, the difference between the maximum and minimum daily indoor temperature is large, with the maximum of 0.7 °C, the average of 0.46. After adopting FPCM, the maximum difference value is 0.38 °C, and the average value is 0.29 °C. (3) Energy-saving effect: the object heating station operates based on the target indoor temperature of 23 °C, and the energy-saving rate is 5.8 ± 0.1%. The successful application of the proposed predictive model in practical engineering provides guidance for the heating station to achieve energy-saving heating.

        "dc:description": "Most of the existing predictive models for heating station, which are based on outdoor meteorological parameters, are feed-forward adjustment, without considering the influence of building thermal inertia on heating parameters. Most importantly, indoor temperature is not taken into account as a influence factor or a feedback adjustment factor, resulting in high heating consumption and low thermal comfort. In this paper, firstly, the secondary supply temperature predictive model based on building thermal inertia was established, and cross-correlation analysis method was used to determine the adjustment cycle and time. Then, the modified model of the solar radiation, the uncertainty of outdoor temperature and the heat consumer behavior on the heating parameters were established respectively, which were used to correct the supply temperature and achieve closed-loop control. Finally, the proposed model was applied to a heating station, the results show that after adopting the model, the fluctuation range of the opening valve is small, the standard deviation is significantly reduced, i.e. good stability of pipe network. The difference between the maximum and minimum indoor temperature is small, i.e. high thermal comfort. The energy-saving rate is 5.8 ± 0.1%, and the lower the target indoor temperature is, the higher the energy-saving rate is, i.e remarkable energy-saving effect.",
