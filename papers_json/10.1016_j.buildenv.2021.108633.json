Yonsei University 50 Yonsei-ro, Seodaemun-gu Seoul 03722 Republic of Korea This study aims to propose Real-COMFORT - a novel occupant-centered real-time indoor temperature control system using deep learning algorithms to simultaneously optimize the thermal comfort and energy consumption of individual occupants. Based on chamber experiments with wireless sensor networks, one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D CNN)-based model was developed for automated recognition of occupant activity, and a data-efficient RL-based model was developed for indoor temperature control. The results showed that the proposed system could automatically control the indoor temperature in real time by reducing by 10.9% the thermal discomfort of the occupants with different thermal sensation characteristics and physical activities while maintaining their energy consumption. The proposed system could provide the ultimate occupant-centered indoor temperature control reflecting the dynamic and personalized characteristics of recent smart building control systems. Keywords Occupant activity Indoor environment control IoT sensors Reinforcement learning Deep learning 1 Introduction During the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the amount of time spent indoors has drastically increased [1,2]. The increase in time spent indoors has increased building energy consumption, which accounts for about 40% of total energy consumption despite global efforts to achieve the Carbon Emissions Reduction Target [3,4]. The growth in the indoor occupancy rate has also intensified the effect of indoor environment quality on the physical and mental health of building occupants [5,6]. Among the various elements of indoor environments, indoor temperature is considered as a major target of Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) control, which accounts for much of building energy consumption and is an important factor of the thermal comfort of building occupants [7]. Therefore, the development of an indoor temperature control system capable of improving thermal comfort while reducing building energy consumption has been growing in importance. Due to the recent advancement of smart building technologies, the paradigm of building control is rapidly changing from a static and uniform approach centered on buildings to a dynamic and personalized approach centered on building occupants [8]. As for the indoor temperature, the indoor thermal environment is affected by dynamic variables such as the outdoor environment and appliances in the indoor space [9]. In addition, the thermal sensation is different for each occupant, and the thermal comfort of each occupant varies depending on the occupant's physical activity [10]. Therefore, instead of conventional indoor temperature control methods such as arbitrary manual control by occupants [11], set-point temperature-based control [12], or fixed scheduling according to the building occupancy [13], occupant-centered indoor temperature control must be implemented, as it can reflect the dynamic and diversified characteristics of the indoor thermal environment to achieve both occupant thermal comfort and building energy efficiency. With such growing necessity, various studies have been conducted on occupant-centered indoor temperature control. Since each occupant has different thermal comfort zones and energy usage patterns, studies had sought to identify personalized thermal conditions and behaviors and reflect them in the indoor temperature control. To investigate and model the diversified thermal sensations of occupants, survey-based approaches and physiological measurements had been used. Alotaibi et al. [14] used a survey-based approach to determine the differences in the thermal sensations of occupants of hospitals according to their medical conditions and to examine the applicability of standard indoor thermal comfort models such as the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV). Ricciardi et al. [15] conducted more than 400 surveys to evaluate thermal discomfort in theaters through thermal stratification of occupants according to their location. Hwang et al. [16] surveyed 1294 people in a university in Taiwan on their optimal room temperature and selected the appropriate temperature. Various types of physiological sensors had also been used to capture the physiological response of occupants to various thermal conditions. Choi et al. [17] analyzed changes in the heart rate according to different physical activity levels and tried to use such changes to control thermal conditions. Kim et al. [18] proposed the possibility of indoor temperature control through the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal analysis. On the other hand, studies had also been conducted to predict and classify occupant-related variables such as occupant behavior and building occupancy in order to reduce energy consumption through indoor environment control. K-means clustering was used to categorize office occupancy schedules based on times of arrival and departure in order to efficiently control the operation of HVAC systems in office buildings [19]. Motuziene and Vilutiene [20] proposed four occupancy profiles based on the number and the age range of occupants and established a heating strategy for each profile, thus saving up to 31% energy. Sun et al. [21] evaluated cooling energy of an HVAC system by developing a stochastic model based on the overtime occupancy data of the office building. Dong and Lam [22] developed a nonlinear model predictive control system using models of weather and occupant behavior patterns that included the number of occupants and their occupancy duration. Overall, thermal sensation and behavior were diverse by occupant or occupant group and different energy usage patterns were investigated according to the building type and occupancy schedule. The investigated characteristics were used to generate adaptive thermal comfort models or occupancy profile models which were applied to establish HVAC control schedules using optimization algorithms or model predictive control algorithms. However, those studies considered only the presence of occupants as the occupant activity. Moreover, the investigated thermal conditions of occupants were general and static, which made it impossible to implement indoor environmental controls that immediately reflect the highly uncertain nature of the occupants and the indoor environment. Since the state of indoor environments consistently changes, the thermal comfort and energy usage of the occupants also continue to change. Therefore, for the ultimate occupant-centered indoor temperature control, studies were conducted to continuously monitor dynamic changes in occupants and indoor environments and to control the indoor temperature accordingly. Several studies had focused on automating the indoor temperature monitoring system and control the indoor temperature based on the monitored data. Sung et al. developed an indoor environment monitoring system through IoT sensors to control thermal comfort [23]. Temperature and humidity sensors had also been integrated with communication modules such as Zigbee for real-time energy management by setting the lower limit on temperature differences between two centers [24]. Still other studies had been conducted to predict the next state through the monitored occupant condition and the indoor environment, and to control the indoor environment using a rule-based algorithm or optimization. Li et al. used a smart wristband that collected physiological data such as the heart rate and the skin temperature to determine the thermal sensation via the fuzzy evaluation method, and the optimal temperature was determined using a linear adjustment algorithm [25]. Deng and Chen [26] successfully used an artificial neural network to develop an HVAC control system that improved thermal comfort by predicting thermal sensations based on physiological data measured by wristbands. Li et al. [27] proposed an HVAC control framework to predict thermal preference using wristbands and air monitoring devices, and control temperature based on the majority preference. As such, continuous monitoring using IoT sensors, wearable devices, and smart metering systems have made it possible to reflect the dynamic indoor environment and occupant state without continuous occupant feedback and to control the indoor environment in real time. A limitation, however, is that optimal indoor temperature control cannot be secured if a data prediction error occurs or if a rule-based algorithm is used. With the advancement of various deep learning algorithms, studies had been carried out using reinforcement learning (RL), which enables optimized real-time indoor temperature control using monitored data. Dalamagkidis et al. [28] developed an RL model based on four-year building simulation data and demonstrated that the model can achieve 25% energy savings over the traditional on/off controller. Fazenda et al. [29] proposed an RL model that would simultaneously optimize thermal comfort and energy consumption using a statistical model developed based on collected occupancy data. Valladares et al. [30] used the RL model with data on energy consumption and the indoor environment measured in real time by an IoT sensor to control thermal comfort within a comfort range. Zhang et al. [31] applied the developed RL model to the existing radiant heating system of an office building for 78 days and achieved 16.7% energy savings over the rule-based control system. Diyan et al. [32] used the RL-based method to adjust the schedule of air conditioners so as to minimize the discomfort of smart home users. Gao et al. [33] developed an RL model that can be applied to the dynamic thermal environment of buildings based on the ASHRAE RP-884 thermal comfort dataset [34]. In such studies, the proposed RL models that could control temperature immediately in response to changes in a dynamic indoor environment performed better than the traditional control system in terms of energy consumption and thermal comfort. In particular, Zhang [35] developed an RL-based real-time thermal environment control model that considers both personal thermal comfort and energy efficiency based on physiological data from a smart wristband. Such model enabled indoor temperature control to optimize personal thermal comfort and energy consumption in consideration of the dynamic states of indoor environments and occupants. However, in such studies, the various physical activities of the occupants that significantly affected their thermal comfort and energy consumption were not considered. In the meantime, as occupants perform various indoor physical activities under the influence of COVID-19, indoor environment control that reflects such diverse activities is essential in achieving ultimate personalized thermal comfort and efficient building energy consumption. Moreover, it was time-consuming and inefficient to collect a large amount of data on indoor environments, buildings, and each occupant during the long term to train RL models for real-world applications. To address the above limitations, this study aims to propose the Real-time Control system based on the Occupant-centered Monitoring For Optimal Room Temperature (Real-COMFORT) which optimizes individual thermal comfort and energy consumption. To that end, novel and intelligent real-time monitoring and control systems were constructed using wireless sensor networks (a smart wristband, a smart meter, and an IoT thermal environment monitoring device) and deep learning models based on climate chamber experiments. To overcome the limitation of the previously proposed RL-based indoor temperature control systems in which the occupant activity was not considered, one-dimensional convolutional neural network-based (1D CNN-based) model was developed for automated recognition of occupant activity using the acceleration data from the smart wristband (i.e., seated, walking, and handling 50 kg load) as input variables for indoor temperature control. By reflecting the occupant activity as an input with other physiological data that represent the dynamic characteristics of each occupant, the proposed system can enhance the thermal comfort of each occupant compared to the system that does not consider the occupant activity. In addition, the data-efficient RL-based indoor temperature control model was developed to address the issue of the data collection period and size by using a stochastic environment. Based on the stochastic environment application, the RL-based model could be trained only by using less than 4 h of experiment data for each occupant. As a result, the proposed system could provide automated optimal indoor temperature control maximizing personalized thermal comfort and energy conservation for occupants when performing dynamic activities. 2 Materials and method To develop Real-COMFORT, this study was conducted in three stages. First, data on thermal comfort, physiological data, acceleration data, and energy consumption data were collected according to the occupant activity at various temperatures through a climate chamber experiment. Second, a 1D CNN-based model was developed to automatically recognize the occupant activity using the collected acceleration data. Finally, the data-efficient RL model was developed to control the indoor temperature so as to optimize thermal comfort and energy consumption. 2.1 System configuration The proposed Real-COMFORT automatically controls the indoor temperature, optimizing both individual thermal comfort and energy consumption based on real-time data while the occupant is in the indoor environment. The proposed system consists of a monitoring system and a control system (refer to Fig. 1 ). In the monitoring system, the occupant, the indoor environment, and the energy consumption data are collected in real time through a wireless sensor network. The occupant data are collected using a wristband that can wirelessly collect personalized data including both physiological data and acceleration data. The collected data are stored in the local server via Bluetooth. The indoor environment data which are indoor temperature and relative humidity are saved to a cloud server by a commercial IoT sensor. The data uploaded to the cloud server are stored in the local server through Application Programming Interfaces. The energy consumption data are collected using a smart energy submeter and stored in the local server through a Wi-Fi connection. In the control system, the deep learning models and the data stored in the server are used to automatically recognize occupant activity and control indoor temperature. The 1D CNN-based model is used to recognize the physical activity of an occupant using acceleration data, while the RL model that can determine the optimal temperature according to the physiological response and the physical activity of the occupant is used in the indoor temperature control task. The 1D CNN-based model and the RL model are trained separately for each occupant, and the personalized models are stored in the local server. Then, the optimal temperature determined by running the stored personalized model is transmitted to the HVAC system through the MODBUS protocol connection to control the indoor temperature. The parameters for indoor temperature control were set as follows. The minimum unit of the temperature control was set at 1 °C, as in the general temperature control mode [30]. The available range of the indoor temperature was set at 18\u201328 °C according to the thermal comfort range suggested by ASHRAE standard 55 (20.5\u201325.5 °C in winter and 24.5\u201328.0 °C in summer) and the recommended indoor temperature standard in Korea (18\u201320 °C in winter and 26\u201328.0 °C in summer) [36,37]. The temperature control cycle of Real-COMFORT was set at a minimum cycle of 2 min to reflect the time for temperature control and the time for the human body to perceive thermal comfort during temperature changes [38]. To consider an occupant who stays in various types of indoor spaces in the short term, Real-COMFORT was designed to optimize thermal comfort and energy consumption based on the minimum unit of space usage time (1 h) in most of daily life and based on policies on working hours, training hours, and break times [39]. 2.2 Data collection experiment in a climate chamber A climate chamber experiment was conducted to collect the data for training and evaluation of the deep learning models developed in this study. Thus, data on the occupant, the indoor environment, the energy consumption, and the thermal sensation of the experiment subjects were collected while the subjects performed different physical activities at different temperatures. 2.2.1 Experimental setup The experiments were performed from June 4th to 25th, 2021 in the climate chamber at Yonsei University in Seoul, South Korea. The climate chamber (2.8 × 3.9 × 2.4 m3) has one door and no window. The temperature of the climate chamber can be kept between 10 °C and 80 °C, and its humidity, between 10% and 80% RH. The experiment was conducted in a general indoor environment that consisted of a desk and a chair. The relative humidity was designed to be 30\u201360%, which is the ideal indoor humidity level recommended by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, and the air velocity was designed to be 0.01 ± 0.05 m/s so that it could be less than 0.2 m/s, which is the appropriate indoor air velocity according to the ASHRAE standard 55 [36]. In the previous studies that measured personalized comfort in a climate chamber, experiments were conducted on small sample sizes of 2\u201312 experimental subjects [40\u201344]. In this study, to conduct the comparative analysis according to the different thermal sensations and energy usage patterns, four subjects with ages that ranged from 25 to 28 (mean value: 26.2, standard deviation: 1.17) were selected for the experiment. All the subjects were asked to have more than 7 h of sleep and to refrain from drinking alcohol and caffeinated beverages for 12 h before the experiment. The subjects were required to wear summer clothes such as trousers and a short-sleeved t-shirt, and clothing insulation was fixed at 0.57 clo calculated according to the ASHRAE standard 55 [36]. 2.2.2 Experiment design In the chamber experiment, the design variables were the indoor temperature and the type of occupant activity. As for the indoor temperature, to develop the data-efficient RL model in this study, the experiment was performed at five temperatures (18, 21, 23, 25, and 28 °C) within the indoor temperature standard range (18\u201328 °C) with reference to other studies that investigated the physiological effects of the indoor thermal environment [40,45,46]. As for the occupant activity, the subjects were required to perform the following three types of activities based on the ASHRAE standard 55: (i) seated, (ii) walking, and (iii) handling 50 kg load [36]. The metabolic rates of the activities were sedentary, medium, and high-intensity (i.e., 1.1, 2.0, and 4.0, respectively), and these activities are actions that an occupant can perform without any skills [37]. The climate chamber experiment consisted of a total of 15 sessions with three types of activities at five different temperatures (refer to Fig. 2 ). Thus, three sessions with different types of activities were conducted at a single temperature. To reach a steady state when the occupants performed each activity, each session lasted 10 min [47]. To avoid thermal comfort changes due to the previous activity, all the subjects were required to take a rest for 5 min before participating in each session so that they could enter a neutral thermal condition. They were also required to perform the activities from a low intensity to a high intensity in the metabolic rate (order of seated \u2013 walking \u2013 handling 50 kg load) in order to prevent the effect of the thermal comfort felt during the course of an activity immediately after the previous activity [48]. To be similar with in real-life situations, the subjects performed each activity without precise restrictions. For example, some subjects sat in silence while looking at their smartphones or sat with their legs crossed. 2.2.3 Data measurement Three types of data were measured with different monitoring devices during the climate chamber experiment: (i) indoor environment data measured with indoor environmental quality (IEQ) monitoring devices, (ii) occupant data measured with a smart wristband, and (iii) energy consumption data measured with a smart energy submeter. In addition, the thermal sensations of each subject were measured to evaluate thermal comfort. First, the indoor temperature and the relative humidity, which are the indoor environment data, were measured by AWAIR Omni, an IoT device for IEQ monitoring [49]. The ASHRAE standard 55 recommends that an IEQ monitoring device be placed in the middle of a room when the occupancy distribution is not accurately measured [36]. Therefore, the IEQ monitoring device was placed on a desk in the middle of the room at a height of 0.6 m from the floor. Both the indoor temperature and the relative humidity were measured every 10 s. Second, the occupant data, which included their physiological data (i.e., heart rate and skin temperature) and acceleration data, were measured using the E4 band that offers real-time data monitoring functions via Bluetooth [50]. The sampling rates of the E4 band were 1 Hz for the heart rate, 4 Hz for the skin temperature, and 32 Hz for the triaxial (i.e., x-, y-, and z-axis) acceleration data. For the physiological data, the average value for 10 s was used to match the same measurement cycle of the indoor environment data. On the other hand, raw data were used for the acceleration data as they were used to recognize occupant activity. Third, the energy consumption data in the climate chamber according to temperature control were measured using the smart energy submeter ENERTALK, which can measure them every 10 s [51]. The energy consumption was measured at a heating and cooling temperature range of 18\u201328 °C. The results showed that the energy consumed to increase the temperature by 1 °C was 133.4 Wh on average, whereas the energy consumed to decrease the temperature by 1 °C was 258.7 Wh on average. Finally, thermal comfort was evaluated by measuring the thermal sensation of each subject. In this study, the 13-point thermal sensation vote (TSV) including median values (i.e., −2.5, −1.5, −0.5, 0.5, 1.5, and 2.5) with the ASHRAE 7-point thermal sensation scale of Hot (+3), Warm (+2), Slightly warm (+1), Neutral (0), Slightly cold (−1), Cool (−2), and Cold (−3) was used to measure the thermal sensation of each subject in greater detail [52]. The TSV was recorded at 2-min intervals (i.e., five votes for each session), which is the temperature control cycle of Real-COMFORT. 2.3 1D CNN-based occupant activity recognition As occupants perform various types of physical activities, their thermal comfort zone varies due to the change in their metabolic rate. Therefore, in this study, 1D CNN-based occupant activity recognition model was developed for automated classification of the occupant activities based on the accelerometer data collected using the wristband. The 1D CNN-based model, with its relatively few parameters, enabled a real-time process [53]. Moreover, it showed a more accurate recognition result for classification and prediction tasks using time-series data such as acceleration data and natural language, unlike other machine learning algorithms such as support vector machine (SVM), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), and recurrent neural networks (RNN) [54,55]. Therefore, the 1D CNN-based occupant activity recognition model was designed to classify the defined three types of activity every 2 min, and the classification result was used as the input for the following RL-based indoor temperature control model. 2.3.1 Data preprocessing In the 1D CNN-based occupant activity recognition model, the input data are the channel-length data. Therefore, to transform the continuous data into channel-length data consisting of the acceleration data of the x, y, and z axes (i.e., three channels) for n time steps (i.e., n lengths) at the current time step s, the acceleration data from s-n+1 to s were considered as a single input datum. In previous studies that used accelerometer data from the wristband, n was chosen to cover 1\u20135 s of the activity [56\u201358]. In this study, 96 (i.e., 3 s) was empirically chosen as n. On the other hand, the inclusion of the physiological data with the acceleration data as the input data was tested, however, the recognition performance was not improved. As a result, 96,000 channel-length input data were constructed from the 32Hz triaxial acceleration data for 3000 s (i.e., 5 sessions of 10 min each for each occupant activity) for each type of activity of a single occupant. Particularly, all acceleration data were normalized to be between −1 and 1 to eliminate biases before being input into the occupant activity recognition model. 2.3.2 Model architecture The developed 1D CNN-based occupant activity recognition model consists of four 1D convolutional layers, one max-pooling layer, and two fully connected layers. Table 1 shows the detailed architecture of the developed model. The triaxial acceleration data of x, y, and z component signals for 96 time steps were the input vector of the model. Thus, the dimensions of the input vector were 3 × 96 . The input vector was entered into the first 1D convolutional layer that had a kernel size of 128 × 16 . The 1D convolutional layer generates the next feature map by performing the convolution operation using a kernel that slides in the length direction toward the feature map composed of the length and the channel (refer to Fig. 3 ). The max pooling layer is located between the first and second 1D convolutional layers. The feature map generated by going through the max pooling layer and three convolutional layers is concatenated into the feature vectors of one dimension to be entered in the fully connected layer. The concatenated feature vectors go through two fully connected layers and the softmax layer before being outputted as the probabilities of three types of occupant activity. In each 1D convolution layer and fully connected layer, the ReLU function was applied as an activation function. Since the temperature control cycle of Real-COMFORT was 2 min, the occupant activity recognition result was finalized every 2 min as well. Therefore, the outputs of the 1D CNN-based occupant activity recognition model were counted by class for the past 2-min acceleration data. Then, the occupant activity with the greatest number of counted classification results among the classes was determined as the finalized occupant activity. 2.3.3 Model training The hyperparameters for training the 1D CNN-based model were empirically set as follows. The cross-entropy loss was used as a loss function, and the learning rate started at 0.01 and decreased at certain steps. The batch size and epoch were set at 32 and 30, respectively. 2.4 Data-efficient RL-based indoor temperature control The RL-based model was developed for real-time optimal control of indoor temperature considering dynamic factors such as the physiological response and activities of the occupant in different indoor environments. In this study, a stochastic environment, which has random observed variables, was introduced to efficiently train the RL model with the use of a small number of data collected in a short time [59]. 2.4.1 Reinforcement learning model design The RL model can be designed using the Markov Decision Process (MDP), which consists of the state, action, transition probability, and reward ( S , A , P , R ) [60\u201362]. Therefore, the MDP was defined to solve the optimization problem (personalized control of indoor temperature optimizing both thermal comfort and energy consumption). First, the state ( S ) was defined as the current situation, which can be observed through sensors, including factors related to the occupant's thermal comfort and energy consumption. Therefore, along with the metabolic rate of the occupant activity recognized using the 1D CNN-based model, the average indoor temperature and two physiological data (i.e., the heart rate and the skin temperature) for the past 2 min constituted the state. To implement the optimization based on 1 h, the time spent in the indoor environment was added to configure a total of five variables as the state. Particularly, all variables were normalized to reduce the possibility that each element of the state would fall into the local optimum [63]. Second, the action ( A ) was defined as the change in the indoor temperature. The boundary of action was set as the maximum controllable range (i.e., −3 °C\u20133 °C) within 2 min in the climate chamber. At the same time, the boundary was set to prevent the changed temperature from exceeding the defined available indoor temperature range of the proposed system (18\u201328 °C). Third, the transition probability ( P ) is the probability of what will happen to the next state when a specific action is taken in the state [64]. In this study, the indoor temperature was deterministically designed according to the action of the RL model to change the temperature. On the other hand, the physiological data and the metabolic rate were designed to be stochastic in order to solve the problem of few data samples and to reflect uncertainties. Fourth, the reward ( R ) is defined as a weighted-sum multi-objective reward function composed of the TSV of the occupant and the energy consumed according to the temperature control was configured to consider both thermal comfort and energy consumption. Therefore, TSV was replaced with the predicted percentage of dissatisfied (PPD) index to express the thermal discomfort felt by the occupants as an absolute value (refer to Eq. (1)) [65]. In addition, normalization was used to allow the PPD and energy consumption to have similar scales. As a result, an optimization weight parameter ( w ) with a range of 0\u20131 was set to create a reward function that considers both thermal comfort and energy consumption in a trade-off relationship (refer to Eq. (2)). This reward function performs the optimization focused on thermal comfort when the weight parameter is close to 0, and focused on energy consumption when the weight parameter is close to 1. (1) P P D = 100 − 95 ∗ e ( − 0.03353 ∗ T S V 4 − 0.02179 ∗ T S V 2 ) (2) R = 1 − w ∗ P P D n o r m + w ∗ E C n o r m where TSV is the predicted mean vote, PPD is the predicted percentage of dissatisfied, R is the reward of the RL model, w is the optimization weight parameter between thermal comfort and energy consumption, and P P D n o r m and E C n o r m are the normalized PPD and energy consumption, respectively. Based on the established MDP, the RL algorithm was used for the optimization. In this study, a soft-actor-critic (SAC) algorithm was used as a kind of mixed version of an actor-critic method [66] for data efficiency and a policy-based method [67] for stable convergence that compensates for the disadvantages of both the value-based method [68] (refer to Eq. (3)). Compared to the basic actor-critic method, the optimal policy of SAC becomes not deterministic but stochastic action selection since the softmax function is applied to the policy function ( π ). Moreover, the entropy term ( H ) was introduced to the policy with an entropy regularization coefficient ( α ), which led to the avoidance of the sub-optimal solution by overestimating the weak policy and giving it an opportunity to do a variety of actions (refer to Eq. (4)). For example, as α increases, the probability that all actions will be selected equally increases; and if α is 0, it indicates conventional RL. As a result, SAC could further improve the data efficiency and performance compared to the existing actor-critic method [69]. Therefore, in this study, model training was effectively performed using the limited data obtained from the climate chamber experiment. (3) q π s , a = E R t + 1 + γ q π s ' , a ' | S t = s , A t = a (4) π ∗ = a r g m a x π E π ∑ t = 0 T γ t R t + α H t π where q is the value function; S t , A t , and r t are state, action, and reward at the time step t ∈ [ 0 , T ] , respectively; π is the policy that defines the way of action; γ ∈ [ 0,1 ] is the discount factor that discounts the sum of future rewards; and H and α are the entropy term and the entropy regularization coefficient, respectively. 2.4.2 Establishment of stochastic environment for data-efficient RL A stochastic environment was implemented to efficiently train the RL model using the limited data collected from the data collection experiment. The stochastic environment is an environment where there is unknown observable randomness, in which the action of RL does not deterministically determine the next state. It is used for control tasks in the real world, where uncertainty exists [70,71]. In this study, the stochastic elements included (i) the stochastic dataset on the physiological data and TSV, and (ii) the stochastic activity schedule included the sequence of occupant activities. The physiological data and the TSV of the occupant are depending on the indoor temperature and the activity. Therefore, for the physiological data and the TSV of the occupant, a stochastic dataset was created by applying linear interpolation based on the measured data. On the other hand, the activity is determined by the occupant. Therefore, a stochastic activity schedule that represented the sequence of the activity that occupant could choose for an hour was created so that the RL can learn the diverse possible sequences of the activities. First, the stochastic dataset consisted of two types of data: (i) the measured data in the data collection experiment (ii) and the synthetic data generated based on the measured data. The measured data was based on the physiological data and the TSV at a measured temperature (i.e., 18, 21, 23, 25, and 28 °C), while the synthetic data which were data at an unmeasured temperature (i.e., 19, 20, 22, 24, 26, or 27 °C) were generated by applying the linear interpolation (refer to Fig. 4 ). The linear interpolation was conducted for two of the measured data points randomly selected at the near two sides of the temperature (i.e., one data point for each side). For instance, to create the synthetic data of which the activity was \u2018seated\u2019 and the indoor temperature was 26 °C, linear interpolation was applied for one of the data points randomly selected respectively at the 25 °C and 28 °C in the same activity. The stochastic dataset was built by repeating this process as many times as the number of data points at each occupant activity and indoor temperature. Second, the stochastic activity schedule included the sequence of activities and their starting indoor temperature (refer to Fig. 4). Since the optimization period of Real-COMFORT is 1 h and a single activity is performed for 10 min, the activity schedule consisted of six randomly selected activities. Meanwhile, the starting indoor temperature was randomly selected from a temperature range of 18\u201328 °C. Based on the stochastic dataset and the activity schedule, the stochastic environment in the RL-based model was applied as follows: (i) one of the activity schedules was selected; (ii) one of the physiological data corresponding to the indoor temperature and the occupant activity was randomly selected from the stochastic dataset; (iii) the indoor temperature, the metabolic rate of the occupant activity, and the action were determined based on the physiological data; (iv) the next indoor temperature changes according to the determined action and the activity were determined based on the activity schedule; and (v) (ii) to (iv) were repeated (refer to Fig. 5 ). 2.4.3 Model training The hyperparameters for training the RL model were set through trial and error, as follows. The gamma factor was set at 0.99. The batch size and the buffer limit were set at 32 and 50,000, respectively, and the iteration was set at 25,000. The learning rate of both the actor network and the critic network was set at 0.05. The smoothing coefficient, which helps slightly change the policy update, was set at 0.005. The entropy regularization coefficient was fixed at 0.01 and used in the same way as in Ref. [66]. 3 Model evaluation and system implementation 3.1 1D CNN-based model evaluation In this evaluation, the performance of the developed 1D CNN-based occupant activity recognition model was validated. Since it was important to test each trained model of each subject for validating the proposed framework to train models with the limited experimental data, four 1D CNN-based models were trained and tested on each subject. Therefore, the channel-length acceleration data of each occupant constructed in 2.3.1 were divided into the training and test datasets. To establish the training and test datasets, the channel-length data were divided based on the 25 sub-sessions between 2 min, the period in which the TSV was responded by the subject, for each type of activity. To prevent the training and test datasets from containing similar data, the data collected in a sub-session were assigned only to the training dataset or the test dataset. Therefore, 17 of the 25 sub-sessions were randomly selected to establish the training dataset, and the rest of the data for the eight sub-sessions were used as test data for each subject. To compare the performance of the 1D CNN-based occupant activity recognition models, the accuracy of the classification of all the data and by sub-session were compared. 3.2 RL model evaluation in the stochastic environment Evaluation in a stochastic environment was performed to confirm the robustness of the developed RL model and find the optimal model. The developed RL models with different input variables and optimization weight parameters were trained and tested in the stochastic environment, respectively. As a result, the hourly thermal comfort and energy consumption trends when different models were used were evaluated. The optimization weight parameter between thermal comfort and energy consumption was analyzed, and based on the evaluation result, appropriate input variables were selected. The optimization weight parameter was applied to the RL model by changing its value from 0.1 to 0.9 in units of 0.1. Meanwhile, the optimization results obtained from cases when the metabolic rate of the recognized occupant activity was used and not used as an input variable were compared, after which appropriate input variables were selected for the RL control model. 3.3 Testbed implementation of the system To validate the effectiveness and performance of the developed Real-COMFORT, a testbed experiment was conducted in the climate chamber for each subject wearing the same clothes (i.e., trousers and a short-sleeved shirt), as in the data collection experiment. Three occupant activities were randomly arranged twice and organized in the following order: (walking \u2013 handling 50 kg load \u2013 seated \u2013 handling 50 kg load \u2013 walking \u2013 seated). Each activity lasts for 10 min during the experiment same as the data collection experiment. As a result, 1 h experiment was conducted for each subject to evaluate the developed system. In addition, the TSV to evaluate the performance in terms of thermal comfort was collected in every 2 min after the temperature control. To analyze the thermal comfort and energy consumption after applying the developed system, two comparative indoor temperature control methods used in real cases were compared in the same activity schedule and experimental environment: (i) set-point control, which is used for public buildings (i.e., schools and libraries) and government offices where occupants can control the temperature between 26 °C and 28 °C, which is the recommended standard in summer; and (ii) manual control, which is used in residential or commercial buildings where occupants freely control the temperature between 18 °C and 30 °C. In both experiments, the subjects were asked to control the indoor temperature to maximize their thermal comfort every 2 min. 4 Results and discussion 4.1 Performance evaluation of 1D CNN-based occupant activity recognition The accuracy of the occupant activity recognition using the 1D CNN-based model on the test datasets of each subject was evaluated. Table 2 shows the classification accuracy for all the constructed test datasets before the classification results were finalized, and Table 3 shows the classification accuracy of the finalized result in 2-min sub-session units. The recognition results for all the test datasets showed that the classification accuracy was above 85% for all the subjects. In terms of the type of occupant activity, the accuracy of \u2018walking\u2019 or \u2018handling 50 kg load\u2019 was the lowest. This is because the movement of the wrist when \u2018walking\u2019 was similar to that when \u2018handling 50 kg load\u2019, given that the accuracy of \u2018walking\u2019 and \u2018handling 50 kg load\u2019 was lower than that of \u2018seated,\u2019 except for subject 1. The classification accuracy in the experiment sub-session units was higher than that for all the test datasets. Particularly, in the data for subject 3, the activities were properly classified in all the experiment sessions. However, in the data for subjects 1, 2, and 4, the given occupant activity was incorrectly classified as \u2018walking\u2019 or \u2018handling 50 kg load\u2019 in the session for \u2018seated.\u2019 In these sessions, the movement of the wrist frequently occurred due to the subjects' activities such as operating a mobile phone or winging the arms while being seated. For instance, as shown in Fig. 6 , although in sub-sessions 3 and 5 of subject 1, the subject was \u2018seated,\u2019 the sub-session 5 activity was classified as \u2018handling 50 kg load.\u2019 Nevertheless, all but one sub-session out of a total of 24 sub-sessions exhibited true-positive results with more than 95% accuracy. Overall, the performance of the 1D CNN developed in this study could achieve high accuracy while processing data in real time. However, the use of accelerometer data collected from the wristband can yield wrong classification results when wrist movement occurs while the occupant is seated in everyday life. Nevertheless, in this study, since the classification accuracy in the session units was higher than 95%, the occupant activity could be accurately recognized in more than 28.5 cycles out of 30 cycles when Real-COMFORT with a control cycle of 2 min was applied to the indoor temperature control for 1 h. Thus, an input variable for the RL-based indoor temperature control could be automatically entered using a 1D CNN-based occupant activity recognition model. 4.2 Performance evaluation of RL-based indoor temperature control in the stochastic environment 4.2.1 Analysis of the measured real-data and generated stochastic data To validate the RL-based model by using a stochastic environment, the measured real data and the synthetic data generated on the TSV as well as the physiological data of each subject were analyzed. First, the measured and generated TSV data are shown in Fig. 7 . Because the TSV was collected as one value for each indoor temperature and physical activity in the data collection experiment, the generated TSV was also generated as one value for each indoor temperature and physical activity. The TSV showed a tendency to increase as the indoor temperature and the metabolic rate rose, which is consistent with the statistical analysis results in other studies [72\u201374]. On the other hand, the thermal sensation showed different patterns for each subject. For subject 1, there was a section where the change in the thermal sensation was not significant in all the occupant activities. Particularly at 21 °C, the TSV was 0 in all the activities. Even in the case of subject 2, there was a section in which the change in the thermal sensation was insignificant. On the other hand, subjects 3 and 4 exhibited few sections where the TSV was close to 0 and the thermal sensitivity was high. In addition, the overall preferred temperature was low. Overall, the measured data and the generated data on each subject showed a non-linear pattern according to temperature. Since linear interpolation can reflect different thermal sensations that change with temperature for each subject, the synthetic data on TSV that were generated using linear interpolation were found to be valid, as in Ref. [75]. Second, the measured and generated heart rate data, and the measured and generated skin temperature data are shown in Fig. 8 . As in the previous studies, the heart rate showed a nonlinear relationship with indoor temperature [76], and the skin temperature showed a linear relationship with temperature except for subject 3 [77]. However, the measurement results for the heart rate and the skin temperature varied depending on the subject, as in the case of the TSV, and there was a large deviation in the data even when the same subject performed the same activity at the same temperature. Therefore, those uncertainties could be considered by generating stochastic data using linear interpolation between two randomly extracted nearby data points. Meanwhile, the maximum, minimum, and average values of the generated physiological data were located between the maximum, minimum, and average values of the real data measured at neighboring temperatures, and were not biased. Therefore, it was confirmed that the generated stochastic physiological data could reflect the characteristics of the physiological responses of individual subjects while following general trends. 4.2.2 Comparative analysis for determining the optimal RL model Fig. 9 shows the average hourly PPD and energy consumption of all the subjects according to the optimization weight parameters when RL model 1 (i.e., where both the physiological data and the metabolic rate were used as the input variables) and RL model 2 (i.e., where only the physiological data were used as the input variables without the metabolic rate) were used with the 3000 test datasets. According to the optimization weight parameters, the results showed a trade-off relationship between the PPD and energy consumption. In addition, the pareto front of RL model 1 was located on the lower right of the pareto front of RL model 2. This suggests that in terms of bi-objective optimization, RL model 1 showed better optimization performance for thermal comfort and energy consumption than RL model 2. In addition, for RL model 1, the optimization weight parameter from 0.4, where the hourly PPD and energy consumption were 8.8% and 2.83 kWh, respectively, to 0.7, where the hourly PPD and energy consumption were 9.8% and 1.76 kWh, respectively, can be selected for balanced control between the PPD and energy consumption. When comparing the RL model 1 and the RL model 2 of each subject, the pareto front of RL model 1 was located on the lower right of the pareto front of RL model 2 in all the subjects (refer to Fig. 10 ). Particularly, when the energy consumption values of the two models were similar, the hourly PPD of RL model 1 was lower than that of RL model 2, which indicates better optimization of the thermal comfort of the occupant. As a result, the minimum hourly PPD in RL model 1 was at least 0.1% of PPD (i.e., 7.2%) lower in subject 1 and up to 7.1% of PPD (i.e., 50.3%) lower in subject 3 than in RL model 2. Particularly for subject 3, where the skin temperature data were different from the general trend, the optimization performance of RL model 1 was further improved from that of RL model 2. These results indicate that the use of only physiological data, except for the metabolic rate, as input variables made it difficult to optimize the personalized thermal comfort. This was due to the underfitted training of the RL model, because the physiological response of the subject had a large deviation even when the subject performed the same activity at the same temperature, as shown in the data analysis results in section 4.2.1. Overall, RL model 1 showed better pareto front results for thermal comfort and energy consumption than RL model 2 in various stochastic environments. Therefore, although the trade-off relation differed because the thermal comfort zone varied from person to person, due to which the energy consumption also differed [78], personalized control to maximize thermal comfort with limited energy consumption was possible when the developed RL-based indoor temperature control was applied. As a result, Real-COMFORT could obtain more robust and improved optimization results compared to previously proposed RL-based indoor temperature control systems which only considered the physiological data without considering the occupant activities [35]. 4.3 Comparative analysis of Real-COMFORT in the testbed implementation experiment The developed Real-COMFORT was implemented in the testbed and compared with the existing set-point control and manual control in terms of the hourly PPD and energy consumption (refer to Fig. 11 ). The set-point control was where the minimum boundary of the indoor temperature was defined as 26 °C, at which 32.7% of the hourly PPD occurred instead when energy was not used in the experiments with all the subjects. In particular, the PPD was especially high in subjects 3 and 4 who had narrow thermal comfort zones and low preferred temperatures, as stated in the analysis in section 4.2.1. Meanwhile, the comparison of Real-COMFORT and manual control revealed that the difference in the hourly PPD and the energy consumption varied widely for each subject. Subjects 1 and 4 showed improved results for both the energy consumption and the thermal comfort of the occupants, as Real-COMFORT exhibited a lower PPD and energy consumption than the manual control. On the other hand, for subject 2, the energy consumption was lower with Real-COMFORT than with the manual control, but the PPD was higher with Real-COMFORT. On the contrary, for subject 3, the energy consumption was higher but the PPD was lower with Real-COMFORT. Specifically, the subjects who showed a higher PPD in the set-point control (subjects 3 and 4) showed higher energy consumption than the others in Real-COMFORT and the manual control. Comprehensively, the average hourly PPD of all the subjects using Real-COMFORT was 8.3%, and using manual control, 9.2%. Thus, the thermal discomfort was 10.9% lower in Real-COMFORT, but the average energy consumption values were the same at 1.77 kWh. Despite in the manual control, the subjects were asked to control the indoor temperature to maximize their thermal comfort, it was validated that Real-COMFORT could not only automatically control indoor temperature but also improved thermal comfort using the same amount of energy. The records of the indoor temperature control and the TSV for each subject were compared to examine the detailed difference between the proposed Real-COMFORT and the manual control (refer to Fig. 12 ). The comparison results confirmed that the change in temperature was greater, and the cycle of temperature change was more frequent, from the case of subject 1 who had a wide thermal comfort zone to the case of subject 4 who had a narrow thermal comfort zone. As for subject 1, when the subject performed various activities, the TSV was 0 or 0.5 even though the temperature did not change significantly. Consequently, Real-COMFORT succeeded in reducing energy consumption while maintaining an acceptable thermal comfort, as it did not lower the indoor temperature further than in the manual control. As for subject 2, energy consumption was reduced by not lowering the indoor temperature, as for subject 1, but the thermal comfort was worse than when manual control was applied. As for subjects 3 and 4, when Real-COMFORT and manual control were applied, the change in temperature was larger and the cycle of temperature change was more frequent than for subjects 1 and 2. In this case, Real-COMFORT achieved better thermal comfort than manual control. This suggests that because it takes time for people to exactly recognize their thermal sensations, thermal comfort cannot be sufficiently achieved when manual control is used. Therefore, it is expected that when Real-COMFORT is used, thermal comfort can be achieved preemptively via immediate and efficient control for dynamic occupant activities and indoor environments. Overall, the use of the 1D CNN-based model made it possible to implement an indoor temperature control system that reflects the occupant activity. In addition, the applicability of the data-efficient RL-based model trained in the stochastic environment in the real world was verified. The proposed system, Real-COMFORT, showed similar or better results for thermal comfort and energy consumption than the manual control, and maximized thermal comfort even when there were different thermal sensations and when the subjects performed various activities. Thus, Real-COMFORT enabled personalized indoor temperature control for each occupant. In particular, Real-COMFORT provided better thermal comfort than the manual control for occupants with high thermal sensitivity who performed dynamic activities. These results are inconsistent with the results of other papers that attempted to reduce energy consumption while maintaining thermal comfort when RL was used [33,35]. Particularly amidst the recent trend where various activities are performed in the personal space, Real-COMFORT enabled ultimate occupant-centered indoor temperature control by immediately reflecting the occupant activity along with the occupant's personalized thermal comfort. 5 Conclusion This study presented a novel real-time indoor temperature control system based on occupant-centered monitoring using deep learning algorithms (i.e., Real-COMFORT) to optimize individual occupant thermal comfort and energy consumption based on a climate chamber experiment. To consider the occupant activities that are important for indoor temperature control in order to achieve the ultimate thermal comfort of an individual occupant, a 1-dimensional convolutional neural networks-based (1D CNN-based) model was developed for automated recognition of occupant activity using acceleration data from a smart wristband. Moreover, a data-efficient reinforcement learning-based (RL-based) model was developed for real-time indoor temperature control by applying a stochastic environment to overcome the problem of data intensiveness. The results showed that based on the classification results of the 1D CNN-based model, the developed RL-based model reduced thermal discomfort by a maximum of 50.3% compared to the RL-based model without considering the occupant activities. In addition, by applying a stochastic environment, the RL-based model was trained using less than 4 h of experiment data. As a result, the proposed system reduced the occupant thermal discomfort by 10.9% while maintaining the energy consumption compared to the manual control by the occupants who were performing dynamic activities. Real-COMFORT could improve thermal comfort and energy efficiency for occupants with different thermal sensation characteristics by collecting limited data. Moreover, it could automatically and immediately reflect the occupant activity as well as the physiological response for optimized indoor temperature control. As a result, the proposed system could provide the ultimate occupant-centered indoor temperature control that satisfies the dynamic and personalized characteristics of recent smart building control systems. However, this study has some limitations within some findings that need to be interpreted carefully. First, the experiment was conducted in a single specific room while performing only three physical activities. Therefore, the proposed system can be further extended with continuous monitoring and feedback while performing various activities (e.g., different intensity of exercises, sleeping, and eating) in different rooms for application in actual buildings. In addition, it is necessary to investigate the optimal control when there are a group of occupants in one space, since the thermal comfort zones may conflict with each other. Second, this study was conducted with only 4 people of similar age. To achieve generalized results, experiment on subjects of various ages should be conducted in the future. Last but not least, in future studies, the proposed system can be extended by investigating other indoor environmental factors such as visual comfort and air quality, set as a control variable in this study, for application in existing buildings.

Based on chamber experiments with wireless sensor networks, one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D CNN)-based model was developed for automated recognition of occupant activity, and a data-efficient RL-based model was developed for indoor temperature control. The results showed that the proposed system could automatically control the indoor temperature in real time by reducing by 10.9% the thermal discomfort of the occupants with different thermal sensation characteristics and physical activities while maintaining their energy consumption. The proposed system could provide the ultimate occupant-centered indoor temperature control reflecting the dynamic and personalized characteristics of recent smart building control systems.",
