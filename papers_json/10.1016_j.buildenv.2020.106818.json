[61] are used in this study. \u2022 HVAC load: The HVAC system is a fan coil unit with an air-cooled chiller. In this study, the control variable to maintain the indoor comfort conditions is the indoor temperature and not the humidity. A boiler is used to increase the temperature in the heating mode; while an air-cooled chiller, consisting of a compressor, air-cooled condenser and evaporator, is used to decrease the temperature during the cooling mode. The normal heating and cooling set-points are 22 °C and 24 °C , respectively. The set-back temperatures are set to 18 °C and 28 °C during winter and summer seasons, respectively, for unoccupied periods for all zones according to the ASHRAE 90.1\u20132007 recommendations [62]. The simulated office has two zones. \u2022 Occupancy, lighting, and equipment loads: There are three occupants located at each zone of the open-plan office. The occupancy profiles representing the working schedules of each occupant are derived from real occupancy data collected from the shared office for one year. The lighting and equipment schedules follow the occupancy profiles in this study. According to Ref. [60], the office equipment power density is set to 11.77 (W/m2). Since the number of luminaires varies between zones, each zone has its own lighting power density as shown in Table 1.

Optimal management of buildings' energy-consuming systems is of great importance for minimizing building energy consumption while satisfying the occupants. Since the operation of building systems are highly dependent on the presence of occupants, considering the dynamic occupancy information has become crucial to reflect the occupancy dynamism within offices and the random patterns in occupant behavior. Thus, occupancy-centered control strategies are required in order to enhance the energy management of buildings. On the other hand, the need for localized and customizable comfort controls is increasing in office buildings to improve the occupants\u2019 satisfaction, and consequently their productivity. To this end, a framework aiming at developing optimal occupancy-centered local control strategies is proposed in this paper. A new simulation-based multi-objective optimization model of the energy consumption in offices is developed to exploit occupancy-related data and evaluate possible local control strategies to select the best ones. A set of real occupancy data collected over a period of one year is fed to the integrated simulation-based optimization model for investigating the energy-saving potentials. Comparing the results shows that a considerable improvement in the indoor comfort condition can be achieved through the application of the proposed framework. We conclude that optimal control strategies not only provide demand-driven control solutions but also optimize building energy performance. The integrated model enables dynamic building energy management according to dynamic occupancy patterns. It avoids over-conditioning that is the result of the application of common practices, which control building systems based on the peak occupancy. Keywords Energy management system Local control strategies Dynamic occupancy profiles Comfort Multi-objective optimization Simulation 1 Introduction and background In 2018, commercial buildings are reported to be responsible for around 18% of the total energy consumption in the United States and assumingly this share will increase around 6% by 2050 based on the AEO2019 Reference case [1]. Canada also reported an 11% share for commercial buildings in 2016 [2]. Without energy efficiency efforts, this energy use will dramatically increase. Furthermore, more than 80% of energy consumption happens during the operation phase of a building's life cycle [3,4]. Thus, optimal management of building operations is a promising way to reduce energy usage in buildings [5]. To provide better building operation and decrease energy consumption, different methods have been studied. This includes implementing intelligent control strategies to building energy-consuming systems, maintaining equipment for maximum efficiency, and increase the environmental awareness of the occupants. Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) and lighting systems are the prime targets for applying control strategies and energy consumption optimization as these systems account for 71% of the total energy use in commercial and institutional buildings in Canada and almost the same amount in the US [6\u20138]. Previous simulation-based research studies showed 10\u201360% energy savings from demand-driven HVAC operations [9\u201319] and similar savings due to the application of lighting control strategies [20\u201326]. Despite these studies, the application of local control is rare in the literature, especially when controlling HVAC systems. The efficient and intelligent management of complex buildings' energy demand and consumption is possible through Building Energy Management Systems (BEMSs) [27]. BEMSs aim to keep a trade-off between minimizing the energy cost and maximizing the occupants' satisfaction [28]. However, due to a lack of sufficient collected data and a proper connection between different types of data collected from different sources, current building control practices are unable to fully achieve the goal of optimized operation of buildings while maintaining thermal comfort. This means applying more cost-efficient strategies usually results in reducing the occupants' satisfaction and even productivity [29,30]. This clearly shows the dependency of building operations on occupancy information and the importance of its changes in the optimal building operation [31,32]. Therefore, the occupancy, as a paramount parameter in the evaluation of building energy consumption, should be considered as accurately as possible when dealing with the building operation and energy models. As a result, the research in this area is two-fold. Firstly, due to the vital impact of occupancy data on building operation, accurate occupancy prediction models should be developed to estimate the space utilization patterns. Secondly, control strategies should be generated based on the occupants\u2019 presence and preferences information. Having information regarding the space utilization patterns requires monitoring occupants for a reasonable period and collecting data at a proper resolution level. Post-processing procedures are then used to cleanse the raw data and model the occupancy profiles. The effect of space occupancy on building energy consumption can then be investigated using these profiles. To do so, most of the research studies used simulation to emulate the real behavior of building and its components (e.g., occupants). Occupancy-related parameters are highly dependent on the season, weather, time of the day, and occupants' habits [33]. Therefore, there is a need to consider the dynamism in occupancy profiles to reflect these dependencies [34,35]. However, currently, most of the occupancy profiles used in building energy simulation consider binary values of 0 and 1 showing the unoccupied and occupied states of the space, respectively. Although some diversity has been considered by using different deterministic schedules for workdays and weekends, all workdays are considered to have the same profile throughout the year [36]. This assumption disregards the important impact of the dynamic variations in occupants\u2019 profiles. Even when these variations are considered through the usage of probabilistic occupancy profiles, all days of a week are treated equally by using fixed pre-defined profiles [37\u201340]. This makes these occupancy profiles not mature enough for representing real occupancy patterns. In addition, generally, there is an inverse relationship between the energy consumption of operational systems and the comfort level of occupants using these systems. Occupants\u2019 preferences regarding the energy-consuming systems affect their energy consumption. On the other hand, changing the settings of these systems has an impact on how occupants feel about their surrounding conditions. As a result, finding a balance between these two important concepts is crucial to improve the building operation. Therefore, optimization methods are required to fully investigate all the possible different combinations of settings. Based on the above discussion, this paper aims to develop a new simulation-based multi-objective optimization model of energy consumption in open-plan offices based on dynamic occupancy profiles and occupants' preferences. Using a proper sensing technique to distinguish between different occupants in open-plan offices and detect occupancy patterns results in differentiating the temporal behavior of different occupants. Based on the derived occupancy information, an occupancy prediction model can be developed using different stochastic methods to predict future occupancy information [41]. Furthermore, the results of the prediction model have to be periodically corrected (e.g., every 30 min) based on the real-time locating systems (RTLS) data. However, the full integration of the prediction model with the simulation-based optimization model is beyond the scope of this paper. Instead, for the sake of simplicity, this paper uses real occupancy data as a proxy of the occupancy prediction results. As such, occupant-specific dynamic profiles are developed. Having the dynamic occupancy profiles along with the indoor environmental conditions, this study contributes to the exploration of solutions produced by the integration of a simulation model with a multi-objective optimization process. This integration eventually leads to the identification and application of the optimal local control strategies of the building energy-consuming systems. The objectives of this study are: (1) Developing high-resolution dynamic occupancy profiles based on RTLS data to represent temporal variations of occupancy patterns in open-plan offices; (2) Integrating the energy simulation model with the optimization algorithm to optimally control the building energy-consuming systems and to analyze the trade-off between buildings' energy consumption and occupants' comfort; and (3) Developing local control algorithms for building energy-consuming systems. These objectives aim at assisting decision-makers in evaluating optimized occupancy-centered building operations. The novelty of the proposed method is also related to the consideration of full-year real occupancy profiles with a high resolution of 1-min capturing the stochastic behavior of occupants in full. Thus, there are no typical occupancy patterns, rather each day has a unique occupancy profile resulting of fully exploiting occupancy data. This consideration coupled with detailed occupancy-centered building systems' operation and control is used to optimize building performance. Moreover, unlike other studies [18], building systems\u2019 schedules not only work based on the start and end times of occupancy but also, they follow occupancy patterns throughout the day. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses the proposed research methodology. Implementation and case study are explored in Section 3. Finally, the conclusions, limitations of the current research study, and future work are discussed in Section 4. 2 Research methodology 2.1 Overview In order to achieve the objectives of minimizing the building energy consumption as well as the occupants' discomfort hours, a detailed building energy simulation model should be developed and encapsulated within an optimization algorithm. Since the operation of building systems are highly dependent on the presence of occupants, the integrated model should select the most optimized settings for building systems based on the dynamic space occupancy information. Having reliable insight regarding the occupancy information is especially crucial when applying local control strategies in shared spaces. When applying local control of building systems, the modeled space should be divided into multiple zones to assign relevant dynamic occupancy information to each zone. The zoning is applied to consider the effect of (1) different types of activities performed in each zone; and (2) a different number of the HVAC terminal units as will be discussed in the following section [42]. In large open-plan offices occupied with multi occupants, the space should be divided into zones for the adaptation of the local control strategies [43,44]. In this study, the proposed methodology comprises two main modules: (1) simulation-based multi-objective optimization module and (2) occupancy module as illustrated in Fig. 1 . The processes required for each module are shown in this figure. Firstly, information regarding the space occupancy is obtained through the occupancy module. To do so, real occupancy data should be collected over a reasonable period using RTLSs within the occupancy module. The collected data are then processed and the derived information is imported to the simulation model as an indication of the real occupancy space utilization patterns. This information helps the model to better differentiate occupants in the monitored shared space. The next module, which is simulation-based multi-objective optimization, starts with developing a detailed simulation model to evaluate the energy performance of the building using the building and its energy-consuming systems\u2019 characteristics. Feeding the energy simulation model with the occupancy information, a simulation-based optimization problem is then solved to determine the values of the decision variables, which are the settings of the building energy-consuming systems. These values are calculated based on the problem objective functions. The output of this module is a file containing information pertinent to the local control of the building systems. 2.2 Occupancy module There are many types of information determining the accuracy of the dynamic occupancy profiles including the duration of the occupants' presence, their locations in different zones of a building, and their preferences. New RTLSs can provide the location and duration of presence while the preference data can be collected by a survey. The collected data are then processed using occupant data analytics (data processing) to derive the important occupancy features, such as the number of present occupants, periods of absence and presence, and other occasional variations in the occupants\u2019 profiles [41]. The procedure used to develop dynamic occupancy profiles is illustrated in Fig. 2 . In this figure, Z shows the total number of zones in the office. Since different resolution levels are required for controlling different building systems, as will be explained in Section 2.3.4, two models with two resolution levels of i and m ( i < m ) are required to produce dynamic occupancy profiles. The first set of profiles are generated using a high-resolution level of i minute (e.g., 1 min). For each day of a week ( d ) and for each hour ( n ) of the daily total occupncy time ( T O T d ), the zone status ( S t a t u s z , i ) at time-step i is derived from the collected data at each zone ( z ). In addition, the duration at which the zone is occupied ( t o c c ) is recorded and compared with the unoccupied duration ( t u o c c ). In this way, the status of the zone z during each m time-step ( S t a t u s z , m ) will be determined based on comparing t o c c and t u o c c and selecting the bigger value. The zone occupancy ratio ( O c c R z , m ) is calculated by dividing the summation of the number of occupants who occupied the zone during each i minute within the m time-step by the total number of occupants assigned to that zone ( T O T z , o c c ). The derived occupancy profiles are used as a basis for the development of occupants-centric local control strategies as explained in Section 2.3.4. These profiles can distinguish between different occupants' schedules and habits by capturing their temporal behavior. Dynamic occupancy profiles not only enable the application of schedule-based local control of building systems but also reflect the stochastic nature of occupants\u2019 schedules in the simulation model. This would help to effectively analyze the energy performance of the building under uncertainties. 2.3 Simulation-based multi-objective optimization module As mentioned in Section 1, the optimal operation of building energy-consuming systems is dependent on finding a balance between their energy cost and the occupants\u2019 satisfaction. The developed optimization and simulation models are respectively explained in detail in Sections 2.3.1 and 2.3.2, followed by a description of the integration of two models in Section 2.3.3. Local control strategies are also discussed in Section 2.3.4. 2.3.1 Optimization model The mathematical representation of the optimization algorithm is expressed as follows: (1) arg min F ( X ) = [ D C ( X ) , E ( X ) ] X ∈ R n S u b j e c t t o g ( X ) where X ∈ R n is the optimal decision variables vector, and F ( X ) = [ D C ( X ) , E ( X ) ] is the vector of the discomfort ( D C ) and energy ( E ) objective functions. g ( X ) is the vector of the constraint functions that could consider the regulations and the occupants' preferences regarding the HVAC and lighting systems' settings. The inputs to the optimization model are the sensory data as well as the information from the occupancy module. These inputs are the environmental conditions (i.e., the HVAC and lighting systems' settings), occupants' preferences and their dynamic profiles. In this study, cooling and heating set-points for each zone along with the illuminance level of each zone are the optimization decision variables. Minimizing discomfort hours (all clo), which is the total discomfort hours when winter or summer clothes are worn [45] and minimizing energy consumption are the ultimate goals of the proposed integrated model. The level of occupants' satisfaction regarding the thermal environmental conditions defines the thermal comfort of occupants. Several mathematical models have been proposed exploring the correlation between thermal comfort variables to predict the thermal satisfaction of occupants. Among these models, the Graphic Comfort Zone method suggested by ASHRAE Standard 55\u20132010 [45] is used in this study to measure the discomfort hours. Based on this method, the total number of discomfort hours is calculated based on whether the humidity ratio and the operative temperature are within the regions provided in ASHRAE Standard 55\u20132010. These regions are derived from the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) and Predicted Percent Dissatisfied (PPD) indices developed by Fanger [46]. According to ASHRAE 55, the PMV index between +0.5 and −0.5 can be used as an indication of the thermally comfortable environment [39,45,47]. Hence, the optimal control strategies override the normal heating and cooling set-point temperatures at zone level to maintain the PMV within the comfort range. Therefore, unlike global set-point adjustment, occupants\u2019 thermal requirements can be met at zone level resulting in fewer discomfort hours. The energy ( E ) objective function is defined as a combination of the energy consumption of the HVAC system ( E H ), which is the summation of cooling ( C E t , z s ) and heating ( H E t , z s ) power consumption, and lighting ( E L ) system as shown below: (2) E ( X ) = M i n ( E H ( X ) + E L ( X ) ) (3) E H ( X ) = ∑ s = 1 S ∑ z = 1 Z ∑ t = 1 T O T ( C E t , z s + H E t , z s ) (4) E L ( X ) = ∑ s = 1 S ∑ z = 1 Z ∑ t = 1 T O T L P t , z s The HVAC system heating/cooling load is dependent on the internal heat gains ( I H G ) including gains from occupants ( I H G o c c ), lighting ( I H G l ), and equipment ( I H G e q ). The cooling energy at time-step t at zone z during season s ( C E t , z s ) is calculated using Equation (5) [48], where C O P is the coefficient of performance of the system. Focusing on occupancy, the summation of the latent ( Q L o c c ) and sensible heat gains ( Q S o c c ) comprises the total occupancy heat gain and are calculated as follows [49]: (5) C E t , z s = c o o l i n g l o a d s C O P (6) Q L o c c = C o u n t z × L H G o c c (7) Q S o c c = C o u n t z × S H G o c c × C L F Where C o u n t z is the number of occupants at each time-step t at zone z . L H G o c c and S H G o c c are the latent and sensible heat gain per person for the type of activity performed in the zone, respectively, and are derived from standards. Since part of the sensible heat generated by occupants is absorbed by the surroundings and then gradually released into the zone, a cooling load factor ( C L F ) is considered when calculating Q S o c c to reflect this time delay. This factor is also obtained from standards (e.g., ASHRAE) and is not needed for L H G o c c , which is instantaneously added to the zone [48]. The same concepts are used to calculate the heating energy. The lighting local control strategies are applied in near-real-time using 1-min occupancy data. Two different resolution levels of 30- and 60-min are used to control the HVAC system, as explained in Section 2.3.4. The optimization results are shown as a summation of zone energy consumption and the number of discomfort hours in a year using Equations (3) and (4). This is done to have an overall estimation of the effect of optimal local control strategies on building energy performance and comfort. The lighting power is calculated using Equation (8) [48]: (8) L P t , z s = L E z × I t , z s × A z 100 where: L P t , z s : Lighting power at time-step t at zone z during season s (W) L E z : Lighting energy at zone z (W/m2/100 lux) I t , z s : Zone illuminance level at time-step t at zone z during season s (lux) A z : Zone floor area (m2) The discomfort ( D C ) objective function is defined as the normalized summation of all discomfort time at all zones: (9) D C ( X ) = ∑ z = 1 Z ( A z ∑ s = 1 S ∑ t = 1 T O T D T t , z s ) ∑ z = i Z A z where D T t , z s is the discomfort time according to ASHRAE55 at time-step t in zone z during season s . 2.3.2 Simulation model Given outside weather conditions, building characteristics (e.g., building location, geometry, envelope, etc.), building systems' characteristics (e.g., the type of HVAC and lighting systems and their specifications), and internal loads (e.g., occupancy loads), a simulation model of a shared space is created to calculate the building energy consumption as well as the occupants\u2019 thermal condition mimicking the actual building energy performance. In this study, the simulation model is developed to investigate the effect of the application of multiple local control strategies on the energy performance of the building considering the dynamic occupancy information. 2.3.3 Integrated simulation-based optimization model Fig. 3 depicts the integration procedure of the simulation and the optimization models. The output of the simulation-based optimization model is a file containing the information pertinent to the local control strategies. This file provides the following information: (1) the type of the control action, such as turning on/off the lights; and (2) the optimal settings for each zone of the space. By capturing the locations of the occupants at the zone level, the HVAC and lighting systems in the corresponding zone are activated and adjusted using the optimal results obtained from the integrated framework of the simulation-based optimization considering a trade-off between occupants' satisfaction and the energy consumption. It is important to mention that defining detailed control strategies regarding the building's energy-consuming systems are out of the scope of this research. In this research, control strategies are limited to changing the space temperature and turning on/off the lighting system using the thermostat setting and light switches, respectively. 2.3.4 HVAC and lighting operation local controls \u2022 HVAC System Local Control The operation of the HVAC system to reach the desired temperature is not an instantaneous process like other energy-consuming systems (e.g., light). Therefore, having information regarding the next state of a space usage plays an important role in the operation of the HVAC system. To this end, the dynamic space usage patterns are required. Although the techniques proposed in this area of research are well-established, only a few studies considered the optimal operation of the HVAC system based on dynamic occupancy information in shared open-plan offices [18,50\u201354]. In office buildings, the HVAC system usually runs based on pre-determined set-point and set-back temperatures during the occupied and unoccupied hours, respectively. This corresponds to control the temperature for defined fixed schedules (e.g., 8 a.m. - 8 p.m.). Occupancy schedules, however, are highly dependent on occupants' work habits and they may deviate from one zone to another in the same shared office. Running the HVAC system based on a predefined schedule could result in higher energy consumption as well as occupants' dissatisfaction. On the other hand, working later than the pre-determined time in the fixed schedule in spaces conditioned based on the set-back temperature will have a negative impact on the occupants\u2019 productivity [55]. Having prior information pertinent to occupancy changes at zone level could be used as input for the optimal schedule-based local control of the HVAC system. Fig. 4 depicts the pseudocode showing how the HVAC local control algorithm adjusts the cooling set-point temperature during the cooling season using dynamic occupancy information. The same control procedure is used to set the heating set-point temperature with different sets of temperatures. Furthermore, two different HVAC schedules are considered in this study called simple and detailed schedules to apply optimal local control strategies. In the simple schedule, the HVAC system starts 1 h before occupants' first arrival to each zone to bring the zone to the desired temperature. The zone temperature will remain at set-point temperature throughout the day and the HVAC control system will set the zone temperature to the set-back temperature 1 h after the last departure of the occupants at that zone. The detailed HVAC schedule, however, follows the zone occupancy schedule. In this case, like the simple schedule, the HVAC system starts 1 h before occupants\u2019 first arrival to each zone and remains on for the first hour. Considering the lag time of the HVAC system to adjust the zone temperature, a 1-h time-step is used to check the occupancy status and adjust the zone temperature accordingly. As such, if the zone is unoccupied for at least 1 h, the set-back temperature is used. Otherwise, the set-point temperature is applied even when the zone is unoccupied. This procedure is repeated for the following hours until the end time of occupancy at each zone. \u2022 Lighting System Local Control Lighting control is performed to maintain an optimum illuminance level in occupied zones based on the dynamic occupancy information. Using schedule-based lighting control and turning off the lights during unoccupied periods lead to a reduction in the internal heat gains and eventually to a decrease in total building energy consumption. According to the dynamic occupancy information imported to the simulation model, the zone status can be determined at each time-step. Knowing the zone status, the lighting control algorithm, as demonstrated in Fig. 5 , sets the lighting operation schedule based on the dynamic occupancy schedule and adjusts the lighting power according to the illuminance level of the occupied zone selected by the optimization algorithm. 2.3.5 Building Energy Management System (BEMS) In order to integrate the dynamic occupancy-centered operation schedules of building energy-consuming systems with the simulation model, the EnergyPlus Energy Management System (EMS) is used. The EMS module is a high-level, generalized, supervisory control for building systems that utilizes EnergyPlus Runtime Language (Erl), which is a simplified programming language, to define the EMS control and modeling programs [56]. The EMS employs a set of sensors to retrieve information regarding the building's internal and external conditions. The collected data defines Erl variables to be used in control programs. Different changes are then performed on building systems through EMS actuators. Co-ordination between EMS sensors and actuators is performed through EnergyPlus simulation [56]. Using EMS helps to emulate, inside EnergyPlus, the same control actions implemented through BEMS in real buildings [57,58]. Fig. 6 illustrates the optimal local control algorithm used in this study. Although most of the traditional BEMSs control systems using 15-min time-step intervals, with the growing advances in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and the application of advanced data analytics to near real-time data gathered by Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, finer resolution levels are used by new BEMSs to monitor and control building systems [39,59]. This shows the importance of considering high-resolution levels for the application of control strategies. On the other hand, different resolution levels (i.e., time-steps i and m in Fig. 6) are required for controlling different building systems based on the discussion in Section 2.3.4. As a result, different time-steps are defined to develop the dynamic occupancy profiles for the control of various building systems as explained in Section 2.2. As illustrated in Fig. 6, time-step i is used to derive the zone occupancy patterns and accordingly adjust different schedules within the simulation model. This includes schedules regarding the zone occupancy, equipment, and lighting systems. If the zone is occupied, equipment and lights are turned on and the lighting power is calculated. Since i is smaller than m , the control module with time-step i is run for m / i times. Then, the HVAC system is controlled using the derived dynamic occupancy profiles according to the procedure shown in Fig. 2. In this study, i is considered as 1 min. Two resolution levels of 30 and 60 min are used as m to control the HVAC system. To run the optimal local control algorithm, the EMS sensors collect data regarding the occupancy status of each zone of the space (i.e., occupied or not in use) and the number of present occupants in the case of the occupied zone is calculated at each time-step. Based on the retrieved data, necessary control actions defined in EMS programs are performed through the EMS actuators. For instance, to apply HVAC system local control, once the EMS sensors retrieved the zone occupancy information, the optimization algorithm determines the optimal set-point temperature of the zone according to the values of the PMV index. Then, EMS actuators change the zone temperature to reach the optimal setting. 3 Case study 3.1 Simulation model and input data In order to evaluate the energy performance of an open-plan office, a simulation model of a shared space is described in this section as a basis to develop the proposed integrated model. As discussed in Section 2.1, the modeled space should be divided into multiple zones based on the HVAC terminal units and then the model can assign relevant dynamic occupancy information to each zone to control them accordingly. This makes the proposed method generic and scalable. In this study, a small open-plan office is used as a case study. However, the proposed method could be applied to office spaces regardless of the office size and the number of occupants. Although the number of zones, and subsequently the complexity of the model, increase in case of having larger spaces, the proposed local control method would function in the same way as explained in this study and could save more energy in these spaces. The simulation model is created in EnergyPlus version 8.6 [48]. The model's layout is defined based on the plan of a real open-plan office. Providing the building characteristics, such as building location and geometry, and its energy-consuming systems specifications, internal loads (e.g., occupancy, office equipment, and lighting) along with the external input (i.e., weather data), the simulation model calculates the space energy consumption, discomfort hours, and other required parameters at specified time-steps. Table 1 summarizes the input data of the simulation model. The occupancy and HVAC schedules are shown in Fig. 7 for a one-week period. Since the operation of building systems are highly dependent to the presence of occupants, the real occupancy data of the simulated open-plan office are collected over the course of one year (from April 1st, 2017 to March 31st, 2018) using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)-based monitoring system with a very high temporal resolution level (i.e., each second). High-resolution occupancy data are required for some specific applications, such as security and emergency situations. However, the high granularity of 1 s is not required for building energy management. Therefore, the real occupancy data are generated with the time intervals of 1 min. After processing the raw collected data to have the occupants-specific dynamic profiles, the occupancy information at zone level with required resolution levels are imported to the simulation model using EnergyPlus EMS in order to emulate the occupants' dynamic space utilization patterns. Moreover, EnergyPlus EMS is integrated with an optimization algorithm (i.e., the Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-ΙΙ) [63]) to design different optimal local control strategies using jEPlus + EA [64,65], a third-party optimization tool developed for EnergyPlus. In order to apply the local control strategies of building systems based on dynamic occupancy information, the zoning is used to assign different dynamic occupancy-centered schedules for the operation of building systems at each zone. These zones are created using virtual partitions to separate open spaces without having physical boundaries that could affect the energy consumption of the space. During zone occupancy, set-point temperatures are adjusted according to Table 2 for cooling and heating set-points. These ranges are selected based on the average occupants\u2019 preferences in each zone. In case of turning the lights on, the illuminance level of the occupied zone is set to be between 300 and 500 lux recommended by Illuminating Engineering Society of North America (IESNA) for office buildings [66]. 3.2 Building performance metrics To evaluate the performance of the simulation model under the application of different optimal local control strategies, the annual building energy consumption along with the time outside ASHRAE 55 comfort regions are considered as building performance indicators. The building performance indicators without the application of control strategies are used as the baseline and are denoted by P 0 u n c . The building performance metrics are calculated as follows: (10) Δ P = P c − P 0 u n c P 0 u n c where P c is the building performance indicators after the application of optimal local control strategies. 3.3 Results All simulations are run using the 1-min resolution level for a whole year. However, according to the discussion in Section 2.3.4, the HVAC system control is performed at 30- and 60-min time-steps. Six different cases are investigated in this paper among which four cases incorporate local control strategies using the optimization algorithm, and the other two cases are simulation models without the application of local control strategies nor optimization. Table 3 shows the specifications of the six cases. In this table, standard schedules are standard office schedules with the maximum occupancy between 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. and an hour of reduced occupancy for lunch at noon. Equipment and lighting are set to be on during occupancy periods in the first case. Occupancy, equipment and lighting schedules in the remaining cases, however, follow the real occupancy patterns derived from the real collected data. The heating and cooling set-point temperatures are fixed at 22 °C and 24 °C; respectively, for the first two cases. Fig. 8 illustrates the sets of Pareto optimal solutions for the four optimization cases. In all these cases, optimization is run for 100 generations with a population size of 20. For the two resolution levels, cases with the simple HVAC schedule outperform the ones with the detailed schedule from the comfort point of view. This observation indicates that simpler schedules for operating the HVAC system result in fewer discomfort hours. That is mainly due to the lag time required for the HVAC system to adjust the indoor temperature. Frequent changes in the zone temperature result in more dissatisfied occupants, which subsequently leads to a decrease in their productivity. For instance, although solutions A and B have the same energy consumption, there is an almost 11% increase in the discomfort hours as shown in Fig. 8. On the other hand, cases with the detailed HVAC schedule generate more energy conservative solutions as the Pareto fronts of these cases are more towards the lower right side of the graph in Fig. 8. Furthermore, the cases with lower resolution level for the application of local control strategies (i.e., 60 min) generate slightly better optimal solutions than those obtained from the cases with more frequent application of local control (i.e., 30 min) due to the same reason. As a result, the simple HVAC schedule with the 60-min resolution level (Case 4) found to be the best option for the application of local control strategies. The Pareto solutions Case 4 along with all other solutions generated by the optimization algorithm are shown in Fig. 9 . Almost 8% of the results of the optimization are optimal solutions that make the Pareto front as demonstrated in this figure. According to Fig. 9, three distinct areas are distinguished as shown by square, ellipse, and circle areas. The optimal solutions within the square area represent solutions with lower discomfort hours and higher energy consumption. The optimal solutions enclosed within the circle area, however, show the opposite trend (i.e., higher discomfort hours and lower energy consumption). Choosing any of these solutions means preferring one objective function for achieving better results at the expense of the other objective function. Therefore, the most desirable solutions that correspond to a trade-off between the two objective functions are the solutions inside the ellipse area. For Case 4, the most desirable solutions account for almost 51% of solutions (76 out of 150 optimal solutions). The average discomfort hours and energy consumption associated with this area are about 645 h and 6138 kWh, respectively. The comparison of the average discomfort hours and energy consumption of the most desirable optimal solutions in the four optimal cases are shown in Table 4 . The information regarding these solutions is also included in this table. Case 6 generates the best solutions in terms of building energy consumption. However, the highest number of discomfort hours is reported in this case. A balance between the two objective functions is observed in Case 4. This conclusion is aligned with the observations related to the whole Pareto optimal solutions (Fig. 8). After selecting Case 4 as the best case for the application of local control strategies, the results of comparing this case with the first two cases are shown in Table 5 . The comparison demonstrates that although using standard schedules leads to fewer discomfort hours, there is 15% more energy consumption compared to optimal solutions of Case 4. On the other hand, following real occupancy schedules without changing the set-points results in a considerable increase in the number of total discomfort hours (more than 148%) compared to standard schedules. Using optimization helps to find a balance between these two extreme cases. Although the improvement in the office energy consumption (i.e., 2%) is not as much as that of the discomfort hours, these hours could be cut by more than 50% when comparing Cases 2 and 4. The comparison between the PMV index of the three Cases 1, 2, and 4 in Zones 1 and 2 is demonstrated in Fig. 10 for a winter day in January. Moreover, Fig. 11 illustrates the changes in the PMV index during a summer day in June. The outcomes of one optimal solution, as a representative of the solutions enclosed within the ellipse area in Case 4 (as shown in Fig. 9), are used for the comparison purpose. As shown in Fig. 10, Case 1 demonstrates better performance compared to the other two cases from the comfort point of view during winter. However, comparing Cases 2 and 4 shows that the PMV index remains greater than −0.5 for the optimal case compared to that of Case 2 during most of the occupied hours except the start time of occupancy. Although the HVAC system is set to bring the zone temperature to the set-point 1 h before the start time of occupancy, this may not be always possible. This problem can be solved by considering earlier wake-up time for the HVAC system to provide enough time to adjust the zone temperature. As opposed to the heating season, analyzing the obtained results from Case 1 demonstrates that the most discomfort hours are happening during the cooling season. Therefore, the optimal case outperforms the other two non-optimal cases during most of the summer days. In Case 4, shifting the cooling temperature set-point by 3 °C (i.e., from 24 to 27 °C ) results in increasing the PMV index and improving the comfort condition. In addition, the PMV index in Case 4 becomes positive in many hours during the summer day showing the higher potential for saving energy while maintaining occupants\u2019 comfort during the cooling season compared to the wintertime. 4 Summary, conclusions and future work Occupancy-related information is recognized as influential factors affecting the energy operation in buildings. In order to enhance the energy management of buildings, occupancy-centered control strategies are required. Therefore, the need for localized and customizable comfort controls is increasing in open-plan office buildings to improve the occupants' satisfaction, and consequently their productivity. The main contribution of this paper is optimizing energy consumption and occupants\u2019 comfort in open-plan offices using local control based on occupancy dynamic data. In this paper, full-year dynamic occupancy profiles with high resolution of 1-min are developed using real occupancy data capturing the stochastic behavior of occupants. Having the dynamic occupancy profiles along with the indoor environmental conditions, this study contributes to the exploration of optimal local control strategies based on the integration of a simulation model with a multi-objective optimization process. It is concluded that the simple HVAC schedule with the 60-min resolution level is the best option for the application of local control strategies from the comfort point of view for the case study of this paper. The application of HVAC and lighting local control strategies results in improving the thermal condition by 50% along with 2% savings in energy consumption. More energy conservative solutions are, however, generated upon the usage of detailed HVAC schedules for both resolution levels. Using the proposed method in open-plan offices results in: (1) developing high-resolution dynamic occupancy profiles to represent temporal variations of occupancy patterns in open-plan offices; (2) developing local control algorithms for building energy-consuming systems; (3) finding the best settings to operate HVAC system including the type of HVAC schedule and the resolution level used to control this system; and (4) finding the trade-off between buildings' energy consumption and occupants\u2019 comfort levels by maintaining the PMV index within the comfortable range. The practical application of the proposed method aims at assisting decision-makers in evaluating optimized occupancy-centered building operations. There is a privacy issue when the occupants' identities are used to have detailed occupancy information. However, this issue can be resolved by anonymizing the occupants' data through defining occupancy profiles per zone. In addition, having this type of data could be vital for other purposes, such as emergency and safety. Moreover, using machine learning techniques could help to avoid privacy concerns by making the proposed model gradually adapt to the occupant's preferences. For this purpose, having access to the zone thermostat is essential to enable occupants to change the zone temperature whenever they feel uncomfortable with their surrounding environment. In such cases, whenever a new action regarding the zone temperature takes place, an update should be sent to the machine learning model to learn from the new setting. Using newly collected data helps the model to capture changes in occupants' preferences and gradually learn from them. Since the air flows from the terminal units have different temperatures, the effect of air mixing should be considered. It is assumed that the air mixing of zones only happens in the boundaries. This assumption makes the proposed method more applicable in large open-plan offices, where air mixing effects do not considerably affect the zone temperatures. Thus, the effect of air mixing should be considered as future work. To do so, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis of the proposed optimal local control strategies should be conducted to capture the air mixing between zones and the resultant variations in the zone temperature. In addition, the effect of using occupancy information generated by an occupancy prediction model should be investigated. To this aim, occupancy information generated by a probabilistic occupancy model can be fed to the integrated simulation-based optimization model for investigating the energy savings corresponding to predicted occupancy profiles. Analyzing the outcomes of this integration helps to evaluate the effect of occupancy prediction accuracy on the performance of the integrated model. Future work will also consider discomfort time from the lighting point of view including the effects of glare and positions of occupants with respect to windows.

        "dc:description": "Optimal management of buildings' energy-consuming systems is of great importance for minimizing building energy consumption while satisfying the occupants. Since the operation of building systems are highly dependent on the presence of occupants, considering the dynamic occupancy information has become crucial to reflect the occupancy dynamism within offices and the random patterns in occupant behavior. Thus, occupancy-centered control strategies are required in order to enhance the energy management of buildings. On the other hand, the need for localized and customizable comfort controls is increasing in office buildings to improve the occupants\u2019 satisfaction, and consequently their productivity. To this end, a framework aiming at developing optimal occupancy-centered local control strategies is proposed in this paper. A new simulation-based multi-objective optimization model of the energy consumption in offices is developed to exploit occupancy-related data and evaluate possible local control strategies to select the best ones. A set of real occupancy data collected over a period of one year is fed to the integrated simulation-based optimization model for investigating the energy-saving potentials. Comparing the results shows that a considerable improvement in the indoor comfort condition can be achieved through the application of the proposed framework. We conclude that optimal control strategies not only provide demand-driven control solutions but also optimize building energy performance. The integrated model enables dynamic building energy management according to dynamic occupancy patterns. It avoids over-conditioning that is the result of the application of common practices, which control building systems based on the peak occupancy.",
