Optimizing Building energy consumption is a key solution to reducing their environmental impact. In this context, Information Technology can be harnessed by deploying sensors inside buildings, to collect relevant data about both energy consumed and occupant behavior, since occupants influence building appliances, such as HVAC, lights, and hot water tanks. Predicting room occupancy can be a solution to heat/cool rooms for instance. But, as prediction models are not often accurate, we may face situations where HVAC is activated while the rooms are empty or vice-versa, leading to either a waste of energy or a lack of occupants\u2019 comfort. To predict user behavior, detect prediction errors, and correct the model, we introduce a graph mining-based optimization method that combines an occupant behavior prediction model and a selective reinforcement learning method, where error detection relies on sensors that detect real-time occupancy of rooms. We experimented with our approach on simulated data and results showed that, compared to conventional HVAC management, our model can reduce up to 57.8% of HVAC energy consumption, and provide up to 94.3% of occupants\u2019 comfort when using the prediction method only, and up to 80.1% of HVAC energy consumption, and provide up to 97% of occupants\u2019 comfort when using the reinforcement method to correct prediction errors.

Under the new policy scenario, global energy consumption and CO 2 emissions are expected to increase by approximately 50% and 21% respectively from 2018 to 2050 [1]. In this context, buildings consume a huge amount of energy reaching about 40% of the EU and US residential and commercial buildings [2]. Optimizing buildings\u2019 energy consumption becomes a big challenge and an important topic to study not only by academics but by industries and public authorities, as well. Building energy consumption depends on both external factors, such as buildings\u2019 envelope and orientation [3,4], and internal factors or indoor environment conditions, such as occupancy and occupants\u2019 behavior [5\u20137]. Recent research results showed significant differences between simulated energy consumption and real energy consumption, leading in most traditional building systems, which usually apply a fixed operating schedule according to certain regulations (such as ASHRAE or user surveys), to wasted energy and discomfort for the occupants [8]. Despite the above-mentioned findings as well as a lot of research in the field of building systems, there is a lack of research work on occupant behavior detection and analysis [5]. Building occupants highly impact the HVAC energy consumption, which represents over 50% of a typical building\u2019s energy consumption [9]. Therefore, understanding building occupancy and occupant behavior can help optimize HVAC energy consumption [10\u201313]. To ensure the thermal comfort of building occupants, which is based on building room temperatures, and since HVAC systems need time to preheat/pre-cool rooms, there are two configurations that can be considered: (i) the first one is to always turn on the HVAC system in all rooms during occupants\u2019 presence within the building, and (ii) the second one is to predict occupants\u2019 movements within building\u2019s rooms, and heat/cool only the visited rooms based on these predictions. Since the first configuration involves keeping the HVAC system on in all rooms, even in the empty ones, it will certainly cause energy waste. Therefore, the second configuration can be a solid alternative. However, any wrong prediction due to a transient change in the occupant\u2019s habits, may cause occupants to be in discomfort in some rooms. Hence, prediction error detection and correction are also needed to improve the prediction model for better satisfaction of occupant comfort. To provide such functions to our prediction model, we have considered an approach based on Reinforcement Learning (RL), since it is a promising Artificial Intelligence tool that revolutionizes building controls, as stated in [14], and in many research areas such as augmented data [15], social robotics [16], game theory [17\u201319], multi-agent systems [20\u201322], buildings [14,23,24], to name a few. Reinforcement Learning lies on reward maximization-based behavior decision-making, which means that each correct action performed by an RL agent obtains a reward (by maximizing a value function V ( x ) ). This helps the RL algorithm learn the optimal or correct behavior. This approach is widely used to train robots by learning new behaviors through trial and error interactions [25\u201327]. In our context, Reinforcement Learning fits well into the building rooms occupancy prediction model, by considering the inverse of each prediction error (i.e. activating/deactivating the HVAC in an unoccupied/occupied room) as the good behavior to reinforce in the next trained prediction model. In this paper, we developed a combined approach to optimize building energy usage while ensuring occupant comfort. First, we exploit our graph mining-based prediction model, introduced in [28,29], to predict room occupancy based on building occupants\u2019 movements over time. This occupancy prediction is then used to schedule the functioning of the HVAC inside rooms according to a prediction of their future occupancy status. Second, we track the room occupancy status based on real-time data collected by sensors deployed inside the building. The objective of this second step is to be able to use real-time sensor-based occupancy detection, as proposed in [30], to correct the prediction errors by deploying the reward reinforcement strategy, and then reactivating HVAC systems in occupied rooms, for which occupancy statuses have been miss-predicted by the prediction model. The main objective is to ensure building occupants\u2019 thermal comfort. Then, we make use of a selective reinforcement method to penalize the rooms that are occupied during a short period of time, by deactivating their HVAC. We experimented with our approach based on real-world building occupancy datasets and results showed that our combined approach allows saving up to 80.1% of HVAC energy consumption while ensuring up to 97% of thermal comfort for building occupants. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses related work. Section 3 introduces our methodology. Evaluation settings and results are detailed in Section 4. Section 5 concludes the paper and draws some lines for future work. 2 Related work A lot of research and work efforts have been carried out in the field of sensor-based energy optimization in buildings. They have focused on building occupants\u2019 behavior, room or space occupancy status, and occupancy prediction. Several data-driven methods have been introduced encompassing optimization approaches, probabilistic approaches, and machine learning approaches, to name a few. Kusiak et al. [31] have considered data-driven optimization methods to reduce HVAC energy consumption in offices by adjusting control settings (supply air static pressure and supply air temperature). They tested eight supervised machine learning algorithms to simulate the nonlinear relationship among controlled settings, energy consumption, and uncontrolled variables. They stated that, among the tested algorithms, multiple-linear perceptron (MLP) provides the highest accuracy. Their system saves up to 7% of the HVAC energy consumption. Brooks et al. [32] have proposed an improved Variable Air Volume (VAV) HVAC system based on occupancy. Their results demonstrate from 29% to 80% of energy reduction in a 5-room building served by the improved VAV HVAC system. Nevertheless, the HVAC equipment was common to all these rooms, which prevents them from controlling the HVAC for each room individually. Chen et al. [33] have proposed a stochastic occupancy modeling based on a Markov chain. Two new non-uniform Markov chain models have been proposed, which have been harnessed in two situations: multi-person single-zone (MOSZ) and multi-person multi-zone (MOMZ). The novelty of this study is that the state of the Markov chain has been defined as the increment in the number of occupants, not the number of MOSZ occupants. For MOMZ, the state of the Markov chain is a vector where each component is the occupancy increment in each region. This is performed with the aim to reduce the computing burden. To compute the probability matrix, a maximum likelihood estimation is used. The approach was compared to the ABM model proposed in [34] and the results showed that it performs better, under the assumption that \u201cthe maximum number of occupants moving into or out of a zone within a short interval is one\u201d. It is not the case in our work where we have considered all the movements of all the occupants inside a given zone. A real-time occupancy prediction method based on spatiotemporal analysis is proposed by Adamopoulou et al. [35]. In this study, the data is collected in real-time using depth image cameras as well as acoustic and motion sensors. Their goal is to calculate the occupancy rate prediction based on the collected data. Yilmaz et al. [36] have developed a bottom-up random occupant behavior modeling method to predict the use of household appliances in home buildings. The study is limited to home buildings to determine the data that affect energy consumption. The above-mentioned studies did not consider building room occupants\u2019 movement behavior relationship, which is an important factor that may cause changes in the occupancy status of the building rooms. In fact, room occupancy status is related to occupants\u2019 movements among rooms. Indeed, knowing the occupant movement patterns, we can predict the rooms that the user occupant would visit, and the ones that they would not visit, and then anticipate the activation (resp. deactivation) of the HVAC in the rooms accordingly, in order to improve their comfort and to minimize energy consumption. Besides, it is worth mentioning that there are some research works based on data-driven approaches, which use real-time data inputs to control an HVAC system using RL. In [37], Q-learning techniques using the tabular Q value function have been proposed, which is still not suitable for a large state space. Azuatalam et al. [38] developed a proximal policy optimization RL approach for optimal HVAC control for a commercial building. The proposed system optimizes up to 22% of energy usage. Dalamagkidis et al. [39] proposed an RL control method that takes into account the occupants\u2019 preferences, instead of the occupancy status of rooms. However, it decreases occupants\u2019 comfort. More recently, many papers have been published in the field of building energy management using AI techniques to show the opportunities of such approaches in this domain. We can name [40\u201345]. In [40], the authors studied the building energy consumption prediction for residential buildings using deep learning and other Machine Learning techniques. The main purpose is to forecast the potential building energy consumption at the early design phase to reduce the construction of more energy-inefficient buildings. Energy forecasting is more about the building structure and material than about the user\u2019s behavior. [41] introduced an overview of machine learning applications for smart buildings. The authors concluded that the greatest potential for energy efficiency improvement can be achieved by integrating adaptability solutions at the timescales of HVAC control and electricity market participation. [44] introduced a review of deep learning and Machine Learning for building energy. The authors focused on energy consumption/demand forecasting, for which they concluded that DL-based, hybrid, and ensemble-based models provided the highest robustness score. ANN, SVM, and single ML models provided good and medium robustness and LR-based models provided the lowest robustness score. [42] introduced an implementation of a home energy management system based on Reinforcement Learning. The authors endorsed the results of Barrett et al. [46] analysis, which demonstrated that Machine Learning-based adaptive approaches, such as Reinforcement Learning, can be efficient and can save still more resources in the HVAC field. The paper introduced an approach combining a minimization of electricity cost in smart homes and a Reinforcement Learning process, which jointly optimize the household electric appliances\u2019 power demand, HVAC system energy requirement, and energy storage system. This work is the closest one to our approach, but we consider in our case the users\u2019 behavior as one of the main parameters of our optimization process. Related to Reinforcement Learning (LR) for energy management, [43] introduced an overview of Reinforcement Learning-based energy management systems for electrified powertrains. Even though the paper focused on electrified powertrains, the overview of RL techniques is quite exhaustive and showed the usefulness of such approaches in optimization domains. In [45], the authors introduced an overview of building energy management with Reinforcement Learning and Model Predictive Control (MPC). The authors concluded that Traditional MPC and RL approaches can be complementary to each other to achieve improved reliability, data efficiency, and energy performance for a building energy management system (BEMS). Moreover, using Reinforcement Learning (RL) can enhance control performance in BEMS. RL has powerful decision-making capabilities as a branch of ML. Regarding the combination of a Graph mining approach with Reinforcement Learning, we noticed, after bibliographical research, that this combination has been considered in diverse fields, to mainly solve complex optimization problems, such as network alignment problem [47], dynamic electric vehicle charging optimization (which is a sort of allocation problem) [48], Covid-19 propagation in social IoT [49], and road networks for traffic volume forecasting in a freeway network [50], to name a few. But, to the best of our knowledge, there is no work similar to our combination of graph mining approach and Reinforcement Learning approaches within the same system. To summarize, the studied related works addressed either room occupancy or data-driven energy efficiency, but not both at the same time. From a prediction error detection and correction viewpoint, to the best of our knowledge, there is no work in the literature where this issue has been tackled in the field of building energy consumption. Therefore, in order to achieve the objectives of our smart building energy optimization, we describe in the subsequent sections our graph mining-based approach combined with an optimized method to deploy sensors inside a building to collect real-time data for room occupancy status determination and erroneous occupancy prediction detection and correction. 3 Methodology Our approach consists of the three following main algorithms: (i) Occupant Movement Prediction (OMP), based on the Graph Learning approach, to predict occupant movements, and HVAC system control plans (detailed in Section 3.2), and (ii) Real-time Room Occupancy based on Prediction Reinforcement (OPR) to detect and correct prediction using Reinforcement method (detailed in Section 3.3), and (iii) Selective Prediction Reinforcement (SPR) to select, which set of reinforcement actions to consider in the prediction improvement process (detailed in Section 3.4). Before detailing each step, we summarize the overall approach in the following Section 3.1 to better explain our approach and the role of each of its components. 3.1 Our approach in a nutshell Our approach consists of 7 main steps as illustrated in Fig. 1. Each step implements one or several components covering the aforementioned algorithms, going from the data collection to the prediction planning and correction. 1. At the beginning of the process, we deploy the sensors to collect the movement information, and we position the optimal number of sensors (inside the covered zone in the building to collect real data to be used to estimate the occupancy for the error detection and prediction correction processes), 2. We collect during the training week 1 the movement data of the occupants, 3. We train the graph model to identify the optimal time intervals and the movement patterns of the occupants for week i , i ≥ 1 , 4. We use the data of the current week i , i ≥ 1 to predict the room occupancy and the corresponding HVAC schedule for the next week i + 1 and apply the schedule for that week i + 1 , 5. At week i + 1 , we collect and process the real data provided by the sensors, 6. We detect the errors in the occupancy prediction model in that week i + 1 , 7. We correct the prediction model with the selective reinforcement method for the next iteration: next week i + 2 (go to step 3 and so on). 3.2 Occupant Movement Prediction (OMP) Occupant Movement Prediction (OMP) aims to compute future occurrences of occupants\u2019 movements within building rooms, and predict the occupancy status of the rooms, based on occupants\u2019 historical movements. Furthermore, the OMP process provides us with the optimal number of time intervals and their duration where the rooms are mainly occupied. Anticipating movements and occupancy allows a pre-commanding of the HVAC system to preheat/pre-cool rooms before occupant arrival. To do so, we modeled the building and the movements inside the building as a graph, on which we applied a Graph Learning algorithm to train a graph-based model. We summarize our graph-based approach in the following Sub-subsections, and we refer the reader to our previously published paper [28], for its thoroughly detailed description. To build our movements graph, let B be a building of N rooms, which are connected by hallways and corridors. Occupants can move from one room to another. We represent their movements inside the building by a graph G ( V , E ) , such that V represents the building rooms, and E represents possible movements among these rooms. We represents the movements graph of occupants O of building B as an adjacent matrix that can compacts the movements M V within a T I i = [ t 1 , t 2 ] time interval, such that: (1) M V = V [ t 1 , t 2 ] × V [ t 1 , t 2 ] ≡ ( m i , j ) = 1 if ( V i , V j ) ∈ E [ t 1 , t 2 ] 0 otherwise. Based on these movements, we extract movement patterns as fragments of the original graph G , by using a graph mining algorithm. However, for a better pattern extraction, we need to prepare the data such that only prominent and main movements are considered. Data preparation consists in unifying the time intervals (TOFU process described below) such as overlapping intervals and closely adjacent intervals, and then filtering the obtained time intervals to keep only the most relevant (frequent) ones for our prediction model (FMI process described below). Without these two steps, we can end up with a high fragmentation of the initial graph G leading to a prediction model with poor accuracy. As detailed in our previous work [28], a graph-mining algorithm is a suitable tool for predicting movement patterns. The whole process consists of the following steps: 1. Time interval Occupants Movement timestamp Unification (TOMU) 2. Frequent Movement time interval Identification (FMI) 3. Building occupants\u2019 movements prediction model 4. Decision making 3.2.1 Time interval Occupants Movement timestamp Unification (TOMU) A graph mining algorithm is suitable for selecting frequent subsequences (i.e. subgraphs of movements). It can also distinguish the same movement that occurred within very close timestamps. As we are dealing with human movements, distinguishing such movements is not that relevant. Therefore, we unified them to accelerate the algorithm and provide human-readable results. To perform this timestamp unification, we have made use of a hierarchical clustering algorithm that groups movements having close timestamps. We assigned, then, fixed timestamps (the smallest timestamps in the group) to each movement in the same group. Fig. 2 illustrates the TOMU process through an example of timestamp unification of movement timestamps, which are close to each other. 3.2.2 Frequent Movement sequence time interval Identification (FMI) To optimize prediction periods, we need to divide a day (24 h) into a Time Interval List TIL = { TI 1 , \u2026 , TI t } of t time intervals, where TI i , i ∈ { 1 . . t } = [ t S i , t E i ] , with t S i is the beginning of the interval, and t E i is the end of the interval. We apply on each day d a hierarchical clustering method to generate its set of time intervals, denoted by TIL d , then we eliminate all TIL d that contain at least a TI i such that t E i − t S i < m i n T i m e , with m i n T i m e is the required duration to heat/cool a room to the comfort temperature. A second elimination process is required to select, from obtained TIL lists, the representative one, i.e. the one which is the most frequent. It then belongs to the TIL decomposition for all days. 3.2.3 Predicting building occupants\u2019 movements To proceed with the occupants\u2019 movements prediction, we divide occupants\u2019 movements of each day into groups based on the timestamp of each movement. We denote by M v = { M v D 1 , \u2026 , M v D d } the list of movements of all considered days, where M v D i is the set of all the movements of day D i , such that each movement is represented by the triplet [ R s , R D , t R s , R D ] , where R s is the source room, R D is the destination room, and t R s , R D is the timestamp corresponding to the time when the movement occurred. Therefore, M v D i of m movements is defined as: (2) M v D i = { E 1 = [ R s 1 , R D 1 , t ( E 1 ) ] , \u2026 , E m = [ R s m , R D m , t ( E m ) ] } , where E i is the edge (movement) ( R s i , R D i ) annotated with its timestamp t ( E i ) . Algorithm 1 describes the sub-movement list extraction for each TI of TIL . The outcome of Algorithm 1 is then used as the input of the graph mining algorithm to extract occupants\u2019 movements patterns for each TI of TIL . 3.2.4 Decision-making process After extracting the list of movements of each day and for each TI of TIL , we compute the movement prediction matrix as follows: (3) M P = V [ t 1 , t 2 ] × V [ t 1 , t 2 ] ≡ ( m i , j ) = 1 if ( V i , V j ) ∈ E [ t 1 , t 2 ] 0 otherwise. We extract, from M P , the occupancy prediction vector, denoted by P O [ t 1 , t 2 ] for Predicted Occupancy during the time interval [ t 1 , t 2 ] , of V elements (rooms), such that each room defined as a destination is considered as an occupied room. More precisely, P O [ t 1 , t 2 ] = [ P 1 s , \u2026 , P v s ] , such that P x s is the predicted occupancy status of room x , computed using formula (4), with s is the source room, and v is the number of rooms in the building. (4) P s x = 1 if ∃ ( V i , V x ) ∈ E [ t 1 , t 2 ] , i ∈ [ 1 , v ] 0 otherwise. We introduce our Occupants\u2019 Movement Prediction process (OMP) in Algorithm 2, in order to compute the occupancy prediction for all rooms during all the considered prediction periods. Based on Algorithm 2, the rooms, which are predicted as occupied during TI i = [ t a , t b ] , will be preheated/pre-cooled t minutes before t a . As this process depends upon human movements, which may be transient, we added in our next step the real-time occupancy verification and prediction correction. Besides, most trained ML models suffer from a high error prediction rate when they are put in production with real-world data. In Fig. 3, we illustrate an example of the timeline functioning of the HVAC predicted for a weekday for the office rooms of the lab building, compared to the basic functioning of the heating system (the duration of the intervals are extracted from the dataset we have used for our experiments in Section 4, by using the OMP process). We notice the time interval detected where the office rooms are occupied (therefore the value of the HVAC is on, represented by the value 1 ), and the time intervals where the offices are empty, and the HVAC is put on standby mode (represented by the value 0.5), and the night period where the HVAC is off (represented by the value 0 ). 3.3 Room Occupancy detection-based Prediction Reinforcement (OPR) The goal of this step is to increase building occupants\u2019 comfort by detecting model prediction errors. In fact, relying on the occupants\u2019 movement predictions, the system decides the HVAC status for each room of the building during each time interval TI = [ t S , t E ] of TIL . As such predictions may contain errors, we aim at detecting and correcting them with a new algorithm called OPR for real-time room Occupancy detection-based Prediction Reinforcement. 3.3.1 Room occupancy error detection The real-time room occupancy status at a timestamp t , denoted by R O t , is computed based on data collected from the sensors deployed inside the building as detailed in [30]. In [30], the real sensors have been deployed inside the Research Institution called E.ON ERC in Aachen Germany, in 10 multi-person offices. The considered sensors collected indoor temperatures, humidity, CO2 level, VOC, windows and door state, and outdoor temperatures and humidity. The process determined the required number of sensors to use and the periodicity of the data collection. The collected data has been then cleaned and checked manually to ensure a certain level of accuracy. Let R O t = [ R 1 , \u2026 , R v ] , such that R x is the occupancy status of room x at time t . We compare P O TI , the predicted occupancy vector for time interval TI, to R O t such that t ∈ TI to detect occupancy prediction errors. The comparison result is denoted by O C for Occupancy Comparison and is computed by formula (5). As P O TI and R O t are 2 vectors of binary values, then OC is the vector containing the absolute values of the position-wise subtractions of the two vectors. The result is also a vector of binary values. (5) O C = [ O C 1 , \u2026 , O C v ] = | P O TI − R O t | = [ | P O TI ( R 1 ) − R O t ( R 1 ) | , \u2026 , | P O TI ( R n ) − R O t ( R n ) | ] The obtained vector O C is used for correcting the prediction model using the reinforcement method, as detailed below. 3.3.2 Prediction model reinforcement For each room x that was detected as occupied during TI , each time it appears, we need to reinforce its weight (denoted W x , TI ), which gives it high importance when training the next prediction model. Initially, all building rooms have a weight of 0 . Each time, during TI , a room x is detected as occupied, its weight increases by 1 . The weight of room x during a time interval TI is calculated as follows: \u2022 If R x = 1 then room x was occupied during timestamp t in TI , then W x , TI is increased by 1 , \u2022 Otherwise, the room weight does not need to be reinforced, \u2022 if O C x = 1 (which means that the prediction status for room x is erroneous), then we generate a new occupant\u2019s movement to room x . In the movement graph, the increase in the weight of room x is used to duplicate the existing movements from the other rooms to room x . This increases the chance of x being selected by the graph mining algorithm. Consequently, if during the last prediction, room x was predicted as non-occupied, by using the reinforcement method, we give it more chance to be heated/cooled in the future. By doing this reinforcement process, a new graph, containing the past movements plus the duplicated movements, is created. It will be used for training the next graph-based prediction model. Example 1 Suppose that we detect occupancy of room x during time interval TI = [ 10 : 00 , 12 : 00 ] and the occupancy timestamps of this room are: { 10 : 15 , 11 : 00 , 11 : 40 } . Then, W x , TI ← W x , TI + 1 for each timestamp t ∈ { 10 : 30 , 11 : 00 , 11 : 30 } . If for t = 10 : 30 error O C i = 1 , then the system will generate new occupant\u2019s movement and occupancy prediction for the new time interval: [ 10 : 30 , 12 : 00 ] . The same tests and decision are made for t = 11 : 00 and t = 11 : 30 . In the end, we obtain a weight matrix W of n rows and v columns, where n is the number of sub-intervals TI , and v the number of rooms in the building. We run this process for each room x of the building and for each time interval TI . This is formalized in Algorithm 3. The values of N M V TI are used to generate the reinforcement occupancy prediction model of each room x of the v rooms of the building and for each time interval TI of the list of n time intervals. The prediction results are stored in an n × v matrix, denoted O P R M (for room Occupancy detection-based Prediction Reinforcement Matrix). In this subsection, in order to improve occupants\u2019 comfort, we have proposed a reinforcement approach to increase the chance of rooms being selected by the prediction model. Nevertheless, we did not take into account the occupancy duration of rooms, which can have a huge impact on energy consumption and occupant comfort. In fact, if room x has many ingoing and outgoing movements, its chance of being selected for heating/cooling would be increased by the prediction model, even if its total occupancy duration is short. This leads to a high increase in energy consumption and a low increase in occupants\u2019 comfort. In this case, we can consider the possibility of turning off the HVAC system in some rooms that were occupied for a short period of time in the past. The goal of doing so is to detect the rooms that have short occupancy periods and to enforce the prediction system to disadvantage them, as described in the next subsection. 3.4 Selective Prediction Reinforcement (SPR) process Prediction Model Reinforcement aims to increase the weight of a given room x if it is highly visited by the occupants. The goal is to increase the chance that room x will be selected by the algorithm and then activate the HVAC system in it. As said above, if room x is highly visited but during a short period of time, activating the HVAC system in it will be a waste of energy. This is why we propose to distinguish, within the selected rooms, the ones for which we will not activate the HVAC, even if they are selected by the selective reinforcement algorithm. Using this method, helps us focus on optimizing energy by deactivating the HVAC system within less occupied rooms. Our selective approach allows adding a new restriction condition that impacts rooms occupancy prediction; it is described as follows: \u2022 If occupancy duration of room x during time interval TI is less than a Minimum acceptable Loss of Comfort duration (denoted by MLC ), then the room occupancy prediction is set to be non-occupied, overlooking the prediction result, even if the model predicts that it will be occupied. It is an empirical parameter that can be set by the user at the initialization step of the system. The user can fix this value depending on occupants\u2019 preferences, building type, activities carried out in the building, the minimum temperatures recorded in the building zones, weather conditions, etc. \u2022 Otherwise, the room occupancy prediction generated by the model will be kept valid and unmodified. Example 2 shows how the approach works in a simple use case. Example 2 Suppose that we detect occupancy of room x during time interval TI = [ 10 : 00 , 12 : 00 ] and the occupancy timestamps of this room are: { 10 : 15 , 11 : 00 , 11 : 40 } . Then, W x , TI ← W x , TI + 3 (increasing of the weight by 1 for each timestamp). In this case, the weight of x will increase by 3 . If for all these movements, x has an occupancy duration of 10 min only, and if the OPR decides to turn the HVAC system on in this room during TI , then the occupant comfort will increase by 10 min, but the energy consumption will increase by 2 h ( TI duration). In this case, for MLC = 15 , the system decides to turn the HVAC system off in room x . 3.5 Reinforcement learning and data poisoning problem According to scientific literature such as [51,52] (to cite a few), data poisoning attacks aim at compromising the model integrity by contaminating training data to make the resulting model false or unusable. This attack is performed at the training phase and can target the availability of the model in case of refining (tuning) an existing model or the integrity of the data in the case where the model is trained from scratch, either locally or remotely. Our system is not subject to data poisoning attacks for the following main reason: All the components of our testing system are owned, handled, controlled, and hosted on the servers of our University Lab, such that: \u2022 The sensors (purchased and owned by the lab) send the collected data to a dedicated server owned by the University lab. The data are sent to a Lora antenna which forwards them to our server based on a mobile connection (4G). The server is endowed with encryption functionalities to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the data. Then the dataset is totally built by the lab teams. There is no risk of data poisoning at this level. \u2022 The training process is performed inside our lab within the lab servers. There is neither externalization nor reusing of an existing model, which mitigates the risk of data poisoning at the model level. Nevertheless, our system needs to handle data quality issues related to the accuracy of the collected and transmitted data, which could be affected by diverse events such as device (sensor and/or antenna) corruption or failure, server corruption or crashing, multiple sending of the same data, data missing, etc. Data needs to be monitored from its collection to its storage in the database and be subject to a cleaning process as in any Machine Learning process. These concerns are common to all ML-RL-based systems that we need to take into account to provide users with a fully functional, safe, and trustworthy environment. 4 Evaluation and results In this section, we detail the experiments carried out to evaluate our approach and we discuss the obtained results. Section 4.1 describes the dataset, which served for the simulation scenario (use-case) we have implemented. Section 4.2 describes the steps we followed to experiment with the processes we defined above. Section 4.3 lists the results we obtained and discusses them. As a validation of our approach, we compared our ML-based occupancy prediction method with the probabilistic stochastic method introduced in [33], in Section 4.4. 4.1 Dataset and use-case description We have considered a 4-week dataset of observed movements of four people within university building rooms. We started by training the model for the first week: Time interval Occupants Movement timestamp Unification (TOMU), Frequent Movement sequence time interval Identification (FMI), and occupants\u2019 movements prediction model training. Then, based on the occupants\u2019 movement data collected during the first week, we apply OPR to give higher weight to the rooms that were occupied during the first week. Thereafter, we use the SPR approach to make an equilibrium between the building\u2019s energy optimization and occupants\u2019 comfort. At the end of each week, we repeat the same steps as the previous weeks to improve the prediction model performance, as indicated in Fig. 1. Fig. 4 illustrates the rooms of the considered building. Doors are represented by solid-line triangles. Each room and space has its own HVAC system to control its temperature, as represented in its bottom left corner. We represent the building as a graph, such that building rooms are the set of vertices or nodes, and possible movements within these rooms correspond to the edges. Fig. 5 illustrates the graph drawn from our building (Fig. 4). The data used in the simulation gathered the observed movements within the building of four occupants { O 1 , O 2 , O 3 , O 4 } . For example, occupant O 1 mainly works in Office 1. He/she enters the building at around 8 : 30 am , works in office 1, takes his/her lunch at the Break Room at around 12 pm , has a meeting once or twice a week in the Meeting Room, and leaves the building at 6 : 00 pm . We start recording movements from the moment the occupants enter the building; in our case, Hallway 1 ( R 1 ) represents the entrance of the building. The last recorded movement is by the end of the day or when the occupants have left the building. Therefore, each movement graph depends on a different occupant\u2019s behavior. Hence, in our case, we can end up with four movements\u2019 graphs per day: a graph for each occupant. For the HVAC functioning, in this paper, we have considered the NF X35-203/ISO 7730 norm, which states that thermal comfort in office rooms is between 20 and 22 °C. As it is a fixed value, and to simplify the testing environment, we measured the thermal comfort based only on the time when the HVAC is on, and the room is occupied. It is also noteworthy to mention that the HVAC systems we have considered do not provide a chilling function. We considered the heating function only since temperatures do not exceed 25°in autumn, winter, and spring, and the premises are closed during summer. The current system has 3 states: ON (value 1 in Fig. 3), OFF (value 0 in Fig. 3), and Standby (value 0.5 in Fig. 3). When a temperature reaches the desired value, the HVAC is set to standby mode. It is also put on that mode from 7 pm to 6:59 am. We can improve our solution by installing thermostats in all office rooms so that the occupants can set their thermal comfort according to their preferences. The collected data can then be used to improve the accuracy of the energy consumed by the HVAC system. 4.2 Experiment description In the Occupant Movement Prediction (OMP) step, we used gSpan (graph-based substructure pattern mining) algorithm, for selecting frequent subgraphs from movement graphs. It requires an important parameter called the minimum frequency of acceptance of a subgraph (the minimum number of times a subgraph has to appear in the graph to be considered as a pattern), which means that the algorithm selects only subgraphs that occur with a minimum number of times greater than or equal to that frequency of acceptance. In this step, we only calculate the occupants\u2019 movement prediction. Then, based on the prediction model, a decision of turning the HVAC system on or off will be taken. In our experiment, we have considered a frequency of acceptance of 50%. Thus, all subgraphs that appear less than 50% for the OMP process are discarded. This frequency of appearance can seem to be low but it is adequate to our application context since each occupant has their own office room and we need to capture in our prediction model his/her individual movements too. As we have experimented, a higher frequency of acceptance (60% for instance) generates a weak model in terms of accuracy of the room occupancy status since it limits the prediction model to only the movements occurring among shared spaces in the building, such as hallways, corridors, and breakrooms. Furthermore, it is worth noticing that this value is empirical at this level of the experiment, and we need to tune it to obtain better prediction accuracy. In the room Occupancy detection-based Prediction Reinforcement (OPR) process, we use the reinforcement approach to increase the weight of each room during each time interval. The more visited a room is, the higher its chance to be selected by the prediction algorithm. This reinforcement helps the system converge to an optimal solution, which increases occupants\u2019 comfort within the building, as well. We finally added an occupancy duration condition to the rooms to be selected, as the third step called SPR, for Selective Prediction Reinforcement. For each of the 8 rooms of the building, their occupancy in the previous week is less than 5 times 15 min ( 5 is for 5 working days in a regular week), then the room will be considered as non-occupied and the HVAC system in that room will be turned off. We have chosen 15 min for an acceptable lack of comfort duration, as an empirical value. The increase of this value leads to both minimizing the building\u2019s energy consumption, and losing more comfort since the HVAC of the rooms will be turned off more often. But, the reduction of this value means more comfort for the occupant and a possible higher building energy consumption. We computed and compared, for each process, the saved energy percentage by the HVAC system compared to the conventional use of such systems where the HVAC is on during office hours (from 08 h 00 am to 06 pm ). We also computed the occupant\u2019s comfort percentage, based on Eq. (6). The occupant\u2019s comfort percentage is the ratio of the duration where the office is occupied and the HVAC is on over the total occupancy duration: (6) O C O i = Q i T i where: Q i is the cumulative durations in minutes where an occupant is inside an office and the HVAC of that office is on. T i is the total occupancy duration of the building, for each occupant. In our experiment, we supposed that the office hours are the same (from 8h00 am to 6h00 pm) for all the occupants, to simplify the experiments. This formula allows us to assess the comfort in a neutral way (not related to the user preference or feelings of heat/cold). The users can regulate or adjust the thermostat of their office as they feel the most comfortable. This approach eliminates the biases introduced by the personal feeling of the temperatures, as we know that different people feel differently in the same temperatures. 4.3 Results and discussion Fig. 6 displays the percentages of saved energy within all building rooms, for each week, except for the first week that was used to train the model, by using OMP. Saved energy is the difference between HVAC activation duration in a regular system (turned on during all working time), and the controlled HVAC by our proposed system, which is turned on only on predicted occupancy periods. Results show that, in our case and with 50% of prediction accuracy, we can save up to 57.8% of HVAC energy consumption during the second week. Then the saved energy starts decreasing to reach 15.5% for week 4 , with an average mean of 31.9%. This decrease in energy saving is due to the non-existence of prediction error correction. This result can vary depending on building type and occupants\u2019 behavior. Fig. 7 illustrates the provided occupants\u2019 comfort for the four occupants during each week, by using OMP. It shows that, in our case, OMP provides between 42.8% and 94.3% of occupant\u2019s comfort when using OMP only. In fact, 42.8% of weekly occupant\u2019s comfort is low, since more than half of the time, the comfort is not provided to the building occupants. The average of provided comfort for occupant O 1 is 73.3%. The comfort provided for occupant O 2 , occupant O 3 and occupant O 4 are, between 38.5% and 82.9%, between 29.7% and 87.5% and between 29.4% and 86.7%, respectively. The average comfort provided is between 62.2% and 73.3%. This lack of comfort, in the beginning, is caused by the lack of data for the prediction model. But, even after that, the model still causes a lack of comfort (for example 80% of comfort for occupant O 2 in week 4 ). Fig. 8 shows that when using OPR, saved energy decreases compared to OMP. It varies between 10.8% and 57.8%, with an average of 27.7%. This is explained by the reinforcement process that helps heat some rooms based on the OPR results. These rooms may be predicted as empty by the OMP process. Fig. 9 shows that when OPR is also deployed, comfort can reach 100%, 100%, 87.5% and 97.1% for occupants O 1 , O 2 , O 3 , O 4 , respectively by the week 4 . This high difference between OMP and OPR results is due to the reinforcement process that gives more chances to the rooms that were predicted as unoccupied by OMP, but were occupied in reality. The low occupant comfort of week 2 is due to the prediction errors that occurred that week since the predictions are made based on the data of only one week. The improvement in the next weeks is due to the corrections performed by the OPR process on the erroneous predictions, based on the data collected from the previous weeks. Furthermore, the low comfort detected in week 2 is consistent with the high percentage of energy saved for week 2 (Fig. 8), since the less the rooms are heated the more energy is saved. By using the OPR process, the average occupants\u2019 comfort increased by 5.7%, 6.7%, 2.8% and 12% for occupants O 1 , O 2 , O 3 , O 4 , respectively. Consequently, the OPR process helps improve building occupants\u2019 comfort. To better optimize the building\u2019s energy consumption, we experimented with the SPR process. Fig. 10 shows that using SPR process helps reduce energy consumption between 32.3% and 80.1%. That shows that, within the three compared approaches, SPR is the best one to optimize energy consumption. The comfort generated based on the SPR decision is illustrated in Fig. 11. It ensures between 13.8% and 97% of occupants\u2019 comfort, too. The reason why occupants\u2019 comfort is low for week two, is that the model is not well trained, but the results show that, after one week, the comfort highly increased. For instance, the comfort went from 13.8% to 94.4% during one week for occupant O 4 . Despite the promising results obtained here, the approach has its limitations that can be considered in future development as improvement lines. We summarize some of these limitations in what follows. \u2022 External parameters (such as building structure, envelop, and orientation), and external weather conditions (such as temperature and humidity) can be rich sources of useful data for the process of activating/deactivating the HVAC system, in order to improve the accuracy of the system and better optimize the energy consumption. \u2022 Personal comfort feeling has not been considered in the definition of thermal comfort. It would be more accurate to define a user-centric metric to quantify, measure, and optimize personal thermal comfort. \u2022 The most accurate way to measure energy consumption consists in measuring the real consumption, by installing an energy meter at the HVAC system. It was not the case in our study because of the existing limitation regarding public institution facility modification. \u2022 User behavior adaptation to the system decisions is not considered in our model. Indeed, users can modify their habits in response to the HVAC functioning. Capturing habit shifting is a hard problem by itself. \u2022 To be able to generalize the results, we need to consider different building models, and different offices to obtain bigger and better datasets. The process of deployment should be also developed to adapt the system to different kinds of buildings, offices, and working patterns of the occupants. 4.4 Comparison and validation of the proposed occupancy prediction method Hereinafter, we compare our occupancy prediction method with the stochastic method introduced in [33]. We limit our comparison to the process of occupancy prediction since it is the basis of our energy consumption-versus occupant comfort optimization approach. Our comparison study is based on the following assumptions: \u2022 The considered lab building is divided into 8 rooms (see Fig. 5), \u2022 We considered the movements of 4 people during 4 weeks, \u2022 First scenario: the lab is seen as one zone; therefore we compare our approach with the Multi-Occupant Single Zone (MOSZ) results [33], \u2022 Second scenario: the rooms are grouped functionally into 4 zones: Offices, Break Room, Meeting Room and Hallways, to compare our method with the Multi-Occupant Multiple Zones (MOMZ) results [33], \u2022 As our approach is based on an ML process, it is important to compute the evolution of the occupancy prediction quality over the time, \u2022 As in [33], the comparison criterion tested is the NRMSD for Normalized Root Mean Square Deviation that compares the difference between the mean occupancy predicted and the real ones (obtained from sensors). The following formula is used: (7) N R M S D ( x , y ) = \u2016 x − y \u2016 / K m a x ( z ) − m i n ( z ) , where x = [ x 1 , \u2026 , x K ] is a vector of K predicted values, y = [ y 1 , \u2026 , y K ] is a vector of K estimated values, z = [ x T , y T ] T , and \u2016 . \u2016 is the Euclidean norm. \u2022 For each week i , i ∈ { 2 , 3 , 4 } , the occupancy prediction is based on real data collected by sensors during the week i − 1 , that we compare with the real data collected during that week i . We compute, then, the NRMSD of the prediction compared to the real data for each week. 4.4.1 First scenario: the lab building floor is seen as one zone In this scenario, we consider our lab building as one zone where the 4 occupants can move around according to their usual activities. We recall that the MOSZ approach is tested on 16 weeks of collected data, as mentioned in [33] but our approach is tested on 4 weeks of data. In case 1, we computed the occupancy prediction in all rooms including the hallways, and in case 2, we discarded the hallways since no activity is carried out there and they do not affect the user\u2019s comfort. The results obtained are listed in Table 1. We notice that our approach performs quite similarly to the MOSZ approach after only 4 weeks of training and correcting the predictions in case 1 (including the hallways movements) and converges quickly to a better model in case 2 (discarding the movements in the hallways). We illustrate in Fig. 12, the evolution of the NRMSD from week 2 to week 4 for both cases. We notice that the quality of the prediction is improving over time since each week\u2019s prediction integrates the correction of the errors detected over the previous week. Given that the movements of the occupants are consistent with their activities over the weeks, we expect a better improvement in the prediction week after week. Moreover, we notice that the quality of prediction of week 2 , based on the values collected in week 1 , is mediocre. This is why the occupant\u2019s comfort is low during the week 2 . In week 3 , the same level of error is also obtained, but the selective reinforcement approach we developed, ignores the occupancy of a room when it is short (less than 15 min) and targets the periods of long occupation duration to increase the occupant\u2019s comfort. 4.4.2 Second scenario: the lab building floor is seen as multiple zones In the MOMZ scenario, we grouped the rooms of Fig. 5 into 4 main zones as follows: \u2022 Z 1 : Hallways including { R 1 , R 4 } , \u2022 Z 2 : Offices including { R 2 , R 3 , R 6 , R 7 } , \u2022 Z 3 : Break room { R 5 } , \u2022 Z 4 : Meeting room { R 8 } . Similarly to scenario 1, we discard Z 1 , since it does not affect the comfort of the occupants. We recall in Table 2, the NRMSD obtained in the case of the MOMZ approach in [33] based on 6 weeks of data processing, and we summarize in Table 3 the NRMSD we obtained for our approach after 4 weeks of prediction and correction. We can only compare the mean of the NRMSD of all the zones because we worked on a different dataset and a different use case (lab building in our case, versus commercial building in the case of [33]). We notice from column \u201cMean NRMSD\u201d of Tables 2 and 3 that both approaches have the same level of prediction error (0.0524 for the MOMZ approach and 0.0565 for our approach), with a slight advantage for the MOMZ approach. But, we need to mention that our approach is tested on a 4-week dataset and the MOMZ is tested on a 6-week dataset. From the continuous prediction improvement property of our approach (as shown in Fig. 12), we expect a better accuracy for our approach over time. It is worth noticing that the heating time in our case does not correspond to the occupancy time. Indeed, in our approach, when a room is occupied for a short period of time (less than the minimum occupancy) during a time interval, then the system considers that it is empty and no heating is activated until the next time interval, where another prediction is made. In this way, frequently visited rooms for short periods of time will not be heated leading to a considerable amount of saved energy. 5 Conclusion and perspective In this paper, we developed a combined approach for Occupants Movements Prediction (OMP), room Occupancy detection-based Prediction Reinforcement (OPR), and Selective Prediction Reinforcement (SPR). OMP is used first to predict occupants\u2019 movements among building rooms and heat/cool rooms according to their predicted occupancy. Then, to deal with prediction errors causing occupants\u2019 discomfort, the OPR is activated to correct identified erroneous predictions and to monitor the HVACs accordingly. Then, to minimize energy consumption while keeping comfort as high as possible, the Selective Prediction Reinforcement (SPR) approach is proposed to turn the HVAC systems off in rooms, which are occupied for a very short duration. Results showed that OMP can help reduce between 15.5% and 57.8% of the HVAC consumed energy and provide between 29.4% and 94.3% of occupants\u2019 comfort. The OPR helps reduce between 10.8% and 57.8% of the HVAC energy consumption and provides a thermal comfort between 29.4% and 100%. To decrease energy consumption, we made use of the SPR approach that allows reducing the energy consumption up to 80.1% and providing occupants\u2019 comfort up to 97% of the time. So far, the proposed approaches help save energy consumption and ensure occupants\u2019 comfort, but experiments with a large amount of data by collecting occupants\u2019 movements are needed to be able to better validate the approach we developed in this paper. Moreover, we need to consider different kinds of buildings to better tune and improve our prediction model and the overall system parameters, as well.

        "dc:description": "Optimizing Building energy consumption is a key solution to reducing their environmental impact. In this context, Information Technology can be harnessed by deploying sensors inside buildings, to collect relevant data about both energy consumed and occupant behavior, since occupants influence building appliances, such as HVAC, lights, and hot water tanks. Predicting room occupancy can be a solution to heat/cool rooms for instance. But, as prediction models are not often accurate, we may face situations where HVAC is activated while the rooms are empty or vice-versa, leading to either a waste of energy or a lack of occupants\u2019 comfort. To predict user behavior, detect prediction errors, and correct the model, we introduce a graph mining-based optimization method that combines an occupant behavior prediction model and a selective reinforcement learning method, where error detection relies on sensors that detect real-time occupancy of rooms. We experimented with our approach on simulated data and results showed that, compared to conventional HVAC management, our model can reduce up to 57.8% of HVAC energy consumption, and provide up to 94.3% of occupants\u2019 comfort when using the prediction method only, and up to 80.1% of HVAC energy consumption, and provide up to 97% of occupants\u2019 comfort when using the reinforcement method to correct prediction errors.",
