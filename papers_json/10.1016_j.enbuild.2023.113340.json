Department of Mechanical and Automation Engineering The Chinese University of Hong Kong Shatin N.T. 999077 Hong Kong SAR China To reduce indoor PM2.5 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 μm) pollution and maintain thermal comfort with relatively low energy consumption, this study employed deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to develop a controller that could simultaneously control the window, air cleaner, and air conditioner in a real room. First, a room model was constructed on the basis of 3-week monitoring data in the real room. The controller was then trained in a virtual room utilizing the deep Q-network (DQN) algorithm. To evaluate the effectiveness of the DQN controller in the real world, a smart indoor environmental control system was established. Field testing was conducted in the real room for 4 days. The performance of the DQN controller was compared with that of an occupant-based baseline controller. During the testing period, the trained DQN controller could smartly control the window, air cleaner, and air conditioner in the real room. The PM2.5 healthy period and thermal comfort period was increased by around 21% and 16%, respectively, while the energy consumption was reduced by 23%, when compared with the baseline controller. Furthermore, simulations showed that the DQN controller still worked effectively when applied to other rooms with different characteristics.

According to epidemiologic evidence in recent decades, exposure to PM2.5 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 μm) can lead to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases [2,3], resulting in numerous premature deaths [1]. Additionally, thermal comfort is a critical factor in workers\u2019 productivity and satisfaction [4,5]. Given that people spend the majority of their time in indoor environments [6], controlling indoor PM2.5 and thermal comfort simultaneously is an important task. However, mitigating indoor PM2.5 with air cleaners and maintaining indoor temperature with air conditioners both consume energy [7,8], thus contributing to carbon emissions and exacerbating climate change. Therefore, it is essential to develop an energy-efficient approach for indoor PM2.5 mitigation and thermal comfort control that aligns with the goal of carbon neutrality. Natural ventilation through window opening and closing is a popular method to alter indoor PM2.5 concentration and temperature in China [7]. However, considering the uncertainty of outdoor and indoor conditions, window control alone is not sufficient to yield a satisfactory indoor environment. Closing windows could reduce the amount of external heat [9] and PM2.5 [10] that enter the room. However, when indoor PM2.5 emissions are present, it would be difficult to mitigate indoor PM2.5 pollution with windows closed. In this case, air cleaners with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters could be utilized. Air cleaners with a high clean air delivery rate (CADR) could lower the indoor PM2.5 concentration in a fast manner [7], but the air cleaning process consumes energy [11]. On the other hand, opening windows increases the ventilation rate and dilutes indoor-originated PM2.5 [12]. However, when the outdoor PM2.5 concentration and temperature are both high, the PM2.5 and heat induced by opening windows would worsen indoor PM2.5 pollution [10] and thermal comfort [13]. In this case, air cleaners could still be used for PM2.5 mitigation, and air conditioners could be utilized for maintaining a comfortable temperature, but both devices entail significant energy consumption. With the rapid development of internet of things (IoT) technology, the real-time control of smart home devices is becoming possible [14,15]. Therefore, it is worthwhile to develop an appropriate smart control method to overcome the challenges of the trade-off among indoor PM2.5 concentration, thermal comfort, and energy consumption through smart control of the window, air cleaner, and air conditioner in an indoor space. In the face of such a complex control task, several classical control methods could be considered. For rule-based control, it is typical to define some rules in advance. However, the complicated influence of the devices\u2019 action on indoor PM2.5 concentration and temperature, along with the issue of energy consumption, makes it quite challenging to determine reasonable rules. For proportional-integrate-derivative (PID) control, inappropriate selection of PID controller gains would cause system instability [16]. Therefore, the PID control is not suitable for this complicated task. For model predictive control (MPC), accurate models should be established in advance, and forecasts of weather conditions and indoor occupant behavior are needed for prediction and optimization [17], which is also very difficult. Thus, these traditional methods may not be suitable for this control task because of the trade-off among health, comfort and energy. Note that the control of window, air cleaner, and air conditioner can be treated as a sequential decision-making process. Reinforcement learning (RL), a class of machine learning technique, is very suitable for obtaining an optimal control strategy for this kind of process [18]. When combined with a deep learning algorithm, the derived deep reinforcement learning (DRL) could be adapted to more complex problems [19]. Hence, deep reinforcement learning could be employed to develop a smart controller for window, air cleaner, and air conditioner to reduce indoor PM2.5 concentration, improve thermal comfort, and save energy. Several studies have attempted to use deep reinforcement learning in the control of smart buildings [15,20\u201326]. For example, Gao et al. [20] adopted the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) to determine the setpoints for air temperature and relative humidity of a heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system, which improved thermal comfort while saving energy when compared with the baselines. Heo et al. [21] employed a deep Q-network (DQN) to train an agent in the virtual environment of a subway station, to control the inverter frequency for reducing indoor PM10 concentration with less energy consumption. The simulation results showed that, when compared with the rule-based method, the agent provided an energy saving of 14.4% and reduced the indoor PM10 level. Yang et al. [22] utilized a DQN with prioritized replay memory to control the heating/cooling power and the ventilation air volume of an HVAC system. In summer and winter, the approach could reduce energy costs by 8.6% and 7.9%, respectively, while maintaining indoor CO2 and temperature at similar levels in comparison with model predictive control in the simulation. Although these studies have provided great insights, the majority of them evaluated the performance of the deep reinforcement learning methods based on computer simulations. Few investigations have focused on experiments to demonstrate the superiority of this method. Our previous work [15] developed a controller for a window actuator and an air cleaner using a DQN algorithm to reduce indoor PM2.5 while saving more energy, and conducted experiments in laboratory chambers to prove the superiority of the DQN controller over the baseline controller. However, the results from small-scale chamber tests may not fully represent those from real room tests. Kurte et al. [24] developed a DRL controller for air conditioners and conducted field tests in a real house to verify the energy saving performance. However, this control task was less complex as it did not consider indoor PM2.5 control with an air cleaner and window. Therefore, this investigation aimed to develop a controller using a DQN algorithm for real-time control of a window, an air cleaner, and an air conditioner in a real room, in order to mitigate indoor PM2.5 pollution, maintain thermal comfort, and save more energy. First, the proposed method trained the DQN controller in a virtual room constructed from the monitoring data in the real room. To evaluate the performance of the developed controller experimentally, a field test was conducted in the real room for 4 days under various outdoor conditions with different indoor activities. In the experiments, the trained DQN controller was integrated with the window actuator, air cleaner, and air conditioner to achieve real-world smart control of the devices. The real-time indoor PM2.5 concentrations, indoor temperature, status of the window, and power of the air cleaner and the air conditioner were recorded. The experimental results were then compared with the simulation results when utilizing the DQN controller and an occupant-based baseline controller for performance assessment. 2 Methodology 2.1 Control objectives and inputs This investigation aimed to develop a method for real-time control of a window, an air cleaner, and an air conditioner in a room for indoor PM2.5 mitigation and thermal comfort maintenance with relatively low energy consumption in summer. The window enables natural ventilation, the air cleaner mitigates indoor PM2.5, and the air conditioner cools down the indoor environment in summer. The objective of the controller for the three devices is to lower the indoor PM2.5 concentration, maintain the indoor temperature within a certain range around the setpoint, and reduce the energy consumption. The inputs of the controllers are the indoor and outdoor PM2.5 concentration and temperature monitored by sensors. With the input data, the developed controller then outputs the control signal that determines the opening/closing of the window and the on/off status of the air cleaner and the air conditioner. In general, the system comprises indoor and outdoor PM2.5/temperature sensors, a window actuator, an air cleaner, an air conditioner, and a controller in the cloud server. Suitable communication protocols can be used to transfer the data among the sensors, the devices, and the server. 2.2 Deep reinforcement learning approach 2.2.1 General framework Fig. 1 illustrates the general framework of the deep reinforcement learning approach for the control of the devices, i.e., window, air cleaner, and air conditioner, in a room. First, the indoor and outdoor PM2.5 concentration and temperature are monitored in the room for a certain period of time to collect data for virtual room model construction. The collected data, together with the particle dynamics model and energy balance model, are used to construct the virtual room model. Next, the controller is trained offline in the constructed virtual room using a deep Q-network (DQN), a kind of deep reinforcement learning method. The trained DQN controller can then be applied to the room for real-time control of the devices in the room for indoor PM2.5 mitigation and thermal comfort maintenance with reduced energy consumption. 2.2.2 Construction of room model for controller training To facilitate the offline training of the DQN controller, the model for the room that mimics the dynamics of the room should be established. The room model consists of the particle dynamics model and the energy balance model. The particle dynamics model for indoor PM2.5 variation can be expressed by [27]: (1) d C in ( t ) dt = α P C out t - α C in t - CADR V C in t - k C in t + S ̇ t V where t is the time, C in ( t ) and C out ( t ) represent the indoor and outdoor PM2.5 concentration, respectively, α is the air exchange rate, P is the penetration factor, k is the particle deposition rate, S ̇ is the emission rate of the PM2.5 source, CADR represents the clean air delivery rate, and V is the room volume. Note that particle resuspension is not considered in this equation [28]. Note also that the model is to be used for the training of the controller. Therefore, it does not have to exactly replicate the indoor PM2.5 concentrations in the real world. The more important task is to ensure that the model represents the characteristics of the room that can influence PM2.5 transport, as reflected by the parameters α , P , and k . Initially, these three parameters can be assumed to be constants under a given device operation status (window/air cleaner/air conditioner on/off). So, for each action, data for periods with no indoor PM2.5 source could be obtained. Therefore, utilizing a grid search method, the values of α , P , and k can be regressed for the time periods when there is no indoor PM2.5 emission, with the goal of minimizing the root-mean-square error (RMSE) between the actual measurements and the model-generated data. The CADR can be determined when using a specific air cleaner. The S ̇ can be set according to common indoor PM2.5 emission activities. In the preliminary model, the thermal comfort is simply represented by indoor temperature, and the latent heat is not considered in this study. The indoor temperature can be expressed by: (2) ρ c p V d T in ( t ) dt = h out A out T out ( t ) - T in ( t ) + h neighbor A neighbor T neighbor - T in ( t ) + α T out t - T in t + Q ̇ in - Q ̇ ac where T in ( t ) and T out ( t ) represent the indoor and outdoor temperature, respectively, ρ is the air density which is 1.2 kg/m3, c p is the specific heat of air which is 1.02 kJ/(kg∙K), V is the volume of the room, h out is the heat transfer coefficient of the exterior walls, A out is the area of the exterior walls, h neighbor is the heat transfer coefficient of the interior walls connected to the neighboring rooms or corridor, A neighbor is the area of the interior walls, Q ̇ in represents the indoor heat from sources such as occupants and lighting, and Q ̇ ac represents the cooling provided by the air conditioner. In the preliminary model, the air conditioner control is simply on/off, i.e., the output cooling is 0 when the air conditioner is off, while the output cooling is at the maximum when the air conditioner is on. Again, the model is to be used for the training of the controller; therefore, the model represents the thermal characteristics of the room, which is reflected by the parameters h out A out and h neighbor A neighbor . Again, these parameters can be regressed using a grid search method, with the aim of minimizing the RMSE between the measured temperatures and the model-generated data. Note that the parameter α has been obtained from the regression of the particle dynamics model. The Q ̇ ac can be determined when using a specific air conditioner. The Q ̇ in can be set according to typical indoor heat generation. 2.2.3 Deep reinforcement learning approach The deep reinforcement learning approach includes an agent interacting with the environment to learn how to make optimal decisions. The approach incorprates three essential components: the state s , the action a , and the reward function r . At time t , the agent observes the current state s t , takes action a t based on its policy π a t | s t , and changes the observed state from s t to s t +1 . Next, the agent receives a reward r t for evaluation of action a t . The agent then updates its policy to maximize the total discounted future rewards G t , which balances immediate and delayed rewards using a discount factor γ . The G t can be expressed by: (3) G t = r t + 1 + γ r t + 2 + . . . + γ T - t - 1 r T where T is the ending time of the period. To estimate the the benefit of taking an action a in state s , the approach uses a value function, Q π ( s , a ) , which estimates the expected future reward of an action a in state s under the policy π ( a | s ) . The Q π ( s , a ) can be expressed by: (4) Q π ( s , a ) = E π [ ∑ k = 0 ∞ γ k r t + k + 1 | s t = s , a t = a ] where E π ( ∙ ) represents the expectation of the expression under a given policy π ( a | s ) . The deep Q-network (DQN) algorithm, a classical deep reinforcement learning method that is capable of handling continuous state spaces [29], is employed to train the agent with the aim of maximizing G t . Fig. 2 describes the architecture of the DQN algorithm. It demonstrates that the DQN incorporates two fully-connected neural networks. The behavior network with parameters w e makes decisions and interacts with the environment, while the target network with parameters w t helps upgrade the behavior network. To avoid overfitting, the DQN employs a replay memory for batch random-sampling, and it helps remove correlation between the input data in each batch. In each step, the state s t serves as an input to the behavior network. The agent then chooses an action a t based on the behavior network\u2019s output Q e ( s t , a t ∗ ) and the ε-greedy strategy, where a t ∗ represents all the actions that could be chosen. The ε-greedy strategy means choosing the action with the highest Q e ( s t , a t ∗ ) with probability ε and randomly with probability 1 - ε . The state s t , the action a t , the reward r t , and the state in the next step s t + 1 are stored in the replay memory as ( s t , a t , r t , s t + 1 ) . Every n time steps, a batch of items ( s k , a k , r k , s k + 1 ) ( m a x { t - N + 1 , 0 } ≤ k ≤ t ) are randomly sampled from the replay memory to update the behavior network. Here, N is the memory capacity. For the behavior network, the input data is s k , and the output data is Q e ( s k , a k ) . For the target network, s k + 1 serves as the input, and the maximum Q t ( s k + 1 , a k + 1 ∗ ) is the output. The loss function L k is then calculated using the reward r k , as well as the outputs of the two networks: (5) L k = r k + γ m a x Q t s k + 1 , a k + 1 ∗ - Q e ( s k , a k ) 2 For the update of the behavior network\u2019s parameters w e , this algorithm then applies the gradient descent method to the calculated L k for this update. For the update of the target network\u2019s parameters w t , the parameters w e are duplicated and used to replace w t every m time steps. The DQN algorithm can then be applied to the training of the smart controller for window, air cleaner, and air conditioner control in a room for indoor PM2.5 mitigation and thermal comfort maintenance with less energy consumption. The state s t comprises indoor and outdoor PM2.5 concentration and temperature along with the time, and the state can be expressed by: (6) s t = C in t , C out t , T in t , T out t , H o u r , M i n The action a t = ( W i n d o w t , C l e a n e r t , C o n d i t i o n e r ( t ) ) has three elements: the action of the window, Window ( t ) , the air cleaner, Cleaner ( t ) , and the air conditioner, C o n d i t i o n e r t , at time t . For each element of the action a t , there are two choices, 0 and 1, representing off and on, respectively. Therefore, the eight possible actions a t are: a t = 0 , 0 , 0 o r 0 , 0 , 1 o r 0 , 1 , 0 o r 0 , 1 , 1 (7) o r 1 , 0 , 0 o r 1 , 0 , 1 o r 1 , 1 , 0 o r 1 , 1 , 1 The reward function, R ( t ) was designed by considering indoor PM2.5, r P M 2 . 5 t , thermal comfort, r comfort t , and energy consumption, r energy t . (8) R t = - ( w 1 r P M 2 . 5 t + w 2 r comfort t + w 3 r energy t ) (9) r P M 2 . 5 t = C in t + Δ t C norm (10) r comfort t = | T in t + Δ t - T set | T upper - T lower (11) r energy t = P cleaner t + P conditioner t P cleaner , r a t e d + P conditioner , r a t e d where w 1 , w 2 , w 3 are the weights for r P M 2 . 5 t , r comfort t , and r energy t , respectively, and their sum is equal to 1. Here C norm is the reference PM2.5 concentration for normalization, T set is the indoor setpoint temperature, T upper and T lower are the upper and lower bound temperatures of the dead-band, respectively, P cleaner t and P conditioner t are the power consumption of the air cleaner and air conditioner, respectively, and P cleaner , r a t e d and P conditioner , r a t e d are the rated power of the air cleaner and the air conditioner, respectively. Note that the reward had a value in the range of −1 to 0 under most conditions, expect for very high PM2.5 concentration or a very large difference between the setpoint and the actual temperature. 3 Demonstration in a real room 3.1 Experimental setup In this investigation, the proposed smart control system and approach were demonstrated in a real room in Hong Kong. Fig. 3 shows the schematic of the experimental setup in the room. The floor area of the room was 14 m2 and the height was 3 m, so the volume of the room was 42 m3. A casement window with dimensions of 0.9 m in width and 0.8 m in height was on the exterior wall for natural ventilation. In the real room, the heat generation was relatively stable at 80 W. An air cleaner with a rated CADR of 400 m3/h and a rated power ( P cleaner , r a t e d ) of 30 W was used to remove indoor PM2.5. A portable air conditioner with fresh air and a rated power ( P conditioner , r a t e d ) of 1300 W was used to provide cooling. In the experiments, the cooling provided by the air conditioner was relatively stable at 2200 W. The actual power consumption levels of the air cleaner and the air conditioner, P cleaner t and P conditioner t , were continuously monitored using smart plugs with a time resolution of 1 min. Two light-scattering sensors were used to monitor the indoor and outdoor PM2.5 concentration, respectively, with a time resolution of 1 min. Two low-cost thermistor sensors were used to monitor the indoor and outdoor temperature, respectively, also with a time resolution of 1 min. The sensors were carefully calibrated, and the measurement resolution was 1 μg/m3 for PM2.5 concentration and 0.1 °C for temperature measurements. Arizona test dust was used with a particle generator to simulate PM2.5 source emission. A fan was used to thoroughly mix the room air. The measured indoor and outdoor data from the sensors were transferred to the server via an RS485 interface using the Modbus protocol. The DQN controller was in the server, which can take actions and send the control signals to the devices. For the on/off control of the air cleaner, the signal from the controller was transmitted directly via Wi-Fi. For the window and air conditioner, the signal was transmitted to the multi-function remote control via Wi-Fi first, and then the remote control sent the opening/closing signal to the window through radio frequency and the on/off signal to the air conditioner through infrared, respectively. The power consumption levels monitored by the smart plugs were sent to the server through Wi-Fi. 3.2 Data collection and room model The indoor and outdoor PM2.5 concentration and temperature were monitored in the room for three weeks to collect the data for virtual room model construction. With the collected data on indoor/outdoor PM2.5 concentrations and Eq. (1), the parameters α , P , and k were obtained through data regression. Based on the method developed in our previous work [14], the periods without indoor source emissions in the room were identified. The parameters α , P , and k were estimated by a gird search method with the aim of minimizing the root-mean-square-error (RMSE) between the predicted and the measured indoor PM2.5 concentrations. The results show that the RMSE was 1.91 μg/m3 and the mean-absolute-error (MAE) was 0.86 μg/m3, indicating that the estimated parameters could well represent the particle dynamics in the room. The obtained parameters are listed in Table 1 . The mechanical ventilation system in the corridor was on in the daytime and off at night, which indirectly influenced the parameters in the particle dynamic model of the room. Note that α was influenced by the window, since opening the window increased the ventilation rate. It was also influenced by the action status of the air conditioner, since the air conditioner that provided fresh air introduced air from the outdoor environment. The α was not affected by the air cleaner, since it just circulated the air in the indoor environment. Apparently, P could only be influenced by the window and not by the air cleaner or air conditioner [27]. With the collected indoor/outdoor temperature data and Eq. (2), the parameters h out A out and h neighbor A neighbor were obtained by data regression; these values were 120 W/K and 20 W/K, respectively. These parameters were also estimated by a grid search method aiming to minimize the RMSE between the predicted and the measured indoor temperature. The results show that the RMSE was 0.37 °C and the MAE was 0.29 °C, indicating that the estimated parameters could well represent the heat transfer between the room and the ambient environment. 3.3 Training of the controller for the real room The training of the DQN controller was conducted offline in the virtual room constructed from the monitoring data and Eqs. (1) and (2). The period for each episode in the training was from July 17 to Aug 8, 2022 (except for the missing data on Aug 2). Note that in the training, the input of outdoor PM2.5 concentration and temperature were the monitoring data, while the input of indoor PM2.5 concentration and temperature were calculated by the room model (Eqs. (1) and (2)) in each time step. The time resolution of the inputs was 1 min. For the output control signal, to avoid frequent opening/closing of the window and on/off of the air conditioner, the time interval for actions was set at 5 min. For the air cleaner, the time interval for actions was kept at 1 min for fast response to sudden indoor PM2.5 emissions. In the training, the PM2.5 emission rate, S ̇ , was set according to the different cooking activities with the schedule listed below. \u2022 From 0:30 to 0:50, boiling (cooking) resulted in a PM2.5 source with an emission rate of 34.8 ± 29.9 μg/min [30]. \u2022 From 8:00 to 8:20, steaming (cooking) resulted in a PM2.5 source with an emission rate of 21.8 ± 15.0 μg/min [30]. \u2022 From 11:30 to 11:50, boiling (cooking) resulted in a PM2.5 source with an emission rate of 34.8 ± 29.9 μg/min [30]. \u2022 From 14:00 to 14:07, smoking resulted in a PM2.5 source with an emission rate of 2250 ± 390 μg/min [31]. \u2022 From 16:00 to 16:05, printing resulted in a PM2.5 source with an emission rate of 61 μg/min [32]. \u2022 From 18:00 to 18:10, deep frying (cooking) resulted in a PM2.5 source with an emission rate of 197.4 ± 64.3 μg/min [30]. \u2022 From 20:00 to 20:05, printing resulted in a PM2.5 source with an emission rate of 61 μg/min [32]. Note that the purpose of setting these indoor PM2.5 emissions was to enrich the scenarios to facilitate the learning, so that the trained DQN controller would be able to deal with different emission scenarios in the field tests. The weights of the terms r P M 2 . 5 t , r comfort t , and r energy t in the reward function, w 1 , w 2 , and w 3 were set at 0.3, 0.4, and 0.3, respectively, by assuming that the user has similar preference on indoor PM2.5 mitigation, thermal comfort improvement and energy saving. Note that the weight can be adjusted to accommodate users with different preferences and the controller needs to be re-trained. The reference PM2.5 concentration, C norm , was set at 75 μg/m3; this is the daily average threshold for PM2.5 in the Chinese standard [33]. The setpoint temperature T set was set at 25 °C. The dead-band was set at 2 °C, so that the upper and lower bound temperatures, T upper and T lower , were set at 26 and 24 °C, respectively. The controller was trained using the DQN containing two fully connected neural networks, each with a size of 6 × 16 × 8. The network comprised an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. The input layer had 6 nodes to match the 6 dimensions of the state space (Eq. (6)) while the output layer had 8 nodes to match the 8 choices in the action space (Eq. (7)). Reducing the number of nodes in the hidden layer could limit the network\u2019s ability to learn the characteristics of the environment, whereas increasing the number of nodes could lead to overfitting and a longer training time. After testing of different numbers of nodes, 16 nodes were used in the hidden layer, as this number had the best performance. The learning rate ( α lr ) was set to 0.001. The ε -greedy rate ( ε ) was set to 0.95, allowing the controller to take random actions occasionally and promoting comprehensive learning. The discount rate ( γ ) was assigned a value of 0.99, considering the future reward completely. To enable the controller to recall previous mistakes, the replay memory capacity was set at 500,000. The batch size was assigned a value of 512. In addition, the DQN controller was trained every 5 time steps, while the target network\u2019s parameters were updated once every 15 time steps. Last but not least, the whole training process could last for 1,000 episodes. Among all the episodes, the controller achieving the highest average reward in one episode would be saved as the trained controller. 3.4 Field testing of the controller in a real room 3.4.1 Testing setup The field testing lasted for 4 days, from Aug 20 to Aug 23, 2022. In the daytime of Aug 20 and Aug 21 and throughout the night, the outdoor temperature was relatively low (28\u201332 °C). In the daytime of Aug 22 and Aug 23, the outdoor temperature was relatively high (32\u201338 °C). The room was located in a suburban area near the sea with relatively good air quality for Hong Kong. From Aug 20 to the daytime of Aug 22, the outdoor PM2.5 concentration was very low (less than10 μg/m3). From the nighttime of Aug 22 to Aug 23, the outdoor PM2.5 concentration was greater than 20 μg/m3. The various outdoor conditions were used to test the performance of the DQN controller. The period of time when the indoor PM2.5 concentration was lower than 10 μg/m3 (denoted as the PM2.5 healthy period) was used as an indicator of the effectiveness of indoor PM2.5 mitigation. Note that 10 μg/m3 was set as the threshold because it is the most stringent interim target of the World Health Organization (WHO); it is labeled as interim target 4. The period of time when the indoor temperature was between 24 °C and 26 °C (denoted as the thermal comfort period) was used as an indicator of the effectiveness of thermal comfort control. The total power of the air cleaner and the air conditioner was recorded by smart plugs and the total energy consumption can be calculated. The three indicators were utilized to comprehensively evaluate the DQN controller\u2019s performance. Moreover, they were compared with the results from simulations when using the DQN and a baseline controller. The baseline controller was based on a questionnaire survey about occupants\u2019 behavior in the use of windows, air cleaners, and air conditioners in summer in China. In total, 249 questionnaires were collected, and the option chosen by the most people was selected as the rule of the baseline. For air cleaners, more than 40% of people would turn on the air cleaner when the outdoor PM2.5 concentration is higher than 115 μg/m3. For air conditioners, a common dead-band of 2 °C was selected. For windows, nearly 50% of people would open windows for ventilation in the morning from 8:00 to 12:00. Therefore, the baseline controller kept the windows open during the period of 8:00\u201312:00. More than 60% of people would not open windows when the air conditioner is on. Therefore, the baseline controller kept the windows closed when the air conditioner was on. For the other time periods, according to the survey results, only when the outdoor PM2.5 concentration is higher than 75 μg/m3 would the window be closed. Otherwise, the window would be kept open by the baseline controller. 3.4.2 Testing results Note that, in the field testing, the DQN controller had already been trained; therefore, the room model was no longer required. Fig. 4 compares the indoor temperature and PM2.5 concentration under the DQN controller and the baseline controller, along with the action status of the window and the power of the air conditioner and air cleaner from 12:00 to 14:00 on Aug 23. Note that the baseline controller was applied to the room through simulation instead of experiment, because it was difficult to directly compare the two controllers in two identical real rooms under exactly the same conditions simultaneously. Therefore, experiments were conducted only for the DQN controller, while simulations were conducted for the baseline controller. To ensure a fair comparison between the two controllers, simulations were also conducted for the DQN controller as a supplement. In this period, the outdoor air temperature was higher than 32 °C, and the outdoor PM2.5 concentration was higher than 20 μg/m3. There was an indoor PM2.5 emission that lasted for 3 min at around 12:35. The DQN controller kept the air cleaner turned on to remove the indoor-originating PM2.5; thus, the indoor PM2.5 concentration decreased to 10 μg/m3 in 12 min. At around 12:40, the indoor PM2.5 concentration was still much higher than the outdoor PM2.5 concentration, but the DQN controller still kept the window closed to avoid a dramatic increase in indoor temperature, so as to maintain thermal comfort and reduce energy consumption by the air conditioner. In comparison, although the baseline controller closed the window as the DQN controller did, it did not turn the air cleaner on, which resulted in slow decay of the indoor PM2.5 concentration. When there was no indoor source, since the outdoor PM2.5 concentration was around 40 μg/m3, it contributed to most of the indoor PM2.5. The DQN controller kept the window closed to reduce the entrance of outdoor PM2.5 into the room. In addition, it turned on the air cleaner for most of the time and only turned it off when the indoor PM2.5 concentration approached 0 in order to save energy. During the 2-hour period, the DQN controller successfully controlled the indoor PM2.5 concentration below 10 μg/m3 for 1.8 h. In contrast, the baseline controller could not control the indoor PM2.5 concentration below 10 μg/m3 for all of the 2-hour period. Throughout the whole period, in order to improve thermal comfort and reduce energy consumption, the DQN controller narrowed the temperature control dead-band and kept the window closed even when the air conditioner was off. During the 2-hour period, the DQN controller successfully kept the indoor temperature between 24 °C and 26 °C, and the total energy consumption of the air cleaner and air conditioner was around 1.39 kWh in the experiment and 1.48 kWh in the simulation. In comparison, with energy consumption of 1.63 kWh, the baseline controller kept the indoor temperature between 24 °C and 26 °C for only 1.7 h. Fig. 5 compares the results from 19:00 to 21:00 on Aug 22 when the outdoor air temperature was lower than 30 °C and the outdoor PM2.5 concentration was lower than 10 μg/m3. At around 19:15, an indoor PM2.5 emission occurred and lasted for 8 min. When the indoor PM2.5 concentration surged, the DQN controller immediately turned on the air cleaner and kept it on for 22 min. It also opened the window for 10 min, even when the air conditioner was on. The DQN controller rapidly mitigated indoor PM2.5 and lowered the concentration to 10 μg/m3 in 10 min. In this case, the DQN controller opened the window because the outdoor PM2.5 concentration was very low (less than10 μg/m3), and the outdoor temperature was below 30 °C. Therefore, opening the window did not induce outdoor-originating PM2.5 but helped dilute indoor-originating PM2.5 without significantly increasing energy consumption or influencing thermal comfort. In comparison, the baseline controller also opened the window to dilute the indoor-originating PM2.5 but kept both the air conditioner and air cleaner off. Natural ventilation only could not handle such a strong indoor emission. Consequently, it took 23 min for the indoor PM2.5 concentration to decrease to 10 μg/m3. When there was no indoor PM2.5 source, since the outdoor PM2.5 concentration was quite low, neither the DQN nor baseline controller turned on the air cleaner. During the 2-hour period, the DQN controller successfully controlled the indoor PM2.5 concentration below 10 μg/m3 for 1.8 h, 20% longer than the baseline controller did (1.5 h). Throughout the whole period, the DQN controller kept the temperature dead-band at around 1 °C, while the baseline controller kept that value at 2 °C. As a result, the DQN controller had fewer overshoot issues than the baseline controller. Thus, the DQN controller successfully kept the indoor temperature between 24 °C and 26 °C for the full 2-hour period, and the energy consumption was 0.59 kWh. In comparison, with energy consumption of 0.98 kWh, the baseline controller kept the indoor temperature between 24 °C and 26 °C for a shorter period (1.6 h). Note that the energy consumption for the DQN controller calculated from the simulation (0.76 kWh) was higher than that from the experiment. This was because the simulation calculated the energy consumption by the rated power of the devices, whereas the experiment directly measured the actual power. Fig. 6 compares the results from 8:00 to 10:00 on Aug 22, when the outdoor temperature was higher than 32 °C and the outdoor PM2.5 concentration was lower than 10 μg/m3. Fig. 7 compares the results from 20:00 to 22:00 on Aug 22, when the outdoor temperature was lower than 32 °C and the outdoor PM2.5 concentration was higher than 20 μg/m3. Both comparisons show that the DQN controller more effectively mitigated indoor PM2.5, maintained thermal comfort, and reduced energy consumption than the baseline controller. Fig. 8 compares the overall performance of the DQN and baseline controllers during the 4 days of field testing, a total of 96 h. For indoor PM2.5 mitigation, the DQN controller successfully controlled the indoor PM2.5 concentration below 10 μg/m3 for around 93 h, which was 21% longer than the baseline controller did (around 77 h). For thermal comfort, the DQN controller successfully maintained the indoor temperature within the range of 24\u201326 °C for around 96 h, which was more than 16% longer than the baseline controller did (around 83 h). In regard to the energy consumption of the air cleaner and the air conditioner, the DQN controller required around 40 kWh, which was 23% lower than the baseline controller (around 52 kWh). For the total reward considering indoor PM2.5 mitigation, thermal comfort, and energy consumption together, the DQN controller achieved an average reward at around −0.17, which was around 35% greater than the baseline controller (around −0.27). In summary, the DQN controller effectively reduced the indoor PM2.5 pollution and successfully maintained the thermal comfort with less energy consumption compared with the baseline controller. 4 Discussion 4.1 Adaptability of the controller in different rooms The results above have demonstrated the superior performance of the DQN controller over the baseline controller in the real room. In practical applications, collecting the monitoring data and training the controller from scratch would be time-consuming. Therefore, it would be worthwhile to further explore whether this DQN controller trained with the monitoring data collected in one particular room can also work well in other rooms with different characteristics. This study conducted simulations for four other rooms with different air exchange rates and exterior-wall heat transfer coefficients using the trained DQN controller presented above. The simulation results were compared with those of the baseline controller for performance assessment. The key parameters of the rooms α and h out A out were increased or decreased by 20% for the four rooms (1.2 α , 1.2 h out A out ; 1.2 α , 0.8 h out A out ; 0.8 α , 1.2 h out A out ; and 0.8 α , 0.8 h out A out ) compared with the original values as listed in Table 2 . The comparison shows that, although the DQN controller trained with the monitoring data collected in the particular room was applied to various other rooms, it still outperformed the baseline controller in the PM2.5 healthy period and thermal comfort period by 18\u201322% and 15\u201318%, respectively, and provided an energy saving of 16\u201323%. Therefore, it is feasible to apply the trained DQN controller to the control of other rooms when the key parameters vary by no more than 20%. 4.2 Limitations The proposed approach still has several limitations that warrant further investigation. First, in practical applications, different occupants may have different preferences in regard to health, comfort, and energy saving. Therefore, controllers trained with different weights of the reward terms should be developed to meet different needs of the users. Second, if the DQN controller is applied to a room that is very different from the real room in this study, the improvement compared with the baseline controller may decrease. To improve the DQN controller\u2019s performance in different rooms, a possible option is to utilize online learning [34] to learn the characteristics of the new rooms. This approach merits further exploration. Third, in this work, the control of the air conditioner was simply on/off. In the future, built-in control of the air conditioner should be implemented in the system to improve the performance. Moreover, in real scenarios, the opening angle of windows can be adjusted, which would influence the pressure drop and the air exchange rate [35]. Consequently, the window opening angle would influence the outdoor-to-indoor particle transport and heat transfer. Thus, future development of the controllers should include the influence of window opening angle. In addition, most of the air cleaners available on the market have several operation modes with different CADR values. Hence, in the future work, various operation modes of air cleaner with different CADR values should be considered in the development of the controller. The multiple operation modes of air conditioner, window, and air cleaner can be included in the controller by extending the action space of the deep reinforcement learning method. Fourth, for indoor air quality, PM2.5 is not the only air pollutant. The removal of other indoor-originating air pollutants such as formaldehyde would rely on ventilation. Since CO2 is widely used to represent ventilation [36], it should be implemented in the reward function in the future. Furthermore, other environmental parameters such as relative humidity would also influence thermal comfort [37] and energy consumption. For example, when the temperature is appropriate but the relative humidity is very high, the occupants would still feel thermally uncomfortable. Therefore, predicted mean vote (PMV) or another index should be used in the reward function to better represent thermal comfort. In some cases, if the relative humidity is lower, to have the same PMV, the temperature can be higher which would save energy in air conditioner. Thus, considering relative humidity in the controller may also reduce energy consumption. In future development, to include relative humidity, Eq. (2) should be modified to include the latent heat and humidity sensors should be installed in the room. By considering relative humidity in the reward function, the deep reinforcement learning would further optimize the control by balancing between the PM2.5 mitigation, thermal comfort and energy consumption. Finally, one of the advantages of the proposed method is that there is no need to estimate the real S ̇ and Q ̇ in . Instead, we can just use the data available in the literature for the offline training. Although the S ̇ and Q ̇ in in real complex scenarios can be highly uncertain, the controller has already learned how to deal with the situation through its offline training with many S ̇ and Q ̇ in data collected from the literature in many episodes. This can be proven by the testing of the controller in laboratory chambers in our previous work [15] and also field tests in the room in this study. For example, in the field tests of the real room in this study, the S ̇ and Q ̇ in varied a lot in the 4 days. However, the experimental results demonstrated that the developed controller can still perform well even when the actual S ̇ and Q ̇ in were different from the values used in the training. In future work, more field tests should be conducted to further confirm this conclusion. 5 Conclusions This investigation aimed to develop a smart controller that could simultaneously control a window, an air cleaner, and an air conditioner in a room, with the goal of mitigating indoor PM2.5 and maintaining thermal comfort with relatively low energy consumption. A virtual room model was first constructed on the basis of monitoring data from a real room. The controller was then trained in this simulated virtual room with the use of the DQN algorithm. A control system was established in the real room, and field testing of the trained DQN controller was conducted for 4 days under various conditions. The experimental results were then compared with the simulation results when the DQN controller and an occupant-based baseline controller were used for performance assessment. Within the scope of this investigation, the following conclusions can be drawn: 1. The trained DQN controller could smartly control the window, air cleaner, and air conditioner in the real room to mitigate indoor PM2.5 concentration, maintain thermal comfort, and reduce energy consumption in the field testing. 2. The DQN controller outperformed the occupant-based baseline controller in the PM2.5 healthy period, thermal comfort period, and energy consumption by around 21%, 16% and 23%, respectively, during the 4 testing days. 3. When the DQN controller trained with the monitoring data collected in a particular room was applied to other rooms with different characteristics, it still achieved much better performance than the baseline controller in indoor PM2.5 mitigation, thermal comfort control, and energy saving.

        "dc:description": "To reduce indoor PM2.5 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 μm) pollution and maintain thermal comfort with relatively low energy consumption, this study employed deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to develop a controller that could simultaneously control the window, air cleaner, and air conditioner in a real room. First, a room model was constructed on the basis of 3-week monitoring data in the real room. The controller was then trained in a virtual room utilizing the deep Q-network (DQN) algorithm. To evaluate the effectiveness of the DQN controller in the real world, a smart indoor environmental control system was established. Field testing was conducted in the real room for 4 days. The performance of the DQN controller was compared with that of an occupant-based baseline controller. During the testing period, the trained DQN controller could smartly control the window, air cleaner, and air conditioner in the real room. The PM2.5 healthy period and thermal comfort period was increased by around 21% and 16%, respectively, while the energy consumption was reduced by 23%, when compared with the baseline controller. Furthermore, simulations showed that the DQN controller still worked effectively when applied to other rooms with different characteristics.",
