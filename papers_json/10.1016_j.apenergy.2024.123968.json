The coupling of indoor thermal environment parameters and the complexity of subsystem control pose challenges to further enhancing the energy efficiency of air conditioning systems. This study adopts a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm for optimal control of a temperature and humidity independent control system combining radiant ceiling cooling with desiccant dehumidification. In the co-simulation process, Python completes the algorithm construction and employs the system and building models constructed by EnergyPlus to achieve the training of agents. This study aims to analyse the optimisation effects of different algorithms, discuss the behavioural characteristics among multiple agents during the training process, and reveal the impact of humidity intelligent control on the energy saving and energy-use flexibility effects. Compared to conventional single-agent optimization control methods, this study integrates interdependent control actions and leverages a cooperative mechanism to enhance system optimization. Simulation results demonstrate that the method can avoid the local cognitive limitations of individual agents in dynamic environments, achieving multi-objective optimization. Notably, the humidity control agent autonomously reduces humidity to assist in lowering the supply water temperature, thereby managing high sensible heat loads while avoiding condensation risks of the radiant cooling panels. The optimized strategy reduces chiller energy consumption by 41.4%, with 16% of this reduction attributed to humidity control. Furthermore, humidity control enables the chiller to operate at varying power levels, enhancing the energy-use flexibility. This study provides a replicable and transferable solution for multi-subsystem optimal control.

This makes the low-carbon transformation of public buildings particularly urgent following the \u201ccarbon peak, carbon neutrality\u201d strategic policy. The energy consumption of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems accounts for 38% of the energy consumption in the building filed [2]. Therefore, reducing the energy consumption of HVAC systems is a significant task in the process of building decarbonization. In the post-epidemic era, efficient control of the thermal environment and air quality places additional demands on HVAC systems [3]. Thus, reducing the energy consumption of HVAC systems while meeting comfort needs remains a critical challenge. In order to reduce the energy consumption of HVAC systems, existing studies mainly focus on the system optimal control and structure optimizations. In terms of system optimal control, Model predictive control (MPC) is the most commonly used method, which uses short-term prediction models to obtain the dynamic changes of main parameters, such as energy consumption, energy efficiency, and cost, and thus guides the system operation to achieve the optimisation goals [4]. In other words, MPC works by selecting the optimal control vectors to reduce the value of the cost function [5]. MPC can handle the uncertainty and stochasticity of HVAC systems and improve energy efficiency and thermal comfort by optimising control strategies [6]. Moreover, the development of the internet of things (IoT) technology and cloud storage technology provides an opportunity for MPC applications. It can be applied in public buildings with a high degree of informatisation [7\u20139]. However, the uncertainty of input parameters has a significant impact on the optimisation effect of MPC, for example, the outdoor environment, as one of the main inputs for MPC, can significantly improve the energy efficiency of MPC in controlling the building thermal environment when obtain an accurate weather forecast [10]. In addition, MPC relies on the mathematical model of the system, which makes it difficult to adapt to changing and complex environments. Executing model requires much computational resources, which poses a challenge for real-time control [11]. The reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm without a detailed physical model can adapt to uncertain and dynamic environments through interactive learning and self-optimisation. The internal load change process resulting from the interaction of the building with the external environment and HVAC system can be considered as Markov decision process (MDP) [12]; therefore, RL has been widely applied in the HVAC field. RL algorithms are mainly applied to reduce the energy consumption of HVAC systems and improve indoor comfort [13]. RL algorithms can be generally classified into value-based and policy-based algorithms [14]. The agent in the different types of algorithms decides on control actions that maximize the expected cumulative rewards in any building and system state. The feasibility of value-based algorithms represented by Q-learning and its variant deep Q-network (DQN) algorithm for energy efficiency optimization of HVAC systems has been demonstrated by numerous studies [15,16]. For example, Chen et al. [17] used Q-learning algorithm to control building natural ventilation and air conditioning (A/C) operation, achieving energy savings while maintaining indoor comfort compared to rule-based control. Policy-based algorithms are more advantageous in scenarios with continuous control actions and high dimensional state space [18]. The policy-based deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm exhibits fast convergence and narrow fluctuation intervals during training [19]. However, in multi-zone and multi-system scenarios, the convergence speed and optimisation effect of algorithms with single agent are limited [20], and the design of hyper-parameters and state variables significantly affects the optimisation effect [21,22]. Du et al. [23] applied the DDPG algorithm to a multi-zone scenario and compared it with the DQN algorithm. The results show that the DDPG algorithm fails to achieve the expected energy savings. Therefore, the multi-agent RL algorithm provides a feasible solution in dealing with optimization problems with multi-objectives and multi-control objects [24]. HVAC systems typically involve multiple subsystems and a series of equipment, and multi-agents are able to control and optimise these subsystems separately to better cope with system complexity [25]. The value-decomposition network can address cooperative optimization of multi-agent [26]. Therefore, even if one or more agents fail, other agents can continue to optimise, thus improving the robustness and fault tolerance of the system. In high dimensional state-action space scenarios, deep clustering techniques can be utilized to accelerate the convergence of strategy learning [27]. Bayer et al. [28] used the same number of agents as the control zones to achieve the energy saving effect in multi-zone control scenarios. Jie Li et al. [29] used the multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) algorithm to control the design temperature and humidity of multi-zones, achieving 15.4% energy savings while maintaining indoor comfort. Homod et al. combined deep clustering with a multi-agent RL algorithm to help optimise load shifting in a multi-tank chilled water system and achieved a 25.47% improvement in energy efficiency compared to the traditional proportional-integral-derivative (PID) method [30]. In terms of system structure optimization, existing research has focused on system design optimisation, development of energy-efficient equipment, utilization of renewable resources and efficient thermal environment control technology. Temperature and humidity independent control (THIC) is a thermal environment control technology that achieve indoor comfort and energy saving [31]. Compared to indoor temperature feedback control, temperature and humidity feedback control increases the peak shaving ratio by 4% and the energy-saving effect by 6.4%. Additionally, the potential for energy savings from humidity control is even greater in hot and humid scenarios [32]. Numerous studies oriented towards the optimization of THIC systems. Nasruddin et al. [33] adopted a multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) to improve the thermal comfort and energy efficiency. Xie et al. [34] proposed a parametric cooperative optimization method by integrating the response surface method (RSM) and the fast non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II). The optimal parameters reduce operating costs, ensure comfort, and improve system performance. The THIC system involves heat source, transmission and distribution, and terminal subsystems, which poses a complex optimization problem. Moreover, the non-linear relationship between the indoor thermal environment parameters leads to a challenge of modelling the coupling between the building and the THIC system. Therefore, multi-agent intelligent control is promising in enhancing the energy efficiency of THIC systems. The above literature review reveals a research gap in the intersection of multi-agent based RL algorithm application and THIC system optimal control, as shown in Fig. 1 . Therefore, to address this research gap, this study aims to use the multi-agent algorithm with a cooperative mechanism to optimise the operation of THIC systems. Control strategies are designed at both the building level and the system level to explore feasible schemes that can deal with the trade-off of energy saving and comfort. The main contribution of this study can be summarised as follows: 1. Agents in existing multi-agent algorithms are generally independent of each other without interfering relationship. In present study, control agents with non-linear relationships for indoor temperature and humidity as well as supply water temperature are designed, which allows to derive the behavioural characteristics among the agents guided by cooperative control mechanisms. 2. A comparative analysis demonstrates that the single-agent algorithm fails to escape the local optimization dilemma and converge in the optimal control of THIC systems, while proving the feasibility of multi-agent RL algorithms and their robustness in dynamic environments. 3. The conventional humidity control in THIC systems aims to prevent condensation and enhance indoor comfort. This study analyses the effect of humidity intelligent control on the thermal environment and system operating characteristics. It is demonstrated that humidity intelligent control can strengthen the energy saving effect and improve the flexibility of system energy use. 2 Methods 2.1 System description and the hypothesis of system optimization This study models a THIC system utilizing high-temperature chilled water for cooling and condensing heat for desiccant regeneration. The terminal system on the indoor side consists of a radiant ceiling cooling system and a water loop-assisted hybrid desiccant cooling (WLDC) system, as shown in Fig. 2 . The WLDC consists of two chilled-water cooling coils (CC), a hot-water coil, a desiccant wheel, and fans. Chilled-water cooling coil 1 (CC1) is responsible for increasing the relative humidity of air under dry coil condition cooling, thereby enhancing the dehumidification performance of the desiccant wheel. A chilled-water cooling coil 2 (CC2) is used to regulate the supply air temperature. The THIC system operates according to a general decoupling scheme. The RCP employs on/off control with a ± 0.5 °C deadband determined by the indoor temperature setpoint. The WLDC system utilizes on/off control with a ± 1% deadband determined by the indoor relative humidity setpoint. The heat-source side employs a chiller to produce chilled water, while hot water for solid desiccant regeneration is generated by recovering condensing heat. The remaining condensing heat is released through the cooling tower. A previous experiment study [35] demonstrated the system performance in terms of energy savings and indoor thermal environment control compared to conventional THIC systems. Table 1 summarizes the main design parameters of the THIC system used in the experimental study, which are also used in this co-simulation study. In the study of applying reinforcement learning algorithms to perform optimal control of a HVAC system, it is assumed that the control of HVAC conforms to the Markov decision process (MDP). In a HVAC system, information such as current indoor temperature, humidity, and system operation state can adequately describe the current state of the system, while the future state (such as the temperature and humidity at the next timestep) is mainly determined by the current state and the current control actions (e.g., heating, cooling, and ventilation, etc.). Therefore, the control of the HVAC system satisfies the Markov property which states that the future state of the system depends only on the current state and the actions currently taken, and is independent of past states and actions. The state transfer of the HVAC system can be regarded as a probabilistic process based on the current state and actions, which is consistent with the state transfer probability in the MDP. Furthermore, in the optimal control of a HVAC system, each combination of states and actions generates an immediate reward or penalty, and this reward function can reflect the performance objectives of the system, such as energy consumption, comfort, and economic cost. This immediate reward assessment is consistent with the reward function in MDP. Assuming that the HVAC system conforms to the MDP can simplify the computation and optimisation process. Reinforcement learning algorithms, which are one of the representative algorithmic classifications in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), can be used to perform optimisation tasks and to provide intelligent control of HVAC systems. Reinforcement learning algorithms are able to decompose the complex control problem into sub-problems of selecting the best control action in each state. The agent in the reinforcement learning algorithm can be analogised to a brain. Through the continuous learning of the brain, it can make appropriate control instructions while observing the state of the HVAC system and the indoor environment. 2.2 System modelling and validation 2.2.1 Main components modelling This section describes the modelling process for the key components in the THIC system. The main equation is derived from the Engineering Reference document on the EnergyPlus software homepage [36]. (1) Desiccant wheel model. The desiccant wheel model in EnergyPlus is described by several dehumidification performance curves, as expressed in Eq. (1). The actual regeneration side outlet air state can be calculated using the regeneration side outlet air state under the full load condition and the part-load ratio (PLR), as shown in Eq. (2) to (4). (1) T ro \u2032 w ro \u2032 = b 2 b 3 b 4 b 5 b 6 b 7 b 8 c 2 c 3 c 4 c 5 c 6 c 7 c 8 w ri T ri w ri / T ri w pi T pi w pi / T pi u + b 1 c 1 (2) Δ T r Δ w r = T ro \u2032 − T ri w ro \u2032 − w ri (3) PLR = w pi − w setpoint Δ w r (4) T ro w ro = T ri + Δ T r × PLR w ri − Δ w r × PLR Subsequently, the outlet air state on the dehumidification side can be calculated using the principle of mass and energy conservation, as shown in Eq. (5). (5) T po w po = T pi − m r c p , r T ro − T ri m p c p , p w pi − m r w ro − w ri m p (2) Radiant cooling panel model. A simple method for calculating the performance of a radiant cooling panel is to use a heat exchanger style formulation. First, a heat balance on the water loop is as shown in Eq. (6). (6) Q rp = m w c p , w T wi − T wo The maximum amount of heat transfers possible according to the Second Law of Thermodynamics is calculated by the following equation: (7) Q max = m w c p , w T wi − T z where T z is a concept combined mean radiant temperature (MRT) and mean air temperature (MAT). The ratio of the actual heat exchange to the maximum possible value is known as the ε of the heat exchanger, as shown in the Eq. (8). ε can also be defined by NTU in the Eq. (9). (8) ε = Q rp Q max (9) ε = 1 − e − NTU NTU is related to the UA, then the UA value in the is formulated by Eq. (11). (10) NTU = UA m w c p , w (11) UA = − m w c p , w ln 1 − Q m w c p , w T wi − T z According to the Eq. (6) to Eq. (11), T z is an unknown variable. Based on the definition of T z , as shown in the Eq. (12), the outlet water temperature and cooling output of the cooling panel were calculated at each simulation step. (12) T z = x r MRT + 1 − x r MAT where x r is the radiant fraction for the radiant cooling panel, ranging from 0.6 to 0.7. (3) Chiller model. A chiller is mainly modelled using the performance curve and several design parameters at the reference condition. Three performance curves are used to calculate the cooling capacity and efficiency of the chiller under the off-reference conditions. Curves 1 and 2 represent the cooling capacity function and EIR (energy input to cooling output ratio) function, which are related to the leaving chilled water setpoint temperature and entering condenser water temperature, as shown in the Eq. (13). (13) f 1 f 2 = α 2 α 3 α 4 α 5 α 6 β 2 β 3 β 4 β 5 β 6 T cw , ls T cw , ls 2 T cond , e T cond , e 2 T cw , ls T cond , e + α 1 β 1 Curve 3 in Eq. (14) parameterizes the variation in the chiller input power ratio as a function of the entering condenser water temperature and part-load ratio. (14) f 3 = δ 1 + δ 2 T cond , e + δ 3 T cond , e 2 + δ 4 PLR + δ 5 PL R 2 + δ 6 T c o nd , e PLR + δ 7 PL R 3 The chilled water leaving temperature is calculated based on the Eq. (15). (15) T cw , l = T cw , e − Q ref f 1 Q avail m ̇ evap c p , eva Based on the parameters obtained from the above equations, the electric consumption of the chiller compressor can be obtained by the Eq. (16). (16) P chiller = Q ref f 1 Q avail 1 CO P ref f 2 f 3 R cycling where R cycling is the on-off cycling ratio of the chiller. 2.2.2 Model validation This section describes the model validation of the main components in the THIC system, including the desiccant wheel, radiant ceiling cooling panel, and chiller. The validation data of the desiccant wheel are obtained from the previous study [37]. The error of the temperature and humidity of the process outlet and regeneration outlet air state between the simulation results and the validation data under the same operating conditions is within ±10%. Therefore, the desiccant wheel model can reflect the changes of air state during the actual dehumidification and regeneration processes effectively. To develop an accurate model for RCPs, validation experiments were carried out in a controlled experimental chamber. During the experiment, the indoor sensible load was maintained at 320 W, and the supply water temperature was set to 18 °C. Fig. 3 illustrates a comparison between the experimental and simulated surface temperatures. The error percentage ranged from −10% to 8%, with an average error of −5.4%. These results indicate that the model can accurately represent the heat transfer process of the RCP. The chilled water coil model utilizes the same design parameters as those used in the experiments conducted in a previous study [38], which are listed in Table 2 . For the chiller model in EnergyPlus, the performance curves are developed from manufacturer information collected over a 10-year period from 1991 to 2001. The reference capacity and COP are used to calculate the actual performance of the chiller under non-reference parameters based on the performance curve. Based on the building load, a chiller with a cooling capacity of 172 kW and COP of 3.67 is selected from the EnergyPlus Reference DataSets. The key reference parameters and coefficients of the performance curves are presented in Table 3 . 2.3 System optimization control problem formulation In studies on optimal control of air conditioning systems using RL, the primary optimization objectives are comfort and energy efficiency. Much of the existing literature employs PMV as an evaluation index for indoor comfort. PMV is calculated from six parameters, four of which are environmental parameters, including temperature, humidity, air velocity, and mean radiant temperature, and two of which are individual parameters, metabolic rate and clothing insulation. Considering the building function and season, the individual parameters can be fixed values. For an office building in summer, the metabolic rate and the clothing insulation can be assumed to be 115 W and 0.5 clo, respectively. The air velocity in the case of radiative cooling can be a fixed value, which is assumed to be 0.1 m/s. Therefore, the same PMV value can correspond to different indoor temperature, humidity and mean radiant temperature values while other parameters remain unchanged. Therefore, the indoor humidity control capability of the THIC system allows PMV control more flexible. Specifically, in the THIC system using RCP as the cooling terminal, the low-temperature radiant panel surface results in a lower indoor MRT and operative temperature, consequently lowering the indoor PMV compared to a general THIC system. Therefore, the indoor temperature setpoint value can be suitably increased to achieve energy savings. Moreover, the dehumidification system mitigates the risk of condensation on the surface of radiant panels. Therefore, the primary optimization challenges for THIC systems employing RCP are as follows: 1. Enhancing energy-saving efficiency by concurrently adjusting indoor temperature and humidity while ensuring indoor comfort under varying outdoor conditions. 2. Ensuring the indoor dew point temperature remains above the surface temperature of the radiant panels during the adjustment of building and system parameters. 3. Adjusting the supply water temperature can optimise energy-saving efficiency and mitigate condensation issues; however, changes in the MRT impact indoor comfort control. In the optimization problem described above, apart from the coupling relationship between the optimization objectives, the policies of the agents also interfere with each other, as depicted in Fig. 4 . For instance, adjusting the supply water temperature inevitably influences the control of indoor temperature and dew point temperature. Indoor temperature, humidity, and MRT directly affect PMV and system energy consumption. Single-agent reinforcement learning algorithms, such as DQN and DDPG, train agents through trial and error. All agents must learn how to choose actions to maximize rewards within an environment. However, in scenarios involving multi-agents (multiple control variables), the reward each agent ultimately receives is not solely determined by its own actions but also by the actions of other agents. Consequently, the environment is unstable and not conducive to convergence. In such cases, the application of single-agent reinforcement learning algorithms to multi-agent problems is not viable. The description of the optimization problem for the THIC system above suggests a cooperative-competitive relationship among individual agents, implying that multiple agents need to achieve the optimization goal through a cooperative mechanism. This means that achieving the goal is linked to joint control achieved by integrating the control actions of individual agents. If one agent acts independently, it may hinder cooperation with other agents to obtain significant rewards. Hence, a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm is necessary to optimise the control of the THIC system. 2.4 Multi-agent deep reinforcement learning methods In a multi-agent environment, the behaviour of agents affects the decisions of other agents, thereby increasing the complexity of cooperative decision-making. This study addresses the cooperative decision-making problem using the MADDPG algorithm, which is an extension of the DDPG algorithm. To provide a clear understanding, it is necessary to describe in detail the key concepts of Q-learning, DDPG, MADDPG algorithms and the definition of Q-value. The Q-learning algorithm is a fundamental reinforcement learning algorithm that learns a value function, known as the Q-value function, which estimates the expected return (reward) of taking a specific action in a given state. It is suitable for environments with discrete action spaces. Lillicrap et al. proposed the DDPG algorithm to solve optimisation problems with a continuous action space [39]. The DDPG algorithm employs an actor-critic structure. The actor network learns a policy function that receives states observed as inputs and outputs continuous action. The critic network learns a Q-value function that receives states and actions as inputs and outputs the Q-value of the state-action pair. In other words, the actor network is responsible for choosing the control actions. The critic network is responsible for assessing how good those control actions are, and the Q-value is the quantitative metric for evaluating the control action. The Q-value represents the expected cumulative reward of taking a specific action in a given state and following a certain policy thereafter. The objective of the actor network is to maximize the Q-value estimated by the critic network. The actor network is updated using the policy gradient method, as shown in Eq. (17), where the policy gradient is calculated according to Eq. (18). (17) θ μ ← θ μ + α ∇ θ μ L Actor (18) ∇ θ μ L Actor = E s ∼ ρ π , a ∼ μ ∇ θ μ log μ a s , θ μ ∇ a Q s a θ Q where θ μ is the actor network parameter used to determine the strategy μ a s , θ μ which is the probability distribution of choosing the action a in a given state s ; ∇ θ μ L Actor is the gradient of the loss function of the actor network with respect to the θ μ ; α is the learning rate; log μ a s , θ μ is the logarithmic probability that the action a from the actor network; Q s a θ Q is the estimate of the critic network with respect to the state s and action a . The upgrade function for the parameters θ Q in the critic network is shown in Eq. (19) and Eq. (20). (19) θ Q ← θ Q + α ∇ θ Q L Critic (20) ∇ θ Q L Critic = 1 N ∑ i δ i ∇ θ Q Q s a θ Q where δ i is the temporal difference (TD) error which indicates the difference between the currently observed reward and the predicted value from critic network; N is the sample size. To enhance the stability of network updates, DDPG employs two target networks, copies of the critic and actor networks, and updates these target networks using a soft update strategy, illustrated in Eq. (21) and Eq. (22). (21) θ Q \u2032 ← τ θ Q + 1 − τ θ Q \u2032 (22) θ μ \u2032 ← τ θ μ + 1 − τ θ μ \u2032 where θ μ \u2032 and θ Q \u2032 are parameters of target actor and critic networks; τ is the soft upgrade parameter. The DDPG algorithm employs an offline learning approach. Initially, it gathers a certain amount of sample data through policy exploration and subsequently trains the actor and critic networks offline. This means that the agent first explores the environment and collects data about states, actions, and rewards without updating the networks immediately. Instead, it stores these interactions in a memory buffer known as the experience replay buffer. The experience replay technique, where all sample data are stored in an experience pool during the training process, is a notable characteristic of the DDPG algorithm. During training, samples are randomly selected from the experience replay buffer, which helps break the correlation between consecutive samples and makes the learning process more stable and efficient. This random sampling also ensures that the agent learns from a diverse set of experiences, which improves generalization. Fig. 5 shows a diagram of the DDPG algorithm during the training phase. The core concept of MADDPG is centralized training and decentralized execution. In centralized training, all agents share their experiences with each other through a common experience replay memory buffer. This buffer contains experiences from all agents, allowing them to learn from each other's interactions with the environment. Additionally, the critic network in MADDPG takes as input not only the state and action of the agent it is associated with but also the states and actions of other agents. This centralized input allows the critic to better estimate the Q-values by considering the joint actions of all agents, which enhances cooperative learning. During the execution phase, each agent independently makes decisions based on its own strategy to achieve decentralized execution. This means that once the training is complete, each agent uses only its own actor network to make decisions in real-time, without needing information about the other agents' states or actions. This approach is practical for real-world applications where agents may not have access to each other's information during execution. Fig. 6 shows a diagram of the MADDPG algorithm for the model training and execution processes. The loss function of the MADDPG algorithm is designed to consider the influence of all agents [40], as shown in Eq. (23) and (24). In a standard DDPG algorithm, the loss function for the critic network is typically the mean squared error between the predicted Q-values and the target Q-values. In MADDPG, this loss function is modified to account for the interactions between agents. Specifically, the loss function of critic network incorporates the actions of all agents, which allows it to better learn the value of joint actions in a multi-agent setting. Similarly, the loss function of actor network is adjusted to maximize the expected return, taking into account the impact of other agents' policies. This modification ensures that each policy of agents is optimized not only for its own benefit but also in a way that promotes cooperative behaviour among all agents. Table 4 shows the pseudocode of the MADDPG algorithm which presents the calculation and update process.

State variables are the parameters that can be monitored from the building and the THIC system. Action variables represent the control parameters will be performed. The reward represents the optimisation objective. The following is a description of key element design. 2.5.1 Design of the state variables State variables represent observable parameters in the environment for the agent in real engineering applications and simulations. These variables guide the agent in selecting actions that maximize rewards. In the optimization problem of the THIC system, the agents involved in the MADDPG algorithm are referred to as intelligent controllers, which correspond to different control objects, including indoor thermostats, indoor humidity controllers, and RCP supply water temperature controllers. To achieve the optimization goal, state variables must be customized for different intelligent controllers according to their functional characteristics. The state variables of the indoor thermostat are: {time, outdoor temperature, indoor temperature, solar radiation, indoor temperature deviation}, where the indoor temperature deviation is the difference between the indoor temperature and the setpoint of the thermostat. The state variables of the indoor humidity controller are: {time, outdoor relative humidity, indoor relative humidity, indoor relative humidity deviation, outdoor humidity ratio, indoor humidity ratio}, where the indoor relative humidity deviation is the difference between the indoor relative humidity and the setpoint of the humidity controller. The state variables of the RCP supply water temperature controller are: {time, indoor dew point temperature, indoor MRT, indoor OT, operation status, indoor temperature setpoint}. The state variables in the aforementioned controllers are chosen as parameters directly influencing the generation of control actions and can be monitored in real engineering. Considering the large differences in variable values, normalization is conducted during the training phase to improve the accuracy and convergence speed. 2.5.2 Design of the action variables The action variables represent the control actions and the regulation ranges that can be performed by the controller. The indoor thermostat controls the indoor temperature setpoint, which falls within the range of {24 °C\u201328 °C}. The indoor humidity controller manages the indoor relative humidity setpoint, which takes values in the range of {35%\u201365%}. The RCP supply water temperature controller regulates the water temperature setpoint, which takes values in the range of {12 °C\u201328 °C}. The lower limit corresponds to the minimum required water temperature based on the building load, while the upper limit represents the maximum acceptable indoor temperature. 2.5.3 Design of the reward function The reward function should be designed to reflect the optimization objective and the interrelationship between each optimization objective. The optimization objective in this study is to reduce the system energy consumption and avoid condensation by simultaneously adjusting indoor temperature, indoor humidity, and the supply water temperature of the RCP while meeting the comfort requirements. The agents aim to achieve common optimization goals through cooperative mechanisms. Therefore, each agent shares the same reward function, utilizing PMV as the comfort metric, chiller electricity consumption as the energy consumption metric, and the difference between the supply water temperature and indoor dew point temperature as the condensation risk metric. The specific reward functions are calculated as Eq. (9). (9) r t = α ∗ R 1 t + β ∗ R 2 t + γ ∗ R 3 t where R 1 t is the indoor comfort at the current step, which is calculated by the Eq. (10); R 2 t is the normalized electricity consumption of the chiller at the current step; R 3 t is the condensation risk of the radiant panel at the current step, which is calculated by the Eq. (11); α, β, γ are the weights representing the importance of optimisation objectives, respectively. (10) R 1 t = 1 , − 0.5 ≤ PMV t ≤ 0.5 and 8 ≤ time ≤ 18 0 , else (11) R 3 t = − 10 , RCP state t = 1 , and , T sw t < T dp t 0 , else 2.6 Optimization procedure A co-simulation platform utilizing EnergyPlus and Python is employed to conduct the optimization process. EnergyPlus, developed by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), is an open-source software capable of simulating building loads and air conditioning systems. Although it is difficult to build complex optimization algorithms in the software, the external interface function provides an interface for data transfer during the simulation process. Python can utilize a building controls virtual test bed (BCVTB) based application programming interface (API) to execute data interaction between EnergyPlus and Python. Optimal control can be achieved through reinforcement learning algorithms developed in Python. The co-simulation process is illustrated in Fig. 7 . The office building and THIC system models are modelled using EnergyPlus. EnergyPlus receives the action output from Python and executes the corresponding control actions. Afterward, the computed state variables and rewards are fed back into Python. EnergyPlus provides a computational engine that Python can access and serves as the core of the environment. Training and evaluation of the agent are performed using Python. Python initializes the environment and calls EnergyPlus to start the co-simulation. Simultaneously, it forwards the state variables read from EnergyPlus to the agents. The actions computed by the agents are transmitted to EnergyPlus as control signals, while Python receives rewards and next-step state variables calculated by EnergyPlus. The above computational process continues until the end of the simulation period, which indicates the completion of a training episode. The state variables, action variables, and rewards obtained during the co-simulation process are stored in the experience replay memory buffer. After accumulating a certain number of data samples, the data are called to train the agents. In this study, 100 training episodes will be performed, during which the agents will execute random actions to thoroughly explore the environment in the initial ten training episodes. Following every ten training episodes, an evaluation episode will be conducted to assess the training effectiveness of the agents. Once all training episodes are completed, ten testing episodes will be conducted. These testing episodes will utilize meteorological parameters that were not included in the training episodes. To mitigate the potential low robustness of agents resulting from uncertainty in the reinforcement learning process, the training-evaluation-testing procedure will be repeated five times. The entire reinforcement learning process is depicted in Fig. 8 . 2.7 Simulation scenario design This study employs a three-storey office building as the application scenario, depicted in Fig. 9 (a). The main building parameters and indoor heat gains are listed in Table 5 . Following load calculations, the TSW office zone, experiencing the highest load, is selected as the target area for implementing the THIC system. The working schedule is set from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., during which the system controls the indoor comfort. The climatic conditions of Xiamen City are adopted as the outdoor environment. In Xiamen, the average outdoor temperatures soar in July and August, reaching 27.9 °C and 27.5 °C, respectively, with the peak temperature recorded on July 30th at 37.4 °C, as illustrated in Fig. 9 (b). Consequently, August is selected as the simulation period for the training episodes, while July serves as the simulation period for the testing episodes. Table 6 lists the hyperparameters associated with the MADDPG algorithm. 3 Results and discussion To investigate the feasibility of adopting a multi-agent approach in a complex temperature and humidity independent control environment, the DDPG algorithm with the same number of agents is used as the control group. Furthermore, to demonstrate the impact of humidity control on the energy-saving performance, a MADDPG algorithm with two agents (intelligent indoor thermostat and intelligent supply water temperature controller) is trained. The indoor relative humidity setpoint is fixed at 50%. The subsequent sections analyse the results of the intelligent control simulation, focusing on changes in rewards, training effects, and optimization effects on energy consumption and indoor comfort. 3.1 Reward obtained from single and multi-agent Fig. 10 shows the evolution of the total reward for the three algorithms across 100 training episodes. The solid line represents the average total reward over the five complete training processes, while the shaded area indicates the range of standard deviations of the total reward. Due to the initial ten episodes serving as free exploration phases for the agent, there is a decline in the total reward. Following the accumulation of an adequate sample in the experience replay memory, intelligence training commences. However, due to the utilization of soft updates, the total reward shows no significant improvement during the initial training phase. Upon updating the actor and critic networks, the total reward begins to improve from the 25th episode onward. In the case of the DDPG algorithm, the total reward at the end of the training is only 2.5% higher than that at the 25th episode. The total rewards for the two scenarios employing the MADDPG algorithm experience a significant increase from the 25th episode onward. Over the subsequent 5 training episodes, the total rewards for MADDPG with 3 agents and MADDPG with 2 agents respectively rise to 93.7% and 96.5% of the total rewards at the end of training. Throughout the remaining training episodes, the total reward for MADDPG with 3 agents continues to improve by 6.3%, whereas that for MADDPG with 2 agents experiences a further improvement of only 3.5%. At the end of the training, the total reward for MADDPG with 3 agents is 5.4% higher than that of MADDPG with 2 agents. In order to elucidate the causes of the trends in the total rewards during the training of the different algorithms, Fig. 11 (a) to (c) presents the itemized analysis of the total reward, with R1 representing the comfort control reward, R2 representing the energy-saving reward, and R3 representing the reward for condensation risk avoidance. R1 reward is obtained by maintaining the indoor PMV within ±0.5. The trend of the reward of comfort sub-item shows that there is no significant increase in the R1 value in the exploration and initial training phases, as the control actions output by the agent in these phases are randomised and soft upgraded. For MADDPG with 3 agents, simultaneous randomisation of indoor temperature setpoints and relative humidity setpoints makes indoor comfort decrease in the exploration training phase and causes a greater fluctuation in R3 value. Due to the high weighting of comfort sub-item, the change in R1 dominates the trend of the total reward. Therefore, the total reward of the MADDPG with 3 agents algorithm shows a decrease in the exploration phase and a subsequent flattening in the initial training phase. The MADDPG with 2 agents in the exploration phase only performs random selection of indoor temperature setpoints within a comfort temperature range, resulting in a flat R1 value. However, due to the fixed indoor relative humidity setpoint, the random selection of the indoor temperature setpoint results in fluctuating indoor dew point temperatures and the condensation risk of RCPs. As a result, the R3 decreases during the exploration phase and the total reward is subsequently reduced. The R1 of the MADDPG algorithm rises rapidly after the start of the effective training episodes. R1 for MADDPG with 3 agents surpasses that of MADDPG with 2 agents by 2.71%. The humidity control can effectively widen the adjustable range of indoor temperature under the comfort condition constraints. Therefore, humidity intelligent control improves the fault tolerance of temperature control and reduces the impact of temperature deviation on indoor comfort. Although R1 of the MADDPG algorithm experiences a significant increase, its R2 value decreases abruptly. Subsequently, the algorithm gradually enhances the energy-saving effect of the system while ensuring comfort. Changes in the R2 reward indicate the trade-off between indoor comfort and system energy consumption. The R2 value for MADDPG with 3 agents is 15.4% higher than that of MADDPG with 2 agents, indicating superior energy-saving effect obtained from indoor humidity intelligent control. The difference in energy-saving sub-item reward explains the fact that the total reward of MADDPG with 3 agents is higher than that of MADDPG with 2 agents. In addition, through temperature and humidity regulation, the MADDPG algorithm prevents condensation on the panel surface during the training process. Thus, penalties for anti-condensation sub-item can be avoided. The DDPG algorithm as a control group fails to balance the trade-off relationship between comfort and energy consumption when dealing with multiple control subjects. Despite the indoor thermostat agent controlling the indoor temperature setpoint, the supply water controller agent elevates the supply water temperature disregarding indoor comfort to obtain the R2 reward, leading to the R1 reward nearly approaching zero. The preceding analysis demonstrates that the optimal operation of the THIC system requires cooperative control among multiple agents. Furthermore, when humidity control is involved in cooperative control, the reward of energy saving sub-item is enhanced. Subsequent analysis will investigate the training effect of MADDPG with 3 agents and the evolution of agent behaviour during the training process. 3.2 Evaluation of training effects Fig. 12 shows the evolution of indoor temperature and humidity ratio distribution across the training episodes, with the colour gradient indicating distribution density. By the 20th episode, the agent is in the initial stages of training and has not yet acquired an effective policy for optimization objectives. As a result, the distribution of indoor temperature and humidity is wide. The range of indoor temperature variation is mainly between 24 °C and 31 °C, while the indoor humidity ratio is mainly in the range of 0.01 kg/kg DA to 0.016 kg/kg DA. The indoor thermal environment is characterised by high temperature and high humidity. At the 40th episode, the indoor air state presents a concentrated distribution. The distribution of indoor temperature and humidity ratio shifts towards low temperature and low humidity ratio, with the highest point of distribution density corresponding to an indoor air state of 24.8 °C and 0.011 kg/kg DA. This suggests that although the agent has learnt an effective action strategy to control the indoor comfort, the indoor thermal environment is over-controlled and not conducive to energy saving. Moreover, the problem of the indoor temperatures exceeding 28 °C during the initial operation of the system still requires further optimization. After the next 20 training episodes, the indoor air state distribution changes further towards high temperatures. While ensuring indoor comfort, the agent rises indoor temperature for the energy saving sub-item reward, which is also reflected in Fig. 11(b). In addition, the high initial indoor temperature problem is also optimized. By the end of the training, the high-density points of indoor air state distribution further shift towards high temperatures and humidity ratios, with the lower limit of humidity ratio distribution raised to 0.0105 kg/kg DA. Changes in the indoor air state distribution during the training process clearly demonstrate that the agent is able to autonomously recognize overheating of indoor temperature at the start of the workday and regulate indoor air state while considering energy-saving objectives. Fig. 13 shows the evolution of indoor PMV distribution during training. For the conditions of obtaining the comfort sub-item reward, there is no induced design in the reward function. As long as the PMV value is within ±0.5, the comfort sub-item reward is obtained. However, the PMV values during training gradually approached +0.5 and the PMV distribution changed from flat to centralized. This trend proves that the agent is able to autonomously obtain energy savings by increasing the PMV values within the comfort range. At the end of training, the peak of the PMV distribution rises from −0.1 to 0.25, and the PMV values are predominantly distributed from −0.1 to 0.5. It is worth noting that the agent does not just keep the PMV values close to 0.5, but keeps the maximum value at the 0.5 level, which preserves the control redundancy and improves the robustness of the control strategy in unknown environments. Fig. 14 shows the energy consumption and operation time variation of the chiller during training. During the disordered control in the exploration stage, the indoor air temperature is high and exceeds the comfort range, as shown in Fig. 12 (a). Therefore, the chiller presents a low total energy consumption and a short operaiton time. The indoor thermal environment at the 40th episode is over-controlled, which causes the total chiller energy consumption to peak during training. Subsequently, the agent gradually optimizes the chiller energy consumption. Eventually, the energy consumption is reduced by 30%. The chiller operation time at the end of training is reduced by 11% from the peak. The change in the supply water temperature directly affects the power distribution of the chiller. In the exploration and initial training phase, the power distribution of the chiller has no obvious features due to the random and soft update of the action strategy, as shown in Fig. 15 . At the 40th episode, the over-control of the indoor thermal environment causes the power distribution of the chiller to be concentrated at 2300 W. With the updating of the action strategy, the power distribution of the chiller is gradually transformed from a single peak with high power to a bimodal peak dominated by low power. As a result, the energy consumption of the chiller is reduced. The THIC system under optimal control can operate at different power levels while maintains indoor comfort, which is conductive to achieve flexible energy use in the system. The analysis above proves that the MADDPG algorithm enables different agents to learn cooperative control strategies. Multi-agents can effectively improve the energy-saving effect of the system while maintaining indoor comfort. In addition, the non-radical training results allow the agent to have certain adaptability and robustness under unknown conditions. The subsequent section analyses the optimization effect and control behaviour of the agent in the test episodes. 3.3 Comparison of optimisation effects Fig. 16 shows energy consumption and power distribution of the chiller under different control algorithms during the testing episodes, with the baseline representing chiller energy consumption under fixed temperature and relative humidity setpoint conditions (26 °C, 50%). The bar in the figure represents the histogram of the chiller power, and the yellow curve is the corresponding kernel smooth distribution curve. Compared with the baseline case, MADDPG with 3 agents and 2 agents can reduce chiller energy consumption by 41.4% and 25.4%, respectively. In other words, intelligent control of relative humidity reduces chiller energy consumption by a further 16%. Moreover, the chiller power distribution under the control of MADDPG with 2 agents is unimodal, indicating that although adjusting indoor temperature and supply water temperature can decrease chiller power, the available regulation range of power is narrow. With the addition of the humidity control agent, the collaboration mechanism between the three agents allows the chiller to achieve energy flexibility, as reflected by the increased range of chiller power distribution and a bimodal distribution. The total cooling energy demand of the chiller optimized by the MADDPG algorithm experiences significant reduction. Compared with the baseline, the total cooling energy demand under the control of the MADDPG with 3 agents and MADDPG with 2 agents reduce by 43% and 34% respectively, as shown in Fig. 17 (a). In addition, the total latent energy handled by the dehumidification system under two MADDPG algorithms is reduced by 44.5% and 55.4%, respectively, compared to the baseline case. Within the acceptable PMV range, MADDPG with 3 agents can raise the upper limit of the adjustable indoor air temperatures through flexible regulation of humidity, thus reducing the cooling energy demand and increasing the dehumidification load. This feature that can be illustrated by the sub-system operation time shown in Fig. 17 (b). The operation time of the dehumidification system under MADDPG with 3 agents is double that under MADDPG with 2 agents, while the operation time of the RCP system is reduced by 13%. It can be judged the control behaviour of the agent tends to utilize dehumidification with low energy consumption to decrease energy consumption and operation time of the cooling system, thereby directly impacting chiller energy consumption. Fig. 18 shows the variation of the indoor thermal environment resulting from the control behaviour of various agents in MADDPG with 3 agents. The simulation data is selected for the week in which the highest outdoor temperature occurs. The shaded areas in the Fig. 18 indicate the worktime. Control of indoor comfort during non-working hours will not be rewarded. Therefore, although the agent representing the indoor thermostat has the behaviour of catering to indoor comfort needs by lowering the temperature setpoint during non-working hours, the agent representing the supply water temperature controller can reduce the chiller energy consumption by increasing the supply water temperature. This cooperative behaviour avoids the energy consumption on unrewarded control action and obtains the energy-saving reward. Notably, the supply water temperature begins to decrease before worktime and the indoor temperature drops below 28 °C at the beginning of worktime. The agent representing the supply water temperature controller learns control behaviours that predict indoor temperature and optimise indoor comfort through pre-cooling. In addition, the action policy of the agent reflects the coupling relationship between outdoor temperature change and supply water temperature regulation. The supply water temperature can be flexibly regulated within the setpoint value range before the outdoor temperature reaches the intraday peak. The indoor sensible load gradually increases with the increase in outdoor temperature. Therefore, the adjustable range of the supply water temperature is gradually narrowed. After the outdoor temperature reaches the intraday peak, the supply water temperature is controlled at a level close to the lower limit to meet the indoor sensible load. Under the same indoor relative humidity level, the indoor dew point temperature rises with increasing indoor temperature, posing a risk of condensation on the surface of the radiant panel when lowering the supply water temperature. Thus, the agent representing the indoor humidity controller ensures that the RCP can operate without the risk of condensation even at a low supply water temperature by reducing indoor relative humidity. From the actions of individual agents, it can be concluded that cooperative control enhances the stability of system optimization. Even in cases of inappropriate control actions by individual agents, others will adjust their actions considering common optimization objectives, thereby sustaining the trend of improved optimization. 4 Conclusions In this study, a reinforcement learning method is utilized for the multi-objective optimal control of the THIC system. The study illustrates the benefits of cooperative control by comparing and analysing the performance of single-agent and multi-agent algorithms. It explores how decision-making evolves in the multi-agent algorithm and highlights the significance of humidity control in decreasing system energy use and improving control flexibility. The main conclusions are drawn from the three aspects of algorithm applicability, behavioural characteristics and optimisation effectiveness. The cognitive limitation of individual agents in DDPG algorithm leads to the unexpected control decisions for the optimal control of the THIC system. The MADDPG algorithm can effectively handle the trade-off relationship between comfort and energy consumption through the cooperative mechanism within agents and maintain the robustness. Moreover, cooperative mechanisms allow agents to avoid localised dilemmas and obtain a pre-cooling strategy to reduce indoor thermal discomfort during the initial operation of the system. In addition, in order to maintain indoor comfort, the humidity control agent assists the supply water temperature agent in lowering the adjustable lower limit by reducing indoor humidity under high load conditions. The MADDPG algorithm reduces the energy consumption of the chiller by 41.4%. Dynamic control of indoor relative humidity allows the chiller power to be varied over a wide range, which contributes to the flexibility of the demand for external electricity. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of cooperative mechanisms between control actions to enhance optimisation, and promotes the development of system optimisation from a single control task to a globally personalised multi-control task. The adopted research methodology provides a transferable and replicable solution for the intelligent control of THIC systems. In future study, an in-depth discussion of optimisation methods in terms of scenario applicability and robustness boundaries is necessary. Scenario applicability can be refined into external environment and application scenario changes. The power grid system, as the external environment for THIC system, will be a renewable energy dominated energy structure in the future. The uncertainty of renewable energy generation highlights the energy flexibility on the power demand side. Therefore, whether the power flexibility of the chiller obtained from the optimisation in this study can meet the energy flexibility requirement needs to be further investigated. In multi-zone application scenarios, individualised control of different rooms and global optimal control of the system will multiply the control actions, therefore, the optimisation effect and the simplification methods need to be analysed in depth. Outdoor meteorological parameters have a crucial impact on the optimisation effectiveness, and the cooperative mechanism allows the trained agent robust to climate change. The boundaries of this robustness in different climates represent the feasibility of the agent, which should be defined in a subsequent study.

        "dc:description": "The coupling of indoor thermal environment parameters and the complexity of subsystem control pose challenges to further enhancing the energy efficiency of air conditioning systems. This study adopts a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm for optimal control of a temperature and humidity independent control system combining radiant ceiling cooling with desiccant dehumidification. In the co-simulation process, Python completes the algorithm construction and employs the system and building models constructed by EnergyPlus to achieve the training of agents. This study aims to analyse the optimisation effects of different algorithms, discuss the behavioural characteristics among multiple agents during the training process, and reveal the impact of humidity intelligent control on the energy saving and energy-use flexibility effects. Compared to conventional single-agent optimization control methods, this study integrates interdependent control actions and leverages a cooperative mechanism to enhance system optimization. Simulation results demonstrate that the method can avoid the local cognitive limitations of individual agents in dynamic environments, achieving multi-objective optimization. Notably, the humidity control agent autonomously reduces humidity to assist in lowering the supply water temperature, thereby managing high sensible heat loads while avoiding condensation risks of the radiant cooling panels. The optimized strategy reduces chiller energy consumption by 41.4%, with 16% of this reduction attributed to humidity control. Furthermore, humidity control enables the chiller to operate at varying power levels, enhancing the energy-use flexibility. This study provides a replicable and transferable solution for multi-subsystem optimal control.",
