This paper contains field tests and comparative studies on the operation performance of HVACs in two super high-rise buildings and summarized representative issues accounting for the high energy consumption. Field test results showed that the annual energy efficiency of the whole HVAC system, before being commissioned, was only 1.79 and 2.15 in two projects. The HVACs, typically VAV systems, chilled and cooling water systems, all suffered from over-supplying and energy wasting. Besides, the chillers commonly operated with a low partial load ratio ( PLR ), whose energy performance was much lower than expected. Aiming to dig out the typical issues, analyses were carried out from external, internal factors, and their interconnection. Furthermore, optimization methods were put forward with corrected vital indexes. Results showed that proper control strategies should maintain the VAV system, multistage chilled and cooling water system operating with significant distribution temperature differences, tiny distribution pressure drops, and high energy efficiency, thus achieving energy saving and ensuring space cooling effects. Besides, the control strategies, especially the number control of chillers, were influential during the whole cooling season to ensure the chillers operate with optimal PLR and thus achieve better energy performance.\n\nResults\n2 Analysis on the energy consumption and performance of HVACs 2.1 System description The studied projects are all located in the hot summer and warm winter zone of China, where the building cooling demand lasts for almost the whole year. Table 1 shows the basic information. Project A comprises a tower and a podium, with an overall floorage of 458,000 m 2 . The tower has the primary function of an office building, with 118 floors, 597 m in height, and a floorage of 320,000 m 2 . The podium has the main function of a shopping mall, with ten floors and a floorage of 53,000 m 2 . Besides, the underground B5-B1 floors are logistic areas with garage and equipment rooms, and the floorage reaches 85,000 m 2 . Project B is an office building with four floors underground and 67 floors above ground, and the total building floorage reaches 142800 m 2 . As for the HVACs in terminals of studied projects, the variable air volume (VAV) system is applied in the office building. In the shopping mall and logistics area, there is a constant air volume (CAV) system in landlord area and a fan-coil unit (FCU) system in tenant area. Fig.1 then shows the water system of HVACs in Project A. The ice-storage system is applied for space cooling and includes four direct-supply chillers and five ice-storage chillers. The designed cooling power of the project is 45400 kW, and the designed ice-storage capacity reaches 140,680 kWh. Besides, the chilled water system in cooling station is divided into primary side and secondary side with a bypass pipe to satisfy the cooling demand with different building functions. Furthermore, the chilled water systems in the tower terminals are divided into seven zones, as the tower has a height of 597 m. As shown in Fig.1 , only Zone 1 is directly connected to the chilled water system in cooling station. Zones 2,3 and the podium are connected with cooling station through one-stage heat exchangers. Besides, Zones 4–7 are connected to the cooling station through two-stage heat exchangers. Fig.2 then shows the water system of HVACs in Project B, which uses a conventional chiller system. The designed cooling power of the project is 32670 kW. The chilled water system is divided into upper-floor and lower-floor areas, with the heat exchangers on the 35th floor. The CHWP-L serves the lower-floor area from the 2nd floor underground to the 34th floor, and CHWP-H serves the upper-floor area from the 37th floor to the 67th floor. For each floor, the chilled water system is divided into branch N to satisfy regular space cooling demand and branch E to satisfy the cooling demand of the data center. Besides, the cooling water system is specially designed, and the CTs are installed at the rooftop of 68F. Project B is located in an island city where freshwater resources are precious; thus, seawater is used for circulation in open CTs. Besides, considering the pressure-bearing demand, the two-stage heat exchange systems are installed between CTs and CHs, and the freshwater serves as cooling water in the secondary cooling water system and condensers. Tables 2 and 3 then list the basic information of main devices in cooling station of projects A and B. 2.2 Field tests and analysis methodology As part of analyzing the energy performance of HVAC systems in two projects, field tests were conducted to identify common issues in HVAC systems for super high-rise buildings. As shown in Fig. 1 ∼ 2, during the field tests, the water temperature, flow rate, and pressure of the chilled water system and cooling water system were monitored with time intervals of 10 min. Besides, the electric consumption of chillers, water pumps and cooling towers was obtained from local monitoring systems. After obtaining the operation parameters, some indexes were raised to evaluate the energy performance of the whole system: 1) The energy efficiency ( COP ) is a crucial parameter revealing the energy performance of chillers, which could be calculated using Eq. (1) : (1) COP = Q e W ch where COP is the operating energy efficiency of the chiller; Q e represents the cooling power provided by chillers, with unit kW; and W ch is the electric power of the chiller, with unit kW. The practical operation of chillers follows an ideal reverse Carnot cycle. However, there is also a certain deviation from the ideal cycle. Therefore, the practical COP can be decomposed into the product of the ideal coefficient of performance ( ICOP ) and the thermal perfection ( DCOP ). The ICOP is the refrigeration energy-efficiency coefficient of the ideal refrigeration cycle (reverse Carnot cycle) under a certain operating condition, which is the upper limit of the chiller energy efficiency. And the ICOP is directly determined by the evaporating and condensing temperatures of the refrigeration cycle, as shown in Eq. (2) . A higher T e with a lower T c contributes to a higher ICOP . The DCOP is the ratio of the COP to ICOP , as shown in Eq. (3) , which reflects the difference between the practical and ideal energy efficiencies of the chillers, as well as the internal efficiency of the chillers. (2) ICOP = T e + 273.15 T c - T e (3) DCOP = COP ICOP = f ( T ce , P L R ) where T c and T e are the condensing and evaporating temperatures respectively, with unit ℃; T ce is the condensing and evaporating temperature difference with unit ℃, which could be applied to represent the compression ratio of chillers. PLR is the partial load rate of a chiller, which is calculated with Eq.(4), (4) PLR = Q e Q e , r where Q e , r is the rated cooling power of chillers, with unit kW. The DCOP reflects the internal efficiency of the chillers, which is equal to the compressor efficiency under conditions with a specific T ce and PLR . For a constant-speed centrifugal compressor, the cooling power of the chiller is adjusted by opening the inlet guide valve (IGV) to adjust the flow rate of the refrigerant. With a decrease in the PLR and compressor ratio, the IGV opening decreases, leading to a decrease in the compressor efficiency. Therefore, for constant-speed centrifugal chillers, control strategies should be adopted to keep the chillers operating at a high PLR and rated compressor ratio to realize high DCOP values [30] . 2) The water transport factor was raised to evaluate the energy performance of chilled water systems ( WTF ch ), cooling water systems ( WTF c ), and cooling towers ( WTF ct ), as described in Eqs (5)-(7), (5) WTF ch = Q e W ch (6) WTF c = Q e W c (7) WTF ct = Q e W ct where W ch , W c , and W ct represent the electric power of chilled water pumps, cooling water pumps and cooling towers, with unit kW. Then taking a chilled water system for example, the water transport factor could be further analyzed with Eq. (8) , (8) WTF ch = Q e W ch = C ∙ G ch ∙ dT ch G ch ∙ g ∙ H ch η ch = K ch ∙ dT ch ∙ η ch H ch where C is the water heat capacity in kJ/(kg·℃), G ch is the chilled water flow rate in kg/s, dT ch is the temperature difference between supply and return chilled water in ℃, g is the gravity coefficient in m/s 2 , H ch is the head of chilled water pumps and also the pressure drop of the chilled water systems in kPa, η ch is the energy efficiency of chilled water pumps, and K ch is the constant coefficient calculated by C and g . It can be observed that the WTF ch is directly determined by Δ t ch , η ch , H ch , and the higher value of Δ T ch , η ch , and the lower value of H ch contributes to the higher value of WTF ch , which means the better energy performance of chilled water system. 3) The air distribution factor was raised to evaluate the energy performance of air systems ( ATF a ), as described in Eq. (9) , (9) ATF a = Q e W a where W a represents the electric power of fan in air handling unit (AHU), with unit kW. Then the ATF a could also be analyzed with Eq. (10) , (10) ATF a = Q e W a = G a ∙ d h G a ∙ g ∙ H a η a = dh ∙ η a g ∙ H a where G a is the air flow rate in kg/s; dh is the supply and return air enthalpy difference in kJ/kg; H a is air distribution resistance in Pa; η a is the energy efficiency of fan. It can be observed that the ATF a is directly determined by dh , η a , H a , and the higher value of dh , η a , and the lower value of H a contributes to the higher value of ATF a , which means the better energy performance of air system. During the field test, as there are too many AHUs in buildings, the dry-bulb temperature and humidity of supply and return air for each AHU are difficult to measure, and the dh is difficult to calculate. Therefore, the monitored supply and return air temperatures were collected from the local building monitoring system, and the air dry-bulb temperature difference ( dT a ) was used to reflect the relative magnitudes of dh . Furthermore, for transient values of COP , WTF ch , WTF c , WTF ct , and ATF a , the transient cooling power and electric power of chillers, chilled water pumps, cooling water pumps, cooling towers and fans were used to calculate the relevant values. For average values of energy performance indexes within a specific time period, the accumulated cooling capacity and accumulated energy consumption of relevant devices were used to calculate the relevant values. 4) Considering the pressure-bearing demand of water systems, heat exchangers are commonly applied in super high-rise buildings. To ensure the space cooling effect, the approaching temperature ( Δ T he ) of heat exchangers should be lower enough to decrease the secondary supply water temperature. As shown in Eq. (11) , the Δ T he represents the temperature difference between secondary supply water temperature ( t s , s ) and primary supply water temperature ( T p , s ), (11) Δ T he = T s , s - T p , s Then the heat transfer process of heat exchangers could be further analyzed with Eq.(12), (12) Q e = K he ∙ T s , s - T p , s - T s , r - T p , r ln T s , s - T p , s T s , r - T p , r = K he ∙ Q e G p C - Q e G s C ln Δ T he Δ T he - ( Q e G p C - Q e G s C ) Where K he is the equivalent heat transfer coefficient of heat exchangers in kW/℃; T s , s and T s , r represent the secondary supply and return water temperature in ℃; T p , s and T p , r represent the primary supply and return water temperature in ℃; G p and G s represent the primary and secondary chilled water flow rate, in kg/s. When G p and G s have the different values, set G = Q e G p C - Q e G s C , the Eq. (12) could be further calculated as Eq. (13) , (13) Δ T he = G e K he ∙ G Q e - 1 + G Then when G p equals to G s , the Eq. (12) could be further calculated as Eq. (14) , (14) Δ T he = Q e K he Obviously, increasing the K he , matching the G p and G s can decrease the Δ T he of heat exchangers, thus leading to the better space cooling effect of the whole system. Therefore, as shown in Fig. 3 , the analysis and optimization methods for water and air systems in HVACs could be classified into external factors, internal factors, and synergy control. 1) As for chillers [29] , the external factors refer to the cooling demand of the buildings and the specific operating conditions of the chilled-water and cooling-water sides. When the Q e is fixed, the higher T e and lower T c both contribute to the better energy performance of chillers. Then, the internal factors mainly refer to technical parameters or performance characteristics. For chillers, the internal factors include the adjustment performance of the compressor at different PLR and T ce . As mentioned above, the constant-speed compressor only adjusts the IGV opening to fit the variation in the PLR and compressor ratio; thus, with a decrease in the PLR and T ce , the IGV opening decreases and leads to a decrease in the compressor efficiency. So, the synergy control for chillers refers to the fact that under operation conditions with a specific Q e , the control of chillers, especially the number in operation, should be adjusted to obtain the optimal operation PLR to ensure that each chiller operates with a high DCOP . 2) As for the chilled water system, cooling water system, and air system [21] , the external factors refer to the distribution flow rate ( G ch , G c or G a ) and resistance ( H ch , H c or H a ) of the system. When the cooling power and heat exhaust are confirmed, the distribution flow rate ( G ch , G c or G a ) should be regulated to ensure that the distribution temperature differences ( dT ch , dT c or dT a ) meet the set value, avoiding the excessive water flow rate. Then the unreasonable resistance should be eliminated to decrease the H ch , H c or H a as much as possible. Additionally, the internal factors refer to the energy efficiency of water pumps and air fans. So, the synergy control for water and air systems refers to the fact that under operation conditions with a specific distribution flow rate and resistance, the operation numbers and frequency of water pumps and air fans should be adjusted to reach the relatively highest energy efficiency. 3) As for the heat exchangers, to ensure the space cooling effect, the approaching temperature ( Δ T he ) of heat exchangers should be lower enough to decrease the secondary supply water temperature. The external factors refer to the primary and secondary water flow rate ( G p and G s ), and the internal factor refers to the equivalent heat transfer coefficient ( K he ) under different G p and G s . So, the synergy control for heat exchangers refers to that during operation, the heat exchangers should be all opened to increase the heat transfer area, which contributes to the increasing of K he . Then the G p should be adjusted to ensure the lower value of Δ T he . 2.3 Analysis on the annual energy performance of HVACs Based on the building management system (BMS), the annual accumulated cooling capacity and electricity consumption of HVACs for Project A (2021) and Project B (2019) were obtained and analyzed. Fig. 4 then illustrates the accumulated cooling capacity per day. The space cooling period lasts for the whole year, and the accumulated cooling capacity of Project A reached 56.15 GWh in 2021, where the accumulated cooling capacity of the ice-storage system and direct-supply chillers reached 29.75 GWh and 26.41 GWh, accounting for 53.0 % and 47.0 % respectively. Besides, the accumulated cooling capacity of Project B reached 33.57 GWh in 2019. Using space cooling areas as a comparison, which are 373000 m 2 in Project A and 142800 m 2 in Project B, the accumulated cooling capacity per area reached 150.5 kWh/m 2 in Project A and 235.1 kWh/m 2 in Project B. Fig. 5 then shows projects A and B's annual accumulated electricity consumption. The accumulated electricity consumption of HVACs in Project A reached 31.44 GWh in 2021, and the value per area reached 84.30 kWh/m 2 . Where the energy consumption of ICHs, air system and DCHs were top three, which reached 9.34 GWh, 9.25 GWh and 5.07 GWh, and accounted for 30 %, 29 %, 16 % of the total values. Besides, the energy consumption of multistage chilled water system, including ICHGPs and IGPs, reached 3.91 GWh and also accounted for a considerable portion (13 %). In addition, the accumulated electricity consumption of HVACs in Project B reached 15.62 GWh in 2019, and the value per area reached 109.4 kWh/m 2 . Where the energy consumption of CHs, air system and multistage cooling water system were top three, which reached 6.77 GWh, 5.43 GWh and 2.28 GWh, and accounted for 43 %, 35 %, and 15 % of the total values. It can be seen that the chillers and air system consume more than 70 % electricity of total values and are the fundamental objects of energy conservation. Besides, as the cooling and chilled water systems are designed multistage in super high-rise public buildings, they should also be paid more attention to energy conservation. With detailed accumulated cooling capacity and electricity consumption of HVACs, the annual energy performance of critical devices and sub-systems could be calculated and analyzed, results are shown in Table 4 . As for Project A, the yearly average COP of ICHs and DCHs reached 3.19 and 5.21, which were lower than the rated values. Besides, as the chilled water system was designed multistage, the average WTF of chilled water systems was only 26.22, which showed poor energy efficiency. In comparison, the annual average COP of CHs in Project B reached 4.96. As the cooling water system was designed multistage, the average WTF of cooling water systems was only 14.57. In addition, the average ATF of air systems in projects A and B were 6.07 and 6.18, which also need improvement. It can be seen that the high-class office rooms in super high-rise buildings need higher indoor environment quality, and the closed windows make it hard to utilize fresh air for free cooling in transition seasons. Thus, the space cooling capacity of high-rise buildings is much larger than that of conventional office buildings. Then, due to the super high-rise building structure, the cooling and chilled water systems are specially designed to be multistage, and the energy consumption of water pumps is bound to be higher. As analyzed in Table 4 , the energy performance of HVACs was not as good as expected. Then, this paper will explore the typical issues leading to higher energy consumption with methodology and indexes raised in section 2.2 , to guide the optimal design and efficient operation of HVACs in super high-rise buildings.\n\nMethods\n2.1 System description The studied projects are all located in the hot summer and warm winter zone of China, where the building cooling demand lasts for almost the whole year. Table 1 shows the basic information. Project A comprises a tower and a podium, with an overall floorage of 458,000 m 2 . The tower has the primary function of an office building, with 118 floors, 597 m in height, and a floorage of 320,000 m 2 . The podium has the main function of a shopping mall, with ten floors and a floorage of 53,000 m 2 . Besides, the underground B5-B1 floors are logistic areas with garage and equipment rooms, and the floorage reaches 85,000 m 2 . Project B is an office building with four floors underground and 67 floors above ground, and the total building floorage reaches 142800 m 2 . As for the HVACs in terminals of studied projects, the variable air volume (VAV) system is applied in the office building. In the shopping mall and logistics area, there is a constant air volume (CAV) system in landlord area and a fan-coil unit (FCU) system in tenant area. Fig.1 then shows the water system of HVACs in Project A. The ice-storage system is applied for space cooling and includes four direct-supply chillers and five ice-storage chillers. The designed cooling power of the project is 45400 kW, and the designed ice-storage capacity reaches 140,680 kWh.

Furthermore, the chilled water systems in the tower terminals are divided into seven zones, as the tower has a height of 597 m. As shown in Fig.1 , only Zone 1 is directly connected to the chilled water system in cooling station. Zones 2,3 and the podium are connected with cooling station through one-stage heat exchangers. Besides, Zones 4–7 are connected to the cooling station through two-stage heat exchangers. Fig.2 then shows the water system of HVACs in Project B, which uses a conventional chiller system. The designed cooling power of the project is 32670 kW. The chilled water system is divided into upper-floor and lower-floor areas, with the heat exchangers on the 35th floor. The CHWP-L serves the lower-floor area from the 2nd floor underground to the 34th floor, and CHWP-H serves the upper-floor area from the 37th floor to the 67th floor. For each floor, the chilled water system is divided into branch N to satisfy regular space cooling demand and branch E to satisfy the cooling demand of the data center. Besides, the cooling water system is specially designed, and the CTs are installed at the rooftop of 68F. Project B is located in an island city where freshwater resources are precious; thus, seawater is used for circulation in open CTs. Besides, considering the pressure-bearing demand, the two-stage heat exchange systems are installed between CTs and CHs, and the freshwater serves as cooling water in the secondary cooling water system and condensers. Tables 2 and 3 then list the basic information of main devices in cooling station of projects A and B.\n\nMethods\n2.2 Field tests and analysis methodology As part of analyzing the energy performance of HVAC systems in two projects, field tests were conducted to identify common issues in HVAC systems for super high-rise buildings. As shown in Fig. 1 ∼ 2, during the field tests, the water temperature, flow rate, and pressure of the chilled water system and cooling water system were monitored with time intervals of 10 min. Besides, the electric consumption of chillers, water pumps and cooling towers was obtained from local monitoring systems. After obtaining the operation parameters, some indexes were raised to evaluate the energy performance of the whole system: 1) The energy efficiency ( COP ) is a crucial parameter revealing the energy performance of chillers, which could be calculated using Eq. (1) : (1) COP = Q e W ch where COP is the operating energy efficiency of the chiller; Q e represents the cooling power provided by chillers, with unit kW; and W ch is the electric power of the chiller, with unit kW. The practical operation of chillers follows an ideal reverse Carnot cycle. However, there is also a certain deviation from the ideal cycle. Therefore, the practical COP can be decomposed into the product of the ideal coefficient of performance ( ICOP ) and the thermal perfection ( DCOP ). The ICOP is the refrigeration energy-efficiency coefficient of the ideal refrigeration cycle (reverse Carnot cycle) under a certain operating condition, which is the upper limit of the chiller energy efficiency. And the ICOP is directly determined by the evaporating and condensing temperatures of the refrigeration cycle, as shown in Eq. (2) . A higher T e with a lower T c contributes to a higher ICOP . The DCOP is the ratio of the COP to ICOP , as shown in Eq. (3) , which reflects the difference between the practical and ideal energy efficiencies of the chillers, as well as the internal efficiency of the chillers. (2) ICOP = T e + 273.15 T c - T e (3) DCOP = COP ICOP = f ( T ce , P L R ) where T c and T e are the condensing and evaporating temperatures respectively, with unit ℃; T ce is the condensing and evaporating temperature difference with unit ℃, which could be applied to represent the compression ratio of chillers. PLR is the partial load rate of a chiller, which is calculated with Eq.(4), (4) PLR = Q e Q e , r where Q e , r is the rated cooling power of chillers, with unit kW. The DCOP reflects the internal efficiency of the chillers, which is equal to the compressor efficiency under conditions with a specific T ce and PLR . For a constant-speed centrifugal compressor, the cooling power of the chiller is adjusted by opening the inlet guide valve (IGV) to adjust the flow rate of the refrigerant. With a decrease in the PLR and compressor ratio, the IGV opening decreases, leading to a decrease in the compressor efficiency. Therefore, for constant-speed centrifugal chillers, control strategies should be adopted to keep the chillers operating at a high PLR and rated compressor ratio to realize high DCOP values [30] . 2) The water transport factor was raised to evaluate the energy performance of chilled water systems ( WTF ch ), cooling water systems ( WTF c ), and cooling towers ( WTF ct ), as described in Eqs (5)-(7), (5) WTF ch = Q e W ch (6) WTF c = Q e W c (7) WTF ct = Q e W ct where W ch , W c , and W ct represent the electric power of chilled water pumps, cooling water pumps and cooling towers, with unit kW. Then taking a chilled water system for example, the water transport factor could be further analyzed with Eq. (8) , (8) WTF ch = Q e W ch = C ∙ G ch ∙ dT ch G ch ∙ g ∙ H ch η ch = K ch ∙ dT ch ∙ η ch H ch where C is the water heat capacity in kJ/(kg·℃), G ch is the chilled water flow rate in kg/s, dT ch is the temperature difference between supply and return chilled water in ℃, g is the gravity coefficient in m/s 2 , H ch is the head of chilled water pumps and also the pressure drop of the chilled water systems in kPa, η ch is the energy efficiency of chilled water pumps, and K ch is the constant coefficient calculated by C and g . It can be observed that the WTF ch is directly determined by Δ t ch , η ch , H ch , and the higher value of Δ T ch , η ch , and the lower value of H ch contributes to the higher value of WTF ch , which means the better energy performance of chilled water system. 3) The air distribution factor was raised to evaluate the energy performance of air systems ( ATF a ), as described in Eq. (9) , (9) ATF a = Q e W a where W a represents the electric power of fan in air handling unit (AHU), with unit kW. Then the ATF a could also be analyzed with Eq. (10) , (10) ATF a = Q e W a = G a ∙ d h G a ∙ g ∙ H a η a = dh ∙ η a g ∙ H a where G a is the air flow rate in kg/s; dh is the supply and return air enthalpy difference in kJ/kg; H a is air distribution resistance in Pa; η a is the energy efficiency of fan. It can be observed that the ATF a is directly determined by dh , η a , H a , and the higher value of dh , η a , and the lower value of H a contributes to the higher value of ATF a , which means the better energy performance of air system. During the field test, as there are too many AHUs in buildings, the dry-bulb temperature and humidity of supply and return air for each AHU are difficult to measure, and the dh is difficult to calculate. Therefore, the monitored supply and return air temperatures were collected from the local building monitoring system, and the air dry-bulb temperature difference ( dT a ) was used to reflect the relative magnitudes of dh . Furthermore, for transient values of COP , WTF ch , WTF c , WTF ct , and ATF a , the transient cooling power and electric power of chillers, chilled water pumps, cooling water pumps, cooling towers and fans were used to calculate the relevant values. For average values of energy performance indexes within a specific time period, the accumulated cooling capacity and accumulated energy consumption of relevant devices were used to calculate the relevant values. 4) Considering the pressure-bearing demand of water systems, heat exchangers are commonly applied in super high-rise buildings. To ensure the space cooling effect, the approaching temperature ( Δ T he ) of heat exchangers should be lower enough to decrease the secondary supply water temperature. As shown in Eq. (11) , the Δ T he represents the temperature difference between secondary supply water temperature ( t s , s ) and primary supply water temperature ( T p , s ), (11) Δ T he = T s , s - T p , s Then the heat transfer process of heat exchangers could be further analyzed with Eq.(12), (12) Q e = K he ∙ T s , s - T p , s - T s , r - T p , r ln T s , s - T p , s T s , r - T p , r = K he ∙ Q e G p C - Q e G s C ln Δ T he Δ T he - ( Q e G p C - Q e G s C ) Where K he is the equivalent heat transfer coefficient of heat exchangers in kW/℃; T s , s and T s , r represent the secondary supply and return water temperature in ℃; T p , s and T p , r represent the primary supply and return water temperature in ℃; G p and G s represent the primary and secondary chilled water flow rate, in kg/s. When G p and G s have the different values, set G = Q e G p C - Q e G s C , the Eq. (12) could be further calculated as Eq. (13) , (13) Δ T he = G e K he ∙ G Q e - 1 + G Then when G p equals to G s , the Eq. (12) could be further calculated as Eq. (14) , (14) Δ T he = Q e K he Obviously, increasing the K he , matching the G p and G s can decrease the Δ T he of heat exchangers, thus leading to the better space cooling effect of the whole system. Therefore, as shown in Fig. 3 , the analysis and optimization methods for water and air systems in HVACs could be classified into external factors, internal factors, and synergy control. 1) As for chillers [29] , the external factors refer to the cooling demand of the buildings and the specific operating conditions of the chilled-water and cooling-water sides. When the Q e is fixed, the higher T e and lower T c both contribute to the better energy performance of chillers. Then, the internal factors mainly refer to technical parameters or performance characteristics. For chillers, the internal factors include the adjustment performance of the compressor at different PLR and T ce . As mentioned above, the constant-speed compressor only adjusts the IGV opening to fit the variation in the PLR and compressor ratio; thus, with a decrease in the PLR and T ce , the IGV opening decreases and leads to a decrease in the compressor efficiency. So, the synergy control for chillers refers to the fact that under operation conditions with a specific Q e , the control of chillers, especially the number in operation, should be adjusted to obtain the optimal operation PLR to ensure that each chiller operates with a high DCOP . 2) As for the chilled water system, cooling water system, and air system [21] , the external factors refer to the distribution flow rate ( G ch , G c or G a ) and resistance ( H ch , H c or H a ) of the system. When the cooling power and heat exhaust are confirmed, the distribution flow rate ( G ch , G c or G a ) should be regulated to ensure that the distribution temperature differences ( dT ch , dT c or dT a ) meet the set value, avoiding the excessive water flow rate. Then the unreasonable resistance should be eliminated to decrease the H ch , H c or H a as much as possible. Additionally, the internal factors refer to the energy efficiency of water pumps and air fans. So, the synergy control for water and air systems refers to the fact that under operation conditions with a specific distribution flow rate and resistance, the operation numbers and frequency of water pumps and air fans should be adjusted to reach the relatively highest energy efficiency. 3) As for the heat exchangers, to ensure the space cooling effect, the approaching temperature ( Δ T he ) of heat exchangers should be lower enough to decrease the secondary supply water temperature. The external factors refer to the primary and secondary water flow rate ( G p and G s ), and the internal factor refers to the equivalent heat transfer coefficient ( K he ) under different G p and G s . So, the synergy control for heat exchangers refers to that during operation, the heat exchangers should be all opened to increase the heat transfer area, which contributes to the increasing of K he . Then the G p should be adjusted to ensure the lower value of Δ T he .\n\nResults\n2.3 Analysis on the annual energy performance of HVACs Based on the building management system (BMS), the annual accumulated cooling capacity and electricity consumption of HVACs for Project A (2021) and Project B (2019) were obtained and analyzed. Fig. 4 then illustrates the accumulated cooling capacity per day. The space cooling period lasts for the whole year, and the accumulated cooling capacity of Project A reached 56.15 GWh in 2021, where the accumulated cooling capacity of the ice-storage system and direct-supply chillers reached 29.75 GWh and 26.41 GWh, accounting for 53.0 % and 47.0 % respectively. Besides, the accumulated cooling capacity of Project B reached 33.57 GWh in 2019. Using space cooling areas as a comparison, which are 373000 m 2 in Project A and 142800 m 2 in Project B, the accumulated cooling capacity per area reached 150.5 kWh/m 2 in Project A and 235.1 kWh/m 2 in Project B. Fig. 5 then shows projects A and B's annual accumulated electricity consumption. The accumulated electricity consumption of HVACs in Project A reached 31.44 GWh in 2021, and the value per area reached 84.30 kWh/m 2 . Where the energy consumption of ICHs, air system and DCHs were top three, which reached 9.34 GWh, 9.25 GWh and 5.07 GWh, and accounted for 30 %, 29 %, 16 % of the total values. Besides, the energy consumption of multistage chilled water system, including ICHGPs and IGPs, reached 3.91 GWh and also accounted for a considerable portion (13 %). In addition, the accumulated electricity consumption of HVACs in Project B reached 15.62 GWh in 2019, and the value per area reached 109.4 kWh/m 2 . Where the energy consumption of CHs, air system and multistage cooling water system were top three, which reached 6.77 GWh, 5.43 GWh and 2.28 GWh, and accounted for 43 %, 35 %, and 15 % of the total values. It can be seen that the chillers and air system consume more than 70 % electricity of total values and are the fundamental objects of energy conservation. Besides, as the cooling and chilled water systems are designed multistage in super high-rise public buildings, they should also be paid more attention to energy conservation. With detailed accumulated cooling capacity and electricity consumption of HVACs, the annual energy performance of critical devices and sub-systems could be calculated and analyzed, results are shown in Table 4 . As for Project A, the yearly average COP of ICHs and DCHs reached 3.19 and 5.21, which were lower than the rated values. Besides, as the chilled water system was designed multistage, the average WTF of chilled water systems was only 26.22, which showed poor energy efficiency. In comparison, the annual average COP of CHs in Project B reached 4.96. As the cooling water system was designed multistage, the average WTF of cooling water systems was only 14.57. In addition, the average ATF of air systems in projects A and B were 6.07 and 6.18, which also need improvement. It can be seen that the high-class office rooms in super high-rise buildings need higher indoor environment quality, and the closed windows make it hard to utilize fresh air for free cooling in transition seasons. Thus, the space cooling capacity of high-rise buildings is much larger than that of conventional office buildings. Then, due to the super high-rise building structure, the cooling and chilled water systems are specially designed to be multistage, and the energy consumption of water pumps is bound to be higher. As analyzed in Table 4 , the energy performance of HVACs was not as good as expected. Then, this paper will explore the typical issues leading to higher energy consumption with methodology and indexes raised in section 2.2 , to guide the optimal design and efficient operation of HVACs in super high-rise buildings.\n\nResults\n4.1 Analysis on the operation performance of multistage chilled water systems Due to the limitation of water pressure, the multistage chilled water systems with heat exchangers are commonly installed in super high-rise office buildings. Taking Project A for example, three-stage chilled water systems were applied with a supply water temperature of primary, secondary, and tertiary sides designed to 5.7 °C, 7.0 °C, and 8.2 °C, respectively. And the designed water temperature differences are all 7.0 °C. The stability of multistage chilled water systems and the assurance supply water temperature have always been challenging targets to achieve and control. Fig. 11 shows the actual supply and return water temperatures of multistage chilled water system in Project A on 14:00 19th Aug. 2021. The data monitored on-site revealed that the supply water temperature from the primary side of chiller plant was 4.4 °C, which increased by 1.2 K to 5.6 °C after mixing through the bypass pipe with high-temperature return water from secondary side. After the heat transfer in the first stage heat exchangers, the secondary-side supply water temperature increased by 1.2 °C, reaching 6.8 °C. Then the tertiary-side supply water temperature increased by 1.9 °C, reaching 8.7 °C. Except for the slightly higher temperature on the tertiary side, the primary and secondary side supply water temperature met the designed values. The multistage chilled water system operated stably, ensuring a comfortable end-user environment. However, as mentioned in section 2.3 , the WTF of chilled water systems was only 26.22, which showed poor energy efficiency. Thus, the practical operation performance and typical issues of multistage chilled water system will be analyzed with Eq. (8) in this section from aspects of dT ch and H ch . 4.1.1 The operation performance of direct-connected chilled water system The direct-connected chilled water systems supply chilled water to AHUs directly. Taking Project A for example, Fig. 12 shows the supply and return water temperature ( dT ch ) of direct-connected chilled water systems of Zone 1 ∼ 7 and shopping mall from 13:00 to 18:30, 19th Aug. 2021. The curve graph on left side shows the variation trend of water temperature difference, and the box plots on right side show the distribution of water temperature difference. Then, Table 6 lists the operation parameters. The occupancy rates of Project A were very high, while those of Zone 4 and 7 were lower than 90 %, and Zone 1 ∼ 2 were fully occupied. To analyze the influence of setting values of differential pressure ( dP s ) on the operation performance of a direct-connected chilled water system, the dP s of Zone 1 and 2 were set to 80 and 70 kPa, while the dP s of Zone 3 ∼ 7 and the shopping mall were set to the designed value of 120 kPa. With lower dP s , only one water pump operates in Zone 1 and 2 with frequencies of 31.1 Hz and 30.2 Hz. In this condition, the average water valve opening of AHUs reached 62 % and 71 %, with the average dT ch reaching 7.2 °C and 7.4 °C, respectively. In comparison, with higher dP s , two water pumps were operating for each system of in Zone 3 ∼ 7 and the shopping mall, and with a frequency higher than 41 Hz. Besides, the average water valve opening of AHUs varied from 24 % to 51 %. At this condition, the average values of dT ch were much lower than that of Zone 1 and 2, which were only 1 °C ∼ 4 °C. Especially for Zone 6 and the shopping mall, the dT ch was lower than 2.5 °C, which was significantly less than the designed value. It indicated that the dP s significantly influence on the operation performance of direct-connected chilled water systems. However, in Zone 3 ∼ 7 and the shopping mall, the dP s were still set at designed values without adjusting with the actual cooling demand. This led to generally small water valve openings of AHUs while the water pumps operated at high frequencies. Then, the chilled water systems all operated in conditions of large flow rate and small dT ch , increasing the energy consumption. Based on the analysis, the optimization commissioning was carried out in directly connected chilled water system in Zone 5, and Fig. 13 shows the commissioning process: 1) Before commissioning, the dP s was 120 kPa, and 2 water pumps operated with F ch of 43.1 Hz, total W ch of 14.3 kW, and average valve opening of all AHUs reaching only 39 %. 2) Then, with the dP s gradually decreased to 60 kPa, the F ch of 2 water pumps decreased to 35.9 Hz, with the average valve opening of all AHUs increasing to 64 %. Besides, the total W ch decreased to 4.0 kW, reaching energy saving rate of 72.0 %. It can be seen that, for direct-connected chilled water systems, it is necessary to readjust the setting values of dP s according to the space cooling demand to avoid unnecessary energy waste due to improper control parameters under partial load conditions. With similar control and optimization methods of VAV systems and fresh air systems, when there are some water valves of AHUs fully opened, the setting value of dP s should be increased; thus, the water pumps would regulate the frequency to increase the total chilled water flow rate. Besides, once there is no water valve of AHUs fully opened, the setting value of dP s should be decreased; thus, the water pumps would regulate the frequency to lower the water flow rate. With this control method, the water valve of AHUs could open as large as possible to decrease the H ch of the system, and the F ch was adjusted in time to keep a larger and appropriate dT ch . Thus, the WTF ch of direct-connected chilled water systems could be increased for better energy performance. 4.1.2 The heat transfer performance of heat exchangers influences operation performance of multistage chilled water system significantly For a multistage chilled water system, the heat transfer performance of heat exchangers has significant influence on the secondary-side supply water temperature, and also on the primary-side supply and return water temperature difference of. Theoretically, the water valve opening in the primary side is regulated to adjust the water flow rate and make the supply water temperature in the secondary side reach the set vale. Besides, the operation frequency of primary-side water pumps is adjusted to keep the pressure difference in the primary side of heat exchangers ( dP p ) to reach the set value. However, during practical operation, the water valve opening in the primary side, the frequency of primary side water pumps were regulated manually, thus causing the poor performance of heat exchangers. As shown in Table 7 , the dT ch in the direct-connected (tertiary side) system in Zone 4 ∼ 7 was only 4.3 °C, 4.0 °C, 2.1 °C and 3.9 °C, thus the secondary side chilled water systems could only increase the supply water flow rate to ensure that the tertiary-side supply water temperature reaching the set value. Consequently, the dT ch of the secondary side in Zone 4 ∼ 7 reached only 5.1 °C, 4.1 °C, 2.4 °C and 4.8 °C. Then for the heat exchangers between the primary and secondary side, as the dT ch of secondary side in Zone 4 ∼ 7 was only 3.3 °C, thus the dT ch of primary side was only 2.6 °C, which also operated in conditions with a large flow rate and small dT ch . That is to say, once the secondary-side dT ch of heat exchangers is less than the design value due to the limited heat transfer capacity of the heat exchangers, the primary-side water flow rate should be increased to ensure that the secondary-side supply water temperature reaches the set value. In this case, the dT ch of the primary side will also be less than the design value. Then for the Zone 2, where the dT ch of secondary chilled water system reached 7.6 °C. But the insufficient heat transfer performance of heat exchangers led to an excessively large flow rate on the primary side, with a dT ch of only 4.6 °C. On the other hand, the secondary-side supply water temperature was set to 7.0 °C, but the actual temperature reached 6.6 °C, already lower than the set value. This further indicates improper control of the primary-side chilled water system of heat exchangers, resulting in an excessive supply. Therefore, for the heat exchangers in the multistage chilled water system, the heat transfer performance should be enhanced, and all the Heat exchangers should be turned on to increase the heat transfer area, thus reducing the Δ T he between the primary side and the secondary side. In the meantime, the primary-side water valve should be regulated to adjust the primary side water flow rate, ensuring that the T s,s reaches the set value. At the same time, the primary side water pumps would adjust the frequency to maintain the dP p at the set value. Hence, the heat transfer performance of the heat exchangers not only determines the operating conditions of the secondary side water system, but also affects the energy performance of the primary side water system. Poor heat transfer performance often leads to higher secondary side supply water temperatures, which then results in a larger flow rate and a smaller temperature difference of secondary side, increasing the energy consumption of water pumps. Therefore, the high heat transfer performance of heat exchangers is crucial for ensuring the stable and efficient operation of multistage chilled water systems. 4.1.3 The reverse water mixing in bypass should be avoided in primary-secondary chilled water systems Taking Project A for example, as shown in Fig. 14 , the secondary side of the central plant in this project consists of branches of the shopping mall, Zone 1, and High Zones, each of which is driven by respective secondary pumps. During the transitional seasons, when the cooling power is low, improper control of the secondary water pumps in each zone often leads to reverse water mixing in the bypass pipe between the primary and secondary chilled water systems. This results in the secondary supply water temperature being higher than the primary-side supply water temperature. As shown in Fig.14 (a), at the moment of 11:00 on 18th Nov. 2021, the reverse water flow rate reached 94 kg/s, accounting for 20.5 % of the total flow rate on the secondary side. This resulted in an evident increase in the supply water temperature on the secondary side. Particularly for Zone 1, as shown in Fig. 15 , the supply chilled water pipe is located adjacent to the bypass pipe, when the high-temperature return water from the secondary side flows into the bypass pipe, it has not mixed uniformly with the primary side supply water and is drawn into the Zone 1 supply pipelines, leading to a high supply water temperature of 8.7 °C for Zone 1. In contrast, the supply pipes for the shopping mall and High Zones are located more than 20 m away from the bypass pipe, allowing for thorough mixing between the secondary side return water and the primary side supply water. Thus, the supply water temperature of the shopping mall and high zones reached 6.3 °C, which was 2.4 °C lower than that for Zone 1. On the other hand, the actual supply and return chilled water temperature differences ( dT ch ) of Zone 1, High Zone and Shopping mall branches were only 4.0 °C, 3.0 °C and 1.7 °C, which were all significantly lower than the designed value (7 °C). However, at this time, there were still one water pump operating with the frequency of 36.0 Hz in Zone 1, 3 water pumps operating with the frequency of 30.0 Hz in High Zone, and two water pumps operating with the frequency of 25.0 Hz in shopping mall. Therefore, the water flow rate of 3 branches could be decreased to increase the dT ch , and also to reduce the energy consumption of water pumps. To address the issues, the operation state of secondary chilled water pumps was adjusted, and adjustment results are depicted in Fig. 16 . Firstly, the 3 chilled water pumps with the frequency of 30.0 Hz were adjusted to 2 chilled water pumps with the frequency of 30.0 Hz in High Zones. Then the 2 water pumps with frequency of 25.0 Hz in shopping mall were adjusted to 1 water pump with frequency of 25.0 Hz. Subsequently, the pressure differential setting value in Zone 1 was reduced from 150 kPa to 130 kPa. While the water pump frequency decreased from 36.0 Hz to 33.0 Hz. After the adjustment, the return water temperature of High-zones increased from 9.3 °C to 9.8 °C. The primary-side water valve opening of heat exchangers increased from 24 % to 78 % in Zone 2, increased from 22 % to 47 % in Zone 3, and increased from 19 % to 81 % in Zone 4 ∼ 7. Then the return water temperature of shopping mall increased from 9.1 °C to 10.2 °C. Besides, the average water valve opening of AHUs in Zone 1 increased from 46 % to 51 %. As a result, the reverse water flow rate in bypass pipe decreased from the previous 94 kg/s to 10 kg/s. At this point, even the primary-side supply water temperature increased from 5.6 °C to 6.4 °C, the supply water temperature in Zone 1decreased from 8.7 °C to 6.9 °C. Simultaneously, the total power consumption of the secondary water pumps decreased from 68.6 kW to 47.6 kW, resulting in energy savings of 30.6 %. Therefore, during practical operation, it is necessary to avoid large flow rate and low water temperature differences of secondary side caused by proper control strategy. Thus, the primary-side water flow rate should also be adjusted to avoid the reverse water mixing in bypass. This not only ensures or optimizes the cooling effect of terminals, but also reduces the energy consumption of the secondary-side water pumps. On the other hand, after eliminating the temperature rise caused by reverse mixing, the primary-side supply water temperature could be effectively increased, which could directly improve the energy performance of chillers.\n\nResults\n4.1.1 The operation performance of direct-connected chilled water system The direct-connected chilled water systems supply chilled water to AHUs directly. Taking Project A for example, Fig. 12 shows the supply and return water temperature ( dT ch ) of direct-connected chilled water systems of Zone 1 ∼ 7 and shopping mall from 13:00 to 18:30, 19th Aug. 2021. The curve graph on left side shows the variation trend of water temperature difference, and the box plots on right side show the distribution of water temperature difference. Then, Table 6 lists the operation parameters. The occupancy rates of Project A were very high, while those of Zone 4 and 7 were lower than 90 %, and Zone 1 ∼ 2 were fully occupied. To analyze the influence of setting values of differential pressure ( dP s ) on the operation performance of a direct-connected chilled water system, the dP s of Zone 1 and 2 were set to 80 and 70 kPa, while the dP s of Zone 3 ∼ 7 and the shopping mall were set to the designed value of 120 kPa. With lower dP s , only one water pump operates in Zone 1 and 2 with frequencies of 31.1 Hz and 30.2 Hz. In this condition, the average water valve opening of AHUs reached 62 % and 71 %, with the average dT ch reaching 7.2 °C and 7.4 °C, respectively. In comparison, with higher dP s , two water pumps were operating for each system of in Zone 3 ∼ 7 and the shopping mall, and with a frequency higher than 41 Hz. Besides, the average water valve opening of AHUs varied from 24 % to 51 %. At this condition, the average values of dT ch were much lower than that of Zone 1 and 2, which were only 1 °C ∼ 4 °C. Especially for Zone 6 and the shopping mall, the dT ch was lower than 2.5 °C, which was significantly less than the designed value. It indicated that the dP s significantly influence on the operation performance of direct-connected chilled water systems. However, in Zone 3 ∼ 7 and the shopping mall, the dP s were still set at designed values without adjusting with the actual cooling demand. This led to generally small water valve openings of AHUs while the water pumps operated at high frequencies. Then, the chilled water systems all operated in conditions of large flow rate and small dT ch , increasing the energy consumption. Based on the analysis, the optimization commissioning was carried out in directly connected chilled water system in Zone 5, and Fig. 13 shows the commissioning process: 1) Before commissioning, the dP s was 120 kPa, and 2 water pumps operated with F ch of 43.1 Hz, total W ch of 14.3 kW, and average valve opening of all AHUs reaching only 39 %. 2) Then, with the dP s gradually decreased to 60 kPa, the F ch of 2 water pumps decreased to 35.9 Hz, with the average valve opening of all AHUs increasing to 64 %.

With similar control and optimization methods of VAV systems and fresh air systems, when there are some water valves of AHUs fully opened, the setting value of dP s should be increased; thus, the water pumps would regulate the frequency to increase the total chilled water flow rate. Besides, once there is no water valve of AHUs fully opened, the setting value of dP s should be decreased; thus, the water pumps would regulate the frequency to lower the water flow rate. With this control method, the water valve of AHUs could open as large as possible to decrease the H ch of the system, and the F ch was adjusted in time to keep a larger and appropriate dT ch . Thus, the WTF ch of direct-connected chilled water systems could be increased for better energy performance.\n\nResults\n4.1.2 The heat transfer performance of heat exchangers influences operation performance of multistage chilled water system significantly For a multistage chilled water system, the heat transfer performance of heat exchangers has significant influence on the secondary-side supply water temperature, and also on the primary-side supply and return water temperature difference of. Theoretically, the water valve opening in the primary side is regulated to adjust the water flow rate and make the supply water temperature in the secondary side reach the set vale.

However, during practical operation, the water valve opening in the primary side, the frequency of primary side water pumps were regulated manually, thus causing the poor performance of heat exchangers. As shown in Table 7 , the dT ch in the direct-connected (tertiary side) system in Zone 4 ∼ 7 was only 4.3 °C, 4.0 °C, 2.1 °C and 3.9 °C, thus the secondary side chilled water systems could only increase the supply water flow rate to ensure that the tertiary-side supply water temperature reaching the set value. Consequently, the dT ch of the secondary side in Zone 4 ∼ 7 reached only 5.1 °C, 4.1 °C, 2.4 °C and 4.8 °C. Then for the heat exchangers between the primary and secondary side, as the dT ch of secondary side in Zone 4 ∼ 7 was only 3.3 °C, thus the dT ch of primary side was only 2.6 °C, which also operated in conditions with a large flow rate and small dT ch . That is to say, once the secondary-side dT ch of heat exchangers is less than the design value due to the limited heat transfer capacity of the heat exchangers, the primary-side water flow rate should be increased to ensure that the secondary-side supply water temperature reaches the set value.

But the insufficient heat transfer performance of heat exchangers led to an excessively large flow rate on the primary side, with a dT ch of only 4.6 °C. On the other hand, the secondary-side supply water temperature was set to 7.0 °C, but the actual temperature reached 6.6 °C, already lower than the set value.

At the same time, the primary side water pumps would adjust the frequency to maintain the dP p at the set value. Hence, the heat transfer performance of the heat exchangers not only determines the operating conditions of the secondary side water system, but also affects the energy performance of the primary side water system. Poor heat transfer performance often leads to higher secondary side supply water temperatures, which then results in a larger flow rate and a smaller temperature difference of secondary side, increasing the energy consumption of water pumps. Therefore, the high heat transfer performance of heat exchangers is crucial for ensuring the stable and efficient operation of multistage chilled water systems.\n\nResults\n4.2 Analysis on the operation performance of multistage cooling water system As the cooling towers are installed on the rooftop, the multistage cooling water systems are applied in Project B. As shown in Fig. 17 , the practical cooling water temperatures of multistage cooling water systems on 10:00, 17th Sept. 2021 were measured and presented. Under actual operating conditions, the wet bulb temperature of the atmosphere was 26.2 °C. At this point, the cooling tower’s outlet water temperature reached 28.8 °C, resulting in an approach temperature of 2.6 °C. After the first-stage heat exchangers, the secondary-side supply water temperature reached 30.0 °C, with an approach temperature ( Δ T he ) of 1.2 °C. Following the second-stage heat exchangers, the supply water temperature on the condensing side, which was the inlet temperature of chiller's condenser, reached 30.8 °C, with Δ T he of 0.8 °C for the second-stage heat exchangers. It can be seen that the cooling water temperature rose 4.6 °C from the outdoor wet bulb temperature to the condensers’ inlet water temperature. Then, the cooling tower achieved a heat transfer efficiency of 63.4 %, while the two-stage heat exchangers achieved heat transfer efficiencies of 79.3 % and 86.9 %, respectively. Thus, the overall heat transfer efficiency on the cooling water side reached 53.5 %, which was significantly lower than the conventional cooling water systems. The multistage cooling water systems also have larger energy consumption of water pumps. As shown in Table 2 , the energy consumption of cooling water system, including all CWPs, PCWPs, SCWPs and CTs, reached 276.92 GWh in 2019, thus the energy efficiency of cooling water system was only 14.57, which was also lower than conventional cooling water system. Consequently, the performance of key equipment in the cooling water system not only affects the energy consumption of the cooling water system but also has a significant impact on the cooling water temperature, which in turn affects the operational performance of the chillers. Therefore, in actual operation, it is necessary to improve the heat transfer performance of cooling towers and heat exchangers, as well as the energy efficiency of water pumps, which ensures efficient heat transfer and reduces the energy consumption of the cooling water system.\n\nResults\n4.3 Analysis on the operation performance of chillers Taking Project B for example, the energy performance of chillers is analyzed in this section. As mentioned above, the transient cooling power and electric power of chillers were used to calculate the relevant values for the transient value of COP . For average values of COP within a specific time period, the accumulated cooling capacity and accumulated energy consumption of chillers were used to calculate the relevant values. Based on the measured data, the average COP of the chillers per month was calculated, as illustrated in Fig.18 . The orange line shows the variation of average wet bulb temperature per month. The center of the blue circle shows the average COP of the chillers per month, while the area of the blue circle shows the accumulated cooling capacity per month. It can be observed that the average COP differs for different months. In the cooling season from May to October, which is characterized by high building cooling demands and high ambient temperatures, the chillers operated with low chilled-water temperatures and high cooling-water temperatures; thus, the average COP of the chillers remained relatively low (approximately 4.20 to 5.30). In the transition season from November to April of the following year, owing to the lower cooling demand and ambient temperatures, the chillers operated with higher chilled-water temperatures and lower cooling-water temperatures; thus, the average COP of the chillers rose to about 5.30 to 6.10. Fig.19 then compares the annual average COP distributions of each chiller in 2019. Among the 4 constant-speed centrifugal chillers with rated cooling power of 6331 kW, the 2# chiller had the poorest performance with an average COP of 4.60, while1# and 4# chillers had better performance with an average COP of 5.70. Then for 5# chiller with rated cooling power of 3623 kW, the annual average COP reached only 4.70. And for 6#, 7# chillers with rated cooling power of 1864 kW, the annual average COP reached 5.50 and 5.80 respectively. Then for 2#, 3#, 5# chillers with poor energy performance, and 6# chiller, Fig. 20 shows the distribution of transient COP across the entire cooling in 2019 with time intervals of 10 min. The abscissa shows the transient value of PLR , and the ordinate shows the transient value of T ce of chillers. As T ce represents the condensing and evaporating temperature difference, then T ce decreases with the decreasing of cooling water temperature and increasing of chilled water temperature. The scatter points in the diagram represent operational data of transient COP for the duration of the cooling season, taken in 10-minutes intervals. Besides, the blue histogram shows the frequency distribution of PLR and T ce . It can be seen that the COP of 4 chillers has the same variation tendency, that the COP increases with the increase of PLR and the decrease of T ce . The influencing rules could be explained with Eqs. (1) ∼(4). With the decreasing of T ce , which means the increasing of chilled water temperatures and decreasing of cooling water temperatures, the values of ICOP increases obviously. But the DCOP is also influenced by PLR and T ce . Fig. 21 then shows the transient DCOP distribution of 2#, 3#, 5# and 6# chillers across the entire cooling in 2019. As the constant-speed compressor only adjusts the IGV opening to fit the variation in the PLR and compressor ratio. Thus, with a decrease in the PLR and T ce , the IGV opening decreases, which leads to a reduction in the compressor efficiency. Thus, the DCOP decreases with the decreasing of PLR and T ce . Comparing 2# and 3# chillers with the same rated performance. They both operated with relatively high PLR from 0.65 to 0.9, but the 3# chiller had higher T ce , thus contributing to that 3# chiller had higher DCOP, which then contributed to the higher value of COP . Besides, as 5# and 6# chillers have smaller rated cooling power, they often operate at night or at transition season. When the cooling water temperature was significantly lower than designed values, thus 5# and 6# chillers have much lower operated T ce than those of 2# and 3# chillers. At the same time, with lower cooling demand and improper control strategies, the 5# and 6# chillers operated with smaller PLR , which concentrated lower than 0.60. Then with smaller PLR and T ce , the DCOP of 5# and 6# chillers was lower than those of 2# and 3# chillers. Fig.22 further shows the difference in operation performance among different chillers. The abscissa shows the total cooling power, and the ordinate displays the PLR of the chillers. The scatter points represent operational data recorded at 10-minute intervals. The color scale represents the different chiller combinations, where “mB + nM + oS” indicates that m big-capacity chillers, n medium-capacity chillers, and o small-capacity chillers operate simultaneously. The vertical bars represent the rated cooling power of corresponding chiller combinations. Theoretically, a particular chiller combination will correspond to a specific cooling power range. However, it can be observed that the current chiller operation strategy is chaotic in that different chiller combinations supply the same cooling capacity. For example, to achieve a cooling power of 6000 kW, there are 5 possible chiller combinations. However, only one of these combinations operates with the most suitable PLR and highest COP , whereas the other five chiller combinations operate with lower COP and result in wasted energy. Table 8 presents the rated cooling powers of different chiller combinations and the lower limits of the PLR . Once the current chiller combination operates with PLR below the lower limit, a chiller combination with lower rated cooling power should be selected and adjusted. However, as shown in Fig. 26, numerous chiller combinations operated with PLR below the lower limit. Fig.23 shows the transient COP of chillers in different combinations. The abscissa shows the total cooling power, and the ordinate displays the transient COP of the chillers. The scatter points represent operational data recorded at 10 min intervals, and the color scale represents the different chiller combinations. The results show that for the same operational cooling power, the chiller combinations with higher rated cooling power operated with a lower PLR and a reasonably lower COP . This indicates that the control strategy of the chiller combinations is not suitable for adjusting the chiller combinations over time, thus leading to a low PLR and low COP . In particular, for constant-speed centrifugal chillers, a higher PLR could lead to a higher COP . Therefore, control strategies should be further optimized to improve the energy performance of the chillers.\n\nConclusion\n5 Conclusions This paper conducted field tests and a comparative study on the HVACs from the air system to chiller plant of two super high-rise office buildings. Where typical problems were summarized and studied. Through the research and analysis, the following recommendations are made for optimizing the energy performance of HVACs in super high-rise public buildings: 1) The larger supply and return air temperature difference ( dT a ), smaller air distribution resistance ( H a ), and higher energy efficiency of fans could contribute to the better energy performance of VAV systems. Thus, during practical operation, the static pressure ( P a ) of AHUs should be adjusted in time according to the space cooling demand. So as to avoid the operation conditions of large air flow rate, smaller dT a and larger H a , which will cause the energy waste of VAV system and overcooling environment. hen optimization was conducted on the control strategies of 15 VAV systems, and the average energy-saving rate reached 53.8 %. 2) Due to the limitation of water pressure, multistage chilled water systems are commonly installed in super high-rise office buildings. This would not only affect the energy consumption of the water pumps, but also significantly impact on the operation temperature. The larger supply and return water temperature difference ( dT ch ), smaller water distribution resistance ( H ch ), and higher energy efficiency of water pumps could contribute to the better energy performance of multistage chilled water systems. Therefore, it is necessary to apply suitable control strategy for the terminal direct-connected system to avoid over-supplying. Then, the heat transfer performance of heat exchangers should be enhanced to ensure the secondary supply water temperature reaches setting values and also to prevent the larger water flow rate of the primary side. The optimization was conducted on the control strategies of the direct-connected chilled water system, and the energy saving rate reached 72.0 %. 3) As for the primary-secondary chilled water system in chiller plant, it is necessary to avoid large flow rate and low water temperature differences of secondary side caused by proper control strategy. And the primary-side water flow rate should also be adjusted to avoid the reverse water mixing in bypass. This not only ensures or optimizes the cooling effect of terminals, but also reduces the energy consumption of the secondary-side water pumps. Then optimization was conducted on the control strategies of primary-secondary chilled water system, and the energy saving rate reached 30.6 %. 4) Due to the imitation of water pressure, multistage cooling water systems are commonly installed in super high-rise office buildings. To ensure the heat removal effect, the heat transfer performance of cooling towers and heat exchangers should be enhanced to ensure the lower cooling water temperature for chillers. 5) The energy performance of chillers is significantly influenced by the PLR and T ce . For different types of chillers, the optimal operation values of PLR and T ce are different. Thus the control of chillers, especially the number in operation, should be adjusted to obtain the optimal operation PLR to ensure that each chiller operates with a high energy performance.\n"
