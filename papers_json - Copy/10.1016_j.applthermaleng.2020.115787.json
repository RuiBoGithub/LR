This paper presents a model-free control and automatic staging strategy for the operation of a variable refrigerant flow system with multiple outdoor units, which maximizes energy efficiency in real time and handles the outdoor-unit operation during load changes. An extremum seeking controller is used to minimize the total power consumption in real time while the thermal load is regulated with inner loop controllers. Minimization of power with extremum seeking control leads naturally to manipulated input behavior that can be utilized to develop control logic for two aspects of multi-outdoor-unit operation in model-free manner: (1) automatically stage off the outdoor unit with least efficient compressor, and (2) automatically switch the operation of outdoor-unit heat exchanger between the evaporating and condensing mode for simultaneous heating and cooling. As the extremum seeking controller can drive the least-efficient compressor to a lower capacity, the outdoor unit with the least efficient compressor can thus be identified and turned off in a model-free manner under a decreasing load. Under simultaneous heating and cooling operation, the fan speed of the least efficient outdoor-unit heat exchanger will be lower than all other outdoor units, which indicates that the heat exchanger can be switched between operation as a condenser and evaporator to achieve thermal balance for higher efficiency. The proposed strategy is evaluated using a Modelica model of a variable-refrigerant-flow system that consists of three outdoor units and 12 indoor units. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated with the simulation study.

In VRF systems, variable-capacity compressors, in combination with electronic expansion valves (EEVs), are used to direct the refrigerant flow to the evaporators of the IDUs, and the capacities of individual IDUs can thus be modulated. Compared to ducted HVAC systems, VRF systems have several merits, for instance reduction space requirement and power loss without the need for air ducts, flexibility in terms of design, installation and operation, lower operational noise for occupancy, among others [2]. Due to these advantages, significant penetration of VRF systems to the cooling and heating of commercial and residential buildings has become a major trend for the building industry. For shoulder seasons (i.e. ambient temperature between 45°F and 65°F), VRF systems with heat recovery, also known as the Multi-functional VRF (MFVRF) systems, can achieve simultaneous heating and cooling for different zones and thus yield remarkable improvement in energy efficiency. With different ON/OFF combinations of control valves, the IDU and ODU coils can switch their operation modes between evaporator and condenser based on the characteristics of thermal loads [9]. There has been a great deal of research on developing control strategies for single-ODU VRF systems, with the objectives of improving energy efficiency and indoor air quality (IAQ). Weiss et al. [24] presented a hybrid strategy of VRF system control, in which the outer-loop control is extremum seeking control (ESC), and the inner loop is a model predictive control (MPC) based regulation. Zhu et al. [23] studied a control strategy for VRF operation combined with a dedicated outdoor air system (DOAS). The simulation results showed that the zonal temperature and IAQ indices were both well regulated, and the DOAS supply temperature demonstrated significant impact on the energy efficiency for overall system operation. Jiang et al. [10,11], considered the controls for a VRF system combined with a desiccant heat pump, in which the sensible and latent loads can be handled independently. The proposed system was shown to provide better IAQ, higher coefficient of performance (COP) and energy saving compared with the benchmarked joint heat-recovery ventilator and VRF system. For a combined VRF-VAV system that addresses the need of outdoor air ventilation for VRF system operation, Zhu et al. [22] optimized the energy consumption and thermal comfort with a genetic algorithm (GA). Kim et al. [13] proposed multi-objective optimal control strategy for a multi-zone VRF- DOAS system by using GA and a response surface method. The objectives include maintaining the thermal comfort and IAQ as well as optimizing energy consumption. Compared with a time-schedule strategy and a demand-controlled ventilation scheme, the simulation results with the proposed strategy showed lower energy consumption and improved thermal comfort regulation. Yun et al. [21] presented a load responsive control for the evaporating control to reduce the cooling energy consumption of a VRF system. Furthermore, Yun et al. [20] proposed a load responsive discharge pressure control to reduce energy consumption of the VRF system during heating operation at part load conditions. The experimental results showed a reduction in the heating energy consumption for building operation during the winter season (i.e. January, February, March, November and December). Yan et al. [19] presented a capacity controller for thermal comfort regulation of a multi-evaporator air conditioning system, which controls both zone temperature and relative humidity. Kang et al. [12] developed a control algorithm for setpoint optimization for cooling operation of a VRF system, in which an artificial neural network model was designed to predict the cooling energy consumption for the ensuing control cycle. The prediction model for control design showed acceptable accuracy, and significant energy saving was shown for the VRF system cooling operation. Kim et al. [14] proposed a control algorithm for thermal comfort regulation and energy savings for VRF systems in residential buildings. The algorithm was based on the detection of occupancy from environmental data. The experimental case study of the proposed control algorithm showed improvement of thermal comfort regulation and energy savings over the conventional control method. The control of VRF systems is quite challenging due to significant process nonlinearities and large variations in ambient and load conditions. These challenges increase the cost of deployment for real-time control and optimization strategies. The challenge is further exacerbated for MFVRF systems due to the them having multiple operational modes. Therefore, model-free approaches are attractive and have received considerable attention. Recently, the authors have proposed a multi-input extremum seeking control (ESC) based strategy for a VRF system with four IDUs and one ODU[5]. The IDU zone temperature is regulated by the EEV opening, and the compressor pressure is regulated by the compressor speed. The feedback signal for ESC is the total power consumption of the system, and the manipulated inputs are the compressor pressure setpoints, ODU fan mass flow rate and superheat (SH) setpoints for individual IDUs. Using a Modelica-based dynamic model, simulations performed under different operating modes revealed that ESC can converge to the optimum found by an offline simulation-based optimization procedure. In addition, we have developed an automatic mode switching strategy for switching the ODU operation between evaporator and condenser for time-varying load conditions based on the use of a normalized ODU temperature gradient [6]. Larger VRF systems commonly use multiple ODUs. For a VRF system with multiple ODUs, Tu et al. [16] proposed a heating control strategy that includes compressor speed adjustment, switching conditions for operating compressor in different ODUs and a frequency allocation model. The system configuration features one compressor in each ODU. Later, for a VRF based air conditioning system with multiple compressors (one variable-speed and one constant-speed), Tu et al. [17] developed a model-based control strategy to determine the compressor staging and regulation for efficiency improvement and noise suppression. The control strategy involves both smooth and stable staging of the constant-speed compressor and modulation of the variable-speed compressor, based on the capacity and efficiency characteristics of both compressors. The compressor capacity was regulated by the suction pressure. The experimental results showed that the efficiency was higher for the middle frequency band, but lower for both high and low frequency bands. The focus of this paper is on VRF systems with multiple ODUs. Similar to single-ODU VRF systems, energy efficiency remains the core issue for operating multi-ODU VRF systems. Besides the search for optimum settings of manipulated inputs, efficient operation of multi-ODU VRF systems needs to address additional control challenges, including: 1) reasonable load sharing among operating ODUs, 2) proper control logic for turning on and off the compressor of individual ODUs, and 3) for heat recovery operation, automatic switching between the operation modes for the heat exchangers (evaporating or condensing) of individual ODUs for different patterns of heating and cooling loads in order to maintain optimal efficiency. In other words, the operational status (on or off), the capacity, and the heat exchanger mode of individual ODUs should be determined optimally for any combination of ambient condition and load pattern. If the characteristics of the ODUs and IDUs are known and all the operational variables can be measured, these control problems can be handled by applying readily available model-based control/optimization algorithms. However, the cost of model construction and calibration can be prohibitive. For multi-ODU VRF systems, such cost can be even higher due to larger number of ODUs and IDUs involved as well as their interactions. Therefore, for VRF systems with multiple ODUs, it is desirable to use model-free control algorithms for achieving the aforementioned objectives. The authors recently proposed an integrated model-free control and automatic staging of VRF system with multiple ODUs[7] in which the control and automatic staging is developed to maximize the energy efficiency in real time, and ODU operation and switching is handled during load changes. This paper presents a comprehensive model-free control framework for a multi-ODU VRF system, in the context of optimizing the overall system efficiency. The aforementioned research challenges are addressed from the following perspectives: 1) For a given (nearly static) operating condition, a penalty-function based constrained multivariable ESC strategy is applied, which optimizes the overall efficiency while accounting for the state and input constraints imposed on system operation. 2) Model-free automatic staging of the ODUs for turning on/off an ODU in the cooling-dominant or heating-dominant operation modes based on readily available measurements for typical VRF systems. 3) Model-free automatic switching of the operation modes of individual ODU heat exchangers during the transition between cooling-dominant and heating-dominant operation. The proposed strategy is evaluated with a dynamic simulation model for a multi-ODU VRF system consisting of 12 IDUs and three ODUs. The model is developed in Modelica using Dymola and the TIL Library [18]. The ESC strategy for energy efficient operation optimizes the manipulated input setting for scenarios of constant load level, while the control logic for ODU staging and ODU-HX mode switching is evaluated during load changes. The system modeling will be described in the next section, followed by the description for the proposed control strategies. Then, the simulation results are presented. The last section concludes the paper with discussion of future work. 2 Configuration and modeling for multi-ODU VRF system A typical multi-ODU VRF system consists of N (N ≥ 2) ODUs, M (M ≥ 2) IDUs and one mode change unit (MCU) which is also known as the \u2018changeover box\u2019, as shown in Fig. 1 . In the study, N = 3 and M = 12. The i -th (i = 1, \u2026, N) ODU includes a variable speed compressor, a heat exchanger that can be operated as either an evaporator or a condenser, and an EEV (EEVO i ) which can be used to regulate the superheat if the heat exchanger is operated as an evaporator. Two sets of bypass valves (BPV) are installed, {BPV CD ,1, \u2026, BPV CD,N } and {BPV CS, 1, \u2026, BPV CS,N\u2013 1}, near the discharge and suction ports of compressors, respectively. For IDU j (j = 1, \u2026, M), the zonal temperature is regulated by the opening of its EEV via a proportional-integral (PI) controller. For each ODU, the compressor speed is used to regulate the compressor suction pressure via a PI controller if the ODU is operated in the cooling-dominant mode. In heating dominant mode, the compressor discharge pressure is regulated place of the suction pressure. The pressure setpoints of all compressors are identical. The mode of heat exchanger operation, whether evaporating or condensing, will remain to be determined, as described later. For a generic setting, the compressors of different ODUs have different capacities and efficiencies, which leads to the necessity for optimal load sharing among multiple ODUs. In order to optimize load sharing for multi-ODU operation, a set of bypass valves are introduced in this study at the suction side of the compressors in order to control the refrigerant flow distribution among different ODU compressors. To assess the performance the proposed control framework, a Modelica based dynamic simulation model is built for an illustrative VRF system, using Dymola 2014 [3], TIL Library 3.4 [18] and TIL Media Library 3.4 [18]. In this study, the compressor is modeled with the isentropic efficiency as function of the refrigerant mass flow rate. The efficiency-based compressor model adopted from TIL Library is based on volumetric efficiency λeff , effective isentropic efficiency ηeff,is , and isentropic efficiency η is . Given the displacement volume V and compressor speed Ω, the compressor shaft power is calculated with (1) P shaft = λ eff η is × η eff , i s × ρ CD × Ω × D × ( h CD - h CS ) where ρ is the refrigerant density as a function of pressure and temperature, D is the compressor displacement, and h is the specific enthalpy of refrigerant. Subscripts \u2018CD\u2019, \u2018CS\u2019, \u2018is\u2019 and \u2018eff\u2019 denote the discharge side, the suction side, the isentropic process and the effective value, respectively. In practical operation of heat pump compressors, the efficiency often varies with the mass flow rate of refrigerant. In this study, the isentropic efficiency of a compressor is modeled as a 4th-order polynomial of the inlet-port refrigerant mass flow rate m ̇ R : (2) η is ( m ̇ R ) = c 4 m ̇ R 4 + c 3 m ̇ R 3 + c 2 m ̇ R 2 + c 1 m ̇ R + c 0 where ci (i = 0, 1, \u2026, 4) are coefficients. To avoid the measurement of biphasic refrigerant flow rate, the refrigerant mass flow rate can be measured at the compressor discharge line where the refrigerant is always in the gas phase. The measurement can be performed with an ultrasonic flow meter in practice. In the simulation study, the measurement is performed with the mass flow rate sensor. For the three ODU compressors, without loss of generality, the isentropic efficiency maps in terms of the refrigerant mass flow rate are assumed to follow the patterns as shown in Fig. 2 , i.e. Compressor #2, Compressor #1 and Compressor #3 have descending peak efficiencies. Also, note that the refrigerant mass flow rate for optimum efficiency is different. The shaft power of a compressor can then be calculated by replacing the constant isentropic efficiency in Eq. (1) with the variable mass flow rate dependent isentropic efficiency in Eq. (2). For the models of three compressors, the coefficients are summarized in Table 1 . The heat exchangers of the IDUs and ODUs are modeled with fin-and-tube parallel flow heat exchangers, using the HeatExchangers.FinAndTube.MoistAirVLEFluid.ParallelFlowHX module in the TIL Library. The pipes are all copper and the refrigerant used is R410A, for which the medium properties are computed via the TIL Media Library. Geometric parameters for the ODU and IDU HXs are summarized in the Appendix. The EEVs are modeled with the orifice valve module VLEFluidComponents.Valves.OrificeValve in the TIL Library. For each EEV in the IDUs, the upper limit of the opening is set as 2 × 10 - 3 m 2 . The BPV is modeled with the module of VLEFluidComponents.Valves.LinearDirectionalControlValve, the solenoid valves are modeled based on this module as well. The GasComponents.Volumes.Volume module in the TIL Library is used to model the zones. The ODU fan model is derived from GasComponents.Fans.SimpleFan module in the TIL Library, which follows the affinity laws correlating the volumetric flow rate, pressure increase and rotational speed as (3) m ̇ A = m ̇ A , 0 × ω fan ω fan , 0 (4) Δ P = Δ P 0 × ω fan ω fan , 0 2 where ω fan , 0 is the nominal speed, ω fan is the rotational speed, m ̇ A is the air mass flow rate, and m ̇ A , 0 is the nominal air mass flow rate. In Eq. (4), ΔP denotes the pressure increase following the fan affinity law, and Δ P 0 is the nominal pressure increase. To optimize the load distribution among multiple ODUs and to enable operation with the ODU heat exchangers in the most efficient operational combination, a set of (N\u20131) bypass valves (BPVs) (i.e. BPV CS,i for i = 1, \u2026, N\u20131) are added at the suction side of the compressors to manage refrigerant flow among different compressors. One major concern associated with adding the BPVs is the additional pressure loss that might be introduced in comparison to the original three-way junction used for a typical VRF system, and as a consequence, the additional power consumption. The pressure loss is evaluated with an illustrative scenario of a two-ODU VRF system. In this case, a single BPV (i.e. BPV CS ,1) is placed at the suction side of the two compressors. Steady-state simulations are performed with the Modelica model of the two-ODU VRF system. The opening of BPV CS ,1 varies from 10% to 90% in increments of 10%, and the suction pressure of both compressors is regulated at 11 bar with the respective compressor speed. The upper limit of the compressor speed is set at 80 Hz for both compressors. Table 2 summarizes the results of this comparison. Ω i is the compressor speed for ODU-i, P S is the suction-port pressure of the BPV CS ,1, while P D , 1 and P D , 2 denote the discharge-port pressure of the BPV CS ,1 at the suction sides of ODU-1 compressor and ODU-2 compressor, respectively. Δ P i is the pressure difference between the suction port and discharge port of the BPV CS , 1. For the BPV CS , 1 opening set at 10% (which implies that the opening to the ODU-2 compressor is 10%), the suction-side pressure of ODU-2 compressor cannot be regulated at the setpoint since the ODU-2 compressor speed is saturated at the upper limit. For the valve opening set at 80% and 90%, the suction-side pressure of ODU-1 cannot be regulated at the setpoint since the ODU-1 compressor speed is saturated at the upper limit. This indicates that the opening of suction-side BPV should stay within the intermediate range for proper operation. For the BPV opening within 20% to 70%, the pressure losses ( Δ P 1 and Δ P 2 ) across the BPV are only 1% ~ 4% of the suction-side pressure of the BPV, and the suction-side pressures of both compressors (i.e. the two discharge pressures of the BPV, PD ,1 and PD ,2 in the table) are well regulated to the setpoint. Therefore, the operation of the load-sharing valve array is acceptable for BPV CS , i openings ranging from 20 to 70%. 3 ESC integrated ODU staging strategy for multi-ODU VRF system This section presents the proposed control strategy, which includes three relevant portions, i.e. 1) a constrained ESC-based model-free real-time efficiency optimization for the multi-ODU VRF systems, 2) model-free ODU staging-on and staging-off control logic, and 3) model-free ODU heat exchanger mode switching. The ESC control under static (or pseudo-static) operation conditions yields optimum settings for the relevant manipulated variables, and its results are used to drive the staging and/or mode switching actions. After introducing the principle and design guidelines for constrained multi-variable ESC, the ESC design for the multi-ODU VRF system is presented. Then, the staging control logic will be described. Finally, the mode switching logic for ODU heat exchangers is given. 3.1 Penalty-function based constrained multivariable extremum seeking control ESC is a class of real-time setpoint optimization algorithms that are designed to seek the input uopt (t) that can optimize for the unknown and possibly slowly varying cost function l(t, u). u(t) ∈ℝ m is the vector of input parameters [1]. The standard dither ESC is realized by online gradient estimation enabled by periodic perturbation/dither and demodulation signals along with proper filtering. Fig. 3 shows the schematic of ESC, where the cost function l ( t , u ) is the system output. FI (s) denotes the linear time-invariant approximations of the input dynamics. Σ ( t ) = a 1 sin ω 1 t ⋯ a m sin ω m t T and Δ ( t ) = sin ω 1 t + α 1 ⋯ sin ω m t + α m T denote the dither and demodulation inputs, respectively, where ωi are the dithering frequencies for each input parameter channel, ai are the dither amplitudes, and αi are the phase angles introduced intentionally between the dither and demodulation signals. Under small-amplitude dither, the gradient information is carried in the first-harmonic of the dithered output. After filtering the dithered output by band-pass filters FBPi (s), the resultant signals are multiplied (demodulated) by the demodulation signals, thus shifting the gradient terms to the constant term. Applying low-pass filters FLPi (s) to the demodulated signal vector will produce a signal vector at the input of the integrator array whose element values are proportional to the gradients of the cost function. In this study, the ESC design is based on the guidelines provided in Ghaffari et al. [8]. Many process control systems are subject to input and state constraints. Successful operation of ESC needs to handle such constraints. Recently, the authors have investigated several forms of constrained ESC by formulating penalized cost-functions [4] via augmentation of the cost function with penalty terms reflecting constraint reinforcement. As shown in Fig. 3, for constrained ESC, the augmented cost function Jaug (·) can be formulated by introducing the relevant penalty terms to the measurement of cost function l(t, u). g(t, x, u) denotes penalty functions associated with the input and/or state constraints, and f(·,·) denotes some function that combines the cost function and the penalty function. Polynomial, logarithmic and absolute-value functions are typical choices for penalty functions. For the ESC designed for energy efficient operation of the multi-ODU VRF system in this study, the manipulated inputs include the identical compressor pressure setpoints for all operating compressor(s), the identical ODU fan speeds for all operating fan(s), and the openings of suction-side BPVs. For operation with three ODUs, ESC has a total of four manipulated inputs, i.e. the compressor pressure setpoint, the uniform ODU fan speed and two BPV openings. The performance index for ESC is the power consumption of the overall system, which includes the power consumption of the ODU compressors, ODU fans and IDU fans. Besides the objective of maximizing the energy efficiency, there are operational constraints (e.g. inputs and states) imposed on some process variables. In this study, the cost function used is the sum of the normalized values of the combined compressor and ODU-fan power of an individual unit, augmented with the penalty for ensuring minimum superheat at the inlet of ODUs, i.e. (5) J aug = ∑ i = 1 N P Comp , i + P fan , i P Comp , i , r a t e d + P fan , i , r a t e d + a T SH - T SH , lim where a is the weight factor of penalty term, N is the number of ODUs, TSH,lim is the preset lower limit of the superheat temperature at the suction side of compressors, and subscript \u2018rated\u2019 indicates the rated power of a piece of equipment. 3.2 ODU staging control A set of control strategies for staging on and off ODUs is developed based on the compressor speed of the operating ODUs. With increasing load in the cooling operation IDUs, if the operating compressor(s) speed exceeds an upper limit, an additional ODU is turned on to meet the load. Under decreasing load conditions in the cooling operation IDUs, it is desirable to turn off the least efficient ODU in a model-free fashion. If the compressor speed of an ODU falls below a lower limit for a sufficient length of time, this ODU will be turned off. Assume the VRF system contains N ODUs, and the ascending order of the ODU index follows the decreasing order of compressor efficiency based on the a priori (or the latest) knowledge of the compressor efficiencies. Although, in principle, one may perform some optimum search, e.g. based on branch and bound algorithm, to rank the efficiencies of individual ODUs, this would not practical. If n (n < N) of them are in operation, then the (n + 1)th ODU will be turned on if the speed of an operating compressor goes beyond the preset upper bound Ω ¯ i (e.g. 80% of the rated speed) for duration τ ¯ i . The additional compressor speed follows the ramp change to 50% of the rated speed within 60 s and then the PI controller starts to regulate the compressor pressure (discharge pressure for heating operation and suction pressure for cooling operation) to setpoint. The suction-side BPV of the additional compressor will be adjusted to 40% opening within duration τ valve (60 s in the study), and C OL , i and C OR , i are open within during the same time period. To stage off an ODU, an ESC integrated control logic is proposed. As shown in Eq. (5), the compressor shaft power normalized by the rated capacity is part of the ESC feedback. Without loss of generality, assume that the isentropic efficiencies of the operating compressors can be ordered as (6) η is , 1 ⩾ η is , 2 ⩾ . . . ⩾ η is , n > 0 Under such ordering, the n th operating compressor would cost the most shaft power for the same enthalpy change, according to Eq. (1). To satisfy a specific load, the optimal setting for the compressor capacity distribution is that the less efficient compressor operates with lower capacity. This can be interpreted in an approximate manner as follows. As for multi-ODU VRF operation, in the approximate sense, all the evaporating heat exchangers units can be aggregated into one evaporator, and all the condensing heat exchangers can be aggregated into one condenser. For a given pattern of zonal loads, the demanded enthalpy change from all the operating compressors can be denoted as Ht . Then the optimal allocation of compressor capacity for load satisfaction can be obtained by solving the following constrained optimization problem (7a) min ∑ i = 1 n P comp , i subject to (7b) ∑ i = 1 n P comp , i · η is , i = H t (7c) P ¯ comp , i ⩾ P comp , i ⩾ P - comp , i where P ¯ comp , i and P - comp , i denote the maximum and minimum power consumption for the i -th compressor, respectively. As Pcomp , i and ηis , i are all positive, a feasible solution to (7a) will be that Pcomp , i be smaller for smaller ηis , i . Therefore, with the ESC based online optimization of ODU load sharing using the normalized total power, less efficient compressor(s) will be driven to operate at lower speed/power. If the compressor speed of ODU-k ( k = 1 , ⋯ , n + 1 ) falls below the preset lower limit of operational speed ranges Ω - k (e.g. 20% of the rated speed) for duration τ - k , this ODU will be turned off with the BP V CD , i fully open to the other side using a linear ramp of duration τvalve and the compressor speed will be decreased from Ω - k to 0 also using a linear ramp within duration τvalve , and meanwhile C OL , i and C OR , i are closed. The state transition diagram for the ODU staging-on and staging\u2013off sequences is shown in Fig. 4 . For a typical diurnal cycle of load variation, the staging-off process for the multi-ODU VRF system will yield the efficiency ranking of the individual ODU compressors, and thus the staging-on sequence of the next load cycle can be carried out based on such efficiency ranking information. 3.3 ODU heat exchanger mode switching logic For simultaneous heating and cooling operation of multi-ODU VRF systems, the heat exchangers of ODUs can be operated as either an evaporator or a condenser. As the heating/cooling mode of an IDU is set by the occupant, the operation of the ODU-HXs (evaporating/condensing) can significantly affect the thermal balance and thus the energy efficiency. As shown in Fig. 5 , an ODU-HX with switchable mode can be used as a \u2018wild card\u2019 for optimizing the thermal balance, i.e. reducing the compressor load for maximizing the operational efficiency while the thermal comfort requirement is satisfied. If the heat exchanger characteristics are known, it is straightforward to apply model-based control/optimization methods for optimizing the heat exchanger modes. However, as indicated earlier, such model acquisition/calibration process can be prohibitively expensive. Therefore, a model-free mode switching strategy is proposed for determining the ODU heat exchanger operation. Under increasing load in the heating operation IDUs, if the EEV opening of one or more IDUs exceeds an upper limit, one of the ODUs switches from operation as a condenser to operation as an evaporator. The total power of the VRF system, which includes the ODU power, is used as the ESC feedback. Without affecting the generality of the proposed logic, the following conditions are used here to facilitate the demonstration of the switching logic: 1) The compressors have the same efficiency characteristics. 2) The efficiencies for individual ODU-HXs can be different. 3) All the ODU fans have the same design and capacity. Without loss of generality, the heat transfer efficiencies of the ODU-HXs can be ordered as (8) η ODU - H X , 1 ≥ η ODU - H X , 2 ≥ ⋯ ≥ η ODU - H X , n while this order is unknown to the operator in the context of model free control. The total heat transfer rate for ODU-i can be expressed as (9) m ̇ ODU , f a n , i × Δ T ODU , a i r , i = η ODU - H X , i × Q ̇ ODU - H X , i where m ̇ ODU , f a n , i is the air mass flow rate of the ODU-i fan, and Δ T ODU , a i r , i is the temperature differential between the ODU fan inlet and outlet, and Q ̇ ODU - H X , i is the ideal heat transfer rate of i -th ODU HX. For normal fan operation, the fan power is monotonic function of the air mass flow rate. Therefore, under the same total heat transfer rate and air-side temperature difference for the ODU heat exchangers, the fan powers for individual ODUs are ordered as (10) P ODU - f a n , 1 ≥ P ODU - f a n , 2 ≥ ⋯ ≥ P ODU - f a n , n With ESC designed to minimize the total power, the online optimization process will drive the least-efficient fan and coil combination of the ODU-HX to operate at a lower fan speed (i.e. to use less fan power for a less efficient unit). The state transition diagram for the ODU-HX mode switching sequences is shown in Fig. 6 . In the cooling dominant operation mode, with the decreasing ratio of cooling load to the heating load, the opening ( ϕ H , j ) of EEV HI, j (for the heating operation of IDU- j) becomes saturated at the upper limit ( ϕ H , j , m a x ) for a given period ( τ s ), the ODU-HX with the lowest fan speed will be switched from the condenser mode to the evaporator mode. The corresponding cooling-mode valve is closed ( C OL , i and C OR , i ) and the heating-mode valve is opened ( EE V O , i and H O , i ) within a specific period, e.g. 60 s. The EE V O , i is then used to regulate the SH temperature at the suction side of the compressors, with the initial setpoint of 7 °C. The discharge-side BPV is fully open to the heating-operation IDU-HX side within 60 s. The fan mass flow rate is fixed at the value found by ESC before the start of the mode switching process. In the heating dominant mode, with the decreasing ratio of heating load to the cooling load, the opening ( ϕ C , j ) of EEVI, j (for cooling operation of IDU-j) will be saturated at the upper limit ( ϕ C , j , m a x ). If saturation persists for the specified period ( τ s ), the ODU-HX with the lowest fan speed will switch its operation mode from evaporator to condenser. The corresponding heating-mode valves ( EE V O , i and H O , i ) will be closed, and the cooling-mode valves ( C OL , i and C OR , i ) will be opened within 60 s. The BPV at the compressor discharge side is open to the ODU-HX side within 60 s. 4 Simulation study The ESC integrated ODU staging strategies proposed in Section 3 are evaluated with the Modelica based simulation model described in Section 2. Cases #1 and #2 are used to illustrate the scenarios of ODU staging-on and staging-off, respectively. Case #3 illustrates the scenario of ODU-HX mode switching. For Cases #1 and #2, the system is assumed to operate in the all-cooling mode. The ambient temperature and relative humidity are set to be 35 °C and 40% RH, respectively. In Case #3, the system is initialized to operate in the simultaneous heating and cooling mode. All the three ODU HXs work as condensers. The ambient temperature and relative humidity are set to be 20 °C and 30%RH, respectively. For all three cases, the cooling-IDU temperature setpoint is 27 °C and the heating-IDU temperature setpoint is 24 °C. In addition, the rated compressor speed for all ODUs is set as 80 Hz, therefore the upper limit Ω ¯ i = 64 Hz and the lower limit Ω _ i = 16 Hz. The ESC design for the simulation cases are summarized in the Table 3 . The weight factor a in Eq. (5) is selected as 3800 for the compressor staging-on and -off simulation cases. The corresponding low-pass and band-pass filters for each ESC manipulated inputs are designed as: (11) F LP ( s ) = ω LP 2 s 2 + 2 ω LP s + ω LP 2 (12) F BP ( s ) = 2 ω BP s s 2 + 2 ω BP s + ω BP 2 4.1 Case #1: ODU staging-on with increasing load Figs. 7 and 8 show the simulation results of this case. In Fig. 7, the trajectories of the total zonal load, the zone temperature, the superheat temperature at the suction side of the compressors, and the compressor speeds are shown. The load applied to each IDU is identical and the capacity of each IDU is the same. Therefore, the zonal temperature is identical for each operating IDU, and only the temperature trajectory of Zone #1 is plotted. The ESC inputs and output (i.e. the total power) trajectories are shown in Fig. 8. The manipulated inputs are ODU fan mass flow rate, compressor suction-side pressure and the BPV openings. The simulation is divided into five segments: - Segment 1: ESC for one-ODU operation; - Segment 2: load increase and additional ODU staging-on operation; - Segment 3: ESC for two-ODU operation; - Segment 4: load increase and additional ODU staging-on operation; - Segment 5: ESC for three-ODU operation. The simulation scenario starts with a low load demand for the first 30 min. The initial load of each IDU is set as 0.9 kW. The ODU-1 itself has sufficient capacity to service this level of load. For Segment 1, the ESC is turned on at t = 30 min. The ESC manipulated inputs are the compressor suction pressure setpoint and the ODU-1 fan mass flow rate. A simulation based optimization procedure using a genetic algorithm (GA) method [15] is applied to find the global optimum for the inputs and the total power consumption, shown as red dashed lines in the plots. The GA method finds the globally minimum total power at 2934.5 W, with PCS at 13.75 bar and the ODU fan mass flow rate at 0.97 kg/s. ESC converges to an average total power of 2950.8 W in steady state, with P CS settled around 13.6 bar and ODU fan mass flow rate around 0.95 kg/s. Compared to the GA results, the steady-state error is about 0.6%. The power consumption of the single-ODU operation period is decreased from 5034.8 W at its arbitrary starting condition to 2950.8 W, i.e. by 41.3%, with the 2% settling time of about 50 min. Segment 2 starts at t = 270 min, when the cooling load of each IDU is increased linearly over a one-hour period, increasing from 0.9 kW to 1 kW, as shown in Fig. 7. With this increase in cooling load, the ODU-1 compressor speed reaches Ω ¯ 1 for 30 s, and then ODU-2 is turned on following the proposed ODU staging-on logic described earlier. Segment 2 shows the transition period for the staging-on process, in which the ESC is turned off and all its manipulated inputs are reset to the respective initial values, i.e. P CS is set as 12 bar and the ODU fan mass flow rate is set as 1.8 kg/s. During the staging-on process, the ODU-2 cooling-mode valves C OL , 2 and C OR , 2 are opened within 60 s. The compressor speed is increased linearly to 40 Hz within 60 s and the fan mass flow rate for ODU-2 is increased linearly to 1.8 kg/s within 60 s. For the ODU-2 compressor staging-on process, since the compressor speed for ODU-2 operates initially in open loop, the compressor speed of ODU-1 (which is operating in closed loop) shows a relatively large drop at 350 min. In spite of a significant disturbance with the second compressor staged on, the suction pressure of compressor remains well-regulated at its setpoint. After the startup process of ODU-2 has completed, the ESC for two-ODU operation is turned on at t = 420 min to seek the optimum for the manipulated inputs of PCS , ODU fan mass flow rate and BPV CS ,1 opening (i.e. Segment 3 in Figs. 6 and 7). The GA method finds the global minimum of total power at 3650.3 W, with PCS at 13.75 bar, the BPV CS ,1 opening at 78% and the ODU fan mass flow rate at 1.13 kg/s. ESC converges to an average total power of 3674.5 W in steady state, with the P CS around 14 bar, the BPV CS ,1 opening around 68% and ODU fan mass flow rate around 1.25 kg/s. Compared to the GA results, the steady-state error in power is about 1.6%. The power consumption for the two-ODU operation period decreased from 6917.5 W to 3674.5 W, i.e. by 45.1%, with the 2% settling time of about 50 min. The final load increase is applied at t = 780 min. In this case the load of each IDU is increased linearly from 1 kW to 2.2 kW per IDU over 60 min. This is shown as Segment 4 in Fig. 7. Due to the increasing load, the ODU-1 and ODU-2 compressor speeds reach Ω ¯ 1 and Ω ¯ 2 for 30 s, and then ODU-3 is turned on. During the staging-on process, the ODU-3 cooling-mode valves C OL , 3 and C OR , 3 are opened within 60 s. The compressor speed is ramped up to 40 Hz within 60 s and the fan mass flow rate for ODU-3 is increased linearly to 1.8 kg/s within 60 s. Once again, a disturbance in the suction pressure regulation is observed at t = 860 min. when the compressor for ODU-3 is staged on; however, aside from this, the suction pressure regulation is generally quite good. After the startup process of ODU-3, the ESC for three-ODU operation is turned on at t = 920 min (i.e. Segment 5) with the manipulated inputs of PCS , the ODU fan mass flow rate, and the BPV CS ,1 and BPV CS ,2 openings. The GA method finds the global minimum of total power at 5352.2 W, with PCS at 12.48 bar, BPV CS ,1 opening at 78%, BPV CS ,2 opening at 52% and the ODU fan mass flow rate at 1.37 kg/s. ESC converges to an average total power of 5440.5 W in steady state, with P CS around 12.7 bar, BPV CS ,1 opening around 71%, BPV CS ,2 opening around 50% and ODU fan mass flow rate around 1 kg/s. Compared to the GA results, the steady-state error of the total power is about 2.8%. The power consumption of the three-ODU operation period decreases from 8627.1 W to 5440.5 W, i.e. by 34.2%, with the 2% settling time of about 80 min. Then the energy efficiency performance is evaluated in Fig. 9 for Segments 1, 3 and 5 of simulated operation. As the load condition in each segment of operational period is set constant and the inner loop control has achieved load satisfaction properly, comparison of power consumption is equivalent to comparison of the coefficient of performance (COP) for system operation. For each segment, a relative energy efficiency is calculated by normalizing the ESC steady-state power consumption with the power consumption by the offline GA based global optimization (labeled as \u2018Simulation Based Optimization Result in Fig. 9) for the operating condition. Also, for each segment, such energy efficiency is evaluated for the operating setting before ESC is applied, which is named \u2018Normal Condition Result\u2019 in Fig. 9. Comparison between the ESC Steady-state Result and the Simulation Based Optimization Result values indicates how close the ESC can converge the operation to the actual optimum, while the comparison between the ESC Steady-state Result and the Normal Condition Result values indicate the efficiency gain with ESC. The comparisons reveal that ESC can drive the operation very close to the actual optimum, and the efficiency gain is substantial compared to the operating setting before the respective ESC starts. 4.2 Case #2: ODU staging-off with decreasing load The ODU staging-off scenario is simulated in Case #2. Figs. 10 and 11 plot the simulation results in the same fashion as Figs. 7 and 8. The simulation is divided into three segments: - Segment 1: ESC for three-ODU operation; - Segment 2: load decrease and ODU staging-off operation; - Segment 3: ESC for two-ODU operation; The system is initially operated at a high demand, with the cooling load of each IDU set at 2.2 kW. All three ODUs are operated to meet the load requirement. The ESC for three-ODU operation is turned on at 60 min to search for the optimum of the ODU fan mass flow rate, BPV CS ,1 and BPV CS ,2 openings, and compressor suction pressure setpoints, with the results shown in segment 1. The GA results are again shown as red dashed lines in the plots, with the global minimum values of total power at 5910.4 W, with PCS at 12.4 bar, BPV CS ,1 opening at 67%, BPV CS ,2 opening at 45% and the ODU fan mass flow rate at 0.9 kg/s. ESC converges to an average total power of 6043.8 W in steady state, with P CS around 12.6 bar, BPV CS ,1 opening about 70%, BPV CS ,2 opening around 46% and ODU fan mass flow rate around 1.1 kg/s. Compared to the GA results, the steady-state error in power is about 1.6%. The total power consumption of the three-ODU operation decreases from 12039.2 W at the arbitrary starting condition to 5945.3 W, i.e. by 50.6%, with the 2% settling time of about 50 min. Then, in Segment 2, the cooling load of each IDU is decreased linearly from 2.2 kW to 1.5 kW over a 60-minute time interval beginning at t = 340 min. With this decrease in cooling load, the compressor speed of ODU-3 has the lowest speed and stays at the lower limit Ω _ 3 for 30 s, and then ODU-3 is turned off following the proposed ODU staging-off logic described earlier. The ESC is turned off by freezing the relevant manipulated inputs at their current levels. The associated valve actions follow the relevant control logic as described in Section 3. After the staging-off process, the operation enters Segment 3, and the ESC for two-ODU operation is turned on at t = 460 min. For Segment 3 the manipulated inputs are PCS , ODU fan mass flow rate and BPV CS ,1 opening. The GA method finds the global minimum of total power at 4680.4 W, with PCS at 13.4 bar, the BPV CS ,1 opening at 67% and the ODU fan mass flow rate at 0.75 kg/s. ESC converges to an average total power of 4733.2 W in steady state, with P CS around 13.2 bar, the BPV opening around 69% and ODU fan mass flow rate around 0.79 kg/s. Compared to the GA results, the steady-state error in power is about 2.8%. The total power consumption of two-ODU operation decreases during this period from 6288.9 W to 4733.2 W, i.e. by 25.1%, with the 2% settling time of about 50 min. Similar to Fig. 9, the energy efficiencies for Segments 1 and 3 are plotted as in Fig. 12 . Again, ESC is shown to achieve near-optimum operation and the improvement of efficiency with ESC is clearly demonstrated. 4.3 Case #3: ODU-HX operation mode switch with increasing heating load Finally, the ODU-HX mode switching scenario is simulated with a scenario of increasing heating load. In this case, the three compressor efficiencies are assumed identical, while the ODU fan efficiencies and ODU-HX fin efficiencies are set to be different. The detailed information of the ODU-HX and fan settings is summarized in Table A1 of the Appendix. The simulation period is divided into three segments: - Segment 1: ESC for three ODUs operating as condensers; - Segment 2: heating load increase and ODU-HX mode switching operation; - Segment 3: ESC operation with two ODU-HXs operated as condenser and one ODU-HX operated as an evaporator. Fig. 13 shows the profiles of zonal load, zonal temperature and EEV opening for each heating and cooling IDU, respectively. The heating-IDU zonal load experiences a ramp change in the middle of the simulation, while the load for the cooling IDU is kept constant throughout the simulated period. Zones #1 through #4 are in heating operation, each with identical heating load. Zones #5 through #12 are in cooling operation, again each with identical cooling load. The temperature profiles for Zone #1 and Zone #5 are plotted as representative of the heating and cooling zones, respectively. The VRF system is initially operated in a cooling dominant mode, with the cooling load for each of the eight cooling-IDUs set as 2 kW and the heating load for each of the four heating-IDUs set as 500 W. All three ODU-HXs are operated as condensers to meet the load requirement, for which C OL , i and C OR , i are open while E EV O , i and H O , i are closed. Fig. 14 shows the trajectories of ESC inputs and output. The initial values of the ODU fan mass flow rate and PCS are set to be 1.5 kg/s and 8 bar, respectively. The ESC for three-ODU operation is turned on at t = 60 min to search for the optimum of the ODU fan mass flow rate and compressor suction pressure setpoints, with the results shown in Segment 1. Again, the GA results red dashed lines achieve the global minimum values of total power, PCS , and the ODU fan mass flow rate at 5640 W, 12 bar and 1.1 kg/s, respectively. ESC converges to an average total power of 5670 W in steady state, with P CS around 12.1 bar and ODU fan mass flow rate around 1.1 kg/s. Compared to the GA results, the ESC steady-state error in power is about 1.5%. The total power consumption of three-ODU operation period decreases from 7742 W corresponding to the arbitrary starting condition to 5670 W, i.e. by 26.7%, with the 2% settling time of about 60 min. Then, in Segment 2, the load of each heating-IDU increases linearly over a 60-minute interval from 500 W to 1 kW beginning at t = 580 min. With the heating load increased, the heating-IDU EEV opening is saturated at the higher limit ϕ H , j , m a x for 60 s. Meanwhile, ODU3-HX shows the lowest fan speed (i.e. being the least efficient), and thus its operational mode is switched from condenser to evaporator. The ESC is turned off during this period of operation, with the relevant inputs frozen at their current values. The control actions are then carried out switching the operation mode of the least efficient ODU-HX from condenser to evaporator. During the mode switching process, COL, 3 and COR ,3 are closed, and EEVO ,3 and HO ,3 are opened within 60 s. EEVO ,3 is then used to regulate the SH temperature at the compressor suction side. After the ODU-HX mode switching is finished, the operation enters Segment 3 in which the ESC is turned on to find the optimum of ODU fan mass flow rate and PCS setpoint. The GA method finds the global minimum of total power at 5500 W, with PCS at 12.6 bar and the ODU fan mass flow rate at 0.95 kg/s. ESC converges to an average total power of 5521 W in steady state, with the P CS around 12.4 bar and ODU fan mass flow rate around 1 kg/s. Compared to the GA results, the steady-state error of the total power is about 3.3%. The total power consumption of two-ODU operation period decreases from 5795.8 W to 5521 W, i.e. by 4.9%, with the 2% settling time of about 100 min. The relative energy efficiency for Segments 1 and 3 are again plotted in Fig. 15 . ESC\u2019s optimum tracking capability is again shown with the comparison with the simulation based optimization method. It is noteworthy that, for Segment 3, the difference between the ESC Steady-state Result and the Normal Condition Result is smaller than all other cases in Figs. 9, 12 and 15, which just indicates that the initial setting for Segment 3 happens to be closer to the actual optimum. The effectiveness of the proposed control strategy has been demonstrated in the above three cases. The model-free real-time optimization algorithm is integrated with the multiple ODU staging on and off control strategy and also the ODU heat exchanger mode switch control strategy. The proposed ODU staging on and off control strategy can guide the system operation as the energy efficiency way with the increasing or decreasing load condition. Moreover, the ODU heat exchanger mode switch control strategy can provide the solution for the better thermal balance and also the efficiency operation of the system. 5 Conclusion and discussion This paper describes an ESC integrated model-free automatic staging strategy for a multi-ODU VRF system with time varying loads. Two staging strategies are presented, including: 1) the staging of ODU based on compressor efficiency, and 2) mode switching of the ODU heat exchanger based on ODU fan efficiency. The ODU staging-off process takes advantage of the real-time optimization benefit of extremum seeking in finding the least efficient ODU compressor, while the staging-on process can be carried out by the compressor efficiency ranking determined by the previous occurrence of staging-off operation. Since diurnal building operation generally experiences cyclic load changes, the automatic staging-off control logic proposed in this paper can update the compressor efficiency ranking on a daily basis. The problem of ODU heat exchanger mode switching is a unique challenge and opportunity due to the heat recovery operation when heating and cooling are simultaneously enabled by particular load patterns. When particular IDU(s) cannot regulate the thermal comfort, the proposed control logic switches the operational mode for the least efficient ODU heat exchanger based on the corresponding fan efficiency. The proposed strategies are evaluated with a Modelica simulation model of a VRF system with three ODUs and 12 IDUs. The ODU staging strategies are validated with simulations of all-cooling scenarios, while the mode switching strategies for ODU heat exchangers are validated with the simulations of simultaneous heating and cooling scenarios. By incorporating the normalized total power into the objective function for ESC, the ODU staging-off operation can automatically turn off the least efficient ODU without the need for model knowledge when the cooling load decreases. In addition, the ESC results under different number of ODUs have shown good convergence with reasonable settling time to the optimum found by a simulation based global optimization process. Then, the mode switching of ODU heat exchanger is illustrated with a scenario of increasing heating load. It is noteworthy that the mode switching of the ODU heat exchangers represents a novel operation compared to the operation of many other building HVAC systems. For typical HVAC systems, the compressor and fan of an ODU are operated in a synchronized fashion. For the heat recovery mode of multi-ODU VRF systems, as illustrated in this study, the ODU heat exchanger (and its fan) operation can be decoupled from the operation of the compressor(s) in the same packaged unit. This also reveals that the efficiency of the ODU fan and coil and the ODU compressor efficiency can be considered separately. With this understanding, the illustrative example of ODU staging operation does not lose its generality with the assumption of identical efficiency characteristics for all ODU heat exchangers and fans; while for the ODU-HX mode switching algorithm, the effectiveness of the illustrative simulation study would not be affected by whether the efficiencies of individual ODU compressors are the same or different would not affect the evaluation.

        "dc:description": "This paper presents a model-free control and automatic staging strategy for the operation of a variable refrigerant flow system with multiple outdoor units, which maximizes energy efficiency in real time and handles the outdoor-unit operation during load changes. An extremum seeking controller is used to minimize the total power consumption in real time while the thermal load is regulated with inner loop controllers. Minimization of power with extremum seeking control leads naturally to manipulated input behavior that can be utilized to develop control logic for two aspects of multi-outdoor-unit operation in model-free manner: (1) automatically stage off the outdoor unit with least efficient compressor, and (2) automatically switch the operation of outdoor-unit heat exchanger between the evaporating and condensing mode for simultaneous heating and cooling. As the extremum seeking controller can drive the least-efficient compressor to a lower capacity, the outdoor unit with the least efficient compressor can thus be identified and turned off in a model-free manner under a decreasing load. Under simultaneous heating and cooling operation, the fan speed of the least efficient outdoor-unit heat exchanger will be lower than all other outdoor units, which indicates that the heat exchanger can be switched between operation as a condenser and evaporator to achieve thermal balance for higher efficiency. The proposed strategy is evaluated using a Modelica model of a variable-refrigerant-flow system that consists of three outdoor units and 12 indoor units. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated with the simulation study.",
