Division of Architecture and Urban Design Incheon National University Incheon 22012 Korea Sensor errors have a considerable influence on the system operation and energy usage in an air handling unit. Sensor fault detection and diagnosis (SFDD) has been widely studied to handle the impacts of sensor errors on an air-handling unit (AHU). Beyond the SFDD, in-situ calibration can correct the faulty sensor (especially for systematic errors) automatically in field, thereby reducing the energy waste. In this study, we propose an advanced in-situ sensor calibration named virtual in-situ calibration in an operational AHU. The suggested method is intended to overcome the challenges of previous in-situ calibration methods by coupling the Bayesian inference and autoencoder. In a given sensor calibration domain of an AHU, based on the unsupervised learning neural network feature trained to duplicate their input variables, the autoencoder-coupled calibration can produce system and sensor models effectively without additional sensors and assumptions, which are the main limitations of the earlier methods. It improves the calibration performance and applicability in the AHU. In addition, a three-step strategy to construct autoencoder input variables and a new distance function to achieve successful calibration under various faulty conditions is proposed. In a case study, where the error in the cooling coil supply temperature (+2 °C) caused a total energy increase of 38%, the present method is shown to eliminate the sensor error and the energy waste completely. These results show the capabilities and potentials of the suggested method in the self-repair, diagnostics, and automation of a building energy sector. Keywords Fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) Virtual in-situ calibration (VIC) AutoEncoder Bayesian inference Air-handling unit Sensors 1 Introduction An air-handling unit (AHU), one of main devices in a Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system, controls air conditions (such as temperature, relative humidity, and CO2) and thus provides thermal comfort and good indoor air quality in a building. However, at the same time, it also consumes considerable energy as it affects the operation of primary systems such as a chiller and a boiler. Recently, in order to reduce the energy consumption in the building while improving the occupants\u2019 environments, various AHU technologies and applications, which include features of optimization [1], control [2], diagnostics [3], and prognostics [4], have been widely developed. In particular, these developments have emerged through the innovation of sensor networks and data-driven approaches in the field of building automation and energy management. Considering that the newly suggested technologies are usually developed based on data, and then connected to operational sensor networks, modeling of a building sensing environment has become more significant. While developing building sensing environments, some of the practical issues are avoiding redundancy, embedding and distributing sensors in the system, and handling errors from sensor readings [5]. In particular, sensor errors in the AHU, which mainly consist of a random error and a bias error (or offset), have significant impact on indoor environmental quality and energy use [6]. The random error is the difference between each of the measurements and their mean, which is usually represented by the standard deviation of a normal distribution. The bias is the distance between the mean and the true value of measurements; if the bias changes over time, it is regarded as a drift error. When the bias is caused by the working environment and is not due to the sensor, it is termed as a systematic error. In the AHU, handling systematic errors is quite challenging as existing sensor calibration methods (e.g., periodic calibration) cannot identify the working environment [6]. For example, it was reported that temperature sensors in a unitary air-conditioner had large systematic errors (up to 19.2 °C) owing to the radiant heat exchange between the sensors and the surrounding heating device; this occurred despite the sensors being calibrated well in advance [7]. There have been studies that have examined the impact of AHU systematic errors on a building using simulations with fault models [8\u201312], in which the impact was quantified in terms of energy consumption, occupant thermal comfort, and/or primary system operation and performance. When the latest applications (such as predictive control, virtual sensing, fault detection and diagnosis, and prognostic systems) are greatly dependent on the performance of sensors, negative impacts caused by the sensor error can be enormous and can propagate throughout the building. The sensor fault detection and diagnosis (SFDD) of AHU can alleviate the big impacts of sensor errors in operational buildings. Advancements in SFDD have been made by rule-based, model-based, data-driven, and combined approaches [13,14]. For instance, Wang and Xiao [15] suggested a principal component analysis-based SFDD with two balances (heat and pressure-flow) and FDD rules. Du et al. [16] proposed dual neural networks for sensor fault detection of AHU. Zhao et al. [17] developed SFDD of AHU based on diagnostic Bayesian networks that can fuse all diagnostic information; the diagnostic information may be in the form of experts\u2019 knowledge and experiences, physical laws, etc. Yan et al. [18] presented an unsupervised learning-based method using cluster analysis. Even though they can detect sensor faults and/or identify which sensors are wrong with the error types in AHU, it proved to be difficult to determine the true measurements (and hence error magnitudes). Successfully detecting and diagnosing faulty sensors is not sufficient to prepare reliable datasets for the operation and development of other data-driven technologies. Above all, the systematic errors captured by SFDD cannot be perfectly handled by the conventional sensor calibration methods. In-situ sensor calibration can be regarded as the next generation technology of SFDD when considered from the perspective of the self-repairing function (particularly for systematic errors) of building automation. Moreover, in-situ calibration can be substituted for the advanced SFDD as it is capable of detecting and diagnosing sensor errors. Furthermore, it can even calibrate operational datasets based on the dissimilarity between sensor readings before and after the calibration. These calibrated datasets can be widely used for (1) monitoring/controlling systems, and (2) training/testing various data-driven applications, thereby improving their performance; in this regard, in-situ calibration potentially offer greater advantages when compared with SFDD. In various fields, in-situ calibration methods have been developed; for example, computer science [19,20], chemistry [21\u201323], optical engineering [24,25], etc. [26,27]. These methods provide good calibration performance when judged on the basis of dense deployment of sensors, reference sensor readings, known conditions, and use of additional equations; they effectively eliminate unknown parameters for a known (better) calibration environment. These in-situ calibration technologies have been effectively developed in fields where sensor redundancy, high quality sensors, or known relationships between sensors do exist. However, it is considerably difficult to adopt any of these approaches in building energy systems because the building sensing environment is not mass-produced or well instrumented. Virtual in-situ calibration (VIC) has been previously proposed as the in-situ sensor calibration method of building energy systems [6,28\u201333]. In an early version of VIC, the calibration was done under the assumption that the erroneous sensor is known [6]. The extended VIC proposed by (Yoon and Yu) [28] can calibrate multiple sensors simultaneously using Bayesian inference without the assumption of knowing which sensors are faulty beforehand. In the extended calibration formulation, the system and sensor models have to be constructed corresponding to system output and input variables respectively. However, for an operational AHU, the balance calculations (energy, heat, mass, etc.) for system models require additional sensors in both the demand and supply sides even though they are unnecessary for system operation and control. It is also difficult to prepare the individual sensor model of AHU variables. Although various learning algorithms establish the data-driven models of system variables [3], the process requires other reliable variables outside the target calibration domain [16] or the model accuracy is not sufficient within the domain (as is shown for Case 1 in this study). These requirements and challenges hamper the efficient applicability of VIC in an operational AHU. Autoencoder (AE) is a neural network that can reconstruct the input variables of original datasets, is termed as unsupervised learning, and has been widely used in diagnostic systems in various fields [34\u201337]. While the model trained by AE in normal conditions can reconstruct the data, it fails when encountering faulty conditions. Thus, the difference between the original and reconstructed data (reconstruction error) can be used as a criterion for fault detection [34,35]. The features of latent space created by AE have also been used for fault diagnosis [36,37]. Unlike traditional supervised learning structures (multiple Xs to a single Y), AE is able to construct overall relations between all variables (multiple Xs to multiple Xs) at the same time for fault detection and diagnosis. Based on this feature, the balance principles of AHU can be considered without the physical calculation, and data-driven models for AHU variables can be built more accurately inside the limited calibration domain. Accordingly, the hypothesis of this study is that coupling AE and Bayesian inference of the existing VIC overcomes the challenges of in-situ sensor calibration in a building sensing environment, and thereby allows VIC to possess a sensor self-healing function that goes beyond the capabilities of SFDD. This article suggests an advanced in-situ sensor calibration method based on the capabilities of AE, thereby allowing the suggested method to be applied to operational air-handling units without being hindered by previous requirements and limitations. A strategy to construct input variables of AE is also proposed with a new distance function of VIC to achieve good calibration performance in various fault conditions. In Section 2, the existing VIC method is introduced along with the challenges in operational air-handling units. A novel method based on the coupling of Bayesian inference and AE is suggested in Section 3, which is then applied to the typical variable air volume (VAV) system of a small-sized office building in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 discusses the suggested method in terms of calibration accuracy and system energy saving, and comparisons are made with the existing method. 2 Existing VIC and its challenges in operational air-handling unit 2.1 Background and formulation The VIC method was proposed to calibrate multiple working sensors, virtually or in-situ, in building energy systems [6]. It is capable of handling various systematic, bias and random errors of sensors using Bayesian inference; this is shown in Eqs. (1) and (2). The posterior distributions of unknown correction constants are estimated by the Bayesian calculation using prior information about sensor errors before the calibration, decreasing the system and sensor uncertainties caused by sensor errors and unknown parameters of system models. To do so, the likelihood function of Bayesian inference is defined to give the higher probability at the lower uncertainties for an operation period (T) using a normal distribution (see Eq. (3)). (1) P ( x | Y ) = P ( Y | x ) × π ( x ) P ( Y ) (2) P ( Y ) = ∫ P ( Y | x ) π ( x ) d x (3) P ( Y | x ) = ∏ t = 1 T 1 σ 2 π exp [ − 1 2 σ 2 D ( x ) ] where x represents the variables including correction constants and unknown parameters, Y is the observation, π(x) is the prior distribution of the variables, P(x|Y) is the posterior distribution of the variables, P(Y|x)is the likelihood function, T is the total number of datasets for an operation period, t is the counter for datasets,P(Y)is the normalizing constant, and σ is the standard deviation. The overall uncertainty for system and sensors was represented by the distance function of VIC; this is shown in Eq. (4), and it has two terms: model calibration and sensor calibration. Model calibration measures the difference between the known (YR,h ) and calculated (Yb,h ) system output, which is formulated based on the method used in a general model calibration approach [38,39]. The balance principles of AHU can be introduced to define YR,h . Sensor calibration shows the system variable errors between the measured and modeled values. The modeled system outputs Yb,h (Eq. 5) and variables Yb,i (Eq. 6) of the two terms are calculated by the multiple correction functions, corresponding to related working sensors and some unknown parameters (if they exist), using the available models (fI and fO ). Each of the correction functions, as given in Eq. (7), is defined by the measured value and an unknown correction constant to correct a hidden error. In other words, the VIC process is conducted to statistically find the accurate correction constants for working sensors in the system through the minimization of a distance function within the Bayesian inference.

In an air-handling unit, available balance equations (in terms of variables such as heat, energy, and pressure-flow) can be used at the demand and supply sides (e.g., air side and water side at a coil) for the model calibration term. However, it is usually difficult to calculate the system models in the operational system owing to the absence of key sensors for the calculation. For example, sensors are unnecessary at the air inlet of coils in terms of the control. If the inlet sensors are deployed for the heat balance calculation, they should also be included in the VIC problem for their calibration. In addition, sensors at the other side (e.g., water side) should be assumed to be normal to determine the reliable output value (YR,h ) for the air-side sensor calibration if YR,h is not directly metered/measured. For the sensor calibration term, it is harder to prepare an available sensor model for each of the system variables, which is then compared to the corresponding sensor. For example, how is the model of supply air temperature in AHU obtained? Even if the equation from the physical relationships with other variables in the system is defined, the local calibration domain (e.g., a cooling coil) is extended; thus the additional relations are also required for the newly introduced variables. Otherwise, additional data-driven modeling is required to have the models of system variables. These issues for the two terms require unnecessary sensors, thereby increasing the number of calibration variables in the VIC problem. This may result in an underdetermined problem owing to the increased number of variables under the limited equations. Various undesired effects, including cancellation effect [29] and sensitivity effect [31,32], can occur in the underdetermined condition, causing low calibration performance or failure; these negative effects have been previously discussed [33]. In summary, the challenges in applying VIC to the operational AHU are as follows: (1) Absence of sensors in model calculation at each of the system components. (2) Needs of additional sensors for VIC that are unnecessary for system control. (3) Assumption that the opposite system side is reliable in defining YR,h . (4) Insufficient sensor models of system variables. 3 Autoencoder-coupled VIC method This section suggests the advanced VIC method by combining with autoencoder to overcome the practical issues discussed in the previous section. 3.1 Framework and process The proposed in-situ calibration method has three stages: (1) Autoencoder training, (2) VIC formulation, and (3) In-situ calibration; a schematic of the method is shown in Fig. 1 . In the development stage, the autoencoder is trained. To achieve successful calibration, it is particularly important that autoencoder input variables be selected correctly. Then, the VIC problem is formulated for working sensors in a given calibration domain. Each sensor has a correction function, as defined by Eq. (7), in the VIC formulation. The difference between corrected and reconstructed variables in the trained autoencoder is defined as a new distance function of VIC. In the operational stage, Bayesian inference with the autoencoder-driven distance function is solved for calibration period (T) based on the operational datasets (such as measurements from working sensors, metered data, and system control signals) to estimate the unknown correction constants of the correction functions. The measurements from each working sensor are calibrated in-situ using the estimated constants in a correction function. The different steps of the method are described in greater detail in the following subsections. 3.2 Autoencoder (AE) Autoencoders [40] are neural networks that are trained to duplicate their input variables (x), as shown in Fig. 2 . The training procedure is unsupervised learning with no labeled data, and the minimization process of a cost function that makes equivalence between the given and duplicated input variables. The cost function E (Eq. (8)) is defined by the error index between the original input x and the reconstructed input x ^ obtained from the autoencoder; in this case, E is the mean squared error. (8) E = 1 N ∑ n = 1 N ∑ k = 1 K ( x k n − x ^ k n ) 2 ︸ mean squared error where E is the cost function (mean squared error), N is the number of observations (datasets), K is the number of variables in the training data, n is the counter for observations, k is the counter for variables, x is the original input variables of autoencoder, and x ^ is the reconstructed variables by autoencoder. AE consists of an encoder and a decoder with the multiple layers, as shown in Fig.2. In the encoding stage, the input data vector x is mapped to a latent space z, as given in Eq. (9). During decoding, the latent vector z is converted back to the original input vector (reconstructed), as shown in Eq. (10). (9) z = h 1 ( W 1 x + b 1 ) (10) x ^ = h 2 ( W 2 z + b 2 ) where h is the transfer function, W is the weight matrix, b is bias vector, x is the input space, z is the latent space, x ^ is the reconstructed input space, and 1 and 2 indicates respectively the encoder and decoder. 3.3 Strategy to select the autoencoder input variables in AHU To obtain the advantages of autoencoder in VIC, it is important to determine the autoencoder input variables properly in an in-situ calibration domain. This section explains a strategy to choose the AE input variables for an effective autoencoder architecture in AHU, as shown in Fig. 3 . The proposed strategy has three steps: (1) All corrected measurements from correction functions are first selected in the AHU side. (2) Thereafter, the related information regarding their control signals, electrical power, etc. are included inside the AHU to reflect the inner balances. (3) Additional information outside the AHU (e.g., water sides, zones, and outdoors) is finally introduced to consider various balance principles with the outside. Such a construction is intended to have more physical relationships among system variables in the autoencoder model, which acts as a substitute for system and sensor models of the existing VIC without any additional requirements. 3.4 Autoencoder-driven distance function A new distance function (DAE ) was formulated, as shown in Eq. (11), based on an autoencoder. It is defined by the sum of differences between the corrected measurements with the measured system variables (original input data) and the reconstructed values provided by the autoencoder. In the first term on the right hand side of Eq. (11), Yc,i is the AHU variable modified using the correction function (g) as given by Eq. (7). When defining reliable information YRI,m and YRO,k (such as power, control signal, etc. inside and outside the calibration domain), VIC can reflect available balance principles (model calibration term effect) even without the actual balance calculations being made using new readings from new physical sensors. This is because the exact balances can be represented by the operational system relationships between the inside and outside of AHU in the trained AE model. From the perspective of the sensor calibration term, based on the autoencoder ability mentioned above, each of the system variables is also naturally modeled by the autoencoder training. The reconstructed variables by the autoencoder are compared to the corrected measurements using the new distance function. Compared to the supervised data-driven modeling (Xs to Y), the autoencoder-based sensor models can interact with each other as all variables are considered simultaneously during the training, thereby providing better accuracy of the sensor models. Such a new distance function does not require the following: (1) additional sensors for defining the model terms and (2) separate data-driven modeling for the sensor terms. The essential sensors for system operation and control are only included with related information in this calibration problem. That is why the new distance function DAE is simplified without requiring benchmark modeling for Yb,h and Yb,i . The existing limitations summarized in Section 2.2 can be overcome because of the well-constructed autoencoder of AHU.

The system is a standard variable air volume (VAV) system that includes an outside air economizer, hot water main coil, reheat coils, and central chilled water-cooling coil. This system is operated by the air handling controller. The controller regulates the coil water flow rates for cooling, heating, and re-heating to reach the set-point temperature defined at the outlet of each coil. For the airflow rate, the supply fan is operated to meet the set-point temperature of the zones in a target building as shown in Fig. 4. The target building equipped with the AHU is a typical small-size office building. Detailed information about the building and systems can be found in Table 1 . The suggested in-situ calibration is applied to two sensors at the cooling coil side (as a target calibration domain): (1) the cooling coil supply air temperature sensor (TCCSA ) for the AHU control and (2) the supply air mass flow rate sensor ( m ˙ S A ) for the airflow rate monitoring. As the suggested method does not require a model calibration term, as mentioned above, physical sensors for variables at the water side (necessary in older methods) were not included for this calibration. The reliable information provided from inside the AHU (YRI,m in Eq. (11)) consists of the supply fan electric power (PSF ). The same from outside the AHU (YRO,k in Eq. (11)) includes the chiller electric power (PChiller ) and the chilled water valve control signal (Cvalve ) from the chilled water loop. In EnergyPlus modeling, the system capacities were automatically determined using its auto sizing feature based on the typical meteorological year weather data of the studied location (Chicago). The autosizing calculation was conducted without any sensor errors. The time steps for the simulation were set at 60 per hour. This simulation calculates the electronic energy of a chiller, the gas energy of a boiler, the electronic pump energy consumptions of water loops, and the electronic energy of a supply fan. This model was defined by modifying the example file of 5ZoneWaterCooled_MultiZoneMinMaxRHControl.idf in the official EnergyPlus releases [41]. 4.2 Operational schedules and fault modeling Table 2 shows the operational schedules of this case study. Various sensor faults (defined in Table 3 ) are scheduled to occur after 10 a.m. on a particular day. The suggested VIC was conducted for two hours (11:01\u201313:00) to estimate the correction constants cancelling the given sensor errors. After the estimation period, the two sensors were corrected in-situ using the calculated correction constants in correction functions (g). Various fault conditions were designed for the two working sensors (cooling coil supply air temperature and supply air mass flow rate) at the cooling coil side to evaluate the suggested VIC method. As shown in Table 3, they consist of individual and combined conditions regarding systematic errors. In the individual conditions, the systematic error is given to either sensor. The combined condition has the different errors simultaneously provided for the two sensors. It is assumed that the positive systematic error (+2 °C) of the temperature sensor is caused by radiant heat exchange with the adjacent heating coil in the AHU, and the errors of mass flow rate sensor are caused by the inappropriate sensor location inside the supply duct. The systematic error of cooling coil supply air temperature (TCCSA ) in the target VAV can have a considerable effect on the operation and performance of other devices, including fan, chiller, boiler, and pump, in the overall HVAC, as they are controlled to match the coil supply air temperature measurements with the set-point temperature. In this study, the error influences are implemented using the EnergyPlus object of FaultModel:TemperatureSensorOffset:CoilSupplyAir. The formulation of the faulty temperature is defined in Eq. (12). On the other hand, the mass flow rate sensor errors only affect the measurement readings, and not the system operation and control as it does not have its own set-point in the VAV. Hence, the faults are just added to the true values, as in Eq. (13), for obtaining the faulty measurements in EnergyPlus. After the VIC estimation, the calculated correction constants for sensors, as given by Eqs. (14) and (15), are used to derive calibrated measurements in EnergyPlus.

In Case 1, the formulation of the distance function is given in Eq. (16); this is based on an existing VIC method [33]. As the sensors at water side were not introduced into the AHU calibration of this application, the distance function of Case 1 inevitably includes only the sensor calibration term. For the sensor calibration term, the two air-side variables (TCCSA and m ˙ S A ) were modeled by the other of the two, the metered chiller and supply fan power, and water valve control signal, respectively, as given in Eqs. (17\u201318). A typical back propagation neural network was used in MATLAB R2018b to develop the two sensor models (fI,CCSAT and fI,SAM ) with related variables. The Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm [42] was selected as the training algorithm; this algorithm can update the weight and bias of the neural network based on LM optimization for good accuracy with less training time. The training datasets (per minute) were obtained during the simulation period (1st week in Aug.) with different operation conditions. The simulation conditions are listed in Table 1. Finally, the sum of differences between the corrected and modeled values for the two variables was defined as the distance function of Case 1. The corrected values were defined by their correction constants, given by Eqs. (19) and (20). In Cases 2 and 3, the sum of differences between the corrected/measured and autoencoder-driven values are defined as the distance functions Eqs. (21) and (23). The autoencoder of Case 2 was trained only by the air-side variables (TCCSA , m ˙ S A , and PSF ), as given in Eq. (22), because the target sensors are installed at the AHU. It was a fragmentary idea and proceeded until step 2 in the suggested strategy (Fig. 3). While reliable information at the chilled water side (PChiller and Cvalve ) were provided for the calculation of the distance function see Eq. (23), the AE see Eq. (24) of Case 3 proceeded through the suggested three steps discussed in Section 3.3.

The AE cost function of Cases 2 and 3 see Eq. (25) is defined by adding new terms including L2 regularization and sparsity regularization; this is also called a sparse autoencoder [43] that achieves better performance of AE [44]. The sparsity regularization term can consider a large value when the average output activation value ( ρ ^ i ) of a neuron i and the predefined sparsity parameter ρ are not similar, which is a sparsity phenomenon. L2 regularization term prevents the value of sparsity regularization from being small during the sparse autoencoder training stage. Table 4 shows the settings of sparse autoencoder.

The test dataset was gathered under the normal operation on a summer day (Aug. 15). As shown in Fig. 5 , except for TCCSA of Case 1, all sensor models were developed well with a good accuracy (more than 99.00%). The less accurate SAT developed by the existing supervised modeling approach (Xs to Y) required additional variables in its training to be more accurate. The autoencoder-based sensor models for the two variables are produced accurately by essential variables without extra variables (or physical sensors) required in the existing method. It shows the advance in modeling system variables for an operational system. 5.2 In-situ calibration accuracy for three cases under three error conditions To evaluate the calibration accuracies of three cases for the three error conditions, the residual errors for the two sensors after calibration were compared with each other as shown in Fig. 6. The residual errors were calculated by the difference between the predefined true value and the corrected value by VIC in each case. Even though Case 1 shows reasonable accuracy in error condition 1, the calibration failed in the other conditions due to low accuracy of TCCSA (as mentioned above) and the absence of a model calibration term in the distance formulation as in Eq. (15). It shows the limitation of the existing VIC method. Comparing two different ways in the autoencoder-coupled VIC, Case 3 was much better than Case 2. The calibration of Case 2 totally failed in all error conditions even if the sensor models were accurate as shown in Fig. 5. This was because the calibration problem is formulated only by the air-side relations of AHU and gets underdetermined in estimating the true values under the faulty conditions. On the contrary, the correction constants of Case 3 were almost the same as the true values in all error conditions: The residual temperature and airflow errors were within ±0.2 °C and ±0.05%, respectively. Since Case 3 included the information (chiller power and valve control signal) at the water side, the calibration problem was more informative mathematically to seek the true values. That is, the suggested autoencoder-coupled VIC, as defined in Case 3, can be more determined as if the distance function has both the model and sensor terms, although the previous requirements were not introduced. Therefore, it provides good calibration accuracy for various errors. 5.3 In-situ calibration capability: system energy saving This study applied the in-situ sensor calibration into a system operation to show operational energy saving effect. To quantify the effect, the estimated correction constants for the two sensors by VIC were considered in the fault object of EnergyPlus, as given in Eqs. (14) and (15). As shown in Fig. 7, the three calibration cases of the third error condition (severe), chiller electric power changes were plotted during normal, faulty, and calibrated conditions. First, the increased rates in a chiller electric power is found after introducing the sensor faults (after 10 a.m.). It is the impact of sensor error on the system energy consumption. After the calibration period (11 a.m.\u20131 p.m.), the chiller power was moved back to that of the normal operation (repaired) in Case 3 because of the good calibration performance. In Cases 1 and 2, the power was increased further by the calibration failure. Fig. 8 shows the energy uses for cooling, heating, a fan, and pumps before and after calibration for a month (in August). Due to the sensor error (+2 °C) of TCCSA , the total energy use increased by about 38% showing cooling energy increase of 21%, heating energy increase of 113%, and pump energy increase of 16%. The positive sensor error of TCCSA increased the chiller water flow rate and the cooling operation time to reach the set-point temperature at the point of cooling coil supply air. Then the hot water flow rate and heating operation time were also increased to reduce the cooler supply air until the set-point temperature of supply air was reached. These caused the energy usage increase for cooling, heating, and pumps. The fan energy usage was not changed because the air handling controller maintained the set-point of final supply air temperature regardless of the sensor error. For the energy consumptions derived by the in-situ calibration of Case 3, owing to the increased calibration accuracy, the unnecessary augmented energy usage due to the sensor error could change back to that of a fault-free condition. Such a result shows (1) the considerable impact of sensor errors on building energy usage, (2) the importance of accurate in-situ sensor calibration, and (3) the capabilities of the suggested in-situ calibration in a self-repair function, building energy automation, and saving the operational system energy. 6 Conclusion This paper proposes an advanced in-situ sensor calibration method, named virtual in-situ calibration, in air handling units by coupling Bayesian inference and autoencoder. The calibration problem is formulated by a distance function representing system and sensor uncertainties. The Bayesian inference is intended to statistically estimate the unknown correction variables that cancel out the hidden sensor errors by decreasing the distance function. The autoencoder is used to produce system and sensor models for effective distance formulation without previous requirements and is based on the unsupervised data-driven approach. A three-step strategy to construct the system variables (autoencoder input variables) is also suggested to improve the autoencoder performance in AHU. Finally, the new distance function is defined by the difference between physical variables (e.g., control signals and measurements) and autoencoder-driven variables (modeled values). The autoencoder-driven distance formulation based on this method can produce system models without additional sensors and assumptions, while improving the sensor model accuracy and availability in a given calibration domain (without the extension). Based on these characteristics, the new in-situ calibration method is shown to enhance the calibration performance and applicability by overcoming the practical limitations of existing in-situ calibration methods in AHU. The case study investigated in this paper showed the following: (1) The systematic or offset sensor error increased system energy consumptions significantly; the total energy consumption increases by 38% when there is a +2 °C error of TCCSA . (2) In-situ calibration could eliminate various sensor errors, and thus restore efficient energy performance. (3) Finally, it was very important to construct autoencoder input variables through the suggested three steps, as done in Case 3, in calibrating various sensor errors; for example, the residual errors for the two sensors in Case 3 were within ±0.2 °C and ±0.05%, respectively under all error conditions. The advanced in-situ calibration can be extended to fault detection, diagnosis, and self-repair for faults of various building energy systems and sensors, based on the capability to estimate unknown variables or faulty situations under various system balance principles (inference). In this context, it is important to determine the best local calibration areas and to cover all errors varying depending on operation conditions in operational building energy systems.

        "dc:description": "Sensor errors have a considerable influence on the system operation and energy usage in an air handling unit. Sensor fault detection and diagnosis (SFDD) has been widely studied to handle the impacts of sensor errors on an air-handling unit (AHU). Beyond the SFDD, in-situ calibration can correct the faulty sensor (especially for systematic errors) automatically in field, thereby reducing the energy waste. In this study, we propose an advanced in-situ sensor calibration named virtual in-situ calibration in an operational AHU. The suggested method is intended to overcome the challenges of previous in-situ calibration methods by coupling the Bayesian inference and autoencoder. In a given sensor calibration domain of an AHU, based on the unsupervised learning neural network feature trained to duplicate their input variables, the autoencoder-coupled calibration can produce system and sensor models effectively without additional sensors and assumptions, which are the main limitations of the earlier methods. It improves the calibration performance and applicability in the AHU. In addition, a three-step strategy to construct autoencoder input variables and a new distance function to achieve successful calibration under various faulty conditions is proposed. In a case study, where the error in the cooling coil supply temperature (+2 °C) caused a total energy increase of 38%, the present method is shown to eliminate the sensor error and the energy waste completely. These results show the capabilities and potentials of the suggested method in the self-repair, diagnostics, and automation of a building energy sector.",
