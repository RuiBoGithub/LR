Handling Editor: X Zhao This paper proposes a novel optimal control method for multi-zone HVAC systems to enhance energy efficiency and improve occupant comfort. To address the disturbances in outdoor weather and indoor loads, the proposed method formulates the HVAC control problem as a dynamic Markov decision process, and employs deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques to obtain the optimal control policy. To manage multiple goals among thermal comfort, indoor air quality (IAQ) and system energy efficiency, a preference-inspired (P-ins) mechanism is designed to achieve the optimal balance among different objectives. The P-ins mechanism effectively guides the agent towards the optimal control policy with high convergence rate. The proposed method has been validated through EnergyPlus-Python co-simulation testbed with real-world data traces, and assessed by an overall evaluation indicator. Results demonstrate that the proposed method can reduce energy consumption without compromising thermal comfort and IAQ. Specifically, the occurrence of temperature violations is reduced below 0.8 %, and a maximum energy saving of 9.41 % can be achieved, compared with traditional methods.

Among all building services, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems significantly contribute to the growth of building energy consumption [2,3]. The HVAC systems are primarily responsible for maintaining thermal comfort and IAQ within conditioned spaces, which is closely related to the health and productivity of occupants [4\u20136]. Studies have shown that poor-quality indoor thermal comfort and IAQ conditions could impair work and cognitive performance [7]. In the existing research, many strategies have been proposed to reduce energy consumption considering occupant comfort as well. These strategies can be broadly divided into three kinds [8,9]: rule-based control (RBC) methods, model predictive control (MPC) methods, and reinforcement learning (RL) methods. RBC methods are extensively used in practice, which adopt a set of manual rules designed by professional engineers or facility managers to determine the optimal HVAC setpoints [10,11]. Due to the uncertain outdoor weather and indoor stochastic occupancy, the operating environment of HVAC systems is dynamic and nonstationary [12\u201314]. However, the rules in RBC methods are fixed and lack the flexibility to capture dynamic information. Hence, it is a main challenge to cope with the complex dynamics of HVAC systems in developing HVAC optimal control methods [15]. MPC methods are extensively used to tackle the above problem, requiring an accurate low-order system model and objective function [16,17]. Nevertheless, obtaining a model including building environment structures and HVAC dynamics and converting to low-order or linear is still a complicated process. Although progress has been made in HVAC modeling [18\u201321], a generalized model that applies to different building environments is still not available. Some studies apply MPC to schedule energy usage within buildings based on real-time electricity prices, etc [22,23]. These methods also require a model to predict energy consumption, similarly, leading the challenges in modeling and testing [24,25]. As an alternative, RL approaches pertain particularly to optimization control and decision-making problems with environmental uncertainties [26]. Specifically, as a typical model-free approach, RL can learn an optimal control policy from interaction data with the environment without requiring thermal dynamics [27,28]. Moreover, once an optimal policy has been learned by the agent, it can be rapidly deployed for HVAC control to make end-to-end and real-time optimal decisions without acquiring plentiful system parameters [29,30]. Some researchers adopt deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in HVAC control to improve the comfort of occupants while reducing energy consumption. Li et al. [31] proposed an improved Q-learning algorithm to optimize thermal comfort and energy efficiency in HVAC systems and achieved better performance compared with traditional Q-learning methods. Yoon et al. [32] used a deep Q-network (DQN) for indoor cooling control to minimize system energy consumption while maintaining thermal comfort. Deng et al. [13] proposed nonstationary DQN, which is a novel HVAC control method combining a DQN with active building environment change detection to minimize thermal violations and energy consumption. Liu et al. [33] proposed a novel multi-step predictive deep reinforcement learning algorithm to reduce the energy consumption of the HVAC system while ensuring user satisfaction. The above-mentioned methods primarily consider indoor thermal comfort as the control and optimization indicator. However, IAQ is equally important to evaluate the indoor environmental comfort of occupants [34,35]. In addition, random zone occupancy, uncertain outdoor weather and the heat production of electric equipment should also be considered in a multi-zone office building, as these factors can significantly affect the occupant comfort and system energy consumption. In addition, discretization of the action space may sometimes fail to obtain the optimal strategy due to inappropriate discretization criterion. In addition, balancing thermal comfort, IAQ and energy saving by designing the RL reward function is rather challenging, which requires proper design of each part to reflect the attention level towards each optimization indicator [36]. It is common for building owners/occupants to have different preferences on these design indicators. However, most of the existing studies emphasize the significance of each factor by simply predefining the weighting parameters. The predefined weights lack universality and may result in poor performance, low reliability and high unnecessary costs. Besides, it fails to trade-off among the demands of different users when disagreement exists. To tackle the above problems, this paper proposes a novel optimal control method for HVAC systems that optimizes energy efficiency and occupant comfort. The HVAC control problem is formulated as a Markov decision process in dynamic environments, and the P-ins DRL method of continuous action space is proposed to optimize the HVAC operation. The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows. a) This paper investigates the optimal control of multi-zone HVAC under dynamic factors like random outdoor weather and time-varying indoor thermal environment parameters, which is more in line with reality. b) A preference-inspired (P-ins) DRL mechanism is devised, which guides the DRL agent to obtain the optimal control policy towards low energy consumption without sacrificing occupant comfort. c) The proposed P-ins DRL method has been validated by real world trace-based testing, which can achieve satisfactory indoor comfort with lower energy consumption in all test cases. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The key sub-models of the HVAC system and control objectives are mathematically formulated in Section 2. Then, a real-time HVAC control method based on the performance-inspired mechanism and RL algorithm is proposed in Section 3. In Section 4, the experimental simulation setup and parameter settings are introduced. In Section 5, results are presented and discussed. Finally, Section 6 draws conclusions. 2 Problem description 2.1 Introduction of HVAC system Fig. 1 shows a typical N-zone HVAC system, which mainly consists of air handling units (commonly called AHUs), supply/return fans, and terminal device sensors. These components are introduced in the following: a) AHUs: The AHU is used to filter and control the supply air to guarantee the quality and temperature/humidity requirement. The air designated to each zone shares the same temperature and fresh air ratio. The AHU mainly consists of heating/cooling coils and supply/return fans. b) Cooling/Heating coils: The cooling/heating coils can heat or cool the mixed air to meet the supply air temperature demand. c) Supply/return fans: The supply fan is used to pump the treated air to each zone. The return fan is used to ensure the proper volume of air can return from each zone to balance the amount of air supplied to and exhausted from the conditioned space. d) Dampers: The dampers in AHU control the proportion of fresh air and return air, i.e., the fresh air ratio. Fresh outdoor air can be mixed proportionally with the return air to meet the air quality requirements of each zone. e) Terminal devices: The VAV box is the most commonly used terminal device, which is used to regulate the supply airflow rate pulling into each zone. f) Sensors: The HVAC system consists of various sensors including temperature sensors, CO2 sensors, power/electricity meters, etc. These sensors can collect relevant data in the indoor environment and upload it to the control center. 2.2 The dynamics of HVAC systems and key control variables This section investigates the key dynamic models involved in energy saving and occupant comfort problems, and identifies the crucial control variables required to attain the desired objectives. 2.2.1 Modeling of indoor thermal dynamics Indoor thermal comfort depends on many factors, such as indoor temperature, relative humidity, average radiant temperature, airflow rate and speed, clothing insulation, the metabolic rate of the human body, etc., which make terminal dynamics very complicated. For the sake of simplicity, temperature is usually adopted as the indicator to measure thermal comfort [37,38]. Let T i,t denotes the indoor temperature of zone i at time step t, and T i,t should be controlled within the required range: (1) T i min ≤ T i , t ≤ T i max , ∀ i ∈ N , t > 0 where T i min and T i max are the minimum and maximum values of the indoor temperature control range respectively. N is the number of conditioned zones. The variations in the indoor thermal environment are primarily associated with temperature changes. The indoor temperature is closely related to the heat transfer from adjacent zones, outdoor environmental heat exchange, heat/cold airflow introduced by the HVAC system, and internal heat gained from human bodies and indoor equipment. Then, the thermal dynamic of zone i can be modeled by Eq. (2) [39]: (2) T i , t + 1 − T i , t = ( ∑ j = 1 N j U w a l l A w a l l , j ( T o u t , t − T i , t ) ⏟ Q i , t w a l l + ∑ p = 1 N p U w i n A w i n , p ( T o u t , t − T i , t ) ⏟ Q i , t w i n + ∑ p = 1 N p β w i n , p A w i n , p I t s o l , p ⏟ Q i , t s o l + ∑ s = 1 N s U w a l l A w a l l , s ( T s , t − T i , t ) + ∑ h = 1 N h U w i n A w i n , h ( T h , t − T i , t ) ⏟ Q i , t a d j + ρ C ρ m i , t ( 1 − q l ) ( T c − T i , t ) ⏟ Q i , t v e n + P e r t b B o d y p e r A i B o d y s + P e r t a E l e c p e r A i ε e l e c ⏟ Q i , t i n ) Δ t / ρ C ρ V i where Q i,t wall is the heat exchanges with the outdoor environment through the external walls at time step t, N j is the number of external walls in zone i. Q i,t win is the heat exchange through the windows, and N p is the number of external windows. Q i,t adj denotes the heat exchanges with adjacent zones, N s , N h is the number of zones adjacent through walls and windows, respectively. Q i,t ven is the heat or cold airflow generated from the HVAC system at time step t, which is associated with airflow volume, and indoor and outdoor temperature difference, as shown in the fourth term. Q i,t in is the internal heat gain at time step t, which is associated with the hourly occupancy rate, the hourly utilization rate of appliances, heat emission of human bodies and heat density of appliances [40,41]. T out,t is the outdoor air temperature at time step t, T c is the setting supply air temperature of AHU. ρ is the air density and Cρ is the special heat capacity. V i is the volume of the zone i. q l represents the air leakage rate of the HVAC system. In Eq. (2), the supply airflow rate for each zone m i,t can be adjusted by the damper in VAV box in each conditioned zone. There have: (3) m i min ≤ m i , t ≤ m i max , ∀ i ∈ N , t > 0 where m i min and m i max are the minimum and maximum supply airflow rate of zone i, respectively. For multi-zone HVAC systems in buildings, when the supply air temperature setpoint T c is fixed, the indoor temperature can be controlled and maintained in a comfortable range by regulating the supply airflow rate m i,t . 2.2.2 Modeling of indoor air quality As for indoor air quality (IAQ), the indoor CO2 level, which is one of the typical indoor pollutants, typically serves as the indicator for IAQ [42]. A high level of CO2 can seriously degrade the IAQ, which is also harmful to occupant health and working efficiency. Hence, the indoor CO2 concentration O i,t in zone i at time step t should be limited below a prescribed level [43]: (4) O i , t ≤ O i max , ∀ i ∈ N , t > 0 where O i max is the threshold of the indoor CO2 concentration. The indoor CO2 concentration is influenced by various factors such as the supplied airflow rate from the HVAC system, outdoor CO2 level and CO2 generated by indoor occupants. The dynamic model of the CO2 concentration in zone i at time step t can be described as: (5) O i , t + 1 − O i , t = ( m i , t ( 1 − q l ) ( O m i x , t − O i , t ) + K i , t G g , t ⋅ 10 6 ) Δ t / ρ V i where O i,t+1 is the concentration at the next time step t+1. K i,t is the number of occupants in zone i at time step t. G g,t is the CO2 generation rate per capita, which is determined by the number of the occupants in zone and their activities [44]. The CO2 generated by an occupant at time step t can be informed by: (6) G g , t = 9.936 ⋅ D ⋅ R Q ⋅ M E T t ( 0.23 ⋅ R Q + 0.77 ) ⋅ 10 3 where D is the DuBois surface, RQ is the respiratory quotients. Normally, D equals 1.8 and RQ equals 0.83 [45]. MET t is the metabolic equivalent of the task at time step t. O mix,t is the CO2 concentration of the mixed air in ppm at time step t, which can be expressed by: (7) O m i x , t = d t O o u t , t + ( 1 − d t ) ∑ i ∈ N m i , t O i , t ∑ i ∈ N m i , t The O out,t is the outdoor CO2 concentration at time step t. Eqs. (5)\u2013(7) indicate that a higher CO2 concentration level is associated with inadequate fresh air intake. The fresh air ratio (denoted as d t ) of the supply air can be adjusted by the damper in the AHU. There have: (8) 0 ≤ d t ≤ d max , ∀ t > 0 where d max is the maximum value of the fresh air ratio in the AHU. Taking the above analysis into consideration, the IAQ can be controlled and optimized by adjusting the supply airflow rate in each zone m i,t and the fresh air ratio d t . 2.2.3 Modeling of HVAC energy consumption The energy consumption of the HVAC system primarily originates from two sources: the energy consumed by the AHU and chiller for air treatment (cooling), and the energy use associated with the supply fan for delivering the treated airflow to each conditioned zone [46,47]. Therefore, the cooling energy P cooling,t can be modeled by: (9) P c o o l i n g , t = C ρ d t ∑ i ∈ N m i , t ( T o u t , t − T c ) + C ρ ( 1 − d t ) ∑ i ∈ N m i , t ( T i , t − T c ) η C O P where η is the efficiency factor of the cooling coil, and COP is the coefficient of cooling performance related to the chiller. For the delivering cooled air of the supply fan, the fan energy consumption P fan,t at time step t is given by: (10) P f a n , t = P r e f , t ( ∑ i ∈ N m i , t m r e f ) 3 Δ t where P ref,t is the power of the reference fan at nominal state, m ref is the total supply airflow rate pumped by reference fans. According to Eqs. (9)\u2013(10), the fan energy consumption is closely related to the supply airflow rate m i,t in each zone, while the cooling energy consumption is primarily affected by both m i,t and the fresh air ratio d t . In conclusion, for the controllable variables within the HVAC systems, such as supply airflow rate m i,t and the fresh air ratio d t , selecting appropriate action values at each time step to operate the HVAC systems allows for minimization of energy consumption without scarifying thermal comfort or indoor air quality. 2.3 The objectives of multi-zone HVAC system optimization The HVAC system should be efficiently operated to achieve a satisfactory indoor environment with comfortable temperature and CO2 levels while reducing the power consumed. Specifically, the objective is to minimize the total intra-day energy consumption by adjusting the control variables m i,t and d t , constrained by indoor thermal comfort and IAQ requirements. The problem is a constrained multi-objective optimization problem, as described in Eq. (11), which is graphically illustrated in Fig. 2 : (11) F t o t a l = min m i , t , d t ∑ t = 1 L E { P c o o l i n g , t + P f a n , t } s . t . { m i min ≤ m i , t ≤ m i max 0 ≤ d t ≤ d max T i min ≤ T i , t ≤ T i max O i , t ≤ O i max where E is the expectation operator, and L is the number of time steps for a control period. However, solving the multi-objective control problem represented by Eq. (11) is particularly challenging due to the following reasons. Firstly, due to the complexity and uncertainty of the environment, it is challenging to accurately model the true thermodynamics of T i,t . The aforementioned formulas of Eq. (2) are simplified representations. Secondly, for precise control, unpredictable environmental parameters such as outdoor temperature, occupancy levels and equipment usage in different zones should be considered during the control process. Additionally, indoor temperature (T i,t ) and CO2 concentration (O i,t ) are subject to temporal and spatial coupling constraints in the control process, easily influencing each other. Therefore, a proper balance between thermal comfort and IAQ is required. Moreover, the objective function of this control problem exhibits non-convex and non-separable characteristics, involving a large number of variables, resulting in a vast solution space at each time step. 3 The proposed P-ins DRL method To solve the above challenges, a novel DRL-based optimal control method is developed for HVAC systems, named the P-ins DRL method. The architecture of the P-ins DRL method will be introduced first. Then, the P-ins mechanism is devised and the specific DRL approach will be elaborated in detail. 3.1 Architecture of the proposed P-ins DRL method According to the dynamic models presented in Section 2.2, the control problem can be formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP) problem [48], which can be solved by DRL approaches. The MDP can be represented in the form of < S , A , R > , where S represents the state space, A expresses the action space, and R: S × A → R denotes the reward of the agent obtained, which can evaluate the quality of actions taken by the current agent, assisting the agent in learning policy that obtains higher rewards [49,50]. The architecture of the proposed P-ins DRL method is shown in Fig. 3 . First, the agent observes the environment state s through sensors deployed in zones. Then, the agent acts the action an under the current control policy π. The environment responds to this action a and is transferred to next state s\u2032, while calculating a reward r to return to the agent. The above-described interaction between the environment and the agent, can be described by state-action transitions as < s , a , r , s \u2032 > . Through continuous interactions, the agent can improve the control policy, thereby learning the optimal control policy π*. 3.2 The P-ins mechanism for multi-objective control The reward function is the signal that guides the agent's learning process and affects the convergence rate and the agent's behavior. Therefore, the design of the reward function is crucial in multi-objective control tasks, as it pertains to balancing multiple objectives and achieving effective control. The fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP) is an effective method for assessing the importance of various indicators in multi-criteria problems to assist decision-making, which employs quantitative weight values to define the relative importance among different indicators [51\u201353]. Inspired by this, this paper defines a Preference-Inspired (P-ins) mechanism, to guide the design of reward functions in addressing multi-objective control problems. The calculation of the importance weights for each objective factor involves four steps, which are illustrated in Fig. 4 . Firstly, the objective factors to be considered in the reward function are selected from the multi-objective problems. Assuming there are k objective factors, the set of objective factors can be represented as u = {f 1 , f 2 , \u2026, f k }. Secondly, a fuzzy judgment matrix A = (a ij ) k×k needs to be defined to quantify the relative importance of one objective factor compared to another. This matrix should satisfy the following characteristics: (12) a i j = 0.5 , a i j + a j i = 1 , ∀ i , j = 1 , 2 , . . . , k where a ij represents the relative importance of f i to f j that can be quantitatively described by a 9-level scale from 0.1 to 0.9. The larger the value, the higher the relative importance, and the greater the preference. Using this quantitative evaluation method, one can compare the importance of evaluation factors in pairs to obtain the judgment matrix A. Generally, matrix A is pre-defined based on the individual needs or preferences of different users/groups. Thirdly, according to the fuzzy judgment matrix A, the importance weights of each objective factor can be expressed: (13) W * = ( w 1 , w 2 , . . . , w k ) (14) w i = ∑ j = 1 k a i j + n 2 − 1 n ( n − 1 ) , ∀ i = 1 , 2 , . . . , k (15) ∑ i = 1 3 w i = 1 , w i ≥ 0 where W* represents the vector of the importance weights for the set of u, and w i represents the ith element in vector W*. Then, the feature matrix W of the fuzzy judgment matrix can be obtained: (16) W = ( w i j ) k × k , w i j = w i w i + w j , ∀ i , j = 1 , 2 , . . . , k Finally, consistency checking is needed to determine whether the currently obtained important weights W* are reasonable. The indicator named consistency ratio (CR) of matrices A and W as: (17) I ( A , W ) = 1 k 2 ∑ i = 1 k ∑ j = 1 k | a i j + w i j − 1 | Assuming the required consistency ratio is I(A,W) < υ, which usually needs to be less than 0.1. If the consistency derivation is too large, indicating the selected weight vector is unreliable as a decision-making basis, the rationality of matrix A should be reconsidered. For practical problems, it often obtains more than one fuzzy judgment matrix, stemming from different evaluative perspectives, e.g., users within the building tend to emphasize comfort, while designers may prioritize HVAC energy consumption. Assuming there are m fuzzy judgment matrices A 1 , \u2026A m , provided for the same set of objective factors u, the overall weight calculation process mainly consists of four major parts: 1) Following the calculation method given above (represented by ℓ(.)) to obtain the feature matrices W 1 , \u2026W m for the fuzzy judgment matrices A 1 , \u2026A m .: (18) W i = l ( A i ) , ∀ i = 1 , . . . , m 2) Conducting the consistency checking for each fuzzy judgment matrix: (19) I ( A i , W i ) ≤ υ , ∀ i = 1 , . . . , m 3) Particularly, it is necessary to conduct the compatibility checking between the different fuzzy judgment matrices: (20) I ( A x , A y ) = 1 k 2 ∑ i = 1 k ∑ j = 1 k | a i j x + a i j y − 1 | ≤ χ , ∀ x , y = 1 , . . . , m , x ≠ y where χ is the acceptance level to evaluate the compatibility degree between different fuzzy judgment matrices. 4) When both 2) and 3) are satisfied simultaneously, it is reasonable and reliable to use the m fuzzy judgment matrices to calculate importance weights for the set of u. There are: (21) W u * = ( w 1 u , . . . , w k u ) w i u = 1 m ∑ j = 1 m w i j , ∀ i = 1 , 2 , . . . , k where W u * represents the vector of the importance weights for the set of u. and w i u represents the ith element in vector W u *. w i j is the ith element in the vector W j *, which denotes the importance weight from the fuzzy judge matrix A j . The obtained weights integrate the suggestions of multiple participants, making the design of control objectives more in line with human personalized needs, achieving better balance in multi-objective problems, and providing a design template that can be used as a reference. 3.3 Reformulation of the optimal control problem 3.3.1 State-space formulation According to the analysis in Section 2.2, variables related to indoor temperature and CO2 are selected as part of the state s. In addition, the operational status of the HVAC system and the energy power are also observed. Hence, the state s ∈ S at time step t is designed as: (23) s t = { T t , T o u t , t , O t , O o u t , t , E t , K t , P t , m t , d t } where T t , O t , E t and K t are the vectors containing a set of values of the indoor temperature, the CO2 concentration, the total power of electrical equipment and the number of occupants at time step t in each zone. P t is the HVAC power designed by P t = P fan,t + P cooling,t . And m t also is a vector that denotes set values of the airflow rate in each zone. 3.3.2 Action-space formulation Based on the sub-models in Section 2.2, the action includes a vector that represents the change in airflow rate Δm t from the system to each zone and the change in fresh air ratio Δd t in the AHU. The action is designed as increment value, to enhance the universality of the method. Thus, the action a∈A of the agent at time step t can be written as: (24) a t = { Δ m t , Δ d t } 3.3.3 P-ins-based reward function design To minimize the HVAC energy consumption while maintaining comfortable temperature and CO2 concentration level in all zones, the reward function for a specific agent is designed in three parts, i.e., the penalty for indoor temperature violation r i,t,T , the penalty for indoor CO2 concentration violation r i,t,O , and the penalty for the energy consumption of the supply fan and cooling r t,P . For zone i, the first part r i,t,T is a piecewise function, given by: (25) r i , t , T = { c 1 , T i min − T t h ≤ T i , t ≤ T i max + T t h c 2 ( [ T i , t − T i max ] + + [ T i min − T i , t ] + ) , e l s e where T th is a threshold with a small value. The temperature violation is not counted if the magnitude of the violation is smaller than T th . Due to the presence of the dead zone in the temperature sensor, maintaining the indoor temperature at an exact setpoint is not always possible. The threshold allows for some small deviations of the indoor temperature. Similarly, the second part r i,t,O is given by: (26) r i , t , O = { c 3 , O i max ≥ O i , t c 4 ( O i , t − O i max ) , e l s e Then, the third part r t,P penalizing P coil,t and P fan,t is given by: (27) r t , P = c 5 ( P c o o l i n g , t + P f a n , t ) In Eqs. (25)\u2013(27), c 1, c 3 > 0 gives reward for meeting the control requirements, and c 2, c 4, c 5 < 0 denotes penalty factors for the temperature/CO2 violation and energy consumption. Taking the three parts into consideration, the reward function is designed as follows: (28) r t = λ T ∑ i = 1 N α i r i , t , T + λ O ∑ i = 1 N β i r i , t , O + λ P ∑ i = 1 N r t , P where λ T , λ O and λ P denote the importance weights reflecting the overall preference for different objectives, and α i and β i are the preference degrees of different objectives in zone i. Values of these parameters can be obtained by the P-ins mechanism in Section 3.2. 3.4 Continuous TD3-based optimal control algorithm The value function is used to evaluate the quality of the policy π. The value of acting a at state s is denoted by Ref. [54]: (29) Q π ( s , a ) = E π [ ∑ j = 0 T γ j r t + j | s t = s , a t = a ] where γ is the discount factor for the future rewards, and 0 < γ < 1 [55]. The policy gradient is frequently utilized for complex control problems with large and continuous action space to obtain the optimal policy, which parameterizes the policy π to π(s|φ), where φ is the parameter of the neural network. The deterministic policy is defined as a = μ(s|φ), and sets the policy objective function J(φ) to evaluate the parameterized policy. According to the policy gradient theorem, the deterministic policy gradient is denoted by: (30) ∇ φ J ( φ ) = E s , a ∼ μ [ ∇ φ μ ( s | a ) ∇ a Q μ ( s , a ) | a = μ ( s | φ ) ] When calculating the gradient, the real state-action value function Q is required, which is unfortunately unknown. The critic network in the actor-critic (AC) structure is used to fit the actual Q function [56], and the actor network is used to fit the policy. The structure relies on a neural network and is updated using the time difference error (TD error) δ t method: (31) δ t = r t + γ Q ( s t + 1 , a t + 1 | θ ) − Q ( s t , a t | θ ) where θ is the parameter of the critic network, whose updated formula is: (32) θ ← θ + τ δ t ∇ θ Q ( s t , a t | θ ) where τ is the learning rate of the critic network. The learned value function Q(s, a|θ) is substituted for the actual value function Q(s, a), and inserted into the policy gradient formula Eq. (30) to update the policy. Considering the problem formulated in this study, there are two points to note here: a) In practice, the HVAC systems are continuous systems, where the state and action space are continuous and high-dimensional. b) Uncertainty exists in external weather, internal loads as well as occupancy, resulting in a highly dynamic and non-smooth environment inside and outside the building, which can cause instability in the convergence of the DRL approach. Twins delay deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) [57] can be used to solve continuous control problems with high stability in a dynamic and uncertain environment. The architecture of TD3 is depicted in the RHS block of Fig. 3, which is the extension of the AC structure. As shown, TD3 includes 6 neural networks, and the critic networks share the same construction with the actor networks. Detailed explanations are given as follows: 1) Dual critic function In the actor-critic framework, the critic function is also named the action value function Q(s, π(s)), representing the expected reward value when the actor takes action a at state s in the policy π. The actor network is used to approximate the policy π with the parameter φ. In TD3, two critic networks are used each with a corresponding target critic network. Hence, two Q-value networks y 1 and y 2 are established to compute the value of the next state s': (33) { y 1 = r + γ Q θ 1 \u2032 ( s \u2032 , π φ \u2032 ( s \u2032 ) ) y 2 = r + γ Q θ 2 \u2032 ( s \u2032 , π φ \u2032 ( s \u2032 ) ) where r is the reward of the current time step. θ 1 ' and θ 2 ' are the parameters of target critic networks. φ\u2032 is the parameter of the target actor network (denoted as \u2018Critic network 2\u2019 in Fig. 3). The clipped minimum of the two values is selected as the target Q-value y to offset the overestimation of the Q-value and is then substituted into the Bellman equation to calculate TD-error and loss function L(.) as follows: (34) y = r + γ min i = 1 , 2 Q θ i \u2032 ( s \u2032 , π φ \u2032 ( s \u2032 ) ) L ( θ i ) = E [ ( y − Q θ i ( s , a ) i = 1 , 2 2 ] where L(θ i ) is the loss function of θ i . 2) Target policy smoothing regularization To address the overfitting problem caused by estimation bias and variance in deterministic policy methods with narrow estimation peaks, the Q-value evaluation should be smoothed to balance estimation bias and variance. Clipped normal distribution noise is added to the target actor network's output actions for regularization, as follows: (35) a = π φ \u2032 ( s \u2032 ) + ε 2 , ε 2 ∼ clip ( N ( 0 , σ 2 ) , − c , c ) , ∀ c > 0 where ε 2 represents random noise added to the actions. σ is the standard variation of Gaussian distribution and c is the clipped value to ensure that the output value of the target policy network is within a special range. 3) Delayed policy update For actor/policy networks, the updating of the parameter φ is to maximize the expectation of the cumulative reward. The policy network is updated by gradient descent: (36) ∇ φ J ( φ ) = ∂ J π ( φ ) ∂ φ = E [ ∇ a Q θ 1 ( s , a ) | a = π φ ( s ) ∇ φ π φ ( s ) ] where ∇ φ J(φ) is the gradient of the target function J(φ) in terms of φ. ∇ a Q θ1 (s, a) is the gradient of the Q value in terms of a. ∇ φ π φ (s) is the gradient of the policy π in terms of φ. The critic networks guide the updating of the actor network. As a result, the update frequency of the critic network can be tuned higher than that of the actor network. Lower policy update frequency reduces the variance of Q function and allows for higher-quality policy. The delayed frequency d could be flexibly adjusted according to situations. Therefore, for every d time steps, the parameters θ i ' and φ\u2032 of target networks are updated through soft updating: (37) θ i \u2032 ← τ 1 θ i \u2032 + ( 1 − τ 1 ) θ i , i = 1 , 2 φ \u2032 ← τ 2 φ \u2032 + ( 1 − τ 2 ) φ where the actor network and critic networks have different learning rates with τ 1 and τ 2. During the control process, the TD3 agent interacts with the environment and stores < s, a, r, s\u2032> in the Replay Buffer Ɗ. The agent samples from Ɗ and evaluates the action's value using two critic functions. The minimum one is taken to update the parameters in two critic networks according to the target critic function with regulation. The actor/policy network updates are delayed than critic networks to reduce the update frequency. Finally, all the target networks are updated from the current networks by way of soft updates. The pseudocode of the training process is given in Algorithm 1, and the validation procedure of the proposed P-ins DRL method is given in Algorithm 2. Image 1 Image 2 4 Experimental simulation setup 4.1 Experimental simulation environment Fig. 5 shows the whole operational structure of the designed co-simulation testbed. The simulation environment is deployed in EnergyPlus by the OpenAI Gym interface, to simulate the real-time interactive indoor/outdoor environment in a multi-zone building equipped with HVAC systems. The geometry of the building is created in SketchUp, defined in OpenStudio, and visualized in 3D view. The proposed P-ins DRL method is implemented in Python scripts and applied to the testbed through an application programming interface (API), which serves as a connector for different simulation programs to run the co-simulation. During the simulation run, input definition files and data exchange files are used to create EnergyPlus instances. An input definition file specifies the physical characteristics of the building, HVAC system, and simulation settings, and a data exchange file specifies the observation and control variables for the agent. For data exchange, the agent controls and manipulates variables through Python scripts. Additionally, code will be written to transform raw observation data into the agent's states and reward information. To enable data transfer between Python and EnergyPlus, the simulation project was wrapped into a Functional Mock-up Unit (FMU) model using the Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) standard with an External Interface component. Then, this paper uses PyFMI 2.9.8 to load FMU models, exchange data, and translate FMU models into a simulation runtime environment accessible to the agent. The computation was performed on an Intel(R) Xeon(R) W-2145 processor with 32 GB RAM and an NVIDIA Quadro P2000 GPU. In Fig. 5, the main part of the OpenAI gym interface is a Python object with three functions: variable constructor (init), simulate startup (reset) and action execution (step(a)). The co-simulation testbed running procedures are given below: 1) Execute the initialization function(init) within the Gym interface to create variables used for data communication between different programs. 2) When the agent begins interacting with the simulation environment, the function reset is called by the RL agent. EnergyPlus generates two files initially, which are an input definition file and a data exchange file. Then, when the agent executes reset, it will read these two files to create an instance of EnergyPlus. 3) The EnergyPlus External Interface connects to Gym objects via FMU to establish data communication. The Gym object reads the initial simulation outputs from the EnergyPlus instance. These outputs serve as the initial state variables required for training the agent. 4) Then, the agent calls the step function at each control time step. The Gym interface sends the action a to the EnergyPlus instance via FMU and reads the simulation outputs generated in the next time step. This study focuses on a single-story office building with 5 conditioned zones, served by a HVAC system in summer conditions. The HVAC system consists of a chilled water system, an AHU with a cooling coil, a supply fan, 5 VAV boxes, and return air devices, whose structure is roughly shown in Fig. 1. In the simulation scenario, the HVAC system operates from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m., Monday to Sunday. One day of the 12-h horizon is defined as a training episode, and the simulation interval in each time step is 15 minites. July's data was used for training (i.e., 4 × 12 × 31 = 1488 simulation time steps), and the validation process The validation process was randomly selected from 31 days in August (4 × 12 × 14 = 672) in the simulation period. For the multi-zone control problem, the number of training episodes is set to 210. The first 40 episodes are used for random interactions, during which the agent will not be trained to ensure the exploration. The number of occupants, electric equipment, and lighting power follow a time-varying schedule and are set differently among zones. The weather data is obtained from the open-source EnergyPlus Weather Data. 4.2 Hyperparameters settings This section introduces the hyperparameters involved in the P-ins DRL method. Meanwhile, the importance weights for each objective factor in the reward function calculated by the P-ins mechanism are also listed in Table 1 . The Adam optimizer is utilized in neural network parameter optimization, and ReLU is chosen as the activate function. The discount factor γ is set to 0.99, the Replay Buffer size M is 105 and the mini-batch size B is 128. σ is the exploration parameter that decays from 0.1 to 0 over time, to balance exploration and utilization during training. The delayed policy updating d is set to 3 after repeated experiments. In addition, the importance weight coefficients of reward functions λ T , λ O and λ P are designed as 0.38, 0.3 and 0.32, respectively. The outdoor CO2 concentration is fixed at 418 ppm, and the supply air temperature is fixed at 10 °C. The number of control time steps for an episode is set to 48. Importantly, in this study, the airflow rate in each zone and the fresh air ratio are selected as the action variables. During the experimental simulation, the supply air temperature was set to a suitable fixed value with lower energy consumption, to better demonstrate the control performance, reduce the action space, and achieve rapid stabilization of the control process [58]. The specific parameter settings are shown in Table 1. 5 Experimental simulation results In this section, the proposed P-ins DRL method is tested on the co-simulation testbed described in Section 4. The performance of the proposed method is assessed and compared with two baseline methods in terms of comfort performance and energy saving, under different test scenarios. Besides, the methods are also quantitatively evaluated via designing an overall evaluation indicator S metric . 5.1 Experimental settings Tests were performed in a typical office building in the Florida region, under summer conditions. The building is divided into 5 zones, including an open office, a closed office, a conference zone, a storage zone and a print zone. Fig. 6 provides the minute outdoor temperature data in the training process and validation process. The occupancy, light and equipment schedules are specified for each zone daily. which is unique for each zone and demonstrates the stochastic feature of occupant behaviors. Sample schedules of representative zones are presented in Fig. 7 to illustrate the trends and variations. Based on the above settings, two test scenarios are designed in this study to run the three comparison methods to evaluate performance. a) B1 method: This method is a rule-based method with configurable temperature setpoints such as T i min and T i max , adopting ON/OFF policy for indoor temperature control [59,60]. To be specific, m i,t = m i max if T i,t > T i max ; m i,t = m i min if T i,t < T i min at each time step t. For T i min < T i,t < T i max , m i,t is not changed. Besides, the AHU damper that adjusts the fresh air ratio d t is fixed at a certain position to maintain IAQ during the test period. b) B2 method: This method is the ordinary TD3-based DRL control policy without the P-ins mechanism [61,62]. To be specific, The TD3 agent learns a feasible control policy to adjust the fresh air ratio d t and supply airflow rate m i,t in each zone, by observing the dynamic information (such as T out,t , K i,t , P i,t , etc.) from the environment. c) P-ins DRL method: The P-ins DRL method is the proposed method in Section 3, which deploys the reward weights calculated by the P-ins mechanism to improve the performance of learned policy in multi-objective optimization tasks. Besides, two test scenarios are designed in this paper to compare the above methods. The settings remain consistent in both test scenarios, with only the control objectives being different. Test 1: The target temperature range is set to 22 °C ± 1 °C for all zones, and the CO2 concentration upper limit is set to 800 ppm (22 °C is recommended for productive work [63], and smaller temperature fluctuation is preferred to ensure comfort. Indoor CO2 concentration below 800 ppm indicates excellent IAQ [64,65].). Test 2: The target temperature range is set to 21 °C ± 3 °C for Zone 4, and 22 °C ± 1 °C for the other zones, since Zone 4 is mostly unoccupied and the thermal comfort requirement is not high. Most standards recommend that the indoor CO2 concentration should not be higher than 1000 ppm [66,67], a higher threshold contributes to better energy savings. 5.2 Convergence performance of the P-ins DRL method In Fig. 8 , the rewards and average rewards for the first 100 episodes are relatively low, with occasional downward trends. However, this is because the initial 50 episodes involve random interactions. Subsequent interactions optimize the control parameters, and the rewards start to increase as the agent learns an effective control policy. At this point, the exploration noise gradually decreases, and the agent transitions from exploration towards exploitation, and quickly converges to higher reward values and maintains stability. 5.3 Comfort performance evaluation 5.3.1 Experimental simulation results of Test 1 Tests were conducted over 14 days in the summer period. Fig. 9 and Fig. 10 show the test results on a particular day. Fig. 9 captures the indoor temperature in the five zones by applying different methods, during the working hours 8:00\u201320:00. The solid line in Fig. 9(a) denotes the change of indoor temperature under natural ventilation, i.e., without HVAC. In Fig. 9(b-f), the red solid line shows the temperature profile when the HVAC system is controlled by the proposed P-ins DRL method. The blue solid line and green solid line show the temperature profile by two baseline methods, respectively. It can be also found that the heat generation of indoor electrical equipment is an important factor affecting indoor temperature changes. As shown in Fig. 9(f), the trend of electrical power is similar to the trajectory of temperature, and hence is a key factor that affects the indoor temperature. On the other hand, the temperature traces of Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3 show no apparent difference under natural ventilation conditions under substantially different occupancy. As can be seen from Fig. 9(a), the indoor temperature far exceeds the required value without mechanical ventilation. By applying HVAC control methods, the room temperature can be effectively cooled down. Among the three methods, a control delay always exists in the B1 method, making it unable to respond to the cooling load promptly, leading to temperature fluctuations around the upper limit greatly, and a higher possibility of temperature violations. As for the B2 method, it can comply with the temperature requirement under most circumstances. However, it can cause overcooling and keep the temperature in a lower area, resulting in unnecessary energy dissipation. For the proposed P-ins DRL method, it can maintain the required temperature without over-cooling, achieving a better balance between thermal comfort and energy consumption. Fig. 10 depicts the indoor CO2 concentration under different test methods. The solid line in Fig. 10(a) denotes the change in indoor CO2 concentration without HVAC. Under the B1 method, the CO2 concentration can be strictly controlled for the changing occupancy. However, satisfactory CO2 levels come at the expense of energy consumption. This is because the indoor temperature and CO2 are inherently coupled, whereas the B1 method calculates the ventilation demand based solely on the temperature loop and is unable to respond promptly to the change in CO2, the supply air with the extremely high fresh air ratio leading to sacrifice in the control objective of energy. As for B2 method, it demonstrates a rather good performance with no CO2 violation. However, the indoor temperature is over-cooled, which inevitably requires more energy. In comparison, the P-ins DRL method regulates zone ventilation as well as the fresh air ratio, considering outdoor temperature, zone usage and occupancy, achieving lower CO2 violation frequency with less energy use. It shows that the agent has made a better balance between the IAQ and power consumption to obtain a high reward. In conclusion, the proposed P-ins DRL method demonstrates better performance over two test baseline methods, in controlling indoor temperature and CO2 level. Besides, the P-ins mechanism allows optimization preference in unfavorable zones, which mitigates unbalance among zone goals to a large extent. Fig. 11 shows violations of indoor temperature by different control methods over 14 test days, and no CO2 violation occurred in the validation period. In the test, every 15 min is defined as an episode, which generates 672 episodes in total for 14 test days. During each episode/day, exceedance of temperature setpoints in any of the zones is considered a violation. Fig. 11(a) shows the temperature violation in each test episode, where the dot lines denote the average violation value of 5 zones, and the shadow boundaries denote the maximum and minimum violation values. To present the results statistically, Fig. 11(b) depicts the frequency of occurrence of temperature violations over 14 test days. It can be found that in Table 2 , violations are likely to occur using B1 method, where the temperature violation rate is as high as 38.33 % daily. The B2 method can maintain indoor CO2, while failing to control the room temperature in some cases. In comparison, the proposed P-ins DRL method rarely has violation cases, indicating good control performance in both the thermal environment and IAQ. 5.3.2 Experimental simulation results of Test 2 To verify the performance of the proposed method under different requirements, experimental simulations were repeated in Test 2. In this test scenario, temperature requirements are different for each zone and the CO2 threshold criteria are relatively less strict, which increases the control difficulty of balancing. As shown in the temperature profile depicted in Fig. 12 , the B1 method exhibits significant temperature fluctuations throughout the day, and a considerable large violation during nights, indicating an inability to swiftly respond to indoor and outdoor load variations. In contrast, for the other two methods, namely the B2 and the proposed method, the temperature fluctuations tend to remain consistent most of the time and well-tracked the indoor load trajectory. This suggests that the RL approach has effectively learned how to adapt to dynamic environmental changes. When assessing the practical control performance of the two methods, the B2 method generally meets the temperature control requirements, but occasionally exhibits minor temperature violations. Hence, it may result in localized overcooling, leading to unnecessary energy consumption. As for the proposed P-ins DRL method, it consistently maintains temperature within the comfort range across all zones, achieving a balance between thermal comfort and energy efficiency. Fig. 13 shows the concentration profile of 5 zones by different control methods in Test 2. An overall trend shifting upward can be observed, compared to Test 1. Notably, there were no occurrences of violations, and all three methods successfully maintained CO2 within the appropriate range. Evidently, the proposed method avoids driving the indoor CO2 to excessively low levels, thereby saving energy associated with the increased fresh air volume handled by the AHU. Similarly, Test 2 is also conducted over 14 days. The results are given in Fig. 14 and summarized in Table 3 . It can be observed that B1 method is likely to lead to violations, with a daily temperature violation rate as high as 18.98 %, and a violation value exceeding approximately 1 °C. On the other hand, the B2 method can generally keep CO2 levels within a safe range throughout the day, but it may struggle to effectively control room temperature during certain periods, with a failure probability of around 3.63 %, and higher energy consumption. In contrast, the proposed P-ins DRL method obtains a control policy that better meets the requirements of balancing temperature, CO2 levels, and energy efficiency. It can be concluded that the proposed P-ins DRL method can adaptively learn the optimal control method from the dynamical environment, and is therefore applicable under different test scenarios. 5.4 Energy performance evaluation 5.4.1 Energy consumption profile The main energy consumers in buildings are the HVAC systems and equipment. Fig. 15 shows the power profile on a particular day. It can be found that electrical power is higher in the daytime and is less dependent on other factors, whereas the HVAC energy consumption is time-varying and is closely associated with zone occupancy. This funding justified the rationality and necessity of selecting the above variables as observations. Hence, this paper mainly considers optimizing HVAC energy consumption concerning outdoor environmental parameters, indoor occupancy and indoor electrical equipment use. The energy-saving performance is evaluated in the next section. 5.4.2 Energy performance evaluation Apart from thermal comfort and IAQ, energy use is another important factor that needs to be considered in HVAC optimization. Fig. 16 compares the airflow rates throughout the day for Zone 5 in Test 1 using the B2 method and P-ins DRL method. As discussed in Section 2, the airflow rate is closely related to energy consumption. Clearly, the proposed method ensures user comfort with a lower flow rate, indicating that the adoption of the P-ins mechanism is effective in minimizing energy consumption while adhering to constraints. Fig. 17 shows the daily energy consumption for all zones in Simulation 1. It's evident that B1 has lower energy consumption compared to B2, but with relatively poorer control performance. In contrast, the proposed P-ins DRL method ensures good thermal comfort and IAQ and achieves lower energy consumption compared to the other two methods. When compared to B2, the proposed method shows lower power values consumption peak hours. In actuality, the proposed method adopts a smoother and more efficient control policy when dealing with sudden changes in indoor loads. The results present the robustness of the proposed method, as it learns policy that better aligns with the predefined objectives. Fig. 18 shows the daily fan power and cooling power under different test methods over 14 test days, and Fig. 19 shows the total energy saved by the proposed method in Test 1. As shown, there is no significant difference in fan power among different methods, but the proposed method shows better energy performance in cooling power saving by reducing the energy consumption of handling fresh air. It can save at most 9.03 % total energy use and 6.42 % total energy use on average, compared with B1 method. In comparison with B2 method, the proposed method reduces 4.95 % total energy consumption on average. The tests are also conducted in Test 2 and the results are given in Fig. 20 and Fig. 21 . The proposed method can save at most 9.41 % total energy use and 6.54 % total energy use on average over B1 method. Compared with B2 method, the proposed method reduces 5.86 % total energy consumption on average. The daily and accumulated energy savings over 14 days are shown in Fig. 22 . Detailed data is given in Table 4 and Table 5 . The data shows that, the proposed method can save around 21.21 kW of energy compared to other methods. It can be concluded that the proposed P-ins DRL method is more energy-efficient. In summary, the agent in the proposed method has learned the optimal control policy and can balance the objectives of indoor thermal comfort (i.e. temperature), IAQ (i.e. indoor CO2 concentration), and HVAC power consumption. 5.5 Overall performance evaluation To quantify the improvement of the overall control performance by the proposed P-ins DRL method, this paper defines S metirc to score each test method, which expanded from the reward function, and the definition of S metirc follows the proposed P-ins mechanism: (38) S m e t i r c = 100 ⋅ ( λ T N ∑ i = 1 N α i ( 1 − D T ) + λ O N ∑ i = 1 N β i ( 1 − D O ) − λ P P P min ) / S max where α i and β i are the evaluation weights for zone i, can be defined as a fixed value of 1, or they can be obtained using the P-ins, the same values as in Eq. (28). D T and D O denote the violation occurrence rate of temperature and CO2 concentration over all zones respectively in an episode. P is the power consumption of the method to be evaluated. P min is the minimum value among all test methods in the current episode. S max is the full score among tests, which is used for normalization. Fig. 23 compares the performance score for all validation methods. As shown, the proposed P-ins DRL method achieves the highest score over the other two methods and is more stable and reliable. It can be seen from Table 6 that, the proposed method has fewer fluctuations and has higher average score values, which indicates better performance and robustness under different environmental changes. It can also be found that the overall performance of the proposed method can be improved by over 9.16 % compared with the B2 method, indicating that the proposed P-ins mechanism is effective in multi-objective HVAC control tasks, which makes the agent obtain a better balance between the comfort and energy consumption to obtain a high score. 6 Conclusion In this paper, a novel real-time optimal control method for multi-zone HVAC systems is proposed to achieve energy saving of HVAC systems while maintaining thermal comfort and IAQ. The proposed method incorporates deep reinforcement learning techniques with a preference-inspired mechanism to achieve an optimal balance between multiple objectives. The fresh air ratio and supply airflow for each zone are optimized in response to dynamic environmental disturbances like outdoor weather, indoor occupancy, and equipment utilization. An EnergyPlus and Python co-simulation testbed was established, and the proposed method has been validated by real-world data traces. The proposed method can reduce energy consumption by up to 9.41 % compared with the rule-based method, and up to 8.78 % compared with the ordinary TD3 method. Meanwhile, results show that the proposed method is robust and applicable to various comfort requirements. In future research endeavors, the occupancy patterns as well as user behaviors will be considered to further improve the performance of the proposed method.

        "dc:description": "This paper proposes a novel optimal control method for multi-zone HVAC systems to enhance energy efficiency and improve occupant comfort. To address the disturbances in outdoor weather and indoor loads, the proposed method formulates the HVAC control problem as a dynamic Markov decision process, and employs deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques to obtain the optimal control policy. To manage multiple goals among thermal comfort, indoor air quality (IAQ) and system energy efficiency, a preference-inspired (P-ins) mechanism is designed to achieve the optimal balance among different objectives. The P-ins mechanism effectively guides the agent towards the optimal control policy with high convergence rate. The proposed method has been validated through EnergyPlus-Python co-simulation testbed with real-world data traces, and assessed by an overall evaluation indicator. Results demonstrate that the proposed method can reduce energy consumption without compromising thermal comfort and IAQ. Specifically, the occurrence of temperature violations is reduced below 0.8 %, and a maximum energy saving of 9.41 % can be achieved, compared with traditional methods.",
