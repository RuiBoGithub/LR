Graphical abstract Reinforcement learning (RL) based control is widely considered a promising approach in building automation and control as it has demonstrated the potential to deal with complex objectives in adjacent domains like robotics, autonomous vehicles, gaming applications, and advertisement recommendations. When applied to any environment, model-free RL learns to improve its control performance over time without requiring a control model, by receiving and then analyzing feedback from the building environment after each control action. Operational objectives are becoming increasingly complex through the simultaneous consideration of thermal comfort, carbon emissions, grid services, and indoor air quality. In this context, conventional rule-based control approaches are proving sub-optimal, mostly heuristic, and inadequate. The model-free and self learning nature of RL appears promising and attractive as it may address the scalability issues associated with advanced control approaches. However, it suffers from long training times and unstable control behavior during the early stages of its learning process, which makes it unsuitable to be applied directly to buildings. This paper addresses these issues using an inverse reinforcement learning approach (IRL), a technique utilized to learn the objective of a controller agent which is considered an expert in its respective domain. Here, we consider a rule-based control as the expert demonstrator. IRL is different from a direct imitation (i.e., direct mapping of states to actions) of control actions as it tries to find the underlying intent of an expert\u2019s policy, providing the controller with a better-generalized policy for unseen states or environments with slightly different dynamics. This approach propels the RL controller\u2019s policy to levels similar to or better than that of a rule-based policy before it starts learning by interacting with the building. This makes RL for building energy management applications more practical as it prevents the erratic and exploratory behavior in the initial training period, simultaneously speeding up the learning process when compared to applying an untrained RL agent directly to a building environment.

Building controls are primarily responsible for the energy consumption as well as occupant health and comfort. Growing expectations directed at commercial building performance extend beyond energy consumption and thermal comfort to include more variables like indoor air quality (IAQ), providing electric grid system support, renewable energy integration and others. With the introduction of these additional performance metrics, conventional control approaches like rule-based controls or heuristic controls prove inadequate. Other advanced control approaches like model predictive control (MPC) relies on explicit physical models for thermal dynamics and system behavior, which are costly to develop and to achieve a certain degree of accuracy. Moreover, they suffer from scalability issues from one building to another as commercial buildings are widely varied in their system topology and characteristics. With these growing performance expectations, RL represents a promising data driven approach due to its ability to learn from its interaction with the building environment in a trial-and-error fashion without needing a detailed and accurate model, can perform multi-objective optimization, can cope with system uncertainties, and the computational complexity of generating actions from a trained RL agent is low. Despite of these advantages, RL suffers from unstable initial exploration, which can result in costly damage to building systems and unacceptable indoor conditions. Additionally, pure conventional direct training where the RL agent without any prior knowledge learns only by interaction with a environment is sample inefficient and may require several years to learn an acceptable policy. This makes a direct training of a RL agent impractical and unacceptable from the perspective of occupants as well as building operators and engineers. To address these practical challenges with RL, we leverage the concept of inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to shorten the time to learn a near-optimal policy and to reduce the unstable exploratory trial-and-error nature of RL learning. Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) is an approach to learning expert policies from a demonstrated data. This approach is widely explored in other fields but have almost no attention in building control applications. IRL is used to learn some of the rule-based control behavior from the available building data and with further direct training is used here to improve the learned behavior from the rule-based datapoints. Sample efficiency indicates the amount of experience or data that an agent needs from the environment to achieve a good control performance. Inverse RL has been utilized here to address this sample efficiency problem of RL in building controls. 1.1 Reinforcement learning Reinforcement learning (RL) is a branch of machine learning where an agent or controller learns to make sequential decisions by interacting with an environment to maximize the rewards ( r ) received from the environment. The aim of the agent is to maximize the total cumulative reward from the environment, also called return from its interaction with the environment. The state (S) is a vector of informational values from the environment which the agent senses to make a control decision. A Markov decision process (MDP) is the mathematical basis of RL, where the MDP is formed by components of the state space ( S ) , a set of possible actions ( A ) , a transitional probability ( P ) , and rewards ( r ) . The solution from the MDP results in a policy ( π ), which maps states (S) to actions (A). If the agent has no model or transitional probability of the environment (P), which is the case with most real world problems, the controller agent can either attempt to approximate a model and use it to come up with a control action, or can directly estimate a optimal policy or value function for its decision making process through interaction. The former approach is called model-based RL, while the latter is called model-free RL [1]. 1.2 Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) In pure or forward RL, the agent has a clear reward signal (r) which it receives from the environment. The reward signal is indicative of how good or bad a control action is in that particular state. In contrast, IRL is a type of reinforcement learning where the goal is to learn the reward function itself rather than learning an optimal control action given a known reward function. The concept behind inverse reinforcement learning is that it can be sometimes difficult to specify a particular reward function for a given problem in an environment. Learning how to drive a car is an example where it is extremely difficult to specify a reward function for a controller agent. Nonetheless, one can observe how a person drives and infer an underlying intent or reward function that could explain the actions of the driver. IRL is particularly useful where complex tasks are difficult to explain in the form of a reward function but are provided with some effective expert demonstration. In the IRL approach, an expert\u2019s demonstration of a particular task is observed and used to infer or extract an underlying reward function. This extracted reward function is then utilized to train an RL agent in a pure forward fashion to optimize for the same task. This is a form of indirect imitation where instead of a direct mapping from states to action as in a behavioral cloning approach, we utilize the underlying intent of the expert. This applies well to situations when the agent encounters states unseen in the expert\u2019s demonstration. Interested readers can look into [2] for further details. We use a particular type of IRL, called the maximum entropy IRL (MaxEnt IRL), which is explained later in Section 4. The direct training process with RL utilizing the extracted reward function from the IRL process is sometimes referred as forward RL. 1.3 Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) in building control as a transfer learning (TL) approach Rule-based controls in buildings use a set of predetermined conditional rules to govern the operation of building systems and equipment. These rules are used to control a wide variety of systems, including heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC), lighting, and building automation systems. Rule-based heuristic controls are the conventional approach and accepted norm in the vast majority of the commercial building control problems. RL shows promise due to its self learning capability but suffers from initial unstable control behavior due to exploratory behavior for the learning process and sample inefficiency which is addressed by the IRL approach. Wang et al. [3] delineates the challenges and opportunities of using RL in building controls in detail. Transfer learning (TL) is a technique in machine learning where a model trained on a particular task is reused for a new problem to solve for a similar but related task in the same or a different domain. Here, the agent is pre-trained with the IRL process utilizing the demonstrated rule-based policy in an offline fashion without interacting and exploring in a real building. The pre-trained model leverages this previous knowledge from rule-based data and fine-tunes its policy further through ongoing interaction, avoiding training from scratch while also reducing the exploratory unstable behavior and sample inefficiency of normal RL training. The following section discusses the some of the existing literature on transfer learning aspect of RL for building applications. 2 Transfer learning Transfer learning is essential for the scalability and practicality of RL controls in buildings. TL is the process of applying some knowledge gained from similar tasks or domains. TL helps in reducing the training time and the unstable exploratory behavior of the control agent in the early stages of training. This study uses inverse reinforcement learning as a form of transfer learning technique for warm-starting an RL agent. To the best of the author\u2019s knowledge, inverse reinforcement has not been used in the building controls domain yet. The novelty of this paper lies in using an approach popular in the robotics and autonomous vehicle domain and analyzing its effectiveness in utilizing this in the world of building controls. In this section, we review some of the transfer learning techniques utilized in the context of building applications. Lissa et al. [4] varied spatial dimensions and geographical locations of the buildings and studied the effectiveness of transfer learning with a Q-learning algorithm by utilizing the trained agent from [5]. With geographical changes, the discomfort time was reduced by an average factor of three after reaching the optimal policy compared to one without using TL. With spatial changes, the discomfort time was reduced by a factor of up to six compared to one without using TL. Lissa et al. in [6] reduced the training time needed to learn a near-optimal policy by a factor of five using a shared learning experience where data were being shared between the RL agents from buildings with similar equipment. Zou et al. [7] utilized a long short-term memory (LSTM) [8] to pre-train a deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm (DDPG) [9]. The developed LSTM model from real building data was used to approximate the heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) system operations. The trained RL agent, when applied to the real building was able to maintain the predicted percentage of dissatisfied (PPD) at 10% and achieved a 30% reduction in energy consumption in comparison to the existing rule-based control (RBC). Spangher et al. [10] utilized an LSTM and an ordinary least-squares (OLS) regression model to generate exploratory and artificial data samples of future observation states and actions, to be added to the memory buffer of a soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm [11]. These models were developed from two months of data. The RL agent augmented with data from the LSTM model performed better than the OLS model. In addition, a short-term memory buffer had better performance with the RL agents compared to a long-term memory buffer, which stores every data sample and never empties its memory. Xu et al. [12] addresses specifically the transfer learning aspect of RL utilizing an architecture of two networks: a front-end building-agnostic Q-network combined with a backend network that can be trained for building specific behavior. The method was effective in reducing temperature violations, training time, and energy costs, as well as reducing the state-dimensional complexity associated with a multi-zone RL controller. Costanzo et al. [13] used model-assisted batch reinforcement learning with multiple extreme learning machine models (ELM). The models were used to generate virtual datasets in state spaces where sample density is low, which were then added to the experimentally observed data for training the fitted Q algorithm. This led to a faster learning process where the RL controller could find a policy close to 90% of the mathematical optimum in about ten days of training. Deng and Cheng [14] successfully utilized a transfer learning approach to predict occupant behavior in buildings, utilizing only the high-level policy from a trained RL agent instead of transferring the weights of the trained neural networks. Tao et al. [15] utilized an Evolving Adaptation Network [16] approach along with fine-tuning the deeper layers of the neural network (NN) to perform transfer learning between different domains of battery energy storage systems (BESS) and HVAC systems. The approach was used in the demand response (DR) control strategy, where the training was done with cloud computing resources. Fan et al. [17] utilized a transfer learning approach in micro-grid scheduling where the Euclidean distance between the supply and demand curve in adjacent microgrids was used as a measure of similarity to determine which adjacent microgrid scheduling knowledge can be used as the target domain for the trained RL agent. 3 RL algorithms considered The inverse RL approach has been utilized here with the Deep-Q Network (DQN) algorithm. The other algorithm used here is the Soft-Actor-Critic algorithm. The details of theses two algorithms are offered in the sections below. 3.1 DQN algorithm DQN is an off-policy RL algorithm that can learn from any historical data or data generated from any policy other than its current policy. The DQN algorithm is derived from the Q-learning algorithm, which uses the Q-value of a state to represent the long-term expected return from taking a particular action in a state. This is mathematically derived from Bellman\u2019s Optimality Rule as shown below. (1) Q ( s , a ) = ∑ s \u2032 P ss \u2032 a r ( s , a , s \u2032 ) + γ max a \u2032 Q ( s \u2032 , a \u2032 ) With Q ( s , a ) the Q-value, s the current state and s \u2032 the next state, the agent observes as a consequence of taking action a in the state s. r ( s , a , s \u2032 ) is the immediate reward received and P ss \u2032 a is the transitional probability of the environment from state s to s \u2032 as a result of taking action a. Most of the time, this transitional probability of the environment P ss \u2032 a is unknown and is typically learned through repeated interactions with the environment with the use of a sampling updated rule, as shown below. The value function can be learned by direct interactions with the environment through adaptive heuristic dynamic programming. To learn the Q-function, temporal difference learning TD ( 0 ) is used, which estimates the state-value function of a finite-state Markov decision process under a policy π through repeated interactions with the environment. The modified update rule is given below. (2) Q ( s , a ) ← Q ( s , a ) + α r ( s , a . s \u2032 ) + γ max a \u2032 Q ( s \u2032 , a \u2032 ) - Q ( s , a ) Eq. 2 above gives the Q-value at state s when selecting action a, where r ( s , a ) is the immediate reward received and Q ( s \u2032 , a \u2032 ) is the maximum Q-value that can be obtained by taking action a \u2032 in the next state s \u2032 . P ss \u2032 a is the transition probability from state s to s \u2032 by taking action a. α is a hyper-parameter between 0 and 1 and represents the learning rate. The hyper-parameter γ is called the discount factor and controls the weighting of the long-term rewards to immediate rewards, whose value is also between 0 and 1. To avoid converging to a sub-optimal Q-value if the agent keeps on selecting the best known action every time, the best action is picked with a probability ( 1 - ∊ ), while a random action is taken with a probability of ∊ . ∊ is another hyperparameter between 0 and 1 that controls the exploration of the agent. The ∊ value is reduced once the state-space and actions of the environment are thoroughly explored. The estimated Q-value with this update rule will slowly converge to its true maximum Q-value after iterating over time due to its recursive nature. The recursive nature lets the Q-values eventually arrive at their true values as rewards from future states propagate back to past states. In a Deep Q-Network, the state-action value is replaced with a value function approximation. A function approximation is a technique to estimate an unknown function from historical observations when the true function is unknown. A deep neural network is used as the value function approximator of the Q-value function. This allows the user to have continuous states as inputs to estimate the value function and thus allows them to scale the RL problem to a large multi-dimensional space, instead of having a discrete state space. This is represented as Q ( s , a , θ ) where θ are the weights of the neural network. The transitions are stored in the form of a tuple of ( s , a , r , s \u2032 ) . This memory is called experience replay memory. The main idea is to reduce the regression error between the prediction of the Q-value of an action Q ( s , a , θ ) and the target, which is approximated as r ( s , a , s \u2032 ) + max a \u2032 Q ( s \u2032 , a \u2032 , θ ) . Random mini-batches of ( s , a , r , s \u2032 ) tuples are sampled from the experience replay memory and stochastic gradient descent is performed on the deep neural network to reduce the loss function between the prediction and the target. Drawing random samples helps in reducing the correlation between the batches as correlated samples might cause the network to converge slowly. Both the target and the prediction have the same weights θ in the neural network. This causes a non-stationary target in the loss function where the target changes during learning, which in turn causes instability issues. To address this non-stationarity, the θ parameters of the target are calculated with a fixed old version θ \u2032 which are updated with the θ parameters, once after a certain number of steps. DQN has been found to work well in game environments with discrete action spaces but it has not performed well on continuous control benchmarks [18]. 3.2 SAC algorithm The SAC is a popular state-of-the-art off-policy RL algorithm which is known for being sample efficient and less sensitive to hyperparameter tuning for convergence compared to other RL algorithms. The algorithm can handle continuous states and action spaces. The objective in SAC is optimized with regards to both the expected long-term reward as well as entropy, in order to induce some randomness in its policy, which in turn reduces the likelihood of becoming stuck in a local optimum and encouraging some exploration. Three value function (V) approximators are used in the algorithm; the value function ( ψ ), the critic parameters ( θ ), and the policy network ( θ ). The objective ( J V ) of the value function V is expressed in Eq. 3, while the objective ( J Q ) of the critic Q-network parameters is given in Eq. 4 and its modified form in Eq. 5. (3) J V ( ψ ) = E ( s t ) ∼ D 1 2 V ψ ( s t ) - E a t ∼ π ϕ [ Q θ ( s t , a t ) - log π ϕ ( a t | s t ) ] 2 (4) J Q ( θ ) = E ( s t , a t ) ∼ D 1 2 Q θ ( s t , a t ) - q t 2 where q t = E a ∼ π ϕ ( . | s t + 1 ) [ r ( s t , a t ) + γ ( Q θ ( s t + 1 , a ) - α log π ϕ ( a | s t + 1 ) ] ) ) ] Two critic networks θ 1 and θ 2 are used here which learn simultaneously and the minimum value of Q ( s , a ) is taken to prevent overestimation. Overestimation bias in uncertainty leads to inaccurate policy estimates and can move policies toward sub-optimal actions. The critic networks update their network parameters following the modified objective function as shown below. (5) J Q ( θ ) = E ( s t , a t , s t + 1 ) ∼ D 1 2 Q θ 1 ( s t , a t ) - q t 2 + Q θ 1 ( s t , a t ) - q t 2 where q t = r + γ E a ∼ π ( . | s t + 1 ) [ min i = 1 , 2 Q ( θ i ) - α log π ϕ ( a | s t + 1 ) ] ) ] (6) J π ( ϕ ) = E ( s t ) ∼ D D KL π ϕ ( . | s t ) e Q θ ( s t , . ) Z θ ( s t ) The policy network ( ϕ ) is trained based on the concept of minimizing the error of the objective as described in Eq. 6, which aims to make the distribution of the policy function similar to the exponential distribution of the Q function normalized by the Z function. This is based on the Kullback\u2013Leibler Divergence. The modified objective from Eq. 6 is expressed as follows. (7) J π ( ϕ ) = E ( s t ) ∼ D , ∊ t ∼ N log π ϕ a t | s t ) - Q θ ( s t , a t ) where a t = f ϕ ( ∊ t , s t ) The action a t is parameterized to ensure that sampling from the policy is differentiable. The soft actor-critic algorithm is an off-policy deep RL algorithm that has proven to be sample efficient and can capture multiple modes of good policies due to the introduction of entropy in its objective function. We refer the reader to [11] for in-depth details about SAC. 4 Inverse reinforcement learning 4.1 Introduction IRL involves learning from an expert\u2019s demonstration. The goal of IRL is to extract the reward function from the observed behavior of an expert\u2019s demonstration. The reward function extracted from IRL assumes that the expert\u2019s demonstrated action are optimal, or close to optimal. Typically, this observed behavior comes from human demonstrations like driving a car, riding a bicycle, walking, flying a plane, or other tasks. This is different from direct imitation or behavioral cloning as it tries to understand the underlying intent of the expert following the demonstrated trajectories. Conversely, behavioral cloning is a simple mapping from state to action that cannot be easily transferred to environments with slightly different dynamics. It can also not learn a complex pattern of actions if the demonstrated data is sparse and does not cover most of the state space. Moreover, if we have an imperfect expert demonstration agent, IRL has the potential to improve and outperform the demonstration agent. In [2] IRL was used to find a policy mimicking an expert by estimating the reward function. The reward function in that study was a linear combination of state features. This approach was used to imitate an expert\u2019s different driving styles successfully. One early application of IRL that attracted attention was for helicopter flight controls. In this, an expert\u2019s complex control preferences were learned using recorded behavior data, and the reward function extracted from the IRL process was further used to teach advanced maneuvers in a remotely controlled helicopter using forward RL [19]. [20] used a novel IRL method, called maximum entropy IRL (MaxEnt IRL) and used herein, to infer route preferences of taxi-cab drivers. Other examples of using IRL are quadruped locomotion [21], human path planning [22], human goal inference [23] and parking lot navigation [24]. 4.2 Maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning In IRL, we have an optimal or near-optimal expert\u2019s policy π ∗ in the form of expert demonstrations or expert trajectories. The general approach is to find a reward function for which the previously demonstrated expert actions are optimal and thereafter use the reward function to optimize the policy with normal forward RL in the same or new environments. In IRL, an arbitrary mapping of states to an n-dimensional vector ( ϕ : S → R n ), called a feature, is performed to do the calculation [2]. Here, we utilize a linear reward function with regards to features, such that R ( τ ) = ω T ϕ ( τ ) , as utilizing a linear reward function is guaranteed to find a policy equivalent or better than the expert policy π ∗ with respect to the reward. The foundation of IRL is based upon the concept of matching the expectation of the features by the recovered reward function. This essentially means that the policy followed by the agent from the recovered reward function should have the same expected visitation frequency ( E π [ ϕ ( τ ) ] ) of features, represented mathematically as: (8) E π ∗ [ ϕ ( τ ) ] = E π L [ ϕ ( τ ) ] = ∑ τ p π L ( τ ) ϕ ( τ ) where π L is the learner\u2019s policy derived from the computed reward function, τ is the trajectories of the policies and p π L [ ϕ ( τ ) ] is the probability distribution of the learner\u2019s trajectory. This formulation still is ambiguous as multiple reward functions can attain the same expected feature-visitation frequency. This is resolved by maximizing the entropy of the distribution of the learner\u2019s policy p π L as proposed in [20], essentially picking the solutions that have the least bias. This approach is called the maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning approach (MaxEnt IRL), which is utilized in our research. The distribution of trajectories is parameterized by the weights of the reward function, where trajectories with higher rewards are preferred more exponentially. They are represented mathematically as shown below. (9) For deterministic MDPs : P ( τ | ω ) = e R ( τ ) Z ( ω ) = e ω T ϕ ( τ ) Z ( ω ) (10) For stochastic MDPs : P ( τ | ω ) ≈ e ω T ϕ ( τ ) Z ( ω ) ∏ p ( s t + 1 | s t , a t ) where Z ( ω ) = ∑ τ e ω T ϕ ( τ ) The objective in IRL thus is to maximize the entropy (H) of the distribution of p where H = - ∑ p ( τ | ω log p ( τ | ω ) , which becomes: (11) max p H ( p ) s . t . E π L [ ϕ ( τ ) ] = E π ∗ [ ϕ ( τ ) ] ∑ τ p ( τ | ω ) = 1 , ∀ τ : p ( τ | ω ) > 0 The ω parameters that determine p can be found by maximizing the log-likelihood over the demonstrated set of trajectories D = { τ i } 1 N . The objective function and the gradient is shown below and is solved iteratively by gradient ascent. (12) ω ∗ = argmax ω L ( ω ) = argmax ω ∑ τ log p ( τ | ω ) Δ ω L ( ω ) = E π L [ ϕ ( τ ) ] - ∑ τ p ( τ | ω ) ϕ ( τ ) = E π L [ ϕ ( τ ) ] - ∑ s i F s i ϕ ( s i ) ∑ τ p ( τ | ω ) ϕ ( τ ) can be written as F s i ϕ ( s i ) where F s i is the state visitation frequency under the assumption that ϕ ( τ ) = ∑ t = 0 | τ | ϕ ( s i ) . We utilize the method as suggested in [20] to calculate the state visitation frequency F s i . 5 Novelty and contribution This paper presents a novel approach as an alternative to utilizing rule-based control which addresses the drawbacks of the practical application of RL controls, as described in the introduction. The conventional approach to transfer learning is to pre-train an RL agent with a simplified model and then transfer the agent to similar building environments. We show that a data-driven approach with rule-based data is sufficient to propel the RL agent\u2019s policy to a decent start and a much more stable learning curve during the training. IRL has been used mainly in the autonomous and robotics world, but to the best of the authors\u2019 knowledge, IRL as a transfer learning technique has not been used in the building control\u2019s domain. IRL requires some expert demonstrations, and in this study, we use rule-based data as the expert demonstrator. The use of IRL helps in letting the RL controller know about the underlying intent of the rule-based controller, which prevents the requirement of full exploration of the RL agent in the initial stages. This approach also prevents the RL controller policy from deviating rapidly from the rule-based policy during training, as the reward function extracted from the IRL process is biased towards the rule-based controller policy. 6 Case Study 6.1 Building environment simulation In this study, we utilize a recently released open-source building performance simulation test bed, the Advanced Controls Test Bed (ACTB) [25]. This software environment allows for the testing and development of advanced building controllers in a high-fidelity building modeling environment able to reproduce realistic control system behavior. The ACTB interfaces with Spawn of EnergyPlus [26] building models that use Modelica to simulate HVAC systems and EnergyPlus for simulating heating and cooling loads and envelope response. This combination of Modelica-based models with EnergyPlus in Spawn allows for dynamic simulation and implementation of control actions as it would in real physical buildings. The ACTB leverages the Building Optimization Performance Tests (BOPTEST) [27] and Alfalfa [28] frameworks to run the simulations enabling an external controller to interact with the building model through a representational state transfer (REST) application programming interface (API). This provides an easy, user-friendly experience for developing an advanced controller which is agnostic of any programming language. The ACTB is also able to generate key performance indicators (KPIs) for evaluating the effectiveness of various control strategies. The external controller has the flexibility to override and implement both low-level and high-level HVAC control actions, and those which are not overridden are designed to follow ASHRAE Guideline 36 [29]. 6.1.1 OpenAI Gym interface Here, we utilize the OpenAI Gym [30] interface of the ACTB and use well-established Python libraries for developing the RL controller. The OpenAI Gym interface is highly customizable in formulating an RL control problem. It has the ability to utilize and adjust the weights of different KPIs in forming the reward function to the control action, to easily select and form the observable states consisting of building sensors and weather variables and to formulate a demand-limiting problem. Fig. 1 illustrates an overview architecture of the ACTB. 6.1.2 Datasets used In this study we have two datasets. The first one is the building data of three months consisting of rule-based control actions as mentioned later in Section 6.3.3, which we use for the IRL process. The second dataset is six weeks (42 days) of random summer days, which we later use for training and testing of the forward RL process. This was split with a ratio 1:6 for the testing and training process, leading to 36 training days and 6 test days. 6.2 Implementation process The implementation process consist of two steps: the inverse learning and then the forward learning. The inverse learning part involves training an RL agent named here as Ag inv with the underlying intent of learning the rule-based action. The agent Ag inv does not interact with the building and learns fully offline utilizing the IRL method. The forward RL agent named here as Ag for takes the learned parameters of the agent Ag inv and trains further with the training set further improving the policy learned by the agent Ag inv by virtue of online interaction with the actual building environment. These two processes are described in detail below. Fig. 2 provides a visual representation of the entire process while the pseudocode for the process is summarized in Algorithm 1. 6.2.1 Inverse reinforcement learning implementation The implementation of the MaxEnt IRL requires some knowledge of the model in the form of the state transitional dynamics P ss \u2032 a to compute the reward function. Although, a true model is always difficult to obtain, discretizing with a relatively large resolution of the states as mentioned in Section 6.3.1, helps to form the state-transitional dynamics P ss \u2032 a , which here were computed from the three months of rule-based data. Since the rule-based building data is not data-rich or, in other words, have not sufficiently explored the state space, we are left with many unseen states in the vector space where the transitional dynamics are unknown. Here, we utilize a neural network model (NN) to predict the transition from the current state S inv to the next state S \u2032 inv . Utilizing the rule-based data, we train this NN in a supervised fashion to predict the temperature change due to the control actions and form the next state. We add stochasticity to this predicted transition by assuming a 95% probability of transitioning to the predicted state s \u2032 and 5% to the rest of the states. This helps in the convergence of the linear feature weights ω forming the reward function. For example, if there are four possible discretized states in S inv like [ s 1 , s 2 , s 3 , s 4 ] , if the NN model predicts the transition to state s 3 from the unseen state s 1 under control action a 1 , then instead of probability p ( s 3 | s 1 , a 1 ) = 1 and ∑ p ( s i | s 1 , a 1 ) = 0 ; we utilize p ( s 3 | s 1 , a 1 ) = 0.95 and ∑ p ( s i | s 1 , a 1 ) = 0.05 where i ∈ { 2 , 3 , 4 } . With the extracted reward weights ω with the IRL process, the reward function and the state transitional dynamics model P ss \u2032 a are utilized to form the state-action value table Q ( S inv , a ) for all possible discrete states S inv and actions a. The main idea of the RL agent before it interacts with the real building is to learn this state-action value estimate. Thus, we utilize the DQN algorithm for the RL agent where it learns this state-action Q-value estimate. Essentially the deep network θ will need to learn the mapping from state S inv to Q ( S inv , a ) , which can be done in a supervised fashion. However, the states in S inv have a large resolution which is not suitable for learning the optimal action with interaction with the real building. Thus, we design a continuous state-space with S for with features as mentioned in Section 6.3.2 meant for the forward RL process and a state translator from S for to S inv . We randomly generate multiple artificial data points in the state space of S for and the corresponding Q ( S inv , a ) value using the state translator. Then, supervised learning is performed with the DQN agent\u2019s Ag inv network parameters ( θ q ) to predict the Q-values of the artificial data points such that Q ( S for , a ) ≈ Q ( S inv , a ) , where S for is the corresponding state for S inv . This state-action value learned by the RL agent will generate a policy that is likely to mimic rule-based actions. This knowledge transfer from rule-based data is intended to reduce the unstable exploratory training behavior as well as reduce the sample inefficiency of RL agent. 6.2.2 Forward reinforcement learning implementation The reward function ( r inv ) extracted depends on the state-visitation frequency and not on the actual objectives like thermal discomfort, energy consumption or any other building key performance indicators. The Q-values derived from the r inv are also arbitrary and thus the next step is to learn the true Q-values from the environment, which is done by further interacting with the building online in the forward reinforcement learning. The network parameters θ q are then transferred to the forward RL agent ( Ag for ), which then trains online by interacting with the building. We train the RL agent for 100 episodes, where each episode is a day from the training dataset. We utilize a combined reward function as shown later in Eq. 14. ω i ϕ ( S \u2032 inv , i ) is the extracted reward for the particular state, where ϕ ( S inv , i ) is the feature for the state S inv , i . The weighing parameter c is introduced as this places some importance on the rule-based controls. Higher c values will keep the policy more aligned with the rule-based policy and this might not be preferred if the rule-based policy is very sub-optimal in performance. Thus, lower c values are preferred in the reward formulation. We try three c values of 0.1, 0.01, and 0 (no importance to rule-based control policy) and investigate their effect on the online training progress. This is shown in Fig. 7 in the Results section. The c = 0 parameter places no importance in the rule-based controls and with further interaction, the RL agent will eventually forget the rule-based policy and optimize solely based on the objectives based off on real feedback data. The mismatch between the learned Q-values from the IRL process and the true Q-values is finally reduced with the online training with the real building. Algorithm 1: Pseudo-code for the inverse and forward reinforcement learning process 1.Pre-process the rule-based building data and form states s t and actions a t in discrete state and action space. 2.Form the state-transition probability matrix P ss \u2032 a from the trajectory of building data. 3.Perform IRL with P ss \u2032 a and rule-based trajectories from building data to extract the linear reward weights ω for the features ϕ . 4.Calculate Q ( S inv , a ) from the rewards extracted from IRL and P ss \u2032 a . 5.Create artificial data-points in S for and calculate their equivalent Q ( S inv , a ) values. 6.Perform supervisory training with θ dqn to predict Q ( S inv , a ) such that Q ( S for , a ) ≈ Q ( S inv , a ) . 7.Transfer the trained θ dqn to the DQN agent utilized. 8.Perform forward RL with the combined reward function 9. r = r for + cr inv , where r inv = ω i ϕ ( S inv , t ) 10.Continue performing forward RL until scores converge or the agent shows very little sign of improvement. 6.3 Formulation of the problem This study is conducted on a simulation of a small office building based on the DOE prototype small office building [31]. It has a total floor area of 511 m 2 , consisting of four perimeter zones and a core zone in a single story. Each of the five zones is supplied by a packaged constant air volume rooftop air handling unit (AHU). The AHUs have a gas-fired heating coil, a single-stage direct expansion cooling coil, an outside air damper without an economizer, and a constant volume fan. The simulation takes place during the cooling period. The objectives considered in this study are to reduce energy consumption and thermal discomfort and to participate in a demand response (DR) program. The DR program considered here is a target demand limit, where the building is expected to shed around 25% of its peak load. The average whole building peak power was found to be approximately 20,000 W on a peak summer weekday. Thus the demand limit here was taken to be 15,000 W during the DR event. In the summer months, the utility peak demand is usually expected in the late afternoon period. Thus, in this study, we consider the DR event to occur in the late afternoon between 4:30 p.m. and 5:30 p.m., with a duration between 2-3 h. The thermal comfort bound in this study varies according to the time of the day, where during unoccupied hours, it has a larger band of [ 15 ° C , 30 ° C ] , while during occupied hours it is [ 21 ° C , 24 ° C ] . The occupied hours are set between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. 6.3.1 States considered for inverse RL ( S inv ) The state feature selection is based on features on which the rule-based conditions are based upon. The discretization of the states helps in easily forming the state-transitional matrix P ss \u2032 a from the rule-based data. Initially, we discretized the state-space to a finer resolution but found having a more finely discretized space leads to unnecessary computational complexity as the dimension of the state-transitional matrix increases exponentially. Also, the rule-based data does not explore the state-space which can be utilized to our advantage by having discretized states which the represents a larger regions of the state-space in terms of separating them in terms of most visited states versus regions of unseen states. For example in the discretization of the indoor room temperature t r , we could represent indoor reasonably comfortable temperatures which we expect to see in a rule-based data by one discretized state and regions which are too cold or too hot by other separate discretized indexed states. Having a coarse resolution also helps in easily extracting the reward function from the IRL process. The full discretization of the states are mentioned below. \u2022 T zm - Current mean temperature of all the five zones in the building. This is discretized into six indexed states where T zm ∈ { 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 } . 0 represents temperature values less than 20 ° C while 5 represents temperature greater than 26 ° C. The rest of the index starting from 1 to 4 stand for temperature values from 20 ° C to 26 ° C with 1.5 ° C interval. \u2022 t occ - Occupancy signal is a binary signal where t occ ∈ { 0 , 1 } . 0 represents unoccupied hours while 1 represents occupied hours of the building. \u2022 T oa - This indicates the current outside air temperature. The state is discretized into three indexed states where T zm ∈ { 0 , 1 , 2 } . 0 represents temperature values less than 21 ° C while 2 represents temperature greater than 24 ° C. Any temperature between 21 ° C to 24 ° C is indexed as 1. \u2022 DR gr - DR signal indicating the remaining time to a DR event or if there is an ongoing DR event. The state is discretized into four indexed states where DR gr ∈ { 0 , 1 , 2 , 4 } . The basis of the index states is described in detail in Table 1 . Index 4 indicates the terminal state indicating the end of an episode of a day of 24 h. We include a terminal state indicator here instead of having a separate state for it as this reduces the total number of discretized states. The final state space ( S inv ) consists of [ T zm , t occ , T oa , DR gr ] . Since the states are discretized, these led to the formation of a total of possible 180 states. Here, each unique state was considered as a feature ϕ i for IRL, thus leading to 180 features. Initially, we started with a finer discretization, leading to a complexity that a conventional computer could not handle. This mainly arises from forming the state-transitional matrix of shape ( s n , s n , a n ), where the complexity increases exponentially with a larger number of possible discrete states and actions. 6.3.2 States considered for forward RL Here, two types of state design were considered, one for the inverse learning approach and the other one for the forward reinforcement learning agent. The state design for IRL is discrete and is designed to reduce the complexity of the problem, while the forward RL can take continuous state space design. We describe the design of the states for forward RL below. \u2022 T zm - Current mean temperature of all the five zones in the building. \u2022 t hr - Time of the day in hour format. \u2022 T oa - Current outside air temperature. \u2022 DR cnt - Countdown time in hours to the DR event of the day. \u2022 DR cur - Binary signal if there is an ongoing DR event. The final state space ( S for ) consists of [ T zm , t hr , T oa , DR cnt , DR cur ] . These continuous states are normalized by a min\u2013max normalization to the range [ 0 , 1 ] for the RL agent. In this study we utilize the Deep-Q Network (DQN) agent [32] with experience replay as the RL agent. To compare the effectiveness of the IRL process, two DQN agents have been utilized: one which uses the reward function from the inverse RL and the other agent which simply performs forward RL, starting from an untrained state. The two agents Ag inv and Ag for both utilize the same network structure and hyper-parameter settings as well as have an unlimited memory buffer. Both the agents started with a low exploration rate of 5% which is further reduced to 3% at the end of the training period. Each episode is considered a day\u2019s worth of interaction. 6.3.3 Rule-based controller The rule-based controller (RBC) design consists of mainly three rules. \u2022 Cooling is turned off during a DR event. \u2022 Cooling is turned on two hours before any DR event to pre-cool the building. \u2022 During other times of the day, cooling is turned on if the mean-zone temperature is above the upper bound of the thermal comfort band and turned off when the mean-zone temperature is below the upper bound. Fig. 3 shows the example of a rule-based control. The control is the low-level on\u2013off input signal of the cooling coil with a timestep of 5 min. 6.3.4 Reward formulation The rewards or feedback for the RL agent are shown in Eqs. (13) and (14). (13) r for = w 1 p disc T disc w 2 occ + w 3 p e E w 4 + w 5 p dr ( P - P t ) w 6 (14) r = r for + cr inv where , r inv = ω i ϕ ( S inv , i ) where: T disc = Thermal Discomfort Penalty per step [Kh] E = Energy Consumption per step [kWh] P = Whole Building Power per step [kW] P t = Whole Building Power Limit during DR Event [kW] w 1 = Linear hyperparameter for T disc w 2 = Exponential hyperparameter for T disc w 3 = Linear hyperparameter for E w 4 = Exponential hyperparameter for E w 5 = Linear hyperparameter for Power Penalty w 6 = Exponential hyperparameter for Power Penalty p disc = Price for Thermal Discomfort [$/Kh] p e = Linear hyperparameter for Power Penalty [$/kWh] p dr = Price for Demand Charge [$/kW] occ = Occupancy [-] c = Hyper-parameter for IRL feature ω i = Extracted linear feature weight of S inv , i r for is the reward formulation that is used by the normal approach with forward RL agent Ag for . r for consists of the penalty terms for thermal discomfort, energy consumption, and power demand limit violation of the whole building. In the formulation of the rewards, the KPIs have been converted to price-based penalties. The commercial electricity cost is taken to be AAAA 0.0405 /kWh [33] with the demand charge being AAAA 7.89 per kW of power demand limit violation. The mean salary of the office employees was taken to be AAAA 40 /hr. The productivity cost due to thermal discomfort was assumed to be a 2% decrease in productivity for every 1 ° C deviation from the thermal comfort bounds based on [34]. The thermal discomfort penalty is also proportional to the occupancy of the building. Fig. 4 displays the occupancy schedule of the whole building. The issue with pure price-based penalties is that the price of energy is very low compared to thermal discomfort costs. The linear weights w 1 , w 3 and w 5 are introduced so that the energy consumption have equal importance in the objective function. The rewards (r) for Ag inv consist of a combined reward function as shown in Eq. (14), where the rewards from the IRL process ( r inv ) are added to the reward function of Ag for , weighted by a factor c. The c helps control the preservation of the rule-based policy in the objective. The hyperparameter weights w i selected for this problem are w 1 = - 50 , w 3 = - 1 , w 5 = - 1 and w 2 = w 4 = w 4 = 1 during the DR event and w 1 = - 50 s , w 3 = - 1 , w 5 = 0 during other times of the day. The term s is introduced as a scaling factor to the energy KPI which is based on the outside air temperature T oa . The scaling factor is set to 1 when T oa > 20 ° C and s = 2 ( 20 - T oa ) + 1 when T oa ≤ 20 ° C. The scaling factor further discourages the controller from overcooling when the outside air temperature is low. The whole building power demand limit P t is 15 , 000 W. 6.3.5 Actions considered The RL controller action consists of a low-level on\u2013off cooling coil. The objective of the agent is to minimize ∑ t = 0 T r for , t from Eq. (13), where T is the terminal step of each episode. The time step of the control action is taken to be five minutes and the same action is repeated to all the zones. 7 Comparison with other RL approaches To study the effectiveness of the IRL approach, we compared the performance of three common RL approaches. The approaches investigated here are: direct training, offline training, and metamodel training. To ensure a fair comparison, the state variables are the same as in the forward RL training with the agent Ag for , while the reward utilized here is the r for as mentioned in Eq. 13. 7.1 Direct training Direct training represents the standard RL approach, where the RL agents interact with the building environment without any pre-training or other learning approaches utilizing rule-based data. The agents start without any prior knowledge with randomized initialized parameters. The agent explores the environment by trial-and-error and with environmental feedback. While it trains, it learns to take actions that will lead to high rewards. The problem with the approach as mentioned before is its high exploration in the initial learning phase which might cause damage to equipment and unsatisfactory performance in a real-world application. Direct training is effective when the negative consequences of exploring in the real world are not grave and a longer training time can be afforded for the agent to learn the near-optimal action like RL applications in online marketing suggestions and targeted advertisements; but in the building controls the world, this approach seems untenable in terms of unstable training behavior and long training times. Effectively, it might take substantial time to learn a near-optimal approach, thus making it unsuitable for real-world application. We apply this direct training here to compare the relative performance merits of our IRL approach to the direct training in terms of final performance and the improvement in terms of the training time. In the direct training process, the agents are trained for 100 days with the same training days as the IRL approach. The agent starts without pre-training and learns simply by interaction. The agent starts with an exploration rate of 30%, which is gradually reduced after every training update to stop at an exploration rate of 5% at the end of 30 training days. 7.2 Offline training Buildings are generally operated by rule-based controls, which are conditional rules based on some indoor and outdoor conditions. Offline training relies on learning from this normal operational building data following the rule-based controls. Before applying an RL agent, the agent has access to this building data. The building data is pre-processed to formulate a tuple of state (s), action (a), next state ( s \u2032 ), reward (r) and the done flag (d) as per the RL agent considered. However, there are disadvantages of learning from offline data in buildings. The rule-based building data are generally sparse and this is generally inadequate for the RL training as the state space is not sufficiently explored. The RL agent does not get to see the consequences of taking poor actions and thus leading to incomplete training of the RL agent from this limited data. This may cause poor performance when the trained RL agent interacts with real buildings. Offline training can be effective if the data generated is sufficiently rich and explores most of the environmental state space. We test the offline training approach, in this case, to see if it is effective in finding a policy better than the rule-base policy. We train the RL agent from the same rule-based data used for the IRL reward extraction following rule-based data. The RL agents had the same states and reward formulation as the IRL process mentioned before. The building data was pre-processed to form the tuple (state, action, next state, reward) for the offline training process. The RL agents were trained on the offline data till the training loss showed no signs of improvement. 7.3 Metamodel training Pre-training with a metamodel sometimes proves to be an effective RL training strategy in view of applying the agent to a real building. This approach reduces the training time as well as the unstable exploratory behavior exhibited by the direct training method. The RL agent can explore the state space with the metamodel in simulation without any real consequences to a real building. This helps the agent to have a better value estimate of the consequences of taking particular actions in particular states. Moreover, the metamodel can help train the agent for longer periods of time in simulation time instead of waiting for months or years in real time to learn an optimal action. Although training with a metamodel sounds effective, there are several challenges to this approach. The success of the metamodel training lies in the accuracy of the metamodel developed vis-a-vis the real building environment. Any model mismatch between the real building environment and the metamodel may result in poor performance of the trained RL agent when it is transferred to the real building environment. The metamodel extraction process is often challenging and requires engineering expertise. Furthermore, it is difficult to extract an accurate metamodel for complex building environments involving many features. Buildings are unique and thus it becomes difficult to extract an accurate metamodel for each building. Moreover, the quality of the metamodel depends on the quality of the building data available. Variation in building data is beneficial as it leads to developing a more accurate metamodel. The RL agent can then fully explore the state-space using the metamodel without incurring any of the negative consequences of exploration and can also discover regions of high rewards which the agent can exploit in the real building environment. To ensure a fair comparison, we extract the metamodel from the same training rule-based building data of 30 days which we use for the IRL process. The metamodel was identified using the subspace state space system identification (N4SID) method employing the rule-based building data. The rule-based building data consists of a month\u2019s worth of building operational data. In the model selection process, the input control variables considered were the cooling coil on/off actions for the five zones, outside air temperature, horizontal global irradiation and the occupancy of the individual zones. The output variables considered were the zone temperatures of the building. We created a Gym interface of the metamodel and formulated the reward function r for . To formulate the reward function r for , along with thermal discomfort comfort costs we also need to know the power P and the energy consumption E of the building for the demand limit violation and energy costs. For ease of the development of the model, we did not consider the power consumption of individual zones as output variables from the extracted metamodel. We utilized a simple formulation where a fixed average power cooling power consumption from the rule-based building data was considered when the cooling coil was turned on. These helped to form the whole building power P, and the energy consumption E was derived from the power consumption P) to form the reward function r for . The metamodel training was conducted for 100 training weekdays. The progress of the DQN agent with the metamodel is shown in Fig. 6 , while Fig. 5 shows the comparison of the metamodel mean temperature response to the small office building. 8 Results The difference in training and testing performance for the RL approaches considered is discussed in this section. To summarize, we are comparing the performance of other RL methods to the inverse reinforcement learning approach to highlight the benefits of the approach. Two types of comparison are performed here, where the first type involves only utilizing the rule-based data without any forward training or interaction, while the second comparison involves how well the agent can improve its policy by forward RL (interacting with the real building) after t he inverse RL training. Table 2 presents the performance results of the several approaches on the training dataset. The approaches are recapitulated below: \u2022 Ag RBC : Performance of the rule-based controller (RBC). \u2022 Ag DQN Off & Ag SAC Off : Performance of the agents after offline training with the rule-based data with no forward RL training, utilizing both DQN and SAC algorithm. \u2022 Ag DQN Meta & Ag SAC Meta : Performance of the agents after offline training with the metamodel extracted from rule-based data with no forward RL training, utilizing both DQN and SAC algorithm. \u2022 Ag DQN IRL : Performance of the agent after inverse reinforcement learning training from the rule-based data without any forward reinforcement learning (no training with the training dataset). \u2022 Ag DQN Dir & Ag SAC Dir : Performance of the agents after pure direct training for 100 episodes of a day without any inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), utilizing both DQN and SAC algorithm. \u2022 Ag DQN IRL , c : Performance of the agents utilizing both the inverse from rule-based data and forward reinforcement learning process on 100 episodes of the training dataset, utilizing the DQN algorithm. Approaches with agents Ag DQN Off , Ag SAC Off , Ag DQN Meta , Ag SAC Meta and Ag DQN IRL do not involve any direct interaction and solely rely on the existing building rule-based data while the rest of the agents Ag DQN Dir , Ag DQN Dir and Ag DQN IRL , c after the inverse RL process, train by interaction on the training dataset for 100 episodes of a day. Fig. 10 shows the difference in the performance of the RL agents utilizing metamodel training versus the performance of the agents trained only offline with the same data on which the metamodel was extracted. Fig. 11 shows the comparison of the RL agents using pure direct training versus the agent utilizing IRL, after training for 100 days. Fig. 7 shows the training progress of the RL agents with DQN algorithm, using three weighing factors in the formulation of the combined reward function. The dotted red lines show the agent\u2019s progress without using RL in a direct training process. The parameter c has been tested with three values of 0.1, 0.01, and 0. The RL agent Ag DQN IRL , ( c = 0 ) , which had only r d in the reward formulation, performed the best on the six test days. The Ag DQN IRL , ( c = 0 ) showed a cost reduction of 38%, while Ag DQN IRL , ( c = 0.1 ) and Ag DQN IRL , ( c = 0.01 ) offered a reduction of 28% and 32%, respectively, when compared to the performance of the rule-based controls on the same test day. Although the RL agent with c = 0 performed the best out of the three, the training progress was the most unstable. The figure here shows a 14-day moving average cost obtained by the agents during the training. Compared to the direct training approach, all three agents\u2019 training progress showcases a lower average cost as well as a much more stable performance. The results show that the RL approach utilizing IRL is effective in starting with a better policy when compared to an untrained agent, along with a more stable learning process highlighting the benefits of this approach for field deployment. The performance of the agent in the first episode, without using any IRL, is shown in Fig. 8 , while Fig. 9 shows the performance of the agent on the first test using only IRL training and no forward RL (no interaction). After training, all trained RL agents and the baseline rule-based controller\u2019s performance are tested on the test dataset of the six summer weekdays. The test days have the same starting and ending times of the DR event so that the costs attained by the agents are comparable. Table 2 showcases the performance results of the following approaches: 9 Discussion Inverse reinforcement learning proved to be effective in reducing the training time, having a much more stable learning experience from the start as well as better performance than RL agents Ag DQN Dir and Ag DQN Dir trained for the same number of episodes. This approach was able to extract some of the intent of the rule-based controls without interaction with the environment as is evident from the results of Ag DQN IRL . Although the agent can extract the policy of keeping the internal zone temperature within the thermal comfort bounds, it could not avoid the power demand limit penalty. This may be due to some of the inaccuracies associated with transitional dynamics P ss \u2032 a used in the IRL. These transitional dynamics pose a challenge for complex environments as they are difficult to determine from a limited data set like rule-based building control data. Incomplete transitional dynamics may lead to a reward function extraction that only incompletely extracts the intent of the demonstrator. We use a NN model to model the transitional dynamics from the unseen states which due to the limited data set might have some inaccurate estimation. Although the transitional model is not accurate and the states are coarsely discretized, the IRL process has proven to be superior in comparison to other methods like offline training or metamodel training which also uses the same rule-based data. In this approach, the IRL reward function was utilized in the reward function with the forward RL. The combined reward function with the IRL rewards keeps the agent\u2019s policy closer to the rule-based policy during the training interaction with the building, providing a more stable learning process than the direct training method. Moreover, it performs decently well in the first episode, which is difficult to achieve with an RL agent that has not interacted with the environment at all. Offline training with the same rule-based data was tried but this performed extremely poorly both with the two algorithms. This is because the rule-based data cover only a limited region of the state space, which leads to a very inaccurate value estimation of the state. Thus, once the agent moves out of these seen states, it leads to very poor control behavior, which is evident from our results with the offline training approach. The performance of the agent with the metamodel training was much improved as the RL agent was able to explore and acquire a decent estimate of the value function in the far-out regions of the state-space. However, an accurate metamodel is often difficult to extract with the increasing complexity of the problem to be considered and thus suffers from scalability issues. The difference in the thermal response of the metamodel and the real building often leads to sub-optimal performance, as we can see in the results. The offline training performed very poorly as it only relied on the limited data-set from the rule-based data. Although, it may have reasonably good estimates of the value-function in the visited states of the rule-based data but due to inaccurate estimation of the value-function outside this region, once the agent moves out of these known states into unknown states, the performance of the agent collapses. In pure RL training, with interaction and exploration, the agent achieves a good value-function estimation, which cannot be done purely on a limited data-set like a rule-based data which lacks sufficient coverage of the state space. In this respect, inverse reinforcement learning has an advantage, as the learning relies on state-visitation frequency. In its training, it tends to devalue the unseen states in its value-function estimation and thus, even if the agent moves out into unseen regions of the state-space, the learnt policy tries to bring the agent back to the states frequented by the rule-based policy, even though they may be sub-optimal. This limits the exploration of the RL training and also aids in improving the sample efficiency of the training process with forward RL as is seen in the Fig. 7. With forward training, the bias towards rule-based policy is rectified and leads to a proper Q-value estimate based on actual objectives, thus improving the policy. The IRL approach is beneficial in warm-starting a RLC controller to a state where it can take reasonable decisions. The approach is generalizable in the sense that it avoids the extensive building modeling effort needed for a MPC or an RLC pre-training approach. The model development aspect for each building is often difficult, expensive, and time-consuming for large complex systems and is not scalable. This method presents a data-driven approach where traditional rule-based data is utilized to make the controller understand the underlying intent of the rules developed and make further improvements on these conventional rules with the forward RLC approach. The starting policy of the IRL approach cannot be expected to outperform markedly over the RBC, but can be expected to be similar to or exhibit slight improvement in performance to the rule-based policy. Unlike autonomous vehicle and robotics applications, where manual simple rules are challenging to hardcode, in the buildings domain, some simple rules are trivial, intuitive and can utilize known strategies like having an acceptable temperature range of 21\u201324 ° C, pre-heating or pre-cooling before a demand response event, having a setback supervisory setpoint during different occupancy modes. In a real-world implementation, this IRL approach is useful and practical as it avoids the early unstable exploratory training stages of a RL controller without model development effort. The IRL approach in the buildings domain is not meant to deliver a demanding building energy system strategy outright but can be viewed as an intermediary step to have a decent RLC controller, addressing the implementation challenges faced with normal RLC training. Even if the building does not have building data or historical data, a simple rule-based policy can be developed and utilized for several days for the IRL training. After the IRL process, the forward training improves this existing policy online based on demanding objectives as required by building owners, control engineers, or building occupants from the feedback provided by the building from its control actions. The benefit of this approach lies in preventing the RLC controller from making potentially harmful exploratory decisions in the initial training stages and addressing the sample inefficiency problem faced with normal RLC training. This combined inverse and forward RLC approach harnesses the advantages of model-free RL, addressing some of its practical disadvantages. 10 Future work and limitations The first limitation of this particular study presented is that its applicability to systems with more control degrees of freedom has yet to be demonstrated. In this study, we used a discretized state and action space as it is relatively straightforward to generate the transitional matrix from the building data to test the effectiveness of the IRL approach. For more complex systems with larger degrees of freedom, the discretization process, as utilized in this study, will exponentially increase the complexity of the problem and thus becomes impractical. Despite the inaccuracies of the state transitional matrix from the limited rule-based data, the IRL approach is beneficial in extracting a reward function that explains the rule-based behavior and incorporates this uncovered behavioral knowledge into the RL agent before it interacts with the real building environment. For future work, we hold that a continuous transitional matrix, i.e., a multi-modal transition distribution, needs to be investigated to handle more complex systems. Another future task will be to investigate the transfer of the Q-values to other state-of-the-art RL agents like soft-actor-critic, which can accommodate continuous states and actions. The second limitation in this approach (as described in the discussion) is that with the IRL approach, the RL agent cannot be expected to significantly surpass the rule-based control policy in terms of its control performance. The policy learned from IRL process depends on the quality of the rules developed and will be similar to the rule-based policy. The advantage is that it avoids the extensive model development process and significantly reduces the RL agent\u2019s training time to attain the level of a rule-based controller. Buildings with no prior data need to be trained with rule-based control policies for this IRL approach; in this study, three months\u2019 worth of operational building data was utilized. In this approach, the value of the weighing parameter c was selected in an ad hoc fashion. Research is needed to determine this weighing parameter c and also to investigate effective measures for the transition of the learned Q-values to the true estimation of the Q-value with further online interaction. 11 Conclusion In this research, although we present a simple temperature control problem, this approach can be generalized to other objectives, including indoor air quality, occupant comfort, and electric grid objectives. However, the challenge lies in coping with the numerical complexity of such a problem with more degrees of freedom and thus further research is needed on this subject as explored in the section on future work and limitations. In this manuscript, we showcased that this approach serves as a viable and practical alternative to metamodel pretraining which requires resource-intensive model development. With the IRL process, the RLC is able to uncover the knowledge of a rule-based controller and improves further with ongoing forward reinforcement learning training. The research shows that the IRL approach has the potential to serve as an important mitigating step in addressing the early learning challenges of directly applying an untrained RLC controller to a building.

        "dc:description": "Reinforcement learning (RL) based control is widely considered a promising approach in building automation and control as it has demonstrated the potential to deal with complex objectives in adjacent domains like robotics, autonomous vehicles, gaming applications, and advertisement recommendations. When applied to any environment, model-free RL learns to improve its control performance over time without requiring a control model, by receiving and then analyzing feedback from the building environment after each control action. Operational objectives are becoming increasingly complex through the simultaneous consideration of thermal comfort, carbon emissions, grid services, and indoor air quality. In this context, conventional rule-based control approaches are proving sub-optimal, mostly heuristic, and inadequate. The model-free and self learning nature of RL appears promising and attractive as it may address the scalability issues associated with advanced control approaches. However, it suffers from long training times and unstable control behavior during the early stages of its learning process, which makes it unsuitable to be applied directly to buildings. This paper addresses these issues using an inverse reinforcement learning approach (IRL), a technique utilized to learn the objective of a controller agent which is considered an expert in its respective domain. Here, we consider a rule-based control as the expert demonstrator. IRL is different from a direct imitation (i.e., direct mapping of states to actions) of control actions as it tries to find the underlying intent of an expert\u2019s policy, providing the controller with a better-generalized policy for unseen states or environments with slightly different dynamics. This approach propels the RL controller\u2019s policy to levels similar to or better than that of a rule-based policy before it starts learning by interacting with the building. This makes RL for building energy management applications more practical as it prevents the erratic and exploratory behavior in the initial training period, simultaneously speeding up the learning process when compared to applying an untrained RL agent directly to a building environment.",
