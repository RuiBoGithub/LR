Model-free heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) control systems have demonstrated promising potential for adjusting indoor setpoint temperature based on dynamic occupancy patterns in smart buildings. Although these control systems offer the advantage of not needing building or occupancy models, the involved trial-and-error learning process can cause considerable thermal discomfort for occupants, particularly during the initial learning period. Given the critical importance of thermal comfort, this limitation is a major barrier to the practical implementation of such systems. To address this challenge, the present study proposes a framework to enhance the learning process of the model-free HVAC controllers. Specifically, a transfer learning (TL) technique is adopted based on a similarity analysis of occupancy patterns using an unsupervised learning of occupancy profiles. This control framework leverages a k-means clustering algorithm with dynamic time warping to match the most similar households in terms of occupancy patterns within 26 residential units. The results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the performance of the HVAC control system. It enhances the jumpstart performance and total rewards by nearly 25% and 5%, respectively, compared to a conventional model-free controller. Furthermore, it reduces the deviation period and mean temperature deviation by approximately 4% and 68%, respectively. Overall, this framework presents a promising approach to enhancing the performance and practicality of model-free HVAC control systems by reducing the thermal discomfort during the learning process.

The majority of the conventional control systems ignore dynamic occupancy patterns and, consequently, cannot differentiate between occupied and unoccupied zones in buildings. This way, heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems are prone to operating needlessly for conditioning vacant areas, causing considerable amount of energy waste. To overcome this limitation, earlier studies investigated occupancy-based HVAC control methods, which can adjust HVAC operation to occupancy states [5]. Reactive control can be utilized as a straightforward approach to reduce energy waste. It saves energy by using a setback temperature when the building is unoccupied while trying to bring back the desired temperature as soon as the occupants return [6]. Using a reactive control showed the ability to save energy in the range of 5\u20138 % [7]. Despite its energy saving potential, the reactive nature of the controller can cause thermal discomfort due to the existing delay in reaching the desired temperature [8]. Occupancy-based control systems can be predictive, going beyond only considering the instant occupancy states and predicting future occupancy patterns. In other words, they can leverage the historical data to predict the future arrival time and start pre-conditioning the indoor environment before occupants return. Moreover, the depth of setback temperature can be adjusted to the estimated duration of the vacancy periods [9]. It was reported in [10] that these systems can result in up to 12.9 % annual cost saving, 2.72 years of payback period, and 12.24 % annual energy saving, when compared with a fixed-temperature controller. Predictive occupancy-based HVAC control was proposed as an advanced control technique in earlier studies [5]. Such systems heavily rely on the prediction models to forecast future changes in occupancy patterns. Their prediction power plays a vital role in determining the control performance because any false positive or false negative predictions can bring about energy waste and thermal discomfort, respectively [11]. Many researchers investigated different types of machine learning and statistical methods to predict future occupancy patterns [12\u201321]. Huchuk et al. [22] studied the performance of data-driven occupancy prediction using different models, including logistic regressions, random forests, Markov models, hidden Markov models, and long-short term memory. They evaluated the models based on an occupancy database collected from 100 thermostats installed in different residential units. The results demonstrated that the prediction accuracy mostly varied in the range of 65 %-85 %, depending on the case study and the model. 1.1 Related research work Occupancy prediction models can be integrated with different predictive control methods. Rule-based control (RBC) was the most-utilized method in earlier studies because of its simplicity and effectiveness [9,11,16,19\u201321,23\u201329]. As the name suggests, they leverage a set of pre-defined rules to adjust the indoor temperature to the forecasted occupancy states. For instance, controllers can initiate the HVAC operation one hour before the building becomes occupied. However, because building thermal mass, HVAC capacity, and occupancy patterns often significantly differ among buildings, RBC\u2019s operation might not be optimal in many cases [5]. To address this limitation, model predictive control (MPC) was proposed to reach an optimal point for control systems [30\u201335]. As well as using occupancy models, MPC employs optimization algorithms and building models to search for optimal temperature settings. MPC was mainly utilized to find the optimal indoor temperature by making a trade-off between energy consumption and thermal comfort. However, the need for occupancy models, building models, and optimization algorithms not only increases the complexity of the control problem but also damages the controllers\u2019 generalization potential for use in new buildings. Oldewurtel et al. [30] reported that these complications can be a preventative factor for implementing them in practice. Model-free reinforcement learning (RL) was proposed as an alternative method to MPC with the aim of providing more generalization, eliminating complications associated with developing separate models, and reducing the computational efforts [36]. The RL algorithms can search for optimal control temperature settings by learning occupancy patterns, building energy consumption patterns, and building thermal mass with no need for developing separate models or optimization algorithms. Brandi et al. [37] implemented deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for determining the optimal HVAC operation in an office building and demonstrated up to 12 % energy saving, compared with an RBC system. Barrett and Linder [38] optimized thermal comfort and energy saving using a DRL approach in residential buildings. They found that the controller could save energy by up to 10 % and provide acceptable level of thermal comfort, compared with programmable thermostats. Brandi et al. [39] utilized DRL algorithms for thermal energy management, aiming to minimize the operational costs in buildings and compared its performance with that of an MPC. They reported that the control policy achieved by the DRL algorithm was as effective as the MPC operation in terms of cost saving. Despite the growing number of research works on evaluating and improving the performance of the RL algorithms for building control, the dynamic occupancy patterns have been neglected in most of the previous studies. Esrafilian-Najafabadi and Haghighat [40] proposed the use of a double-deep Q-networks (DDQN), as a DRL algorithm, to control the indoor operative temperature with the consideration of dynamic occupancy patterns. They evaluated the effectiveness of the controller by comparing its performance with that of an MPC. The results demonstrated that the RL method improved thermal comfort by approximately 8 %, compared with an MPC. Although the operation of RL-based controllers is satisfactory, they tend to provide poor performance during their learning processes until the optimal policy is achieved [40]. More specifically, the trial-and-error nature of their learning processes during the initial period of operation might bring about severe thermal discomfort for occupants. Consequently, such control systems might not be practical in real cases because of the vital importance of thermal comfort. As reviewed in [41], researchers have proposed the use of transfer learning (TL) to enhance the performance and generalization potential of control systems. TL techniques have been successfully implemented in smart buildings to improve the performance of occupancy estimation [42], thermal comfort prediction [43], energy consumption forecasting [44\u201346] and HVAC control [47]. Khalil et al. [48] demonstrated that an LSTM model based on a TL technique can improve the occupancy prediction in office buildings when there is not sufficient data available. Fan et al. [49] showed that using TL can reduce the energy demand prediction by up to 78 % when compared with conventional models. Lissa et al. [50] evaluated the impact of TL on the training speed of a DRL algorithm. The developed TL approach resulted in a training speed that was five times faster than using standalone models. 1.2 Research gaps and contributions RL algorithms that operate without relying on forecast models have been promising methods for developing HVAC controllers in buildings. As discussed in the previous section, they can save energy and improve thermal comfort while not demanding occupancy prediction models or optimization algorithms. Nonetheless, the trial-and-error nature of their learning process is a major preventative factor for them to be implemented in practice when dynamic occupancy is considered. More specifically, it can take a number of years for the RL algorithm to interact with the building environment and learn the optimal actions [40]. During this long learning phase, severe thermal discomfort can be raised due to the non-optimal operation of the HVAC system. The successful applications of TL in the building sector can lead to a promising solution for addressing this issue. However, there is no information on TL\u2019s potential benefits in terms of improving thermal comfort and energy saving when it is combined with model-free occupancy-based HVAC control. There is a need for research focusing on the learning phase of these controllers for obtaining the optimal operation in real-world applications. This study proposes a novel framework to accelerate the learning process of RL algorithms in occupancy-based HVAC control. This framework integrates the conventional RL algorithm as the HVAC controller, an unsupervised learning technique for similarity analysis, and a TL method to boost the performance of the learning process. The integrated system intends to address the limitations of the conventional model-free HVAC controllers when practical cases are concerned. The aim is to enhance thermal comfort and energy saving, particularly during the periods when a new self-learning smart thermostat begins its operation in a household. This framework leverages the experience of pre-trained controllers to facilitate the development of new ones. For this purpose, a deep Q-network DQN algorithm is developed and trained based on the occupancy data collected from 26 residential units in an apartment block. A k-means clustering method based on a dynamic time warping (DTW) distance metric is utilized to extract dominant daily occupancy profiles of the households. These patterns are utilized for a similarity analysis to find the closest households in terms of occupancy patterns. Then, a TL technique is implemented to improve the learning process of a new controller by transferring the experience of the pre-trained ones in the most similar households. To evaluate the system\u2019s effectiveness, its performance is compared with that of a conventional RL algorithm in terms of jumpstart performance, asymptotic performance, total rewards, thermal comfort, and energy saving. The rest of this research work is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the proposed methodology including the development of the control framework, data preprocessing, and performance evaluation. The results are provided and discussed in Section 4. Finally, the main findings of the study and the conclusions are discussed in Section 5. 2 Methodology 2.1 General description of the control framework The schematic diagram of the proposed control framework is demonstrated in Fig. 1 . The control system works based on collecting data from a set of dwellings called train cases. They can be virtual buildings, created through simulation software, or can be experimental testbeds where actual control systems are installed in (Section 3). Data from the train cases need to be collected and preprocessed as described in Section 2.2. The building-related data including indoor temperature and occupancy states, as well as weather data are utilized to develop an RL control system for each home (Section 2.3). The occupancy data is utilized in an unsupervised learning technique to find the dominant occupancy patterns associated with each household (Section 2.4). The extracted occupancy patterns and the pre-trained control agents are stored in a database so that they can be employed in a TL process (Section 2.5). The system leverages such information to enhance the control performance in a new unseen home, called a test case. As soon as a test case connects to the network, the system starts collecting new occupancy data. This information is used to provide an estimation of the test case\u2019s occupancy patterns and find its most similar train case (Section 2.5.1). The experience of the most similar pre-trained agent is transferred to the test case\u2019s control agent to accelerate the learning process. Ultimately, the control system starts interacting with this relatively new home to improve itself and to save energy while enhancing thermal comfort. The performance of the proposed control system is measured based on how the agent performs in the test case (Section 2.6). 2.2 Database description and preprocessing A general overview of the occupancy database and the preprocessing steps are illustrated in Fig. 2 . The database is constructed based on the signals received from passive infrared (PIR) motion detectors installed in 26 residential units in an apartment block. The building consists of one-, two-, and three-bedroom units with each having an average of 13 PIR motion detectors installed. A detailed description of the apartments can be found in [51]. The data was originally stored in an occupancy database at 1-min intervals with each data record taking values of 0 and 1 , showing the vacancy and occupancy states, respectively. The data is prepared for use in the control process after two preprocessing steps. First, the data granularity is reduced by aggregating the data from a one-minute level to a 30-min level to accelerate the control process and minimize the impact of potential motion detector errors [22]. Secondly, the missing values that exist in the database due to sensor or network failures are replaced by the value of 1 , to ensure that thermal comfort is not sacrificed when no reliable occupancy data is available. As described in Section 2.1, the databases collected from the train and test cases are required to develop the control system and evaluate its performance. To create these databases, an individual apartment is randomly selected among the total 26 apartments as the test case, and the rest 25 are remained as the train cases. After developing the control system and evaluating its performance using this configuration, a different apartment is selected as the next test case with the rest as the train cases. This iterative process results in 26 evaluations to cover all the apartments. The evaluation is performed for an entire heating season starting from November 1st to March 31st, which is considered an episode for the RL algorithm, described in Section 2.3. 2.3 Control system A self-learning control system, inspired by the RL algorithm proposed in [40], is utilized in this study because of its promising performance in terms of thermal comfort and energy saving. More specifically, a DQN algorithm for determining the indoor optimal setpoint temperature based on dynamic occupancy patterns is implemented. The problem formulation follows a Markov decision process (MDP), which consists of a reward signal, an action space, and a state space [36]. The relationship between the states, rewards, and actions in an MDP framework is demonstrated in Fig. 3 . In the first step, the agent perceives the environment through the current state, st , which demonstrates the relevant information about the present situation [52]. Based on this state, the agent selects an action from its available set of actions according to its learned policy. The chosen action represents the agent's decision on how to interact with the environment. In the next step, the environment transitions to a new state, and the agent receives an immediate reward that quantifies the desirability of the taken action. This reward serves as feedback to the agent, guiding its learning process to make better decisions over time. The new state and the received reward together constitute the feedback loop that updates the agent's understanding of the environment. The following sections provide more detailed information about the states, actions, and rewards, with a focus on formulating the control framework. 2.3.1 State space A state represents the current situation of the environment, in which the agent is operating. It includes all the information the agent needs to make decisions. In this study, the sate-space needs to be defined in a way that it helps the agent to predict the future occupancy states and adjust the operative temperature accordingly. Four types of variables, namely previous occupancy states, the hour of the day, outdoor temperature, and operative temperature, are utilized to represent the environment to the agent. The first two attributes are selected to enable the agent to learn the occupancy patterns and to forecast the future occupancy states. The agent can utilize the second two features to learn the HVAC energy consumption, building thermal inertia, and HVAC lag-time to determine the optimal indoor temperature. 2.3.2 Action space The agent can choose between three discrete actions of deep setback, conservative setback, and the desired setpoint temperature, which are respectively assumed as 15 °C, 19 °C, and 22 °C. It is worth mentioning that the thermal mass of the building could enable the agent to reach intermediate temperatures by switching between the defined values. Therefore, considering a continuous action space can overcomplicate the control process while it might not necessarily improve the performance [37]. It is important to note that even though the temperature can vary in the range of 15\u201322 °C, the thermal comfort temperature is set to 22 °C. This wide range enables the agent to save energy only when the building is not occupied. According to the Eq. (1) described in the next section, the agent is penalized whenever occupants are present and the temperature differs from the desired setpoint, which represents the ideal comfort level. If the agent anticipates a prolonged vacancy, it may opt for a more aggressive temperature setback at 15 °C to maximize energy savings while not sacrificing thermal comfort. Similarly, in cases of shorter vacancies, the agent might choose a milder setback at 19 °C. This strategy ensures that the temperature can be returned to a comfortable level (i.e., 22 °C) before occupants return. 2.3.3 Reward The DQN agent always strives to select the best actions that can maximize the accumulated rewards. The reward signal can be interpreted as the main goal of the control system [53]. In occupancy-based HVAC control, minimizing energy consumption and thermal discomfort are considered two important objectives. Therefore, the reward function is defined in a way that clearly reflects these two terms [37]: (1) r ( t ) = - β ( E C ( t ) ) - ( 1 - β ) O ( t ) T op ( t ) - T sp 2 where EC denotes the amount of energy consumption in kWh, O is the binary occupancy state, Top is the indoor operative temperature, Tsp is the desired setpoint temperature, t is the considered time step, and β coefficient is used to weight the energy and thermal comfort terms. The value of β is determined through a trial-and-error process. When the value of β is set to 0 , the agent only focuses on maintaining the temperature at the desired setpoint, regardless of whether the building is occupied or not. This approach ultimately turns the agent into a fixed temperature thermostat, which causes energy waste when the building is vacant. On the other hand, setting it to 1 creates a control system that aggressively keep the temperature at the deepest setback, aiming to save as much energy as possible, regardless of occupancy states. However, this strategy becomes impractical as it neglects the need for occupants' thermal comfort. The objective is to maintain a balance between these two extremes, achieving the following goals: 1. Keeping the temperature at the desired setpoint when the building is occupied, 2. Reducing the temperature towards a deeper setback when the building is expected to remain vacant, and 3. Pre-conditioning the indoor environment before occupants return, ensuring a comfortable indoor temperature upon their arrival. To find this balance, the values of β are explored within the range of 0.1 to 0.9, while carefully monitoring the agent's behavior. Through observation, it becomes apparent that a value of 0.75 can meet the specified goals and, consequently, is selected to construct the reward function. 2.3.4 Interactions of the building and control system The interactions of the HVAC control system and the building is based on the reward, action-space, and state-space, summarized in Table 1 . As demonstrated in Fig. 4 , in the first step, the required variables, occupancy states, time of the day, indoor temperature, and outdoor weather conditions are given to the agent so that it can define the setpoint temperature. Then, the determined setpoint is applied to the building HVAC system to control the indoor temperature. Next, the sensor network, including motion detectors, temperature sensors, and energy meters, sends the next state and rewards to the controller as feedback. The RL agent starts learning the fitness of the made decisions and corrects itself to maximize energy saving and thermal comfort. This process is iterated at each timestep to enhance the control decisions and adapt to the new conditions. 2.3.5 Deep Q-networks (DQN) Q-learning was originally proposed to find optimal solutions for the MDP as a model-free learning approach [54]. This technique aims to select the actions that lead to the highest accumulative rewards (Q-values) in each state. It was developed based on Q-tables for storing and retrieving the Q-values associated with each state. However, when the problem contains continuous action or state spaces, the use of Q-tables becomes infeasible [53]. To overcome this limitation, Q-tables are replaced by deep neural networks (DNN) in developing the DQN algorithm [55]. To determine the optimal structure of the DNN, the number of hidden layers, the number of neurons, and the activation function are considered as the hyperparameters. The DNN is used to estimate the optimal action-value function, which is defined as follows: (2) Q ∗ ( s , a ) = max π E [ r t + γ r t + 1 + γ 2 r t + 2 + . . . | s t = s , a t = a , π ] where Q ∗ ( s , a ) is the optimal action value, E is the expected value, π is the policy, and γ is the discount factor. The discount factor is a parameter used to balance the importance of immediate rewards versus future rewards in the agent's decision-making process. It plays a crucial role in determining the agent's preference for short-term rewards versus long-term cumulative rewards when selecting actions. It can vary in the range of 0 to 1 [56]; If it is set to zero, it means that the agent only considers immediate rewards. Since future rewards are not taken into account, the agent does not engage in any form of long-term planning. This might be appropriate for tasks where only the present moment matters and the agent does not need to consider future consequences. Nevertheless, for the purpose of this study, a long-term planning is essential because of the HVAC system delay in changing indoor temperature. On the other hand, if the discount factor is set to 1 , it means that the agent values all future rewards equally and considers them with the same weight as immediate rewards. However, in most real-world applications, including occupancy-based HVAC control, the value of future rewards is less than the immediate rewards due to uncertainty. To find the optimal value of the discount factor, it is defined as a hyperparameter and is determined through a hyperparameter tuning process. In order to determine the weights of the DNN network, also called the Q-network, the following loss function is minimized in respect to the weights of the network: (3) L i ( θ i ) = [ ( r + γ max a \u2032 Q ( s \u2032 , a \u2032 ; θ i - ) - Q ( s , a ; θ i ) ] 2 In which Li is the loss function, θ is the Q-network\u2019s weights, and θ - is the target network\u2019s weights. The target network is a copy of the Q-network that is used to generate target Q-values during training. The target network\u2019s parameters are not updated as frequently as the Q-network\u2019s parameters to provide a more stable learning. The target network update coefficient determines to what extent its parameters are shifted towards the Q-network network\u2019s parameters during each update. Hard and soft update methods are commonly used for this purpose. In a hard update method, the target network's parameters are completely replaced with the parameters of the source network at specified intervals. While hard updates are straightforward, they can introduce sudden and potentially destabilizing changes to the learning process, which may lead to learning instabilities and convergence issues. In a soft update method, the target network's parameters are updated gradually by blending the parameters of the source network and the target network using a weighting coefficient as follows [57]: (4) θ - = ( C ) θ + ( 1 - C ) θ - where c is the soft update coefficient. Soft updates allow for smoother transitions between parameter sets and help to maintain stability during the learning process. By gradually updating the target network, the algorithm can mitigate the sudden changes that might arise with hard updates, leading to more consistent learning and convergence. The choice between soft and hard updates depends on the specific problem. In this study, the update method and the coefficient are selected as the hyperparameters of the model. In the DQN algorithm, a policy is defined as a mapping from the observations to the selection probability of each action. In other words, the policy results in taking a certain action as a function of the state of the environment and the Q-values. In this study, a Boltzmann policy is implemented, in which the following probability function is used for each action based on the corresponding Q-values: (5) P ( a | s ) = exp ( Q ( s , a ) / τ ) ∑ i exp ( Q ( s , i ) / τ ) in which P ( a | s ) is the probability distribution for action a given state s and Q denotes the Q-value. τ coefficient is called temperature value that can affect the search rate, and is considered as a hyperparameter. Based on the above descriptions, The implementation of the DQN algorithm for developing the HVAC control system is summarized in Table 2 . The process begins with initializing the reply buffer based on the buffer size. A replay buffer is a key component in the DQN that stores a collection of past experiences, including earlier states, actions, and rewards. As the agent interacts with the environment, it collects experiences and adds them to the replay buffer. The buffer has a maximum capacity determined by the buffer size. When the buffer becomes full, new experiences replace older ones. This way, the agent does not learn from experiences immediately after encountering them. Instead, it samples a batch of experiences from the replay buffer to learn from. The buffer size determines how many experiences are available for sampling [58]. A larger buffer can allow the agent to learn from experiences that occurred further in the past, enabling it to better understand long-term dependencies in the environment. However, using a too large buffer size might cause slower convergence and a delayed response to changing environments. Older experiences in the buffer become less relevant to the current state of the environment and using outdated experiences can hinder learning, as the agent may rely on information that is no longer accurate. To find the optimal value of the buffer size, this study considers it as a hyperparameter to be tuned. 2.3.6 Hyperparameter tuning process A random search method is utilized for hyperparameter tuning, which is a critical aspect of optimizing machine learning algorithms because of its influence on the performance and convergence. This search method involves randomly sampling hyperparameters from predefined ranges (Table 3 ) and evaluating the controller's performance for each configuration. The setup with the highest control performance in terms of the accumulated rewards is selected as the ultimate hyperparameters of the model. This study assumes 100 iterations with pre-defined values of each parameter based on the domain knowledge and experience. The determined hyperparameters of the algorithm and their defined ranges in the hyperparameter tuning process are summarized in Table 3. 2.4 Unsupervised learning In the control framework, the target of the unsupervised learning process is to determine the dominant occupancy patterns of each household. As demonstrated in Fig. 5 , this process begins with a data preprocessing step, in which the structure of the occupancy database is transformed. More specifically, a new database is created, in which each element represents a daily occupancy profile (Section 2.4.1). Next, a k-means clustering method is applied to this database to extract the dominant occupancy patterns associated with every household (Section 2.4.2). After finding the occupancy patterns of all the households, the process is stopped, and the results are stored. 2.4.1 Database preprocessing Before employing the clustering method, daily occupancy profiles need to be extracted from the original occupancy database. This process creates a new database with 24 features, representing the occupancy states at each hour of the day. These attributes are binary variables, taking 1 if occupants are present at the corresponding hour. A sample data element of this database is visualized in Fig. 6 . This diagram can be interpreted as a daily occupancy profile, showing that the occupants stayed at home from almost 18:30 to 9:30 and left the home at 9:30. 2.4.2 K-means clustering using dynamic time warping The k-means clustering is a widely utilized unsupervised learning technique [59]. It is implemented to extract the dominant occupancy patterns for each household. This algorithm organizes the data elements within different groups (i.e., clusters) based on their similarities [60]. It is a common practice to measure the similarity via the Euclidean metric. In this way, the distance between the occupancy profiles on two different days, denoted by d1 and d2, can be calculated as follows: (6) D Euclidean = ∑ t = 0 23 ( O d 1 , t - O d 2 , t ) in which D Euclidean is the Euclidian distance, t denotes the hour of the day, and O indicates the occupancy state. The clustering algorithm begins with randomly defining k centroids within the database, in which k is the predefined number of clusters. Then, the distances between all data records and the centroids are measured, and each record is assigned to its closest cluster. After organizing all the data into the determined groups, the average values of intra-cluster points are calculated and utilized to relocate the centroids [61]. The process stops when the centroids\u2019 locations converge [62,63]. It should be noted that the use of the Euclidean distance might lead to ignorance of some similarities in the shape of occupancy profiles [64]. In some cases, although the overall shape of daily patterns can be very similar, the arrival or departure time might be shifted by one or two timesteps. To illustrate such cases, two sample daily occupancy patterns from the same household are demonstrated in Fig. 7 . Both days follow quite similar occupancy patterns; the occupants leave at around 10:00 in the morning and come back after 18:00. Despite their exact arrival time, they leave almost one hour earlier in the morning in the day (b). In such cases, using the Euclidean metric might result in rather large distances and low similarity between the profiles. A bi-directional alignment of the occupancy profiles can enable the algorithm to consider the similarity in the shapes. To this end, the DTW algorithm is utilized in this study. The DTW aims to minimize the distance between two time-series profiles by implementing dynamic programming [65]. In this method, the distance between different pairs of points in two profiles is calculated and stored in a corresponding matrix. Using dynamic programming, the shortest paths between the points are utilized to measure the closeness. The described clustering methodology based on the DTW metric is implemented in Python using tslearn library [66]. As mentioned earlier, the clustering process using the k-means technique depends on the defined number of clusters. In this study, its optimal number is determined based on a Silhouette score [67]. This score evaluates the similarity of data records to their clusters (intra-cluster similarities) and compares it to their similarity to the neighbor clusters (inter-cluster similarities). A larger score indicates that the samples are good fits for their assigned clusters, and accordingly, the number of clusters that lead to the highest score is considered optimal [68]. However, it should be noted that each cluster must be representative of a certain occupancy pattern of households. Hence, a cluster with a size of only a few days is too small to reflect a dominant occupancy schedule. To avoid creating such meaningless clusters, a minimum sample number of 14 days is selected as a constraint for cluster creation. The highest cluster number that meets this requirement and results in the highest Silhouette score is selected as the optimal cluster number. 2.5 Transfer learning This section proposes a methodology to transfer the experience of a pre-trained controller to a new one to be employed in an unseen building with the aim of accelerating the training process. The schematic diagram of this process is depicted in Fig. 8 . The control process begins with collecting the occupancy information from the new test case. Although a long data collection can lead to more accurate analysis, it delays the start of the control process, which might cause a waste of energy and cost. In this study, it is assumed that 14 days of data collection from the new building can provide an acceptable trade-off between these factors. In step 2, the occupancy patterns of the new building are compared with those of the train cases so that the similarity can be evaluated (Section 2.5.1). Then, the DQN controller that is trained on the most similar building is reused to initialize the weights of the Q-network for the new control system. In step 3, the control loop begins, and the agent starts interacting with the environment to make control decisions while improving its policy. During this process, weights of the Q-network, which are initialized based on the source task (i.e., train cases), are fine-tuned as new experience is provided in the target task (i.e., test cases). 2.5.1 Similarity analysis The similarity is quantified by measuring the Euclidean distance, d, between the occupancy profile in the test case and the centroids determined by unsupervised learning for the training cases. An overall score, S, is assigned to each centroid as a function of the measured distance using the following equation: (7) S c = d c - d min d max - d min in which d c represents the distance between centroid c and the occupancy profile in the test case. The defined score can vary in the range of 0 \u2013 1 ; the higher values represent a higher similarity. It is worth noting that there is a limitation to using this score coefficient for transferring the agent\u2019s experience to a new building; the formula does not consider the number of samples that exist in a cluster. In this way, the score does not differentiate between a dominant cluster that contain the majority of the days and a minor cluster having only a few days. To avoid this potential shortcoming, the similarity score is revised based on the number of samples in clusters as follows: (8) W S c = S c Number of data elements in cluster c Number of total data elements for the household where WSc represents the weighted score for cluster c. Using this score function, the clusters with more elements have priority to be selected for transfer learning. 2.6 Performance evaluation It is acknowledged that the use of transfer learning adds complexity to the control process. Hence, the proposed control framework essentially needs to provide superior performance to justify the added complications, compared with conventional algorithms. Seven metrics are employed to quantify the performance as proposed in [40,69]: Jumpstart performance (JP): This criterion investigates the initial performance of the agent; it is defined as the sum of the rewards over the first heating period (i.e., the first episode of training) for the DQN algorithm with and without TL. Asymptotic performance (AP): In contrast to the JP, this metric focuses on the final performance of the agent. In other words, it quantifies to what extent TL can improve the ultimate policy learned by the agent. As the learning process is a continuing task (i.e., the learning process do not end in practice because of potential changes in occupancy patterns), the maximum episodic reward is defined as the asymptotic performance. Total performance (TP): This criterion evaluates the total rewards over the training period, which equals the area under the reward curve. An agent can gain more rewards by starting with higher performance in the initial step, by learning faster, and by converging to higher performance. Temperature deviation (TD): In contrast to the previous metrics that were defined as a function of the reward, this criterion provides a more practical quantification by considering thermal comfort. As the name suggests, TD demonstrates the temperature difference between the actual operative temperature and the desired setpoint over an entire episode for each time step as follows: (9) TD ( t ) = T op ( t ) - T sp O ( t ) = 1 0 O ( t ) = 0 where t denotes the time step, Top is the operative temperature, and Tsp shows the desired setpoint temperature. It should be noted that the temperature difference takes a value of zero for those periods when the occupants are not present because in such cases, no thermal discomfort can be caused. Mean temperature deviation (MTD): This metric is calculated as a function of TD; defined as the average of the TD over the entire period using the following equation: (10) MTD = ∑ t = 1 L TD ( t ) L in which L indicates the number of time steps in an episode. Deviation period (DP): Similar to the MTD, this parameter is also defined based on thermal comfort. While MTD and TD quantifies how large is the temperature deviation, DP shows the duration when occupants might not be satisfied with the indoor temperature because of the deviation. More specifically, it shows in what proportion of an episode the occupants are present while the difference between indoor temperature and the setpoint is more than 0.5 °C. (11) DC ( t ) = 1 T D > 0.5 ° C 0 T D ⩽ 0.5 ° C (12) DP = ∑ t = 1 L DC ( t ) L × 100 where DC is the deviation coefficient used to calculate the DP. Mean energy consumption (MEC): In addition to thermal comfort, the control system aims to improve the energy saving in the buildings. To achieve this goal, it is of critical importance to measure and compare the energy consumption associated with different control systems. The MEC metric is calculated as the average amount of energy that is consumed over the entire episode per control time step (i.e., 30 min). (13) MEC = ∑ t = 1 L EC ( t ) L in which EC is the amount of energy consumption per time step. 3 Case study It should be noted that the database utilized in this study do not contain the HVAC energy consumption of the residential units and the energy data is generated via simulating a residential building, which is described in this section. This study employs a single-story detached building proposed in [10] as a case study to assess the impact of employing the control framework based on its performance. The conditioned spaces in this building include three bedrooms, two bathrooms, a kitchen, and a living room with an approximate net area of 135 m2. To achieve reliable simulation results, the construction material is selected according to ASHRAE [70] as summarized in Table 4 . The house is simulated based on weather data, available in [71], for a very cold climate and only the heating season from the first of November to the end of March is considered for the simulation period. Electric baseboards are considered as the heating equipment with an efficiency of 100 %. In the first step, the 2D floor plan is used as an input in the SketchUp [72]. Then, a 3D model is created using the OpenStudio plug-in [73]. Using EnergyPlus [74], the energy simulation is performed at 10 min intervals. 4 Results 4.1 Occupancy pattern extraction This section discusses the occupancy patterns extracted for each household using the unsupervised learning method. Fig. 9 illustrates the distribution of the number of clusters used in the k-means clustering method. The households with a larger number of clusters are expected to have more diversity in the occupancy patterns. It is observed that more than 60 % of the cases yield only two occupancy patterns, which is the largest category. It is followed by the four-cluster group, accounting for almost 27 % of the cases. The smallest group is associated to three clusters at 11.54 %. The centroids of some sample clusters are investigated in more detail to illustrate the occupancy patterns in the households. Fig. 10 demonstrates the occupancy patterns of a sample household with two clusters. The first cluster can be interpreted as a regular working schedule, in which occupants are present at home during the night and leave the building during the day from 10:00 to 19:00. In contrast, cluster 2 indicates an almost uniform occupied hours throughout the day. This pattern can be interpreted as the tendency of the occupants to say home during days off. Fig. 11 demonstrates the extracted occupancy patterns for a home with four clusters. Cluster 1 shows that the residents are likely to leave home between 9:00 and 19:00. This home remains vacant most of the day as indicated by the other clusters. Clusters 2 and 4 show that the residents are not often present at home for more than half of the day. Moreover, as can be seen in cluster 3, it is common that the home remains vacant during the entire day. 4.2 Similarity between the occupancy patterns After determining the occupancy patterns for each home, the WS metric between the test case and the train cases can be calculated to find the most similar patterns. Fig. 12 illustrates the occupancy patterns in a sample test case and in a train case that provides the highest WS (i.e., the most similar cases). Both patterns almost follow a working day profile with the occupancy ratios mostly varying in the range of 0.4\u20130.8. In both diagrams, the ratios are higher than 0.4 most of the time. As can be seen, there are also dissimilarities between the diagrams; the occupancy ratio in the train case can reach as high as 0.9 while it is always limited to 0.6 in the other one. 4.3 Transfer learning performance Fig. 13 illustrates the median values of JP, AP, and TP metrics. In this diagram, RL and TL respectively refer to the performance of a conventional DQN algorithm and the proposed TL-based DQN method. The highest impact of the TL on the system is observed on the JP metric. This method improves the median JP from −6900 to −5076, an almost 25.43 % increase in the performance. It also boosts the TP criterion, increasing from −5206 for conventional system to −4947 for using TL, which is approximately a 5 % improvement in the median accumulative rewards. However, the TL method has negligible impact on the AP of the control system. Hence, it suggests that although TL can accelerate the learning process, it might not be helpful to find a superior optimal policy. As discussed above, the main strength of the TL method is enhancing the JP, which could address the thermal discomfort caused during the learning period. Fig. 14 depicts the distribution of the DP, MTD, and MEC. As expected, the conventional agent causes higher thermal discomfort for occupants in terms of the DP and MTD. When the DQN is employed, half of the households encounter thermal discomfort more than 6 % of the entire period. However, the TL method substantially improves this metric to less than 2 % in most cases. Moreover, more than 75 % of the households experience a MTD of more than 0.13 °C with a median value of 0.19 °C when the traditional RL is implemented. However, almost all the cases experience a MTD of less than 0.1 °C, when the TL method is applied. The use of the TL method yields a median MTD of 0.06, almost 68 % improvement. The large improvement in thermal comfort is achieved at the expense of energy consumption. It is observed that the conventional DQN slightly outperforms the TL method in terms of energy consumption. The conventional DQN agent consumes a median of 2.47 kWh energy per each time interval (i.e., 30-minute periods), which is 0.08 kWh lower than that of the TL method. The difference represents an almost 3 % rise in energy consumption of households. However, regarding the substantial improvements in thermal comfort, the added energy can be considered relatively small. Fig. 15 illustrates the occurrence frequency of different values of TD for using the conventional and proposed control systems for a sample home during the first training episode. It can be seen that the occurrences of TD substantially decrease when the TL algorithm is implemented. Using the conventional DQN, the number of time intervals with temperature deviation can reaches 280 times, approximately. In contrast, the TL algorithm limits the maximum occurrences to fewer than 12 times. 5 Conclusion This study investigates the impact of transfer learning on the performance of model-free HVAC control systems based on deep reinforcement learning algorithms. The transfer learning is performed based on an inter-household similarity analysis in terms of occupancy schedules, using a k-means clustering algorithm with a DTW distance metric. The effectiveness of the proposed control system is evaluated by measuring its jumpstart, asymptotic, and total performance, compared with those of a traditional RL algorithm. The initial performance of the control system is also assessed from thermal comfort and energy viewpoints by evaluating the deviation period, mean temperature deviation, and mean energy consumption. The unsupervised learning technique demonstrates that it is possible to identify up to four main occupancy behavior types within the households under examination. Over 60 % of the samples exhibit two distinct occupancy routines, which could be interpreted as schedules for work and non-work periods. Approximately, 27 % of the households exhibit four distinct occupancy clusters. Similar to the first group, two of these patterns also show working and non-working hours while the remaining occupancy patterns indicate periods of vacancy. The TL-based control framework shows the ability to improve the performance of the RL agent in unseen test buildings. It improves the jumpstart performance and total rewards by 25 % and 5 %, respectively. However, no improvements are observed in terms of asymptotic performance. The higher jumpstart leads to considerably less thermal discomfort during the first episode of learning, in which the median of the deviation period and average temperature deviation are improved by 4 % and 68 %, respectively. The frequency of temperature deviations reduces with the application of the TL compared with using the traditional DQN method. With the conventional DQN approach, instances of temperature deviation occur roughly 280 times during different time intervals. In contrast, when employing the TL algorithm, the maximum occurrences are restricted to fewer than 12 instances, which demonstrates a substantial improvement. The promising performance of the proposed framework can provide opportunities to deal with one of the main limitations of the conventional model-free controllers, which is their poor thermal comfort provision during the initial period of training. It is worth noting that this study has a number of limitations that need further research as future directions. In the proposed control system, only occupancy data is utilized to investigate the similarity among the train and test cases. Undoubtedly, there are more factors such as weather conditions, building material, and HVAC characteristics that can be considered for the similarity analysis and performance evaluation. It is also important to note that this article considers the operative temperature as the only factor affecting thermal comfort. However, there are other critical parameters, such as humidity and wind speed, which also play a significant role in shaping thermal comfort. Considering a comprehensive thermal comfort model, as a direction for future work, could provide a better understanding of the subject and potentially lead to enhanced insights. It is also acknowledged that the developed control system works only based on the binary states of occupancy while using the occupancy level (i.e., count of occupants) can help to provide an enhanced control because of the dependency of the energy consumption on the number of occupants. This variable can also help the controller to predict future occupancy states more accurately when used as a feature. Besides, the developed strategy optimizes the indoor temperature for the whole unit. However, separate temperatures can be set for different zones, such as each bedroom. Such more granular control system could enhance the energy saving in cases where some zones often remain vacant for prolonged periods while the rest of the home is occupied.

        "dc:description": "Model-free heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) control systems have demonstrated promising potential for adjusting indoor setpoint temperature based on dynamic occupancy patterns in smart buildings. Although these control systems offer the advantage of not needing building or occupancy models, the involved trial-and-error learning process can cause considerable thermal discomfort for occupants, particularly during the initial learning period. Given the critical importance of thermal comfort, this limitation is a major barrier to the practical implementation of such systems. To address this challenge, the present study proposes a framework to enhance the learning process of the model-free HVAC controllers. Specifically, a transfer learning (TL) technique is adopted based on a similarity analysis of occupancy patterns using an unsupervised learning of occupancy profiles. This control framework leverages a k-means clustering algorithm with dynamic time warping to match the most similar households in terms of occupancy patterns within 26 residential units. The results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the performance of the HVAC control system. It enhances the jumpstart performance and total rewards by nearly 25% and 5%, respectively, compared to a conventional model-free controller. Furthermore, it reduces the deviation period and mean temperature deviation by approximately 4% and 68%, respectively. Overall, this framework presents a promising approach to enhancing the performance and practicality of model-free HVAC control systems by reducing the thermal discomfort during the learning process.",
