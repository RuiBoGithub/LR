This study presents an optimization algorithm for Model Predictive Control (MPC) of the HVAC systems in multi-family residential buildings assessing the performance of four objective functions. Implemented in C++, using the free OR-Tools optimization library, the model is formulated a Mixed Integer-Linear Programming (MILP) problem. The study analyses the results of tests conducted on a 20-dwelling block in Switzerland across various weather and occupancy conditions, resulting in a parametric study of 64 cases. The models developed for the MPC are Grey-box type for the interconnected energy systems: the building, thermal storage tanks, a heat pump, the ventilation system and PV collectors, highlighting a radiant wall heating system integrated into the building facade. The tanks and the heat pump models were informed with manufacturer data, while for the building a R3C3 thermal-electrical equivalent model was developed, calibrated using TRNSYS simulations with a root mean square error of 1.7%. Findings demonstrate how the algorithm optimizes the operation according to the desired criteria, while ensuring indoor comfort with a 15-minute time resolution. The time execution of the majority of cases is under 3 min in a low-specs computer, affirming its practical viability for real-world implementation.

To improve the energy performance of buildings, the European Union (EU) has published an Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) with the goal of achieving a carbon\u2013neutral building stock by 2050 [2]. Additionally, the EU has set a goal of generating 80 % of its electricity from Renewable Energy Sources (RES) by 2050, with electricity accounting for 50 % of total final energy demand. A significant challenge of the RES is their intermittent nature, characterized by the variability in power generation, which results in periods of inactivity and rapid fluctuations in energy output. This intermittency can undermine energy supply consistency but can be mitigated by leveraging the flexibility of the entire energy system, including buildings. According to Li et al. [3] energy flexibility refers to the ability of an energy system to adapt energy consumption in response to supply changes\u2014as essential for integrating RES effectively. This concept is gaining attention, with significant academic work focusing on enhancing building energy flexibility [4\u20138]. Traditional energy storage methods, such as water tanks, battery systems, and phase-change materials, are complemented by the thermal mass of buildings as a form of energy storage, offering potential for energy savings [9]. In addition to these conventional methods of energy storage within buildings, Chen et al. [10] highlighted that buildings can store energy in their thermal mass, which can be utilized and managed through effective control strategies. Research has shown that switching from traditional to more efficient control methods can achieve energy savings of up to 30 % for Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems. Most HVAC control methods are feedback controllers, such as Proportional\u2013Integral\u2013Derivative (PID) and Bang-Bang controllers, which are designed to maintain comfort rather than improve efficiency. This makes the optimal control of HVAC systems crucial [11]. MPC is widely acknowledged as an effective technology for enhancing operational efficiency. Extensive research supports its application in managing energy demand and boosting efficiency within building infrastructures [12\u201314]. Empirical evidence confirms that MPC facilitates high\u2018 energy efficiency, significant cost reductions, and improved indoor environmental quality [15,16]. It also significantly contributes to Demand-Side Management (DSM) and Demand Response (DR), adjusting consumption in line with grid pricing [17]. Pean et al. [18], emphasize the importance of advanced control systems, from simple rules to sophisticated MPC strategies, for utilizing building flexibility. Such optimal controller formulation involves a range of parameters aimed at boosting energy efficiency, reducing CO2 emissions, and decreasing operational costs [19]. Recent studies illustrate the versatility of MPC strategies; robust and stochastic models excel at managing forecast uncertainties, enhancing energy efficiency and thermal comfort in diverse building types [20]. Innovative applications, such as the control of Heat Pumps (HP) and air conditioning systems using EnergyPlus and OpenStudio, have markedly improved efficiency and cost-effectiveness, with some systems achieving up to 70 % reduction in peak energy demand [21,22]. Additionally, integrating MPC with market trading mechanisms has enhanced cost savings, especially in retrofitted buildings [23]. The integration of energy hubs with building systems using distributed MPC approaches, as demonstrated in the NEST project in Switzerland, highlights the scalability and efficiency of these systems in urban settings [24,25]. Empirical studies have shown substantial benefits of MPC in diverse settings. For instance, the integration of Building Integrated Photovoltaic/Thermal (BIPV/T) systems with MPC at the Varennes library in Canada achieved a 40 % reduction in energy usage, showcasing the impact of advanced control systems [26]. Additionally, complex modelling needed for predictive control in HVAC systems, emphasized by Picard et al. [27], is crucial for optimizing system responsiveness and energy efficiency. Recent advancements in MPC technology have utilized sophisticated data-driven approaches to enhance operational efficiencies. The use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for managing HPs has shown significant reductions in operational costs and optimized alignment with RES [28,29]. Furthermore, MPC\u2019s application in frequency regulation through leveraging thermal inertia and buffer storage has demonstrated enhanced system flexibility and grid stability, achieving a 13.4 % increase in energy consumption flexibility [30]. Studies on physics-informed AutoRegressive Moving Average model with eXogenous inputs (ARMAX) models have surpassed traditional machine learning methods, achieving up to 49 % energy savings in real applications [31]. Comprehensive frameworks developed by Drgoňa et al. [16] and Privara et al. [32] offer a blend of practical deployment strategies and sophisticated modelling techniques that enhance the accuracy and efficiency of building climate systems. Current research continues to push the boundaries of MPC technology with studies like those in Algarve, Portugal, where MILP-based MPC systems have shown superior performance over traditional setups in real-time energy management [33]. Further optimization of control strategies for HVAC systems using advanced modelling techniques enhances both efficiency and comfort [34]. The ongoing development of simpler, linear-form data-driven prediction models highlights a trend towards less complex yet effective MPC applications that maintain comfort and reduce energy consumption [35,36]. Notably, a 2018 study highlighted MPC's significant impact on residential buildings connected to the grid, showing a 21 % reduction in generation costs and a 17 % reduction in peak load, showcasing the extensive benefits of integrating MPC into large-scale energy networks [37]. Additionally, managing thermal and electric loads with MPC in single-family homes has demonstrated substantial reductions in operational costs, validating the robustness and adaptability of MPC systems [38]. A study on residential floor heating systems with MPC examined two buildings, various heating systems, and MPC objectives [39]. It found that prioritizing energy minimization is currently more advantageous due to low RES shares, highlighting the role of smart controllers in enhancing energy flexibility and supporting demand response. Frătean and Dobra [40] analyzed MPC objectives in two nearly zero-energy buildings (nZEBs), showing trade-offs between energy consumption and indoor comfort, favoring high inertia buildings for demand response rewards but potentially compromising comfort. Another study on nZEBs emphasized the role of control strategies. It assessed two hydraulic configurations of HPs and four control strategies, revealing potential improvements: 40 % increase in self-consumption, 20 % reduction in annual import bills, and 30 % decrease in peak grid exchanges [41]. Despite the growing interest and extensive research on MPC methodologies [12,42\u201346] their practical applications in actual buildings remains limited [47]. This text presents several real-world examples of MPC implementations. A significant application was demonstrated in a commercial office building, optimizing demand and energy costs under a time-of-use price policy [48] achieving load shifting and cost reduction but encountering issues with model mismatch and temperature deviations. Similarly, a real-world application of MPC in a Belgian office building used a computationally efficient white-box MPC with cloud-based infrastructure and first-principle physical equations, achieving substantial energy savings and comfort improvements [49]. The study highlighted the complexities of MPC implementation, including robust communication systems and high computational demands. Freund and Schmitz [50], implemented a MPC controller in a German office building using an R7C4 grey-box model. They achieved a 30 % reduction in heating energy consumption compared to rule-based control but noted elevated temperatures due to solar gains and heating system limitations. In another office-based study in Brussels, MPC managed a hybrid heat production system with HPs and a gas boiler, reducing energy costs by 34 \u2013 40 % and improving thermal comfort compared to rule-based control [51]. Challenges included controlling end-units in different zones and achieving detailed performance mapping. These savings were notable despite process simplifications, indicating potential for even greater efficiencies with more advanced models. In a three-story office building in Belgium, an advanced identification method was used to minimize prediction errors for MPC, achieving accurate temperature forecasts and reducing energy consumption by 17 %, despite challenges with faulty sensors and a lack of long-term assessment across seasons [52]. A recent study in a UK food-retail building 5 implemented a cloud-based MPC framework for HVAC systems, showing promise over a two-month simulation but limited by poor thermal performance and reliance on external data, highlighting the need for long-term monitoring to ensure sustainability and scalability for broader adoption. Lastly, Mork et al. [53] implemented a MPC methodology in a large office space using a Modelica building model calibrated over seven weeks. The MPC controlled heating and shading efficiently over a three-week period. However, the short test duration missed seasonal variations and long-term challenges, and the control was limited to heating and shading, without incorporating renewable energy sources or advanced energy storage systems. Transitioning to the educational sector, a similar MPC framework-controlled room temperature and CO2 levels in educational building, comparing Auto-Regressive with eXogenous inputs (ARX)\u2013MPC and grey-box RC-NMPC. While the ARX-MPC was more computationally efficient, the RC-NMPC offered better prediction accuracy but required more resources, achieving significant energy savings with electric use reduced by 10 \u2013 40 % and thermal use by 21 \u2013 55 % [54]. Another study in educational buildings implemented a cloud-based MPC framework for HVAC control, achieving significant energy savings and increased comfort, though the dynamic nature of these facilities, characterized by varying occupancy and usage patterns could render MPC operation sub-optimal [55]. Additionally, a remote MPC system with weather predictions applied to an educational building's heating system showed energy savings potential between 15 % and 28 %, depending on insulation level and outside temperature. This study, however, was limited by its short-term focus and specific conditions [56]. Shifting to residential applications, Wand et al. [47] conducted a field-test implementation of MPC focused on residential air-conditioning systems in China. The study validated the MPC controller's robustness, demonstrating its capability to outperform conventional rule-based controllers even under conditions of model inaccuracy. However, the study's one-month duration during the cooling season and single-apartment focus limit its generalizability. The authors also noted that occupants interacted more with the MPC controller compared to RBC methods. They also found that the current RC model struggled to maintain optimal temperature and humidity, causing more temperature fluctuations. This study introduces a sophisticated MPC framework designed to enhance energy flexibility, reduce GHG emissions, and improve economic efficiency in a multi-family residential building in Bern, Switzerland. Equipped with a HP, Photovoltaic (PV) panels, and systems for Space Heating (SH) and Domestic Hot Water (DHW) tanks, the building employs an under-explored External Radiant Heating Wall (ERHW) technology. This prefabricated system, consisting of four external walls with integrated heating loops, supplies heat uniformly across all apartments, a novel approach to energy distribution in residential buildings. This research contributes to the field of MPC applied to HVAC systems through the following key aspects: 1. Application of MPC algorithms in a large multi-residential building, addressing a gap in existing research that has predominantly focused on commercial or single-family buildings. 2. Development and validation of a simplified lumped model for a large multi-residential building with highly inertial behavior, characterized by passive design features such as a second skin with high insulation and a radiant wall (ERHW). This RC model includes an external radiant heating wall; a novel addition not documented in existing literature [57,58]. 3. Demonstration of MPC algorithm robustness through testing 64 scenarios with varying demand loads, comparing the performance among the different optimization criteria. 4. Evaluating the MPC algorithm's performance on a general-use computer indicates potential for widespread application in domestic or edge computing environments, rather than restricting it to dedicated workstations. The paper is structured as follows: In Section 2, the methodology is introduced, along with the building case study description, the modelling framework and the algorithm development. Then, in Section 3, the results of the application are presented followed by a benchmarking between different scenarios tested. Section 4 discusses the results and the limitations of the development. Finally, Section 5 presents a short summary and outlines plans for future work. 2 Methodology The introduced MPC development methodology consists of three primary procedural phases as follows: 1. Component Modelling and Validation: The initial phase involves the detailed modelling and subsequent validation of the constituent elements and behavioral characteristics of the ERHW as integrated within the target building for control purposes. 2. Optimization Criterion Formulation: In the second phase, a set of optimization criteria is systematically defined. These criteria serve as guiding metrics, facilitating the systematic assessment of the solutions' effectiveness and performance. 3. Scenario-Based Testing: The final step entails comprehensive testing across a wide range of realistic scenarios based on weather conditions and occupancy profiles. This rigorous evaluation ensures the framework\u2019s functionality under diverse conditions, providing a thorough assessment of its capabilities. Fig. 1 presents a high-level overview of the optimization algorithm structure. Its core consists of the simplified models, formulated as MILP equations which are solved by the optimization algorithm according to the computational requirements. These include the objective function criteria, weighting or computational effort allowed to the computer. As inputs, the system needs the forecasting with the occupancy profile, use of equipment and weather, as well as update the initial state of the models with the measurements on-site. As an output, it provides the optimized planning with a time-step resolution. The optimization algorithm was formulated as a MILP optimization problem using the OR-Tools engine [59] which was chosen due to its flexibility and ability to handle the complex constraints of energy management systems. The problem was solved using the SCIP solver (version 8.0.3) [60]. The experiments were executed on a conventional laptop featuring an Intel Core i5 processor operating at 2.4 GHz, running the Windows 10 - 64-bit operating system. 2.1 Demo-case description The present study focuses on a four-story multi-residential building with a total of 20 apartments and 1548 m 2 of living space located in Bern, Switzerland shown in Fig. 2 (left). The building services are: \u2022 One air-to-water HP with 50 kW capacity used interchangeably for SH and DHW purposes. \u2022 One thermal storage tank of 3.6 m 3 for the centralized DHW systems and one buffer tank of 1 m 3 for SH purposes. \u2022 A centralized ventilation system operating according to the CO2 concentration of the exhaust air. \u2022 A PV system with a peak power of 90 kWp . Approximately 535 m 2 of PV modules of Copper Indium Selenide (CIS) technology are installed: 280 m 2 in the four facades and 247 m 2 on the rooftop with 10° of inclination. \u2022 On the south-facing building façade, a feature known as \u201cWinter Garden\u201d (WG), analogous to a glass enclosed balcony, has been incorporated to harness solar radiation, thereby establishing a buffer zone between the building and the external environment, consequently fostering a greenhouse effect. \u2022 Solar shading automatic control based on incident radiation and time schedule, mostly operating during summer. \u2022 The ERHW system: a prefabricated system with heating loops in four external walls, heating all 20 apartments. The installation procedure commenced with the incorporation of heating loops into the existing façades, followed by the application of insulation. The final step involved adding a finishing layer to these façades, completing the process. Additionally, auxiliary radiators in each apartment provide backup heating to meet occupant comfort requirements. Fig. 2 (right) shows the layout of the piping distribution of the ERHW applied on one of the building facades. 2.2 Site modelling The optimization algorithm includes the models of the building, HVAC components, DHW system, and PV field. The building comprises three thermal states (indoor air, walls, and mass) and receives external inputs like weather conditions and internal gains (occupancy, infiltration, lighting, and appliances) which are calculated and introduced to the optimization algorithm. The controllable inputs are the thermal power from the SH tank or HP to the ERHW \u2013 Active Layer (AL) and from the HP to the DHW tank. The decision regarding the HP operation, whether to supply the DHW tank or the SH distribution system, as well as the electric power exported or imported from the grid, is made by the optimization algorithm. This decision results in the allocation of thermal power, denoted as Q HP - D H W T a n k , Q HP - A L , and Q HP - S H T a n k , either to the storage tanks or directly to the AL, as well as the. The MPC algorithm has the capability to determine the allocation of heat from the HP to the DHW tank, the SH tank, or directly to the AL. When the SH system is the target, the HP has the capacity to provide thermal energy to both the SH tank and the AL simultaneously, or selectively to either of these components. It is worth noting that the electrical power consumption of the compressor is contingent on the amount of heat dispatched and contributes to the thermal output of the system. Fig. 3 presents a high-level interconnection of the various components. The following sections present the simplified models for each component, expressed as the equations for a specific moment t in time. 2.2.1 Building R3C3 model Grey-box electric circuit resembling Resistance-Capacitance (RC) models [18], that consist of a set of differential equation describing the dynamics of the system in continuous time and a set of discrete time measurement equations, allow incorporation of prior physical knowledge in the identification of their parameters. Differential equations and matrix form (1) C int · T ̇ t int = - 1 R int · T t int - T t W - 1 R ext · T t int - T t a m b _ W G + Q t (2) C W · T ̇ t W = 1 R int · T t int - T t W - 1 R W · T t W - T t AL + g A · I t r (3) C AL · T ̇ t AL = 1 R W · T t W - T t AL + Q t AL Q t = Q t inf + Q t vent + Q t IG Q t AL = Q t SCT + Q t H P _ A L The building model uses three temperature states (R3C3) and their differential equations are as presented in Eq. (1), (2) and (3). The first state, indoor air ( T t int ), is a weighted averaging lumped temperature based on room sizes of the building, which is sufficient for MPC applications as shown for example in De Coninck et al. [62], where the heating power is managed at a building level. T t W are the lumped thermal masses of walls and slabs, and T t AL is the lumped the ERHW [63]. R int denotes the heat transfer between the building envelope and indoor air C int represents the heat capacity of the indoor zone. R W represents the fabric's thermal resistance, while C W its thermal inertia. R ext accounts for heat transfer between the building interior and exterior, and C AL is the thermal capacity of the ERHW. The term gA denotes the solar aperture, the fraction of global solar radiation entering the indoor space, and I t r is the incident global solar radiation. The Q term includes the heat loads originating from ventilation, infiltration, occupancy, illumination and domestic appliances. Fig. 4 shows the equivalent electrical circuit of the building's simplified RC model. Within the thermal model, T t ambWG is the outdoor temperature which is determined through a weighted averaging process involving T t amb (ambient air temperature) and T t WG (temperature within the WG). The weights are proportional to the surface area of the façade in contact with the WG ( A WG ) and the surface area exposed to the ambient air ( A amb ) , as exemplified in Equation (4). The temperature of the WG is crucial for the simplified model and is calculated from Eq. (5), where Ir ¯ is the daily accumulated solar radiation. Coefficients β 0 - β 5 were adjusted with a linear regression to data from TRNSYS simulations for T t WG .

(6). Where matrixes A and B are made of RC parameters in the form of Eq. (7) and Eq. (8).

In this procedure, the algorithm finds the parameters which minimize the estimation error with data from a TRNSYS model previously developed. These data were generated over a 10-day period simulation in January. The identified parameters shown in Table 1 yielded the minimum estimation error with a Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) estimation of 1.70 % for T int , 1.43 % for T W and 3.78 % for T AL . 2.2.2 Heat Pump simplified model The Coefficient of Performance (COP) and Capacity (CAP) of the HP are contingent upon the source temperature, specifically the T t amb , and the HP supply temperatures required for the production of water T sup SH , or T sup DHW (depending upon the mode). The installation is designed to operate at 55 °C for DHW, and 35 °C for SH generation. Depending on the mode of the HP, SH or DHW, the HP electric power is calculated according to Equation (15) and COP and CAP to Equations (13) and (14). The coefficients CO P 0 , CO P 1 and CO P 2 , and CA P 0 , CA P 1 and CA P 2 , were derived from the manufacturer's provided chart and are presented in Table 2 as a function of T t amb and T sup SH / D W H . (13) CO P t = C O P 0 + C O P 1 · T t amb + C O P 2 · T sup SH / D W H (14) CA P t = C A P 0 + C A P 1 · T t amb + C A P 2 · T sup SH / D H W (15) P HP = Q t HP CO P t The adjustment of the CAP equation has a R2 of 0.9901 and a RMSE of 0.3493 kW, and the COP has a a R2 of 0.9598 and a RMSE of 0.2282. 2.2.3 Tanks RC simplified models The tanks are modelled using grey-box type RC circuits, with one single state, represented with the differential equation from Eq. (16) and (17). These equations can be expressed in a matrix form and discretized similarly to the building model R3C3. (16) C SHtank · T ̇ SHtank = 1 R SHTank · T SHtank - T a m b _ W G + Q HP - S H T a n k - Q SHTank - A L (17) C DHWtank · T ̇ DHWtank = 1 R DHWTank · T DHWtank - T a m b _ W G + Q HP - D H W T a n k - Q DHWTank - A L The thermal properties of the DHW and SH storage tanks are determined by their water-based thermal capacity and their thermal resistance to the surrounding environment, reflective of their insulation levels and were obtained by the manufacturer\u2019s datasheet. In this context, the environmental zone is conceptually modelled as a virtual space positioned between the indoor and outdoor environments, with its temperature approximated as the mean of T t int and T t amb (representing a semi-outdoor space in the building basement). The controllable variables include the thermal power supplied by the HP to the tanks ( Q HP - D H W T a n k , Q HP - S H T a n k ), as well as the thermal power drawn from the SH Tank to heat the building ( Q SHTank - A L ). In contrast, the DHW demand ( Q DHWload ) is instantaneous and beyond control. Consequently, it is considered a boundary condition and forecasted using standard DHW tapping profiles. The resistance and capacitance values utilized for simulating the two tanks are presented in Table 3 and have been sourced from the manufacturer's datasheet. 2.2.4 Ventilation system The ventilation system includes a Heat Exchanger (HX) to recover waste heat. For the sake of model simplification, it is assumed that temperature returning from inside the building ( T 21 ) remains constant at the predetermined interior setpoint, 21 °C. This assumption allows for the computation of the outlet conditions of the heat exchanger. The Q vent (heat transfer rate) and the HX capacity are treated as exogenous factors as they are not integral to the optimization problem. The calculation of the heat supplied by the ventilation unit at any given time is determined using Equation (18), where ε represents the effectiveness of the HX, m t the ventilation mass flowrate [ k g / s ] at time t and C p the thermal capacity [ k W / K ] of air on both sides. (18) Q t vent = 1 - ε ∙ m t ∙ C p ∙ ( T 21 - T t amb ) 2.2.5 PV system simplified model The electric power output, denoted as P t PV , is a function constructed based on considerations of the PV cell temperature, ambient temperature, and the total horizontal solar irradiation. The installed panels are monocrystalline CIS type, and the P t PV calculation was based on the model provided by the PVGIS calculation methods [64]. The output of this model is used as a boundary condition of the optimization problem since no decision can be made about its operation. 2.2.6 Electric balance The electrical infrastructure within the building maintains a bidirectional connection with the electricity grid, allowing for a two-way exchange of electrical energy. This implies that the MPC algorithm possesses the capability to both procure energy from the grid and supply excess energy back into the grid. The electric balance is shown in Equation (19). For each time instant t, the variables are as follows: P t PV (PV generation power), P t app (appliances power usage), P t exp (residual PV power exported to the grid), P t imp (imported grid power), P t HP - S H and P t HP - D H W (HP power for SH and DHW systems). (19) P t PV - P t app = P t exp - P t imp + P t HP - S H + P t HP - D H W 2.3 Optimization algorithm The optimization algorithm is formulated in order to regulate the thermal conditions within the building, harnessing the adaptability of the versatile HP load and PV used energy. The model itself has been elaborated in section 2.2, while the constraints and the objective function are elucidated in the subsequent subsections. These models are vital for predicting how the building behaves dynamically under control [36,65]. The equations need to be formulated as constraints for each instant ( k ) during the optimization period, with the intervals between these instances corresponding to the simulation's time-step from 1 to M, where M is the final instant. It results in several equations equal to M x number of models. Additionally, the differential equations must be integrated over the time-step ( Δ t ) discrete periods. The discretization time-step is chosen as 15 min: In this way the operating setpoints will be maintained at least for this duration, reflecting the minimum time up or down usually set in the typical controllers for HPs and radiant systems. Furthermore, a time step of 15 min captures the dynamics of the building with sufficient accuracy and represents a satisfactory trade-off [43]. 2.3.1 Constraints on the inputs The inputs constitute the model variables designated as decision variables, over which the algorithm exercises freedom. The chosen ranges that correspond to the manufacturer\u2019s specifications are: \u2022 Q k HP - D H W T a n k ∈ 0 , C A P k W \u2022 Q k HP - S H T a n k ∈ 0 , C A P k W \u2022 Q k HP - A L ∈ 0 , 40 k W \u2022 Q k SHTank - A L ∈ 0 , 40 k W \u2022 P k exp ∈ R + , k W \u2022 P k imp ∈ R + , k W \u2022 ε k int ∈ R + , ° C \u2022 ε k SH ∈ R + , ° C \u2022 ε k DHW ∈ R + , ° C To enable precise control within the predictive algorithm, we opted for continuous variables to represent the heat transfer: Q k HP - D H W T a n k and Q k HP - S H T a n k are limited by the HP\u2019s capacity (CAP); Q k HP - A L and Q k SHTank - A L are limited by the distribution capacity of the installation, estimated as 40 kW; and P k exp and P k imp is the electric power exported/imported from the grid. To facilitate the transition from SH to DHW production mode, binary variables X k SH and X k DHW were introduced, assigned values of 1 when their respective mode is active and 0 otherwise. \u2022 X k SH ∈ N [ 0 , 1 ] \u2022 X k DHW ∈ N [ 0 , 1 ] Given the HP's capability to operate solely in one mode at any given instant (k), the binary variables were subjected to the constraint from Equation (20). (20) X k SH + X k DHW ≤ 1 Such binary variables also enable to limit the heating power Q to a certain range, when the HP is turned on. The introduction of these binary variables fundamentally alters the nature of the control problem, necessitating the use of MILP rather than the simpler Linear Programming (LP) techniques for problem resolution [66]. 2.3.2 Constraints of the models The equations of the models described in section 2.2 are formulated as constraints of a MILP optimization problem, as presented in the following equations (21)\u2013(27). (21) B u i l d i n g R 3 C 3 T k + 1 int T k + 1 W T k + 1 AL = A d · T k int T k W T k AL + B d · Q k I k r T k amb W G Q k AL (22) T a n k s R 1 C 1 T k + 1 DHW T k + 1 SCT = Ad tanks · T k DHW T k SCT + Bd tanks · T k amb W G T 21 Q k HP - D H W Q k DHWload Q k HP - S C T Q k SCT - A L (23) H P D H W - P o w e r P k HP - D H W · COP k DHW = Q k HP - D H W (24) H P S H - P o w e r P k HP - S C · COP k SC = Q k HP - A L + Q k HP - S C T (25) H P - D i s t r i b u t i o n c a p a c i t y Q k HP - S C T + Q k HP - A L ≤ X k SC · C k HP , S C (26) H P - B i n a r y o p e r a t i o n D H W / S H Q k HP - D H W ≤ X k DHW · C k HP , D W H (27) E l e c t r i c b a l a n c e P k PV - P k app = P k exp - P k imp + P k HP - S C + P k HP - D H W 2.3.3 Constraints on the outputs The outputs encompass the variables employed for setting and applying the specified setpoints and ensure occupant comfort. The internal temperature must remain above 21 °C and below 23 °C during the heating season. Slack variables ε k int , ε k SH and ε k DHW take on a value of zero, however, they allow the algorithm to deviate from the setpoints when there is no other mathematical solution to the problem, as described in Section 2.3.4. \u2022 T k int + ε k int ≥ 21 ° C \u2022 T k int - ε k int ≤ 23 ° C The SH tank setpoint is in the range of 35 °C to 55 °C, while the DHW tank is from 45 °C to 55 °C as it was imposed by the building\u2019s occupants. \u2022 T k SHTank + ε k SH ≥ 35 ° C \u2022 T k SHTank - ε k SH ≤ 55 ° C \u2022 T k DHWTank + ε k DHW ≥ 45 ° C \u2022 T k DHWTank - ε k DHW ≤ 55 ° C 2.3.4 Objective functions \u2013 tested MPC configurations The MPC algorithm intends to optimize (minimize/maximize) a certain objective over a prediction horizon. The purpose of this optimization problem is to generate an optimal plan for the electrical and thermal actions of the system over a given time horizon. In this application, four optimization criteria have been developed as optimization functions. Slack term: all objective functions share the slack term J ε . In principle ε = 0 but exceptionally the temperature is allowed to trespass the constraints ( ε > 0 ). The associated cost of breaching these boundaries is determined by the variable w , with specific values set as follows: w SH = w DHW = 1 · 10 6 ; w int = 3.6 · 10 6 . This value is estimated to be higher than the energy cost to increase the air temperature of the building or the tanks by 1 °C. This precaution is implemented to ensure such temperature exceedance only occurs in situations where there is no other viable mathematical solution, as depicted in Equation (28) using variables introduced in Section 2.3.2. (28) J ε = ∑ k = 0 M w DHW · ε k DHW + w SH · ε k SH + w int · ε k int Objective function (SC) \u2013 Self-Consumption maximization: this metric optimizes the use of locally generated PV energy, defined as the net difference between exported and imported grid energy in Equation (29). (29) J SC = m i n ∑ k = 0 M P k exp - P k imp + J ε Objective function (CO2) \u2013 CO2 emissions minimization: this metric calculates economic cost from grid imported energy using a per kWh emissions factor hourly profile ( f k C O 2 ) [ k g eqC O 2 / kWh ] as shown in Equation (30). (30) J C O 2 = m i n ∑ i = 0 M P k imp Â · f k C O 2 + J ε Objective function (Cost) − Economic cost minimization: this metric calculates the operational electricity costs considering grid imported/exported energy, according to electricity market hourly price ( C k buy , C k sell ) [\u20ac/kWh] as shown in Equation (31). (31) J cost = min ∑ i = 0 M P k imp · C k buy - P k exp · C k sell + J ε Objective function (FE) \u2013 Final Energy use minimization: this metric calculates the building's energy consumption in terms of SH and DHW [kWh] as shown in Equation (32). (32) J FE = min ∑ i = 0 M P k HP - D H W + P k HP - S H + J ε 2.4 Testing scenarios design The testing scenarios were obtained as the combination of the following parameters: the weather, the optimization horizon (24 or 72 h), occupant activity (high or low), and optimization criteria. The average ambient temperature during this period, referred to as T amb , is tested under conditions of both high and low temperatures. Similarly, the accumulated horizontal solar irradiation, denoted as I r , is evaluated for scenarios of high and low irradiation. The combination of T amb and I r resulted in the selection of four weather periods in the months of February, April, September, and October, which are represented in Fig. 5 . The occupancy profile, indicating the level of occupants' activity including metabolism, appliances, and lighting use, is assessed for high and low occupancy levels. Finally, all the combinations of the mentioned parameters are tested for the four optimization criteria: Self-Consumption, CO2 emissions, Cost, and Final Energy. This resulted in the creation of 64 unique test scenarios. Occupancy patterns were aligned with Swiss National Norm SIA 2024 [67]. They indicate presence during night, morning, dinner, and afternoon, with peak internal gains from occupancy reaching 2.3 W / m 2 and from domestic equipment 2.3 W / m 2 . DHW data, sourced from monitored Swiss multifamily homes [68], was translated to thermal demand in kW at a 45 °C supply temperature, diverging from periodic schedule methodologies. The Typical Meteorological Year (TMY) for Bern, Switzerland, was sourced according to SIA 2028 [69] standardizing climate data for building physics, energy, and engineering calculations. 3 Results 3.1 Total results summary Given the abundance of results, they are summarized in Fig. 6 and in Table A1 in a statistical overview for all 64 cases. The data comprises all weather periods, occupancy profiles, and optimization time-horizons. The graphical presentation in Fig. 6 facilitates a clear observation of the effects associated with each criterion on the outcomes. Notably, each indicator is optimized according to its corresponding criterion. For instance, the Final Energy indicator yields similar results for both FE and Cost criteria since both aim to minimize the imported energy from the grid. Meanwhile, the CO2 emissions indicator is minimized by the CO2 criterion, and the cost indicator is minimized primarily by the Cost criterion, followed by CO2 and FE, as all these criteria focus on minimizing imported energy. Remarkably, the SC criterion attains the highest self-consumption results, presenting a significant difference compared to other criteria. 3.2 Computational time consumption The computation time is critically evaluated in relation to the MPC's design, which necessitates execution within a 15-minute cycle. Ensuring that the computational time remains below this limit is crucial for the practical implementation of the MPC. Fig. 7 and Table A2 illustrate that most cases are completed in less than 30 s. However, in some cases (around 25 % of them), as the energy demand increased, the algorithm required progressively more time to reach the optimal solution. It was also observed that narrowing the setpoints increased the processing time. It is important to mention that in only two experiments the computational time did exceed the 15-minute threshold. For future implementation in an MPC system, a limiting condition should be included in the algorithm to end the optimization and select with the best solution found in less than 15 min. 3.3 Detailed results example This section offers insights into the performance and interactions of each element within the overall system. The case December + Low Occupancy + 72-hour horizon is selected as the most interesting for analysis, attributed to its elevated energy demand resulting from specific weather conditions. The highest demand has proven to be the most difficult optimization problem for the algorithm in terms of computational time, and the variety of weather of this case (a good proportion of cloudy and sunny hours) showcases the model\u2019s behavior under different boundary conditions. Fig. 8 details the outcomes of applying the CO2 criterion for all system components, including the building, the storage tanks, the HP, and electric balance. It can be seen that during the initial 22 h, the HP operates at full capacity, independent of PV availability or the efficiency of the HP. This is driven by boundary conditions and the HP capacity, leaving no alternative but to allow T int to fall below the setpoint initially. These deviations are absorbed by the slack variable ε int . In these conditions, the HP works at maximum capacity and achieves the setpoint after 15 h. However, it continues operating until 22 h, elevating T AL above 39 °C, to prevent T int from falling below the setpoint until internal gains contribute to its rise. Subsequently, when PV resources are available, the HP operates again to maintain T int above the setpoint for the remainder of the time horizon. This optimization also operates the HP so the demand for the DHW is satisfied. Regarding the tanks\u2019 operation, it is noteworthy that in this scenario, the SH tank is not utilized as part of the optimization strategy. Instead, the algorithm uses the thermal inertia of the building. This preference may stem from the limited capacity of the tank of 1 m 3 . In a high-demand scenario like this, the constrained capacity renders the tank less useful within the optimization strategy. On the other hand, the DHW tank is utilized in this scenario. With a capacity of 3.6 m 3 , it is evident that its contribution to the flexibility of the DHW production is limited, as it is discharged within one or two time-steps. The total final energy consumption reached 389.19 kWh , resulting in equivalent emissions totaling 94.63 kg ∙ CO 2 . Additionally, the operational cost of −43.36 \u20ac, is attributed to the export of excess energy to the grid. The scenario took 2 min and 49 s to complete. 3.4 Optimization criteria comparison Next, we compare the application of the four possible optimization criteria to the December scenario as in previous section. Fig. 9 presents a comparative analysis of the HP operation profile, and Fig. 10 and Table A3 compare the indicators obtained. Under the current experimental conditions, after the first day, most of the HP consumption can be allocated during PV generation, apart from the DHW demand peak which cannot be stored due to the limited capacity of the tank. An analysis of the different criteria reveals that they operate almost identically during the first day. After the first day, the SC and CO2 criteria utilize the HP capacity to exploit the PV production, whereas the Cost and Final Energy criteria display energy consumption only for DHW during the second and third day. It is evident that the algorithm achieves the best performance according to the selected criteria. The SC criterion yields the highest SC percentage and Final-Energy consumption indicators, while all the Cost indicators suggest positive values, meaning more exported energy than imported. This is because I r is low and the demand high. Among the criteria, the Cost criterion achieves the highest revenue by exporting energy, while the SC criterion generates the lowest revenue, due to its greater energy consumption. 4 Discussion 4.1 Strategies adopted by the optimizer The optimizer effectively manages energy resources, with an initial reliance on the HP, to ensure indoor temperatures remain above the 21 °C setpoint. The scenario highlights the algorithm\u2019s ability to balance indoor comfort with emission reduction, showcasing an intricate interplay between the HP, grid energy, and PV production. The HP plays a central role during the initial phase when PV production is absent. Subsequently, the optimizer schedules HP operation during periods of PV production. Occasional spikes in DHW demand disrupt this optimization, necessitating HP operation to meet these requirements and recharge the tanks. The system's capability to stabilize indoor temperatures effectively, leveraging thermal mass and reducing reliance on the HP, is evident in this scenario. On the other hand, the tanks were sized as a transition element (1 m 3 for SH and 3.6 m 3 for DHW) to smoothen the performance of the HP, and therefore, in all the obtained results, the tanks have a small part of the optimization strategy. Generally, it was merely limited to maintaining them at the set point while compensating for thermal losses to the environment. A sensitivity analysis of the size of the tank compared to the power of the HP could show the proportion when the system could start involving the tanks in the optimization strategy as storage systems. 4.2 Use of linear models In our analysis, the models were formulated as linear equations. To avoid non-linearities, power variables are the primary independent (decision) variables, rather than temperature variables. For instance, the calculation of ventilation gains necessitated the estimation of the return temperature based on the indoor air setpoint value. Similarly, in the case of the HP, we simplified the model by assuming a constant supply temperature, with the decision variable focused solely on the thermal power. Despite the inherent error introduced by these estimations in adapting the equations to a linear framework, the impact on algorithm performance remains minimal and does not compromise its effectiveness. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that employing a non-linear solver could potentially enhance accuracy, but the feasibility of such an approach remains uncertain. The implementation of a non-linear solver might incur an unknown computational effort and time consumption, considerations that merit further exploration. 5 Conclusion In this study, we designed and implemented an optimization algorithm for MPC applications in residential buildings equipped with RES, including HP, PV panels, and hot water storage tanks. The developed optimization algorithm controls the building's energy over a finite time horizon to minimize a predefined objective function. It targets the optimization of electrical and thermal actions based on criteria such as PV self-consumption, CO2 emissions, operational costs, and total energy consumption. An essential part of the work involved developing and validating simplified linear models for the system components, especially these developed ad-hoc for the building (R3C3) and the ERHW whereas, despite the RC models being widely applied to buildings, there were not found cases involving radiant walls. The models were formulated as a MILP problem implemented in C++ and using OR-Tools, a free optimization library, implying the use of binary variables for the HP modes and heat distribution. This comprehensive modelling allowed us to conduct 64 diverse scenarios, covering a wide range of potential challenges. The results highlight the optimizer\u2019s adaptability in prioritizing system components based on their instantaneous efficiency, continually optimizing operations to meet setpoints, and effectively managing energy storage and self-consumption of onsite renewable energy. For instance, the algorithm operated the ERHW and stored heat in the thermal masses of the building when PV was producing, instead of consuming power when indoor temperature would reach the lower setpoint, thus preventing to consume energy from the grid. We observed that the computational time of the experiments increased when the heating/cooling demand was higher. The experiments were conducted in a low-specs computer, and the execution time remained under 30 s in most of the cases, reaching the 3 min as the energy demand grew higher. Nevertheless, the execution time is lower than the control loop update frequency (<15 min), without compromising the performance of optimization algorithm over the controlled building. A low computational-demand algorithm can be implemented in remote systems, edge computing or even in domestic applications. This MPC algorithm is a precise, flexible technology which can optimize the operation of complex residential buildings with RES and centralized HVAC, elaborating optimized plans with 15 min resolution, and according to different criteria, such as minimizing energy costs, maximizing self-consumption, or minimizing carbon emissions. Future research about this work will cover the following aspects: \u2022 The use of multi-criteria optimization by using combination of multiple objective functions. \u2022 The incorporation of a non-linear solving engine could accommodate more intricate models, such as those for ventilation and HP performance, enabling a higher level of modelling precision. \u2022 Investigate to which extent the ratio of the size of the tank versus the power of the HP involves the storage tanks in the optimization strategy. \u2022 The algorithm should be tested in a simulation environment connected to a virtual demo building. This would validate its functionality as an MPC across different scenarios and compare it with standard rule-based controls. \u2022 Finally, a remote implementation of the MPC through a communication platform, thereby expanding its final utility as cloud-based application.

        "dc:description": "This study presents an optimization algorithm for Model Predictive Control (MPC) of the HVAC systems in multi-family residential buildings assessing the performance of four objective functions. Implemented in C++, using the free OR-Tools optimization library, the model is formulated a Mixed Integer-Linear Programming (MILP) problem. The study analyses the results of tests conducted on a 20-dwelling block in Switzerland across various weather and occupancy conditions, resulting in a parametric study of 64 cases. The models developed for the MPC are Grey-box type for the interconnected energy systems: the building, thermal storage tanks, a heat pump, the ventilation system and PV collectors, highlighting a radiant wall heating system integrated into the building facade. The tanks and the heat pump models were informed with manufacturer data, while for the building a R3C3 thermal-electrical equivalent model was developed, calibrated using TRNSYS simulations with a root mean square error of 1.7%. Findings demonstrate how the algorithm optimizes the operation according to the desired criteria, while ensuring indoor comfort with a 15-minute time resolution. The time execution of the majority of cases is under 3 min in a low-specs computer, affirming its practical viability for real-world implementation.",
