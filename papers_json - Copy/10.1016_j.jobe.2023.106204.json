Centralized optimization approaches to trade-off between comfort, energy and carbon emissions are widely adopted in the control of building heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems. However, the high computational complexity in each control horizon, single point of failure risks, and the limited number of zones to control make the centralized approach unattractive. Unlike centralized controls, multi-agent control (MAC) systems are flexible and modular. This paper proposes a scalable multi-agent based distributed approach for optimized control of a multi-zone smart building based on a set of local agents which represent individual zones in the building, coordinated by a central agent. For each control horizon, the coordinator minimizes the overall carbon emissions and assigns an individual energy budget to each local agent. Each local agent minimizes the discomfort in its zone while respecting the energy budget assigned by the coordinator. We propose a heuristic search based on a genetic algorithm to find the optimized control sequences in each zone, and formulate an integer linear programming (ILP) model for the coordinator problem which can be solved using an ILP solver. For a representative winter test day, the proposed methodology gave an energy savings of 8.8% and reduced the carbon footprint by 23.4%.

From which, the heating, cooling, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems are responsible for more than 50% of the energy consumed in commercial buildings [2] and is an important producer of CO 2 emissions [3]. Improving the HVAC operation contributes to a sustainable future while reducing the carbon footprint of the building and is a strategy requiring very little capital expenditure. In general, centralized control methods achieve the best performance when control decisions are made using all available information [4]. However, many limitations make a centralized control no longer practical. First, the optimization strategies in the centralized control system can take very long time to find the optimal control decisions, which is a challenge for systems with a short period of operation [5]. A centralized control framework can be computationally expensive for large scale optimization when applied to buildings with a large number of zones, equipped by complex distribution system and influenced by various factors. Compared to a centralized method, a multi-agent control (MAC) approach can potentially be more flexible and scalable [6]. However, implementing real-time optimal control strategies for multi-zone HVAC systems using multi-agent based distributed optimization methods can be challenging [7,8]. Distributed optimal controls require distributed optimization methods for which convergence is not always guaranteed [9]. Moreover, the optimization models proposed in previous work are limited to energy efficiency and discomfort minimization [10]. More essential costs must be considered in the MAC optimization problem, such as reducing the carbon footprint. In this paper, we propose a model predictive control (MPC) based multi-agent control framework allowing the optimal operation of HVAC system. The MAC framework is composed by a number of agents and one coordinator. Each agent is responsible for a specific zone which may have a different size and different power requirement. Each agent is formulated as MPC-based optimization problem and solves a local optimal control problem that minimizes discomfort during the control horizon N p . The coordinator\u2019s role is to entrust an individual power budget to each agent while minimizing carbon emissions. This paper extends our prior work in [11] where a centralized-based control approach has been proposed to optimally control the HVAC system in smart buildings with subject to minimal energy consumption. Unlike our prior work, in this paper, we propose a distributed control approach that considers carbon emission reduction in addition to energy and discomfort. Additionally, in this paper, we present more scalable case studies implemented using the Modelica simulator [12]. A comparison between the centralized approach proposed in [11] and the proposed distributed approaches is also provided in this paper. The contributions of this paper are: (1) modeling a scalable multi-agent control system formulated as MPC-based optimization problems for multi-zone buildings; (2) modeling carbon emission cost by considering the marginal emissions factor (MEF) rate that categorizes the footprint of the power grid and minimizing it in the coordinator optimization model; and, (3) carrying out extensive simulations using Modelica to validate the proposed MAC approach. This paper is structured as follows: Section 2 summarizes the prior work related to our research. Section 3 describes the use case and the description of the multi-agent framework. Section 4 details the proposed multi-agent model and describes the control algorithm. Section 5 presents the validation methodology and baselines. Section 6 provides a discussion of the experimental results and compares the performance of the proposed models. Finally, conclusions are summarized and future horizons are presented. 2 Related work To optimize HVAC control, centralized MPC-based approaches which are solved using different optimization algorithms, for instance, mixed-integer linear programming (MILP), mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP), nonlinear programming algorithm (NLP) and evolutionary algorithms like genetic algorithms (GA), have obtained more attention in recent years [13,14]. Dullinger et al. [15] developed a centralized predictive HVAC controller based on a MILP approach. The proposed control system is based on two levels of operation. On the upper level, the global thermal system performance and the HVAC modes are controlled using a long prediction horizon to take care of the slow dynamics of the plant. Then, on the lower level, the system operation is optimized with a shorter horizon that corrected possible prediction deviations without increasing the computation time. Similarly, Tarragona et al. [16] presented a two level centralized MPC control strategy to improve the operation of a space-heating system coupled with renewable resources. The proposed control approach is formulated as an MINLP. These double levels of control helped the system to find the optimal solution with less computation time. Raman et al. [17] designed an NLP-based centralized control approach incorporating humidity and latent heat in the MPC optimization problem for energy-efficient HVAC control. Song et al. [14] proposed a GA-based centralized control method to optimize the configuration of a combined cooling, heating and power (CCHP) plant. Mtibaa et al. [11] proposed an online centralized data-driven control framework based on a GA allowing the optimal operation of the HVAC system and has been experimentally validated in a multi-zone retail building. A centralized MPC is developed in [18] aimed at occupant comfort and energy efficiency with variable cost rates. The authors obtained a reduction of 13% in the energy cost with the proposed control strategy compared to a rule-based approach. Different centralized control frameworks have been proposed in the literature [11,16]. However, for large-scale buildings, it is not practical to calculate control actions in this manner due to time limitations, a single point of failure risks, and the limited number of zones to control. Compared with centralized control-based methods, MAC systems are more flexible and scalable [6]. MAC system, has lately caught significant attention for HVAC control systems. Su and Wang [19] designed an agent-based distributed optimal control approach for multi-zone building. The authors studied different implementation challenges including convergence rate, computation complexities and computation loads. Results showed that the proposed control had a low computation load and a high convergence rate. Li et al. [20] developed a three-layered multi-agent system based optimal control method using the chaotic search particle swarm optimization. The results demonstrated that the proposed control solution could reduce the operating cost by 1.84%. MPC has become a common choice for distributed implementation [4]. Pertzborn [21] adopted an MPC and distributed optimization by using the distributed agents for optimal operation of a central chilling system combined with an ice-storage system. The distributed models divided the computational load between multiple local models and optimizations, providing an effective global control policy for the entire operating system. Joe et al. [22] studied a distributed MPC scheme and has demonstrated a high potential of reducing energy consumption by up to 27% within the cooling season. A real-time optimal control method is developed in [23] to solve the optimization problem in a distributed manner and find the proper trade-off between maintaining thermal comfort and indoor air quality as well as minimizing energy use. Li and Wang [24] designed a multi-agent based hierarchical distributed approach for the optimal control of multi-zone ventilation systems to improve indoor air quality by regulating the operation of the primary air-handling units. A centralized multi-objective optimization scheme was formulated and decomposed into different simpler distributed sub-schemes. In this way, complex control optimization problems can be solved collectively by multiple agents. Such studies [21,24] demonstrate the effectiveness of using distributed optimal control approaches to improve the energy efficiency of HVAC systems. However, the scalability of the proposed distributed control systems can be improved. Furthermore, the implementation of optimal control strategies for multi-zone HVAC systems using multi-agent based distributed optimization approaches is a challenging research direction. Moreover, the optimization models proposed in previous work are limited to energy efficiency and discomfort minimization. The carbon footprint is an essential factor to consider in the optimization problem. Vogler-Finck et al. used MPC to control and optimize multi-zone operation [25]. The results show that carbon footprint and energy optimization are relevant objectives for predictive control, while price optimization is secondary. Carbon emission reduction is also considered in [26], in which the authors proposed an economic model predictive control (E-MPC) scheme for space heating operation. Simulation results showed that E-MPC increases cost savings by up to 6% and CO 2 emissions by up to 3%. In [27], MEF is used instead of the average emissions of the electrical grid. The MEF is also used in [3], in which an MPC controller has been developed and tested within a co-simulation framework which combines an optimization approach with a dynamic building simulation tool. Their proposed solution achieves a marginal emissions saving in the range of 19%\u201329%. The aforementioned approaches have successfully reduced carbon emissions, however they do not use a multi-agent data-driven MPC approach. In this paper, a multi-agent control framework named MAC is proposed to optimize operations of HVAC system. Our approach relies on data-driven MPC control. 3 System description 3.1 Building description In this paper, we consider a multi-zone retail building equipped with a rooftop unit (RTU). The building has five zones equipped each with a RTU and controlled by a separate thermostat. Each RTU contains a fan with two heating and two cooling stages as described in Fig. 1. We assume a constant fan flow-rate and it is actuated either ON or OFF. There is significant thermal coupling between all zones since there are no walls between them. Given a zone i , it is controlled by a vector u i ˆ including five control parameters u ˆ c 1 i , u ˆ c 2 i , u ˆ f i , u ˆ h 1 i and u ˆ h 2 i which represent cooling stage 1, cooling stage 2, fan ventilation stage, heating stage 1 and heating stage 2. The control signal is binary: 0 means OFF and 1 means ON. The range of possible combinations of control operations is six, as shown in Table 1. The first stage of either heating or cooling modes can be activated alone, however the second stage requires the first to be ON. The fan can run independently but needs to be ON whenever the heating or cooling system is ON. The energy efficiency of a building can be achieved by orchestrating the sequence of control signals across the different units over a time horizon while respecting system and comfort constraints. 3.2 Multi-agent control system description The multi-agent control system is described in Fig. 2, and is a distributed control decision process based on two main entities: \u2022 Local agent: each local agent is an independent control decision maker who represents each RTU or separated zone in the building. There are as many agents as RTUs. An agent is in charge of its own local control parameters decision and responsible for generating a local optimal decision regarding some constraints. Moreover, the agents compete for global optimality at each time cycle and then modify their local control decision dynamically according to the coordination message received from the coordinator. The prediction model proposed in [11] is used to predict the temperature over a control horizon for each agent. Each agent entity uses the temperature prediction data in its optimization model (Section 4) to compute the optimal control sequence. An agent is ignorant to other agent\u2019s control decisions. \u2022 Coordinator: the coordinator minimizes the carbon emission in order to assign a power budget for each agent while respecting a maximum power budget during each control horizon. The local agent operates on a receding horizon by solving for a fixed prediction horizon (2 h in our case) from the current time step t . The first control signal u z i ∗ ( t + 1 ) is applied to the building. All this process is executed as a closed-loop behavior. 4 Multi-agent control model We consider N zones operating with local agents each controlling a rooftop unit (RTU), and one coordinator. The zones have different sizes with different power requirements. We minimize the discomfort level in each zone within an interval of time N p . The power consumed in each zone should be bound to a power budget determined by the coordinator. The coordinator minimizes the carbon emissions and assign an optimal power budget for each zone with a condition that the sum does not exceed a maximum power budget during N p . 4.1 Local agent model Each agent solves a local optimal control problem to minimize discomfort during a prediction horizon N p . The discomfort is calculated according to the positive deviation ( $ / ° C ) between temperature setpoint in occupied and unoccupied times and the predicted temperature as formulated in (2). t + k | t indicates the predicted value of a certain variable at time step t + k starting from time step t . T ˆ i t + k | t is the predicted temperature for the whole prediction horizon (3). The T ̲ s p and T ¯ s p are the lower and upper temperature setpoint respectively, and they vary based on occupied and unoccupied times. The T s p is between 15°C and 26°C in unoccupied periodand between 21°C and 23°C in occupied period. The power consumption P i t + k | t u ˆ of each zone i is calculated by multiplying the control signals u ˆ i by the power of the cooling stage 1 ( P c , s 1 ), the cooling stage 2 ( P c , s 2 ), the heating stage 1 ( P h , s 1 ), heating stage 2 ( P h , s 2 ) and the supply fan ( P f ) as defined in (4). The constraint in (5) indicates that the power consumed by each agent at each time step t must not exceed a power budget pre-computed by the coordinator in Section 4.2. Table 2 summarizes the various symbols and related meanings. The state transition constraint is presented in (6), which reduces the wear-and-tear of HVAC equipment. All the possible state transitions from a control state u i t to a possible state u i t + 1 are defined in matrix A u i t , u i t + 1 . For instance, state 0 can only change to state 1 or remain at state 0, as follows. The optimization problem of each local agent, name P 1 i is defined as follows. (1) P 1 i = min u i ˆ Discomfort ( u i ˆ ) s . t . (2) Discomfort ( u i ˆ ) = ∑ k = 0 N p max 0 , T ˆ i t + k | t u i ˆ − T ¯ s p + max 0 , T ̲ s p − T ˆ i t + k | t u i ˆ ⋅ Δ t / 60 (3) T ˆ i t + k | t u i ˆ = f CAM-LSTM z i ( T i , t − l : t , u i , t − l : t , u ˆ i , t + 1 : t + k , v i , t − l : t , v ˆ i , t + 1 : t + k ) ∀ i , k (4) P i t + k | t u i ˆ = u ˆ c 1 i t + k | t ⋅ P c , s 1 + u ˆ c 2 i t + k | t ⋅ P c , s 2 + u ˆ f i t + k | t ⋅ P f + u ˆ h 1 i t + k | t ⋅ P h , s 1 + u ˆ h 2 i t + k | t ⋅ P h , s 2 ∀ i , k (5) P i t + k / t ( u i ˆ ) ≤ P budget i t + k / t ∀ k (6) A u i t , u i t + 1 = 1 (7) u i ˆ ∈ 0 , 5 4.2 Coordinator model In the coordinator model the MEF is considered and it indicates how the emission factor changes if an additional unit of energy is produced or consumed [28]. MEF is calculated using the linear regression approach described in [27] and originally demonstrated by Hawkes [29] and used to calculate marginal CO 2 rates for the United Kingdom. As described in (8), (9) and (10), the regression expresses the change in fossil generation Δ G t [ kWh/h ] and the change in emissions Δ Γ t [ g CO 2 / h ] , across a set of intervals ( t ∈ T ) [28]. The regression coefficient β represents the MEF, typically expressed in [ g CO 2 / kWh ] . (8) Δ Γ t = β . Δ G t (9) Δ Γ t = Γ t − Γ t − 1 (10) Δ G t = G t − G t − 1 In this paper the coordinator solves a global optimal control problem to minimize the carbon emission price ( c c a r b o n t ( u i ) ) which is computed by multiplying the MEF by a fixed carbon related cost π c a r b o n which presents the market price of the gram of CO 2 and by the power budget of each agent i at each time step t ∈ N p . Table 3 summarizes the various symbols and related meanings. The constraint in (12) indicates that the parallel operation of several agents at each time step must meet the power consumption limit P b u d g e t − m a x t of the HVAC system. For a scenario with 5 zones, we assume that: \u2022 During the unoccupied period, only the fan can be turned ON, so the control u i ˆ takes the state 0 or 1. We assume that only two zones will be set to state 0 and a maximum of three zones will be set to state 1 at the same time on each control horizon. In this case P budget − m a x will be equal to 2.1 kW. \u2022 During the occupied period, we assume that from 7 AM to 9 AM, heating stage 2 cannot be activated. The control u i ˆ takes state 4 as the maximum for all 5 zones. In this case P budget − m a x will be equal to 14.75 kW at each control horizon from 7 AM to 9 AM. The rest of the occupancy period, we assume that u i ˆ takes state 5 for up to 3 zones at the same time on each control horizon and state 4 for the other 2 zones. In this case, P budget − m a x will be equal to 21.5 kW at each control horizon from 9 AM to 6 PM. The constraint in (14) describes the state transition constraint.

The applied multi-agent control algorithm is further explained as follows: At first, the CAM-LSTM model [11] is trained for each zone, as shown in lines 1\u20134. Starting from line 5, the power budget is initialized as follows: if the experiment starts at the unoccupied time, we assume that the control of each zone is set to state 1, which means that only the fan is turned ON. In this case, the power budget of each zone is equal to 0.7 kW. On the other hand, if the experiment starts at occupancy time, we assume that the control of each zone goes to state 5, which means that the fan and heating stages 1 and 2 are ON. In this case, the power budget of each zone is equal to 5.2 kW. For each simulation step, data is acquired from simulation environment. The data includes past and future steps of uncontrolled variables (e.g. outdoor air temperature, day of the week and hour of the day), past controlled data, and past indoor temperature data for each zone i . As shown by line 8, the coordinator solve (P2) using ILP to compute P b u d g e t i t ( u i ˆ ) for all agents. Next, in lines 9\u201310, the algorithm 2 is executed in parallel for all local agents. Each agent computes its optimal control sequence u i ˆ t + k | t . A heuristic search algorithm based on genetic algorithm defined in [11], is used to find the possible optimal solutions of agent problem described in (1), as shown in the algorithm 2. Each agent optimal control sequence u i ˆ t + k | t is then passed to the simulator environment. 5 Validation and baselines To validate the proposed MAC approach, a Modelica-Python co-simulation testbed has been established, as shown in Fig. 3. The testbed is built on the foundation of two tools: the Modelica Buildings Library [12] used to create the RTU-based building model, and ModelicaGym [30] used to integrate the control algorithms described in Section 4.3, written in Python, with the time evolution of the Modelica model. A five-zone RTU building model is developed using base models inspired from [12] using the commercial Modelica software, Dymola. Details of the model and its control points are provided in Section 3.1. The model has been exported out of Dymola as a Functional Mockup Unit (FMU), a model that follows the Functional Mockup Interface (FMI) standard for exporting and exchanging models amongst a variety of simulation software. Once the FMU is outside of the modeling software, there is a communication layer between the control algorithm and simulation, implemented via ModelicaGym [30]. The ModelicaGym software is an open-source project designed to allow OpenAI Gym style simulation of FMUs in a Python environment. Specifically, this tool simulates the FMU by successively passing controls to the FMU, taking a single user-defined time step, and retrieving updated data from the FMU regarding the state of the simulation. This process is iterated for the duration of the simulation. ModelicaGym was adapted and utilized as a communication layer between the control algorithm and the FMU model. In Modelica, five zones are simulated and equipped with a RTU as discussed in Section 3.1. In the other hand, in Python, a real-time optimal multi-agent controller model is programmed, as shown in Fig. 3. The outputs of the controller u z i ∗ ( t + 1 ) are sent to Modelica which applies these controllers and returns the temperature feedback. Both the simulation time step and optimal control horizon are 5 min. Outdoor weather, hour of the day, day of the week and controllers parameters are exogenous inputs to the prediction models used in each agent. Fig. 4 shows the outdoor temperature for the conducted simulation day. In this study, the proposed multi-agent method which minimizes carbon-emissions for optimal control is compared with MAC approach which only minimizes power budget, centralized control method defined in a previous study [11] and the bang\u2013bang controller [31]. \u2022 Baseline control approach: The bang\u2013bang controller (ON-OFF controller) is a commonly used control approach for HVAC systems [31]. It is a feedback controller that switches ON or OFF when a desired setpoint has been reached. There is typically a small deadband to reduce excessive cycling. No optimization model is implemented in this baseline. The control operation follow a fixed schedule, and the occupancy time is from 7 AM to 6 PM. \u2022 Optimal centralized control approach: The controller collects all required information from all the zones. An online optimization model using GA is used to find the possible optimal solutions of the control optimization problem in centralized manner, as defined in [11]. The output of the centralized controller is considered as the \u201cnear-optimal\u201d, and is be used as benchmark to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach in this paper. \u2022 Optimal MAC approach: We implement MAC approach and in this case the coordinator minimizes only power budget without considering carbon emissions as follows: (16) P 2 a = min u ˆ ∑ k = 0 N p ∑ i = 1 N z P budget i t + k | t ( u i ˆ ) with the constraints (13)\u2013(15). The agents are optimized and controlled in a distributed manner. Each agent minimizes discomfort according the power budget computed by the coordinator as described in P 1 i . \u2022 Optimal MAC_CO2 approach: We implement MAC approach and in this case the coordinator minimizes the carbon emissions, as described in P2, and assign an optimal power budget for each agent with a condition that the sum does not exceed a maximum power budget. In the other hand, agents minimize discomfort according the power budgets computed by the coordinator. 6 Results and discussion 6.1 Results-I: MAC without considering carbon emission cost In the first experiment, we implement the MAC approach with P2a for the coordinator and P1 for the agent. Fig. 5 represents the three simulation results for bang\u2013bang, centralized approach and MAC approach. In the first row, the orange line identifies the temperature feedback of bang\u2013bang control. The green line represents the temperature results from centralized control approach. The blue line and the pink line represent the true temperature value and predicted temperature value of MAC approach respectively. We notice that the prediction is accurate compared to the real value. The temperature remains between the set points most of the time (21°C in occupied period and 15°C in unoccupied period). The temperature for the MAC approach remains consistent during occupied periods due to discomfort constraints. However, with a bang\u2013bang controller, there are no discomfort restrictions and temperature fluctuations may be greater. The three bottom graphs of Fig. 5 indicate the state of controls for each zone for MAC, centralized and bang\u2013bang control approaches respectively. All control states are described in detail in Table 1. The centralized control method, as indicated in [11], calculates the optimal control by considering all zones\u2019 control parameters. One of its objectives is to prevent simultaneous activation of all zones, particularly at the starting time, to avoid power peak. Due to this, the rise in temperature in zones 1, 4, and 5 was delayed, as observed in Fig. 5. In the morning of this winter time, as shown in Fig. 4, the outside temperature is very low, i.e., between −12°C and −10°C. The control in the bang\u2013bang method fluctuates between all controls OFF and heating stages 1 and 2. Therefore, the temperature in some zones fails to reach the setpoint because the control is not stable. On the other hand, the centralized method does not activate the heating stage 2 to minimize energy and respect power peak constraints. As a result, the temperature responses in the bang\u2013bang and centralized method are different in the morning. It is noticeable that multi-agent control keeps the heating stage 1 ( u h 1 ) ON and avoids turning ON the heating stage 2 ( u h 2 ), thus reducing energy consumption. Overall the control is stable and there are not many fluctuations. However, bang\u2013bang turns ON heating stage 2 more frequently, and the control values fluctuate a lot between the fan and the heating stage 2. MAC shifts the morning ramp on zone 1, 2 and 5 to be earlier and delays zone 3 and 4 in order to avoid a power peak caused by ramping all zones at once. 6.2 Results-II: MAC with considering carbon emission cost In the second experiment, we minimize the carbon emissions cost as described in P2. Fig. 6 presents the results of MAC without and with considering CO 2 . The temperature prediction is close to the ground truth values. However it is around 20°C in most of the time, which has a higher discomfort cost compared to the MAC approach as described in Table 4. The aim of MAC_CO2 is to minimize carbon emissions while also limiting energy consumption. To achieve this, the coordinator will allocate a lower power budget to each agent. This can prevent turning ON heating stage 2 ( u h 2 ) more frequently, however it may result in an increase in discomfort. Fig. 7 shows the difference in terms of the cumulative carbon emission between two experiments. The blue line represents MAC without considering the cost of CO 2 and the orange line represents MAC considering it. We notice that the emission of MAC_CO2 is less than for MAC. At the beginning of the day, both operate almost the same way, then MAC_CO2 consumes less during the rest of the day. In general, there is a reduction of 23.4%. Table 5 provides more details on these results. We have calculated the CO 2 electrical and gas consumption separately. We can see that there is a reduction of 0.02 tons of CO 2 equivalent for electrical consumption and 1.42 tons of CO 2 equivalent for gas consumption for one experiment day. 6.3 Algorithm performance 6.3.1 Algorithm convergence In the MAC approach, the local agents run in parallel to resolve the control optimization problem. Each zone is controlled by its own local agent, so the search space is relatively small for their GA algorithm. The centralized approach requires more time than MAC as described in Table 6. Moreover, in the centralized approach, we are limited with the number of zones. When the number of zones increases, the convergence time also increases. Whereas the MAC algorithm has a constant time complexity, denoted by O(1), regardless of the number of zones as shown in Table 6. We observe that the execution time of a cycle does not exceed the control horizon which is 5 min. Thus, the centralized approach supports no more than 10 zones, otherwise it will exceed the control horizon. However, in the MAC approach, since the agents run in parallel with a multiprocessor approach, the number of zones may be scalable according to the number of CPU cores contained in the computing machine. 6.3.2 Algorithm scalability The centralized algorithm has a linear time complexity. In other words, its execution time increases linearly with the size of zones. However, the proposed MAC approach is more scalable. If more zones are involved in the system, more local agents can be added without increasing the computation complexity. Therefore, one or more local agents can be easily updated or added/removed without significantly increasing the computation time since the agents are executing in parallel as described in Table 6. On the other hand, the centralized approach requires the entire formulation of the optimization problem to be updated when a zones changes. 6.3.3 MAC algorithm reconfigurability The enhanced reconfigurability of the MAC approach is an additional significant advantage for the optimal control of multi-zone HVAC system. It allows to manage flexibility by scaling up/down the control system and adding/removing terms in the optimization problem regarding user concerns in a specific agent. It also improves the robustness of the control decision under constantly changing indoor and outdoor conditions. When the outside climate changes or if a client wants to customize the control goals, the objective function of an optimization problem must be adapted. The MAC approach adopts different methods than the centralized approach. For the centralized optimal control approach, the optimization function is deployed in the central station. Reconfiguring this function must be done in the central station. Therefore, there is a risk of interrupting the overall control system. On the other hand, in the MAC approach, only a control agent needs to be reconfigured with no need to modify the entire control system when the dynamics of an agent component change. Moreover, any local failures do not interrupt the operation of the whole control system. For instance, if zones are offline in real buildings, the MAC approach may still be functional. This improves the resilience and robustness of the control system. 7 Conclusion In this paper, a multi-agent based on MPC model controller has been described, implemented and evaluated in a simulation environment using Python and Modelica. A multi-agent and coordinator optimization framework with low computation time is developed to minimize the discomfort, energy consumption and carbon emissions in the same time. A MAC approach based on genetic algorithm is proposed to solve the local agents optimization problems in parallel and its convergence, scalability and reconfigurability have been discussed. MAC is compared with centralized and bang\u2013bang control baselines. MAC performs better than bang\u2013bang in terms of energy consumption and discomfort. From the optimal controls, the centralized control approach performs the best in terms of energy consumption, but its computation time is the least suitable for real-time implementation. The efficiency of MAC is very close to the centralized approach, while taking less execution time. A scalability study shows that the centralized control approach supports up to 10 zones while the MAC approach is much more scalable. Our proposed approach improves the energy savings of 8.8% and a carbon footprint reduction of 23.4%. In future work, we will focus on: (1) deploying and validating the MAC approach in real building case study and, (2) extending our MAC system to optimize simultaneously building-level and grid-level objectives.

However, the high computational complexity in each control horizon, single point of failure risks, and the limited number of zones to control make the centralized approach unattractive. Unlike centralized controls, multi-agent control (MAC) systems are flexible and modular. This paper proposes a scalable multi-agent based distributed approach for optimized control of a multi-zone smart building based on a set of local agents which represent individual zones in the building, coordinated by a central agent. For each control horizon, the coordinator minimizes the overall carbon emissions and assigns an individual energy budget to each local agent. Each local agent minimizes the discomfort in its zone while respecting the energy budget assigned by the coordinator. We propose a heuristic search based on a genetic algorithm to find the optimized control sequences in each zone, and formulate an integer linear programming (ILP) model for the coordinator problem which can be solved using an ILP solver. For a representative winter test day, the proposed methodology gave an energy savings of 8.8% and reduced the carbon footprint by 23.4%.",
