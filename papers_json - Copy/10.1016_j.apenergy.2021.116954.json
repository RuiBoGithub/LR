Demand-controlled ventilation (DCV) is widely used for the energy-efficient provision of indoor air quality. However, existing DCV requires a continuously variable airflow rate, and is not applicable to the constant-air-volume mechanical ventilation (generally in buildings with room air conditioners and free-running buildings). This study proposes a novel DCV for constant-air-volume mechanical ventilation. To achieve high ventilation efficiency, the proposed DCV operates the constant-air-volume mechanical ventilation continuously and intermittently at full-load/quasi-full-load and partial-load conditions respectively, which is controlled by the upper and lower concentration limits of indoor airborne pollutants (indicated by indoor CO2 concentration). The larger upper and lower concentration limits are preferred for energy saving, but could deteriorate indoor air quality, and cause durability problems due to frequent on-off operations. A genetic algorithm-based optimization is developed to determine the upper and lower concentration limits to maximize energy efficiency while satisfying the demand on indoor air quality and avoiding excessively frequent on-off operations. Case studies verify that the ventilation performance of the proposed DCV optimization is more sensitive to the lower concentration limit than the upper concentration limit. The conventional methods (the continuous ventilation and the intermittent ventilation) for the constant-air-volume mechanical ventilation risk low energy efficiency and deteriorated durability. The proposed DCV optimization improves energy efficiency by up to 88% while meeting demanded indoor air quality and durability.

Occupants spend about 90% of their time on indoor activities [2]. However, indoor air quality is generally poorer than outdoor air quality. The sources of indoor airborne pollutants include the endogenous (e.g., emissions from building materials and human activities), indoor reaction products, and outdoor airborne pollutants. The concentration of indoor airborne pollutants could be 2\u20135 times higher than that of outdoor airborne pollutants [3]. Poor indoor air quality results in excessive morbidity and mortality, including sick building syndromes (e.g., pruritus, dry cough, ocular pruritus, and headache) [4] and diseases like extrinsic allergic alveolitis, and asthma [5]. The damage to occupants\u2019 health caused by poor indoor air quality is estimated to be more severe than those caused by road traffic accidents [6]. Building ventilation is effective in controlling indoor air quality, but consumes a large portion of building energy [7]. Building ventilation dilutes and removes indoor airborne pollutants with outdoor air. There are strong associations between insufficient building ventilation and the transmission of infectious diseases, such as COVID-19 [8], influenza [9], measles, tuberculosis, chickenpox, smallpox, and SARS [10]. Sufficient building ventilation can improve health outcomes by 20% to several folds [11]. However, building ventilation enlarges building energy consumption by increasing the cooling or heating load, and energy consumption of ventilation fans [12]. Reducing building energy consumption is an effective strategy against climate change and energy crisis [13]. While buildings are responsible for around 40% of the total energy consumption, building ventilation accounts for around 50% or more of the building energy consumption [14]. Thus, proper building ventilation should aim at indoor air quality and energy efficiency simultaneously. Demand-controlled ventilation (DCV) can meet the demand for indoor air quality and reduce energy consumption [15]. DCV is a kind of smart ventilation, which increases the ventilation airflow rate when there are advantages in indoor air quality and/or energy efficiency, and reduces it when there are disadvantages [16]. DCV varies the ventilation airflow rate automatically and continuously according to the concentration of a chosen pollutant indoors [17]. The chosen indoor pollutant is the most concerned one (e.g., CO2 or humidity), and the concentration control of the chosen pollutant is adequate for the control of the other pollutants indoors for indoor air quality [18]. Afroz et al. [19] evaluated the effects of DCV on the perception of indoor air quality in real buildings, and verified that DCV contributed to a healthy indoor environment. Regarding energy efficiency, generally, DCV saves energy from the variation of occupant numbers by reducing unnecessary airflow rate when a room is partially occupied [20]. With fixed occupant numbers, Cheng et al. [21] proposed a novel DCV to further harvest energy saving via the optimization of the indoor airflow field. The energy saving by DCV varies largely with the ventilation systems, outdoor weather, building characteristics, occupancy, indoor thermal conditions, etc., and is reportedly up to 90% [22]. However, DCV requires the ventilation airflow rate to be variable continuously [23] while the mechanical ventilation in buildings with room air conditioners and free-running buildings is generally of constant-air-volume [16]. Room air conditioners (e.g., window-mount air conditioners or ductless split-type air conditioners) are popularly employed in small-to-medium-sized rooms for thermal comfort [24]. However, because of their limited capability in providing fresh outdoor air, these room air conditioners are reported to deteriorate indoor air quality, with an increase in indoor CO2 concentration by 86% in Hong Kong [24], and by two folds in Singapore [25]. Thus, auxiliary mechanical ventilation is required for indoor air quality in buildings with room air conditioners [26]. In free-running buildings, auxiliary mechanical ventilation is also required because natural ventilation cannot always provide sufficient ventilation [27]. The mechanical ventilation in buildings with room air conditioners or in free-running buildings is generally a constant-air-volume type (e.g., exhaust ventilation), of which the ventilation airflow rate is fixed at one or several specific values [28]. Thus, the existing DCV concept of a continuously variable airflow rate is inapplicable to the constant-air-volume mechanical ventilation (CAVMV). Inspired by the concept of intermittent ventilation (also termed as short-term ventilation), this study proposes a novel DCV for the CAVMV. Intermittent ventilation (e.g., intermittent air jet [29], and stratum ventilation with intermittent air supply [30]) can generate dynamic thermal conditions for improved thermal comfort. Meanwhile, the intermittent ventilation can also reduce energy consumption by reducing the ventilated air volume. The intermittent ventilation was reported to have an energy saving potential of 53% in an auditorium space [32], of 41% in a sleeping environment [31], and of around 90% in a work environment [28]. Considering that the intermittent ventilation can change the ventilated air volume, it is employed in this study to control the ventilation airflow rate of the CAVMV equivalently. That is that the intermittently operated mechanical ventilation with a relatively large ventilation airflow rate is equivalent to the continuously operated mechanical ventilation with a relatively small ventilation airflow rate. The proposed DCV operates intermittently at the partial-load condition, and continuously at the full-load/quasi-full-load condition for indoor air quality, durability of the CAVMV, and energy saving. The main contributions of this study are as follows: (1) The mechanisms of energy saving by the proposed DCV are revealed by qualitative analysis (Section 2.1). (2) Energy saving is maximized while satisfying the demands on indoor air quality, and durability of the CAVMV by the proposed DCV with a genetic algorithm-based optimization (Section 2.2). (3) The ventilation performance improvement by the proposed DCV optimization compared with two conventional methods is verified with case studies (Section 3). 2 Methodology 2.1 Mechanisms of energy saving by demand-controlled ventilation proposed The operation of the CAVMV with the proposed DCV is controlled by the upper and lower limits of the indoor pollutant concentration. When the indoor pollutant concentration approaches the upper limit, the CAVMV is switched on for indoor air quality, and then the indoor pollutant concentration decays (Fig. 1 (a)). The indoor pollutant concentration decays faster at first because of the larger difference between the indoor and outdoor pollutant concentrations. With the decaying indoor pollutant concentration, the difference between the indoor and outdoor pollutant concentrations decreases, and the indoor pollutant concentration tends to be steady. The steady concentration is linearly related to the reciprocal of the ventilation airflow rate [33]. Thus, when the ventilation airflow rate is relatively small, the steady concentration could be larger than the lower limit of the indoor pollutant concentration, and the CAVMV has to operate continuously. Otherwise, when the indoor pollutant concentration reaches the lower limit, the CAVMV is switched off for energy saving, and then the indoor pollutant concentration starts to build up (Fig. 1(b)). (1) C i n , s t e a d y = 3600 G ε V Q + C o Where C in,steady is the steady concentration of indoor airborne pollutants (ppm); C o is the pollutant concentration in outdoor air (ppm); G is the pollutant generation rate indoors (ml/s); Q is the sum of the ventilation airflow rate of mechanical ventilation and the infiltration (air change per hour - ACH); V is the volume of the room (m3); ε is the pollutant removal efficiency, which is one for well-mixed indoor air [34]. To achieve high energy efficiency, firstly, the pollutant removal efficiency of the CAVMV should be high, i.e., the pollutant concentration in the exhausted air should be high. Thus, when the steady concentration (Eq. (1)) is high, the CAVMV should operate continuously with the pollutant concentration in the exhausted air at a high steady concentration. Generally, the ventilation airflow rate of the CAVMV is designed for a high steady concentration at the design condition (i.e., the full-load condition). Thus, the CAVMV is designed to operate continuously with high energy efficiency. However, it is common for the CAVMV to experience the partial-load condition with the indoor pollutant generation less than that of the design condition. With the decreased indoor pollutant generation, the steady concentration at the partial-load condition decreases (Eq. (1)). The decreased steady concentration deteriorates the energy efficiency of the continuously operated CAVMV at the partial-load condition. The proposed DCV sets a lower limit of the indoor pollutant concentration larger than the steady concentration at the partial-load condition, so that the CAVMV would operate intermittently. When the indoor pollutant concentration is above the lower limit, the pollutant concentration in the exhausted air by the CAVMV is high with high energy efficiency. When the indoor pollutant concentration reaches the lower limit, the CAVMV is switched off to save energy. Fig. 1(a) also shows that a higher lower limit is preferred for high energy efficiency. With a higher lower limit, the indoor pollutant concentration decays faster, which indicates that the indoor pollutant removal efficiency is higher. Secondly, a longer switch-off period of the CAVMV contributes to energy saving. Fig. 1(b) shows that the build-up speed decreases with the increasing indoor pollutant concentration. At a low indoor pollutant concentration, the pollutant removal efficiency by the ingress outdoor air (e.g., by infiltration) is low. This is because the difference between the indoor pollutant concentration and outdoor pollutant concentration is small, and the indoor pollutant generation dominates the build-up period with a fast build-up speed. At a high indoor pollutant concentration, the pollutant removal efficiency of the ingress outdoor air increases and effectively off-sets the indoor pollutant generation. This results in a decreasing build-up speed. A slower build-up speed indicates a longer switch-off period of the CAVMV. Thus, a larger upper limit of the indoor pollutant concentration is preferred for high energy efficiency. Thirdly, when the CAVMV operates intermittently, the decay period should be effectively used for high energy efficiency. Fig. 1(c) shows that the intermittent operation consists of the stages of starting up, normal ventilation cycle, and ending. Regarding the normal ventilation cycle, a decay period is followed by a build-up period. However, regarding the ending stage, the CAVMV can be switched off during the decay period (e.g., with the ending time of t e1 in Fig. 1(c)) or the build-up period (e.g., with the ending time of t e2 in Fig. 1(c)) as long as the working time of the entire ventilation operation runs up (e.g., eight hours). When the entire ventilation operation ends during the decay period, the indoor pollutant concentration could be unnecessarily low because the room will not be occupied afterward. This indicates that the decay period has not been effectively used. When the entire ventilation operation ends during the build-up period, the indoor pollutant concentration could be high, indicating that the decay period has been effectively used. It is the most desired that the entire ventilation operation ends during the build-up period with the indoor pollutant concentration around its upper limit, which is co-determined by the upper and lower limits of the indoor pollutant concentration (Eq. (2)). (2) TL e n t i r e = TL s + n ( ATI 1 + ATI 2 ) Where TLe ntire is the time length of the entire ventilation operation (s); TLs is the time length of the starting up stage (s); ATI is the action time interval of an on-off operation (s); ATI 1 indicates the time length of the decay period (s), and ATI 2 indicates the time length of the build-up period (s); n is an integer. It should be pointed out that the upper limit of the indoor pollutant concentration should meet the indoor air quality requirement. CO2 is widely used as an indicator of indoor air quality [35]. Different indoor air quality standards have stipulated demands on indoor air quality regarding the indoor CO2 concentration, e.g., SS 553 and 554 (Singapore), ISHRAE 10,001 (India), EN15251 (Europe), and ISO 17,772 (international) [33]. For example, ISO 17,772 stipulates that the indoor CO2 concentration is allowed to be 550 ppm above the outdoor CO2 concentration for indoor air quality of Category I (for fragile and sensitive occupants), and 800 ppm above the outdoor CO2 concentration for indoor air quality of Category II (representing the normal level of expectancy) [36]. Moreover, the upper and lower limits of the indoor pollutant concentration should meet the demand for the durability of the CAVMV. Durability is indicated by the on\u2013off operations. A closer distance between the upper and lower limits of the indoor pollutant concentration requires more frequent on\u2013off operations, which could cause more severe damages to the durability of the CAVMV. The on\u2013off operation frequency can be quantified by the action time interval of an on\u2013off operation. As shown in Fig. 1(c), the action time interval of an on\u2013off operation can have different values for the decay period (i.e., ATI 1), the build-up period (i.e., ATI 2), and the ending stage (i.e., ATI 3). The minimum denotes the on\u2013off operation frequency, which should be constrained to be larger than a specific value for the durability of the CAVMV, e.g., 10 min [37] or 20 min [38]. 2.2 Demand-controlled optimization proposed Section 2.1 shows that the upper and lower limits of the indoor pollutant concentration significantly affect the ventilation performance of the proposed DCV, thus should be optimally determined for the maximal energy saving while meeting demands on indoor air quality and durability of the CAVMV. A genetic algorithm-based optimization for the proposed DCV is developed (Fig. 2 ), The required inputs by the optimization are the room volume, infiltration, ventilation airflow rate of the CAVMV, initial indoor pollutant concentration, pollutant concentration in outdoor air, and occupancy. This study uses CO2 as the indicator of indoor air quality because it is convenient to be measured and can efficiently represent the indoor air quality as suggested by different standards [33]. The indoor pollutant sources of CO2 are occupants [39]. The CO2 generation rate by an occupant is estimated by Eq. (3), which is determined by the metabolic rate, and individual features (height, mass, and gender) [40]. (3) Q C O 2 = e ∙ 0.202 R Q ∙ M ∙ H 0.725 ∙ W 0.425 21 0.23 R Q + 0.77 Q C O 2 is the CO2 generation rate by an occupant (ml/s); RQ is the molar ratio of the exhaled CO2 to the inhaled O2, which is 0.83 for an averaged adult with light or sedentary activities; M is the metabolic rate (W/m2); H is the height (m); W is the mass (kg); e is a correction factor, which is 0.75 and 0.85 for Chinese females and males respectively [41]. With the inputs, the optimizer uses the optimization algorithm, e.g., the genetic algorithm [42], the variable-metric algorithm [43], and the differential evolution algorithm [44], to determine the trials of the upper and lower limits of the indoor pollutant concentration from a given search range. This study employs a genetic algorithm. The genetic algorithm is a search heuristic that mimics Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection (i.e., mutation, crossover, and selection) [45]. Because of the powerful search capability, the genetic algorithm is widely used to search optimal solutions [46]. The search range constrains the upper limit of the indoor pollutant concentration (C U in Fig. 2) to be lower than that stipulated by standards for indoor air quality (θ IAQ in Fig. 2) (Section 2.1), and higher than the outdoor pollutant concentration (C o in Fig. 2). The search range constrains the lower limit of the indoor pollutant concentration (C L in Fig. 2) to be lower than the upper limit (Section 2.1), and larger than the outdoor pollutant concentration. With the determined trials of the upper and lower limits of the indoor pollutant concentration from the genetic algorithm and the inputs, the ventilation performance of the proposed DCV is evaluated based on the concentration profile of the indoor airborne pollutants. The concentration profile of the indoor airborne pollutants with the proposed DCV is calculated according to Eq. (4) [39]. Eq. (4) is derived for the well-mixed indoor air, which has been experimentally validated to be reasonably accurate by Shriram and Ramamurthy [28]. The ventilation performance regarding energy efficiency is indicated by the total air change by the CAVMV, which is determined by the ventilation airflow rate of the CAVMV and the total ventilation time (Eq. (5)). The total ventilation time is the sum of the decay periods of all the normal ventilation cycles and the ventilation time of the ending stage (Fig. 1(c)). A smaller total air change indicates a smaller energy consumption of the ventilation fan [47], and a smaller cooling load/heating load for thermal comfort [48]. The performance evaluation also calculates the on\u2013off operation frequency in terms of the action time interval (Eq. (6)) (Section 2.2 and Fig. 1(c)). (4) C i n , i + Δ t = Δ t G i V - Δ t Q C i n , i - C o , i 3600 + C i n , i (5) TAC = VQt 3600 (6) ATI = min { ATI 1 , ATI 2 , ATI 3 } Where ATI is the action time interval (s), and ATI 1, ATI 2, and ATI 3 are referred to Fig. 1(c); C in and C o are the pollutant concentrations in indoor and outdoor air respectively (ppm); G is the pollutant generation rate indoors (ml/s); Q is the sum of the ventilation airflow rate of mechanical ventilation and the infiltration (ACH); TAC is the total air change (m3); t is the accumulated time when the CAVMV is on (s); V is the room air volume (m3); Δ t is the calculation time interval (e.g., 1 s); Subscript i denotes the ith calculation time interval. Minimizing the total air change for maximal energy saving is the objective of the optimization. The optimization is constrained that the action time interval should be larger than a specific value (e.g., 10 min) to avoid excessively frequent on\u2013off operations. Thus, the fitness function of the optimization is formulated as Eq. (7). The k in the fitness function is a large penalty of an action time interval beyond the constraint to exclude the upper and lower limits, which risk excessively frequent on\u2013off operations (Eq. (8)). The optimizer iteratively updates the trails until the fitness function converges. Finally, the outputted optimal upper and lower limits of the indoor pollutant concentration maximizes energy efficiency and meets the demands on indoor air quality and durability of the CAVMV simultaneously. (7) Fitness = T A C ( 1 + k ) (8) k = 0 , A T I ≥ θ durability p , A T I < θ durability Where TAC is the total air change (m3); k is an adjustable factor determined by the action time interval (ATI); p is a penalty (e.g., 10) when the action time interval fails to meet the demand on durability of the CAVMV (θ durability). 3 Result Case studies in a classroom are conducted to demonstrate the application and effectiveness of the proposed DCV optimization. The classroom is in an environmental chamber at the City University of Hong Kong, with dimensions of 8.8 m (length) × 6.1 m (width) × 2.4 m [49]. The environmental chamber can achieve well mixing by mixing ventilation with conditioned air [50]. Thus Eq. (4) is applicable for this classroom [31]. The outdoor air is supplied independently from the air conditioner by the CAVMV [39]. The CAVMV is designed for 25 occupants [51]. The metabolic rate for the calculation of the indoor CO2 generation by a sedentary occupant is 60 W/m2 (Eq. (3)) [52]. The gender correction factor, height, and mass are 0.8, 1.65 m, and 57.5 kg, respectively (for the average of Chinese females and males) (Eq. (3)) [41]. The outdoor CO2 concentration is 400 ppm [21]. The demand for indoor air quality is that the maximal indoor CO2 concentration is 800 ppm above the outdoor CO2 concentration for indoor air quality of Category II [36]. Thus, the designed ventilation airflow rate of the CAVMV is 3 ACH [33]. The infiltration is 0.2 ACH [53]. The initial CO2 concentration is assumed to be the same as the outdoor CO2 concentration, and the time length of the entire ventilation operation is eight hours [54]. Given the outdoor CO2 concentration and the demand for indoor air quality, the search range of the upper limit of the indoor CO2 concentration is between 400 ppm and 1200 ppm, and that of the lower limit is above 400 ppm and less than the upper limit (Fig. 2). The action time interval is constrained to be not less than 10 min for the durability of the CAVMV [38]. 3.1 Evaluation of ventilation performance This section demonstrates an example of the ventilation performance evaluation when the room is occupied by ten occupants. Fig. 3 shows that when the trials of upper and low limits of the indoor CO2 concentration are 1200 ppm [36] and 700 ppm [28] respectively, the entire ventilation operation consists of a starting up stage, four normal ventilation cycles and an ending stage. During the starting up stage, the indoor CO2 concentration builds up from 400 ppm to 1200 ppm, and the air change by the CAVMV is nil because the CAVMV is off. During the decay period of a normal ventilation cycle, the indoor CO2 concentration decreases from 1200 ppm to 700 ppm and the total air change linearly increases because the CAVMV is on. During the build-up period of a normal ventilation cycle with the CAVMV switched off, the indoor CO2 concentration increases from 700 ppm to 1200 ppm, and the total air change remains invariable. During the ending stage, the CAVMV is switched off at the decay period with the indoor CO2 concentration of around 830 ppm because the entire ventilation operation is over. During the entire ventilation operation, Category II of indoor air quality is achieved with the indoor CO2 concentration less than 1200 ppm [36], and the total air change of the entire ventilation operation is 1728 m3 (Eq. (5)). Regarding the on\u2013off operation frequency, the time length of the decay period (3674 s) is longer than that of the build-up period (2292 s), and that of the ending stage is the shortest (1396 s) (Fig. 4 ). Thus, the action time interval is 1396 s (Eq. (6)), which satisfies the constraint for the durability of the CAVMV (10 min). 3.2 Effects of upper limit of indoor CO2 concentration The effects of the upper limit of the indoor CO2 concentration on the ventilation performance are demonstrated with the lower limit of the indoor CO2 concentration fixed at 700 ppm [28] and the room occupied by ten occupants (Fig. 5 ). Generally, with the increasing upper limit of the indoor CO2 concentration, the total air change decreases with improved energy efficiency. This is mainly because a larger upper limit of the indoor CO2 concentration results in a longer switch-off period of the CAVMV (Section 2.1). The increasing upper limit of the indoor CO2 concentration also increases the action time interval by enlarging the difference between the upper and lower limits of the indoor CO2 concentration (Section 2.1). However, sharp decreases in the action time interval and local increases in the total air change are observed when the upper limit of the indoor CO2 concentration increases. This indicates that a larger upper limit of the indoor CO2 concentration does not always benefit the ventilation performance. The sharp decrease in the action time interval and the local increase in the total air change are mainly determined by the ending stage, which can be explained by Cases 1\u20133 with the upper limits of the indoor CO2 concentration of 1085 ppm, 1090 ppm, and 1135 ppm respectively. Fig. 6 shows the entire ventilation operation of Case 1 is ended at the early beginning of the decay period, which results in a sharp decrease in the action time interval. The entire ventilation operation of Case 2 ends when the indoor CO2 concentration builds up to the upper limit, and that of Case 3 ends when the indoor CO2 decays to the lower limit (Fig. 6). This indicates that Case 2 effectively utilizes the decay period of the ending stage for high energy efficiency while Case 3 does not (Section 2.1). As a result, a local increase in the total air change occurs when the upper limit of the indoor CO2 concentration increases from Case 2 to Case 3. Thus, when intermittently operated, the upper limit of the indoor CO2 concentration should be properly determined at a high level while ensuring that the entire ventilation operation is ended at the build-up period with the indoor CO2 concentration close to the upper limit, so that the sudden decrease in the action time interval and the local increase in the total air change can be avoided for high energy efficiency and durability of the CAVMV. 3.3 Effects of lower limit of indoor pollutant concentration The effects of the lower limit of the indoor CO2 concentration on the ventilation performance are demonstrated at the upper limit of the indoor CO2 concentration of 1200 ppm and the room occupied by ten occupants (Fig. 7 ). When the lower limit of the indoor CO2 concentration increases from 400 ppm to 680 ppm, the total air change and the action time interval keep invariable. This is because the lower limit of the indoor CO2 concentration is lower than the steady concentration (Eq. (1)), and the CAVMV operates continuously after the starting up stage (see Case 4 with the lower limit of the indoor CO2 concentration of 680 ppm in Fig. 8 ). When the lower limit of the indoor CO2 concentration is larger than the steady concentration, the CAVMV operates intermittently, and the total air change generally decreases with the increasing lower limit of the indoor CO2 concentration. This is mainly because the increasing lower limit of the indoor CO2 concentration increases the indoor CO2 removal efficiency of the CAVMV by increasing the CO2 concentration in the exhausted air (Section 2.1). However, the increasing lower limit of the indoor CO2 concentration decreases the action time interval by reducing the difference between the upper and lower limits of the indoor CO2 concentration. Thus, although a larger lower limit of the indoor CO2 concentration is preferred by energy saving, it should be limited for the durability of the CAVMV. Moreover, sharp decreases in the action time interval and local increases in the total air change exist when the lower limit of the indoor CO2 concentration increases (Fig. 7), which can be explained by Cases 5\u20137 with the lower limits of the indoor CO2 concentration of 790 ppm, 795 ppm, and 810 ppm respectively. Fig. 8 shows the entire ventilation operation of Case 6 is ended at the early beginning of the decay period, thus a sharp decrease in the action time interval occurs. The entire ventilation operation of Case 5 ends when the indoor CO2 builds up approaching the upper limit, and that of Case 7 ends when the indoor CO2 concentration decays to the lower limit (Fig. 8). In other words, Case 5 effectively utilizes the decay period of the ending stage for energy saving while Case 7 does not (Section 2.1). As a result, a local increase in the total air change occurs when the lower limit of the indoor CO2 concentration increases from Case 5 to Case 7. Thus, when intermittently operated, the lower limit of the indoor CO2 concentration should be properly determined at a high level while ensuring that the entire ventilation operation is ended at the build-up period with the indoor CO2 concentration close to the upper limit for high energy efficiency and durability of the CAVMV. 3.4 Ventilation performance of demand-controlled optimization proposed The load ratio is defined as the ratio of the numbers of occupants in the room to the designed numbers of occupants of the room (i.e., 25). For example, when the room is occupied by ten occupants, the load ratio is 40%. At this load ratio, the genetic algorithm searches the optimal upper and lower limits of the indoor CO2 concentration for the minimal fitness (Eq. (7)) iteratively (i.e., generation by generation) (Fig. 9 ). The fitness value converges to around 1019 m3. The outputted optimal upper and lower limits of the indoor CO2 concentration are 1199 ppm and 976 ppm respectively. With these optimal limits, Fig. 10 shows that the CAVMV operates intermittently, and the entire ventilation operation ends at the build-up period with the indoor CO2 concentration close to the upper limit. The action time interval is 632 s. Thus, the upper and lower limits of the indoor CO2 concentration determined by the DCV optimization are consistent with the guidelines for the intermittent operation identified in Sections 3.2 and 3.3 for indoor air quality, energy saving and durability of the CAVMV that the upper and lower limits should be reasonably large while ensuring that the entire ventilation operation ends at the build-up period with the indoor CO2 concentration close to the upper limit. Fig. 11 shows that the upper and lower limits of the indoor CO2 concentration determined by the DCV optimization with the load ratio increasing from 20% to 100%. It can be seen that the upper limits of the indoor CO2 concentration are relatively stable (around 1200 ppm), and the lower limits of the indoor CO2 concentration vary significantly from 400 ppm to around 980 ppm. In other words, the proposed DCV optimization is more sensitive to the lower limit than the upper limit of the indoor CO2 concentration. This might be because that the lower limit of the indoor CO2 concentration exerts a more important effect on the indoor CO2 concentration than the upper limit of the indoor CO2 concentration (Eq. (4) [28]), and thus it is more effective to adjust the lower limit of the indoor CO2 concentration for indoor air quality, energy saving and durability of the CAVMV. With these optimal upper and lower limits of the indoor CO2 concentration, for the partial-load condition with a relatively small load ratio (20 \u2013 60%), the CAVMV operates intermittently and ends at the build-up period with the indoor CO2 concentration close to the upper limits (Fig. 10). These results further verify the operation guidelines for the intermittent operation. For the full-load/quasi-full-load condition with a relatively large load ratio (80% −100%), the CAVMV operates continuously after reaching the upper limit of the indoor CO2 concentration (Fig. 10). The effectiveness of the DCV optimization is demonstrated by compared with two conventional methods. With Conventional Method 1 (i.e., the continuous ventilation) (Table 1 ), the CAVMV operates continuously for the entire ventilation operation, thus the action time interval is the same as the time length of the entire ventilation operation (i.e., eight hours). With Conventional Method 2 (i.e., the intermittent ventilation) (Table 1), the CAVMV operates intermittently, controlled by the upper and lower limits of the indoor CO2 concentration of 1200 ppm [36] and 900 ppm respectively [28]. Thus, all the methods satisfy the demanded indoor air quality with the indoor CO2 concentration less than 1200 ppm. The total air change with Conventional Method 1 stays at 3092 m3, while that with the DCV optimization increases from 379 m3 to 2949 m3 with the increasing load ratio (Fig. 12 ). Thus, the energy saving achieved by the DCV optimization compared with Conventional Method 1 increases with the decreasing load ratio, and is up to 88%. Compared with Conventional Method 2, the DCV optimization can save energy by up to 11% (Fig. 12). Moreover, while the DCV optimization satisfies the demand on the durability with the action time interval varying between 632 s and 1683 s, Conventional Method 2 risks deteriorating the durability with the action time interval less than the constraint of 10 min (i.e., 421 s and 59 s for the load ratios of 20% and 60% respectively) (Fig. 12). Thus, the DCV optimization outperforms Conventional Method 1 regarding energy saving, and outperforms Conventional Method 2 in terms of both energy saving and durability of the CAVMV (Table 1). It should be noted that the effects of ventilation airflow rate can be reflected by the load ratio (the ratio of the real number of occupants to the designed number of occupants). A smaller load ratio indicates a larger ventilation airflow rate for an occupant. Thus, with the decreasing load ratio, the CO2 concentration decays faster during the decay period (Fig. 10). Fig. 12 shows, the proposed method outperforms the conventional methods for energy saving and durability, particularly at the smaller load ratio, which indicates the proposed method outperforms the conventional methods, particularly at a larger ventilation airflow rate. 4 Discussion It should be noted that this study concerns indoor air quality. The total air change refers to the outdoor air, and minimizing the total air change minimizes the energy consumption for indoor air quality. When thermal comfort and indoor air quality are concerned simultaneously (e.g., with a central air conditioning system), with the enthalpy of outdoor air is higher/lower than that of indoor air in the cooling condition/heating condition, the airflow rate of outdoor air should be determined by Fig. 2 [47]. With the enthalpy of outdoor air is lower/higher than that of indoor air in the cooling condition/heating condition, the airflow rate of outdoor air should satisfy both indoor air quality and thermal comfort (i.e., selecting the larger one between that determined by Fig. 2 and that determined by the requirement of thermal comfort [47]). In practice, the CO2 generation rate is mainly determined by the number of occupants, and the CO2 concentration in the outdoor air is relatively steady [21]. When the number of occupants changes with the variable load ratio (which can be predicted or inferred by existing methods [20]), the upper limit and lower limit of indoor CO2 concentration need to be re-optimized by the proposed method (Fig. 11). Moreover, the proposed method determines the outdoor air supply for a single zone. When multiple zones are concerned, the proposed method can be used to calculate the outdoor air supply for every single zone. Based on the outdoor air supply for every single zone, the final outdoor air supply can be determined according to the critical zone which can refer to Shan et al. [55]. 5 Conclusions This study proposes a novel demand-controlled optimization of the constant-air-volume mechanical ventilation for indoor air quality, durability, and energy saving. The proposed demand-controlled ventilation responds to the demands via on\u2013off operations that the constant-air-volume mechanical ventilation operates continuously at the full-load/quasi-full-load condition and intermittently at the partial-load condition. The on\u2013off operations are controlled by the upper and lower limits of indoor airborne pollutants (reflected by indoor CO2 concentration). The mechanisms of energy saving by the proposed demand-controlled ventilation are qualitatively analyzed, and a genetic algorithm-based optimization on the demand-controlled ventilation is developed to maximize energy saving while satisfying the demands on indoor air quality and durability of the constant-air-volume mechanical ventilation. Case studies are conducted to verify the demand-controlled optimization by compared with two conventional methods (i.e., the continuous ventilation and the intermittent ventilation). The main findings are as follows: (1) A large upper limit and a large lower limit of the indoor airborne pollutants are preferred for high energy efficiency, but should be constrained for indoor air quality and durability. (2) When operated intermittently at the partial load condition, the upper and lower limits should ensure that the entire ventilation operation ends at the build-up period with the concentration of the indoor airborne pollutants close to the upper limit. (3) The demand-controlled optimization is more sensitive to the lower limit than the upper limit of the indoor airborne pollutants. (4) Compared with the conventional methods, the demand-controlled optimization saves energy by up to 88% while satisfying demands on indoor air quality and durability. The conventional method of continuous ventilation risks low energy efficiency, while the conventional method of intermittent ventilation risks low energy efficiency and deteriorates durability.

However, existing DCV requires a continuously variable airflow rate, and is not applicable to the constant-air-volume mechanical ventilation (generally in buildings with room air conditioners and free-running buildings). This study proposes a novel DCV for constant-air-volume mechanical ventilation. To achieve high ventilation efficiency, the proposed DCV operates the constant-air-volume mechanical ventilation continuously and intermittently at full-load/quasi-full-load and partial-load conditions respectively, which is controlled by the upper and lower concentration limits of indoor airborne pollutants (indicated by indoor CO2 concentration). The larger upper and lower concentration limits are preferred for energy saving, but could deteriorate indoor air quality, and cause durability problems due to frequent on-off operations. A genetic algorithm-based optimization is developed to determine the upper and lower concentration limits to maximize energy efficiency while satisfying the demand on indoor air quality and avoiding excessively frequent on-off operations. Case studies verify that the ventilation performance of the proposed DCV optimization is more sensitive to the lower concentration limit than the upper concentration limit. The conventional methods (the continuous ventilation and the intermittent ventilation) for the constant-air-volume mechanical ventilation risk low energy efficiency and deteriorated durability. The proposed DCV optimization improves energy efficiency by up to 88% while meeting demanded indoor air quality and durability.",
