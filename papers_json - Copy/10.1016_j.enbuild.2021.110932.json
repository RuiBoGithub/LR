Multi-energy flexibility measures comprising energy substitution and demand-side management (DSM) can enhance the control of buildings and help them participate in the energy market, obtaining greater profit margins. However, the application of these flexibility measures is also subject to many limitations. For example, DSM is a kind of load redistribution process in which the energy payback constraints associated with comfort or usage demand should be considered. Therefore, this work studies the optimal energy management of a building energy system (BES) considering multi-energy flexibility measures, specifically under the energy payback effect, to better guide the peak shaving strategies. First, energy substitution measures are proposed involving energy conversion and storage modeling. Second, a novel dynamic two-step DSM measure is modeled for the reduction and recovery process. Then, a mixed-integer and linear programming (MILP)-based energy management model is developed to optimize the operation of smart buildings for peak shaving. The case studies demonstrate that 1) a BES can obtain better profit by utilizing multi-energy flexibility measures; 2) optimized multi-load recovery strategies can enhance the flexibility potential of a BES; and 3) a reasonable multi-load recovery mechanism should be established to offset the energy payback effect. Keywords Demand-side management Energy payback Energy substitution Real-time incentive 1 Introduction Buildings are emerging as the critical energy-consuming sector in the context of rapid economic development [1]. They contribute up to 30%-40% of electricity usage at peak times, and their demand is continually growing. Many projects have exploited their potential in power system operation, such as the peak shaving pilot carried out on 2715 buildings by Jiangsu Electric Power Company in China in 2013 [2] which obtained 300 MW flexible resources. However, to gain great environmental and economic benefits, governments around the world have released a series of policies to motivate the integration of distributed energy systems at the building side [3,4]. Many buildings are equipped with combined cooling, heating and power (CCHP) [5] energy storage (ES) [6] and coupling technologies [7,8], leading to the rise of building energy systems (BESs) [9]. To date, BESs are considered the top multi-energy flexible resources, with features such as a large response potential, good regulation performance and mature control technologies [10-12]. The multi-energy flexibility measures of a BES can be divided into two parts: energy substitution [13] and demand-side management (DSM) [14]. Energy substitution measures can be classified into two categories: energy conversion and storage. The basic idea is to utilize different energy sources to fulfill the same energy demand. For example, natural gas energy can be converted to electricity or heat energy through a gas turbine (GT) or gas boiler (GB), while heat energy can be converted to cold energy by an absorption chiller (AC). In [12] building thermal storage was proven to provide great flexibility to the power grid. In [15] flexibility was greatly improved by the cascade utilization of heat energy in a low-energy residential building. On the other hand, DSM is a portfolio of measures to improve energy efficiency and change the energy consumption profile at the customer side [16]. Demand response (DR) is the most widely used category of DSM; specifically, consumers intentionally change their energy consumption profile in response to an incentive or to price signals during peaks or under extreme conditions [17]. Many studies and works have described energy management methods to leverage the multi-energy flexibility measures of BESs [18]. In general terms, the main goal of these activities is to minimize the peak demand [19] or electricity bill [20] and maximize profits or social welfare, along with other objectives. In an apartment building, the demand- and supply-side rolling strategies were implemented simultaneously to minimize the total cost [20]. In [21] an integrated DR strategy comprising energy substitution and load shifting was studied to meet additional balancing power needs in a CCHP-based BES. The thermal inertia of a district heating network and buildings has been found to enhance the absorption of wind power [7]. The demand charge reduction for commercial buildings was obtained through a combination of efficiency and flexibility measures in [19] including installing energy-efficient devices and photovoltaic systems (PVs) and applying dynamic load control strategies. The above literature mainly focuses on the reduction result of DSM in high-current periods, and some response behaviors are simplified with a bound [22] ignoring the payback effect of DSM in other periods. In practice, if the energy usage behavior is interrupted for some reason, it might have to \u201cturn on\u201d once the interruption is over, which is called the energy payback phenomenon. Reference [23] supports the argument that DSM is a process of load redistribution considering many limitations, not a single traditional generator such as a fossil power plant. To improve the impacts of DSM, such as energy comfort, the energy payback behavior will inevitably lead to another change in the load curve [24]. Furthermore, the payback phenomenon tends to occur at random according to the usage behavior or comfort demand of consumers. The optimal point determined in [25] no longer ensures optimality if the energy payback effect is not fully considered, even if it is likely to bring secondary peaks or a threat to the system stability. Consequently, the energy payback should also be considered in the flexibility evaluation of a BES. The most heavily researched DSM strategies considering payback effects are thermostatically controllable loads (TCLs) [26,27] and electric vehicles (EVs) [28,29]. After delivering response services, TCLs tend to increase the power consumption above the initial level to recover the steady-state condition. The results in [30] indicated that the payback effect could cause a new peak in the electricity system, and it was necessary to cycle the control events. The energy payback of aggregated TCLs was considered in [26] and a two-stage control model of large-scale TCLs was proposed, comprising load response and recovery. In [27] the optimal scheduling of the energy and power consumption of aggregated TCLs in multiple ancillary services was proposed considering the energy recovery effect. As a typical translational load, the energy feedback of an EV was reflected in the overall optimal scheduling [31]. In [28] a scheduling model of EV charging considering dynamic electricity prices was developed, and demand constraint charging in a fixed duration was achieved. The characteristics of the energy payback effect vary with different equipment characteristics, consumer preferences and control mechanisms. Accordingly, a realistic measure of the results of the integration of BESs should not neglect the overall effect of energy payback. To the best of our knowledge, very few works discuss the complicated dynamic interactions among different loads in the energy management of BESs. On the other hand, the building energy supplier acts as a profit-oriented operator who purchases energy in external markets and utilizes the BES to produce energy, then resells it to consumers according to retail rate schemes [32]. The supplier has two main goals: one is to ensure a comprehensive and efficient energy supply, and the other is to aggregate all the flexible resources participating in competitive markets to obtain more profit, such as by participating in peak shaving regulation [2] and balancing very short-term wind power fluctuations [21]. This study is intended to fill this gap and propose an optimal energy management strategy for smart buildings for peak shaving considering multi-energy flexibility measures, especially considering the integrated payback effect of various loads. The contributions of this paper are fourfold. \u2022 The multi-energy flexibility measures of BES are described, comprising energy substitution and DSM. From the perspective of energy redistribution, a novel dynamic two-step DSM model is represented considering the reduction and recovery process. During the first process, the load response model is built according to the linear response rate associated with real-time incentives, while the dynamic load recovery model is represented explicitly using three parameters (the recovery duration, recovery factor and recovery distribution coefficient) in a more accurate way in the second process. Additionally, the recovery feasibility and limitations are ensured by the three recovery parameters. \u2022 With profit maximization, a MILP-based energy management model is developed to optimize the operation of smart buildings for peak shaving, considering both the energy substitution and DSM measure. On the energy substitution side, the optimal strategies for energy equipment are obtained. On the DSM side, the recovery factor is predetermined as an input to represent the load characteristic, and the reasonable real-time incentives, recovery distribution coefficient and duration are optimized. \u2022 A comparison of the three cases indicates that utilizing the energy substitution and DSM measure\u2014and in particular, considering the optimization of the recovery process\u2014can tap more of the load potential and improve the peak regulation performance, significantly increasing the benefits of the building supply servicer. \u2022 We should attach importance to considering the overall recovery processes of different loads and establishing a reasonable multi-load rebound mechanism by synergistically optimizing the recovery parameters to offset the rebound effect and increase the optimization space. The outline of this paper is as follows: Section 2 describes the BES configuration, including the physical and trading structure. Section 3 describes the modeling of multi-energy flexibility measures, and the two-step response process of the DSM model is emphasized. Section 4 proposes an optimal energy management method for smart buildings for peak shaving. Section 5 presents the optimized results with a comparison of three cases. Section 6 provides further discussion of the energy payback parameters. Section 7 concludes the study. 2 BES configuration 2.1 Physical structure As a typical energy use facility, a BES can be characterized as a unit that involves the conversion, consumption, and storage of different energy carriers. The configuration varies depending on regional resources, consumer preferences, etc. To ensure applicability, the schematic layout of a BES configuration is illustrated in Fig. 1 ; this configuration is very popular in China. As shown in Fig. 1, the gas turbine (GT) system is taken as the core, and auxiliary equipment such as waste heat recovery and heat exchange devices are configured to achieve energy cascade utilization. The external grid and the ES, photovoltaic system (PV) and GT constitute the power subsystem that supplies electricity. The requirements of the heating subsystem can be met through the heat exchange (HX) and electrical boiler (EB), while the cooling requirement is fulfilled by the AC and electrical chiller (EC). The time delay due to the length of the pipe is neglected in this paper, which means it obtains a real-time balance between cooling/heating generation and demand [33]. 2.2 Trading structure The multi-energy flexibility resources of BESs can enhance the potential of peak load shifting, which can help the BESs participate in the energy market and obtain greater profit margins. Taking electricity as an example, the building energy supplier can purchase electricity from the grid or use a GT, ES or DSM to meet the energy demand; such supply flexibility means that the building has good control margin and fast response ability. Therefore, it can assist a BES participating in the peak shaving market for compensation or incentive expenses, whose trading process is shown in Fig. 2 . First, the peak shaving event (including the time and incentives) is triggered by the electricity operator according to the supply\u2013demand curve, and then it is sent to all the resource suppliers (e.g., generators and BESs). Second, the BES utilizes its own resources for multi-energy flexibility measures with the goal of maximizing profit, and then it submits the optimal bidding power to the electricity operator. Third, peak shaving is implemented, and the BES acts in accordance with the optimized operation strategies. 3 Modeling multi-energy flexibility measures 3.1 Energy substitution measures The energy balances of BES are presented in (1) to show how the energy demand is fulfilled by various energy substitution devices. (1) L t E = P t grid + P t GT + P t PV + P t ES,C - P t ES,D - P t EC - P t EB L t C = Q t EC + Q t AC L t H = Q t HX + Q t EB Here, P t grid is the tie-line power at time t , in kW. P t GT , P t PV , P t ES,C , P t ES,D , P t EC , and P t EB are the electrical power of the GT, PV, ES (charging), ES (discharging), EC and EB at time t , respectively, in kW. Q t EC and Q t AC are the cooling power of the EC and AC at time t , in kW. Q t HX , Q t EB are the heating power of the HX and EB at time t , in kW. L t E , L t C , and L t H are the electrical, cooling and heat demands at time t , respectively. The first constraint in (1) shows that a decrease in the EC, EB, or ES (discharging) output or an increase in the GT output can bring a decline in the tie-power. The second constraint in (1) shows that an increase in the AC output can lead to a decline in the EC. The third constraint in (1) shows that an increase in the HX output can lead to a decline in the EB. Next, we will introduce each energy device in detail. A. Energy conversion devices The GT is the core energy supply device; it converts natural gas into electricity and heat energy. The WH is responsible for the waste heat recovery of the GT, as shown in (2). (2) P t GT = η E GT G t GT L G / Δ t Q t GT = η E - H GT P t GT Q t WH = η WH Q t GT where Q t GT and Q t WH are the heat outputs of the GT and WH at time t , respectively, in kW. η E GT and η E - H GT are the gas-to-electric and electric-thermo conversion efficiencies of the GT, respectively, in %. η WH is the energy conversion coefficient of the WH, in %. L G is the calorific value of natural gas, set as 9.7 kW⋅h/m3. Here, the first and second constraints in (2) indicate the gas-to-electric and electric-thermo energy balance of GT, while the third constraint indicates the energy relationship of the WH. The conversion relationship among the heating and cooling devices EB, EC, AC and HX is as follows: (3) Q t EB = η EB E t EB Q t EC = η EC E t EC Q t AC = η AC Q t AC,in Q t HX = η HX Q t HX,in Q t AC,in + Q t HX,in = Q t WH where η EB , η EC , η AC , and η HX are the conversion efficiencies of the EB, EC, AC, and HX, respectively, in %. Q t AC,in and Q t HX,in are the input heat of the AC and HX at time t , respectively, in kW. Constraints 1 to 4 in (3) are the energy conversion relationships of the EB, EC, AC and HX, respectively. The fifth conversion in (3) means that the output of the WH equals the input power of the AC and HX. B. Energy storage devices The energy and charging/discharging power relation of the ES is shown in (4). (4) W t ES = W t - 1 ES ( 1 - σ ES ) + ( E t ES,C η ES,C - E t ES,D η ES,D ) Δ t where W t ES is the storage energy of ES at time t, in kWh. σ ES is the self-discharge efficiency coefficient of the ES, in %. η ES,C and η ES,D are the energy charging and discharging efficiencies of the ES, respectively, in %. The energy and power constraints of the ES are shown in (5). (5) W min ES ⩽ W t ES ⩽ W max ES W t = 0 ES = W t = T ES 0 ⩽ E t ES,C ⩽ W ES,T γ ES,C 0 ⩽ E t ES,D ⩽ W ES,T γ ES,D where W ES,T is the rated capacity of the ES, in kWh. γ ES,C and γ ES,D are the energy charging and discharging efficiencies of ES, in %. W t = 0 ES and W t = T ES indicate the storage energy of the ES when t = 0 or t = T, in kWh. Here, the first constraint in (5) describes the minimum and maximum values of the energy constraint in the ES, and the second constraint in (5) indicates that the storage energy of the ES should be maintained before and after the scheduling cycle. The third and fourth constraints in (5) are the charging and discharging power constraints of the ES, respectively. 3.2 DSM measure In a DR event, the aim of the DSM is to reduce energy consumption during peak hours while maintaining energy comfort to some extent. We can obtain sharp power or capacity reductions in some periods by providing rewards in the form of price or incentives. However, it should also be noted that consumers need to restore the responding equipment or system to the nominal state after the change, which may cause another peak. This phenomenon is called the energy payback effect. Here, the DSM measure is divided into two steps: the load response focuses on the response behavior in the peak periods, and the load recovery addresses or decreases the energy payback effect from step 1. Step 1: Load response model based on the linear response rate In the market environment, the price or incentive affects the consumer's consumption of goods as well as electricity. Here, the building energy supplier utilizes real-time incentives to encourage different loads or consumers to reduce their energy demands. We assume that the incentive is directly proportional to the response demand within a certain range [34]. i refers to the type of load. Let L i , t and L i , t ∗ denote the power of load i at time t before and after the response. The concept of the load response rate θ is introduced, and it is defined as the proportion of the response load in some period; the load response model can be approximated as a linear function, as shown in Fig. 3 and (6). (6) Δ L i , t = L i , t - L i , t ∗ = θ i , λ L i , t θ i , λ = 0 ε i ( λ i , t - λ i b ) 1 0 ⩽ λ i , t ⩽ λ i b λ i b < λ i , t ⩽ λ i m λ i , t > λ i m where Δ L i , t is the response of load i at time t , in kW; θ i , λ is the response rate of load i at incentive λ , in %; λ i , t is the real-time incentive of load i at time t , in ¥/kWh; λ i b is the dead zone incentive threshold of load i , in ¥/kWh; λ i m is the maximization incentive of load i , in ¥/kWh. ε i is the response coefficient of load i , in kWh/¥. Step 2: Load recovery model based on linear attenuation As the saying goes, every coin has two sides. The same is true for the load response, which may create a new and much higher peak during other periods. From the consumer perspective, the load response may decrease the comfort level or bring other losses. To compensate for such losses, consumers may choose to modify the load pattern beyond the DR period as quickly as they can, which is called load recovery or load rebound. This behavior decreases the natural diversity of loads, and then the payback effect phenomenon arises. In most cases, the payback power is modeled generically as a fixed proportion of the previous reduction. In [35] the payback demand is assumed to be evenly distributed over the recovery period. However, due to the nature of energy usage, it is believed that users are more likely to recover it in the time closest to the DR period, when consumer satisfaction reaches its peak. The extension of recovery periods increases the inconvenience to consumers, and the satisfaction decreases as time passes, which is the diminishing effect of load recovery. For accurate simulation, this diminishing effect must be reflected in the modeling. In addition, due to the strategy adopted and the load characteristics, the total recovery amount of DR is not necessarily equal to the initial reduction [36] and may be larger than it. Here, let the recovery factor v represents the ratio between the recovery and response power. The total recovery amount Δ L i , t \u2032 is described by (7). (7) Δ L i , t \u2032 = ν Δ L i , t , t ∈ T dr , t \u2032 ∈ T rec The recovery duration T rec is the total duration of load recovery, including the preschedule and deferring periods, and it has a highly stochastic association with the load operation and consumer comfort. The recovery strategies can be described in terms of time (when) and power (how much). Therefore, we divide the recovery duration into two parts: prescheduled and deferred recovery. Let T rec,1 and T rec,2 denote the prescheduled and deferring periods, where T rec,1 + T rec,2 = T rec . Accordingly, the recovery distribution coefficients α 1 and α 2 represent the prescheduled and deferred recovery ratios, and α 1 + α 2 = 1 . Referring to [37] a load recovery model based on linear attenuation is developed, as shown in Fig. 4 and (8). The recovery amount Δ L i \u2032 ( t , t \u2032 ) at time t \u2032 affected by the load response at time t is described in (8). (8) Δ L i \u2032 ( t , t \u2032 ) = 2 a m ( 1 + T rec , m - t \u2032 - t ) T rec , m ( T rec , m + 1 ) Δ L i , t \u2032 , t \u2032 ∈ T rec Therefore, the actual load considering the energy payback effect L i , t a at time t is (9) L i , t a = L i , t ∗ + ∑ t \u2032 Δ L i \u2032 ( t \u2032 , t ) where ∑ t \u2032 Δ L i \u2032 ( t \u2032 , t ) is the accumulation recovery load at time t caused by the energy payback at another time t \u2032 , in kW. According to the DSM characteristics, the loads in a smart building can be divided into three categories\u2014the reducible load, translatable load, and shiftable load in Fig. 5 \u2014which is different from the traditional classifications (e.g., electricity, cooling and heating loads). First, the reducible load is a kind of load that can reduce some or all of the demand without affecting other periods. Examples include lighting, sockets, and elevators. Second, the translatable load spans multiple-period production technology or flows, which requires overall translation in advance or deferral. An EV is a typical example. Third, the shiftable load has high operational flexibility within a certain period of time, as do TCLs. Its strategies include thermostat adjustment and precooling. Table 1 illustrates the recovery parameters of the three loads in a smart building. 4 Problem modeling Concentrating on the profit of the building energy supplier, a peak shaving model for a BES is proposed with multi-energy flexibility measures, combining energy substitution and a DSM. 4.1 Objective function The objective function is set to maximize the daily profit of the building energy supplier, which is the sum of the costs and revenue components; the revenue includes the energy revenue from consumers E en and the peak shaving revenue from the grid E grid , while the costs include the energy purchasing cost from grid company C grid and natural gas company C gas , the operation and maintenance expenses of all energy devices C ma and the incentive cost for consumers C inc . These are described in Fig. 6 and (10). (10) max F = E en + E grid - C grid - C gas - C ma - C inc E en = ∑ t ∈ T ρ ( L t a,E + L t a,H + L t a,C ) Δ t E grid = ρ grid Δ P grid ( t e - t s ) C grid = ∑ t ∈ T ρ t TOU P t grid Δ t C gas = ∑ t ∈ T ρ t gas P t gas Δ t C ma = ∑ t ∈ T ∑ m ∈ M κ m P t m Δ t C inc = ∑ t ∈ T dr λ t ( Δ L t E + Δ L t H + Δ L t C ) Δ t where Δ t is the time span, which has a fixed value of 1 h. ρ is the energy retail price, in ¥/kWh. L i , t a,E , L i , t a,H and L i , t a,C are the electricity, heating and cooling loads considering the DSM measures at time t , respectively, in kW. Δ L t E , Δ L t H and Δ L t C are the response electricity, heating and cooling loads at time t , respectively, in kW. Δ P grid is the declared peak shaving power, in kW. ρ grid is the peak shaving price, in ¥/kWh. t e and t s are the start and end times of peak shaving, respectively, in h. ρ t TOU and ρ t gas are the purchase prices of electricity and gas, respectively, in ¥/kWh. k m is the operation and maintenance coefficient of equipment m , m = GT, HX, EC, EB, PV, AC, WH. 4.2 Constraints 4.2.1 Load classification constraint According to the response characteristics of different loads, they can be divided into three categories, reducible loads, translatable loads, and shiftable loads, as shown in (11). (11) L t E = L t E(1) + L t E(2) L t C = L t C(3) L t H = L t H(3) The first constraint in (11) means that the electrical loads are composed of shiftable and reducible loads. The second and third constraints in (11) mean that the cooling and heating loads are translational loads. 4.2.2 Minimum and maximum values of energy devices The operation of energy devices is subject to fixed capacity limitations. (12) P min GT ⩽ P t GT ⩽ P max GT Q min GT ⩽ Q t GT ⩽ Q max GT Q min WH ⩽ Q t WH ⩽ Q max WH P min EC ⩽ P t EC ⩽ P max EC P min EB ⩽ P t EB ⩽ P max EB Q min AC,in ⩽ Q t AC,in ⩽ Q max AC,in Q min HX,in ⩽ Q t HX,in ⩽ Q max HX,in where the subscripts min and max denote the minimum and maximum values, respectively, in kW. Here, the constraints in (12) are the output power limitations of the GT/WH/EC/EB/AC/HX. 5 Recovery duration constraints based on the energy comfort level. To ensure the energy comfort level of various demands, the recovery parameters should be bounded to some extent. (13) T min rec ⩽ T rec ⩽ T max rec α 1 + α 2 = 1 where T min rec and T max rec are the minimum and maximum recovery durations, respectively. The constraints in (13) are the bounds of recovery duration and the distribution coefficient. Note that the recovery factor is predetermined by the load characteristic itself. 5.0.1 Limit of the tie-line power To guarantee that the rebound in other periods is not too large, which would adversely affect the power grid, there is an upper tie-line power limit, expressed as follows. (14) P t grid ⩽ P max base , P max base = max P t grid,b where P t grid,b is the baseline of the tie-line power, in kWh, which complies with the National Standards of the People\u2019s Republic of China GB/T32127-2015 [38]. That is, the DR baseline is equal to the average load of the first 2 nonworking days or the first 10 working days, as shown in (15). (15) Δ P grid = min ( P base grid - P t grid ) P base grid = ∑ t ∈ T dr P t grid,b / ( t e - t s ) 6 Simulation results and analysis 6.1 Inputs and assumptions To illustrate the efficiency of the proposed model, the following case studies were conducted in an office building, having an area of 4800 square meters, located in Nanjing, China. The building is owned by an electricity company and consists of one underground floor and 5 above ground floors, where the third floor is assigned as the company\u2019s cafeteria. The various electricity loads include lighting, sockets, elevators, EVs, and others. The cooling load functions in a way to maintain the room temperature within the appropriate range, in the event where the outside temperature is higher or lower than preferred. On the other hand, the heating load is to maintain the necessary hot water temperature for various areas; namely, for drinking water, cafeteria usage and bathroom services. The parameters of the BES are given in Table 2 . Various loads and photovoltaic predictive outputs are presented in Fig. 7 . The translatable load (Load II) is composed of 10 EVs with a capacity of 32 kWh and a charging power of 7 kW. The initial battery capacity obeys the normal distribution (0.5, 0.2), where the average value of 0.5 refers to 50% of the maximum battery capacity, and the initial charging time obeys the normal distribution (10:00, 15 min). The load response and recovery parameters are shown in Table 3 . The dead zone incentive thresholds are 0.4 and 0.3 for loads I and II, respectively. The economic parameters of each entity in the BES are shown in Table 4 . There exist several nonlinear variables and expressions in (6) and (8). For reducing the computational burden, a mixed integer linear model solved by general commercial optimization software is strongly recommended. A detailed description can be found in the official Gurobi website. 6.2 Results To intuitively recognize the flexibility potential of the multi-energy flexibility measures, three cases were simulated and are analyzed in Table 5 . Case 1 considers only energy substitution. On the basis of case 1, the load response is considered, while the load recovery is random. Case 3 is the proposed model, which combines both energy substitution and DSM. 6.2.1 Operation strategies All the above cases involve energy substitution measures, and the basic operation strategies are as follows (Fig. 8 ): \u2022 Electricity demand balance. In the period 0:00\u20138:00, the building is supplied by the power grid. Due to the tariff structure, the ES is charged at the maximum power of 40 kW from 4:00 to 8:00, and its storage capacity reaches 200 kWh at 8:00. During the flat-price period (after 8:00), the GT operates at 60 kW; thus, the tie-line power drops. During the peak shaving periods, the GT, PV and ES provide electricity jointly with the power grid. After 19:00, the GT decreases its output with the demand. Finally, the electricity supply is provided by the power grid only. \u2022 Heating and cooling demand balance. For a GT operating in electro-thermal mode, the heating and cooling loads are supplied by the HX and AC, respectively, while the EB and EC are supplementary. A reduction in the heating and cooling loads will directly affect the energy demand of the EB and EC and eventually affect the tie-line power. The DSM strategies and tie-line power are specifically analyzed in the three cases, as shown in Figs. 9 and 10 . Case 1: maximizing the profit through collaborative energy substitution measures. In Fig. 9(a), the electrical peak occurs at 11:00\u201314:00 and has a jagged shape, which is because the energy substitution devices cannot address all the electricity demand. Compared with the tie-line power in Fig. 7 (where all the demand is met by electricity), the tie-line power in case 1 drops from 248 kW to 67 kW, with a decrease rate of 73.0%. The energy substitution measures can effectively reduce the trading between the BES and the power grid. Let case 1 be set as the normal operation state of the BES and 67 kW be the baseline of the tie-line power [38]. Case 2: maximizing profit through energy substitution and the load response when the load recovery is random; that is, the recovery distribution coefficient is 5:5 and the duration is 1 h. After the load response begins, the degree of the response is related to the real-time incentives (Figs. 11, 5 :5), causing a sharp decrease from 67 kW (case 1) to 29 kW. However, according to the peak shaving assessment requirements in (15), the final tie-line power is 4.8 kW for the small reduction at 14:00\u201315:00. This is because 1) the initial load is higher at 80 kW during that period, and 2) the reasonable distribution of the recovery load is not considered in random mode, resulting in a cumulative stacking effect at subsequent times. In Fig. 8 (b), the peaks at 8:00\u20139:00 and 16:00\u201317:00 are mainly caused by the early rebound of the shiftable load (affecting the EC and EB) and the shift of the translatable load to nonresponse periods. Case 3: maximizing profit through energy substitution and DSM measures. The optimized results are as follows: the optimized recovery distribution coefficient is 8:2 (10:00\u201312:0) plus 1:9 (12:00\u201315:00), and the durations of the cooling and heating loads are 1 h and 1.5 h, respectively. The tie-line power is 31 kW, while the peak shaving capacity is 36 kW. The reason for this is that 1) the rebound effect on the peak shaving periods is offset by the optimized recovery distribution coefficient as much as possible while meeting the tie-line limitation (14), and 2) the recovery load is further optimized during the peak shaving periods to meet the peak shaving requirements and achieve the maximum stable flexibility. 6.2.2 Economic analysis The economic results of the peak shaving event in cases 1, 2 and 3 are shown in Table 6 . The energy revenue decreases in turn from case 1 to case 3 due to the decrease in energy demand in response to the real-time incentives. In addition, only 48¥ in revenue is obtained due to the large variation in the peak shaving capacity in case 2. On the other hand, due to the multi-load coordinated energy payback effect, the peak shaving revenue in case 3 increases to 360¥, and the total profit is 3188.9¥. 7 Further discussion of the energy payback parameters In this section, we study the different energy payback parameter effects of the shiftable load on the peak shaving capacity and profit of the BES. 7.1 Recovery distribution coefficient Assume that the recovery factor is 0.9 and the rebound duration is 1 h. As seen from Fig. 11, there is little difference in the mean value of the optimized real-time incentives under different recovery distribution coefficients; it varies between 0.83 ¥/kWh and 0.88 ¥/kWh with a concave trend. In addition, the real-time incentive is positively correlated with the recovery ratio; that is, the distribution coefficient becomes larger and the real-time incentive is greater during the periods 10:00\u201311:00 and 14:00\u201315:00, and vice versa. This is beneficial in further reducing the tie-line power in the post-peak period. In the context of real-time incentives, the BES profit shows a \u201cV-shaped\u201d characteristic under different recovery distribution coefficients. In Fig. 12 , the minimum point occurs at 5:5, and the profit is 3003.9 ¥; when the ratio is 0:1, the profit is 3168.2 ¥; and when the ratio is 1:0, the profit is 3157.3 ¥ . 7.2 Recovery factor Assume that the recovery distribution coefficient is 5:5 and the rebound duration is 1 h. Considering that the recovery factors of different loads vary greatly, the recovery factor is set to [0, 3] from the comprehensive perspective in order to analyze its influence on the real-time incentives and peak shaving effects. Figure 13 shows that the real-time incentive is high on both sides and low in the middle. This is because the rebound capacity at approximately 10:00 and 15:00 extends to the nonpeak periods, having small effects on the peak periods. If the response increases during the period 10:00\u201315:00, the recovery capacity will continue to affect the peak periods, and the peak shaving effect will be dampened. As the recovery factor goes from 0.4 to 3 in Fig. 14 , the real-time incentive gradually decreases, and the average incentive decreases from 1.96¥/kW to 0¥/kW; the average tie-line power increases gradually from 0 kW to 27.5 kW ( υ = 1.2 ) and finally approaches saturation at 33 kW ( υ = 1.5 ). This is because, under the influence of excessive rebound, the response load due to the real-time incentives is less than the new load due to the load rebound. Furthermore, this shows that the interactive influence of the load response rate and recovery factor should be comprehensively considered when scheduling various loads. 7.3 Recovery duration Assume that the recovery factor is 1 and the recovery distribution coefficient is 10:0. Figure 15 shows that the real-time incentive in the preschedule mode is relatively high on the left and relatively stable on the right, which is similar to the results of the two-way recovery distribution coefficient in Fig. 11. This is because the increase in the recovery duration greatly reduces the rebound effect, and the higher the real-time incentive is, the greater the response load will be. On the other hand, as the recovery duration increases in Figure 16 , the rebound range gradually expands, the coupling between each period is enhanced, and the average value of the real-time incentive gradually increases until it reaches the maximum value 1¥/kW and then oscillates around it. Similarly, the average tie-line power reaches 26 kW and fluctuates around it. This indicates that when the recovery duration exceeds a certain threshold, the peak shaving result will be weakly correlated with the recovery duration. Clearly, expanding the recovery duration can lead to a better way to solve the problem, but this will affect the convenience of the loads. 8 Conclusion This paper studies the problem of the optimal energy management of smart buildings for peak shaving considering multi-energy flexibility measures. The recovery process of DSM is taken into full consideration and is modeled in detail. The numerical information is analyzed via Gurobi software in three cases, and detailed results are provided and discussed. The case studies demonstrate that 1) The tie-line power can be sharply reduced by the multi-energy flexibility measures of the BES, and greater economic profit can be obtained. 2) Load recovery is an inevitable part of the DSM process, and neglecting it will lead to overestimating the response value and may even have a negative effect on the DSM target result. 3) The recovery characteristics of different loads vary greatly; they are determined simultaneously by the load itself and consumer preferences. In actual operation, we should attach importance to the complementary characteristics of the rebound between different loads and establish a reasonable multi-load recovery mechanism by optimizing the three recovery parameters to offset the rebound effect and further enhance the optimization space of DSM.

        "dc:description": "Multi-energy flexibility measures comprising energy substitution and demand-side management (DSM) can enhance the control of buildings and help them participate in the energy market, obtaining greater profit margins. However, the application of these flexibility measures is also subject to many limitations. For example, DSM is a kind of load redistribution process in which the energy payback constraints associated with comfort or usage demand should be considered. Therefore, this work studies the optimal energy management of a building energy system (BES) considering multi-energy flexibility measures, specifically under the energy payback effect, to better guide the peak shaving strategies. First, energy substitution measures are proposed involving energy conversion and storage modeling. Second, a novel dynamic two-step DSM measure is modeled for the reduction and recovery process. Then, a mixed-integer and linear programming (MILP)-based energy management model is developed to optimize the operation of smart buildings for peak shaving. The case studies demonstrate that 1) a BES can obtain better profit by utilizing multi-energy flexibility measures; 2) optimized multi-load recovery strategies can enhance the flexibility potential of a BES; and 3) a reasonable multi-load recovery mechanism should be established to offset the energy payback effect.",
