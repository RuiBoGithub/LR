Radiant cooling systems have become increasingly prevalent due to their great potential in comfort and energy saving. Nevertheless, their applications are limited by condensation and slow response. This study aims to explore the intermittent operation characteristics of radiant cooling systems and propose an effective operation strategy to improve system reliability. An operation strategy called standby cooling was proposed, and a none standby cooling scheme and four standby cooling schemes were simulated with the transient system simulation tool (TRNSYS). The results show that the none standby cooling scheme was difficult to satisfy the indoor comfort of the rooms with long shutdown periods. The indoor dry-bulb temperature and dew-point temperature when the air-conditioning mode is turned on have the approximate monotonic relationships with the maximum predicted mean vote (PMV) during the occupied period, and the Spearman correlation coefficient were 0.8809 and 0.8019, respectively. By contrast, with increased energy consumption, the standby cooling schemes can satisfy the comfort well and ensure the smooth operation of the radiant cooling system. With the same radiant system setting, the extra energy consumption of the schemes with continuous fresh air supply is 67.71%∼157.42% more than that of schemes that supply fresh air intermittently. With the same fresh air system setting, the schemes turning off the radiant cooling system need 11.67%∼71.41% more extra energy consumption than the schemes turning on the radiant system. Accordingly, from the perspective of energy consumption, one should turn off the fresh air system and turn on the radiant system as much as possible. This study provides a theoretical basis for understanding intermittent operation characteristics of radiant cooling systems and can direct the design and operation to enhance system reliability with less energy consumption. Keywords Standby cooling Radiant cooling system Intermittent operation Operation strategy System reliability 1 Introduction Building energy consumption accounts for more than 40% of global energy consumption, a large part of which is used to ensure indoor thermal comfort [1,2]. Furthermore, global electricity consumption for air conditioning was forecast to grow annually by 7% until 2030 [3]. Therefore, the researchers have paid increasing attention to optimizing air-conditioning, which is the essential part of building energy saving [4]. Moreover, air-conditioning plays a vital role in creating a comfortable living environment due to that most people spend 80%\u201390% of their time indoors [5 \u2013 7]. Optimizing the air-conditioning system to reduce energy consumption without damaging indoor thermal comfort is challenging [8], which requires an appropriate equipment configuration and an efficient operation strategy according to the characteristics of the building and equipment. In recent years, radiant cooling systems have been recognized as the preferred technology due to their higher energy saving potential and better indoor comfort than conventional convective systems [9 \u2013 14]. They have proved to have broad application prospects [15,16]. In terms of comfort, the radiant system is better than the convective system in both thermal and acoustic comfort [9,14]. The reasons can be summarized as follows: the convective system has problems such as draft sensation, noise, and large temperature gradient [17]. In contrast to the convective systems, the large radiant terminal area is conducive to providing uniform heat transfer to the room and the human body [9,12]. In addition, the air volume of the dedicated outdoor air system for radiant cooling systems is generally smaller than that for the convective system. The smaller air volume indicates slight noise and low-speed airflow. The low-speed airflow helps improve occupant comfort by avoiding large vertical temperature differences and draft sensation. Experimental results show that the actual overall dissatisfaction and unacceptability rate is much lower than the calculated predicted percentage of dissatisfied (PPD) because the radiant cooling system effectively reduces local discomfort [11]. The cooling system can be optimized to reduce energy consumption through the following methods: 1. improving the energy efficiency of equipment; 2. reducing the demand of occupants for cooling; 3. using special/better insulation configuration; 4. taking advantage of free cold sources; 5. adopting the appropriate operation schemes [13]. For the radiant cooling system, the set room temperature of the radiant cooling system under the same indoor comfort is usually higher than that of the convective cooling system [12], which reduces the demand for cooling. In addition, radiant cooling system uses high-temperature cold water to transmit cooling energy, which improves the efficiency of cooling energy distribution and production and facilitates the use of natural cold sources [12,18]. The above characteristics also indicated that radiant cooling systems have lower exergy consumption and higher second law efficiency than the convective cooling system [19 \u2013 24]. However, several factors have constrained the practical application of radiant cooling systems. Due to the disadvantages of slow response, condensation risk, and low cooling capacity [18,25], radiant cooling systems, especially in hot and humid climates with potential condensation risk, is more challenging in simulation, control, and integration [26]. When the radiant cooling system operates intermittently, indoor comfort may not be guaranteed for a long time after the air-conditioning mode is turned on [27 \u2013 30]. Moreover, the risk of condensation in the initial operation of the radiant cooling system may increase due to the continuous infiltration of outdoor hot and humid air into the room during the shutdown period [31,32]. To fix condensation problems, pre-dehumidification is often used by researchers [33 \u2013 35]. Furthermore, a feasible method is starting the system prior to occupancy to achieve preset comfort before people are excepted to enter the building [36\u201338]. This method in this paper is called pre-start. However, although most non-residential buildings have a fixed occupancy schedule [36], the occupancy of rooms is still random to a certain extent. Therefore, it is not possible to rely solely on turn on the cooling system in advance to meet the demand. Other measures should also be taken to shorten the time required to restore preset indoor comfort. An operation strategy that changes the indoor setting temperature when the room is unoccupied to save energy is often called night setback [37 \u2013 43]. When using night setback, the indoor temperature will not deviate too much from the set temperature of occupied time, which is conducive to ensuring that the time to restore the preset room comfort is not too long. However, the night setback is not fit for radiant cooling systems. When the dry-bulb temperature is the only controlled indoor parameter, the radiant system may not be started immediately to avoid condensation due to the uncontrolled indoor humidity [44 \u2013 46]. It may reduce cooling capacity and even make the preset comfort cannot be reached in the occupied period. This study is presented to explore the intermittent operation characteristics of radiant cooling systems and to propose an effective operation strategy to improve the reliability of radiant cooling systems. In order to overcome the limitations of the above existing operating strategies, this study proposed an operation strategy called standby cooling, which simultaneously controls the indoor thermal and humidity parameters during the unoccupied period. According to the standby cooling, indoor set dry-bulb temperature is raised, and indoor dew-point temperature is kept below the water supply temperature of the radiant system. Theoretically, standby cooling can make the indoor environment not too severe and guarantee the smooth operation of the radiant system. Adopting standby cooling in unoccupied periods and turning on the radiant cooling system in advance can more effectively ensure indoor comfort in occupied periods. This paper studies the operation strategy of radiant cooling systems based on the intermittent operation characteristics. The main contents include: (1) An operation strategy was proposed to simultaneously control indoor dry-bulb temperature and dew-point temperature in unoccupied periods. (2) The numerical model of an office building and its installed integrated capillary radiant cooling system with fresh air supply was established. (3) The numerical studies in this work specified the effects of the intermittent operation on the radiant cooling system. And the relationships of the thermal and humidity parameters of the indoor and outdoor air with indoor comfort are illustrated. Furthermore, the optimized schemes were given under the detailed engineering case, which further verified that the proposed operation strategy was effective and necessary for the radiant cooling system. This study provides a theoretical basis for understanding the characteristics of the intermittent operation of radiant cooling systems and provides new ideas for practical engineering. The proposed operation strategy can be employed to direct the design and operation of the radiant cooling system and helps to enhance the reliability of radiant cooling systems, especially those installed in hot and humid climates with poor building airtightness or long shutdown periods. 2 Methodology 2.1 Model description and establishment Due to the synergistic nature of radiant systems, integrated transient simulations of the building and radiant cooling system is an ideal method to examine system dynamics and to assess their energetic, exergetic, and economic performance accurately [26]. TRNSYS is a modular simulation tool that is usually used to simulate transient performances of thermal energy systems. Its ability to perform transient simulations of buildings and air-conditioning systems as a whole has made it a popular tool for simulating radiant cooling systems [47,48]. TRNSYS has a rich library of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) models, renewable energy models, and building models [26]. It also allows users to develop and run models of other building components and systems [49 \u2013 51]. Moreover, TRNSYS can directly link to other software for co-simulation [52 \u2013 54]. Users only need to comb through inputs and outputs of each component, correctly connect the components, and properly set the parameters of each component to form a complete system [55]. According to the comparison of experimental data and TRNSYS simulation results, it can be known that TRNSYS is a very reliable and accurate simulation software for convective cooling systems, radiant cooling systems, and building thermal behaviors [56 \u2013 60]. Therefore, TRNSYS is used as the simulation software for the building and the integrated radiant cooling system in this study. 2.1.1 Description of the building The building in the model is a three-story office building in Nanjing, with each story 3.5 meters high. Each floor of the building has the same functional division and heat source distribution. Take the first floor as an example: Room 101 is the comprehensive office, Room 102 is the manager's office, and Room 103 is the conference room. In addition to the above three functional areas, other areas are not equipped with air-conditioner. The building appearance and heat source distribution of the first floor is shown in Fig. 1 . Building envelope construction and additional details for windows are shown in Table 1 , and the thermal properties of the massive material layers are shown in Table 2 . The occupancy schedule is on a three-day cycle, in which each conference room is occupied only at 9:00∼11:00 on the first day. While the occupied period of each office is 8:00∼9:00 and 11:00∼20:00 on the first day, and 8:00∼20:00 on the second and third days. 2.1.2 Description of the integrated radiant cooling system The schematic diagram of the integrated radiant cooling system with fresh air supply is shown in Fig. 2 . The integrated radiant cooling system consists of the radiant system and the fresh air system. Each subsystem has an air source chiller independently. Furthermore, every floor set a fresh air unit with a sensible and latent heat exchanger. The 18 °C cold water produced by the air source chiller of the radiant system is directly sent into the capillary radiant terminal in the room to bear part of the sensible heat load. The 7 °C cold water produced by the air source chiller of the fresh air system is supplied into the cooling coil of the fresh air units. The filtered fresh air is heat and humidity exchanged with the exhaust air in the sensible and latent heat exchanger and then cooled and dehumidified through the cooling coil. After processing, the fresh air is directly sent into the room to bear the rest of the sensible heat load and all the latent heat load. When the indoor dew-point temperature of a room is higher than the water supplied temperature of the radiant system, the water supply to the room radiant terminal will be stopped immediately to avoid condensation. Because radiant cooling systems have longer response times and condensation risk [61 \u2013 63], the integrated radiant cooling system of each room is pre-start for 1 h. In the air-conditioning mode, fresh air is cooled to 12 °C and continuously supplied into the room. By control water supply to the radiant terminal on/off, the air temperature of offices is controlled at 27(±1)°C, and the air temperature of conference rooms is controlled at 26(±1)°C. To maintain the positive pressure of rooms, the exhaust air volume in the air-conditioning mode is 80% of the fresh air volume. If standby cooling is not used, both the fresh air and radiant system will be turned off when the air-conditioning mode is shut down. Four standby cooling schemes are proposed after fully considering the system characteristics and the demand for standby cooling. Under different dry-bulb temperature and dew-point temperatures, the specific operation modes of the four schemes are shown in Fig. 3 . 2.1.3 Model establishment Many modeling processes in this study, including load calculation and system design, are fully used TRNSYS. In each process, Type109-TMY2 is used to read the typical meteorological year (TMY2) database of Nanjing, China, to define input weather data. In the modeling process of the fresh air system, the maximum of the fresh air volumes calculated according to the requirements of sanitation and dehumidification were taken as the fresh air volume of each room. The outlet air relative humidity of the cooling coil is supposed as 90%, and the outlet air enthalpy is calculated through the supposed relative humidity and the already given temperature. As shown in Fig. 4 , a TRNSYS model is established to calculate the cooling capacity required by the fresh air system. This model first calculates the hourly air enthalpy of the cooling coil inlet. The hourly required cooling energy is calculated through fresh air volume and the difference of air enthalpy between the inlet and outlet of the cooling coil. Based on the model, the maximum hourly required cooling energy of the fresh air system in the whole cooling season (From June to September) is obtained. And the rated cooling capacity and water flow of the fresh air system are determined. The model used to calculate the required cooling capacity of the radiant system is shown in Fig. 5 . In this model, the multi-zone building component (Type56a) was adopted in TRNSYS to preliminarily establish the model of the entire building according to the previous description. The air-conditioning mode and the room occupancy schedules were also defined. After that, fresh air was sent into each room following the air-conditioning mode schedules to simulate the hourly cooling load of the radiant system in each room. Based on maximum hourly cooling load, the parameters of the radiant system like capillary terminal area of each room, rated cooling capacity, and the water flow rate were calculated. The control system in this model is realized by combining the control logic in the calculator, the differential controllers (Type2b), and the schedule components (Type14h). The differential controllers read the real-time indoor thermal and humidity parameters and issue the controller signals. The schedule components read simulation time and issue the schedule signals. The controller signals and the schedule signals are sent into the calculator. The control signals of each component are generated under the control logic defined by the logic statement in the calculator. As shown in Fig. 6 , a TRNSYS model was established based on the parameters obtained in the above steps and the previous description of the building and its installed cooling system. The internal model of the fresh air unit is shown in Fig. 7 . The TRNSYS Type and main parameters of the principal components in the model are shown in Table 3 . 2.2 Statistical analysis method Spearman correlation coefficient is used to measure the monotonic relationship between two variables [64]. It is widely used in the field of HVAC. For example, Ren et al. used Spearman correlation coefficient to rank the candidate motivation of window operation behavior [65]. Similarly, Huang & Li introduced Spearman correlation coefficient to reflect the degree of correlation between several building shapes and cooling and heating loads [66]. In addition, Spearman correlation coefficient was used for feature selection to determine the input variables of the artificial neural network load prediction model [67]. Spearman correlation coefficient is easy to use because it does not require the variables to be normally distributed [68]. The only important thing is the order in which each value is placed in the variable. A significant correlation exists if the corresponding values of the two variables are in the same or similar order in each group [65]. Spearman correlation coefficient can be calculated by the following formula [69]: (1) r s = ∑ i = 1 n ( R ( X i ) − R ( X ) \u203e ) ( R ( Y i ) − R ( Y ) \u203e ) ∑ i = 1 n ( R ( X i ) − R ( X ) \u203e ) 2 ∑ i = 1 n ( R ( Y i ) − R ( Y ) \u203e ) 2 Where n is number of sample data, X i is each value of one of the variables, and R ( X i ) represents the rank of X i , where each rank is an integer representing the relative size. While R ( X ) \u203e represents the average of the rank corresponding to each value of the variable. Similarly, Y i is each value of another variable, and R ( Y i ) is the rank of Y i . While R ( Y ) \u203e is the average of the rank corresponding to each value of another variable. The value range of this index is [-1,1], and the larger the absolute value is, the closer the correlation is between the two variables [70]. When the index value is 0, there is no correlation between the two variables [71]. When the index is −1 or 1, there is a perfect negative or positive correlation between the two variables. 3 Result and discussion 3.1 Characteristics and problems of intermittent operation The simulation results of the none standby cooling scheme of indoor dry-bulb temperature and PMV of each room in the whole cooling season are shown in Fig. 8 . As shown in the figure, room 303 has the highest indoor temperature during the unoccupied period because it is located on the top floor and has a long unoccupied period. Besides, room 303 has the worst indoor temperature control of all rooms. It often fails to bring the room temperature down to the set range in the occupied periods. Temperature deviations also make the PMV and PPD of Room 303 often fail to meet Class B requirements of ISO Standard 7730 [72]. From the above analysis, room 303 is the most challenging room in the whole building to ensure indoor comfort in the occupied period. In order to find out the problems existing in the intermittent operation of the integrated radiant cooling system, a comprehensive analysis of the simulation results of room 303 is given below. The relevant simulation results of room 303 without standby cooling are shown in Fig. 9 . As shown in Fig. 9a, sometimes the indoor dew-point temperature when the air-conditioning mode is turned on ( t d , i n ) is extremely high that the indoor dew-point temperature cannot be reduced to 18 °C in the whole air-conditioning period. In this condition, the decrease of indoor dry-bulb temperature is significantly impeded. The room dry-bulb temperature is much higher than the set temperature even until the end of the conference. The indoor comfort (PMV-PPD) of room 303 during occupied periods is shown in Fig. 9b. It can be seen from the figure that even the air-conditioning mode is turned on 1 h in advance, the room is still difficult to meet the comfort requirements of the occupied period in the severe weather period (about 4500∼6000 h). It can be seen from Fig. 9a and b that when t d , i n is too high, the indoor comfort during the occupied period will deteriorate significantly. However, when t d , i n is relatively low, the variation trends of PMV are very similar to that of indoor dry-bulb temperature when the air-conditioning mode is turned on ( t i n ). Fig. 9c shows the duration that the radiant system cannot be turned on in the air-conditioning mode ( D ) on each conference day and the outdoor air thermal and humidity parameters in the whole cooling season. It can be seen that the dew-point temperature of outdoor air is closely related to the length of D . By contrast, the relationship between outdoor dry-bulb temperature and the length of D is less clear. As shown in whole Fig. 9, D is strongly related to t d , i n and the deterioration degree of room comfort. To sum up, indoor and outdoor thermal and humidity parameters all have a certain influence on the smooth operation of the radiant system and indoor comfort. Although some qualitative conclusions can be drawn from the above analysis, a quantitative basis is still lacking. Thus, it is not easy to accurately evaluate the influence degree of each influencing factor on comfort and system operation. In order to explore the intermittent operation characteristics of the radiant cooling system in more depth, the correlations between variables are analyzed by statistical method. Fig. 10 shows the Spearman correlation coefficients ( r s ) between six variables. Four of the variables are indoor and outdoor thermal and humidity parameters when the air-conditioning mode is turned on, including outdoor dry-bulb temperature ( t o u t ), outdoor dew-point temperature ( t d , o u t ), indoor dry-bulb temperature ( t i n ), and the indoor dew-point temperature ( t d , i n ). The other two variables are the duration that the radiant system cannot be turned on in the air-conditioning mode ( D ) and the maximum PMV during the occupied period ( P M V m a x ) of each conference day. All the correlation coefficients of Fig. 10 passed the significance testing. As shown in Fig. 10, the two variables that have the closest monotone relationship with P M V m a x are t i n and t d , i n , which correlation coefficients are respectively 0.8809 and 0.8019. It indicates that indoor thermal and humidity parameters when the air-conditioning mode is turned on significantly impact indoor comfort during the occupied period. The effect of t i n on P M V m a x is that higher indoor dry-bulb temperature represents more room heat storage, which leads to longer cooling time and may be accompanied by higher indoor average radiant temperature. The influence of t d , i n on P M V m a x is mainly due to higher t d , i n leads to longer D (the correlation coefficient of t d , i n and D is as high as 0.9921). When the radiant system cannot be turned on, the cooling capacity of the integrated radiant cooling system cannot be fully exerted, which extends the time to restore the preset indoor comfort. To make the matter worse, suppose the dehumidification is not completed before the occupancy. The moisture gain from occupants will significantly impede the indoor dew-point temperature decline, which is the main reason for the few abnormally high values of PMV, PPD, and D in Fig. 9b and c. Such a severe deviation from the comfort range is unacceptable. In other words, although the correlation coefficient between t d , i n and P M V m a x is lower than that between t i n and P M V m a x , when t d , i n is above a certain limit, it will have a more severe impact on indoor comfort. Besides, the correlation coefficients of t o u t and t d , o u t with D were respectively as high as 0.8702 and 0.9206, and the correlation coefficients with P M V m a x were respectively 0.7165 and 0.7576. The high correlation coefficients indicate that the outdoor thermal and humidity parameters when the air-conditioning mode is turned on greatly impacted the smooth operation of the radiant system and indoor comfort. It is because the outdoor thermal and humidity parameters can significantly influence the indoor thermal and humidity parameters, the performance of the integrated radiant cooling system, etcetera. To sum up, indoor and outdoor thermal and humidity parameters when the air-conditioning mode is turned on significantly influence the smooth operation of the radiant system and indoor comfort. The influence of indoor thermal and humidity parameters is more remarkable than that of outdoor. In general conditions, the t i n has the most significant influence on indoor comfort. However, if the t d , i n exceeds a specific limit, the indoor comfort will deteriorate significantly. In addition, the indoor dew-point temperatures of the three conference rooms are basically the same because they have the same setting except for the envelope structure. In other words, the conference rooms on the first and second floors also usually have excessively high indoor dew-point temperatures. As shown in Fig. 8a, the indoor temperature of the unoccupied period of the conference rooms on the first and second floors never exceeded 30 °C. However, the indoor comfort of the occupied period deviated synchronously from that of the third floor at least at 5049∼5051 h and 5409∼5411 h. It indicates that only controlling the indoor dry-bulb temperature in the unoccupied period was not enough to guarantee the indoor comfort of the occupied period. Therefore, in order to ensure the smooth operation of radiant systems and indoor comfort, it is necessary to control the indoor dry-bulb temperature and dew-point temperature simultaneously during the unoccupied period. 3.2 Comparison of standby cooling schemes Four different standby cooling schemes were taken for room 303 in the severe weather period were simulated respectively. Take a typical period (5000∼5150 h) for example, the variation of room temperature, relative humidity, and dew-point temperature of these four schemes were shown in Fig. 11 . The comfort of occupied time in 4500∼6000 h is shown in Fig. 12 . The comparison of energy consumption and cooling energy of each standby cooling scheme with that of the none standby cooling scheme is shown in Fig. 13 . As shown in Fig. 11, the schemes all can satisfy the requirement that indoor dry-bulb temperature no more than 30 °C and dew-point temperature no more than 18 °C. However, only the relative humidity of scheme 3 almost has always been in a suitable range; the rest of the schemes often appear a low relative humidity status, which may cause the waste of energy. Under scheme 1 and scheme 2, the excessive dehumidification is caused by fresh air at 18 °C (or 12 °C) dry-bulb temperature being continuously supplied into the room. Under scheme 4, the excessive dehumidification is caused by maintaining the indoor dry-bulb temperature only relies on the fresh air system. As shown in Fig. 12, after standby cooling is adopted, the indoor comfort of room 303 under all schemes is meet perfectly. The PMV and PPD meet Class A in ISO Standard 7730 on almost all conference days. It is because the radiant system can be turned on immediately when switching to the air-conditioning mode in each standby cooling scheme. That avoids the cooling capacity reduction after switching to the air-conditioning mode due to the excessively high indoor dew-point temperature. It shows that the standby cooling mode effectively ensures indoor comfort in the occupied period with reasonable pre-start. In addition, the conference days with relatively high P M V m a x in room 303 under each standby cooling scheme are almost not in the three most severe weather periods (including about 4500 h∼4600 h, 5000\u20135100 h, and 5350\u20135550 h). The relatively high P M V m a x often occurs when the dry bulb temperature and dew point temperature are relatively low. This is mainly because the radiant system is not turned on in advance when the dry-bulb temperature of the room does not reach the preset upper limit before the occupancy. It leads to the high mean radiant temperature and PMV of the room. From another perspective, the proposed control strategy is very suitable for severe weather. Pre-dehumidification and pre-start are widely used for the radiant cooling system with intermittent operation. Nevertheless, similarly for under the premise of pre-start for 1 h, the standby cooling schemes can meet the occupied period's comfort requirements on every conference day. While the none standby cooling scheme often deviates from the preset comfort level. The studies listed below may contribute to a better understanding of the limitations of pre-dehumidification and pre-start and the effectiveness of the control strategies proposed in this paper. Pi et al. used TRNSYS to establish a radiant cooling system simulation model. This model simulated the indoor dew-point temperature variations under different dehumidification air volumes when the pre-dehumidification time was given. Meanwhile, it simulated the radiant surface temperature variation. They compared the dew-point temperature with the radiant surface temperature and obtained the optimal pre-dehumidification air volume that just met the requirements of dehumidification [34]. Jin et al. used a computational fluid dynamics model to simulate the time required for pre-dehumidification. The simulation results showed that when the indoor humidity was about 16.3 g/kg(a), about 25min of pre-dehumidification time was needed to reduce the air moisture content to the design value [35]. The above study shows that the dew-point temperature of the room air when the system is started, the pre-dehumidification time, and dehumidification air volume all influence the effectiveness of pre-dehumidification. Furthermore, the pre-start of this study needs to reduce the indoor dew-point temperature to below the water supply temperature before turning on the radiant system, so the time required for pre-start will not be less than the time required pre-dehumidification. In the simulation of this paper, the maximum indoor dew-point temperature is 29.28 °C, and the corresponding humidity is as high as 26.05 g/kg(a). In practice, such extreme indoor humidity is possible to occur in rooms in hot, humid climates, especially those with poor airtightness and prolonged downtime of fresh air systems. However, due to the randomness of the occupancy of the room, it is not guaranteed to set aside enough pre-dehumidification or pre-start time. In order to ensure the smooth operation of the radiant system and indoor comfort during occupancy and improve the system reliability, it is essential to control the indoor thermal and humidity parameters during unoccupied periods. As shown in Fig. 13a and b, the increase of total energy consumption and total cooling energy can be attributed to the increase of the energy consumption and cooling energy of the fresh air system to a large extent. In contrast, the energy consumption and cooling energy of the radiant system change very little. From the perspective of energy consumption, compared with the scheme without standby cooling, the energy consumption of the four schemes increases to varying degrees. Among them, the total extra energy consumption of scheme 3 is the least, which is 212.62 kWh, only 58.34% of scheme 4, 38.85% of scheme 1, and 34.79% of scheme 2. From the perspective of cooling energy, the total extra cooling energy of scheme 3 is also the least of all standby cooling schemes, which is 587.65 kWh, only 73.37% of scheme 1, 60.70% of scheme 4, and 56.53% of scheme 2. Therefore, with the same radiant system settings, the total extra energy consumption and total extra cooling energy of the schemes with continuous fresh air supply are more than those with intermittent fresh air supply. Among which the total extra energy consumption is 67.71%∼157.42% more, and the total extra cooling energy is 7.37%∼36.29% more. Furthermore, with the same fresh air system settings, the total extra energy consumption and total extra cooling energy of the scheme without the radiant system operation are 11.67%\u201371.41% and 29.79%\u201364.75% more than those of the scheme with the radiant system operation, respectively. As can be known from the above results, to reduce energy consumption, one should turn off the fresh air system and turn on the radiant system as far as possible. Fig. 13c shows the details of the energy consumption changes of the fresh air system. From the point of energy consumption of the fans, the extra energy consumption of scheme 4 is the highest, which is higher than that of scheme 2, which continuously supplies fresh air but does not turn on the radiant system. This is mainly because scheme 4 needs to turn on both the supply fan and the exhaust fan when the fresh air system is started, while scheme 2 sometimes only needs to turn on the supply fan. In terms of pump energy consumption, the energy consumption of the fresh air system in scheme 1 and scheme 2 is significantly increased compared with that in scheme 3 and scheme 4. This is because scheme 1 and scheme 2 require the constant speed pump of the fresh air system to operate continuously, which causes a certain amount of energy waste. In addition, the energy consumption of the chiller in the fresh air system also greatly influences the total energy consumption of the fresh air system. The schemes that continuously supply fresh air will have higher chiller energy consumption for the fresh air system, regardless of whether the radiant system is turned on or not. Variations in the energy consumption of the pumps of the radiant system in each scheme largely reflect the changes in the operating time of the radiant system in Room 303. As shown from Fig. 13d, under the premise that the fresh air system provides increased cooling energy, the energy consumption of the pump in the radiant system of each scheme still increases to varying degrees. The increased energy consumption of the pump indicates that standby cooling avoided the high indoor dew-point temperature, made the radiant system can be turned on immediately, thus prolonged the operation time of radiant system. In general, if there is no special requirement, scheme 3 should be selected due to it without excessive dehumidification and with the least energy consumption. However, if there is a need to keep the positive indoor pressure, scheme 1 should be chosen because of its relatively small energy consumption. 4 Conclusions In this paper, an operation strategy of radiant cooling systems based on intermittent operation characteristics is proposed, which provides a breakthrough point for improving the reliability of radiant cooling systems. TRNSYS is selected to build a simulation model of an office building and its installed integrated radiant cooling system with fresh air supply for the convenience and accuracy of modeling. Five different operation schemes were respectively simulated. The characteristics and existing problems of the intermittent operation of the radiant cooling system were studied and analyzed. The influence of indoor and outdoor thermal and humidity parameters on the operation of the radiant cooling system and indoor comfort was analyzed using Spearman correlation coefficient, which is an easy-to-use indicator to evaluate the monotonic relationship between two variables and is widely used in the field of HVAC. The rationality and necessity of the proposed operation strategy were verified, and the best standby cooling scheme of the integrated radiant cooling system in the simulation model under different requirements was obtained based on energy consumption analysis. The main conclusions can be summarized as follows: (1) Without standby cooling, the three largest variables of r s between P M V m a x are t i n (0.8809), t d , i n (0.8019) and D (0.7964), respectively. Moreover, there is a strong correlation between t d , i n and D , with r s as high as 0.9921. In other words, the indoor thermal and humidity parameters when the air-conditioning mode is turned on have a strong impact on the smooth operation and indoor comfort. When the radiant cooling system is operating intermittently, it is necessary to control the dry-bulb temperature and dew-point temperature simultaneously in the unoccupied period to ensure indoor comfort and the smooth operation of radiant systems. (2) From the perspective of operation effect, each standby cooling scheme can well control the indoor thermal and humidity parameters, limit the room heat storage and ensure the smooth operation of the radiant system. From the perspective of comfort, indoor comfort is well met even in severe weather after adopting standby cooling. There is no significant difference in the PMV-PPD in the occupied period under different standby cooling schemes. After the integrated radiant cooling system in intermittent operation adopts standby cooling, indoor comfort in the occupied period and smooth operation of the radiant system can be guaranteed with a reasonable pre-start time. (3) With the same radiant system settings, the total extra energy consumption and total extra cooling energy of the schemes with continuous fresh air supply are more than those of the schemes with intermittent fresh air supply. Among which the total extra energy consumption is 67.71%∼157.42% more, and the total extra cooling energy is 7.37%∼36.29% more. Furthermore, with the same fresh air system settings, the total extra energy consumption and total extra cooling energy of the scheme without the radiant system operation are 11.67%\u201371.41% and 29.79%\u201364.75% more than those of the scheme with the radiant system operation, respectively. As can be concluded from the above results, if there is no need to maintain positive indoor pressure, one should turn off the fresh air system and turn on the radiant system as far as possible to reduce energy consumption. This study provides a theoretical basis for understanding the characteristics of the intermittent operation of radiant cooling systems and provides new ideas for practical engineering. The proposed operation strategy can be employed to direct the design and operation of the radiant cooling system and helps to enhance the reliability of radiant cooling systems, especially those installed in hot and humid climates with poor building airtightness or long shutdown periods. However, there are two limitations in this study that could be addressed in future research. Firstly, in some weather conditions, controlling the indoor dry bulb temperature alone may be sufficient to ensure comfort during occupancy. Additional control of indoor dew point temperature may result in wasted energy. Secondly, although the randomness of room occupancy in actual use is considered in this paper, 1 h for pre-start is still carried out. Such a long pre-start time may not exist in actual engineering. In future work, we will conduct in-depth research on the case that there is no opportunity for pre-start, figure out optimal controlled parameters in different weather conditions, and predict the optimal controlled parameters through machine learning.

        "dc:description": "Radiant cooling systems have become increasingly prevalent due to their great potential in comfort and energy saving. Nevertheless, their applications are limited by condensation and slow response. This study aims to explore the intermittent operation characteristics of radiant cooling systems and propose an effective operation strategy to improve system reliability. An operation strategy called standby cooling was proposed, and a none standby cooling scheme and four standby cooling schemes were simulated with the transient system simulation tool (TRNSYS). The results show that the none standby cooling scheme was difficult to satisfy the indoor comfort of the rooms with long shutdown periods. The indoor dry-bulb temperature and dew-point temperature when the air-conditioning mode is turned on have the approximate monotonic relationships with the maximum predicted mean vote (PMV) during the occupied period, and the Spearman correlation coefficient were 0.8809 and 0.8019, respectively. By contrast, with increased energy consumption, the standby cooling schemes can satisfy the comfort well and ensure the smooth operation of the radiant cooling system. With the same radiant system setting, the extra energy consumption of the schemes with continuous fresh air supply is 67.71%∼157.42% more than that of schemes that supply fresh air intermittently. With the same fresh air system setting, the schemes turning off the radiant cooling system need 11.67%∼71.41% more extra energy consumption than the schemes turning on the radiant system. Accordingly, from the perspective of energy consumption, one should turn off the fresh air system and turn on the radiant system as much as possible. This study provides a theoretical basis for understanding intermittent operation characteristics of radiant cooling systems and can direct the design and operation to enhance system reliability with less energy consumption.",
