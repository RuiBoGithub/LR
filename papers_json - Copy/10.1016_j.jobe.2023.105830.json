Therefore, the control of air conditioning systems has always been an important research topic. Artificial neural network (ANN) and genetic algorithm (GA) are two commonly used intelligent control methods. However, there is no guidance until now on the applicability of these two control methods and how to make a choice between them in the control of air conditioning systems. In this study, an ANN control strategy and a GA control strategy were developed and experimentally verified. The experimental results indicated that both the ANN control strategy and the GA control strategy could control the air conditioning system properly under different control commands. To compare the control performances, the convergence speed, discrete characteristic, energy consumption and interference resistance ability were calculated or experimentally validated. The ANN control strategy showed better performances in the convergence speed and energy consumption. While the GA control strategy performed better in maintaining the stable state of the air conditioning system. The innovation of this study lies in two points. First, when designing the ANN control strategy and the GA control strategy, ANN and GA were applied as the central control algorithm, rather than only as auxiliary algorithms for system identification, prediction or optimization. This methodology is relatively novel in the design of ANN and GA control strategies for the air conditioning system, and could further expand the application of ANN and GA.

The direct expansion air conditioning system studied in this paper are the most widely used air conditioning systems. However, the control of air conditioning systems has always been an important research topic since the air conditioning system is a complex nonlinear multiple-input multiple-output system. To control the air conditioning system, various control strategies have been designed and experimentally validated. For example, a capacity controller applying direct digital control strategy was built, and into which a traditional proportional controller was incorporated [1]. The core component of this control strategy was a numerical calculation algorithm established. A multi-input and multi-output control strategy was designed to further improve the indoor air quality by Qi and Deng [2]. This controller needs a linearized mathematical model, which makes the control strategy more difficult. Xu developed a series of control strategies for the air conditioning system. His work included the on-off control strategy for a multi-evaporator air conditioning system [3], a steady-state modeling-based control strategy for the air conditioning system [4], and the weight setting rules of the fuzzy logic control algorithm [5]. The fuzzy logic control strategy was also widely used in the intelligent control of the air conditioning system. Li et al. [6,7] adopted fuzzy logic principles for the purpose of decoupling the control loops of humidity and temperature, in which two controllers based on fuzzy logic for the air conditioning system were designed, one used ANN to model the system [6] and the other used proportional derivative control law to simplify the controller [7]. Yan et al. [8,9] further improved the fuzzy logic control strategy for the air conditioning system by proposing an inherent operational feature-based fuzzy logic control strategy [8] and a thermal comfort aided fuzzy logic control strategy [9]. The above-mentioned control strategies for the air conditioning system are mostly based on the traditional control methods. However, the intelligent control methods are more obvious in terms of simplifying the modeling process, improving the environmental adaptability and system intelligence. ANN and GA are the two most commonly used intelligent control methods, which have been successfully applied to control problems in different research fields. ANN was employed to the air conditioning system control because of the difficulties in physical modeling and the limitation in controllable range. Li et al. [10,11] developed an online adaptive controller using ANN to control the indoor environment of a space served by the air conditioning system, in which the ANN specialized online training algorithm was applied. However, the exactly application of ANN as a control actuator to control the air conditioning system is still limited in the existing literature. In most instances, ANN was used for modeling and prediction. Even if it is used in control, ANN only plays the role of system identification and prediction, or parameter optimization of the controller. Take the ANN based predictive control strategy as an example, the role of ANN is to predict the performances of the system in the form of a model. Lei and Liu [12] proposed a predictive control strategy based on radial basis function ANN for a multi-zone variable air volume air conditioning system, based on a multi-zone building model. Meng et al. [13] built a demand response control strategy for the thermal energy storage air conditioning system based on a prediction model developed using the Elman ANN. In this control strategy, ANN was used to predict the system load, and the particle swarm optimization algorithm was involved for optimizing the load forecasting. Sholahudin et al. [14] evaluated the operating performances of the air conditioning system based on ANN. The results showed that the ANN model developed could successfully estimate the cooling capacity of the air conditioning system under different inside or outside operating conditions. GA is also a commonly used intelligent control method. Its advantage lies in the global searching ability, so when GA is applied to system control, its optimization ability is inseparable. GA is considered to be an efficient method for solving complex optimization problems and is widely used in various control problems. GA has been successfully applied in the control of the air conditioning system. The studies of Huang et al. [15] proposed a control strategy for the multistage constant compressor speed air conditioning system based on GA to maintain the passenger cabin thermal comfort and save energy simultaneously. In this control strategy, the speeds of compressor were optimized by GA. Hu and Xiao [16] developed an indoor environment model and an inverter air conditioner model to evaluate the thermal performance of the conditioned space. In this control strategy, GA was applied for optimal solution searching. Mossolly et al. [17] studied the optimal control strategies of a variable air volume air conditioning system for the purpose of insuring thermal comfort and indoor air quality. The optimization problem in this control strategy was solved using genetic algorithm. In the works of Parameshwaran [18], the fuzzy genetic optimization algorithm was used to control the energy conservative building air conditioning system. With this control strategy, better thermal comfort and indoor air quality could be obtained without increasing energy consumption. Wang and Jin [19] proposed a control strategy for a variable air volume air conditioning system based on the prediction of the system environment responses and the energy consumption changes to the control command. In this control strategy, GA was applied to online optimize the multiple parameters of the control strategy. The application of GA in the air conditioning system is not limited to control, but also includes system performance optimization [20], prediction [21] and optimal design [22]. Based on the above literature review, we could find the following gaps in research: (1) The application of ANN and GA in air conditioning system mainly lies in modeling, prediction and optimization, and the application in control strategy is relatively limited. Therefore, exploring the control strategies based on ANN and GA in the air conditioning system is still an important research topic. Furthermore, ANN and GA are rarely used as the central control algorithm in the control strategies. Therefore, the control strategy with ANN and GA as the central control algorithm applied in the air conditioning system is a novel research direction. (2) In the existing literature, there is no comparative study on the control performance of ANN control strategy and GA control strategy. Therefore, although both ANN and GA can be used in controlling the air conditioning system, the performance applicability of the two in control is still a research gap, and there is also a lack of guidance when making choices between ANN control strategy and GA control strategy in practical applications. There are two research objectives in this paper. One is to design two control strategies based on ANN and GA respectively for the air conditioning system. In these two control strategies, both ANN and GA are used as central control algorithms, so as to further expand the application of ANN and GA in air conditioning system control. The other is to compare the control performance of the ANN control strategy and the GA control strategy from different perspectives, obtain the applicability of them in controlling the air conditioning system, and provide guidance for the selection of the two control strategies in practical applications. 2 Development of the control strategies 2.1 ANN control strategy An ANN is a mathematical model for information processing, and its structure is similar to the synaptic connections of the brain. Its construction concept is inspired by the operation of biological neural network functions. ANN is an operational processing model that consists of a huge number of neurons and interconnected connections. Each neuron represents a specific activation function. The connection between each two neurons is the weight, which represents a weighted value for the information passing through the connection. The output of the ANN varies according to the connection pattern, the weight value and the activation function of the ANN. ANN has the features of self-adaptation, self-learning, nonlinear mapping, robustness and fault tolerance. Therefore, for online control of complex nonlinear systems that are difficult to accurately model, traditional control methods based on accurate models cannot be used, while ANN can meet the requirements. ANN can be used for model identification, optimization calculation, or as a controller in system controlling. In the current study, ANN not only performs model identification, but also acts as a control actuator. The operating principle of the ANN control strategy is illustrated in Fig. 1 . The ANN control strategy is consisted of two main components. One is the system identification model, and the other is the ANN online control actuator. The system identification model is established by training an ANN using the dynamic experiment data collected. These experimental data could reflect the real time operating characteristics of the air conditioning system. Thus, the ANN offline trained in advance could predict the system output. The system identification model plays two roles in the control process, one is to predict the output of the air conditioning system, and the other is to predict the gradient of the control deviation. The ANN control actuator is an ANN inverse model which was trained beforehand and online updated using the ANN control algorithm. The inputs to the ANN control algorithm are the control command, the outputs from the air conditioning system steps time ahead, and control outputs steps time ahead. In the schematic diagram of the ANN control strategy, the solid lines show the data transmission route during control, and the dotted lines show the updating process during control. In order to accommodate to the changing operating conditions of the controlled system, the ANN control strategy has two online updating programs. One is to update the weights of the ANN forward model online according to the model prediction deviation, ensuring that the updated system identification model could always reflect the real time operating characteristics of the controlled system. The other is to update the ANN inverse model working as the ANN control actuator according to the control deviation. The process of updating the ANN inverse model is also the process of command following control. The aim of the ANN control actuator is to minimize the control deviation, which is the difference between the control command and the system output, therefore we define the variable D as below: (1) D = 1 2 ∑ i ( y s i − c i ) 2 where y s is the output from the controlled system, and c is the control demand. In the current study, the outputs from the air conditioning system are indoor air dry bulb temperature and wet bulb temperature: (2) y s = [ T d , T w ] (3) c = [ T d c , T w c ] The gradient descent of D is calculated to online update the weights of the ANN inverse model using the following equation: (4) W ( t + 1 ) = W ( t ) − η ∂ D ∂ W ( t ) where W is the weights of the ANN inverse model, t is the time step, and η is the gradient descent coefficient. In this equation, the value of the gradient descent of D could be calculated as below: (5) ∂ D ∂ W = ∂ D ∂ y s ∂ y s ∂ c ∂ c ∂ W The value of ∂ D ∂ y s could be calculated as follows: (6) ∂ D ∂ y s = ∑ i ( y s i − c i ) The calculation of ∂ y s ∂ c is difficult since the relationship between the outputs and inputs of the air conditioning system under dynamic operating conditions is complicated. Therefore, we could use the system identification model developed to evaluate the value of ∂ y s ∂ c as follows: (7) ∂ y s ( t + 1 ) ∂ c ( t ) ≈ ∂ y p ( t + 1 ) ∂ c ( t ) where y p refers to the predicted results calculated by the system identification model as shown below: (8) y p = [ T d p , T w p ] The task of the ANN online control algorithm as seen in the first block in the control block diagram is to obtain the control output of the control strategy. The control output is then input to the air conditioning system as seen in the second block. The task of the system identification model is to calculate the value of ∂ y p ∂ c , since the updating of the ANN inverse model need this value, as shown in equations (1)\u2013(8). More details of the ANN online control algorithm were reported in the author's previous studies, see Refs. [11,23]. The offline training process of system identification model and inverse ANN model was reported in Ref. [23], and the network layers chosen is 2-6-6-2, which with the most superior performances as shown in the previous study. In the GA optimization algorithm, the calculation process was finished using the MATLAB Genetic Algorithm and Direct Search Toolbox. The process of control is described in Fig. 2 . After beginning of the control process, the control demand is introduced to the controller and could be altered at any time. The ANN online control actuator startup and obtain a combination of compressor speed and fan speed. The difference between the actual outputs of the air conditioning system experimentally recorded and the predicted outputs of the air conditioning system calculated by the system identification model are used to update the system identification model. Then the updated system identification model is used to calculate the control deviation gradient which is involved in the updating of the ANN inverse model. Since the update of the system identification model and the ANN inverse model spend certain time, there exist time delay in the ANN control strategy. Therefore, the time duration between one control action and the next control action must be longer than the time spend for calculating the value of ∂ y p ∂ c and updating the system identification model and the inverse ANN model. In the current study, the online control actuator was set to act every 1 min, which was proved to be satisfied for time delay by experiments. During the time interval, the compressor speed and fan speed were remained unchanged. In this figure, τ is the time duration of control, h, counter of control action, l, the number of data sets used for updating the system identification (l was set at 10 in this study). The procedure of ANN model development for ANN control strategy has been reported in the author's previous study, see Ref. [11] for detail. For the completeness of the current paper, these are briefly reproduced. The procedure of ANN control strategy includes five steps: 1) train the inverse ANN model and the system identification model using the offline collected experimental data before the process of control; 2) in the process of control, calculate ∂ y p ∂ c using the offline trained system identification model before enough online data was collect, and the system identification model was not updated during this period; 3) update the inverse ANN model using the ∂ y p ∂ c calculated by the offline trained system identification model and calculate the compressor speed and fan speed; 4) when enough online data was collected, train the system identification model online and calculate ∂ y p ∂ c using the updated system identification model; 5) update the inverse ANN model using the ∂ y p ∂ c calculated by the updated system identification model and calculate the compressor speed and fan speed. From these five steps we could see that the inverse ANN model was initially offline trained and updated every time step using equations (1)\u2013(8). The role of system identification model in ANN control strategy is to calculate the value of ∂ y p ∂ c in equation (7), and then help the online updating of the inverse ANN model. During the initial period of the control process (10 min in the current study), the system identification model was not updated. When enough online experimental data was collected, the system identification model will be updated regularly. Detailed modeling procedure of the system identification model was reported in the author's previous work, see Ref. [23]. The modeling procedure of system identification model consists of the following 4 steps: 1) train the system identification model using the offline collected experimental data beforehand; 2) keep the system identification model not updated during the initial period of the control; 3) after enough experimental data was collected online, update the system identification model using the online collected data; 4) keep the experimental data used up to date, eliminate the old data, and continuously update the system identification model with the latest data. 2.2 GA control strategy GA is an optimization searching algorithm based on population. During the process of GA evolution, the diversity of population can be maintained, and will make it easy to converge on the global optimum. In this study, GA was applied to find out the optimal combination of control actions, i.e., the compressor speed and fan speed. Different control actions will lead to different indoor air conditions on the basis of the current indoor thermal conditions. Therefore, the process of control is aiming at seeking the optimal combinations of control actions, so that the optimized values of fitness functions can be obtained. In this sense, the process of control is in line with the operating process of GA. Fig. 3 shows the corresponding relationships between GA parameters and the controlling process. A chromosome in GA represents a particular set of control actions, and shown as a set of 2 integers, which means a chromosome has two genes on it. All the possible combinations of control actions form the population in GA. The task of GA in the GA control strategy is to find out the particular optimal combination of control actions under the operational conditions and constraint conditions. The fitness function was used to estimate the ability of individuals of each generation to adapt the environments and survive in GA, corresponding to the criteria for assessing the optimal control variables. In this study, the mathematical expression of fitness function, which is minimized by GA is as follows: (9) F F ( t ) = | y p ( t + 1 ) − c ( t + 1 ) | The operating principle of the GA control strategy is illustrated as below in Fig. 4 . The GA control strategy is consisted of two main parts. One is the system identification model, and the other is the GA optimization algorithm acting as the online control actuator. Here, the system identification model in the GA control strategy is the same as that in the ANN control strategy. The system identification model plays two roles in the control process, one is to predict the outputs of the air conditioning system, and the other is to predict the values of fitness function to assist the optimization searching process of GA. During the process of control under GA control strategy, the system identification model will be online updated according to the difference between the actual outputs of the air conditioning system and the predicted results calculated by the system identification model. Besides, the GA optimization program could online adjust the control actions to the air conditioning system by minimizing the value of fitness function. The value of the fitness function was calculated by the online updated system identification model. The operating process of the GA control strategy is shown in Fig. 5 . In this figure, n is the number of control circuit, and x is the control actions, shown as follows: (10) x = [ S c , S f ] When n = 1, the initial population of GA is randomly created. After that, the result obtained by GA will be used as the initial population for the next time step. The GA optimization program, as shown in a dotted line box in Fig. 5, is described in detail in Fig. 6 . The GA optimization program includes the following steps: i) creating initial population; ii) calculating the value of fitness function for each chromosome; iii) proceeding the selective operation; iv) proceeding the crossover operation; v) proceeding the mutation operation; and vi) convergence of the algorithm. In this figure, g is the number of generations, g max, the maximum number of generations, FF, the value of fitness function, and FF min, the minimum value of fitness function. The maximum number of generation and minimum value of fitness function are the convergence conditions, and the algorithm will terminate when any one of the convergence conditions is satisfied. 3 Experimental tests of the control strategy developed 3.1 Introduction of the test rig The experimental system applied in the current study is illustrated in Fig. 7 . All the experimental data used in this study were obtained in this test rig. There are two main parts in the test rig: the refrigeration cycle and the conditioned air cycle. The refrigeration cycle is comprised of the compressor, the condenser, the electronic expansion valve and the evaporator. The return air from the air-conditioned room passes through the evaporator and is processed to a proper supply air state, and then is sent back by the fan. The air-conditioned room was 3.8 m in width, 7.6 m in length and 2.8 m in height. In order to simulate the thermal loads of the conditioned room, a moisture and heat load simulator was fixed inside. The ANN or GA controller was digitally implemented when carrying out the control experimental test. All the experimental data obtained can be recorded for control operation and further analysis by using the computerized equipment. The control variables can be obtained by analyzing measured data. Time interval between changes in the control actions was 1 min in the control validation experimental tests. The external view of the test rig is shown in Fig. 8 the control console and programming control terminal are used to realize the control of the air conditioning room and record the experimental data. The main components of the refrigeration cycle of the experimental system are shown in Fig. 9 , including the compressor, electronic expansion valve, evaporator and so on. In order to simulate the thermal loads of the conditioned room, a moisture and heat load simulator (Fig. 10 ) was fixed inside the air conditioning room. The parameters of compressor and fan are given in Tables 1 and 2 . 3.2 Realization procedure of the control strategies The platform used to develop ANN and GA is the MATLAB. The inverse ANN model and the system identification model were developed using the MALAB programming platform. The GA optimization searching procedure is realized using the MATLAB Genetic Algorithm and Direct Search Toolbox. During the process of control, the calculation results of the MATLAB were called by a data logging and control supervisory program. The data logging and control supervisory program is built by the LabVIEW programming platform. The function of this supervisory program is collecting data and performing control. Therefore, the data and control orders were transmitted from the controller to the actual system by the computer supervisory program. The supervisory program has a self-programming module by which different control algorithms could be produced for different conditions. The program operates on a personal computer, which act as the control center. During the process of control, the control settings could be revised and the control procedure could be ended through the computer. 3.3 Results of the experimental tests In order to validate the ANN and GA control strategies developed, 4 groups of experimental tests were carried out. The experimental tests are to examine whether the ANN or GA control strategy could respond to follow the control command of indoor air conditions. The initial settings of indoor air conditions and the control commands in the 4 groups of experimental tests are shown in Table 3 . Figs. 11 and 12 present the results of Test I for the ANN control strategy and GA control strategy. The initial settings of indoor air temperature in Test I were T d = 28 °C and T w = 21 °C, and the settings were changed to T d = 26 °C and T w = 19 °C at 240 s after beginning, and the controller was then operated by changing the control actions. As seen, both the ANN control strategy and the GA control strategy could control the values of T d and T w to reached their command values. At about 1500s, the values of dry bulb and wet bulb temperatures reached their required level and remained stable for the time period afterwards. The control results of the dry bulb temperature were generally better than that of the wet bulb temperature, whether in the ANN control strategy or the GA control strategy. The wet bulb temperature fluctuated relatively more greatly after reaching the control requirements, but still within a certain range of ± 0.3 °C. The results of the Test II, Test III and Test IV are presented in Figs. 13\u201318 . The initial settings were T d = 27 °C and T w = 20 °C in Test II, T d = 26 °C and T w = 19 °C in Test III, and T d = 24 °C and T w = 17 °C in Test IV. The control commands were changed to T d = 25 °C and T w = 18 °C in Test II, T d = 23 °C and T w = 16 °C in Test III, and T d = 25 °C and T w = 18 °C in Test IV, at 240 s into the test. As seen from the experimental results, both the ANN control strategy and the GA control strategy could properly follow the changes in control commands and remain a relatively stable fluctuation during the process of control within the allowable range of ± 0.3 °C. 4 Comparison of the control performances To eliminate interference factors in comparing the control characteristics of the ANN control strategy and the GA control strategy, the system identification model involved in the control strategies were exactly the same. Besides, to eliminate the influence of experimental factors as much as possible, the two experiments for the ANN control strategy and the GA control strategy in the same groups were basically carried out in the same external environments, and the same sampling time interval and control duration are maintained. Totally 4 evaluating indicators were employed in this section to comprehensively compare the control performance of the two control strategies established. These evaluating indicators adopted are convergence speed, discrete characteristic, energy consumption and interference resistance ability. 4.1 Convergence speed The convergence speed could be presented by the convergence time Δt c, which is defined as follows: (11) Δ t c = t c − t s In this equation, t c is the time when a new control command was set and the controller was responded to adjust the system inputs to fit the new demand, and t s, the time when all the controlled variables satisfied the convergence criterion. The convergence criterion was that the controlled variable reached the vicinity of the set value (i.e., ±0.3 °C for the current study) and never deviated from this range subsequently. We use the convergence criterion to judge whether the control demand was satisfied. In comparison of the control performance of the two control strategies developed, the convergence time was used to estimate their convergence rapidity. The smaller this value is, the faster the control process converges and the more effective the controller is. The values of convergence time of the ANN control strategy and GA control strategy in the experiments are presented in Table 4 . As shown in this table, with the exception of an equal value in the Test I, the values of convergence time of the ANN control strategy are always smaller than the GA control strategy. This proves that the ANN control strategy is superior to the GA control strategy in terms of convergence speed. 4.2 Discrete characteristic The discrete characteristic of the experimental results could be represented by a parameter in statistics, that is the standard deviation. The standard deviation is defined as follows: (12) S = ∑ i = 1 n ( y s i − c i ) 2 n In the equation, y s is the system output, c , the control command, and n, the number of points logged after the time t c. The sampling points included in the standard deviation calculation all come from the stable stage of the control process. Therefore, this variable is used to indicate the fluctuation conditions after the control converges. The value of the standard deviation indicates the degree to which the controlled variable deviates from the control target. The smaller the value of standard deviation is, the better the stability of the system after convergence is, and the higher the control accuracy is. The calculated values of standard deviation for the ANN control strategy and GA control strategy in the experiments are shown in Table 5 . It can be seen that the values of the standard deviation of the ANN control strategy and the GA control strategy are not much different in the same group. In most cases, the values of standard deviation of the GA control strategy are smaller, indicating better stability and accuracy after convergence for the GA control strategy. But there are exceptions, for example, in the Test III, the value of S for GA control strategy is 0.15, and that of the ANN control strategy is 0.13. Except for the Test III, the GA control strategy is superior to the ANN control strategy in discrete characteristic. 4.3 Energy consumption The controller adjusts the sensible and latent heat and cooling capacity sent into the room by driving the fan and the compressor to rotate, and the rotation of the fan and the compressor needs to consume a certain amount of energy. Therefore, the energy consumption can be calculated as follows: (13) E = E f + E c In this equation, E f is the energy consumption of the fan and E c, the energy consumption of the compressor. The fan power can be calculated as follows: (14) N f = V f ⋅ P f 3600 η (15) E f = ∑ N f Δ t In these equations, N f is the fan power, V f, the supply air flow rate, P f, the air pressure and η, the efficiency of the fan. The compressor power can be calculated as follows: (16) N c = P s V s k k − 1 [ ( P d P s ) k − 1 k − 1 ] (17) E c = ∑ N c Δ t In these equations, N c is the compressor power, P s, the suction pressure of the compressor, V s, the steam flow rate under suction pressure, k, isentropic index and P d, discharge pressure of the compressor. The values of the energy consumption were calculated and presented in Table 6 . The energy consumption of the ANN control strategy is always smaller than that of the GA control strategy, no matter in terms of fan energy consumption, compressor energy consumption or total energy consumption. We could draw the conclusion that the ANN control strategy is more superior in energy saving characteristic comparing with the GA control strategy base on the current experimental results. 4.4 Interference resistance ability All the experimental tests previously carried out and presented were performed without considering indoor and outdoor interference, however, interference is unavoidable. Whether the influence of interference can be overcome is also an important index to determine the control performance. Therefore, this study used an indoor load simulator to simulate the fluctuations of the indoor load caused by the changes of the outdoor environment, and carried out the control command tracking experimental test under this condition. The results of the interference resistance capacity tests for the ANN control strategy and the GA control strategy are shown in the following Figs. 19 and 20 . As shown in these figures, the outputs from the load simulator were randomly generated within a certain range to simulate the variations of the indoor loads. These two control strategies could control the system to track the control command well, even in the presence of interference, indicating a satisfied capacity of resisting interference. 4.5 Discussions To compare the control performances of the ANN control strategy and the GA control strategy, we conducted the convergence time, discrete characteristic, energy consumption, and interference resistance ability. In terms of convergence time and energy consumption, the ANN control strategy has shown advantages. However, in terms of discrete characteristic, although the difference is not obvious, the GA control strategy performed more prominently in most cases. In terms of interference resistance ability, both control strategies can meet the requirements. The ANN control strategy can make the system converge faster and therefore consume less energy, but it may not be as good as the GA control strategy in stabilizing the equilibrium state of the system. The reason may be that the ANN inverse model, which act as the control actuator in the ANN control strategy, was established based on the dynamic experimental data of the air conditioning system, therefore it is better than the GA control strategy in grasping the dynamic characteristics of the system. Moreover, the initial population of the GA searching program, which act as the control actuator in the GA control strategy, was randomly generated, therefore the control of the dynamic characteristics of the air conditioning system may be worse than that of the ANN control strategy just in a short term after beginning of the control process. The comparison results of discrete characteristic also show that the stability of the system under the GA control strategy after the convergence went better. It should be noted that the setting values of various parameters in the ANN control strategy and the GA control strategy will affect the results of the experimental tests, such as the number of ANN layers or the number of iteration generations of GA. However, there is no unified guideline about these parameter settings. The parameters in the ANN control strategy and the GA control strategy in the current study were obtained by experiments and experiences, and still needs further researches. In addition, based on the limited number of experimental groups and experimental conditions, the comparison of the two control strategies may be not sufficient, and more related works need to be carried out in the future. The objectivity of the evaluation is to provide the comparison of the control performance of two usually used intelligent control strategies. The methodology of control performance evaluation is also explored. We should notice that there are many other factors that affect the performance of an algorithm, such as the number of network layers and the gradient update algorithm, the initialization method, and the genetic variation factor, rather than just the type of algorithm. Nevertheless, there was still no unified guidelines for the parameters setting of the ANN and GA, and we just build the control strategies following the rules we exploring, and controllability of the control strategies have been validated experimentally. The development method and control performance comparison method are worthy of reference in the air conditioning system. The influence of the various parameters in the ANN and GA still needs further studies, and may be our future work. 5 Conclusions and future works In this study, an ANN control strategy and a GA control strategy for the air conditioning system were developed and experimentally validated. The control performance of the GA control strategy and the GA control strategy were evaluated and compared. We could draw the conclusions as follows: (1) The ANN control strategy and the GA control strategy were designed for the air conditioning system. In these control strategies, ANN and GA were both applied as the central control algorithms, which can give full play to the advantages of intelligent control algorithms. The control strategies developed could be online updated and adapted to the changes in control commands and external environments. (2) To validate the ANN control strategy and the GA control strategy developed for the air conditioning system, 4 groups of experimental tests were carried out using an experimental test rig. The initial settings of T d and T w were 28 °C and 21 °C, 27 °C and 20 °C, 26 °C and 19 °C, and 24 °C and 17 °C, respectively. The control commands were 26 °C and 19 °C, 25 °C and 18 °C, 23 °C and 16 °C, and 25 °C and 18 °C, respectively. The experimental results showed that both the ANN control strategy and the GA control strategy could control the air conditioning system to follow the control commands, and remain stable afterwards within the range of ±0.3 °C. (3) The control performances of the ANN control strategy and the GA control strategy were compared in terms of convergence speed, discrete characteristic, energy consumption and interference resistance ability. The results showed that the ANN control strategy performed better in convergence speed and energy consumption, while the GA control strategy performed better in discrete characteristic. Therefore, when choosing the intelligent control methods for the air conditioning system, the following principles should be followed: if there are requirements for control convergence speed or energy conservation, the ANN control strategy should be selected, but if the control stability requirements are higher, the GA control strategy will be a better choice. This study fills the three research gaps as mentioned in the introduction section. The novelty of this study is reflected in the following three aspects. First, in the design of the ANN control strategy, ANN was used as both a control actuator and a system identification tool, and the specialized training method and the general training method were used respectively. And all were updated online in real time according to system changes. Second, the GA control strategy was a combination of GA and ANN. GA acted as a control actuator, while ANN acts as a system identification tool. ANN was updated online in real time, while for GA, the output of the controller at the previous time step was set as the initial population of the optimization searching process at the next time step. Third, this study innovatively employed 4 evaluating indicators including convergence speed, discrete characteristic, energy consumption and interference resistance ability, in the control performance comparison of the ANN control strategy and the GA control strategy. This would be the first attempt in the research field of intelligent control of the air conditioning system. Future works can be carried out in the following aspects. First, due to the limitation of experimental conditions, only 4 groups of validation experiments were carried out in this study. Therefore, more experiments can be carried out in the future to validate the controllable range of the ANN control strategy and the GA control strategy more comprehensively. Second, on the basis of these experimental studies, the control performance under more experimental conditions can be compared, so as to more systematically evaluate the difference between the control performance of the ANN control strategy and the GA control strategy. Third, the control strategies and control performance comparison methodology proposed in this study can also be applied to other different air conditioning systems or other practical applications, and need continuously developed and improved.

        "dc:description": "Air conditioning systems are playing an increasingly important role in our daily life, and the control of air conditioning systems is related to the intelligence of the system, indoor thermal comfort and energy consumption. Therefore, the control of air conditioning systems has always been an important research topic. Artificial neural network (ANN) and genetic algorithm (GA) are two commonly used intelligent control methods. However, there is no guidance until now on the applicability of these two control methods and how to make a choice between them in the control of air conditioning systems. In this study, an ANN control strategy and a GA control strategy were developed and experimentally verified. The experimental results indicated that both the ANN control strategy and the GA control strategy could control the air conditioning system properly under different control commands. To compare the control performances, the convergence speed, discrete characteristic, energy consumption and interference resistance ability were calculated or experimentally validated. The ANN control strategy showed better performances in the convergence speed and energy consumption. While the GA control strategy performed better in maintaining the stable state of the air conditioning system. The innovation of this study lies in two points. First, when designing the ANN control strategy and the GA control strategy, ANN and GA were applied as the central control algorithm, rather than only as auxiliary algorithms for system identification, prediction or optimization. This methodology is relatively novel in the design of ANN and GA control strategies for the air conditioning system, and could further expand the application of ANN and GA. Second, this study employed 4 evaluating indicators including convergence speed, discrete characteristic, energy consumption and interference resistance ability, to comprehensively evaluated the control performance of ANN control strategy and GA control strategy.",
