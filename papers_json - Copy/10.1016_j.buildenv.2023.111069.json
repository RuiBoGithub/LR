Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems account for a significant proportion of the energy consumption of a building. With the global energy demand increasing every year, optimal HVAC control methods that reduce energy consumption while maintaining the thermal comfort of the occupants have become more important. Weather forecasting data have thus attracted significant research attention for the optimization of building energy consumption in model-based studies. However, these HVAC control approaches have failed to consider the reduction in the predictive error of the incorporated weather model, leading to performance limitations. Accordingly, model-free reinforcement learning (RL)-based HVAC systems that can be controlled dynamically have been proposed, and these have exhibited significantly better performance than model-based methods. However, RL algorithms using weather forecasting data have not yet been assessed for use in optimal HVAC control for buildings. In this study, we propose WDQN-temPER, a hybrid HVAC control method combining a deep Q-network with a novel prioritized experience replay (PER) technique (referred to as temPER) and a gated recurrent unit (GRU) model. The GRU model predicts the future outdoor temperature and this is used as a state variable in the RL model. The proposed temPER algorithm facilitates the use of samples in the RL training process with larger changes in the outdoor temperature based on the predicted temperature. We experimentally demonstrate in EnergyPlus simulations that our proposed WDQN-temPER model outperforms a rule-based baseline model in terms of HVAC control, with energy savings of up to 58.79%.

In particular, attention has turned to optimizing the control of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, which generally account for 40\u201350% of a building's energy consumption [1,2]. The International Energy Agency (IEA) has reported that significant energy savings can be achieved via the optimal control of HVAC systems [3]. This means that the system must be operated so that the occupants experience a pleasant thermal environment while also reducing the energy consumption. However, the HVAC control problem is more challenging than other control problems because satisfying the thermal comfort of the occupants and minimizing energy consumption represents a direct trade-off. Model predictive control (MPC) has been widely employed to address this trade-off [4]. MPC uses dynamic models to predict the thermal behavior of a building, and this information is subsequently used to control the HVAC system in a way that reduces energy consumption while maintaining temperature comfort [5]. Although many successful examples of MPC have been reported [6\u20138], the performance of these MPC systems relies heavily on the accuracy of the base model [9,10] and the robustness of the online optimization [11,12]. Due to these concerns, model-free reinforcement learning (RL) methods have recently gained more attention as an alternative to MPC because this approach can dynamically control the building environment [13]. Because RL can be trained on various dynamic environments, RL-based HVAC control can outperform existing MPC and rule-based control (RBC) methods [14]. However, existing model-free HVAC control methods have not yet considered the use of domain-specific algorithms; in other words, they simply apply an existing RL method without considering the characteristics of the data for the building environment at the algorithm level [15]. To address this issue, we propose a domain-specific model that can more effectively adapt to changes in the building environment and can better control HVAC systems. The proposed approach is referred to as WDQN-temPER, which combines a gated recurrent unit (GRU) algorithm [16] and a deep Q-network (DQN) [17] with temPER, a novel prioritized experience replay (PER) [18] algorithm that reflects the changes in the outdoor temperature. Since this study has a small number of actions, designing a DQN model can efficiently search and has the advantage of stability and speed of learning [17]. The main contributions of the present study are as follows: \u2022 We propose a hybrid HVAC control method that combines a GRU algorithm and a DQN to fully utilize uncertain weather forecast information. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported example of preemptive HVAC control that considers weather forecast information in a model-free RL approach. \u2022 To efficiently respond to sudden temperature changes, we propose a new PER algorithm, called temPER, that preferentially learns data with large changes in the outdoor temperature in RL. \u2022 The proposed WDQN-temPER model exhibited a savings of 58.79% compared with the baseline model. The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 summarizes existing HVAC control studies and approaches to weather forecasting for HVAC control. Section 3 describes the methodology employed in this study, while Section 4 discusses the simulation results for the proposed WDQN-temPER model. Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper and suggests future research directions. 2 Related work 2.1 Weather forecasting Traditional weather forecasting has generally been conducted using numerical weather prediction models based on traditional machine learning [19,20]. For example, various studies have predicted the weather using support vector machine, random forest, and support vector regression algorithms [21\u201323]. In addition, Karevan et al. [24] proposed a transductive feature selection method for temperature prediction using clustering-based entropy sampling that considered seasonal weather variables. However, because ML-based models contain shallow layers, their prediction performance is limited compared with deep learning methods, which employ deep layers to capture hidden nonlinear relationships between uncertain weather variables [25]. Because of the advantages of deep learning, it has been adopted in recent research on weather forecasting tasks. For example, Salman et al. [26] compared the performance of recurrent neural network (RNN), conditional restricted Boltzmann machine, and convolutional neural network models in rainfall forecasting and reported that the RNN model achieved the strongest forecasting performance. Recently, Suleman et al. [27] proposed a spatial feature attention long short-term memory (SFA-LSTM) model, which has an encoder\u2013decoder architecture that captures the spatial and temporal relationships among multiple meteorological features to forecast the weather. They achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) prediction accuracy in weather forecasting tasks. In addition to various studies related to weather forecasting, other research has employed weather forecasting data for use in building control, showing that it can be used to resolve problems associated with the optimizations of building energy consumption. For example, Dong et al. [28] proposed an HVAC MPC model using local weather forecasting information to predict the behavior patterns of the building occupants. Their method achieved energy savings of 17.8% during summer and 30.1% during winter compared with conventional RBC. Khan et al. [29] also proposed a rule-based HVAC control methodology using weather forecasting information that generated energy savings of 30%. Therefore, based on the results of these recent studies that have demonstrated the utility of weather forecasting information in improving the energy efficiency of HVAC control, the present study proposes a model that can maximize the use of weather forecasting information as determined via experiments. 2.2 RL methodology for HVAC system control RL can be classified into model-free and model-based methods. Within model-based RL, there are two subcategories: those that learn a model, such as World Models [30] and I2A [31], and those with a given model, as seen in AlphaZero [32]. Some studies have applied model-based RL to optimize HVAC system control. For example, Zhang et al. [33] proposed a model-based RL approach to learn system dynamics using neural networks. They achieved a reduction in energy consumption ranging from 17.1% to 21.8% compared with the model-free proximal policy optimization (PPO) RL approach. Chen et al. [34] introduced a method called MBRL_MC for HVAC systems by combining MPC and model-based RL, which successfully avoided complex errors during training and improved learning stability. Furthermore, Chen et al. [35] verified the effectiveness of meta-learning through model-based offline RL to model the thermal preferences of various occupants. However, model-based RL is less general because it requires many additional data sets and labor-intensive modeling [36]. Model-free deep RL (DRL) has demonstrated outstanding efficiency in HVAC systems. In particular, research based on DQN-based models has been actively conducted. Ahn et al. [37] applied a DQN for optimal balanced control of different HVAC systems. This decreased the indoor CO2 concentration by 1000 ppm while reducing the total energy consumption by 15.7%. In addition, to efficiently control multivariate occupant-centered buildings, Lei et al. [38] presented a framework using an agent based on a branching dueling Q-network (BDQ), an advanced variant of a DQN. Considering individual thermal comfort and occupancy, cooling energy was reduced by 14% and heat acceptance was improved by 11%. Furthermore, Xiangtian et al. [39] developed a non-stationary DQN that integrated a DQN and the active detection of changes in the building environment to control an HVAC system. They produced an energy-saving effect of 13%, while the thermal comfort effect improved by 9%. In addition to DQNs, previous research has also investigated other model-free RL methods for use in HVAC control. For example, Du et al. [40] adopted the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) for the energy optimization of multi-zone residential HVAC control, while Zhong et al. [41] used the A3C method and achieved energy savings of 12.8% compared with existing control methods without reducing thermal comfort. Additionally, Abrazeh et al. [42] developed a real-time digital twin that separately controls the indoor humidity and indoor temperature of a PPO-based backstepping controller, while Fang et al. [43] proposed a DRL control strategy for the real-time resetting of temperature setpoints in multi-zone building HVAC systems. Fang et al. [44] also proposed a transfer learning and DRL (TL-DRL) integrated framework to achieve DRL control strategy transfer at the building HVAC system level to increase the energy efficiency. Unlike studies that have employed DQN models, these studies have adopted more advanced DRL approaches to perform tasks that include complex control or advanced building environments. In this study, due to the small set of actions in our environment, we employ a DQN-based approach. This is because the smaller the number of actions, the higher the search efficiency of the DQN model, while the stability and learning performance also improve [19]. In addition, in previous studies that have attempted HVAC control using RL, the proposed methods had limitations because they simply employ RL without domain-specific algorithms. Therefore, we incorporate weather prediction information into an RL model and propose temPER, which allows RL to effectively learn transition samples with rapid temperature changes. 3 Methodology The framework for the methodology of the present study is presented in Fig. 1 . The framework consists of four steps: (1) weather forecasting model comparison and selection, (2) establishment of the building simulation environment, (3) algorithm design and development, and (4) algorithm evaluation. \u2022 The first step determines the optimal weather forecasting model. We compare four weather forecasting models and select the one with the lowest error. \u2022 The second step establishes the building simulation environment. The baseline building is modeled using EnergyPlus. \u2022 The third step develops the full WDQN-temPER model to control the building's HVAC system based on the weather forecasting algorithm. \u2022 The final step evaluates the proposed model. We compare the performance of three models (the baseline, DQN, and proposed WDQN-temPER models) and analyze the results of a case study. 3.1 Weather forecasting modeling For the weather forecasting model, five attributes are used as input and the output is the predicted temperature 1 h ahead. Table 1 summarizes the input attributes used in the weather model testing. These variables have been shown in previous studies to have a strong effect on weather prediction results [45\u201348]. Because the weather forecasting model is designed to predict the temperature 1 h ahead based on the previous steps, it has a time series-based structure. Because it is important to employ a weather forecast model with a low prediction error for use in HVAC control, we compare the following four time-series models and select the option with the lowest forecasting error: \u2022 LSTM [49]: A gate-mechanism-based RNN model proposed to resolve the long-term dependency, vanishing gradient, and expanding problems associated with traditional RNNs. It consists of an input gate, a forget gate, and an output gate. \u2022 GRU [16]: Proposed by Cho et al. to reduce computational costs while functioning in a similar manner to LSTM with fewer gates. \u2022 FiLM [50]: FiLM extracts features from series inputs of various lengths and uses legendre memory units to express time series data and preserve historical information. A combination of Fourier analysis and low-rank matrix approximation reduces the impact of noise on the time series to achieve SOTA performance. \u2022 SFA-LSTM [26]: A LSTM-based methodology that uses a spatial attachment module to capture current spatial and temporary relationships among multiple metrical features to forecast temperature. It consists of an encoder and a decoder and has achieved SOTA prediction performance in temperature forecasting tasks. The mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) are used as indicators to evaluate the performance of the weather forecasting models. The MSE, MAE, and MAPE are defined in Equations (1)\u2013(3), respectively: (1) M S E = ∑ 1 N ( y i − y ˆ i ) 2 N (2) M A E = ∑ 1 N | y i − y ˆ i | N (3) M A P E = 100 N ∑ 1 N | y i − y ˆ i y i | , where y i is the actual outdoor temperature at time step i , y ˆ i is the predicted outdoor temperature at time step i , and N is the sample size. Table 2 presents the prediction performance for the tested weather forecasting models. These models are trained and developed with an input sequence of 48, 60, or 72 h and an output sequence of 1 h. Overall, the prediction results show that the GRU model predicts temperatures relatively accurately both in summer and in winter, and its performance is optimal with a window size of 48 h. In particular, the GRU model has a lower error than the other three models for a sequence length of 48 h with all three evaluation metrics. Also, the MSE is slightly lower than all of others at sequence lengths of 60 and 72 h. In winter, when the sequence length is 48 and 60 h, the GRU model has the lowest MSE, MAE, and MAPE results. Based on these results, we select the GRU model as the weather forecasting algorithm for our proposed approach (see Table 3). 3.2 Establishment of the simulation environment In this study, EnergyPlus is used to build the building simulation environment. EnergyPlus is widely used in building energy analytics globally [51] and has often been used to simulate the performance of HVAC components and systems. In this study, the simulation environment is established in EnergyPlus based on information for the weather, building, and HVAC equipment. This simulation environment is subsequently used in algorithm training, testing, and evaluation. 3.3 Algorithm design and development 3.3.1 Deep Q-network DQN is an RL method that combines Q-learning [52] and a deep neural network (DNN) [53]. Q-learning is a value-based off-policy method that takes an action with the maximum Q-value, Q ( s t , a t ) , as evaluated using an action-value function (Q-function) rather than directly learning the policy. The state s t ∈ S , where S is the set of all possible states, becomes the input for the RL model and the Q-value becomes the observed value at time step t in the environment. Action a t ∈ A , where A is the set of all possible actions, indicates the action taken by the agent from state s t at time step t . State transition P ( s t + 1 | s t , a t ) from the Markov reward process (MDP) satisfies the following Markov assumption: (4) P ( s t + 1 | s t , a t ) = P ( s t + 1 | s t , a t , s t − 1 , \u2026 , s 1 , a 1 ) . The reward value returned from the environment when the agent selects action a t from state s t at time t is referred to as reward r t . Ultimately, the goal of RL is to maximize the discounted accumulative future reward R t = ∑ k = 1 ∞ γ k − 1 r t + k (e.g., the energy consumption while maintaining the indoor temperature). Here, γ ∈ [ 0,1 ] is the discount factor, which is the discount rate multiplied at each step. Q-learning updates the Q-value Q ( s t , a t ) while the agent interacts with the environment to experience transition ( s t , a t , r t , s t + 1 ) , consisting of state s t , action a t , reward r t at time step t and state s t + 1 at time step t+1. Q-learning is based on the following Bellman equation [54]: (5) Q t ( s t , a t ) = r t + γ max a Q t ( s t + 1 , a ) . The DQN computes these Q-values using a DNN, which is referred to as a Q-network. The input for the DQN is the state and the output is the Q-values of all actions. Accordingly, the number of neurons in the output layer of the Q-network equals the number of actions. The parameters for the DQN are trained so that the discounted accumulated reward is maximized. 3. 3. 2 Prioritized experience replay The DQN method uses a replay memory (also known as a replay buffer) that saves the transitions that are taken while the model experiences the transitions. From replay memory M of a conventional DQN, randomly selected transitions are utilized to train the Q-network via mini-batch sampling. However, this sampling method does not consider the importance of each transition. Considering the importance of each transition is important for RL models in terms of efficiency. In a conventional DQN that is randomly sampled, more computation is required because all transitions are played at the same frequency, and non-critical transitions are also played back, which reduces the efficiency. To solve this problem, the PER algorithm has been proposed to prioritize beneficial transitions and preferentially learn high-priority transitions. The TD-error is used to determine which transition is important for learning, and the conventional TD-error T D i o r i is calculated as [18] (6) T D i o r i = r t + γ max a t Q ( s t + 1 , a t ) − Q ( s t , a t ) , where i is the index of the transition stored in the replay buffer. The probability that the i-th transition is sampled is p i = | T D i o r i | + b , where b is a constant with a very small value so that the selection probability of the i-th transition does not become 0. Using the derived p i , the probability of sampling the i-th transition is calculated as (7) P ( i ) = p i α / ∑ c p c α , where α is the degree to which the prioritization rank is reflected. Transitions with a higher prioritization have a higher probability of being learned. 3.3.3 DQN-based control model In using RL for the optimal control of a building's HVAC system, the control problem needs to first be defined as an MDP. A schematic diagram of a DQN-based control model for an HVAC system is presented in Fig. 2 . In this setup, the building HVAC system is regarded as the environment, and the strategy for controlling the HVAC system is regarded as the agent. The design of the environment state, control action, and reward function are described below. \u2022 Environment state The state variables used in this study are presented in Table 4 . In the DQN, the state consists of six attributes, including the predicted future temperature from the GRU-based weather algorithm. The attributes are divided into RL environment and environment attributes. Environment attributes cannot be controlled by the DQN, while RL environment attributes are affected and adjusted when the agent selects an action. \u2022 Reward function The purpose of this study is to minimize HVAC energy consumption while maintaining a comfortable indoor temperature. A comfortable indoor temperature is defined as maintaining the indoor temperature between the maximum T i n , t max and minimum T i n , t min of the zonal mean air temperature T i n , t at time t. To achieve this goal, we define the reward function r t as follows: (8) r t = − β ( max ( T i n , t − T i n , t max , 0 ) + max ( T i n , t min − T i n , t , 0 ) ) − E t , where E t is the energy consumption at time t, and β is a scaling parameter that is used to adjust the temperature penalty and energy consumption ratio. Because minimizing the energy is one of the primary goals, we set the energy consumption as a penalty in the reward function as in previous studies [12\u201314]. The penalty is incurred in accordance with the extent to which the indoor temperature falls outside the comfortable indoor temperature range. The reward is thus lower as the energy consumption increases and as the temperature moves away from the comfortable indoor temperature range [ T i n , t min , T i n , t max ]. \u2022 Control action In the present study, the HVAC is controlled by turning the heat pump on or off and via indoor cooling/heating set temperatures. However, the cooling/heating set temperature has no purpose when the heat pump is off, so the temperature setting is considered only when the heat pump is turned on. We also reduce the action space by setting the target temperatures separately for the summer and winter seasons. The full range of actions employed in this study is presented in Table 4. 3.4 Proposed method 3.4.1 WDQN-temPER In the present study, we propose WDQN-temPER a hybrid RL framework that uses weather forecasting information and combines a GRU algorithm and a DQN for real-world HVAC control in buildings. The proposed WDQN-temPER framework is outlined in Fig. 3 . The training and evaluation of our proposed HVAC control strategy are conducted in a single-building environment using EnergyPlus. Our model is divided into two parts: a GRU weather forecasting algorithm that predicts the 1-h-ahead outdoor temperature and a DQN that utilizes this predicted temperature as a state variable. The weather forecasting model and the DQN are not trained at the same time; rather, the weather forecasting model is trained first, and only the output of the pre-trained weather forecast model is employed as a state variable in the DQN. 3.4.2 WDQN-temPER training phase for HVAC control The WDQN-temPER training phase is summarized as Algorithm 1. Before training, the Q network and the environment are randomly initialized with a memory buffer for the storing of experiences. The agent interacts with the building environment, receives the state as input, and decides which action to select at each time t. The state consists of a combination of the 1-h-ahead outdoor temperature from the pre-trained weather forecasting model and attributes from the building environment. The transition ( s t , a t , r t , s t + 1 ) calculates the priority reflecting the TD-error and stores it in replay memory M. When calculating this priority, the novel temPER algorithm is used, and the resulting TD-error T D i w t is employed to determine the rank by reflecting the change in the forecasted weather temperature W F d f = ( T o u t , t − T ˆ o u t , t + 1 ) 2 , where T o u t , t and T o u t , t + 1 refer to the outdoor temperature at time t and the predicted outdoor temperature at t + 1 . Compared with the conventional PER algorithm, the RL learning efficiency is improved when using the weather forecasting information with a lower prediction error because the priority is increased for transitions with large temperature differences. We define T D i w t as follows: (9) T D i w t = W F d f ( r t + γ max a t Q ( s t + 1 , a t ) − Q ( s t , a t ) ) . The probability that the i-th transition is sampled is expressed as p i = | T D i w t | + b , where b is a constant with a small value so that the selection probability for the i-th transition does not become 0. Using the derived p i , the probability of sampling the i-th transition from sample c is calculated as follows: (10) P ( i ) = p i α / ∑ c p c α , where α is the degree to which the prioritization rank is reflected. The weight change Δ is then updated as Δ ← Δ + T D i w t ∙ π j ∙ ∇ w Q ( s j − 1 , a j − 1 ) , where π j is an important weight with the gradient ∇ w Q ( s j − 1 , a j − 1 ) . We do this for each i . When this process is complete, to update the parameters of the weights, θ ← θ + φ ∙ Δ is run. Based on these updates, our RL model replays more highly prioritized experiences. During the training phase, the agent learns how to control the HVAC system, updates the action-value function, and accumulates rewards related to other state\u2013action pairs. As Q t ( a ) converges to the optimal value Q * ( a ) over several episodes, the agent determines the optimal policy and utilizes the updated policy. In this training process, epsilon-greedy strategy expansion is employed to select an action, which involves choosing an action with a random probability by the ratio of ε. At the end of every episode, the epsilon value decays because the Q-value is not enough at the beginning of learning, so the value gradually accumulates to search for the optimal value for the behavior. For this reason, most of the action selections in the early stages of the learning process are made randomly. ε has a value between 0 and 1 and is calculated using Equation (11): (11) ε = ε 0 ∙ μ e p i s o d e , where ε 0 is the ε of the first episode and μ is the epsilon decay factor. ε gradually decreases with epsilon decay μ < 1 as time progresses. The weight parameter w of the Q -network is updated through the mini-batch sampling of the transition tuple ( s t , a t , r t , s t + 1 ) stored in memory M, where ( s t , a t , r t , s t + 1 ) are samples obtained by action a t selected through the Q -value ρ t , which is calculated according to Equation (12): (12) ρ t = r t + β max a t Q t ( s t + 1 , a t ; w ) , where w is a policy parameter. Q-network updates w in the direction of minimizing loss function ( ρ t − Q t ( s t + 1 , a t ; w ) ) 2 through the obtained ρ t , and w is also updated as in Equation (13) using the gradient descent method: (13) w = w − φ ∂ L o s s ∂ w . Algorithm 1 WDQN-temPER training algorithm Image 1 4 Case study 4.1 Simulated building environment The baseline model used in the present study is a building energy simulation model, a variant of the standard US Department of Energy commercial reference building dataset [55]. The small office model has a total floor area of 5500 ft2 (90.8 ft × 60.5 ft; Fig. 4 ). The floor-to-floor height is 10 ft, and the external façade has a window-to-wall ratio of 0.24 (Table 5 ). The indoor air temperature is set to 24 °C for cooling and 21 °C for heating. The setback temperature was set at 29.4 °C for cooling and 15.55 °C for heating. Information on the typical construction materials and other design data for the HVAC system in the small office is listed in Table 6 [56]. 4.2 Hyperparameter setting for training The building information is set for the observation and control of the heat pump in one zone of the environmental symbiosis building, with a time step of 10 min. We train using EPW data [57] containing weather information for Seoul, the Republic of Korea. The training period is from June 1 to August 31 in summer and from December 1 to February 28 in winter. The tested models are trained for a total of 20 episodes over these periods. The test is conducted using weather information data for Osan [58], the Republic of Korea, which has a weather environment similar to that of Seoul. The test period is from June 1 to August 31 in summer and from December 1 to February 28 in winter. The EPW file contains more than 30 types of weather-related information such as the external temperature and external relative humidity. The specific data in the file are described as attributes of the weather forecasting model in Table 1. In the EPW file, one time step is set as 1 h, so one time step in the EPW file corresponds to six steps in the IDF file. The hyperparameters used for model training are summarized in Table 7 . 4.3 Analysis of the results 4.3.1 Energy consumption and efficiency The performance of the proposed WDQN-temPER model is compared with the baseline model in terms of its energy efficiency. The results of the two models for winter and summer are presented in Table 8 . Our proposed model has the lowest energy consumption in both summer and winter, with energy savings of 48.86% in June, 50.72% in July, and 56.76% in August compared with the baseline. In addition, compared with the DQN model, the proposed model reduces energy use by 6.73% in June, 4.60% in July, and 9.72% in August. In winter, the energy efficiency of the proposed model is slightly lower than during summer, but it still outperforms the baseline model (99.96% in December, 99.96% in January, and 61.75% in February) and the DQN model (1.50%, 2.80%, and 4.57%, respectively). Overall, the summer and winter energy savings derived from the WDQN-temPER model are 58.79% and 4.40%, respectively, compared with the baseline and DQN models, respectively. 4.3.2 Maintaining the indoor temperature The proposed model is evaluated by comparing its performance with that of the baseline and DQN models in terms of maintaining the indoor temperature. For this test, the target indoor temperature is set at 24\u201326 °C in summer and 20\u201322 °C in winter. To assess the performance of the models, the number of 10-min control cycles in which the indoor temperature exceeds the specified temperature range is counted, and the sum of the excess temperature is also recorded (Fig. 6). In the summer, the number of times the WDQN-temPER model exceeded the set indoor temperature range is significantly lower than that of the baseline model and slightly higher than that of the DQN model. However, the WDQN-temPER model has the lowest accumulated excess temperature, indicating that the degree to which it exceeds the target indoor temperature range is lower than that of the other two models. In winter, all three models have a similar number of out-of-range cases, but the accumulated excess temperature is again lower for the WDQN-temPER model. Therefore, the WDQN-temPER model outperforms the other models in terms of maintaining the indoor temperature. In addition, Fig. 7 shows that the indoor temperature is relatively stable within the set temperature range using the WDQN-temPER model despite the large variation in the outdoor temperature during the test period. 4.3.3 Indoor temperature profiles and corresponding energy consu mptions using temperature setpoint control strategy According to the setpoint settings, Fig. 8 shows the trends in energy consumption and indoor temperature maintenance for the proposed WDQN-temPER model, the baseline model, and the DQN model. In the case of the baseline model, the thermostat temperature was scheduled with setpoint times from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., with setbacks during other times, including weekends. Specifically, the setpoint temperature was set at 24 °C for summer and 21 °C for winter, while the setback temperatures were set at 29.4 °C for summer and 15.5 °C for winter. Conversely, the DQN and WDQN-temPER models had setpoints of 24\u201326 °C for summer and 20\u201322 °C for winter. In the setpoint temperature graph in Fig. 5 , the baseline model exhibited a substantial range of temperature fluctuations between setpoints and setbacks, resulting in significant differences in indoor temperature and energy consumption. As a result, energy consumption is up to 1.3E8J in summer and 2.0E8J in winter, indicating considerable fluctuation. In contrast, both the DQN model and the WDQN-temPER model maintained relatively stable indoor temperatures, with fluctuations within the range of 24\u201326 °C in summer and 20\u201322 °C in winter. In addition, energy consumption exhibited narrower fluctuations, reaching up to 0.6E8J in summer and 1.2E8J in winter for the DQN model, and up to 0.3E8J in summer and 1.2E8J in winter for the WDQN-temPER model. These values represent a significant reduction in fluctuation compared to the baseline model. As a result, among the three models, the WDQN-temPER model is the best in terms of energy consumption, satisfying the comfortable temperature range in both summer and winter. 4.3.4 Comparison with reinforcement learning models In order to evaluate the superiority of our proposed model, we conduct comparisons with existing model-free RL models, specifically BDQ, DDPG, and A3C, which are representative models capable of discrete actions. The experimental results are presented in Table 9 . First, with regard to energy savings, the WDQN-temPER model outperforms the other models. In addition, in terms of temperature maintenance, the proposed model has the fewest violations of the target temperature range, while the total amount of violations is also the lowest. This means that our model efficiently maintains the temperature while saving energy. Therefore, the effectiveness of our proposed RL methodology for HVAC system control is verified in this comparison with existing RL algorithms. 4.3.5 Analysis of the effectiveness of the weather prediction model We experimentally determine whether combining the RL model with our proposed weather prediction model improves the control performance. To do this, we design a WDQN model that combines the DQN model with a weather prediction model that does not employ the temPER algorithm, and we then compare the WDQN with a basic DQN model that does not incorporate the weather model. The experimental results are presented in Table 10 . The WDQN increases the energy-saving efficiency by 1.66% and 1.77% compared with the DQN in summer and winter, respectively. In addition, when considering both the summer and winter periods, the number of violations of the target temperature range decreases by 104. This demonstrates the advantages of the RL model having access to outdoor temperature prediction results, highlighting its ability to proactively adjust the HVAC system based on these predictions. 4.3.6 Convergence comparison and evaluation In order to confirm that our model has a stable training process, we evaluated the learning rate for the top three learning runs from a total of 10 learning runs. The learning curves for summer and winter are presented in Fig. 9 . In summer, the proposed WDQN-temPER model exhibits better rewards from the beginning of the training period than the DQN model. In addition, over the 20 learning episodes, it produces better rewards from start to finish. It also learns more efficiently than the DQN model in winter, although the difference is smaller than in summer. Therefore, in both summer and winter, the WDQN-temPER model produces better results and exhibits more stable learning convergence, highlighting its advantages for HVAC control with RL. 5 Conclusion In this study, a novel HVAC control method combining the active detection of changes in a building environment and a DQN is proposed to minimize HVAC energy consumption while maintaining a comfortable indoor temperature. The proposed approach produced good results in terms of temperature control based on the short-term future predictions from the weather forecasting model. In addition, by applying the temPER algorithm, the training process for the model converges quickly and the temperature maintenance and energy efficiency improve. The proposed method can be easily applied not only to DQNs but also to other RL methodologies with replay buffers. Therefore, this method proposed for HVAC control using RL offers insights into RL research as a whole. We confirmed that the proposed model performs well in controlling building energy consumption. However, our study was the result of the simulation of a single-zone building, which may not reflect the reality of various buildings and environments. Therefore, our model requires testing in complex situations, including for multi-zone buildings. Future studies are thus planned to devise feasible ways to consider the use of various building types/sizes, HVAC systems types, and different climate conditions. In particular, we will examine the errors that occur when applying the proposed method to real-world building environments and to simulation environments that can be easily set up by input or calculation. Additionally, we will consider occupancy time for more precise testing. We also will test scenarios involving large and complex HVAC systems to further improve the learning efficiency of the model. Finally, we aim to verify the proposed method using empirical analysis. The overall goal is to improve HVAC control using the new model to more consistently achieve a comfortable indoor temperature and reduce energy consumption.

        "dc:description": "Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems account for a significant proportion of the energy consumption of a building. With the global energy demand increasing every year, optimal HVAC control methods that reduce energy consumption while maintaining the thermal comfort of the occupants have become more important. Weather forecasting data have thus attracted significant research attention for the optimization of building energy consumption in model-based studies. However, these HVAC control approaches have failed to consider the reduction in the predictive error of the incorporated weather model, leading to performance limitations. Accordingly, model-free reinforcement learning (RL)-based HVAC systems that can be controlled dynamically have been proposed, and these have exhibited significantly better performance than model-based methods. However, RL algorithms using weather forecasting data have not yet been assessed for use in optimal HVAC control for buildings. In this study, we propose WDQN-temPER, a hybrid HVAC control method combining a deep Q-network with a novel prioritized experience replay (PER) technique (referred to as temPER) and a gated recurrent unit (GRU) model. The GRU model predicts the future outdoor temperature and this is used as a state variable in the RL model. The proposed temPER algorithm facilitates the use of samples in the RL training process with larger changes in the outdoor temperature based on the predicted temperature. We experimentally demonstrate in EnergyPlus simulations that our proposed WDQN-temPER model outperforms a rule-based baseline model in terms of HVAC control, with energy savings of up to 58.79%.",
