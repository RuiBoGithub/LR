Model predictive control (MPC) for building energy management has exhibited a huge potential for largely cutting down energy use and improving human comfort. However, the high demand for computational power for solving the optimization is challenging the widespread deployment of MPC in real buildings. Typical MPC employs a time-triggered mechanism (TTM) that runs optimization recurrently at each time step without considering the necessity, which could cause excessive computation resource usage. This paper proposes an event-triggered mechanism (ETM) that only runs optimization when triggering events occur. Contrary to conventional ETMs that only considers the current information (e.g., room conditions), the ETM proposed is based on a cost function that covers the past, current, and future information. Based on the proposed ETM, a machine-learning-based event-triggered model predictive control (ETMPC) system that optimizes both building energy efficiency and thermal comfort is developed. The developed ETMPC system is then employed for air-conditioning control for performance evaluation through simulations. The control performance of the proposed ETMPC is compared to an MPC employing TTM and a common thermostat. Compared to the MPC employing TTM, the proposed ETMPC reduced the computational load in terms of the number of optimization runs by 77.6%\u201388.2%, meanwhile, achieving similar energy savings (more than 9.3% energy saving over the thermostat) as the MPC employing TTM does (9% energy saving over the thermostat). With the significant reduction of computational load, the ETMPC achieves similar thermal comfort performance as the MPC employing TTM does, and it is significantly better over the thermostat.

As a major energy user, the building sector exhibits a huge potential for cost-efficiently improving energy efficiency and reducing carbon emissions worldwide [1]. Indeed, buildings are responsible for up to 40% of global final energy use [2], harbouring a large potential for energy savings. Globally, around half of building energy is used by heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems during the operation stage [3]. In tropical regions (e.g., Singapore), air-conditioning and mechanical ventilation (ACMV) systems are responsible for more than half of building energy use [4,5]. Hence, the optimization of HVAC/ACMV operations through smart control techniques has been widely studied as a key effort for energy efficiency improvement in buildings in the past decades [6]. Among these previous studies, model predictive control (MPC) has been considered one of the most promising smart control techniques for achieving substantial building energy savings and improving occupants\u2019 wellbeing [7,8]. At each control interval, MPC exploits a building model and forecasted/measured disturbance information (e.g., internal heat gains and weather) to predict the future building responses (e.g., thermal comfort and indoor air temperature) across a prediction horizon. Subsequently, MPC searches for optimal future control strategies (e.g., the optimal cooling power of air-conditioning) considering the predicted future building responses. Hence, MPC controls HAVC/ACMV systems in a proactive and predictive manner instead of reactive-based control strategies (e.g., on/off and proportional\u2013integral\u2013derivative (PID)) found in most current building energy management (BEM) systems, to optimize building energy efficiency and human comfort. The building model is a vital component of MPC for BEM applications. Two building modelling approaches, i.e., physics-based as well as machine learning (ML) \u2013 based approaches, are usually employed in developing MPC for BEM applications [9,10]. The physics-based building modelling approach employs the laws of conservation of energy and mass to explicitly model the heat/mass transfer processes in building thermal mass (e.g., indoor air, walls, roofs, floors, and windows), building energy systems (e.g., cooling, ventilation, and lighting), and their interactions with outside environments [11]. With the explicit description of the heat/mass transfer processes, physics-based building models could be understandable to users and reliable for predicting building responses [12]. Hence, MPC with physics-based building models (\u2018physics-based MPC\u2019) for BEM applications has been employed in many previous studies [13]. The main limitation of physics-based building models is the high time/manpower costs and expertise involved in the modelling process [14]. The ML-based building modelling approach is a data-driven approach, which uses ML models for approximating the building dynamics using the operation data of the building. Hence, in contrast to the physics-based approach, the ML-based building modelling approach requires much less expertise in building physics and the time/manpower for model development [15]. With increasing access to building operation data enabled by the growing digitalization of buildings e.g., Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, MPC with ML-based building models (\u2018ML-based MPC\u2019) for buildings has been gaining popularity [16,17]. Another key technological barrier preventing the widespread deployment of MPC for BEM applications is the high computing load for solving the optimization problem involved, which adds a considerable cost to MPC than the conventional reactive-based control [14]. One key reason causing the high computational power demand of MPC is the high complexity (e.g., nonlinearity and high model order) in building models. Methods are derived to simplify building models through developing building models in linearity [18,19], online-linearized building models [20], and model order reduction [21]. However, certain building model complexity (e.g., a room represented by one node) is still required to retain in order to capture building dynamics for individual rooms. Hence, building model complexity will increase with building scale (e.g., number of rooms). To further reduce the high computational power demand of MPC, aspects other than the building model (e.g., the mechanism for solving the optimization problem) also require attention. The receding horizon principle that runs MPC optimization recurrently for updating the optimal control commands at each control interval without considering the necessity [22], is another key reason for the high computational demand of MPC. This time-triggered mechanism (TTM) adopted by MPC can cause excessive optimization runs that consume computational power unnecessarily. A few recent studies employed the concept of event-triggered mechanism (ETM) for building control. ETM only runs optimization when it is necessary, i.e., triggering events occur. The triggering event is usually based on the transition (change over time) of building states (e.g., when the indoor conditions cross certain pre-defined thresholds or the extent of change in indoor conditions over a time step is beyond certain pre-defined thresholds), which implies that the control performance might degrade, and a new optimization run for maintaining control performance is required. The majority of the previous studies adopted ETM by incorporating it into the Markov Decision Process (MDP), establishing the \u2018event-policy-action\u2019 framework, i.e., to obtain the optimal control policy that maps the action space (a set of control actions) with the event space (a set of events), for building control [23]. The \u2018event-policy-action\u2019 structure with ETM can largely cut down the frequency of control actions, hence, reducing computational and communication loads as compared to the conventional \u2018state-policy-action\u2019 structure with TTM for MDPs. Sun et al. [24] developed an event-triggered HVAC control approach, which employs Q-learning to obtain the optimal control policy. The events of their approach to trigger HVAC control actions are the transitions of states, i.e., indoor air temperature, humidity, and CO2 concentration, crossing certain pre-defined thresholds. Their simulations show that the event-triggered control approach reduced 70% of computation time as compared to a conventional time-triggered control approach. A few other studies developed different variants of the event-triggered HVAC control approach. Wu et al. [25] employed a gradient-based algorithm to obtain the optimal control policy based on the transition of room air temperature and the approach achieved acceptable computation time and memory usage for a large-scale HVAC control problem in their simulations. Jia et al. [26] employed a complexity-based approach to obtain the optimal control policy based on the transition of room air temperature. The approach was demonstrated computationally efficient for a large-scale HVAC control problem in their simulations. Wang et al. [23] obtained the optimal control policy based on the transitions of room air temperature and part-load ratio. Their even-triggered approach reduced 60% of computation time as compared to a conventional time-triggered approach. Hosseinloo et al. [27] proposed an event-triggered reinforcement learning strategy to obtain the optimal control policy based on the transition of indoor air temperature. Their simulations show that the proposed approach achieved better efficiency in learning the optimal control policy and reduced the learning time as compared to a conventional time-triggered approach. Besides being incorporated into MDP, ETM has also been incorporated into optimization techniques for building control. Xu et al. [28] developed an event-triggered HVAC control strategy, in which the triggering of mixed-integer programming (MIP)-based optimization of HVAC operation is based on the transition of the indoor predicted mean vote (PMV). Their event-triggered control approach reduced 60% of computation time as compared to a conventional time-triggered approach. These previous studies suggested that ETM can largely cut down the computational load as compared to conventional TTM for building control. Therefore, incorporating ETM to replace the conventional TTM is a possible solution for MPC to largely reduce the computational demand. However, a study investigating this idea is lacking in the literature. A key challenge of incorporating the ETM, as in Refs. [23\u201327], to MPC is that the triggering events in those previous studies merely considered the transitions of the building states (e.g., indoor air temperature and humidity) at the current time, while the building states at the past and future times that also affect building performance were not included. Due to the dynamics of building states, events that are only based on the building states at the current time could either lead to delays in triggering or over-triggering of needless optimization runs [29], causing unsatisfactory future building states (e.g., uncomfortable indoor air conditions) or unnecessary use of computational resources. For instance, room conditions could be desirable at the current time step, but they might be going to become undesirable in a couple of time steps down the prediction horizon. If the prediction and optimization runs are only triggered when the room conditions have already become undesirable, it diminishes the advantage of the predictive control capability that comes with MPC. Addressing this research gap, this study aims at applying ETM to MPC to largely cut down the computational load to mitigate the computational bottleneck in the widespread deployment of MPC for BEM applications. The study proposed a machine-learning-based event-triggered model predictive control (ETMPC) for simultaneously optimizing energy efficiency and occupants\u2019 wellbeing in buildings. The ETMPC replaces the conventional TTM with the ETM, therefore, the ETMPC solves the computation-costly optimization problem only when it is needed. As the key feature of the proposed ETMPC, the proposed ETM considers the transition of the MPC cost function that captures the past, current, and future building states within a prediction horizon to better capture building dynamics as compared to conventional ETMs that only consider the current states in triggering events. The ETMPC employs a machine-learning-based building model trained using historical building operation data. A case study of the proposed ETMPC for ACMV control of a test building was implemented in a simulation environment. A series of simulation cases were conducted in the case study for the feasibility and effectiveness evaluation of the proposed ML-based ETMPC with comparison to a regular MPC employing TTM and a conventional reactive-based thermostat as a baseline. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the methodologies used in this study, including the proposed event-triggered model predictive control, event-trigger mechanism, and machine-learning-based building modelling. Section 3 presents the setup of a simulation case study based on a test building in Singapore. Section 4 presents the results of the simulation case study. The advantages, applicability, and limitations of the proposed event-triggered model predictive control are discussed in Section 5. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section 6. 2 Methodology 2.1 Overview of the proposed event-triggered model predictive control The framework of the proposed ML-based ETMPC is shown in Fig. 1 . The proposed ETMPC includes two key components i.e., an MPC controller and an ETM. At the initial optimization run, the MPC controller searches for the optimized manipulated variables (MVs) in the future prediction horizon based on the measured disturbances (MDs), measured outputs (MOs) of the building, and an ML-based building model. For ACMV control, the MVs are the cooling power setpoints. MDs for buildings include weather conditions and internal heat gains. MOs are building indoor conditions (e.g., PMV). Once MVs in the prediction horizon are obtained by the MPC controller, the information of MVs of the prediction horizon and the cost value of the MPC cost function corresponding to the MVs, are sent to the ETM component. At each control interval, the cost estimation module in the ETM component assesses the transition of the cost value with real-time MDs and MOs feedback. The event detector module in the ETM component determines the truth or falsehood of a triggering event based on the transition of the cost value, which will be detailed in Section 2.3. If the triggering event is False, MVs of the current control interval are sent to the building energy systems (e.g., ACMV) for real-time control. The process is repeated until a triggering event is True or the time has reached the end of the prediction horizon, then a new optimization is run to start a new prediction horizon. Further details of the MPC controller are given in Section 2.2. 2.2 MPC formulation As represented by Equation (1), the objective function of the MPC controller in Fig. 1 aims at minimizing the ACMV cooling energy used, the difference between indoor PMV and the PMV set point, as well as the infraction of the constraints during the prediction horizon. (1) J = M i n i m i z e ( ∑ k = 1 N Q ˙ c l g , t + k / s f Q ˙ + ∑ k = 1 N [ W P M V ( P M V t + k − P M V s p ) / s f P M V ] 2 + W ε ε t + k 2 ) , Equation (1) is subjected to the constraints described in Equations (2) and (3) as well as the building dynamics represented by an ML-based building model as described in Section 3.2. (2) 0 ≤ Q ˙ c l g ≤ Q ˙ c c , (3) − 0.5 − ε ≤ PMV ≤ 0.5 + ε . Symbols J, sf, W, PMV, Q ˙ , ε, and N denote objective (unitless), scale factor (unitless), weighting factor (unitless), predicted mean vote (unitless), heat flow rate (W), slack variable (unitless), and prediction horizon (control interval), respectively. Subscripts k, t, cc, sp, PMV, and clg denote the index variable of control interval, time, cooling capacity, set point, predicted mean vote, and cooling, respectively. Particularly, Q ˙ c l g , t + k , Q ˙ c c , P M V t + k , PMV ref , ε t + k , s f Q ˙ , sf pmv , W ε , and W pmv denote the cooling power at time t + k (W), cooling capacity (W), predicted mean vote at time t + k (unitless), reference value of predicted mean vote (unitless), slack variable at time t + k (unitless), scale factor of cooling power (unitless), scale factor of PMV (unitless), weighting factor of slack variable (unitless), weighting factor of PMV (unitless), respectively. The three cost items on the right-hand side of the objective function are the costs due to the cooling energy used by ACMV, PMV deviation from the pre-defined reference value, and the infraction of the PMV constraints, respectively. The value of 0, which represents thermal neutrality [30], is used for the set point of indoor PMV (PMV sp ). PMV sp can be a variable when demand response or online user feedback is considered (but such features are not covered in this study). Indoor PMV was constrained within (−0.5, 0.5), as shown in Equation (2), which is the comfortable indoor PMV range [30]. Cooling power was constrained between 0 and the full cooling capacity ( Q ˙ c c ) of the ACMV system, as shown in Equation (2). The slack variable (ε) can relax the indoor PMV constraint, which allows the indoor PMV to be beyond the constraint at the expense of adding cost (the third item on the right side) to the objective function [31]. The scale factors are to normalize the variables (cooling power and indoor PMV) in the objective function. The scale factors of cooling power and indoor PMV were set to be the magnitudes of their respective constraints described by Equation (2), i.e., sf PMV = Q ˙ c c , sf PMV = 1 for the thermal comfort range constraint of −0.5 ≤ PMV ≤0.5 used [29]. The weighting factor for the thermal discomfort cost (W PMV ) was set to be 5 while there was no weighting factor for the cooling power cost (i.e., weighting factor = 1). This setting drives the MPC controller to emphasize the reference PMV tracking over cooling energy use minimization. The weighting factor ( W ε ) for the third cost item in Equation (1) was set to be 10000, which gives very little tolerance to constraint violation. 5 min and 60 min were selected for the control interval and prediction horizon, respectively. The 5-min-long control interval is considered small enough to capture the dynamic change of indoor conditions (e.g., indoor air temperature and PMV). The 60-min-long prediction horizon, i.e., 12 control intervals, is also long enough to cover the dynamic response time of the indoor conditions for the current case. 2.3 Event-triggered mechanism for the proposed ETMPC At one optimization run, a sequence of MVs for all the control intervals within the prediction horizon (12 control intervals in this case) are generated by the MPC controller. However, in conventional MPC, only the MVs of the first control interval will be applied to the building for real-time control as per the operation principle of TTM. The remaining 11 control commands are discarded. To make better use of these remaining MVs so that the need to re-run the optimization is reduced, an ETM as illustrated in Fig. 2 was proposed. At the start of a prediction horizon, e.g., time t, an optimization run is conducted by the MPC controller to generate and send the MVs in the prediction horizon and the cost value (c 0 ) of the cost function described by Equation (1) to the ETM. The ETM then sends the MVs at the first control interval to the building energy systems (e,g., ACMV) for real-time control. Starting from the second control interval, instead of directly applying MVs to the building as TTM does, the ETM evaluates the cost value transition to decide whether to directly apply the MVs or to run a new optimization. As time progresses to t + k (2 ≤ k ≤ N-1), the ETM re-evaluates the cost value (c k ) of the prediction horizon using the MOs and MDs within the time of (t, t + k) fed back to the ETM. The ETM then calculates the discrepancy (e) between the re-evaluated cost (c k ) and c 0 according to the method defined in Equation (4). The ETM determines the truth/falsehood of the triggering event based on Equation (5). In the case that the triggering event is True, the ETM triggers a new optimization run in the MPC controller so that the next prediction horizon is started. In the case that the triggering event is False, the ETM sends the MVs of the current control interval (t + k) to the building energy systems for real-time control. The above process is executed at each control interval until the current prediction horizon is finished, then a new optimization run in the MPC controller is conducted for the subsequent prediction horizon. (4) e = | c k − c 0 | / c 0 . (5) t r i g g e r i n g e v e n t = { T r u e , i f e ≥ δ F a l s e , i f e < δ . In Equations (4) and (5), symbols e, c, and δ denote discrepancy, cost value, and threshold value, respectively. Particularly, c 0 and c k denote the cost value evaluated at the start of a prediction horizon (unitless) and the cost value re-evaluated at control interval k (unitless), respectively. Different values of δ were tested in the simulation case study as detailed in Sections 3.3 and 4. 2.4 Machine-learning-based building modelling In this paper, the recurrent neural network (RNN) was employed for ML-based modelling of the building dynamics for predicting indoor air conditions (e.g., indoor PMV). The nonlinear autoregressive exogenous (NARX) structure, as described in Equation (6), was adopted for the RNN. As a dynamic neural network, the NARX RNN has good performance for time-series predictions and, hence, is suitable for predicting the dynamic responses of building states [32]. The sigmoidal activation function that is widely used for RNN [34], is employed for the NARX RNN in this study. The NARX RNN inputs include MVs (i.e., ACMV cooling power) and MDs (external and internal heat gains) of the MPC controller. The NARX RNN outputs are MOs (i.e., indoor PMV) of the MPC controller. The NARX RNN size (the number of time delays in the inputs and feedback of outputs and the number of neurons in the hidden layer) was selected based on a \u2018trial-and-error\u2019 method detailed in the reference [33], where multiple trials of NARX RNN training were run with incremental NARX RNN sizes until the model errors cannot be further significantly decreased with larger size of the NARX RNN. (6) y t = f ( u t − 1 , u t − 2 , \u2026 u t − n u , y t − 1 , y t − 2 , ⋯ y t − n y ) . In Equation (6), symbols f(), y, u, and n denote function, output, input, and number. Particularly, y t , y t − 1 , y t − 2 , ⋯ y t − n y denote the output at time t, t-1, t-2, \u2026t-n y , respectively. u t − 1 , u t − 2 , \u2026 u t − n u denote the input at time t-1, t-2, \u2026t-n u , respectively. 3 Simulation case study setup 3.1 Test building The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed ML-based ETMPC were verified and assessed through simulations with a test building of Building and Construction Authority (BCA) SkyLab, as shown in Fig. 3 , located in Singapore. The test building has two side-by-side identical experimental cells, Test Cell and Reference Cell, which are configured to mimic typical office environments. The simulations were based on the Test Cell. The floor area of the cell is 43 m2. One of the side walls is a window façade consisting of a full-height exterior window. The cell has eight light fixtures and each has a maximum lighting power density of 8.2 W/m2. A total internal sensible load of 16 W/m2 is generated by the sensible load simulators. An internal latent load of 220 W, equivalent to 55 W per person for four persons, is generated by the latent load simulators, as shown in Fig. 3. The cell has a fan coil unit (FCU) installed, which consists of a supply air fan and a cooling coil. The supply air fan is a constant speed drive (CSD) type with a total airflow volume capacity of 540 L/s and fresh air flow rate of 26.2 L/s. The chilled water flow rate supplied to the cooling coil is regulated by a modulating water valve, which is controlled by a thermostat according to a room air temperature setpoint of 24 °C. The test building is equipped with a series of sensors in the room spaces, air conditioning system, and outdoor environment. A data acquisition system that monitors and stores the sensor data, including indoor air conditions (air temperature, humidity, globe temperature, air velocity), air conditioning system variables (both air loop and water loop), and weather conditions (air temperature, humidity, irradiance, illuminance). In the current simulation study, the test building operated on weekdays from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. The ACMV system, lights, and load simulators were switched on during the operating time and were switched off in the remaining time. Further details of the test building are described in previous studies [18,35]. A building model of the test building, constructed with the physics-based modelling approach and developed by Yang et al. [18], was used as a virtual testbed to represent the real dynamics of the building for the current simulation case study. The physics-based model employs a thermal resistance-capacitance (RC) network to represent each building's thermal component (indoor air, floor, roof, external and internal walls) to calculate the dynamic temperatures of these thermal masses. The physics-based model calculates the dynamic indoor humidity based on the moisture balance in the room space. The physics-based model also calculates the dynamic mean radiant temperature based on the inner surface temperatures of walls, floors, and roofs. With the calculated dynamic indoor air temperature, humidity, and mean radiant temperature, the physics-based model calculates the dynamic indoor PMV and predicted percentage of dissatisfied (PPD) based on the PMV model adopted by ISO 7730 [36] and ASHRAE Standard 55 [37]. Other input variables for the PMV/PPD calculation, including indoor air speed, occupant's clothing level, and occupant's metabolic rate, are set to constant values according to measured experiment data and typical occupant activities in office environments during the summer season. Further description of the physics-based model is in the previous study [18]. The physics-based model was calibrated with the measured operation data of the test building in the previous study [18]. After the model calibration, the mean absolute percentage errors (MAPE) of indoor air temperature and humidity predictions of the physics-based model against measured data are 1.55% and 4.93%, respectively. 3.2 Generation of machine-learning-based building model A simulation using the physics-based model described in Section 3.1 for a one-month-long operation was conducted to produce building operation data for generating the ML-based building model. The ML-based building model is a NARX RNN model described in Section 2.4, and its structure for the test building in the current case study is depicted in Fig. 4 . As the machine-learning-based building model is data-driven, it does not strictly follow the same inputs of the physics-based model described in Section 3.1. Compared to the physics-based model, the inputs of the machine-learning-based building model are decreased to reduce the possibility of overfitting. The input data of the ML-based building model include cooling power of the cooling coil in the ACMV system ( Q ˙ c l g ), global horizontal irradiance (GHI), outdoor air temperature (T o ), and the test building operation status (os) (0 \u2013 non-operating, 1 \u2013 in operating). GHI and outdoor air temperature represent external heat gains due to weather. Outdoor humidity is not considered in the inputs as it was found having minor impacts on the accuracy of the machine-learning-based building model. The internal heat gains, including both sensible and latent heat gains, from the lights and load simulators were represented by the operation status of the test building, os, for reducing the number of inputs, as the operation (on/off) of lights and load simulators in the test building is the same as the operation status of the test building in the simulation. The output of the ML-based building model includes indoor PMV. The inputs and outputs of the ML-based building model as well as the corresponding variable types when the ML-based building model is used by the MPC controller are listed in Table 1 . Typical meteorological year (TMY) data of Singapore [38] was used as the weather data for the simulation with the physics-based building model to generate the input/output data for the development of the ML-based building model. The simulation was conducted employing the weather data of April in the TMY data of Singapore. The weather in April in Singapore is in one of the two inter-monsoon seasons of Singapore [42] during which the weather is generally dryer, i.e., higher external heat gains to buildings, than that during the monsoon seasons. The cooling power supply from the ACMV system was generated at random and at 5-min intervals (i.e., control interval of the MPC controller) within 0%\u2013100% in the operating time and turned off in the remaining time for the simulation. The heat gains from the lights and load simulators operated according to the test building operation schedule as described in Section 3.1. The input/output data obtained from the simulation were divided into three subsets, of which 70% were used for training, 15% were used for validation, and the remaining data were used for testing, by randomly picking across the month-long simulation period. With the \u2018trial-and-error\u2019 method described in Section 2.4, the time delay of 1:2 was selected for the inputs and the feedback of outputs and the number of 10 neurons was selected for the hidden layer for the ML-based building model. The R values (coefficients of correlation) of the ML-based building model for the model training, validation, as well as testing phases were 0.986, 0.985, and 0.986, respectively, which suggests that the trained ML-based building model has high prediction accuracy in predicting indoor PMV. 3.3 Simulation setup for ETMPC control performance evaluation Simulations, including an MPC case, a series of ETMPC cases , and a conventional thermostat control case, were conducted for the evaluation of the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed ML-based ETMPC. The configuration of the MPC, ETMPC, and thermostat cases are as follows, a. MPC: Standard MPC with TTM that triggers optimization runs at each control interval. The formulation of the MPC controller is described in Section 2.2. b. ETMPC: Proposed ETMPC with ETM that triggers optimization runs according to triggering events. The system architecture of the ETMPC is described in Section 2.1. The formulation of the MPC controller and ETM of the ETMPC are illustrated in Sections 2.2 and 2.3, respectively. Various δ values ranging from 0.5% to 24% with an interval of 1.5% were tested. The range and intervals of δ settings were chosen based on the results of multiple trial ETMPC simulations. Further increase of δ beyond 24% had little effect on the control performance of ETMPC. The intervals were fine enough to capture the change in the control performance of ETMPC with δ. c. Thermostat: Conventional on/off control reactive to indoor air temperature feedback. The upper temperature bound for switching on the ACMV system (i.e., 100% of the cooling power of the cooling coil in the ACMV system) is 25 °C. The lower temperature bound for switching off the ACMV system (i.e., 0% of cooling power supply from the ACMV system) is 23 °C. This temperature range is recommended as the comfortable room air temperature range according to Singapore Standard 554 [39]. The manipulated variable, Q ˙ c l g , is the rate of cooling energy supplied by the cooling coil in the ACMV system described in Section 3.1 to remove the sensible heat and latent heat (i.e., moisture) of the supply air flowing through the coil. The cooled supply air then flows into the room space through diffusers to regulate the room conditions to achieve the control of indoor thermal comfort. The manipulated variable (i.e., cooling power) generated by the above-discussed MPC/ETMPC/Thermostat controllers can be achieved by regulating the opening of the chilled water valve of the ACMV system with a low-level controller (e.g., proportional-integral (PI) control) in the real world. The previous experiment studies [31,40,41] have details on the low-level control to achieve targeted cooling powers. As this study is based on simulations and focuses on event-triggered MPC, the low-level control process is not simulated in this study. TMY data [38] of Singapore was used as the weather data for the simulation case study. All the simulation cases were implemented with the weather of May, as shown in Fig. 5 (a), another inter-monsoon season month in Singapore [42]. The one-month-long simulation period consists of 23 workdays and eight off days. The operation of the test building was according to the operation schedule described in Section 3.1. The internal sensible and latent loads in Test Cell of the test building are shown in Fig. 5 (b). The three controllers were on when the test building was operating and were switched off during the remaining time. The simulations were implemented in the MATLAB/Simulink platform installed in a laptop computer with Intel(R) Core (TM) i7-7500U CPU and 24 GB memory. All the simulation results were saved at 5-min intervals, synchronizing with the control interval of the MPC controllers. The simulation results in the building operation time only were used to assess the control performance of the three controllers (MPC, ETMPC, and Thermostat). Control performance of the three controllers was evaluated in three aspects, including computation efficiency (except for the Thermostat, which does not involve optimization), thermal comfort, and energy use. The computation efficiency of the two MPC controllers was evaluated by the number of optimization runs for the simulation period. The thermal comfort performance was evaluated by the averaged PPD [36] as well as statistical indoor PMV distributions with boxplots. PPD is a quantitative prediction of the percentage of thermally dissatisfied (i.e., occupants feel too cool or too warm) occupants in a scale of 5%\u2013100% [36] and an acceptable thermal comfort range of 5%\u201310% dissatisfied [30]. Energy performance was assessed by the total cooling electricity use for the simulation period, which is calculated based on the cooling energy use. Cooling electricity use is obtained by dividing the cooling energy use obtained from the simulations by a representative coefficient of performance (COP = 5.87) of the chiller serving SkyLab. The representative COP is an average value of measured COP in SkyLab. 4 Simulation case study results 4.1 Simulation results on a typical day Fig. 6 is a stair-step plot showing the optimization runs (0 \u2013 False, 1 \u2013 True) of MPC and the proposed ETMPC (δ = 1.5%) for 9 a.m.\u20136 p.m. on a typical workday. The workday has an intermediate sky condition, which is common in Singapore [1]. Choosing to show the case of δ = 1.5% for ETMPC is because the number of optimization runs of this case (433) is about at the middle point of all ETMPC cases (293\u2013557) covered in the simulation study. Optimization runs in MPC were triggered at every control interval throughout the test building operating time of the day (108 optimization runs in total per day) due to the TTM employed. On the contrary, the triggering of optimization runs in the ETMPC case was largely reduced to 24 (less than a quarter of that in MPC) due to its ETM. In contrast to MPC, which only applied the optimal MVs (i.e., cooling power set points) of the first control interval to the ACMV system for real-time control, the ETMPC also applied the MVs of the rest control intervals when the discrepancy of cost value (Equation (4)) did not exceed the pre-defined threshold (i.e., δ = 1.5% for Fig. 6). Similar findings were also observed in other ETMPC cases (with different δ values) in the current simulation study. The results suggest that the ETMPC can largely cut down the computational load of MPC by significantly reducing the triggering of optimization runs, mitigating the reliance on costly high-power hardware in conventional TTM-based MPC. The importance of improving the computational efficiency of MPC through ETMPC is further discussed in Section 5.1. Fig. 7 shows the results of indoor PMV, indoor air temperature, as well as the normalized cooling power (ratio of cooling power to cooling capacity) of the three cases on the same typical workday as in Fig. 6. The indoor PMV, shown in Fig. 7 (a), was highly fluctuating in the thermostat case due to the thermostat's reactive-based control and on/off operation nature, as shown by the time series of normalized cooling power in Fig. 6 (c). Indoor air temperature generally followed the same trend, as can be seen in Fig. 6 (b). Indoor PMV went below the lower bound of the comfortable PMV range, i.e., −0.5, on many occasions throughout the day, indicating overcooling during these periods. In contrast to the thermostat case, the indoor PMV in the MPC case was kept at a much more comfortable level, i.e., much closer to thermal neutrality (PMV = 0) with much fewer fluctuations throughout the day. The ETMPC achieved similar performance in maintaining thermal comfort as the MPC did. The difference in control characteristics between the thermostat (reactive control) and the two MPC controllers can be seen in Fig. 6 (c). In the thermostat case, the cooling power supply was regulated in binary (i.e., 0% or 100%), echoing the fluctuating indoor PMV results shown in Fig. 7 (a). Both the MPC and ETMPC regulated cooling power in a much smoother manner as compared to the thermostat. 4.1.1 Simulation results during the entire simulation period Figs. 8\u201311 show the results of optimization runs, energy use, PPD, and PMV over the building operation time of the entire simulation period. Fig. 8 shows the total numbers of optimizations ran in the MPC case and ETMPC cases at different δ (described in Section 3.3). The data point at δ = 0% represents the MPC case and the rest of the data points (δ > 0) represent their corresponding ETMPC cases. ETMPC largely cut down the number of optimization runs from 2484 runs in MPC to 293\u2013557 runs, i.e., a reduction by 77.6%\u201388.2%, for the operation time of the simulation period. The significantly reduced optimization runs by ETMPC compared to MPC could largely reduce the computational load of MPC, which is a major technological barrier of MPC for real-time building control. Fewer optimization runs were needed with higher δ until δ reaches 19.5%, and the number of optimization runs cannot be further reduced with further increasing δ. Fig. 9 shows the energy performance results in the thermostat, MPC, and ETMPC cases for the building operation time over the entire simulation period. Fig. 9 (a) shows the cooling electricity use by ACMV (calculated based on cooling energy use as described in Section 3.3) of MPC and ETMPC with various δ values. The cooling electricity use was 168.7 kWh in the MPC case and 168.0\u2013168.1 kWh in the EMPC cases. The change in δ value in ETMPC did not show a significant effect on energy use. In comparison to MPC and ETMPC, the thermostat used a much higher 185.3 kWh of electricity for cooling. Fig. 9 (b) shows the percentage reductions of ACMV cooling electricity (ratio of cooling electricity reduction in the MPC/ETMPC cases as compared to the cooling electricity use of thermostat) in the MPC case and ETMPC cases with various δ values below the thermostat case. The MPC achieved a 9% of reduction in ACMV cooling electricity and the ETMPC reduced the ACMV cooling electricity by 9.3%\u20139.4% below the thermostat case. Hence, ETMPC could achieve about the same energy performance as MPC, i.e., more than a 9% of reduction in cooling electricity use below the thermostat case. Figs. 10 and 11 show the thermal comfort results of the three controllers in terms of average PPD and statistical PMV distribution, respectively, for the building operation time of the entire simulation period. The average PPD of the thermostat case is 8.34%. Fig. 11 (b) shows that indoor PMV of the thermostat case spreaded across a wide range (−0.592, 0.883) and also went beyond the comfortable range (−0.5, 0.5) for 35.6% of the time. In comparison, the average PPD was reduced to 5.62% in the MPC case, 5.64%\u20135.68% in the ETMPC cases, as shown in Fig. 10. These average PPD numbers were very close to the lower bound of the PPD scale (5%\u2013100%), suggesting that both the MPC and ETMPC can keep the indoor thermal comfort close to neutrality for most of the time, significantly improving from the thermostat case. Fig. 11 (a) shows that both the MPC and ETMPC maintained indoor PMV to a much narrower range (−0.04, 0.08) than the thermostat case, suggesting that both the MPC and ETMPC can maintain much more stable indoor thermal conditions than the thermostat can. Indoor PMV in both the MPC and ETMPC (for all δ settings used in the simulation study) cases only went beyond the comfortable range for 3.1% of the time (these data points are not shown in Fig. 11 as they are considered as outliers, i.e., outside 1.5 times of the interquartile range above the 75th quartile or below the 25th quartile, by the box plot). The results in Figs. 10 and 11 indicate that indoor thermal comfort was largely improved by the two MPC controllers as compared to the thermostat. Combining with the energy savings performance shown in Fig. 8, the superiority of the two MPC controllers over the thermostat is evident. Similar to that observed in the energy performance, the thermal comfort performance (as measured by average PPD) of ETMPC was very similar to MPC. For the various δ values tested, the average PPDs of the ETMPC cases were slightly higher than the MPC case by 0.02%\u20130.06%, which is practically negligible. Considering the aspects of computation efficiency, thermal comfort, and energy efficiency performance (as shown in Figs. 8\u201311), using the δ value of 19.5% for ETMPC would be most beneficial for the current study setup. As the degradation of control performance including thermal comfort and energy efficiency by ETMPC from MPC was negligible for the range of δ value covered in the simulations (0.5\u201324%), computation efficiency becomes the only remaining factor in the selection of δ values. With the δ value of 19.5%, the ETMPC achieved the largest reduction (88.2%) of optimization runs for MPC among all the δ values used in the simulations. The reduction (88.2%) of optimization runs of ETMPC with δ value of 19.5% is close to the theoretical maximum reduction obtainable for the current study setup (91.7%), i.e., when all control commands in the prediction horizon of each optimization run are applied to real-time building control. There is not much room to further reduce the number of optimization runs by increasing δ beyond 19.5%. Hence, the further increase of δ to beyond 19.5% can not lead to further benefits in terms of reducing optimization runs but may cause possible degradation of control performance with respect to energy saving and thermal comfort. 5 Discussion 5.1 Advantage of ETMPC over conventional MPC The proposed ETMPC significantly reduced the optimization runs by 77.6\u201388.6% in the simulations with similar energy performance and negligible thermal comfort degradation compared to the conventional MPC. The reduction of optimization runs by the ETMPC can largely lower the frequency of optimization runs from one run per 5 min in MPC to one run per 22.3\u201342.4 min on average in the various ETMPC cases, as shown in Fig. 12 . Buildings usually have multiple rooms and ACMV units; hence, multiple MPC controllers could be required for each room/ACMV unit. The simultaneous running of these multiple MPC controllers will require much more expensive BAC hardware in terms of computational power and communication bandwidth than current BAC hardware that is for fast and simple conventional control. With a much-reduced frequency of optimization runs, the proposed ETMPC can reduce the number of simultaneous optimization runs of multiple MPC controllers, hence, offering the potential to largely cut down the overall instantaneous computational power and network bandwidth requirements (i.e., control hardware requirement). Thus, these advantages of ETMPC can enhance the applicability of MPC for scale-up BAC applications. ETM is not building-specific but a generic mechanism universally applicable to MPC. The cost of adopting ETM to replace TTM in MPC should be minimal. The proposed ETMPC does not benefit energy-saving or thermal comfort compared to conventional MPC, as the only difference between the proposed ETMPC and conventional MPC is the optimization triggering mechanism, i.e., the proposed ETMPC does not affect the optimization problem (e.g., objective function, constraints, prediction horizon, and control interval). The case study results show that the energy-saving and thermal comfort performance of the proposed ETMPC is about the same as conventional MPC. Hence, the proposed ETMPC does not compromise the energy-saving and thermal comfort performance in reducing the computational load compared to conventional MPC. As this study focuses on applying event triggering mechanism (ETM) to MPC to reduce the computational load, this study compared the performance between MPCs with ETM and TTM to evaluate the benefits of ETM for MPC. Hence, the comparison between different ETM approaches for MPC is not considered in this study. However, a simple comparison between the proposed ETMPC and ETMPC with a conventional ETM was conducted in Appendix. The conventional ETM is from the literature [28] and is based on the current state, i.e., the discrepancy between the current indoor PMV and the set point value. The comparison results in Table A.1 suggest that the proposed ETM enabled MPC to reduce the optimization runs by more than 16% with similar electricity use and PPD performance compared to the conventional ETM. However, the comparison results are very preliminary and a systematic comparison between the proposed ETM and other ETM approaches will be conducted in future studies. 5.2 Applicability and limitations The proposed ETMPC shares similar applicability as conventional MPC as the only difference between them is the mechanism to trigger optimization actions. The ETMPC in the current case study employs an ML-based building model trained using the building operation data. Implementation of a similar ETMPC in another building will require a new ML-based model trained using the operation data of that building. In principle, the ETMPC can also employ a physics-based building model for building control, but the control performance needs further verifications. The ETMPC was used to control an ACMV system for a single-zone office environment in this study. However, it can be extended to different types of buildings. For buildings with heating systems, the building model needs to be modified to include the heating systems. For buildings with multiple rooms, an ETMPC controller needs to be developed for each room for individual room control. The proposed ETMPC does not affect the optimization problem (e.g., objective function, constraints, prediction horizon, and control interval). Hence, same as conventional MPC, the objective function of the proposed ETMPC can also be modified (e.g., include the dynamic efficiency of the ACMV system) to improve the energy-saving performance. The current study has some limitations that need to be addressed in future works. The control performance of ETMPC was assessed through only simulations for one building in this study and its control performance needs further verifications through experiments in different buildings. In addition, the resilience of the proposed ETMPC for different weather conditions (e.g., winter season) and different building models (e.g., physics-based building model) also needs further verifications in future works. 6 Conclusion The high computational power demand associated with the running of optimization in MPC has been a major technological barrier prohibiting its popularity in real building implementations. This study proposed a machine-learning-based event-triggered model predictive control (ETMPC) for simultaneous optimization of building energy efficiency and occupants\u2019 wellbeing. The proposed ETMPC features an event-triggered mechanism that runs optimization only when necessary instead of periodically running optimization at each control interval as in conventional MPC. Under the settings of the current study, the ETMPC can largely cut down the computational load by 77.6%\u201388.2% by reducing the number of optimization runs as compared to the conventional MPC. Despite so, the ETMPC still achieved similar energy performance as the conventional MPC did. The ETMPC achieved a 9.3%\u20139.4% reduction in cooling energy use compared to the thermostat, very similar to the 9.0% achieved by the conventional MPC. In parallel, the ETMPC improved thermal comfort by reducing the average predicted percentage of dissatisfied (PPD) from 8.34% in the thermostat case to 5.64%\u20135.68%, very similar to the 5.62% achieved by the conventional MPC. The current study demonstrated that ETMPC can significantly cut down the high computational power demand while achieving similar control performance to conventional MPC, hence, enhancing the applicability of MPC for buildings. The selection of a threshold to determine the triggering event affected the computation efficiency but had a negligible impact on the thermal comfort and energy performance of the event-triggered model predictive control. A best threshold setting for ETMPC to achieve the largest reduction of optimization runs for the current study setup was identified.

Appendix A simple comparison between the proposed ETM in this study and a typical conventional ETM from the literature [28] was conducted. The conventional ETM is based on the current state, i.e., the discrepancy between the current indoor PMV and the set point value defined in (A.1). The definition of the truth/falsehood of the triggering event is the same as Equation (5), i.e., the triggering event is true when e is greater than or equal to the threshold ( δ ) otherwise it is false. (A.1) e = | P M V k − P M V s p | / | P M V u b − P M V s p | . Three simulation cases of ETMPC with the above conventional ETM (\u2018Conventional ETMPC\u2019) were conducted, and the performance was compared to the proposed ETMPC described in Sections 2.3, as shown in Table A.1. Three δ values (3%, 12%, and 21%) were considered in these three Conventional ETMPC simulation cases, respectively. The three δ values could represent the low, middle and high δ values considered in simulation cases of the proposed ETMPC (\u2018Proposed ETMPC\u2019) described in Section 3.3. The simulation setup of the Conventional ETMPC cases is the same as the Proposed ETMPC cases described in Section 3.3, except for the ETM. Table A.1 shows that the Proposed ETMPC cases reduced the optimization runs by more than 16% with similar electricity use and PPD performance compared to the Conventional ETMPC cases.

        "dc:description": "Model predictive control (MPC) for building energy management has exhibited a huge potential for largely cutting down energy use and improving human comfort. However, the high demand for computational power for solving the optimization is challenging the widespread deployment of MPC in real buildings. Typical MPC employs a time-triggered mechanism (TTM) that runs optimization recurrently at each time step without considering the necessity, which could cause excessive computation resource usage. This paper proposes an event-triggered mechanism (ETM) that only runs optimization when triggering events occur. Contrary to conventional ETMs that only considers the current information (e.g., room conditions), the ETM proposed is based on a cost function that covers the past, current, and future information. Based on the proposed ETM, a machine-learning-based event-triggered model predictive control (ETMPC) system that optimizes both building energy efficiency and thermal comfort is developed. The developed ETMPC system is then employed for air-conditioning control for performance evaluation through simulations. The control performance of the proposed ETMPC is compared to an MPC employing TTM and a common thermostat. Compared to the MPC employing TTM, the proposed ETMPC reduced the computational load in terms of the number of optimization runs by 77.6%\u201388.2%, meanwhile, achieving similar energy savings (more than 9.3% energy saving over the thermostat) as the MPC employing TTM does (9% energy saving over the thermostat). With the significant reduction of computational load, the ETMPC achieves similar thermal comfort performance as the MPC employing TTM does, and it is significantly better over the thermostat.",
