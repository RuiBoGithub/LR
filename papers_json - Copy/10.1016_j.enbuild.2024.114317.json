To analyze the energy-saving potential of commercial kitchen ventilation and air-conditioning (VAC) systems and to create a good kitchen environment, this paper calculates the key influential parameters of the exhaust air volume and air supply temperature through CFD simulation. The former depends on the fume control effect and is closely related to the make-up air method, while the latter is governed by the thermal comfort. The energy consumption under different operational strategies is calculated using EnergyPlus. The following conclusions were obtained: (1) By summing the demand exhaust rate of the cookers with that of the fume hoods during the operation of multiple cookers, the pollution control effect can still be satisfied. Moreover, the airflow can be reduced by 20% through airflow optimization. (2) During summer, the conditioned airflow should constitute 30% of the total make-up air volume, with an air supply temperature of 22 ℃. Conversely, in winter, the conditioned airflow should comprise 40% of the total make-up air volume, with an air supply temperature of 14 ℃. (3) It is advisable to use a personalized conditioned air supply to create a local thermal environment, effectively reducing the energy consumption of ventilation and air conditioning systems. The energy-saving rates achieved through airflow optimization and on-demand ventilation are 51% and 71%, respectively.

According to data released by the American Restaurant Association in 2011, one in ten U.S. workers was employed in a restaurant [1], with most chefs spending 80% of their time in the kitchen [2]. Employers are obligated to provide a compliant work environment for their employees, which in turn contributes to employer profitability. Studies indicate that when the temperature in the kitchen workspace exceeds the comfort temperature by 5.5 °C, employee productivity decreases, necessitating three additional employees to accomplish the same tasks [3]. Commercial kitchens are characterized by concentrated heat and humidity sources, substantial heat generation, and humidity dissipation during cooking, high indoor temperatures, and pronounced asymmetric thermal radiation. The operating area experiences high-temperature heat radiation from stove fires and the interference of cooking oil fumes (COF) due to thermal buoyancy, resulting in a suboptimal indoor thermal environment [4]. Regarding the thermal environment in commercial kitchens, ASHRAE Standard 55/2010 defines thermal comfort as \u201cthe psychological state of being satisfied with the thermal environment as assessed by subjective evaluation.\u201d Factors affecting human thermal comfort in the kitchen can be categorized into environmental and individual factors [5]. The former include air temperature, radiation, air flow rate, and air humidity, which can be influenced by VAC systems [6]. To quantitatively evaluate the kitchen thermal environment to guide the direction of improvement, predicted mean vote (PMV), predicted percentage of dissatisfied (PPD), and standard effective temperature (SET) are widely used to evaluate the thermal comfort of kitchen workers in scenarios such as university canteens [7] and railway dining cars [8]. Measurements and experiments have shown that introducing unconditioned makeup air into a kitchen affects the temperature and humidity of the space [3]. Li et al. [9] found that the average temperature in the operating area ranged from 41.5\u201354.0 °C during cooking, significantly impacting the thermal comfort of kitchen workers. Therefore, installing air conditioning systems in commercial kitchens is deemed necessary. Wang Gang et al. [10] investigated an air-conditioning system combining post-conditioned air and ceiling-conditioned air. They found that when the makeup air volume constituted 90% of the exhaust air volume, the air-conditioning system only needed to handle 20% of the makeup air load to improve the thermal environment in commercial kitchens. A study of elementary and secondary school cafeterias in the United States found that better kitchen thermal environments were created when the temperature difference between the make-up air and the kitchen space was 10 °C or less [11]. Li Ziqiang [12] examined the effect of kitchen conditioned air velocity on thermal comfort and found that when the velocities of fresh air make-up air and conditioned make-up air were 1.72 m/s and 1.62 m/s respectively from the strip air outlet, the conditioned make-up air failed to effectively envelope the human body due to the higher exit velocity. Conversely, utilizing a VAC system with diffused fresh air and strip supply, the thermal environment in commercial kitchens improved when the velocity of diffused fresh air was 0.45 m/s and the proportion of conditioned air constituted 40% of the total make-up air. Khalil and Akhdar [13] investigated the air supply through post-air-conditioning aperture panels positioned on the ceiling. They found that a larger area of air supply and lower air supply velocities led to improved human thermal comfort. This indicates that employing a VAC system comprising exhaust, makeup air, and air conditioning serves as a common solution to address issues related to COF contamination and thermal comfort in commercial kitchens. However, due to the significant heat and moisture dissipation from cookers, it is essential to increase the number of air changes to ensure acceptable indoor air quality. Additionally, a substantial amount of air-conditioned treated fresh air must be introduced to ensure an acceptable indoor thermal environment [4]. A low airflow rate can lead to indoor air quality problems, while a high airflow rate may lead to unnecessary energy consumption and increased lifecycle costs of the system [14]. In China, HVAC systems account for 65% of the total energy consumption in food service building [15], with 24\u201336% of the total energy consumed by food service facilities attributed to VAC systems [11]. To address energy consumption issues, the key for VAC systems lies in optimizing the existing ventilation system to reduce the demand exhaust rate under the same load, thereby lowering the energy required for fan operation and makeup air conditioning [16]. Zhang [17] et al. conducted a field study of commercial kitchens, and the results of a subjective questionnaire showed that more than 80% of chefs felt that there were problems with COF escape and excessive exhaust hood noise during the cooking process, so it is critical to accurately assess the exhaust airflow. In addition to the structure of the fume hood itself, the size of the exhaust air volume is also related to the cooking mode and the location of the cooker equipment [18], and the exhaust air volume can be reduced by optimizing the airflow organization [19\u201321]. CFD is the most common and effective method to obtain the flow and temperature fields in kitchen space and further optimize the VAC system. By embedding UDF, the specific values of thermal comfort indexes such as PMV/PPD can be calculated to guide the optimization direction of the kitchen VAC system. Alam et al. used the SET index to determine the thermal comfort state, and used CFD analysis to design the ventilation system of kitchen of non-air conditioned [22] and air-conditioned [23] pantry car on Indian railways, and obtained the parameters of the VAC system with a comfortable thermal sensation. In addressing the energy consumed by cookers and ancillary equipment, a key focus is on mitigating the wasted VAC energy resulting from the intermittent operation of equipment. Shen Liang [24] observed that in large public buildings like restaurants and banquet halls, mealtimes typically concentrate between 7:30\u20139:30, 11:30\u201313:30, and 17:30\u201320:30. Gao Xing [25] noted that research on equipment usage time in actual hotel kitchens found that although hotel kitchens operate for 11 to 15 h daily, the maximum gas usage time for 100% of the designed capacity is only about 1 to 2 h, with 80% of the usage time falling within the range of 2 to 3 h. This discrepancy arises because, in commercial kitchens, the use of equipment such as cooking appliances, stir-fry stations, steam cabinets, and dishwashers often occurs staggered throughout the day. Consequently, gas is not in continuous use, yet the exhaust system operates at 100% airflow, resulting in significant energy wastage. Similarly, the air conditioning system in commercial kitchens should operate at variable frequencies due to fluctuations in indoor load. During working hours, the cooking process and heat dissipation from meals lead to substantial increases in indoor air conditioning loads, resulting in large peaks, while these loads decrease rapidly during non-working hours [26,27]. The Demand Control Kitchen Ventilation (DCKV) system presents an effective solution to the intermittent operation of equipment. This system not only allows for adjustment of the exhaust air according to the scenario that also facilitates the corresponding adjustment of makeup air and VAC systems to match the air volume [28]. McKeever [29] applied the DCKV system in real-world scenarios such as school cafeteria and fast-food restaurant kitchens, adjusting the exhaust air volume between 100% and 80%. The study concluded that regardless of whether it was a cafeteria or fast-food restaurant, the DCKV system effectively reduced operational energy consumption, thereby generating economic benefits. This reduction in operational energy consumption proves advantageous economically. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency granted the Emerging Technology Award for On-demand Ventilation Systems in 2015 [30], aiming to promote the widespread adoption of DCKV systems in commercial kitchens. However, it is important to acknowledge that effective airflow regulation relies on the premise that the exhaust hood can effectively capture and control COF while establishing a favorable thermal environment in the kitchen. Based on the above analysis, it is important to investigate the VAC system of commercial kitchens. This entails determining scientifically and reasonably organized airflow and appropriate air volumes for each component. Subsequently, a corresponding operational strategy should be formulated according to the working characteristics of real commercial kitchens. Such efforts are aimed at improving air quality, thermal comfort, and reducing energy consumption within commercial kitchen environments. However, few studies have simultaneously addressed the need to balance thermal comfort and energy-saving operations in commercial kitchens. This aim of this study is to analyze the energy-saving potential of commercial kitchen VAC systems and to create a good kitchen environment. To address the thermal comfort and energy-saving optimization challenges in a commercial kitchen in Shanghai, this study employed CFD to determine the required exhaust rate and optimal makeup air method based on the COF. Subsequently, the air supply parameters of the VAC system were determined using thermal comfort indicators. Furthermore, based on these VAC system parameters, three operational strategies were designed, and EnergyPlus was used to calculate the energy consumption for both daily and yearly periods. This facilitated the identification of an energy-saving operation strategy for the commercial kitchen VAC system with DCKV. 2 Materials and methods A commercial kitchen in Shanghai was selected as the study area for this work. As shown in Fig. 1 (a), the cooking room is divided into two connected areas, A and B, by a middle partition wall. Area A contains four square and two round woks, while area B contains five universal steam ovens and two round woks, modeled as shown in Fig. 1 (b). The fume hoods in Areas A and B are of identical size. In addition to the cooker and fume hoods, both areas A and B of the cooking room are equipped with operating tables (with a height of 0.8 m), and refrigerators and storage cabinets are placed on both sides of the cooking area. The square work, as shown in Fig. 2 (a), boasts a large capacity suitable for stir-frying, steaming, and boiling various ingredients. Its working modes include heating and pouring to pick up food after cooking. It is characterized by a large emissive area and low emissive velocity. However, the round wok, shown in Fig. 2 (b), represents the most common Chinese cooker and is primarily used for stir-frying and deep-frying. It is characterized by a high emission rate and high surface temperature. The universal steam oven, as shown in Fig. 2 (c), represents a new type of automated commercial cooker capable of achieving large-volume standardized production of dishes with high stability and dish quality. Its working modes include heating and picking up food after cooking. In the heating mode, it is characterized by a concentrated source of emissions and a high emission temperature, while in the food pickup mode, it exhibits a large emission area, low emission temperature, and speed. The heat-source temperature, size, and emission characteristics of the cookers are listed in Table 1 . The makeup air currently used in this commercial kitchen comprises a combination of hood front orifice plate makeup air and ceiling makeup air, as shown in Fig. 3 (a). In the pursuit of optimizing airflow organization to reduce VAC system airflow, this study also investigated alternative configurations, including the hood\u2019s front orifice plate makeup air + attachment makeup air combination, shown in Fig. 3 (b); post-ceiling makeup air + ceiling makeup air combination, depicted in Fig. 3 (c); and post-ceiling makeup air + attachment makeup air combination, shown in Fig. 3 (d). The hood\u2019s front orifice plate makeup air and post-ceiling makeup air are categorized as near makeup air, while the ceiling makeup air and attachment makeup air fall under far makeup air. The positions and dimensions of each makeup air inlet are listed in Table 2 . In this study, CFD was used to simulate the temperature, velocity, and concentration fields in commercial kitchens, aiming to determine the demand exhaust rate of the fume hood and the air-conditioning supply parameters. Previous studies [31] have conducted grid independence analysis and simulation verification, as detailed in the Supplementary File . Measurement of environmental parameters was completed by referring to standard measurement methods in existing studies [32\u201334], and measurement points were selected according to international standards such as ASHRAE/ISO, and, all the above work was done in previous studies. Additionally, EnergyPlus 9.5 was used to calculate the energy consumption, enabling the analysis of the energy-saving potential of the commercial kitchen. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Exhaust air volume 3.1.1 Basic demand exhaust rate The ASTM F1704-12 (2017) standard [35] uses C&C efficiency (Capture and Containment efficiency) to evaluate the performance of fume hoods in the commercial kitchens, Capture efficiency is used to measure the proportion of fumes that enter the hood from the area underneath the hood, and control efficiency is used to measure the proportion of fumes that remain inside the hood without spilling out. This efficiency is defined by the minimum amount of exhaust air required to keep the fumes just out of the overflow, obtained by visualization experiments in a standard laboratory, and is less generalizable. Based on the C&C efficiency, related scholars have proposed Cre for calculating the capture and control efficiency based on the assumption of uniform distribution of pollutants in a certain area of the kitchen space [26,36]: C re = c e - c r c e where ce is the concentration of pollutants in the exhaust air, measured in mg/m3, and cr is the concentration of pollutants in the room, also measured in mg/m3. On this basis, the IF (Intake Fraction) was chosen to evaluate the effectiveness of localized pollutant control in the breathing zone, reflecting the pollutant exposure of the human body. IF is calculated using the following formula: IF = c b · V b c e · V e < 1 × 1 0 - 5 where cb represents the pollutant concentration in the breathing zone, mg/m3, Vb denotes the human breathing volume, m3/h, and Ve refers to the exhaust rate, m3/h. C re and IF are used in this paper as the evaluation indexes of the fume control effect of the hood. The judgment criteria stipulate that C re exceeds 20 [37], and the amount of pollutants inhaled by the human body decreased by five orders of magnitude compared to the amount of pollutants in the exhaust air. This implies that at least 95% of the pollutants are controlled by the exhaust hood. The exhaust demand rate of the exhaust hood under the existing makeup air method (Fig. 3 (a)) served as the basic demand exhaust rate. In this section, we calculate C re and IF at different exhaust rates and makeup air distribution ratios, subsequently determining the basic demand exhaust rate for different cookers. The calculation results for the heating mode of the square wok are shown in Fig. 4 , with additional figures available in the Supplementary File . The results show that the basic demand exhaust rates for the square wok during heating and meal pickup modes are 4,500 m3/h and 5,000 m3/h, respectively. For the round wok, the basic demand exhaust rate is 6,000 m3/h. Similarly, the basic demand exhaust rates for the universal steaming oven during heating and meal pickup modes are 1,500 m3/h and 4,000 m3/h, respectively. To verify the exhaust demand rate of the exhaust hood when multiple cookers are simultaneously in operation, all cookers are set in heating mode. The sum of the demand exhaust rates of all cookers is considered as the base exhaust rates of all cookers the exhaust hood. Subsequently, it is verified whether the base exhaust rate satisfies the COF pollution control requirements. Given the negligible mutual interference between the stoves, the fume control effect of the exhaust hood in areas A and B was evaluated individually using IF and C re. The results are summarized in Tables 3 . The exhaust rate obtained by summing the demand exhaust rates of typical cookers in multi-cooker scenarios remains sufficient to meet pollutant control requirements. The optimal pollutant control effect in multi-cooker working conditions was also observed with the combination of 20% hood front makeup air and 80% ceiling makeup air. This indicates that different makeup air modes align with the airflow organization principles in multi-cooker working conditions. 3.1.2 Optimization of demand exhaust rate Makeup air significantly enhances COF control by optimizing airflow organization within the kitchen space. Fisher et al. [38] demonstrated this by optimizing airflow organization through installing exhaust hood-side baffles. They achieved the same pollutant control effect while reducing exhaust air volume by 30% in 90% of the fume hood cases. In this subsection, we investigate the demand exhaust rate of the fume hood under the optimization of the makeup air method. We select four makeup air combinations: 20%+80% and 40%+60% for near and far makeup air combinations, respectively. The exhaust rates are set to 80%, 70%, 60%, and 50% of the base exhaust rate (where the base exhaust rate is the sum of the single-oven demand exhaust rates mentioned earlier). The simulation results are organized as shown in Fig. 5 , where each 90° area represents a makeup air method, and each makeup air method contains four exhaust rates. For each type of exhaust volume, two differently colored fan-shaped areas in the clockwise direction represent C re of areas A and B. The size of the fan-shaped area correlates positively with C re, and the fan-shaped area filled with diagonal lines indicates that the concentration of pollutants in the breathing zone meets the control standard. The dashed circle corresponds to C re of 20. Therefore, a fan-shaped area filled with and exceeding the dashed circle signifies that the pollutant-control effect of the commercial kitchen meets the requirements under the corresponding working conditions. When the exhaust air volume was set at 80% of the basic demand exhaust rate, 3/4 of the conditions met the pollutant control standards. Furthermore, when the exhaust air volume was reduced to 70% of the basic demand exhaust rate, the combination of 20%\u201340% post-makeup air + 60%\u201380% ceiling makeup air still satisfied the pollutant control standards. However, as the exhaust air volume continued to reduce to 60% or 50% of the basic demand exhaust rate, the pollutant control effectiveness of all makeup air methods deteriorated. 3.2 Air conditioning air supply parameters In pursuit of both thermal comfort and low energy consumption, this section focuses on determining the air supply volume and temperature for air conditioning. It is noted that conditioning all makeup air would lead to a significant overall increase in energy consumption. Therefore, it is deemed sufficient to create a favorable local thermal environment instead. In Section 3.1.2, the optimal makeup air ratio was established as 20%\u201340% post-makeup air + 60%\u201380% ceiling makeup air. Consequently, this section investigates conditioned makeup air ratios of 20%, 30%, and 40% of the total makeup air volume. Here, the post makeup air is conditioned air, while the ceiling makeup air is fresh air. The conditioned air supply temperature range is determined by adding or subtracting 4 ℃ from the central temperature calculated based on the air conditioning load, assuming 20% of the fresh air load. Therefore, the conditioned air supply temperature is 14\u201322 ℃ for summer and 12\u201320 ℃ for winter. 3.2.1 Thermal comfort indexes The predicted mean vote (PMV)/predicted percentage of dissatisfied (PPD) and percent dissatisfied (PD) were used as evaluation indices. The PMV and PPD models [39] are based on the thermal comfort equation to evaluate the thermal environment, while PD is a prediction model proposed by Fanger, commonly used to evaluate the sensation of air movement [40]. The PMV-PPD are calculated as follows. PMV = 0.303 e - 0.036 M + 0.028 M - W - 3.05 × 10 - 3 5733 - 6.99 M - W - P a - 0.42 M - W - 58.15 - 1.7 × 10 - 5 M 5867 - P a - 1.4 × 10 - 3 M 34 - T a - 3.96 × 10 - 8 f cl T cl + 273 4 - T r + 273 4 - f cl h c T cl - T a PPD = 100 - 95 e - 0.03353 P M V 4 - 0.2179 P M V 2 PD = 34 - T a V ¯ - 0.05 0.62 0.37 V ¯ T u + 3.14 where M is the metabolic rate (W/m2), W is the body's output work (W/m2), Pa is the partial pressure of water vapor (kPa), Ta is the local air temperature (℃), fcl is the ratio of the surface area of the clothed body to that of the naked body, Tcl is the temperature of the outer surface of the clothed body (℃), Tr is the average radiant temperature (℃), hc is the coefficient of convective exchange (W/(m2*K)),\u2014V is the air flow velocity (m/s) and T is the turbulence intensity. These three indices were calculated using CFD software by implementing UDF code in this study. 3.2.2 Summer air-conditioning air supply parameters Fig. 6 shows the observation planes for Zones A and B, situated 1.50 m away from the wall adjacent to the fume hood. The thermal environment parameters at this plane effectively reflect the thermal comfort of the staff and allow for comparisons of the impact of different stoves on the thermal environment. This provides valuable insights for the design of kitchen air conditioning. The Supplementary File contains simulated results of thermal environments for various make-up air scenarios with different air-conditioning temperatures, including scenarios without air conditioning. The thermal environments under different makeup air scenarios without air conditioning showed a consistent pattern. The PMV in the working area near the fume hood averaged around 2.0, indicating a sensation of warmth. PPD ranged from 50\u201370%, signifying significant dissatisfaction, while the PD remained relatively low, typically ranging from 10%\u201330%. Commercial kitchens without air conditioning experienced poor thermal comfort, especially in areas housing square and round woks. These areas, characterized by higher heat source temperatures and greater heat dissipation, exacerbated thermal discomfort, particularly evident during summer. In the case of air-conditioned makeup air, the thermal environment at the top of the work area (Y > 1.50 m) experienced significant improvement due to the vertically blowing conditioned air directly onto the workers\u2019 heads and faces. With a conditioned supply air temperature of 22 °C, the PMV at the top of the work area (Y > 1.50 m) ranged from -0.5 to 0.5, PPD < 30% and PD < 40%. Notably, when the proportion of conditioned makeup air was set to 30%, the comfortable area with PMV = 0 expanded significantly compared to the other two conditions. When the air supply temperature of air conditioning system fell below 22 ℃, the expansion of the \u201cmoderate\u201d PMV area was not pronounced, and certain areas experienced PMV reading in the \u201cslightly cool\u201d or \u201ccool\u201d range. Moreover, areas with PPD < 30% decreased rather than increasing, while the PD gradually increased in the upper areas, reaching 100 % in some locations. The optimal make-up air setting is 30% for post conditioned air + 70% for ceiling make-up air, with an air supply temperature of 22 °C, as shown in Fig. 7 , depicting the corresponding thermal environment. 3.2.3 Winter air-conditioning air supply parameters Compared with the unconditioned summer scenario, the PPD for the unconditioned winter condition mostly remained below 40%, indicating a lower dissatisfaction level compared to summer. This disparity arises from the high temperatures generated from commercial kitchen cookers, compounded by the presence of radiant heat, which increases their temperatures. However, the PD for most kitchen areas in winter ranged from 60% to 70%, significantly higher than the 10% to 30% observed in summer. This discrepancy can be attributed to the fact that dynamic air movement can significantly improve thermal comfort in a \u201cneutral-hot\u201d environment [41], while in a \u201ccold-neutral\u201d condition, dynamic air tends to induce a sensational of cold blowing [42]. In the conditioned make-up air scenario, using 14 ℃ air conditioning can significantly improve the thermal environment at the top of the working area (>1.50 m), reducing the PMV from -1.5 ∼ -1.0 without air conditioning to -0.5 ∼ 0.5, with PPD reduced to approximately 20%. However, the improvement in the thermal environment at the bottom was limited, with the dissatisfaction rate for the blowing sensation reduced to about 10% at the top but remaining at 70% at the bottom. As the conditioned air temperature rises, the PMV in the working area continues to rise to around 1.5, while the PPD decreases at temperatures above 14 °C. Therefore, the optimal form of conditioned make-up air in winter is 40% for post conditioned air and 60% for ceiling make-up air, with an air conditioning supply temperature of 14 °C, as shown in Fig. 8 illustrating the corresponding thermal environment. 3.3 Commercial kitchen energy consumption analysis 3.3.1 Commercial kitchen energy consumption modeling Taking the commercial kitchen as the object of energy consumption simulation, the corresponding model was established using DesignBuilder as shown in Fig. 9 . The three areas of the model are the dining room, the kitchen, and the work area. The dining room area has constant temperature and humidity all year round and provides infiltration air for the kitchen. The kitchen has only internal walls, and solar radiation and heat transfer from the external walls are not considered. The purpose of dividing the working area is to study the energy consumption of the ventilation system under local air-conditioning supply. The usage schedule for each cooker and ventilation system in the commercial kitchen, obtained from the field study, is shown in Fig. 10 . Cooking activities commence at 09:30 and conclude at 18:30 daily. In Fig. 10, the red portion signifies the cooker heating mode, the yellow part represents the pick-up mode, and the green part represents the off mode. The occupancy density was 0.10 persons/m2, and the lighting power density was 11.40 W/m2, following the same schedules as the ventilation system. Other equipment included a 24-hour always-on freezer and UV lamps with a total power of 5.2 kW. The main cooker power was 20 kW for the square wok, 25 kW for the round wok, and 28 kW for the universal steam oven. EnergyPlus 9.5.0 was used for energy simulation. The VAC system utilized a full fresh-air system with terminal fan coils, and the associated loads were managed by the cooling tower and air source heat pump during summer and winter, respectively. Cooling and heat sources, exhaust fans, and makeup air fans were automatically sized in EnergyPlus 9.5.0 based on typical daily operating conditions. (1) The first category is Constant Air Volume, where the exhaust air volume remains fixed as the basic demand exhaust rate. All make-up air is conditioned air with an air supply temperature of 22 ℃ in summer and 14 ℃ in winter. The indoor design temperature for air conditioning is set at 26 ℃ in summer and 14 ℃ in winter (the same hereinafter). The cooker is turned on and off corresponding to the switches of the exhaust, make-up air and air-conditioning, respectively. The VAC system does not have the function of air volume adjustment. (2) The second category is Airflow Optimization, where the exhaust rate is set to 80% of the basic demand exhaust rate. The air conditioner only regulates the air in the working area without bearing the hot and cold loads of the entire kitchen. The conditioned makeup air rate is 30% in summer and 40 % in winter. (3) The third category is Airflow Optimization + DCKV. In this category, the exhaust and makeup air volumes are adjusted according to the variation in the cooker\u2019s operating mode. The variation patterns of the exhaust air volume throughout the day under the three operational strategies are shown in Fig. 11 . 3.3.2 Energy consumption of typical day for commercial kitchens By analyzing the energy consumption throughout the day, we can obtain the variation in energy consumption at different times and identify the energy-saving potential in each part. By comparing the proportion of energy consumption in each part, it is possible to understand the annual energy consumption data. The total energy consumption of commercial kitchens includes fans, air conditioning, and kitchen equipment. Fan energy consumption includes exhaust fan and makeup air fan energy consumption, where conditioned air is a part of the makeup air. Air-conditioning energy consumption refers to the summer cooling or winter heating energy consumption, which, combined with fan energy consumption, constitutes the VAC system\u2019s energy consumption. Kitchen equipment energy consumption includes that of cookers, personnel, lighting, freezers, and ultraviolet lamps, operating independently of the VAC system. Therefore, the energy consumption of kitchen equipment remains consistent across all three operating scenarios. 3.3.2.1 Energy consumption of typical day in summer The weather files used for the energy consumption simulation were obtained from Tsinghua University and the China Meteorological Administration. For the typical summer day, August 15 was selected, with outdoor air dry and wet bulb temperatures recorded at 30.5 °C and 20.2 °C, respectively. Fig. 12 shows the hourly energy consumption data for a typical summer day, including energy consumption values from 8:00 to 19:00. When the cookers are activated, total energy consumption in commercial kitchens increases rapidly, peaking at 10:00 and 16:00. The surge is attributed to all the cookers being in heating mode and operating at their highest power during these intervals. Concurrently, the kitchen\u2019s heat load reaches its peak, resulting in maximum fan and cooling energy consumption. The energy consumption patterns observed throughout the day in commercial kitchens, as simulated in this study, are consistent with those in the literature [43]. The literature reports the working hours for commercial kitchen stoves spanning from 10:00 to 22:00, with energy consumption peaking twice during the day, at 13:00 and 20:00, respectively. The correspondence reflects the accuracy of the operation strategy employed in this study. The energy consumption share (15%) in the constant-airflow strategy was lower than that in the other operating strategies because the air conditioner bore the entire kitchen load in the constant-airflow strategy. In contrast, the air conditioner in the airflow optimization strategy only caters to the local thermal environment in the work area, significantly reducing energy consumption; consequently, the fan energy share is correspondingly higher. However, DCKV exhibits slightly lower fan energy consumption compared to the airflow optimization strategy because the air conditioner energy consumption remains essentially the same in both strategies. Fan energy consumption is determined by the airflow rate, which is further reduced in the case of DCKV, resulting in lower fan energy consumption. Comparing the energy consumption of the VAC system with the total energy consumption of the commercial kitchen under different operation strategies, the share of energy consumption of the VAC system was 27%, 15%, and 10% from operation strategies 1 to operation strategy 3. This shows that if the air conditioning system bears the entire load, it will significantly increase the energy consumption of the VAC system. Conversely, employing air conditioning solely for local thermal environments is a more reasonable approach that can reduce the energy consumption of the VAC system by approximately half on a typical summer day in Shanghai. However, the energy-saving potential of DCKV should not be overlooked, as it can further reduce the energy consumption of the VAC system by approximately 15 % based on airflow optimization. 3.3.2.2 Energy consumption of typical day in winter The high heat dissipation of commercial kitchen equipment increases the cooling load in summer and reduces the heat load in winter. For instance, on a typical winter day in Shanghai, observed on January 15, outdoor design air dry and wet bulb temperatures are recorded at -2.2 ℃ and -4.4 ℃ respectively. Fig. 13 shows the hourly energy consumption on such a typical winter day. Under the Constant Airflow operation strategy, fan energy consumption represents approximately 21% of the VAC system energy consumption, equivalent to approximately 21% of the total energy consumption of the commercial kitchen. Meanwhile, under the Airflow Optimization operation strategy, fan energy consumption accounts for approximately 35% of the VAC system energy consumption, constituting approximately 11% of the total energy consumption of the commercial kitchen. Lastly, under the Airflow Optimization + DCKV operation strategy, fan energy consumption makes up to 34% of the VAC system energy consumption, which translates to about 7% of the total energy consumption of a commercial kitchen. Comparatively, the total energy consumption of commercial kitchens in Shanghai during winter is lower than that on typical summer days, primarily due to decreased energy consumption of air-conditioning heating. Moreover, the total exhaust air volume and makeup air volume remained essentially constant between winter and summer, with fan energy consumption also showing consistency, albeit with a larger proportion. The distribution pattern of hourly energy consumption under each operating condition was consistent with that of the summer conditions. 3.3.2.3 Energy saving of typical day This section evaluates the energy savings of the three operation strategies based on the energy consumption components. The calculated energy consumption and energy-saving rates for each component in summer and winter are listed in Table 4 . The results showed that fan energy consumption was essentially the same in winter and summer because the airflow was determined by the pollutant control demand. The use of cookers, which is the main source of pollutants, was not affected by the season in this study. The energy consumption of the VAC system was lower in winter than in summer, and the heat dissipation of the cooker facilitated a reduction in the air conditioning cooling load in winter, leading to a reduction in the total energy consumption of the commercial kitchen. The airflow optimization strategy resulted in energy reductions of more than 20 % for fans and approximately 50% for the VAC system, with similar energy savings observed in summer and winter. DCKV can further reduce the energy consumption of fans by about 30% and VAC systems by approximately 20%. For the overall kitchen energy consumption, the optimal operation strategy resulted in commercial kitchen energy savings of 18.86% and 14.76% on typical summer and winter days, respectively, compared to the conventional constant airflow strategy. This shows that the air conditioning component within the VAC system holds the highest potential for energy savings, highlighting the importance of implementing personalized conditioned air within the workspace. Airflow optimization contributes to decreased exhaust and makeup air volumes, resulting in overall kitchen energy savings of > 10%. Additionally, DCKV facilitates airflow adjustments according to the actual usage of the cookers, leading to further overall kitchen energy saving of > 3%. 3.3.3 Annual energy consumption and energy saving The energy consumption analysis for a typical day reflects the hourly energy consumption pattern but lacks comprehensive feedback of commercial kitchens\u2019 energy consumption throughout the year. To address this gap, our study simulated the kitchen model\u2019s energy consumption across all seasons, utilizing meteorological parameters outlined in the Thermal Design Code for Civil Buildings (GB 50176\u20132016) [44]. The composition of annual energy consumption for commercial kitchens under different operating strategies is shown in Fig. 14 . In this visual representation, the entire circular area represents the total energy consumption of the commercial kitchen (100%). The raised fan represents the share of energy consumption of the VAC system, with proportional values indicated on the left. The grey part represents the total energy consumption of systems other than the VAC system within a commercial kitchen. The raised sector contains three panels arranged from the inside to the outside in green, blue, and red, representing the share of fan, cooling, and heating energy consumption, respectively, in the total energy consumption of the VAC system. The height and width of the panels reflect the size of the share, corresponding to the percentage value on the right side of the panel. As shown in Fig. 14, the energy consumption of the three parts of the VAC system was relatively uniform, with each part\u2019s energy consumption proportion varying within the range of 20% to 48% across the three operation strategies. The annual energy consumption and energy savings for different operation strategies are listed in Table 5 . The building energy densities of commercial kitchen cooling were 565 kW·h/(m2·a), 232 kW·h/(m2·a) and 129 kW·h/(m2·a) for the three operation strategies, respectively. In related literature [37], the average building energy density of 14 commercial kitchens in the UK for electricity consumption research was 232 kW·h/(m2·a). The energy-consumption simulation results were consistent with the research results (the commercial kitchen cooker power in this study being three times the average of the cookers in this study). The energy-consumption simulation results were consistent with the research results, considering that the commercial kitchen cooker power in this study was three times higher than the average of the cookers in this study. The energy savings of the VAC system under the airflow optimization and airflow optimization + DCKV strategies exceeded 50% and 70%, respectively, while the overall energy savings of the kitchen exceeded 10% and 14%, respectively. 3.4 Limitations and further research directions This paper analyzes objective thermal environment indicators for commercial kitchens in summer and winter. However, for commercial kitchens with strong asymmetric radiation, the actual thermal comfort should be analyzed by a combination of subjective evaluation and objective indicators to be more convincing. Thermal comfort questionnaires should be distributed to on-site staff to design more effective ventilation and air conditioning systems. 4 Conclusions The main conclusions obtained are as follows. (1) The demand exhaust rate of the cooker can be considered synonymous with the demand exhaust rate of the fume hood when multiple cookers are in operation, and optimizing the demand exhaust rate can be led to a 20% reduction in energy consumption by optimizing the airflow organization. (2) Under the working conditions examined in this study, the most effective air conditioning set up in both summer and winter comprises a combination of post conditioned air and ceiling fresh air. During summer, the conditioned air volume constitutes 30% of the total make-up air volume, with a supply air temperature of 22 ℃. In winter, the conditioned air volume increases to 40% of the total make-up air volume, with a supply air temperature maintained at 14 ℃. (3) The hourly energy consumption of the commercial kitchen throughout the day is related to the operating dynamics of the cooker. At its maximum power output, the cooker triggers the corresponding ventilation and air-conditioning system to consume the highest amount of energy, resulting in the peak energy consumption for the kitchen. (4) The energy-saving potential in the cooling and heating parts of commercial kitchens surpassed that of fans. Utilizing personalized air-supply air conditioning to improve the local thermal environment in work areas proves advantageous, leading to notable reductions in the energy consumption of the VAC system (the energy-saving rates of airflow optimization and DCKV were 51% and 71%, respectively), and the total energy consumption of the kitchen (the energy-saving rates of airflow optimization and DCKV were 10% and 15%, respectively).

        "dc:description": "To analyze the energy-saving potential of commercial kitchen ventilation and air-conditioning (VAC) systems and to create a good kitchen environment, this paper calculates the key influential parameters of the exhaust air volume and air supply temperature through CFD simulation. The former depends on the fume control effect and is closely related to the make-up air method, while the latter is governed by the thermal comfort. The energy consumption under different operational strategies is calculated using EnergyPlus. The following conclusions were obtained: (1) By summing the demand exhaust rate of the cookers with that of the fume hoods during the operation of multiple cookers, the pollution control effect can still be satisfied. Moreover, the airflow can be reduced by 20% through airflow optimization. (2) During summer, the conditioned airflow should constitute 30% of the total make-up air volume, with an air supply temperature of 22 ℃. Conversely, in winter, the conditioned airflow should comprise 40% of the total make-up air volume, with an air supply temperature of 14 ℃. (3) It is advisable to use a personalized conditioned air supply to create a local thermal environment, effectively reducing the energy consumption of ventilation and air conditioning systems. The energy-saving rates achieved through airflow optimization and on-demand ventilation are 51% and 71%, respectively.",
