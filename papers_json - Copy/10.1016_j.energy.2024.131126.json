Handling editor: Henrik Lund This paper presents a heuristic model predictive control (MPC) methodology to activate energy flexibility in fully electric school buildings in cold climates to reduce electricity demand during peak demand periods of the electric grid. To streamline the implementation of MPC, the proposed approach employs grey-box archetypes, a clustering of weather conditions to identify typical scenarios and a limited number of possible setpoint profiles. A data-driven grey-box approach is used to create archetype models for different thermal zones in a typical school building; this approach enables rapid development and requires much less calibration data than black-box models. A third-order resistance-capacitance thermal network for zones with convective heating and a fourth-order model for zones with radiant floor heating are developed and calibrated using measured data from an all-electric school building in Québec, Canada. The weather data are clustered into several categories, representing different weather conditions (6 clusters representing two ambient temperature ranges and three solar radiation ranges). The heuristic MPC strategy uses predefined optimal setpoint profiles for each cluster and weather prediction one day ahead to shift the building load from on-peak to off-peak hours. For each heuristic MPC scenario, the model runs a simulation using forecast weather data to quantify and activate energy flexibility in response to grid requirements. The developed MPC framework was implemented in the school used as the case study. Ten classrooms are investigated, with six using the MPC and four as a reference case with the reactive control system and default zone setpoint profiles. Results indicate that the school building can provide between 47% and 95% energy flexibility (load shifting relative to reference) during on-peak hours and up to 44% electricity cost reduction while satisfying acceptable temperature constraints. By implementing the proposed MPC, energy flexibility of 32 W/m2 of floor area for the zones with a convective heating system and 65 W/m2 of floor area for the zones with radiant heating can be achieved during a demand response event. The proposed strategy can be generalized and replicated in other school buildings.

Energy flexibility, defined as the capacity of the building to respond to the needs of the electric grid [1], is critical to addressing the grid's challenges of balancing supply and demand and integrating renewable energy sources [2,3]. To achieve these goals, it is necessary to develop control-oriented models able to provide reliable predictions, to be implemented in smart controllers, and generalizable in order to facilitate their widespread deployment in buildings [4,5]. Buildings are responsible for approximately 32% of the energy use worldwide, 17% of direct CO2 emissions, and 33% of indirect CO2 emissions [6]. Thus, building energy efficiency and ways to reduce CO2 emissions are of primary importance. Demand-side management (DSM) is considered one of the most effective ways to reduce peak electricity demand [7]. Demand-side management strategies can be classified into three categories: energy efficiency measures, demand response (DR), and energy flexibility [8,9]. Energy efficiency measures are characterized by reductions in energy consumption compared to a reference system or baseline. DR, an approach that curtails building electrical demand during grid on-peak hours, is a strategy for reducing electric loads in buildings without significant capital investment. Energy flexibility, in turn, is characterized by shifting energy demand profiles to satisfy grid and local objectives, including energy availability, cost management, and carbon emissions reduction [10]. In principle, it is typically executed in a planned and optimized manner [10,11]. Annex 67 of the International Energy Agency-Energy in Buildings and Communities Programme (IEA-EBC) defined energy-flexible buildings as those with \u201cthe ability to manage [their] demand and generation according to local climate conditions, user needs and grid requirements\u201d [12]. In smart electricity grids, buildings are increasingly recognized as flexible loads that can act as virtual energy generators [13], energy storage devices [14], and demand controllers [15]. Buildings with flexible electricity demand offer grid-responsive support, especially for large commercial and institutional (C&I) buildings [16]. A more effective approach to managing demand response programs allows operators to alleviate peak loads and maximize economic benefits [17,18]. Miri and McPherson [19] showed that using DSM could reduce residential billing costs by up to 15% in Alberta, Canada. Gallardo and Berardi [20] assessed the energy flexibility potential of a radiant ceiling panel with macro-encapsulated phase change materials (PCM) for cooling in a hot and humid climate. Their results confirmed the benefit of implementing DSM strategies to exploit the energy demand flexibility in an office building. School buildings represent a sizeable portion of the C&I building stock, which requires assessing their flexibility potential. Furthermore, school buildings provide a relevant example of the potential of other C&I buildings. Improving learning and teaching performance in schools requires higher indoor environmental quality (IEQ), which can significantly impact students' and teachers' health and well-being. However, HVAC systems are often far from optimal energy performance in school buildings [21]. Model predictive control (MPC) is one of the key approaches in activating energy flexibility in buildings to meet smart grid needs [22,23]. MPC allows the building operation to be programmed based on the weather forecast, expected schedules, and occupants' behavior. With MPC's proactive \"look ahead\" approach, the building operation can be optimized, activating energy flexibility while maintaining satisfactory indoor environmental quality. Liu et al. [24] developed a model predictive control method with a radiator heating system in residential buildings. Their results showed that a predictive controller performs better than a conventional controller in maintaining indoor temperature and can reduce energy consumption by 5.4%. Cotrufo et al. [25] described a methodology for implementing MPC in institutional buildings with dual-boiler systems. Their results showed a 22.2% reduction in natural gas consumption and a 4.3% reduction in heating demands. Zhao et al. [26] compared the operation of a radiation air conditioning system using MPC with conventional rule-based control of constant water temperature and PID control. Their results showed that the overall energy consumption is reduced by 14.9% compared to RBC and by 8.5% compared to the PID [26]. Wang et al. [27] proposed a clustering-based optimization method for regulating air conditioning system operation in office buildings. Results showed 17.98% and 35.49% energy savings in summer and winter, respectively. Chen et al. [28] developed an artificial neural network method combined with MPC to decrease energy cost and consumption in an office zone in Edinburgh, Scotland. Their results showed that energy consumption decreased by 26%, and the cost decreased by 28%. Wang et al. [29] compared the performance of reinforcement learning (RL) controlled and MPC in enhancing building energy efficiency and operational flexibility. Their results showed that the MPC controller performs superiorly due to its ability to make optimal decisions based on the system's current state and the predicted state. Gao et al. [30] presented a predictive controller joint with RL and compared it with deep reinforcement learning. Their results showed that the combined model can reduce operating costs by 14% and increase comfort performance by 88 %. Hu et al. [31] investigated the control of floor heating systems in the context of smart grids. Through a testbed simulation, their results demonstrated that the MPC controller effectively reduces peak energy demand and electricity costs for residential users. Elkadeem et al. [32] investigated an MPC framework for optimizing a large-scale grid-connected battery and battery-less hybrid solar/wind system in Egypt. Their results showed 22% energy cost and 46% greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction compared to the base case. Vallianos et al. [33] investigated data from around 7800 houses in Ontario and Québec, Canada, aiming to optimize MPC strategies for large-scale applications. They found that models with a 24-h calibration horizon, 7-day data length, and 15-min time intervals exhibit the best balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. Their results showed that applying MPC in residential buildings on a cold January day demonstrates a 15% reduction in peak power consumption for Ontario and 30% for Québec, enhancing both cost-effectiveness and thermal comfort. Wang et al. [34] explored using MPC in residential buildings to optimize air conditioner performance. Their results demonstrated that the MPC controller reduced cooling costs by 22.1% in the bedroom and 26.8% in the living room, outperforming traditional rule-based control. Sha et al. [35] proposed an adaptive MPC strategy for residential buildings. Their results indicated a 67% reduction in temperature deviation and a 20% decrease in energy consumption. Hua et al. [36] developed an MPC method in an office room with a water-circulated radiator heating and compared the results with a PID controller. They showed that using MPC could reduce energy consumption by about 3% and hot water flow change rate by 50%. Merema et al. [37] implemented an MPC controller for all-air systems in two lecture rooms in a school. Their results showed up to a 40% reduction in electric energy use. Although several studies have investigated the application of MPC in buildings, it is worth mentioning that most have focused on energy consumption in cooling-dominated regions. In cold regions where electricity is used for heating, electricity demand peaks in the morning and evening thus straining the electrical grid. For example, during winter, the electrical grid of Quebec (Canada) is heavily stressed by peak morning (6:00 to 9:00) and evening (16:00 to 20:00) loads [38]. It is thus essential to reduce peak demand for the grid by using the energy flexibility of building load [39,40]. Recent international efforts have recognized the need for a systematic approach to assess the flexibility for demand response in buildings [7,41,42]. The methodology of the present paper includes five steps. \u2022 Developing data-driven grey-box models for representative zones and calibration of these models with real data, \u2022 Clustering weather data based on the outdoor temperature and solar irradiance, \u2022 Creating predefined setpoint profiles for each weather cluster, \u2022 Testing of different control scenarios to assess the impact on electricity demand and energy performance, \u2022 Energy flexibility quantification to enable interaction between buildings, aggregators, and utilities. Following these steps, this paper presents an MPC methodology to control the HVAC system using the established dynamic tariffs for morning and evening peaks. Also, it demonstrates its potential to activate the energy flexibility of an occupied fully electric school building in a cold climate region. This clustering methodology to identify typical weather scenarios and room types and using predefined setpoint profiles is a practical approach that simplifies the implementation of MPC in real buildings while reducing the time and costs of modeling and optimization. Also, this methodology helps the utility to plan ahead based on the weather clusters while limiting the number of decisions. The approach presented here is scalable and can be transferable to other mid-size commercial buildings running on a schedule since the school is first conditioned based on the time of day and then on occupancy. Also, this approach can be used for schools located in cooling season or hot climates, by implementing a new price scheme and reducing peak load in on-peak hours during summer (around noon). 2 Methodology As shown in Fig. 1 ., the school building's zones are divided into the archetype zones with convective heating systems and zones with radiant heating systems. Then, archetype models for representative zones are developed. The input data, such as indoor temperature and power demand, are measured and collected. These data are used as inputs for the calibration of archetype data-driven grey-box models and parameter identification. Then, the weather data (e.g., outdoor temperature, solar radiation) are clustered into several categories, representing different weather conditions (6 clusters representing two ambient temperature ranges and three solar radiation ranges). Each clustering result corresponds to a predefined optimal setpoint temperature in the zones, which is determined through optimization in MPC. In the proposed methodology, the clustering process helps identify distinct groups of weather data used as input for RC model calibration. The developed MPC methodology uses predefined setpoint profiles of the HVAC systems as the decision variable to shift the building load from on-peak to off-peak hours. For each MPC scenario, the model runs a simulation to provide an optimal setpoint profile for the building and quantify energy flexibility in response to grid requirements. 2.1 Model creation 2.1.1 Data-driven grey-box model The challenges of generating an accurate and generalized model are one of the most significant limitations of MPC and have led to MPC largely being constrained to the research field to date [22,23,43]. Building energy models are typically categorized into three types: white box, black box, and grey box models. White-box models simulate the heating/cooling demand using physical principles, black-box models use data-driven models, and grey-box models use physical insight and real data. Data-driven grey-box models have been identified as a practical approach for addressing challenges associated with implementing MPC in intelligent buildings [44,45]. Selecting an appropriate level of resolution in a grey-box model is essential, as it directly impacts the tuning of the model parameters and, particularly, the calculation time of MPC. A high-order model containing too many parameters requires information that is not often available with adequate accuracy. An oversimplified model may not be accurate enough to be useful as a decision-making tool. Thus, model complexity should be chosen carefully considering the control objectives and constraints, such as the assessment of energy use and comfort criteria. In this paper, the thermal modelling approach is based on the lumped parameter explicit finite difference method. By performing a heat balance on the control volume, the differential equation of a node can then be written as [46]: (1) ∑ j U i j t ( T j t − T i t ) + ∑ k U i k t ( T k t − T i t ) − C i Δ t ( T i t + 1 − T i t ) + Q ˙ i t = 0 where. \u2022 U i j : Conductance between nodes i and j , W / K . \u2022 U i k : Conductance between nodes i and k where node k has a defined or known temperature, W / K . \u2022 T: is the temperature at node i or adjacent nodes, °C \u2022 Ci C ( T ) i : Capacitance of the node ( C = ρ C p A d x ) , J / K . \u2022 Q ˙ : Heat flow into the node, W . \u2022 Δ t : Time step, s Eq. (1) can be rearranged in the following explicit manner: (2) T i t + 1 = Δ t C i [ ∑ j U i j t ( T j t − T i t ) + ∑ j U i k t ( T k t − T i t ) + Q ˙ i t ] + T i t The capacitance of the air node contains a factor C T (air thermal capacitance multiplier) that accounts for phenomena (furniture and objects, the time required for air mixing, delay due to ducting, and other factors) that in a low-order model result in capacitance with an observed effective value significantly larger than the one calculated using only the physical properties of the air. The air thermal capacitance multiplier range between 6 and 10 [47]. Eq. (2) in matrix form is: (3) { T 1 ⋮ T N } t + 1 = { Δ t C 1 ⋮ Δ t C N } ⊙ ( [ − ∑ j N U 1 j − ∑ k M U 1 k + C 1 Δ t U 12 \u2026 U 1 N ⋮ ⋮ ⋱ ⋮ U N 1 U N 2 \u2026 − ∑ j N U N j − ∑ k M U N k + C N Δ t ] { T 1 ⋮ T N } t + { Q ˙ 1 + ∑ k M ( U 1 k k T k k ) ⋮ Q ˙ N + ∑ k M ( U N k k T k k ) } ) where. \u2022 ⊙ : is an element-wise multiplication operator. \u2022 N : is the number of nodes. \u2022 M : is the number of nodes with known temperatures. With this methodology, it is possible to create low-order resistance-capacitance (RC) thermal networks based on electrical-thermal analogies. Fig. 2 shows a third-order RC thermal network with three capacitances for the zones with convective heating, and Fig. 3 presents a fourth-order RC thermal network for zones with radiant heating system. The details of selecting the order of models and their validation are presented in a previous paper by the authors of this paper [48]. The results we presented in Ref. [48] showed that a first-order or second-order model cannot capture the system's dynamics with adequate accuracy. In these thermal network models, R indicates the lumped thermal resistance between the connected temperature nodes; C represents the lumped capacitance of the nodes, and Q represents the heat addition to the nodes. Table 1 provides an overview of thermal network parameters and their description. The RC models and calibration specifics have been discussed in detail in Ref. [49]. Model identification is the process of determining the physical properties of unknown systems according to some experimental data or training data. The objective of the optimization algorithm is to find the equivalent RC circuit parameters by minimizing the root mean square error (RMSE). The developed models are calibrated using the measured data. The important parameters (resistances and capacitances) are identified using the Sequential Least Squares Programming (SLSQP) in Python programming language. Eq. (4) [50] is used to calculate RMSE where T i , T ˆ i , and n represent the measurements data, simulation results, and total number of observations, respectively. (4) R M S E ( T , T ˆ ) = ∑ i = 1 n ( T i − T ˆ i ) 2 n The RC models are calibrated with measured data in zones with convective heating systems (i.e., Classrooms) and zones with radiant floor systems (i.e., the gym and offices). For example, the performance of the third-order RC model is validated with measured data and presented in Fig. 4 . The calibration results showed that the model for the zones with convective system had a RMSE of 0.4 °C and the model for the zones with radiant floor heating system had a RMSE of 0.6 °C. It is worth mentioning that higher-order models (which could potentially achieve a higher accuracy level) would require additional input data (e.g. heat flux measurements), which are typically not available in buildings. Furthermore, low-order models, such as the ones depicted in Figs. 2 and 3 provide sufficient information for the creation of near-optimal setpoint profiles. 2.1.2 Data clustering as a simplification approach A conventional optimization approach has a high computational complexity when applied to all classrooms and for all weather conditions; this complexity hinders its practical implementation. Therefore, in this paper, we propose finding the optimal setpoint profiles for representative days and zones instead of performing a complex optimization for all conditions. To this end, we adopt a time-series clustering technique that determines the representative zones and weather conditions. The weather forecasts are divided into clear, partly cloudy, and overcast days using the k-means clustering technique in Python programming language. The clustering quality is assessed using the Silhouette index. Silhouette analysis is a method of interpretation and validation of consistency within data clusters. The silhouette index (ranging between +1 and −1) measures how similar an object is to its cluster (cohesion) compared to other clusters (separation). An average silhouette index of 1 indicates dense, well-separated clusters; negative values indicate incorrect grouping. A cluster with the maximum average silhouette (within a specific range) is considered optimal. The forecast weather data was obtained from the CanMETEO® program from Natural Resources Canada [51]. This approach is a pre-processing step for other models. 2.1.3 Model predictive control formulation Model predictive control is a method for controlling a system that incorporates a dynamic model, predictions of impending disturbances (e.g., weather), and a cost function that minimizes over time (e.g., electricity price). An illustration of the MPC strategy employed in this study is shown in Fig. 5 . The weather forecast over the prediction horizon is used to solve the optimal control problem in MPC. The prediction horizon ranges from a few hours to a few days of generally accurate information about the future. The prediction horizon period is used to solve an optimization routine. The overall MPC framework is presented in Eq. (5) [23], where some sections describe the system dynamics for control, and others establish boundary conditions. A general optimal MPC formulation is given as follows: Objective : min u 0 , \u2026 , u N − 1 ∑ i = 1 N l ( x i , u i , w i ) .(5) Subject to h ( x i , u i , w i ) = 0 g ( ( x i , u i , w i ) ≥ 0 x 1 = x , Current state x i + 1 = f ( x i , u i , w i ) = A x i + B u i + E w i , System dynamics where. \u2022 x i: State variables describe the current state of the system, \u2022 u i: controllable input variables (such as heating setpoints) that can be changed to enhance the building's performance, \u2022 w i: Uncontrollable inputs (\u201cdisturbances\u201d) such as weather (outside temperature, solar radiation), \u2022 l (x, u, w): cost function, \u2022 h (x, u, w) = 0: equality constraints, \u2022 g (x, u, w) ≥ 0: inequality constraints (boundary conditions). The literature on optimization prefers convex models and constraints to ensure quick and reliable convergence to a global minimum. This paper uses state-space representations with convex cost functions, models, and constraints to formulate a convex optimization problem. In Quebec, the operating cost includes the price of the peak energy demand, which can be represented as a 1-norm within a convex prediction horizon. Hence, MPC is implemented in Python using routine CVXPy [52], a convex optimizer that is solved using ECOS [53]. The two key simplifications in this methodology are: (a) a clustering approach is used to identify typical weather scenarios and room types and (b) predefined optimal setpoint profiles for each cluster are considered to facilitate implementation of MPC in real buildings. Eq. (6) shows the optimization problem, where the objective is to minimize the electricity cost based on weather data clusters and predefined setpoint profiles. For each MPC scenario, the model runs a simulation using one day ahead forecast weather data to quantify and activate energy flexibility in response to grid requirements. In Eq. (6), the energy cost varies over the day, indicated by sub-index i, with higher prices during peak hours. Objective : min J .(6) W here : J = ( ( ∑ i = 1 N P i Δ t ) ∙ ( C o s t Energy , i ) + max ( P i ) ∙ ( C o s t Demand , i ) ) Subject to T s p ∈ [ T s p , 1 , T s p , 2 , \u2026 , T s p , n ] 0 ≤ P ≤ P max T _ ≤ T i n ≤ T \u203e where P i is the power demand at the time, N is the number of time steps across the prediction horizon PH, and Δt is the time step. The objective is to determine the room setpoint temperature profile (T sp) from predefined setpoint profiles (one for each weather cluster) that reduce the energy cost of the based on the heuristic optimization. Table 2 presents an overview of how each predefined setpoint temperature corresponds to each combination of solar irradiance and outdoor air temperature. The space heating demand (P) is limited by the maximum capacity of the heating equipment (P max), and the interior zone temperature T in needs to be kept within the allowable limits for comfort. 2.1.4 Electricity rates for medium-power demand buildings This study focuses on the electricity rates called Rate M and Rate Flex M, applied to the medium-sized commercial building and institutional sector in Quebec [54]. These rates are summarized in Table 3 . When the maximum power demand during a consumption period included in the last 12 months exceeds 50 kW, then Rate M applies to the contract. The rate consists of a demand charge and two energy prices: one for the first 210,000 kWh and another for any remaining energy use. Under Rate Flex M, the cost of electricity is cheaper than Rate M most of the time. However, during peak demand events, electricity is billed at a much higher price (51.97 ¢/kWh). Thus, shifting electricity use or limiting it is necessary to reduce costs. The day before a peak demand event, customers will receive a notification. Peak demand events can occur any day of the week from December 1 to March 31, from 6 to 9 a.m. and 4\u20138 p.m. The Rate M (base rate) price is applied for the rest of the year. 2.2 Case study The MPC technique is demonstrated in a 5200 m2 fully electric elementary school, located near Montréal, Canada (Figs. 6 and 7 ). Figs. 8 and 9 depict the two-storey school building with twenty classrooms, five offices, one gym, a kindergarten, a kitchen, and a meeting room. The schematic of the building's heating systems is shown in Fig. 10 . A geothermal water-water heat pump can provide up to 24 kW of heating (used for a radiant floor heating system and fan coils located at the school's entrance). Furthermore, 36 water-air heat pumps located in the ceiling of the spaces can deliver up to 182 kW of heating. Finally, a high-temperature electrically-heated thermal storage device can store over 600 kWh of heating, which can be delivered at a maximum rate of 80 kW for at least 1 h. Proportional-integral controllers (PI) control the air temperature in the reference zones with a convective heating system. Since heating systems are all electrical appliances, they are connected to the electrical grid. Predictive controllers can use this connection to balance electricity supply and demand. A dedicated electrical submeter and building automation system (BAS) provides high-quality data with a 15-min sampling interval. T-type thermocouples are used with an accuracy of 0.2 °C for a temperature range of 0\u201370 °C. Table 4 presents some of the characteristics of the school building. A schematic of the HVAC system in one of the school's classrooms is shown in Fig. 11 . The air handling unit used in this school is a centralized dual-core heat recovery system modulated based on CO2 level that provides preheated fresh air to all zones. The geothermal system has 28 loops with a depth of 100 m, providing nearly constant temperature for the heating system. The energy storage unit converts electrical power to stored heat during off-peak hours and provides heat to the building during peak demand. All classrooms are equipped with water-air heat pumps, which use the preheated water from the geothermal system and the electrical thermal storage unit (when it is in operation). The warm air is then distributed through ducts from the ceiling into the classrooms. One of the main challenges for conducting the experiment was that the school BAS programs the default thermostat schedule, but an end-user (e.g., teachers) could override it by changing the setpoint in the classroom's local control panel. To address this issue, access to override the indoor temperature was restricted by obtaining permission from the school board during the experiment. This restriction ensures that the experiments are conducted under controlled conditions and minimizes potential disruptions to the control strategies. Another significant challenge arose from gaps in measured data and missing information in the school case study. School buildings usually have a complex HVAC system and numerous sensors are needed to measure required data for modelling accurately. These systems' complexity necessitates installing numerous sensors to capture a comprehensive set of data essential for accurate modeling. However, the real-world scenario often presents challenges such as calibration issues or data transmission errors, leading to gaps in the dataset. Additionally, obtaining detailed information about the HVAC system's design, operation, and maintenance proved challenging due to privacy concerns, proprietary technology, or lack of documentation. To address these challenges, linear interpolation and backfilling techniques were used to estimate missing data points based on available information. Moreover, changing the setpoint temperature in an elementary school building presents a unique set of challenges that require careful consideration to balance thermal comfort, energy efficiency, and the well-being of children. Therefore, at all points we had continuous communication and collaboration with the school facility managers to ensure that any adjustments to the setpoint temperature would be implemented thoughtfully without violating the thermal comfort of occupants. 3 Simulation results: heuristic MPC in zones with convective heating system 3.1 Weather clustering The coldest months of the year in Montreal (January and February) are selected because this is when peak energy demand occurs. The solar irradiance (SI) and outdoor temperature data are clustered using k-means clustering method. The closest match with the centroids is then identified using this model. According to the average Silhouette index, the optimal number of clusters is three for solar radiation and two for outside temperature, as shown in Figs. 12 and 13 . Outdoor air temperature is clustered into two clusters (which is the highest average silhouette index) with an average temperature of −2.5 °C and −12.5 °C with a range of ±5 °C. In this way, most outdoor air temperature conditions are assigned to a cluster. Solar irradiance is clustered in three clusters (the highest average silhouette index) to distinguish between cloudy, semi-cloudy, and sunny days. This way, we can classify possible weather conditions into six groups (2 x 3) and plan one day ahead based on a combination of outdoor air temperature and solar irradiance conditions, as shown in Table 5 . Table 5 presents forecast scenarios according to the clustered outdoor temperature and solar irradiance. This methodology makes it possible to calibrate archetype RC thermal networks for representative clusters. Such a clustering-based approach enables the development of archetype control-oriented models for decision-making while reducing the number of choices/decisions, thus avoiding the high computational time and costs of modelling and optimization. 3.2 Energy flexibility assessment: predefined 6:00 a.m. event A Building Energy Flexibility Index (BEFI) has been proposed to quantify the energy flexibility of the building [55]. A description of the concept of the BEFI is presented in Appendix A. Using outdoor air temperature and solar radiation as inputs, these benchmarking models predict daily power demand. The Six predefined profiles (shown in Fig. 14 ) were tested on different clusters of weather forecasts (presented in Table 3). Figs. 15a and 16 a present indoor air setpoint temperature and the power demand for classrooms under business-as-usual (BAU) control to evaluate the peak load reduction due to heuristic MPC implementation. For example, Figs. 15b and 16b show the power demand under a 4-h transition ramp in setpoint temperature during very cold and cold days. For very cold days (OAT = −12.5 °C), simulations show that a lower night set-back value is advantageous to prevent peak load rise during on-peak hours. Building heating demand can be switched from peak to off-peak hours using a nearly flat set point (nighttime). Additionally, MPC increased thermal comfort for occupants by gradually raising the internal temperature at night rather than abruptly changing the set point right before occupancy began. As shown in Fig. 17 , applying a 4-h ramp during on-peak hours results in a positive BEFI (33 kW), indicating power reduction compared to the reference case. The BEFI is negative during off-peak hours (2:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m.), meaning a higher power demand to preheat the zones. Fig. 17 shows that 66 W/m2 of floor area of energy flexibility can be provided to the grid during morning on-peak hours. 3.3 Energy flexibility assessment: contingency reserve The term \u201ccontingency reserve\u201d refers to the ability of buildings to either reduce their electrical load or provide additional power back to the grid in situations where the power balance between supply and demand is disrupted (e.g., due to a power outage). This concept is part of energy flexibility, where buildings actively participate in the energy system to support grid stability and efficiency. In this paper, the first objective is to study the dynamic response of the classrooms to a downward temperature step change during on-peak hours of a very cold day while maintaining adequate comfort. Figs. 18 and 19 present setpoint temperature, room air temperature, power demand, and price signal for the reference and \u201cflexible\u201d scenarios, respectively. Fig. 20 shows that significant peak reduction can be achieved by replacing a step change with a simple 1, 2, or 3-h ramp. The results presented in Fig. 20 show that by increasing the ramp in temperature setpoint from 1 h to 3 h, the rebound power decreases by around 50%, which causes the peak values of efficiency. The total BEFI provided to the grid without a ramp and 3 h ramp after the flexibility event in the morning are shown in Figs. 21 and 22 , respectively. The results show that the BEFI is positive during peak hours by applying the proposed setpoint profiles, making power available for the grid. During off-peak hours (after DR events), the BEFI is negative, which shows higher power demand due to the power rebound for the classrooms. An energy flexibility of 11 kW in the morning and 8 kW in the evening can be achieved when the grid needs. Using the developed control strategies, achieving up to a 35% reduction in peak power demand during peak-demand periods while maintaining acceptable comfort levels is possible. According to Fig. 22, using a ramp in setpoint temperature has an important effect on the potential energy flexibility. Results show that using a 3-h ramp after on-peak hours could reduce the negative BEFI (rebound power) by 63 % and thus reduce the rebound effect. This action is essential for the stability and balance of the grid. 4 Simulation results: heuristic MPC in zones with radiant floor heating Radiant floor systems integrate high thermal inertia into the heating/cooling system and can be used to peak-shave and load-shift the building's thermal load. This section proposes near-optimal setpoint profiles for zones with radiant floor systems to increase energy flexibility while considering thermal comfort constraints. The maximum heating output is limited to the size of the system, which is 16 kW. To preheat the slab, four predefined control strategies are considered: preheating the slab at 20, 22, 24, and 26 °C from 12:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m. on both day clusters. Then, the slab temperature was reduced to 18 °C during the daytime (from 6:00 to 17:00) to discharge the slab. During unoccupied hours from 18:00 to 24:00, the setpoint temperature is raised to 22 °C to charge the slab again. Applying these predefined setpoint strategies shifts the power demand from on-peak hours to off-peak hours. Figs. 23b and 24 b show the power demand on very cold and cold days, respectively, when the slab is preheated at 22 °C during unoccupied times. It is beneficial to have a higher night set-back value when the outdoor air temperature is very low (for example, OAT = −15 °C) to avoid peak load during on-peak hours. It should be considered that using a high night set-back value of 26 °C on cold days (for example, OAT = −2 °C) paves the need for higher energy consumption and increases the risk of overheating during daytime. 4.1 Energy flexibility in zones with radiant floor system This section calculates such a BEFI to quantify the real-time thermal load flexibility of the building. Equations B.1 \u2013 B.3 (presented in Appendix B) calculate BEFI by implementing the flexibility strategy and comparing it with the reference case. The average BEFI per unit area in hourly intervals in zones with radiant hydronic floor and convective heating system is shown in Fig. 25 for a very cold sunny day (OAT = −12.5 °C) and Fig. 26 for a cold cloudy day (OAT = −2 °C). Both preheating options at 24 °C and 26 °C yielded favorable results, with an average BEFI of up to 9 kW (65 W/m2) for 3 h. The BEFI values are highest in the early morning because the abrupt switch from night setback to daytime temperature results in the most considerable reduction in peak demand. The potential power reduction can significantly (45%) downsize the heating systems. A BEFI of around zero shows that flexibility is not available from the building to the grid. 5 Field implementation results The developed MPC methodology was implemented through BACnet [56] in the case study building to test its actual performance. Ten classrooms are investigated, including five on the first floor and five on the second floor, with different orientations (as much as possible). Four classrooms are considered as the reference cases (Blue highlights in Fig. 27 ), and six are the flexible cases using MPC (Yellow highlights in Fig. 27). In this way, we could compare the results of the flexible case with the business-as-usual one. Each classroom is 9 m × 7 m × 3.5 m with a floor area of 63 m2. By including classrooms on both floors with varying orientations, we aimed to capture various thermal conditions and evaluate the MPC in different scenarios. Table 6 presents each classroom's control strategy, location, and installed heating capacity. Each classroom has a smart controller panel to adjust the temperature and lighting level and monitor CO2 ppm, relative humidity, and energy consumption. The school's design incorporates energy-efficient LED lighting and motion sensors to reduce energy consumption further when classrooms are unoccupied. The whole system is closely monitored with sensors. Thermostat and power meter data were collected at 15-min intervals in CopperCube, an on-site trend log archiver, through the BACnet network. These datasets include setpoint temperature, indoor temperature, CO2 level, air and water flow rate, and electricity power of HVAC systems. The school BAS programs the default thermostat schedule, but an end-user (e.g., teachers) can override it by changing the setpoint. It should be noted that during the experiment, access to override the indoor temperature is restricted by obtaining permission from the school board. This restriction ensures that the experiments are conducted under controlled conditions and minimizes potential disruptions to the control strategies. The historical weather data were obtained from the SIMEB (Simulation Energétique Des Bâtiments) website [57], which offers a variety of weather-related data, including hourly readings of the outdoor temperature and global horizontal irradiance from multiple Québec weather stations. These data were interpolated to a duration of 15 min using linear interpolation for the outdoor temperature and backfilling for the solar irradiance. The forecast weather data was obtained from the CanMETEO® program [51], which employs the numerical weather predictions of the Canadian meteorological service (Environment Canada). In an MPC framework, enforcing a specific temperature range is a common way to achieve thermal comfort. Fig. 28 presents the set point temperature for the classrooms. The indoor zone temperature is constrained by a lower bound, which is 18 °C at night and 21 °C during the day, and an upper bound, which is 27 °C at night and 24 °C during the day, in order to maintain a level of thermal comfort for the zone occupants. The upper bound generates the desired setpoint target to minimize the energy cost through load shifting by considering future weather and utility price signals. A lower bound constrains the minimum indoor temperature to maintain thermal comfort in the zone. To consider a case of a morning peak under a time-of-use tariff structure, the energy cost between 6:00 and 9:00 a.m. was increased by a factor of 15 (same as electricity price). Fig. 28 shows the classrooms to start being heated around 2:30 a.m. until heating is completely shut off at 6 a.m. The over-heated space can free float during the peak period and remain within the comfort boundaries. If there is an evening peak from 4:00 to 8:00 p.m., the evening behavior is affected by a slight preheating but not as aggressively as in the morning. As an example of results, Figs. 29 and 30 show power demand and average BEFI for two of the tested classrooms on a sunny cold day in winter with an average outdoor temperature of −10 °C (reaching −16 °C in the early morning). Fig. 29 presents the results for south-facing classrooms located on the first floor (i.e., class 143 as the flexible case and class 140 as the reference case), and Fig. 30 shows the results for north-facing classrooms on the second floor (i.e., class 209 as the flexible case and class 215 as the reference case). The results show that the power demand during on-peak hours is reduced by 1.65 kW in the classroom on the first floor and 0.95 kW in the classroom on the second floor. Thus, the average energy flexibility has increased between 58% and 95%. One reason for the different available flexibility is that each classroom has an individual heat pump controlled by a separate PI controller. Thus, heat pumps have various heating responses in each classroom, which results in different energy flexibility. Another observation is that the power demand after peak hours (i.e., after 9:00 a.m.) is higher in the north-facing classroom. This could be due to the solar radiation effect in the south-facing zones. Table 6 presents the average BEFI (kW) and percentage of BEFI (%) during the morning effect in flexible classrooms with MPC. These results are obtained by comparing the power demand with their adjacent classrooms as reference cases (refer to Fig. 26). In the case of class 226, the adjacent classrooms have not been appropriately measured. Therefore, for this classroom, class 215 is considered as the reference case. As shown in Table 7 , by applying the developed MPC in the school, the average BEFI of between 0.8 kW and 1.65 kW and the average energy flexibility of 47 %\u201395 % could be achieved. MPC was able to lower the price of electricity in the school. The daily electricity cost in the reference case (without MPC) ranged from $62.4 to $79.4, with an average of $70.9. It was lowered by the MPC controllers to a range of $28.2 to $51.2 and an average of $39.7, which is 44% average cost savings. The price reduction was achieved by successfully shifting the load from on-peak to off-peak periods. The proposed control methodology builds upon data-driven models and enhances school buildings' energy flexibility. Nonetheless, it was built to be scalable to similar mid-size school and commercial buildings. Moreover, it would facilitate the integration of school buildings in the future smart grid by adjusting the objective function in the optimization routine (e.g., peak demand, energy costs, and carbon intensity). Other new challenges for the grid, such as the integration of renewable energy sources and resiliency, could also be tackled with such a predictive control approach. 6 Limitations and future work The experimental test results have shown that fully-electric schools can serve as valuable resources for providing energy flexibility to the grid, and the proposed MPC can be one of the enabling technologies. However, several limitations still exist, particularly in the renewable energy retrofit, occupancy modelling, thermal comfort assessment, and GHG emission quantification. Further work is required to address these limitations and enhance the performance of the MPC system for fully-electric schools. \u2022 Renewable energy retrofit in existing school buildings: Many students live in remote and rural areas around the world without access to electricity grids, lots of new schools need to be built soon, and old ones need renovation, but not many in-depth studies have been performed on integrating the PV systems in school buildings. \u2022 Occupancy Modeling: Integrate occupancy modeling into the developed methodology to account for the influence of building occupancy on energy flexibility and thermal comfort. \u2022 Stochastic Modeling: Incorporating stochasticity in parameter values and input variables would provide a better understanding of the impact and robustness of the proposed control strategies. \u2022 Thermal comfort assessment: We considered upper and lower bound for indoor air temperature to assure thermal comfort of the occupants because other measurements such as mean radiant temperature and air velocity for precise thermal comfort evaluation are usually unavailable in real buildings. However, future work should focus on a precise assessment of thermal comfort, such as Fanger model as indicated by thermal comfort standards: ASHRAE 55\u20132004 [58] and ISO 7730 [59]. In this regard, we plan to install O3® sensors [60] in the school building and assess energy flexibility and thermal comfort in more detail. The O3 sensor can measure mean radiant temperature, humidity, motion, sound, and light sensing in a single device. \u2022 GHG emission quantification: While this study did not consider GHG emission quantification, a comprehensive GHG emissions assessment is beneficial, necessitating a thorough life cycle analysis and accounting for indirect emissions. 7 Conclusion This paper has presented an MPC methodology based on data-driven grey-box models and weather data clustering in electrically heated school buildings. A k-means clustering algorithm was applied to the solar irradiance and outdoor temperature data. The weather data are clustered into several categories, representing different weather conditions (6 clusters representing two ambient temperature ranges and three solar radiation ranges). The clustering results were further implemented into data-driven grey-box models. A third-order resistance-capacitance network for zones with convection systems and a fourth-order model for radiant floor systems were developed and calibrated using measured data. The developed MPC framework was then implemented in an occupied school building near Montreal, Canada. Ten classrooms are investigated, with six using the MPC and four as reference cases. Results showed that using MPC energy flexibility of 32 W/m2 of floor area for the zones with a convective heating system and 65 W/m2 of floor area for the zones with radiant heating can be achieved during a demand response event. Moreover, using a 3-h ramp in setpoint temperature after peak hours could reduce the negative BEFI (rebound power) by 63%, which is essential for the stability and balance of the grid. According to the results, the school building can provide between 47% and 95% energy flexibility (load shifting relative to reference) during on-peak hours and up to 44% electricity cost reduction. The proposed approach is scalable and can be transferable to other commercial and institutional buildings based on the archetype zone concept and the selection of optimal setpoint profiles based on weather forecast clustering. Future work will investigate the implementation of the developed MPC methodology for a shorter prediction horizon (i.e., 3\u20136 h) based on predicted solar radiation and ambient temperature. In addition, occupancy modeling, thermal comfort and GHG emission assessment, and renewable energy retrofit could eventually be integrated into the developed methodology.

A heat balance on the control volume can be used to write the differential equation as Eq. A.1: (A.1) C i d T i d t = Q i + ∑ i j n ( T j − T i ) R i , j Each node's energy balance is solved using an explicit finite difference method. The discretization of the time derivative term is as follows: (A.2) C i d T i d t ≈ C i Δ T i Δ t = C i ( T i t + 1 − T i t ) Δ t Temporal discretization of Eq. A.1 can be rearranged in the following explicit manner: (A.3) T i t + 1 = T i t + Δ t C i [ ∑ j U i j t ( T j t − T i t ) + ∑ k U i k t ( T k t − T i t ) + Q ˙ i t ] where Q i is the heat source generation, T is the temperature, and C i is the thermal capacitance of a node, R i,j is the thermal resistance between nodes. Choosing the time step based on the stability criterion defined in Eq A.4 is essential to ensure numerical stability. (A.4) Δ t ≤ min ( C i ∑ U i j ) where for all the nodes i, the summation is performed for all nodes j connected to node i. A detailed description of the governing equations can be found in Ref. [61]. Appendix B Energy Flexibility Assessment A building's Energy Flexibility Index would help define its ability to vary its power consumption [62]. This paper quantifies energy flexibility using two key performance indicators (KPIs): Building Energy Flexibility Index (BEFI) and Rebound Power (P rb ). \u2022 BEFI: By implementing the flexibility strategy and comparing it to the reference as-usual profile, Eq. B.1 calculates the average energy flexibility. We described this index in detail in Ref. [55]. (B.1) B E F I \u203e ( t , D t ) = ∫ t t + D t P ref d t − ∫ t t + D t P flex d t D t The percentage BEFI is calculated by dividing the power difference by the reference power demand (Eq. B.2). (B.2) B E F I % = P ref − P Flex P ref × 100 \u2022 Rebound power: The power surge before or after the flexibility event, either positively or negatively, is called rebound power. The rebound power P rb is defined below: P rb = max | B E F I | (B.3) Domain : ( 0 , t ) and ( t + D t , P H ) The time range (0, t) indicates the extra power use before the demand response (DR) event, the range (t + Dt, PH) denotes the additional power use after the event until prediction horizon (PH). This information is important for the grid to ensure that the grid remains stable and balanced outside the DR period. Fig. B1 shows the estimated power and BEFI due to a flexible setpoint temperature in a school building. Fig. B.1 An example of expected change in power profile and average BEFI available to the grid due to a flexible setpoint temperature in a school building. Fig. B.1 This figure illustrates how by using flexible setpoint profiles, we can shift the power demand or reduce the power. Also, using Flexible power and reference power profile, we can predict the available energy flexibility of the building to the grid. References [1] X.

        "dc:description": "This paper presents a heuristic model predictive control (MPC) methodology to activate energy flexibility in fully electric school buildings in cold climates to reduce electricity demand during peak demand periods of the electric grid. To streamline the implementation of MPC, the proposed approach employs grey-box archetypes, a clustering of weather conditions to identify typical scenarios and a limited number of possible setpoint profiles. A data-driven grey-box approach is used to create archetype models for different thermal zones in a typical school building; this approach enables rapid development and requires much less calibration data than black-box models. A third-order resistance-capacitance thermal network for zones with convective heating and a fourth-order model for zones with radiant floor heating are developed and calibrated using measured data from an all-electric school building in Québec, Canada. The weather data are clustered into several categories, representing different weather conditions (6 clusters representing two ambient temperature ranges and three solar radiation ranges). The heuristic MPC strategy uses predefined optimal setpoint profiles for each cluster and weather prediction one day ahead to shift the building load from on-peak to off-peak hours. For each heuristic MPC scenario, the model runs a simulation using forecast weather data to quantify and activate energy flexibility in response to grid requirements. The developed MPC framework was implemented in the school used as the case study. Ten classrooms are investigated, with six using the MPC and four as a reference case with the reactive control system and default zone setpoint profiles. Results indicate that the school building can provide between 47% and 95% energy flexibility (load shifting relative to reference) during on-peak hours and up to 44% electricity cost reduction while satisfying acceptable temperature constraints. By implementing the proposed MPC, energy flexibility of 32 W/m2 of floor area for the zones with a convective heating system and 65 W/m2 of floor area for the zones with radiant heating can be achieved during a demand response event. The proposed strategy can be generalized and replicated in other school buildings.",
