Graphical abstract Real-time optimal control (RtOpt) is an efficient tool to improve the energy efficiency of heating, ventilating and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems. RtOpt is always centralized and solved entirely in building energy management systems (BEMSs). However, centralized optimization is not be an efficient solution because real-time operation data in local loops need to be sent to the central computation unit in BEMS for optimization. This paper, therefore, proposes a distributed RtOpt scheme for typical centralized HVAC systems, which uses a dual decomposition mechanism to break the centralized problem into one mater problem and several sub-problems that can be solved in parallel and independently. The mater problem is converted to a simple mean value calculation using a projected sub-gradient method, thus distributing the computation load from the central computation unit into local computation units. Unlike available decomposition schemes in literature, the proposed method considered the functionality and spatial distribution of the major components of HVAC systems, which could enhance the physical meaning and facilitate the application of the decomposition scheme. The proposed distributed RtOpt scheme was tested in case studies, with numerical analysis being used to demonstrate its potential benefits. Keywords Heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning system Real-time optimal control Distributed intelligence Computation efficiency Energy efficiency 1 Introduction The building sector accounts for more than 40% of total energy use worldwide [1]. With continuous urbanization building sector continues to grow, and this percentage is increasing [2]. It is well established that there is strong bidirectional relation between urbanization, energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission [3]. It is estimated that buildings are responsible for about 33% of GHG emissions. Therefore, one efficient way to reduce worldwide energy use and GHG emissions is to reduce building energy use. Within buildings, central heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems are responsible for about 50% of the total energy consumption [4]. Thus there is significant potential saving through the energy-efficient operation of these systems. Real-time optimal control (RtOpt) has been recognized as one such effective solution for improving the energy-efficient operation of HVAC systems, as described in the ASHRAE Handbook \u2013 HVAC Applications 2011 [5]. It regularly adjusts the control settings (such as set-points) of local loops or sub-systems to minimize the system's energy use or operating cost without sacrificing cooling supply [6,7]. Many studies have demonstrated that real-time optimal control can significantly improve the energy efficiency of these systems [8,9]. RtOpt of HVAC systems has been studied and developed for several decades [10,11]. In the 1990s, most studies investigated the optimal control design for local-loops or sub-systems of HVAC systems using classic quadratic programming or gradient-based methods [12,13]. More recently, RtOpt at the system level has been investigated. For instance, Lu et al. [14,15] used a genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize eight decision variables for an HVAC system. Interior point optimizer was developed in [16] for building-wide optimization, where model predictive control (MPC) was used with 144 degrees of freedom and 236 inequality constraints. Toub et al. [17] developed an MPC strategy for an HVAC system integrated with a micro-scale concentrated solar power system to optimize the energy cost of the system. Zhang and Turner [18] developed a simplified physical model for the optimization of a chiller plant using a wire to water concept. The decision variables in the optimization problem were condenser water supply temperature, chilled water supply temperature, and condenser water flow rate. An integrated MPC was developed to optimize HVAC systems and energy storage operation under thermal and operational constraints [19]. As pointed out by Kelly and Bushby [20], real-time optimal control has a \u201clong history with little real-world progress\u201d due to \u201cthe need to have information on the performance and status of all systems and equipment in one place and the difficulties in handling boundary conditions and discontinuous systems found in buildings\u201d. They concluded that \u201cwhile optimization was possible, it was computationally intensive and difficult to implement in real building systems.\u201d They recommended that one possible solution is \u201cto solve the problem of building system optimization in a 'distributed manner', which can avoid \u201dmany of the problems associated with optimization methods that require that information on the performance and status of all HVAC systems and equipment be available in one location (i.e., at the device doing the optimization).\u201c Inspired by this recommendation, distributed RtOpt has gained attention in recent years. For example, Cai et al. [21] and Jaramillo et al. [22] developed an agent-based distributed control framework and investigated its application in several HVAC systems in commercial buildings. They concluded that the agent-based distributed control could provide better performance and would be easier to implement for each sub-system if the information exchange of coupling between sub-systems were clearly defined, and each sub-system was shipped with an agent defining its complete dynamics. Wang et al. [23] developed an agent-based decentralized optimal control strategy for air-conditioning systems, where dedicated agents carried out optimization of only sub-systems, and global optimality was achieved using an evolutionary algorithm. A multi-agent-based distributed optimal control of multi-zone ventilation systems was developed to improve indoor air quality by regulating the operation of the primary air-handling units [24]. Previous studies are focused on the adaptation of multiple-agent systems (MASs) to the optimal control of HVAC systems by assuming that agents for individual components are already available, even for fans and dampers in Cai et al. [21] and valves and pumps in Jaramillo et al. [22]. However, in the current configuration of HVAC products, agents for HVAC components are not yet ready for application, and many components are not equipped (or will be equipped) with powerful computation units that are necessary to realize relatively complex computations. Thus, to promote distributed real-time optimal control, optimization decomposition needs to consider (1) the functions of HVAC components, (2) the spatial (physical) distribution of components, and (3) the economical distribution of local intelligence in HVAC components. Therefore, this study presents a distributed RtOpt method for a typical central HVAC system by taking into account these three factors, demonstrating that a typical HVAC system can be divided into three functional subsystems, namely cooling distribution (with the major components of air-handling units), cooling generation (chillers) and heat rejection (cooling towers). Accordingly, the centralized optimizaiton is decomposed into three sub-problems and a master problem using a dual decompostion mechamism. Each sub-problem is dedicated to a subsystem and solved using the corresponding local intelligence (computational units). The master problem is converted into a simple mean value calculation using a projected sub-gradient method and solved in the central computational unit (in BEMS). Different from the work of Li and Wang [24], in which only a ventilation system was considered, a whole HVAC system was investigated in this study, thus necessitating the distinguish of public and private variables in decomposition and presenting a holistic development of distributed optimal control for HVAC systems. Different from the work in Cai et al. [21] and Jaramillo et al. [22], where even constraints were considered as sub-problems, the decomposition's physical meaning used in this study was enhanced (only three sub-problems are formulated), thus facilitating the application of distributed optimization in HVAC engineering. This method is also different from the decomposition method developed by Ye and Chen [9], where a coordination variable (the evaporating temperature of chillers) was identified to decompose the centralized optimization of a HVAC system into two weakly coupled subsystems. Here, public variables were defined, which can completely allocate the independent sub-problems to their dedicated physical components. This paper first introduces a typical central air-conditioning system and the formulation of a centralized optimization problem for this system. Then, the proposed decomposition scheme for the centralized optimization is detailed, including the definition of sub-systems and the formulation of sub-problems for the distributed optimization. The performance models of the sub-systems presented by Hussain et al. in [25] are used in the optimization formulation. The proposed scheme was tested on a dynamic simulation platform built using TRNSYS simulation software. The algorithm of the distributed optimal control was coded in object-oriented programing using MATLAB and linked with the TRNSYS simulation platform. The performance was evaluated in the aspect of optimality of control solution, convergence speed and computational efficiency. Finally, case studies were carried out to realize the energy performance of the proposed method, comparing it with conventional approaches. 2 Methodology 2.1 System introduction The system studied is shown in Fig. 1 , which is a typical central HVAC system. It consists of three local control loops with their respective operating set-points. The first one is the supply air loop, responsible for the distribution of conditioned supply air to the zones. The supply air temperature T sa is manipulated to its set-point by adjusting the chilled water flow rate through a local controller inside the AHU, while the supply air flow rate is varied to deal with different cooling demand from the zone. The second one is the chilled water loop, responsible for cooling generation through chilled water supplied to air handling units (AHUs) via pumps. The chilled water supply temperature T chws is controlled to its set-point by adjusting the refrigerant flowrate inside the refrigeration cycle through an inherent controller inside the chiller. The third loop is the condenser water loop, rejecting heat from the condenser to the cooling water from cooling towers. Inside this loop, the condenser water return temperature T cws is controlled to a specified set-point by adjusting the fan speed inside the cooling tower through a fan speed controller. Generally, the set-points for T sa , T chws and T cws are kept as constants to ensure the system operation stability at variable load conditions. However, these set-points are found to significantly influence the energy performance of the HVAC systems, which provide the basis for real-time optimal control. In current products, cooling towers, chillers and air-handling units will likely be equipped with distributed intelligence, i.e. relatively powerful computation units, such as PLC or other control stations. Typically, cooling towers are grouped together and allocated on building roofs (outdoor) for facilitating heat rejection; chillers are grouped together and allocated on building roofs (indoor) for reducing noises or on ground floors for facilitating maintenance; while air-handling units could be allocated centrally in a mechanical room (small buildings) or individually at each floor to reduce air ducts and enhance the operational flexibility of air terminals (large buildings). 2.2 Formulation of the centralized real-time optimal control The centralized RtOpt is implemented in a building energy management system (BEMS) to regulate its operating set-points based on the current condition of the HVAC system and the weather, as illustrated in Fig. 2 . When the temperature set-points for the supply air, the chilled water supply and the condenser water return are set as decision variables for a given cooling load Q z , the real-time optimal control of the HVAC system can be formulated to minimize the total power of the systems, which has the form of (1) T sa ∗ , T chws ∗ , T cws ∗ = min T sa , T chws , T cws P tot where P tot is the total system power, the sum of the power consumed by all chillers, fans and pumps. P tot can be written as (2) P tot = P AHU , f + P ch , p 1 + P ch , p 2 + P ch + P ct , f + P ct , p The optimization is subject to the operational constraints on the decision variables given by (3a) T _ sa ≤ T sa ≤ T ¯ sa (3b) T _ chws ≤ T chws ≤ T ¯ chws (3c) T _ cws ≤ T cws ≤ T ¯ cws (3d) T z = T z , d e s where Eqs. (3a), (3b) and (3c) specify the feasible range for T sa , T chws and T cws ; and Eq. (3d) indicates that the zone temperature T z should be maintained at its desired value T z , d e s for thermal comfort. Note that (1) in this study T z is not directly shown in the models of the optimal control detailed in Appendix A, but it is a dominant variable in the estimation of the cooling load Q z ; and (2) the lower bound T _ cws for T cws should be specified according to weather conditions, i.e. T _ cws is normally set as T _ cws = T db + 2 oC, where T db is the dry bulb temperature. Since the power models of the HVAC system are nonlinear, the optimization in Eq. (1) is a nonlinear programming. It can be solved using genetic algorithms (GAs) or gradient-based optimization methods that can search for the optimal solutions in a multidimensional search space in a reasonable time. The optimal solution, i.e. optimal setting of decision variables, is then sent to the local-loop controllers for operation. 2.3 From centralized to distributed real-time optimal control To implement the distributed optimization technique, the centralized optimization problem in Eq. (1) should be decomposed into sub-problems that can be solved in parallel. There are many ways to decompose a centralized optimization problem [26]. In order to make the decomposition physically meaningful, each sub-problem is expected to be dedicated to a sub-system with a relatively independent function. Considering the functionality and spatial distribution of the major components and the current distribution of intelligence discussed in Section 2.1, this study suggests to divide the HVAC system into three sub-systems, namely the cooling distribution sub-system (SS1) that consists of AHUs, the cooling generation sub-system (SS2) that consists of chillers, and the heat rejection sub-system (SS3) that consists of cooling towers. Following this division, the total power model is rewritten as (4) P tot = P sub , 1 + P sub , 2 + P sub , 3 where P sub , 1 , P sub , 2 , P sub , 3 are the power of SS1, SS2 and SS3, respectively. According to Appendix A, P sub , 1 , P sub , 2 , P sub , 3 can be written as (5a) P sub , 1 = P AHU , f T sa + P ch , p 2 T sa (5b) P sub , 2 = P ch ( T sa , T chws , T cws ) (5c) P sub , 3 = P ct , f ( T chws , T cws ) It can be seen that these sub-systems are coupled with each other with respect to the decision variables. According to the decomposition theory (Boyd et al. 2008) [27], the information handled at the local device at each sub-system can be categorized into two categories; public variables that are copies of decision variables and are shared with the master problem to satisfy coupling constraints, and private variables that is the information processed and kept at each sub-system (i.e. not share with the master problem). The private variables for each sub-system are listed after the definition of sub-problems. It is important to note that due to the high couple between the HVAC sub-systems, there are no decision variables that fall in the category of private variables, i.e. all the decision variables ( T sa , T chws , T cws ) are public variables. Following the notations in (Boyd et al. 2008), y i is used as a vector that contains the public variables associated with the i-th sub-system and y i ( j ) the j-th (scalar) public variable in the i-th sub-system [27]. Then, Eqn. (4) can be reformulated as P tot = P sub , 1 ( y 1 ( 1 ) ) + P sub , 2 y 2 ( 1 ) , y 2 ( 2 ) , y 2 ( 3 ) + P sub , 3 y 3 ( 1 ) , y 3 ( 2 ) or in a compact form (6) P tot = P sub , 1 ( y 1 ) + P sub , 2 y 2 + P sub , 3 y 3 with the coupling constraints C coup , ρ , ρ = 1 , ⋯ , 3 between the sub-problems (7a) C coup , 1 : y 1 ( 1 ) = y 2 ( 1 ) = T sa (7b) C coup , 2 : y 2 ( 2 ) = y 3 ( 1 ) = T chws (7c) C coup , 3 : y 2 ( 3 ) = y 3 ( 2 ) = T cws Define z as the vector of the net variables as z = z 1 z 2 z 3 = T sa T chws T cws Define y as the vector of all public variables y = y 1 y 2 y 3 = y 1 ( 1 ) , y 2 ( 1 ) , y 2 ( 2 ) , y 2 ( 3 ) , y 3 ( 1 ) , y 3 ( 2 ) T Then, the coupling constraints are formulated as (8) y = E z where E is a matrix, defined as E = 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 When the dual decomposition is used, the Lagrangian for Eqn. (6) is defined as (9) L = P sub , 1 y 1 + P sub , 2 y 2 + P sub , 3 y 3 + v T y - E z where v is the Lagrange multiplier associated with y = E z , which has the form of v = v 1 v 2 v 3 = v 1 ( 1 ) , v 2 ( 1 ) , v 2 ( 2 ) , v 2 ( 3 ) , v 3 ( 1 ) , v 3 ( 2 ) T where v i is the subvector of v associated with the i-th sub-system and v i ( j ) the j-th (scalar) multiplier in v i With the above definitions, the minimization of P tot in Eqn. (6) subject to the constraints in Eqn. (7) can be written as [27] Sub-problem 1 : g 1 v 1 = min y 1 P sub , 1 y 1 + v 1 T y 1 subject to the constraint (3a), (3d) Sub-problem 2: g 2 v 2 = min y 2 P sub , 2 y 2 + v 2 T y 2 subject to the constraint (3a), (3b), (3c) Sub-problem 3: g 3 v 3 = min y 3 P sub , 3 y 3 + v 3 T y 3 subject to the constraint (3b), (3c) Master problem: max v g 1 v 1 + g 2 v 2 + g 3 v 3 subject to E T v = 0 Now the centralized optimization in Eqn. (1) with the constraints Eqns. (3a)-(3d) is decomposed into three sub-problems and a master problem, where the master problem aims to ensure the consensus convergence to the global optimality. Dual decomposition, with a projected sub-gradient method for the master problem, leads to an algorithm below: Algorithm 1: Algorithm to solve the distributed optimization At each optimization time, do \u2022 Initialize the vector v that satisfies E T v = 0 ; \u2022 Repeat (i) Solve the sub-problems (1\u20133) separately to obtain y 1 , y 2 , y 3 ; (ii) Computing the average of z by z ^ = ( E T E ) E T y ; (iii) Check if \u2016 y - E z ^ \u2016 2 < θ ; output by z ^ and stop the algorithm; otherwise, update v by v · v + α y - E z ̂ \u2020 and back to (i). where α is an appropriate step size and · \u2020 indicates the projection into the non-negative orthant. As illustrated in Algorithm 1, the step-by-step execution of distributed optimization involves iteratively solving the three steps for the convergence of public variables. In each optimization cycle, the sub-problems is solved separately and publish public variables, which is shown in Step (i). In Step (ii) the master problem calculates the average value of public decision variables over each net. In Step (iii) the master problem checks for the minimum threshold for convergence to terminate. If the threshold is reached, the master problem notifies the computation units to update the operating decision variables in the respective sub-systems. Else, the master problem updates the v vector and goes back to Step (i). Note sub-problems 2 and 3 still have three and two decision variables, respectively. In order to have a computationally efficient and reliable solution of sub-problems, the hybrid genetic algorithms (HGAs) method [28] was employed at the sub-systems level to search for the optimal solution. Given the limited computational power of local devices, the HGAs method was used since it uses the GAs for fast-global search. However, the GAs method cannot guarantee convergence in local search and can be time demanding [29]. Therefore, for local search quasi-Newton method [30] was used (using gradient-based optimization). The quasi-Newton method starts with the initial population of the GAs method, taking advantage of the GAs ability to perform a fast-global search and guarantee the convergence of the optimization problem with the quasi-Newton method. 2.4 Realization of the distributed real-time optimal control of HVAC systems The realization of the distributed RtOpt is illustrated in Fig. 3 . The sub-problem 1 is dedicated to the sub-system 1, the sub-problem 2 to the sub-system 2, and the sub-problem 3 to the sub-system 3. They can be solved independently from each other in parallel. To realize the parallel calculation, each sub-system needs to be equipped with a local computation unit. \u2022 Computational unit 1 is dedicated to Sub-system 1 to solve Sub-problem 1; \u2022 Computational unit 2 is dedicated to Sub-system 2 to solve Sub-problem 2; \u2022 Computational unit 3 is dedicated to Sub-system 3 to solve Sub-problem 3. Meanwhile, the master problem is still programmed at the BEMS to have a consensus between the computational units to ensure global optimality. When optimization is activated, the BEMS will initialize v and send v 1 , v 2 and v 3 to the local computation units. Then, the local computation units will solve the corresponding sub-problems to find y 1 , y 2 and y 3 and send them to the BEMS. Next, the BEMS will calculate z ^ and check whether the condition to terminate is satisfied. If no, v will be updated and sent the local computation units for another calculation round. When the termination condition is satisfied, the master problem notifies the local computation units to update the operating decision variables in their respective sub-systems. Thus, data exchange between the BEMS and the local systems is different from the centralized optimization shown in Fig. 2. The operation data for the real-time optimal control will not be sent to the BEMS. Note that the decomposition scheme in Fig. 3 is easier to be implemented in practice than the conceptual scheme in Cai et al. [21] and Jaramillo et al. [22], in which almost every component was considered as an agent to be involved in the optimization. This is because the proposed decomposition scheme requires only the major components, including AHU, chillers and cooling towers, to be equipment with local computational units. 3 Simulation platform 3.1 System description A large-scale central HVAC system suitable for a skyscraper or a large commercial building has been considered in this case study. The schematic of the HVAC system was introduced in Fig. 1. A dynamic simulation platform of this system was constructed in the TRNSYS environment since it is a reliable tool for the evaluation of optimal control schemes [31]. The optimal control schemes were programmed separately in MATLAB and linked with TRNSYS using component TYPE 155 to provide set-points for the local loop operation of each sub-system. The building HVAC system simulation platform constructed in the TRNSYS has a typical configuration with bypass line and chilled water flow rate at the secondary side was regulated to maintain the desired supply air set-point temperature, using a variable speed pump with a rated flow rate of 345\u202fl/s. The primary chilled water flow rate and condenser water flow rate were interlocked with constant speed pumps with a rated flow rate of 345\u202fl/s and 410\u202fl/s, respectively. To generate the cooling, three water-cooled chillers, each with a rated capacity of 7239\u202fkW, were used. To reject the heat from the chilled condenser, six crossflow cooling towers, each with a rated flowrate of 250\u202fl/s, were used. On the supply air side, one air-handling unit was adopted to simplify the operation. The sampling time of the simulation platform was 1\u202fmin. The validated and well-calibrated TRNSYS model of a mega grade A, 90-floor high building (with 24\u202fh round service) was used to generate the seasonal ambient condition and load profiles for the case study separately [32]. The configuration of the simulation platform is summarized in Table 1 . The chiller sequencing was used to determine the number of chillers needed to meet the load condition. The total cooling load-based sequencing was employed, using the calculated cooling load to the stage on or off a chiller. The cooling load was estimated with Eqn. (10), using the measured primary chilled water flow rate m ch , 1 and the difference between chilled water return T chwr and chilled water supply temperatures T chws . The cooling load was divided equally on the number of operating chillers, i.e. calculated by Eqn. (11), where c w is the specific heat of water, Q ch , r a t e d is the rated capacity of each chiller. The c e i l i n g ( ∙ ) function was used to round off to the nearest largest integer. (10) Q ch = c w m ch , 1 T chwr - T chws (11) K ch = c e i l i n g Q ch / Q ch , r a t e d The cooling tower sequencing was used to determine the number of cooling towers needed to reject the heat from chiller condensers. The number of cooling towers was calculated using the number of chillers from Eqn. (12) due to the coupling between the chiller and cooling tower. The number of cooling towers was given by (12) K ct = σ K ch where coefficient σ depends on the chiller's configuration. Proportional-integral (PI) controllers were used in the local loops through component TYPE 23 to maintain stability [33]. The optimal set-points generated by the optimal control schemes were sent to the sub-systems that ensure the stable performance of each sub-system. 3.2 Configuration of real-time optimal control The centralized RtOpt scheme was implemented for the HVAC system to validate the control accuracy of the proposed distributed RtOpt scheme and evaluate its energy performance. The centralized RtOpt scheme was set up as a global optimization problem with Eq. (1) as introduced in Section 2.2, where the total power use P tot , defined by Eq. (2) was used as the objective function since there is no significant thermal storage. The supply air temperature T sa , the chilled water supply temperature T chws , and the condenser water supply temperature T cws were used as the decision variables in the optimization problem. The optimization problem in Eq. (1) was subject to the operational constraints described by Eqs. (3a)\u2013(3d) with the parameters presented in Table 2 . The sub-system performance models are detailed in Appendix A. In order to have consistency, the HGAs method was used to search the solution of the optimization problem in Eq. (1). The optimization was carried out every 60\u202fmin in both the centralized RtOpt scheme and the distributed RtOpt scheme. In addition, the same set of operational constraints were used with the distributed RtOpt schemes. It should be noted that in both the centralized RtOpt and the distributed RtOpt, optimization should not be performed too frequently that can deteriorate the system stability since the local controls need time to stabilize at new set-points after set-point updating [37]. 4 Case studies and results 4.1 Optimization accuracy of the distributed real-time optimal control scheme The optimization accuracy is the optimality of the control solutions from an optimal control scheme, which is a standard criterion to evaluate the ability of the scheme to find optimal solutions. To evaluate the optimization accuracy of the proposed distributed RtOpt scheme, the solutions of the distributed RtOpt were compared with the centralized RtOpt scheme. The tests were conducted under three typical weather conditions: spring, summer, and autumn. Monte Carlo simulation was adopted to compare the optimization results from both strategies randomly. Random 10,000 samples of ambient conditions were selected for each weather season. Table 3 presents the range of the weather conditions for spring, summer, and autumn with respect to dry bulb temperature T db , wet bulb temperature T wb and cooling load Q for three seasons. The samples in the ambient condition data were solved with both optimal control schemes, and the total power optimization results were recorded. To analyze the optimization accuracy, regression plots for all three weather seasons are presented in Fig. 4 , comparing the distributed optimal control solution with the centralized optimal control. It can be seen that there is good agreement in results from the distributed RtOpt and the centralized RtOpt, suggesting the accuracy of optimization solution from distributed RtOpt scheme. To quantify the optimization accuracy of distributed RtOpt scheme, two performance matrixes were used: the coefficient of determination ( R 2 ) and the mean absolute percentage/deviation error (MAPE). R 2 was used to quantify the accuracy of optimization using Eqn. (13) and MAPE was used to realize the overall deviation in the performance. The results for all three seasons are presented in Table 4 . It can be seen the R 2 values were close to 1 for all three seasons suggesting high accuracy of optimization. The MAPE values are also very small for all three seasons indicating a small deviation in performance. (13) R 2 = 1 - ∑ r i - r ^ 2 ∑ r i - r ¯ 2 where r i is the actual value, r ^ is the estimated value, and r ¯ is the mean value, given by r ¯ = 1 n ∑ i = 1 n r i 4.2 Performance evaluation and discussion 4.2.1 Test weather conditions The proposed distributed RtOpt scheme was evaluated with respect to convergence speed, computational efficiency, and energy performance under three weather conditions: spring, summer and autumn, each with one week. The weather conditions and the cooling load for spring, summer and autumn were presented in Fig. 5 , generated from the well-calibrated building model of a mega grade (in Hong Kong). This is a 24\u202fh service building where financial companies from all over the world operate. The building services include air-conditioning, lift and security access, power use and so on. The TRNSYS model of the building was constructed in [] with validation through performance data (from October 1, 2009, to October 31, 2009) available from the actual building, including cooling load, occupancy level, and meteorological data. To generate further data for this study TRNSYS 16 TMY2 meteorology file of Hong Kong was used with the same occupancy. The average cooling load was 2905\u202fkW, 6562\u202fkW and 6018\u202fkW for spring, summer and autumn, respectively, while the maximum loads for the three seasons were 7348\u202fkW, 13,011\u202fkW and 12,635\u202fkW. 4.2.2 Computational performance analysis The convergence speed and computational efficiency were analyzed under the summer conditions. The iteration number required by Algorithm 1 for reaching consensus was analyzed because it was directly related to the overall computation time, and it is generally the main drawback of using the distributed scheme that it can require many iterations to reach consensus, whereas centralized RtOpt scheme only requires no such iteration to search the optimization solution. Fig. 6 illustrated the iteration numbers in each optimization, which showed that consensus could always be achieved within 10 iterations, although the maximum number was 17. This demonstrated that Algorithm 1 had a very high convergence speed, which might be due to the simple structure of the sub-systems models used to define computation units that are linear in nature with regards to independent variables that significantly reduce the computational complexity. The computational performance of the proposed distributed RtOpt scheme was analyzed and compared with that of the centralized RtOpt scheme. Fig. 7 (a) showed the time used by the distributed RtOpt scheme to update the Lagrange multiplier in the BEMS in one complete optimization, i.e. until the iterations were finished (refer to Algorithm 1). The time, averagely less than 0.01\u202fs, was insignificant compared with that used by the centralized RtOpt scheme, shown in Fig. 7(b). Thus, the computational load was successfully distributed to the local computational units. The computation time required by all three local computational units is shown in Fig. 8 . Due to the iterations, a long time was used by these local computational units when compared with the centralized RtOpt scheme. This might be due to the reason that the number of the decision variables was small. Furthermore, after decomposition, the searching dimension (for optimal solutions) was not significantly reduced (in Sub-problem 2, the searching dimension is the same). Thus, the number of iterations for consensus convergence became a dominant factor to affect the computation time. 4.2.3 Energy performance comparison In order to assess the overall performance of the proposed distributed RtOpt scheme, its energy consumption was evaluated under three weather conditions in Fig. 5. The energy performance of the fixed set-point scheme was used as a benchmark. The settings of the sub-system set-points for the benchmark case are presented in Table 5 . The total power profiles of all three schemes for the spring, summer and autumn were presented in Fig. 9 (a\u2013c). Table 6 summarizes the energy use of these three schemes with potential energy savings. Compared with the benchmark case, the distributed RtOpt scheme achieved 4.48%, 10.85% and 6.45% reduction in spring, summer and autumn, respectively, which was similar to that of the centralized RtOpt scheme. 5 Concluding remarks This study presented a holistic development of distributed RtOpt for a typical HVAC system. Considering the functionality and spatial distribution of HVAC components, as well as the economical distribution of the local intelligence in HVAC components, the HVAC system was divided into three sub-systems: cooling distribution sub-system, cooling generation sub-system and heat rejection sub-system. The centralized optimization problem was then decomposed into three sub-problems accordingly and solved in parallel by a dedicated local computational unit to handle each sub-problem. The master problem was still programmed at the BEMS to enable consensus between computational units for global optimality. Case studies were conducted to test and evaluate the proposed distributed RtOpt scheme by comparing it with a centralized RtOpt scheme on a wide range of load conditions. It has been demonstrated that: (1) The proposed scheme can provide high accuracy of optimization with small deviations over the ranges of load conditions compared with the centralized RtOpt scheme. Generally, the proposed algorithm is able to converge to the global optimality of the solution in less than 20 iterations, indicating a high convergence speed. (2) Although the distributed RtOpt scheme requires iterations to reach consensus between sub-systems, the computational load of the BEMS can be significantly reduced. This is because the master problem can be simplified as a mean value calculation using a projected sub-gradient method. Besides, many local measurements, such as temperatures and flowrates, which are essential for RtOpt, are not needed to transmit to the BEMS. (3) The energy performance of the distributed RtOpt scheme is compatible with that of the centralized RtOpt scheme. Compared to the fixed set-point (no optimization) scheme, the proposed scheme is able to provide between 4.48% and 10.85% energy savings in the case study. Since the proposed decomposition scheme requires only the major components, including AHU, chillers and cooling towers, to be equipment with local computational units, the cost to adopt the distributed optimal control in HVAC systems should not be much demanding. The next phase of the study will focus on the development of an agent-based framework to realize the proposed distributed RtOpt scheme in the aspect of the functions of an agent, such as control, optimization, and communication can be standardized [20]. When each sub-system has its optimization agent, coordinated by a coordinating agent (to solve the master problem) in the associated building energy management system (BEMS), global optimization can be performed in a way without much effort in programming in the BEMS.

Appendix A Detailed models of the sub-systems The performance models for the three sub-systems were developed using the variables defined in Fig. A1 . A1. Detailed models of the cooling distribution sub-system According to a study by Cai et al. [34], the power P AH , f of the fan in the AHU is a function of the supply air mass flow rate m ̇ sa and the pressure rise across the fan. When a pressure-independent control is used to control the supply air pressure to be constant, the fan power P AH , f can be written as (A1) P AH , f = α ah , 0 + α ah , 1 m ̇ sa + α ah , 2 m ̇ sa 2 where [ α ah , 0 , α ah , 1 , α ah , 3 ] are model parameters with average values [ - 39.036 , 10.964 , - 0.524 ] . Given the AHU cooling load Q z , the enthalpy of the mixed air h ma and the enthalpy of the supply air h sa , m ̇ sa is calculated by (A2) m ̇ sa = Q z h ma - h sa where h ma is determined by the mixed air temperature T ma and humidity RH ma , and h sa can be calculated according to the supply air temperature T sa and the required humidity RH sa , i.e. h sa = h sa ( T sa , RH sa ) . Therefore, P AH , f is a function of T sa . The power of the chilled water pump at the secondary side is (A3) P ch , p 2 = α ch , 0 + α ch , 1 m ̇ chw , 2 + α ch , 2 m ̇ chw , 2 2 where [ α ch , 0 , α ch , 1 , α ch , 2 ] are the model parameters with average values [15.565, −0.160, 6.638 × 10 - 4 ], and m ̇ chw , 2 satisfies (A4) m ̇ chw , 2 = Q z c w T chwr - T chws According to Velibeyoglu et al. [35], the chilled water return temperature T chwr is calculated by (A5) T chwr - T chws = α ah , 3 + α ah , 4 m ̇ sa + α ah , 5 T ma - T sa where T chws is the set-point for the secondary chilled water temperature, and [ α ah , 3 , α ah , 4 , α ah , 5 ] are the model parameters with average values [ - 4.234 , 5.052 × 10 - 3 , 0.316 ] . (A6) m ̇ chw , 2 = Q z c w α ah , 3 + α ah , 4 m ̇ sa + α ah , 5 T ma - T sa Thus, P ch , p 2 is a function of T sa . The total power of the cooling distribution sub-system is (A7) P sub , 1 = P AHU , f + P ch , p 2 Since P AHU , f and P ch , p 2 are a function of T sa , P sub , 1 is a function of T sa , i.e. P sub , 1 = P sub , 1 T sa . A2. Detailed models of the cooling generation sub-system The respective power use of the chilled water pump at the primary side is given by (A8) P ch , p 1 = β ch , 0 + β ch , 1 m ̇ chw + β ch , 2 m ̇ chw 2 where β ch , 0 , β ch , 1 , a n d β ch , 2 are the model parameters with values [ 12.391 , 0.1316 , 5.824 × 10 - 4 ] . As m ̇ chw is constant, P ch , p 1 is considered to be constant as well, which indicates that β ch , 0 , β ch , 1 , a n d β ch , 2 will not vary during the operation. By assuming that there is no heat loss during the transmission, and according to the law of energy conservation, Q ch satisfies (A9) Q ch = Q z + P ch , p 2 + P ch , p 1 = c w m ̇ chw T chwr ( T chws , T sa ) - T chws where T chwr is function of T chws and T sa . Generally, Q ch will not be heavily affected by P ch , p 2 . Given Q ch , the power of the compressor is given by [36] P ch = α ch , 3 + α ch , 4 T cwr - T chws + α ch , 5 T cwr - T chws 2 + α ch , 6 Q ch + α ch , 7 Q ch 2 + α ch , 8 T cwr - T chws Q ch (A10) where [ α ch , 3 , ⋯ , α ch , 8 ] are the model parameters with average values [ - 272.897 , 19.269 , 0.05869 , 0.05830 , 1.670 × 10 - 5 , - 2.586 × 10 - 4 ] ; and T cwr satisfies c w m ̇ cw T cwr - T cws = Q ch + P ch (A11) which gives T cwr = T cws + Q z + P ch , p 2 + P ch , p 1 + P ch c w m ̇ cw (A12) Therefore, P ch is a function of T sa , T chws and T cws . The total power of the cooling distribution sub-system is P sub , 2 = P ch + P ch , p 1 (A13) which is also a function of T sa , T chws and T cws . A3. Detailed models of the heat rejection sub-system In the cooling tower, P ct , p is the power of the constant-speed pump, given by P ct , p = β ct , 0 + β ct , 1 m ̇ ct , w + β ct , 2 m ̇ ct , w 2 (A14) where β ct , 0 , β ct , 1 , a n d β ct , 2 are the model parameters with values [ 21.550 , 0.2716 , 4.013 × 10 - 4 ] . As m ̇ ct , w is constant, P ct , p is constant as well, which indicates that β ct , 0 , β ct , 1 , a n d β ct , 2 should not vary during the pump operation. The cooling tower fan power is given by P ct , f = α ct , 0 + α ct , 1 m ̇ ct , a + α ct , 2 m ̇ ct , a 2 (A15) where α ct , 0 , α ct , 1 , a n d α ct , 2 are the model parameters with average values [ 0.08162 , 0.05465 , 0.05608 ] , and m ̇ ct , a is the mass flow rate of the air flowing out of the cooling tower. According to Ma and Wang's work [38], m ̇ ct , a can be predicted by m ̇ ct , a = β ct , 3 Q ct β ct , 4 m ̇ ct , w β ct , 5 T cwr , 1 - T wb β ct , 6 (A16) where [ β ct , 3 , β ct , 4 , β ct , 5 ] are the model parameters with values [ 0.04327 , 0.5179 , 0.0514 , 0.2148 ] . Ma work [37] also demonstrated that these parameters are relatively stable and would not vary with a change in the operating condition. Q ct and T cwr , 1 are given by Q ct = Q z + P ch , p 2 + P ch , p 1 + P ch ( T chws , T cws ) + P ct , p (A17) T cwr , 1 = T cws + Q ct c w m ̇ cw (A18) The total power of the heat rejection sub-system is P sub , 3 = P ct , f + P ct , p (A19) which is also a function of T chws and T cws . These performance models were regularly updated in single-step online using recorded data a moving window of seven days with a weighted least square method of identification as demonstrated in [25].

        "dc:description": "Real-time optimal control (RtOpt) is an efficient tool to improve the energy efficiency of heating, ventilating and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems. RtOpt is always centralized and solved entirely in building energy management systems (BEMSs). However, centralized optimization is not be an efficient solution because real-time operation data in local loops need to be sent to the central computation unit in BEMS for optimization. This paper, therefore, proposes a distributed RtOpt scheme for typical centralized HVAC systems, which uses a dual decomposition mechanism to break the centralized problem into one mater problem and several sub-problems that can be solved in parallel and independently. The mater problem is converted to a simple mean value calculation using a projected sub-gradient method, thus distributing the computation load from the central computation unit into local computation units. Unlike available decomposition schemes in literature, the proposed method considered the functionality and spatial distribution of the major components of HVAC systems, which could enhance the physical meaning and facilitate the application of the decomposition scheme. The proposed distributed RtOpt scheme was tested in case studies, with numerical analysis being used to demonstrate its potential benefits.",
