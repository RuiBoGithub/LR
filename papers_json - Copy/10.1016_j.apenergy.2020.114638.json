Department of Mechanical Engineering Texas A&M University College Station TX 77843 USA Sensors are one of the fundamental components for sensor-rich controls in buildings but are prone to different errors. Existing studies show that sensor errors hold a place among top-priority faults in building systems. Before we take countermeasures to mitigate the sensor errors, it is vital to prioritize key sensors and quantify the collective impacts of concurrent sensor errors. In response to this, a simulation-based methodology is introduced to conduct a comprehensive sensor error impact analysis in building systems, which adds a stochastic sensor prioritization through a sensitivity analysis on top of a commonly used deterministic sensor error quantification. The synergies of these two parts help better interpret the sensor error impacts on building energy consumption, ventilation performance, thermal comfort, etc. A sensor-rich CO2-based Demand-Controlled Ventilation system is used as a case study to demonstrate the viability of the methodology as a proof-of-the-concept. The results show that the energy savings potential and ventilation performance are mostly influenced by the accuracy of the AHU outdoor airflow sensors. The accuracy of zone level airflow sensors has a negligible impact on both energy savings and ventilation performance. The accuracy of zone CO2 sensors has more influence on the ventilation performance compared with the accuracy of zone airflow sensors. Compared with the baseline case with zero errors, the largest deviation percentages could reach 16.90% and 94.32%, respectively, in terms of the Heating, Ventilation, and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) annual energy consumption and the Outdoor Air Ratio (OAR) when multiple key sensors suffer from normal error intensities simultaneously.

Sensors are the fundamental devices at the bottom field level of monitoring and control systems to enable smart buildings. A sensor system serves to sense the variables of interest and send the sensing data to the corresponding monitoring and control devices. A large number of heterogeneous sensors are deployed in a sophisticated building system to measure a variety of variables such as temperature, humidity, airflow rates, thermos-fluid (e.g., chilled and hot water) flow rates, CO2 concentration, valve and damper positions, sub-hourly electric demand, etc. On top of that, many advanced sensor-enabled advanced controls have been adopted to ensure the operational performance of buildings as well as the comfort, safety, and security of building occupants in these IoT-based smart buildings. However, sensors are inevitably prone to different types of faults, which lead to the unnoticed control malfunction, the sub-optimal operation, and the potential energy waste [1,2]. National Renewable Energy Laboratory conducted a building system fault estimation of the prevalence, energy impact, and financial impact of 47 common faults. A list of 20 top-priority faults was identified and rank-ordered in terms of annual energy and financial impact values [2]. Four of these faults were related to sensors. Li and O\u2019Neill used a Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) approach to investigate fault impacts in a medium-sized office building in four different climate zones in the U.S. Sensor faults such as Variable Air Volume (VAV) terminal box airflow sensor drifting were one of top three faults in terms of impacts on the HVAC energy consumption and occupant thermal comfort [3]. The sensor faults can generally be divided into two categories: hard failures and soft errors (e.g., bias, drifts, scale factors, and environmental noises, along with the building operation). The hard failures have intuitively deteriorated impacts on the system operation. Comparatively, it is well acknowledged that the impact of soft errors is hard to assess [4]. In general, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the sensor measurement is critical to the building system control, operation, and optimization. Nevertheless, the commissioning work is normally performed before or just after the building is occupied, and frequent calibrations of all the sensors during the building operation phase are cost-prohibited and labor-intensive due to a large number of heterogeneous sensors. Therefore, it is vital to know the potential impacts of the sensor soft errors and communicate this knowledge to building managers/owners. Some existing studies from other domains (e.g., electro-mechanical application [5], aerospace [6,7], process control [8], etc.) evaluated the impact of different sensor soft errors through the sensor error modeling. Similarly, the sensor error impact could also be analyzed using a building performance simulation [9]. Table 1 presents an exhausted review of existing studies on the sensor error impact analysis of the building systems, including the sensor types, the sensor error cases, the simulation engines, and the impact outputs. Zhang et al. [10] introduced three modeling approaches (Input data file modification, energy management system module, and newly developed fault objects) using EnergyPlus to quantify the economizer sensors and zone thermostat errors in terms of the energy consumptions and thermal comfort. The sensor errors are injected into the model by tuning the fixed sensor error parameters (e.g. ±1 K for the zone thermostat errors) in different cases. Using a similar deterministic approach, Yoon et al. [11] presented a detailed analysis of temperature sensor bias impacts on the HVAC system energy performance. Seven individual and combined cases were designed to investigate the positive offsets, negative offsets, and combined canceling effects. Chen et al. [12] performed both daily onset and week-long fault impact analysis for the temperature sensor offsets using the co-simulation of Modelica and EnergyPlus with both energy and comfort metrics. Likewise, the economic impact of persistent temperature sensor and actuator faults were analyzed in concrete core activated office buildings using the co-simulation of TRNSYS and MATLAB [13]. Besides energy and thermal comfort related impacts, Behl et al. studied the uncertainty propagation from the temperature sensor bias on the model-based predictive control performance [14]. O\u2019Neill [15] investigated the Air Handler Unit (AHU) economizer sensor bias on the AHU operation and control performance using Modelica. Recently, Rackes et al. [16] studied the impact of the sensor accuracy and placement on the routine indoor air quality monitoring in buildings using CONTAM. Gunay et al. [17] investigated the benefits of early detection and maintenance of sensor faults in AHUs regarding the energy use intensity and the predicted percentage of dissatisfied. Although these studies presented the sensor error impacts with high fidelity building simulation tools, several gaps still need to be addressed. These include: (1) Most studies targeted at the single type of sensor errors, such as temperature sensors [11\u201315,18,19]. In nowadays sophisticated IoT-based building systems, various sensors are prone to have the sensor bias simultaneously. It is imperative to consider sensor errors from different types of sensors concurrently and their impacts on the building system performance when designing building sensor networks for advanced controls. (2) For the combined sensor error analysis, most existing studies target at a small number of different sensors [10,16,20]. In addition, the case designs arbitrarily assign combinations of sensor types and sensor error intensities. Theoretically, we could run a large-scale simulation of all the combinations of sensor errors with different sensor error intensities to have an understanding of the error impact from different sensors. However, with a large network of heterogeneous sensors in modern smart buildings and possible limited computation resources in practice, it is more efficient and effective to conduct a sensor error analysis only for the sensors with large impacts that are selected through a sensor prioritization. (3) Most of these studies (except [17] in Table 1) use a deterministic approach that the values for the sensor error related parameters are fixed. Although these studies could also reflect the sensor importance, the credibility and significance of the sensor fault impact results depend heavily on the case designs and number of the cases that run in these studies. In addition, it is hard to rank different types of sensors using this approach since the sensor error parameters are different and thus their impact with different sensor error intensities is hard to compare. By comparison, sensor prioritization uses a stochastic approach that the values for the sensor error related parameters are random. It is becoming increasingly important for the facility maintenance with a myriad of sensors installed in the Building Automation System (BAS) of smart buildings. Li et al. [21] proposed a preventive approach to determine the sensor\u2019s importance and maintenance requirements. The magnitude of the Standardized Regression Coefficients (SRCs) was adopted as the sensitivity analysis index to calculate the sensor importance. After determining the sensor importance ranking, the sensor calibration frequency was provided by calculating a polynomial function that described the degradation rate of the building performance index. In another related study [22], the sensitivity of different sensors was taken into account to better calibrate the sensors using a virtual in-situ calibration approach. In summary, the sensor error sensitivity analysis (SA) is meaningful and has its own implications for the sensor error impact analysis. Based on the aforementioned reviews, it is noted that current studies in the building domain only focused on a deterministic quantification of sensor errors. These studies could not well justify the overall sensor error impact because more heterogeneous sensors exist in the real building system and interactions of the sensors are non-linear. Meanwhile, the sensor importance and the extreme effects of the sensor errors inferred from the deterministic quantification are not compelling by itself due to the limited number of simulation runs. Therefore, we added the stochastic sensor prioritization on top of a commonly used deterministic sensor error quantification in this methodology. Although the sensor prioritization is believed to present a more compelling result, the deterministic sensor error quantification is still needed for the engineers and practitioners to learn the impact of most concerned sensors through individual and combined error cases analyses. To the best knowledge of the authors, no existing studies use the synergies of both stochastic and deterministic approaches to conduct a comprehensive sensor fault impact analyses. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the systematic framework of the comprehensive sensor error modeling, which adds the sensor prioritization on top of the commonly used deterministic sensor error quantification. As a proof-of-concept, a case study which aims at evaluating the robustness of the CO2-based demand ventilation control (DCV) sequence due to the sensor bias is presented following the proposed methodology in Section 3. Finally, key conclusions are discussed in Section 4. 2 Methodology 2.1 Overview A comprehensive methodology of sensor error impact analysis is proposed to better interpret the impact of the sensor soft errors in the HVAC system. As mentioned in the introduction part, a stochastic sensor prioritization through a sensitivity analysis is added on top of a commonly used deterministic sensor error quantification. Therefore, the methodology includes three key steps: (1) sensor error models presented in Section 2.2, 2) a stochastic sensor prioritization through a sensitivity analysis in Section 2.3, and 3) a deterministic sensor error quantification through individual and combined error cases in Section 2.4. Fig. 1 shows the entire workflow of the proposed methodology. For the sensor prioritization, it is adopted to rank the sensor importance and indicate on what extent the building systems are impacted through its output distribution. For the sensor error quantification, it quantifies multi-sensor error impacts of interest through individual and combined sensor error case designs. The synergies of the two parts lies in that (1) based on the results from the sensor prioritization, the collective impacts of critical sensors can be evaluated. (2) Cross verification of the results between these two methods can be conducted. 2.2 Sensor error models This subsection details how the sensor error is injected and modeled in the implementation tools. First, we will discuss the mathematical representations of sensor errors. Then we will illustrate how the errors are modeled and implemented. In addition, we will discuss the output variables of concern for the sensor error impact analysis. The mathematical representations of the sensor errors have been developed in previous studies [13,21,24,25], which could be decomposed into three parts: multiplicative errors, bias, and noise, as illustrated in Eq. (1). (1) V EP = 1 + m · V EF + ε bias + ε noi , where VEP and VEF represent the error-presented value and the error-free value, respectively. m is the multiplicative offset of the scaling error. ε bias and ε noi denote the deviation caused by the bias errors and the noise, which could be further represented by Eqs. (2) and (3), respectively. (2) ε bias = ε BOP + ε dri + ∑ n = 1 n ( t ) ε i , r , where ε BOP is the fixed bias due to the testing and calibration, which could be assumed as zero when the sensor is well calibrated during the commissioning stage. ε dri could be quantified as a linear function of the time or simplified as a fixed value [25]. ε i , r is the random variation due to the ith random stress experienced during the testing and the calibration. (3) ε noi = a · N μ , σ , where a is the noise amplitude added on the random normal distribution. N ( μ , σ ) is assumed as a normal distribution that the noise follows. It can be inferred from Eqs. (1)\u2013(3) that a comprehensive sensor error may be composed of fixed errors, random errors, and time-changing errors (or error that follows a prior knowledge). We could manipulate the parameters of different sensor error types to inject the error to the simulation. The sensor errors will be imposed on the related modules in different modeling implementation platforms. Various building system emulation platforms are available to simulate the sensor errors. Suitable tools include EnergyPlus [26]/OpenStudio [27], Modelica [28], TRNSYS [29], HVACSIM+ [30], etc. Taking EnergyPlus as an example, the most recent version (Version 9.2.0) provides several types of off-the-shelf sensor error object models, such as economizer sensor drift, zone thermostat drift. However, the fault modeling capability in EnergyPlus is still limited and under an active development. To develop new fault models, EnergyPlus EMS object, OpenStudio measures, and EnergyPlus IDF input parameter perturb through external scripts are the typical approaches [3]. On the other hand, as an equation-based object-oriented modeling language for dynamic systems, Modelica brings more flexibility due to the access to more operational parameters. In addition, it emulates the fast dynamics of the building energy system and the control system with a high fidelity (e.g., the loop pressure/resistance can be explicitly modeled in Modelica, which is not considered in some building emulators). In the domain of building simulation, each fault modeling tool has several pros and cons, as tabulated in Table 2 . The building emulators could generate tons of output variables according to the complexity of the building system models. To conduct an effective sensor error analysis, there is a need to determine the key performance indicators (KPIs) to quantify the impacts. In general, KPIs can be direct or indirect outputs from sensor error models. It should be noted that different sensors have distinct impacts on the choice of KPIs. For example, some sensors have more impacts on the energy consumption while other sensors are more acute to the indoor air quality. Various categories of the KPIs and their representative variables are summarized in Table 3 . Variables from different categories could be combined to form a composite KPI with weights assigned. It is also feasible to select two KPIs to conduct the sensor error analysis of a two-dimensional impact. 2.3 Sensor prioritization This subsection will detail how the injected senor errors are ranked using the Monte Carlo simulation and a sensitivity analysis through a simulation-based approach. It is a stochastic approach since the sensor error related parameters (e.g., sensor scaling or bias) are random. A Monte Carlo simulation is conducted to obtain the impact of sensor error uncertainties on the simulation outputs of interest. During this Monte Carlo simulation, sensor error samples are generated using the sensor error intensity distribution, followed by a large-scale simulation of samples. The outputs from the large-scale simulation generally follow a bi-modal or multi-model distribution due to the non-linearity of the building systems. This output distribution also indicates on what extent the building systems are impacted. On top of that, a sensitivity analysis is conducted as a ranking method to determine the sensitivity of the outputs to the inputs associated with sensors and rank the importance of the sensors. To conduct the Monte Carlo simulation, firstly, a sensor error intensity distribution needs to be defined. Since there exist few statistics data or maintenance records regarding the sensor error intensity, a normal distribution (ND) is usually assumed to describe the associated error intensity [13,21,34], as shown in Eq. (4). (4) f x | σ = 1 σ 2 π e - 1 2 ( x σ ) 2 , where x represents the sensor error associated parameters such as the sensor scaling m or the sensor bias εbias in Eq. (1). σ depends on the quality and type of sensors. Based on the prescribed sensor error intensity distribution, different sampling methods could be used to estimate the characteristics of the whole population from a subset, including the simple random sampling method, the stratified sampling, the Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) method, the Quasi-random sampling such as the Sobol sequence, the factorial sampling, etc. [35]. The LHS method is one of the most commonly used sampling techniques in building system models for its clear comprehensibility and stratification feature [36]. In Ref. [37], the LHS and the quasi-random sampling were nominated as two recommended sampling techniques for building applications. However, other researchers asserted that the LHS does not have the edge on the simple random sampling when the model is not computationally demanding [38]. In the sensor error ranking use case, an inverse transform sampling technique [39] can be applied to generate the perturbed parameters to make the errors to follow the proposed error intensity distribution. As depicted in Fig. 2 , the curve represents the cumulative density function derived from the probability density distribution (see Eq. (5)). The y-axis contains the samples in the range of [0, 1] (the red 1 1 For interpretation of color in Figs. 2, 3 and 9, the reader is referred to the web version of this article. points) generated by one of the aforementioned sampling methods (i.e., quasi-random sampling). Correspondingly, the x-axis is the sampled sensor error associated parameters (the blue points) derived from the inverse function F−1(y). In general, a suitable sampling method should not only sufficiently represent the characteristics of the sensor error intensity but also accelerate the convergence of the computation. After generating the sensor errors associated input samples for the emulators, a large-scale simulation can be performed with outputs of interest. (5) y = F ( x ) = ∫ - ∞ x f x d x ⇒ ND 1 σ b 2 π ∫ - ∞ x e - 1 2 ( x σ b ) 2 d x , We then could rank the sensor error impact with the input samples and output data of concern using a sensitivity analysis (SA). Different SA indexes could be computed as the measures of the sensor importance, including the standardized regression coefficient, the Pearson correlation coefficient (PEAR index), Morris method indicators, Sobol index, etc. Readers could refer to [35] to learn the details of the pros and cons of different SA methods for building applications. With the increasing complexity of the building system model, sometimes, it is computationally intensive to conduct a SA by directly using the building simulation program. Therefore, using a surrogate model to replace the detailed physical model is an effective workaround to reduce the time and computational costs. 2.4 Sensor error quantification In this section, the systematic methodology of a sensor error quantification is proposed, in which a massive number of deterministic cases are designed to quantify the sensor error impacts. Considering the sensor bias direction, sensor error intensity, and the interaction between the errors, both individual and combined sensor error cases are formulated. The selection of the sensor error modeling tools and the output KPIs follows the same procedure listed in Section 2.2. For individual sensor error cases, we consider the sensor error in a single location. Different offset intensities of the sensor error parameters in Eq. (1) are assigned for both the positive and negative directions. For example, in a sensor network of ten temperature sensors with different locations, each temperature bias can be +2, +4, −2, −4, respectively. Therefore, the total number of individual sensor error cases is 40. For the combined sensor error cases, simultaneous errors occur in different sensor locations with the same or mixed sensor types. For example, we could simulate the collective impacts of the sensor errors injected at all locations. Factors such as sensor importance, sensor error interaction, additive and cancelling effects, etc. are suggested to be taken into account when designing the cases. Therefore, the case design could include the multiple errors that come from: (1) Sensors with higher importance based on the results in Section 2.3; (2) Sensors with the same error impact direction based on the results in individual cases; (3) Sensors with opposite error impact direction based on the results in individual cases; (4) Sensors with the positive offset directions; and (5) Sensors with the negative offset directions. Running all the individual and combined cases, we could quantify and compare the impacts for all the output KPIs of concern by post-processing the simulation results. For a single output KPI, a line graph or a bar chart could be depicted to demonstrate the trend of the impact among different cases. For two-dimensional output KPIs, a scatter diagram could be plotted to demonstrate the impact distribution of all the cases. On the other hand, results from all the deterministic cases could also indirectly testify the results of the sensor prioritization. For example, we could compare the output KPI variations to figure out the sensor importance from all the individual cases. 3 Case study In this section, a case study of sensor error impact regarding a sensor-rich demand-controlled ventilation (DCV) system is described as a proof-of-concept of the proposed methodology. Section 3.1 describes the building system description, sensor lists, and DCV control logics. Section 3.2 details how the sensor error models are implemented in a building emulator using the co-simulation of EnergyPlus and CONTAM. In Sections 3.3 and 3.4, the implementation and results of the sensor prioritization and sensor error quantification are presented, respectively. 3.1 Case study building description The Iowa Energy Center Energy Resource Station (ERS) is the targeted building for this case study. It is located in the Des Moines Area Community College Ankeny campus, and was built for the purposes of examining various energy-efficiency measures and demonstrating innovative HVAC concepts. There are eight test rooms, four offices, two classrooms, and a media center, etc. Fig. 3 shows the ERS building outlook, the rendered geometry using DesignBuilder, and the floor plan, respectively. Three of the eight test rooms (East A, South B and Interior B) have installed zone CO2 sensors since their room types are conference rooms, which have a large distinction of occupancy in different time and a dense occupancy in certain time. The other five rooms are office rooms which have installed occupancy sensors and rendered as potentially critical spaces. The cooling and heating source are an electric chiller and a natural gas boiler. Two single duct Variable Air Volume (VAV) AHUs serve the eight test rooms (red circled in Fig. 3) and one serves the other non-test rooms, respectively. The terminal units are VAV boxes with hot water reheat coils. The basic control system for the system is shown in Fig. 4 . Key components and sensors (bolded as follows) are: \u2022 Airflow measuring station (AFMS) across the entire outdoor air intake. \u2022 Outdoor air economizer system including return air and outdoor air dampers. \u2022 Supply air fan with variable frequency drive. \u2022 Supply air CO2 sensor. \u2022 Densely occupied zones (as defined by ASHRAE Standard 90.1 [40]) with zone CO2 sensors. \u2022 VAV terminal boxes with reheat coils and pressure independent digital controls, including primary airflow sensors and supply air temperature sensors as required to perform dual maximum VAV logic [41,42]. \u2022 Sparsely occupied zones with no additional occupancy controls. \u2022 Other zones with occupancy presence sensors. The DCV control sequences are composed of VAV zone level controls and AHU system level controls. At the zone level, actual zone ventilation needs are dynamically determined using CO2 and occupancy sensors for occupant component, adjusted for zone air distribution effectiveness based on supply air temperature. For example, for the zones with CO2 sensors, the required breathing zone outdoor airflow Vbz is calculated as Eq. (6). The zone primary airflow minimums are reset using Trim & Respond (T&R) logic [41]. If the primary air is rich with outdoor air due to an economizer operation, zone minimums are reduced. Otherwise, the zone minimums are increased for critical zones only to ensure the required outdoor airflow rate at AHU is never above the design rate. At the system level, the required AHU outdoor airflow rate is dynamically determined using the ASHRAE Standard 62.1 Ventilation Rate Procedure [40]. The studied DCV control sequences are validated through the simulation testbed (as described below in Section 3.2) and the real functional testing in the ERS building. All model validation results and control strategies implementations can be found from [43]. (6) V bz = M I N P z R p + A z R a | max 0 , C bz - C s E z V pz R p ] k · M e t + A z R a , where: Cbz = the zone CO2 concentration, ppm. Cs = the CO2 concentration in the supply air at the AHU, ppm. Ez = the zone air distribution effectiveness in the current zone mode, equal to Ezh in heating mode and Ezc in cooling mode. Vpz = the zone primary air discharge airflow, m3/s. k = CO2 generation rate = 3.9643 m3/s/p/met. Met = metabolic rate = 1 met. Pz = design zone population. Rp = people component of ventilation rate, m3/s/p. Ra = area component of ventilation rate, m/s. Az = floor area, m2. The DCV control systems, which consist of CO2 sensors, airflow sensors, and occupancy sensors, are applied to eight test rooms along with an AHU serving these rooms. For the non-test rooms and associated HVAC equipment and system, the control logic follows the typical single path VAV control sequences. Please note that while three of the eight test rooms have installed the CO2 sensors, all the eight test rooms apply the DCV control strategy. Since we focus on evaluating the sensor error impacts from the CO2-based DCV controls, ten sensors are considered in the case study: three zone CO2 sensors for critical occupied zones (East A, South B, Interior B), three zone supply airflow sensors in the same test rooms, two AHU supply air CO2 sensors, and two AHU outside airflow sensors. More details of the ERS building system information can be found from Ref. [43,44]. 3.2 Sensor error models As mentioned in Section 3.1, two types of sensors are considered in this sensor error study for CO2-based DCV in buildings: CO2 sensor and airflow sensor. The mathematical expression for sensor errors is provided in Eqs. (1)\u2013(3). For this study, the CO2 sensor is assumed to have a fixed absolute bias as shown in Eq. (7). This assumes we neglect the scaling error, the random bias due to the testing and calibration, the time-changing bias, as well as the sensor noise for the CO2 sensors. These assumptions are based on the conversations with field control engineers and literatures [43,45]. Similarly as shown in Eq. (8), the airflow sensor is assumed to have fixed scaling errors relative to the current sensor readings. (7) V c o 2 _ E P = V c o 2 _ E F + ε C O 2 _ b i a s (8) V airflow = ( 1 + m ) V a i r f l o w _ E F The error models are implemented in EnergyPlus 9.0.1 with Energy Management System (EMS) feature. EnergyPlus is a whole building simulation program developed by the U.S. Department of Energy. It models heating, cooling, lighting, and ventilating processes in buildings and includes many simulation capabilities, such as time steps of less than one hour, modular systems, multizone airflow, thermal comfort, and natural ventilation. The model can also represent \u201cplug\u201d loads including computers and calculates both the direct electrical energy consumption and also the effects of heat gains in the building. The model takes as input a description of the building (e.g., geometry, materials, roof type, window type, shading geometry, location, orientation etc.), its usage and internal heat loads related to lighting, plug and occupant load, and the HVAC system description, and then computes the energy flows, zonal temperatures, airflows, and comfort levels on sub-hourly intervals for periods of days to years. To ensure the model is realistic, multiple internal load profiles for occupants, lighting, and plug loads are developed and semi-randomly assigned to different zones throughout the year. Detailed of this EnergyPlus model can be found from [43]. EnergyPlus Runtime Language (Erl) is used to program and describe the above error models in EMS module. All sensors with errors need to be included into the EMS Sensor. The control strategies written in the EMS subroutines that use sensor information take such information embedded in the EMS sensor to make the control decision. These decisions (e.g., minimum damper position, minimum outside airflow rate, etc.) are then passed back to the EnergyPlus simulation through an EMS Actuator. Fig. 5 illustrates how the sensor and actuator information is exchanged and moved along the time step in the EMS module for simulations with and without sensor errors. For example, in the DCV control logic, we need to calculate the required ventilation in breathing zones, Vbz, using the zone primary air discharge airflow, Vpz , zone CO2 concentration, Cbz , and AHU supply air CO2 concentration, Cs , as shown in Eq. (6). Different values of sensor bias will be applied to Vpz , Cbz and Cs . Table 4 shows the pseudo code of EMS subroutines for Vbz calculation. The codes with shaded backgrounds represent the sensor error models that are employed. The building system emulator is the co-simulation of EnergyPlus and CONTAM using FMU since CONTAM could provide a more precise infiltration rate and inter-zone air mixing calculation, which will significantly affect the final simulation results. Readers could find the details of the co-simulation setup in Refs. [44,46]. The ERS annual simulation is conducted in Chicago, IL, and the simulation time steps in EnergyPlus and CONTAM are both 5 min. The selected output KPIs are the annual total HVAC related energy consumption from the \u2018Building Energy Performance\u2019 Category and OAR from the \u2018Indoor Air Quality/Ventilation\u2019 Category in Table 3. 3.3 Sensor error impact prioritization and results The general approach for the sensor error impact prioritization using EnergyPlus is shown in Fig. 6 . The sensor readings are captured using an EnergyPlus EMS Sensor, and then these readings are automatically perturbed with an assumed sensor error distribution to generate samples (i.e., new EnergyPlus IDF input files with perturbed sensor information) using Python scripts. These IDF files (samples) with new sensor readings are processed by the control sequences written in the EMS subroutines, which generate different control actions based on these perturbed sensor readings. These new control actions are then passed back to the EnergyPlus simulation through an EnergyPlus EMS Actuator. In this study, the base model is the model with zero sensor errors. All sensors under the study are perturbed at the same time. The sensor error intensity distribution is assumed to be a normal distribution for this case study. Fig. 7 (a) shows 2000 samples of sensor errors with a normal distribution of a zero mean for a zone CO2 sensor. The fixed absolute bias is ±300 ppm in this example. Fig. 7(b) shows 2000 samples of sensor errors with a normal distribution of a zero mean for an AHU outside airflow rate sensor. The upper limit for the flow sensor error is ±100% of the current sensor reading in this case study. The standard deviation used in both normal distributions (CO2 concentration and AHU outside air airflow) are 100 and 0.33, respectively. Fig. 8 depicts the implementation of the sample generation for 2000 EnergyPlus IDF input files. At the first level, there are 2000 samples of sensor values for each sensor pool. Gaussian sampling method is applied to randomly choose sensor values. A random number from 1 to 2000 for each pool is independently generated to choose one specific sensor value (with the error). All randomly selected sensor values are then combined into one sample EnergyPlus input IDF file. This means that all sensors are randomly perturbed at the same time in this study. After 2000 EnergyPlus IDF input file samples are generated using scripts, EnergyPlus annual simulations are conducted and we could obtain the output distributions from 2000 EnergyPlus simulations. During each individual simulation, the EnergyPlus EMS module generates control actions for the actuators to take. A Sobol index, which is a global derivative-based approach, is used for the sensitivity analysis. The Sobol index is being used to help understand which sensor has the largest influence on the selected KPIs. The following function is used to calculate the Sobol index [47]. (9) μ m = ∫ ∂ f ∂ x m d x where f is a response surface model of the EnergyPlus simulation and xm is the mth uncertain parameter in the model. The integration is performed over all dimensions of the sampling points (the entire hypercube). μm is an L1 norm output of the derivative of the meta model f. The Sobol index calculated using the equation above measures the sensitivity across the whole input space and can deal with nonlinear responses. The response surface model used in the Sobol analysis of this study is a Bayesian Network model [48], which uses a directed acyclic graph to represent a set of variables and their conditional dependencies. The importance of sensors is ranked using the Sobol index for selected KPIs (annual HVAC energy consumption, hours with OAR < 1 for the ventilation). Fig. 9 shows the histogram plots of the HVAC energy consumption and the ventilation performance (i.e., hours when OAR < 1) from 2000 Monte Carlo simulations. The red dot in each figure denotes the result for the case with zero sensor errors. The histogram plots show that both energy consumption and ventilation performance are sensitive to the simulated CO2 and airflow sensor errors. The distributions for HVAC energy consumption and hours when OAR is less than 1 have a multi-modal distribution. This is probably due to the nonlinearities in the EnergyPlus model. In addition, the proposed sequences include limits to protect against the impact of sensor errors. For example, the required ventilation in breathing zones Vbz cannot be greater than the design Vbz values, and the required outdoor air ventilation rate Vot cannot be greater than the design Vot values. All these limits could lead to lower energy use and more hours when OAR < 1. We can see both trends in Fig. 9. Fig. 10 (a) shows the Sobol index for 10 sensors relative to the HVAC related energy consumption. AHU outside airflow sensors have the largest influence on energy consumption, while the zone airflow sensor accuracy has negligible impacts. The impact of supply and zone-level CO2 sensor accuracy are also very small. Fig. 10(b) shows the Sobol index for 10 sensors relative to the ventilation performance. The ventilation performance was assessed by looking at the hours when the system is under-ventilating (i.e., OAR is less than 1). AHU supply air CO2 sensors have the largest influence on the ventilation performance. AHU outside airflow sensors and zone level CO2 sensors have relatively large impacts as well. Comparatively, the impact from zone level airflow sensors is relatively small. Overall, it can be concluded that CO2 sensor accuracy has more influence on the ventilation performance compared with airflow sensors from the specific DCV control logics in this case study. Fig. 11 shows an annual histogram plot of OAR ratios from 2000 Monte Carlo simulations when the HVAC system is on. There are some variations of the OAR among these simulations. Table 5 lists the number of hours for OAR in different ranges for all hours (4,689,000 hrs) from 2000 simulations. Using the current stochastic sensor error perturbation, the system is under-ventilating only about 4% of all the time for all 2000 cases. It can be seen that the majority of the time the OAR is over 1, which indicates that the studied DCV control sequence is robust in the ventilation performance regarding the sensor errors. Based on the presented results in Fig. 10, we can infer that the most critical sensor is AHU outside air flow sensor since it has a dominated impact on the HVAC energy consumption while has some effect on OAR for the ventilation performance. Although the AHU supply air CO2 sensor has a dominated influence on the OAR, this sensor is not that critical since the studied DCV control sequence is robust to the sensor errors for the ventilation performance. This inference could be valuable to building operators during the commissioning or the maintenance for this system. 3.4 Sensor error quantification and results A deterministic sensor error study was conducted using the annual EnergyPlus simulation of the ERS building in Chicago, IL. Individual and combined sensor error cases are designed considering the sensor error direction, sensor error intensity, and sensor importance, as outlined in Section 2.4. Table 6 summarizes the design of a total of 56 cases. The first 48 cases are the individual and combined sensor error cases for CO2 sensors or airflow sensors, respectively. The last eight cases are designed based on the sensor prioritization from Section 3.3, where the sensor errors occur in both CO2 and airflow sensors with high impacts. Fig. 12 plots the total annual HVAC energy consumption deviations for the first 48 sensor error cases from the zero error case. The CO2 sensors with a bias of ±100 ppm have negligible impacts on the HVAC energy consumption, while the CO2 sensor with a bias of +200 ppm in the Interior B conference room reduces the HVAC energy consumption by 9.6%. The AHU outside airflow sensor has the most significant impact on the HVAC energy consumption compared with other airflow sensors which have negligible impacts. An error of +20% for AHU outside airflow sensor results in a 13.86% HVAC energy reduction. These results from the deterministic study cross-verify the results from the stochastic study in Section 3.3. It is also noted that results from Cases # 21\u201324 demonstrate that there is no difference between these cases compared to the zero error case in terms of the selected KPIs. This is because the bias of the zone CO2 sensor and the AHU supply CO2 sensor cancel out each other, as seen in Eq. (6). Table 7 lists the simulation results, including the HVAC annual energy consumption and under-ventilated hours for Cases 1\u201348. Fig. 13 plots the under-ventilated hour deviations for the first 48 cases with sensor errors from the zero error case. An under-ventilated hour is when the provided ventilation is less than the requirement (i.e., OAR < 1). It can be seen that the sensor bias from all the CO2 sensors has a certain influence on the ventilation performance. The deviation rate becomes way larger when the sensor error intensities are escalated (e.g., from ±100 ppm to ±200 ppm). For the airflow sensors, the AHU outside airflow sensors have accountable impacts on the ventilation performance while the zone level airflow sensors have negligible influences on the system ventilation performance. The positive bias of the AHU outdoor airflow sensors has a positive impact on the ventilation performance, while the negative bias has a negative effect. Fig. 14 shows a histogram plot of OAR for the first 48 cases for all hours when AHU is ON. Table 8 lists the number of hours for OAR in different ranges. With the current deterministic sensor error perturbation, the system is under-ventilating only about 4% of the time for all the cases. For these under-ventilated hours, 72% of the time, the OAR is between 0.9 and 1 (i.e., under-ventilating less than 10%), which further illustrated the robustness of the proposed DCV control sequences, along with the results shown in Table 5. Table 9 lists the simulation results for the combined sensor error cases with mixed sensor types. These cases are designed based on the sensor importance presented in Fig. 10 and sensor individual error results in Table 7. Due to the collective effects of the combined key sensor errors, the largest deviation for the HVAC annual energy consumption and under-ventilated hours can be 16.90% and 94.32%, respectively. It is noted that the ventilation performance is degraded by 65.91% on the condition when AHU outdoor airflow sensors are negatively biased by 20%, and AHU CO2 sensor is negatively biased by 200 ppm (or all zone CO2 sensors are positively biased by 200 ppm). 4 Conclusions and future work With the proliferation of IoT devices in smart buildings, many advanced sensor-driven controls are widely adopted to ensure the operational performance of facilities as well as the comfort, safety, and security of building occupants. In this paper, a simulation-based methodology is introduced to conduct a comprehensive sensor error impact analysis for these smart building systems, which includes both the stochastic sensor prioritization through a sensitivity analysis and the deterministic sensor error quantification through an individual and a combined error cases analysis. These two parts help better interpret the sensor error impact. A case study of a sensor-rich CO2-based demand-controlled ventilation system is studied using a whole building simulation program, EnergyPlus, to demonstrate the viability of the methodology as a proof-of-the-concept. The sensor error impact prioritization includes 2000 cases with randomly generated sensor errors through the Monte Carlo method while the deterministic study includes 56 cases with different specified sensor errors, along with the zero error case. Both approaches indicate that the energy savings potential and the ventilation performance are influenced mostly by the accuracy of AHU outdoor airflow sensors. The accuracy of zone level airflow sensors has a negligible impact on both energy savings and ventilation performance. The zone CO2 sensor accuracy has more influence on the ventilation performance compared with the zone airflow sensor accuracy. The largest error impact could reach a deviation rate of 16.90% and 94.32% in terms of the HVAC annual energy consumption and the outdoor air ratio when multiple key sensors suffer from normal error intensities (e.g., AHU outdoor air airflow sensor with a positive scaling error of 20%, AHU supply air CO2 sensor with a negative bias of 200 ppm) simultaneously. Although the proposed methodology is demonstrated to be well applied in this case study and is expected to be scalable to other applications of sensors and control, the current implementation might be subject to limitations and uncertainties from multiple sources as listed below: (1) The selection of the modeling platform. EnergyPlus, the current sensor error modeling platform being used, might be hard to analyze the sensor error impact in the building fast dynamics such as building-to-grid interactive controls. Therefore, we will apply this framework to a different modeling platform, for example, Modelica to fulfill the scalability requirement. (2) The selection of ranking method. Sensitivity analysis is being used as a sensor error prioritization method in this framework. However, there exist other feature ranking methods and statistical evaluation indexes in the machine learning field. Different ranking methods will be tested as a near future work. (3) The inclusion of different sensor error types. In this paper, we only consider the fixed bias error for the CO2 sensors and fixed scaling error for the airflow sensors at this stage because these errors frequently happen for these two sensor types in the building systems based on conversations with field control engineers. It is suggested to conduct a more complete analysis that incorporate the other sensor error types (e.g. random errors, and time-changing errors) under the proposed methodology. Following the proposed analysis process, different stakeholders could have a sense of the sensor importance and quantify the associated impact in smart buildings. To further demonstrate the scalability of the proposed method, the ongoing and near future work also includes applying this proposed framework to analyze the sensor error impact of the CO2-based DCV in multiple zone VAV systems with multiple recirculation paths (e.g., dual fan dual duct VAV system, VAV system with fan-powered terminal units), where local control sequences are more intricate and more sensors are involved. In addition, a sensor error impact analysis for the occupancy sensors, including both occupancy presence sensor and people counting sensor, will be conducted for the occupancy-based controls (OBC) in both residential and commercial buildings.

        "dc:description": "Sensors are one of the fundamental components for sensor-rich controls in buildings but are prone to different errors. Existing studies show that sensor errors hold a place among top-priority faults in building systems. Before we take countermeasures to mitigate the sensor errors, it is vital to prioritize key sensors and quantify the collective impacts of concurrent sensor errors. In response to this, a simulation-based methodology is introduced to conduct a comprehensive sensor error impact analysis in building systems, which adds a stochastic sensor prioritization through a sensitivity analysis on top of a commonly used deterministic sensor error quantification. The synergies of these two parts help better interpret the sensor error impacts on building energy consumption, ventilation performance, thermal comfort, etc. A sensor-rich CO2-based Demand-Controlled Ventilation system is used as a case study to demonstrate the viability of the methodology as a proof-of-the-concept. The results show that the energy savings potential and ventilation performance are mostly influenced by the accuracy of the AHU outdoor airflow sensors. The accuracy of zone level airflow sensors has a negligible impact on both energy savings and ventilation performance. The accuracy of zone CO2 sensors has more influence on the ventilation performance compared with the accuracy of zone airflow sensors. Compared with the baseline case with zero errors, the largest deviation percentages could reach 16.90% and 94.32%, respectively, in terms of the Heating, Ventilation, and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) annual energy consumption and the Outdoor Air Ratio (OAR) when multiple key sensors suffer from normal error intensities simultaneously.",
