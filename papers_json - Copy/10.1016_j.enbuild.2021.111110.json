Yet service frameworks for small buildings to provide alerts automatically when a failure in energy conservation is detected have not been sufficiently investigated. Thus, we propose a framework for detecting energy faults based on peer comparison of operating time estimated by self-organizing maps from smart meter data with a coarse time resolution. The framework first defines a common operating status for the business type using the results of operating time estimation from multiple buildings of the same type, and then monitors the operating status at 1-h intervals using only a fault threshold parameter specified by the user. If each estimated operating status is judged to be significantly larger than the average level for the building type, the system identifies it as an energy fault. The results of case studies using an open building energy management system dataset suggest that the proposed framework can detect failures in energy conservation caused by inappropriate HVAC management, which usually results in higher contract power consumption, or by failure to turn off appliances that unnecessarily consume energy after business hours. Abbreviations AC air conditioning BEMS building energy management system HVAC heating, ventilation, and air conditioning SII Sustainable Open Innovation Initiative SOM self-organizing map SMEs small- and medium-sized enterprises Keywords Energy fault Electricity conservation Information provision Small buildings Smart meter data 1 Introduction As the adoption of smart meters becomes more widespread, the promotion of energy conservation by using electricity demand data is an increasingly important issue for electricity retailers. The time resolution of the smart meter data is usually from 15 min to 1 h, and is coarser than pulse data, which is on the order of hertz. Because insights extracted from such coarse raw energy consumption data are essentially limited, smart meter data analytics to extract further detailed insights is expected to add business value [1]. In this context, a wide variety of methods for smart meter data analysis that contributes to energy conservation services have been proposed [2\u20134]. Although no taxonomy has been established for application of smart meter data analytics, several approaches have been proposed from different perspectives. One taxonomy proposed 4 categories comprising load analysis, load forecasting, load management, and miscellaneous, which contains 13 subcategories [5]. A similar categorization focusing on applications for the building sector comprised load profiling, customer classification, and disaggregation [6]. Another categorization for industrial systems comprised fault detection, maintenance, transient stability analysis, device health monitoring, power quality monitoring, topology identification, renewable energy forecasting, load forecasting, load profiling, load disaggregation, and non-technical loss (usually theft) detection [4]. However, despite the growing number of smart meter data analytics for a wide variety of segments, the majority of the applications are for the residential sector or for load forecasting [7\u20139], load disaggregation [10\u201312], or load profiling [13\u201315], usually based on clustering algorithms. The implementations of smart meter data analytics for the business sector are relatively scarce. Furthermore, the number of case studies for small buildings is especially fewer than that for large enterprises. Some of the causes include limited human resources assigned to energy management, as well as insufficient information available for energy conservation measures in small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Energy audits are a conventional approach to help SMEs conserve energy; however, the coverage of these programs is limited owing to the high cost in terms of time and human resources [16]. Thus, services that automatically provide information based on smart meter data are expected to promote energy conservation in SMEs [6]. For such services, frameworks that send alerts when failure in energy conservation is detected via an artificial intelligence-based approach using smart meter data with coarse time resolutions of 30 min or 1 h have not been investigated. For such a service, this paper proposes a framework to detect energy faults statistically via peer comparison of operating status estimated by a method that uses self-organizing maps (SOMs) with smart meter data. Extracting insights from direct comparison of raw energy consumption data between buildings is usually difficult because building sizes vary greatly even if basic attributes such as business type are the same. Converting raw energy consumption data into a limited number of operating statuses (i.e., operating, half-operating, or non-operating) overcomes this problem and enables comparison of buildings that share the same energy consumption pattern. The proposed framework was designed for simple implementation and easy management by minimizing the number of control parameters and required data types. Users need to specify only one parameter for the sensitivity of fault detection. The only input data are master switch demand data acquired at 1-h intervals, and no other data, such as outdoor temperature or date, are required. This is realized by matching the business types and the recorded terms of the energy consumption data for the peer comparison. Performance of the proposed framework was evaluated using an open public building energy management system (BEMS) dataset. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 summarizes related work on fault detection for small buildings. In Section 3, we briefly review the concept of energy fault and define the target of our proposed fault detection framework. In Section 4, we introduce the structure of the proposed framework, which employs an operating time estimation method that we previously developed. In Section 5, we describe the test bed data and the calculation results of the proposed framework. Section 6 discusses the results, and Section 7 provides concluding remarks. 2 Related work Fault detection, sometimes also called anomaly detection [17], has been a major research subject for building energy management before the smart meter rollout. Most of the previous methods relied on data from individual appliances such as chillers, air conditioning (AC) equipment [18], and air handling units [19], which are finer than smart meter data that typically consist of coarse master switch demand data. Several taxonomies categorize computational techniques for building fault detection with data analysis. One taxonomy uses three categories, namely, quantitative model-based, qualitative model-based, and process history-based [20\u201322], but primarily the qualitative model-based category, especially rule-based methods [23]. Another taxonomy uses five categories, namely, detailed models, simplified models, rule- or physics-based models, and black or grey box and data-driven technologies [19]. Whereas these taxonomies have different perspectives on categorization, many case studies have focused on methods that can potentially be applied to detection of energy faults. To date, fault detection for small buildings based on smart meter data analytics has not been sufficiently investigated. One of the limited number of applications is based on real-time demand forecasting [24]. The method provided a dashboard application for smartphone web browsers that functions as an early warning system. The application uses the results of demand forecasting to give office occupants and building managers current energy consumption data and information on whether consumption is anomalous. The method requires additional sensors and data such as temperature. Furthermore, the time resolution of the smart meter data is 1 min, which is much finer than our proposed method. The high-spec features of this system design would make the installation and management more difficult than our proposed method, which requires only 1-h master switch demand data. Several simpler implementations use coarser smart meter data to compare daily load patterns with peer buildings and extract how the building deviates from the peers. For example, a method for detecting possibilities for mislabeled primary space use has been proposed [25]. This method first regularizes load patterns from pooled samples, then generates average load patterns for weekdays, weekends, or full weeks. The generated load patterns are finally divided into several groups using clustering, where the whole process relies solely on energy consumption data analysis. If the majority within a cluster represents the true primary use type of the buildings of the cluster, buildings with anomalous behavior can be detected based on whether the buildings belong to the cluster estimated as having the true label. Another method uses both smart meter data and human-labeled use type to enable fairer comparison for benchmarking [26]. First, load patterns are divided into several clusters to make typical load shapes. Then, a composition ratio of the typical load shape for each building is computed, and this ratio is again used for clustering to define several groups of buildings that share similar load patterns. The final groups for peer comparison are generated using both the clustering results and the use type labels, where anomalous buildings consuming relatively more energy can be detected by a bad ranking within the group. Another method estimates building characteristics, such as the use type, performance class, and general operation strategy [27], and uses a customized version of an existing method for smart meter data analysis [28]. This method, especially for estimating the performance class, can similarly identify how the relative energy consumption level of a target building compares within a group of buildings with the same use type, using indexes deduced from smart meter data. One method most similar to our proposed method first disaggregates AC demand using correlation analysis on daily energy consumption and outdoor temperature, and then detects faults based on comparison with other buildings in the same segment, with the energy consumption regularized by gross floor area [29]. The performance of the fault detection was compared with ground-truth data by expert energy auditors. All these existing methods based on smart meter data analytics use peer comparison to extract relative performance for energy consumption level or detect anomalous behavior. However, the extracted insights are inevitably general due to the comparison with aggregated levels of energy consumption (such as annual consumption). In contrast, because our proposed method can detect faults based on hourly data and the time resolution is much finer, the status of faults can be identified more specifically; users can know the season or time of the day during which faults tend to occur frequently, or how long the faults persist. The biggest advantage of our proposed method is that energy fault detection of this finer time resolution can be realized by a much simpler implementation and controlled by only one parameter, which makes it easy to use. Furthermore, our proposed method does not require outdoor temperature data, which enables it to detect a wider variety of faults, not only those caused by AC demand, but also by other factors, such as lighting demand. 3 Energy faults in small buildings \u201cEnergy fault\u201d is a well-known term that describes a concept for investigating energy conservation measures for offices. Previous definitions include \u201cthe deviation in operating performance of a process from its design or target performance\u201d [30] or \u201cunpermitted deviation of at least one characteristic property or parameter of the system from acceptable/unusual/standard condition\u201d [31]. These definitions are based on phenomenological discussions focusing on what is physically happening in offices. However, the level of abstraction is too high, and individual factors that cause energy faults are not sufficiently considered. Although one approach categorized the causes by discriminating whether they were identified [32,33], this approach accumulated every phenomenon heuristically, with a coverage that might potentially be insufficient. Other approaches exhaustively categorized analysis methods for detecting energy faults [19,20], all of which defined energy faults strictly in a mathematical form. However, they did not always correspond to concrete physical phenomena that cause energy faults. All these previous definitions share the same assumption that \u201cenergy fault\u201d means that current energy consumption is deviating from an optimized status that achieves ideal energy conservation. However, there has been no established approach for fault detection that considers both phenomenology and analysis methods for defining the optimal status. As smart meter data and a wide variety of sensor data from offices have become available in recent years, a framework that can systemize energy faults from both phenomenology and analysis methods would be beneficial for clarifying how opportunities for energy conservation are identified, including the type of data, their resolution, and the type of analysis. Thus, we analyze the energy faults as follows. We assume the status where ideal energy conservation is achieved as the one in which all the settings and management of energy-consuming appliances are optimized; that is, all the improvement measures proposed by detailed energy auditing have been implemented. Then, we define energy faults as energy consumption that has increased over the ideal level. Although the true values of energy faults are unknowable, we have a variety of analysis methods for estimating the values instead. Three structural factors influence the estimating accuracy: (a) whether the time granularity of data is high or low, (b) whether the variety of available data is large or small, and (c) whether previous consumption data of the target office or recent consumption data of other offices, that is, benchmarking, are available for comparison. For (a), consumption data with fine time granularity (hertz) can help to identify a wide variety of causes for energy faults precisely. Conversely, with coarse time granularity, such as in 30-min or hourly consumption data, identifying the concrete physical causes is more difficult. For (b), with more types of data available, energy faults can be identified more precisely. For example, energy consumption data, temperature data, or operating status data for each appliance could enable appliance-specific fault detection. Questionnaire responses from offices could also enable the consideration of measures other than energy conservation, such as comfort. For (c), if previous energy consumption data are available for an office that is already confirmed to have optimum conservation, these data can provide a benchmark for identifying opportunities for energy conservation. In the meantime, comparison of energy consumption data with those of other offices cannot sufficiently consider individual differences such as building performance, climate conditions, or building operation practices. However, it at least points out possible opportunities for energy conservation by comparing similar buildings. For (a), (b), and (c), there are advantages and disadvantages on handling richer data. One advantage is that a more detailed fault analysis can be performed. A disadvantage, however, is that costs for the data acquisition and data analysis will also increase. Because the data for each appliance are usually unique to a building or appliance, analytics using such finely detailed data are not realistic for many buildings. Based on these assumptions, our proposed method, which uses only smart meter data as input, can be viewed as follows: (a) the data time granularity is low, (b) the variety of input data is small, and (c) the standard for comparison is based on other buildings. Thus, the proposed method focuses on detecting energy conservation opportunities that are as easily implemented as possible, rather than identifying detailed causes for energy faults precisely. Our proposed framework is suitable for small buildings, for which available data are usually limited, in terms of scalability for applying the framework to a wider variety of targets. 4 Fault detection framework This section describes the design of our proposed framework for detecting energy faults step-by-step. First, in Section 4.1, we briefly describe how the input data are processed in three steps: data preprocessing, operating time estimation, and fault detection. In Section 4.2, we describe how the input data for analysis are extracted from an open dataset. Then, Section 4.3 briefly reviews an operating time estimation method using smart meter data from a single building, which regularizes consumption data into a small number of states and enables peer comparison between buildings with a variety of contract demand and gross floor area. Finally, Section 4.4 describes how statistical peer comparison of the operating time estimation results is used for the fault detection. 4.1 Overview Our proposed framework checks for energy faults hourly by comparing results of operating time estimation that we previously developed [34]. The comparison is statistically done within the same business type using the energy consumption data from the same time period (term). The proposed method has two features. One feature is that energy faults can be easily detected only with energy consumption data from multiple buildings as long as the term and the business type are identical. This means that other types of input data, such as outdoor temperature, are not required. The statistical comparison is applied not to the raw energy consumption data, but to the estimated operating status, which allows buildings with different sizes to be compared. Because the operating time estimation transforms the raw energy consumption data into one of three types of status (non-operating, half-operating, or operating), the fault detection is not affected by small demand variations caused by small events within a building, and instead only larger demand increases can be detected as faults. The other feature is that the number of control parameters is extremely reduced, which makes the method easy to use. The method has only one control parameter to function as a threshold for the p value used for the statistical comparison. Users do not have to be concerned about any other parameter or setting, but only the threshold that controls the sensitivity for the fault detection. Note that no alerting system can avoid the trade-off problem between frequency of false alerts and missed alerts, that is, recall and precision [35]. Because this trade-off is essentially a multi-objective problem, the balance must be determined manually. This means that the threshold parameter for the statistical comparison cannot be automated and inevitably must be set manually. Our proposed fault detection framework comprises three steps (Fig. 1 ). The first step (see Section 4.2) is the preparation of hourly electricity data for the same business type as the input data. The second step (see Section 4.3) is data preprocessing to estimate the operating time status of each office using an SOM-based method. In the third step (see Section 4.4), a statistical test is applied to determine whether each estimated operating status is higher than those of the other offices to detect whether the status is anomalous. 4.2 Data preprocessing To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we used an open BEMS dataset published by the Sustainable Open Innovation Initiative (SII) [36]. The open dataset is a collection of hourly demand data from over 5,000 customers in Japan. Each customer\u2019s electricity consumption data comprise master switch demand and up to six different types of demand, including AC, lighting, power, electric lamps, refrigeration/cryogenics, and others. All data are recorded in the format of kilowatt-hours per hour, and the minimum unit of measurement is 1 kWh/h. The basic attributes of this dataset are described in a previous analysis [34]. Although the website and labels of the dataset are written only in Japanese, the structure is simple enough to complete registration and data interpretation with help from machine translation. Registered users can use the dataset for research purposes as long as they follow the Terms of Use 1 1 The Terms of Use for the SII open BEMS dataset, as retrieved and translated from https://www.ems-opendata.jp/Common/pdf/koukai_manual.pdf , are: Please contact SII in advance if you wish to reprint or quote the deliverables created by analyzing the data. In this case, please specify the source (\u201cWe used SII Energy Management Open Data,\u201d for example). Please contact SII in advance if you would like to make a presentation at an academic conference or to publish an academic paper using the data. Users can register at https://www.ems-opendata.jp/dataset/Form and also contact SII through an inquiry form at https://www.ems-opendata.jp/dataset/Contact . . Because the SII dataset consists of electricity consumption data from a wide variety of business types, we extracted data from office buildings to evaluate the proposed method. For extraction, we applied the following conditions to the dataset: \u2022 Absolute difference in master switch demand and sum of the demand by use where AC demand is recorded as less than 3 kWh and 5% of total demand per year. \u2022 Refrigeration and cryogenic demand are excluded. We assumed the first condition to filter out unreliable energy consumption data because the large difference between the master switch demand and the sum of the demand by use category suggests recording errors. The second condition excluded customers with large refrigeration facilities, such as supermarkets and convenience stores. This filtering might be difficult in real-world energy management because information about whether an office building has refrigeration facilities is usually inaccessible. Nevertheless, office buildings without refrigeration and cryogenic demand data are our targets, given the limitations of the proposed method. The extracted datasets were subdivided into groups with the same business types and recorded terms. This grouping avoids meaningless comparison between different energy consumption patterns. Especially, grouping the same recorded terms is helpful for comparing energy consumption data with the same timing, avoiding the need for adjustment with calendar data. 4.3 Operating time estimation The prepared input data are preprocessed using an operating time estimation method [34]. The hourly demand data for a single customer is categorized into several clusters using a combination of SOMs [37] and k-means clustering to estimate the operating status with only hourly data (Fig. 1). The method automatically determines the operating status, Copt , which is represented by a number in the range 1 to 3. The estimation results are interpreted as follows: Copt of 1 means the building operates 24 h/day throughout the year, Copt of 2 means the year comprises operating/non-operating time, and Copt of 3 means the year comprises operating/half-operating/non-operating time. Our fault detection framework compares estimated operating times from multiple buildings, where a target building is estimated as operating when the operating status is judged as significantly more active than most of the buildings used as input. For this comparison, the estimated results are regularized so that the operating time is always 1, non-operating time is 0, and half-operating is 0.5 when Copt is 3. We excluded buildings with Copt of 1, which suggests that consumption within the building does not vary as clearly as the consumption in other buildings. 4.4 Fault detection based on peer comparison A simple statistical test is applied to the results of operating time estimation (described in Section 4.2) per group (same business type and recorded term) to detect energy faults in each building. For the hourly electricity consumption data of each building, the estimated operating status of the data is judged as a fault if the median of the difference from all the data in the same time period is found to be significantly larger than 0 by the signed rank test, that is, a statistically significant increase of the operating status from the average for the business type. The threshold for p value for the one-sided signed rank test, which we define as pthr , must be manually specified by the users to control sensitivity for this fault detection. This is the only parameter that users need to specify in our fault detection framework. 5 Results This section describes how we prepared the input data, along with output from our proposed fault detection method. First, Section 5.1 describes our evaluation policy for the input data and how we refer to the data for validation. Section 5.2 describes the basic attributes of extracted data to which our proposed method is applied. Then, Section 5.3 presents average operating patterns for five extracted business types. In Section 5.4, we explore how only the control parameter pthr affects the frequency of fault detection by the extracted business type. Section 5.5 presents case studies that provide examples of the output for typical buildings by business type and compares the output with actual consumption data. Finally, in Section 5.6, we present the average frequency of detected faults by time of day and business type, to investigate how fault detection patterns differ between business types. 5.1 Evaluation policy Performance of the proposed method was evaluated using an open BEMS dataset (described in Section 4.2). Although this dataset includes consumption data by use, we use only master switch demand for energy fault detection. While the proposed fault detection method does not use consumption data by use as input data, we use the consumption data for AC and lighting in the ex-post evaluation of the detected faults. In the performance analysis, for buildings where the two types of consumption data by use are recorded, we analyzed the validity of the detected faults qualitatively by investigating each demand by use. 5.2 Input data The proposed method needs as much data as possible for peer comparison. Thus, we counted the number of data points (buildings) for each group sharing the same business type and recorded term (Table 1 ). From these datasets, we chose one group per business type whose sample size is the largest within each business type for the performance analysis, which is highlighted with bold text in Table 1. The wide range of contract demand and floor area of each dataset suggests that sizes of the buildings greatly vary even if they are in the same group. Using these subdivided datasets, Section 5.3 presents the average operating pattern for each business type. Section 5.4 presents the results of sensitivity analysis on how the frequency of detected faults changes depending on the threshold parameter pthr . Section 5.5 presents case studies for five buildings from each business type focusing on the typical patterns of detected faults. Section 5.6 presents the frequency of detected faults per time of day for each business type. 5.3 Average operating status We applied the operating status estimation method to the five datasets identified in Table 1. Then we averaged the results of the estimated operating status for each business type (Fig. 2 ). Although it is usually difficult to extract meaningful insights from averaged raw energy consumption data due to a wide variety of building sizes, the average results of estimated operating status ranging from 0 to 1 are helpful for visualizing the typical operating pattern of each business type. For Insurance, the average level of daily operating status decreased during every weekend, the year-end and New Year holidays, and the Obon holiday week (a long summer vacation season in Japan). The typical pattern for weekdays was that the buildings started to operate around 6 AM and closed around 9 PM. The level of operating status also increased at midnight slightly during summer and winter. For Restaurants, the typical pattern was that they were not operating from 6 AM to 8 AM, the operating status level gradually increased after 9AM to operating, and then the level gradually decreased from 2 AM to 5 AM. The operating time started earlier during summer than it did during other seasons. Whereas the daily operating status had a short-term decrease during New Year holidays, the other seasons had no non-operating days. For Entertainment, the operating time started around 7 AM and ended around 10 PM. The starting time became earlier in summer and around New Year holidays in comparison to other seasons. No non-operating days were observed throughout the year. For Retail (Product), the operating time started around 6 AM and ended around 9 PM. Although the starting time was later some days and the ending time was earlier than usual, no non-operating days were observed throughout the year. For Retail (Other), the level of operating status was relatively higher than that of the other business types throughout the year and no non-operating days were observed. The level of operating status decreased from 1 AM to 6 AM. The operating time maintained a level of around 0.4 during winter. These results suggest that typical operating patterns of a variety of business types can be represented by averaging the estimated operating status of identical business types and recorded terms, even though the operating patterns are totally different per business type. 5.4 Sensitivity analysis Fault detection offers energy managers opportunities to increase energy conservation. However, if too many faults are reported, the energy managers cannot check the causes of all the alerts. Meanwhile, they cannot consider measures for energy conservation if too few faults are reported, because it will be difficult to identify trends such as time of the day or season when the faults are frequently detected. Thus, the frequency of fault reporting should be moderate. The sensitivity of the fault detection is determined by the pthr in the statistical test, meaning that the frequency of detected faults can be controlled by setting the threshold for the p value. Thus, we conducted sensitivity analysis to decrease pthr gradually and find the values at which the number of detected faults reaches 0 for each dataset. Fig. 3 shows the relationship between pthr and the total number of detected faults per business type. It is natural that the value of pthr at which 0 faults are detected decreases as the number of samples increases. The value is the lowest for Insurance among the five groups. The results show that the values of pthr at which no fault is detected are pthr = 1.0 × 10−40 for Insurance, pthr = 1.0 × 10−10 for Restaurants, pthr = 0.0001 for Entertainment, pthr = 1.0 × 10−6 for Retail (Product), and pthr = 1.0 × 10−10 for Retail (Other). Of course, the accuracy of this parameter survey can be improved by using a finer step for pthr . At a minimum, the values can be considered as the upper limits for each dataset for detecting no energy fault. Thus, users of the proposed method need to control pthr to obtain their desired frequency of detected faults, because the same value of pthr gives a different fault frequency depending on the dataset. 5.5 Case studies In Section 5.4, we ascertained that the total number of detected faults decreased as pthr decreased, regardless of business type. Based on the results, this section presents five case studies, one for each business type. We set pthr to the values where the total number of detected faults are marginally larger than 0, to detect a moderate number of faults. We set pthr = 1.0 × 10−30 for Insurance, pthr = 1.0 × 10−7 for Restaurants, pthr = 0.001 for Entertainment, pthr = 1.0 × 10−5 for Retail (Product), and pthr = 1.0 × 10−7 for Retail (Other). Among the five case studies, only B11006404 (Restaurants) and B11003584 (Entertainment) have AC and lighting demand data. Thus, we evaluated the validity of the proposed method for these two building groups by comparing the detected faults and the two types of energy consumption data by use. 5.5.1 Insurance Fig. 4 shows the master switch demand, the estimated operating time, and the detected faults of B11000163. The basic attributes are shown in Table 2 . The estimated operating time, which generally starts around 6 AM and ends around 8 PM, shows that a cyclic decrease of the operating status level is evident every weekend. Although the operating status level decreases during in the daytime around October, November, New Year holidays, and the Obon holiday week, most of these levels are judged as half-operating. Occasionally, operating and half-operating time continues until midnight. Especially, the half-operating time through midnight is seen for a few weeks in early summer. As for the detected faults, the starting demand estimated as operating at 7 AM on weekdays is partly detected as faults during the year. Some faults are detected in daytime, although the number is relatively small. In early summer, the frequency of faults increases in the afternoon, and a long half-operating time is detected as faults for some weeks at midnight. Also, on two days, the operating time continued from the afternoon to the morning, both of which are identified as faults. 5.5.2 Restaurants Fig. 5 shows the master switch demand, the estimated operating time, the detected faults, actual AC demand, and actual lighting demand of B11006404. The basic attributes are shown in Table 3 . The estimation result suggests that the operating time starts in the afternoon and ends around 2 AM. Most of the time, 3 AM to 12 PM is estimated as non-operating, though those times of the day are estimated as half-operating from February to March. From April to January, the starting time is earlier in summer than in winter, and the earlier starting time is estimated as half-operating. As for the detected faults, while 2 AM to 2 PM is estimated as half-operating almost constantly in February and March, only a part of the time period, 6 AM to 8 AM, is detected as faults. This result reflects the average operating pattern for Restaurants, where 6 AM to 8AM is normally non-operating (Fig. 2). These faults are considered to be caused by constant heating demand during non-business hours. Actually, the main energy consumption during this time is AC demand (Fig. 5). In months other than February and March, some faults are also detected between 6 AM and 8 AM by the demand that continued from midnight, mainly in summer. To investigate the cause of these detected faults, we focus on the balance of AC and lighting demand in Figures 10 and 11. The cooling demand from 6 AM to 8 AM is smaller in summer compared with the heating demand in winter, but larger than 0. The lighting demand from 6 AM to 8 AM is larger in summer compared with winter. Thus, the detected faults from 6 AM to 8 AM in months other than February and March could be caused by the combination of both AC and lighting demand, rather than either of them separately. 5.5.3 Entertainment Fig. 6 shows the master switch demand, the estimated operating time, and the detected faults of B11003584. The basic attributes are shown in Table 4 . The estimation result suggests that the operating time starts around 6 AM and ends around 11 PM. On several days throughout the year, half-operating or operating time continues until midnight. As for the detected faults, because the typical operating time for Entertainment is from 6 AM to 11 PM (Fig. 2), most of the detected faults are caused by a half-operating or operating status in other time periods, mainly from 1 AM to 5 AM. More precisely, these faults are caused by AC and lighting demand sustained during non-business hours (Fig. 6). Especially, October has some days when continuous half-operating time from 0 AM to 6 AM is detected as faults due to continuous lighting demand during this time. Also, from 11 PM to 0 AM, part of the time period estimated as operating is detected as faults. It is noteworthy that the starting time is earlier and the ending time is later in summer than in the other seasons. This seasonal change corresponds to the change of starting and ending times of the AC demand. Because this trend is observed in the other Entertainment buildings, it appears to have no influence on fault detection around the starting and ending times. 5.5.4 Retail (Product) Fig. 7 shows the master switch demand, the estimated operating time, and the detected faults of B11006136. The basic attributes are shown in Table 5 . The estimation result suggests that the operating time starts around 8 AM and ends around 9 PM. On several days throughout the year, half-operating or operating time is sustained until midnight in this business type. The average operating hours for this business type are from 6 AM to 9 PM (Fig. 2). Because the level of operating status is usually low at 9 PM in other buildings, 9 PM is estimated as operating for most days throughout the year. This causes frequently detected faults at 9 PM throughout the year (Fig. 7). The other detected faults are caused by half-operating or operating levels at midnight. 5.5.5 Retail (Other) Fig. 8 shows the master switch demand, the estimated operating time, and the detected faults of B11005402. The basic attributes are shown in Table 6 . The estimation result suggests that the operating time starts around 8 AM and ends around 9 PM from May to the middle of October. In the other months, most of the time period from 10 PM to 7 AM is estimated as half-operating or operating. While the typical operating pattern for this business type is that the operating status level is low around 1 AM to 6 AM (Fig. 2), the level remains at an operating or half-operating level even at midnight in winter in B11005402 (Fig. 8). Most of the detected faults are caused by this higher operating status at midnight in winter. In contrast, no faults are detected from 8 AM to midnight throughout the year. 5.6 Hourly fault frequency Fig. 9 shows the ratios of detected faults per time period for each business type. The pthr for each business type was set so that the number of detected faults is marginally larger than 0, as given in Section 5. The distribution of time periods when faults are frequently detected are clearly different among the five business types. For insurance, whereas the ratio is small but larger than 0 from 6 AM to 8 PM, the number of detected faults is relatively larger in other time periods, which are considered to be non-business hours. These faults detected during daytime are caused by a part of the buildings operating on weekends or holidays, when the buildings are usually closed. For Restaurants, the ratio is 0 from 11 AM to 3 AM, and faults are mainly observed from 4 AM to 10 AM. Although the causes for the detected faults could be preparation for business opening or electric appliances left on, this cannot be distinguished with the data used. For Entertainment, faults are not detected from 7 AM to 10 PM, which is considered to be business hours. The detected faults are observed in other time periods. For Retail (Product), no faults are detected from 8 AM to 8 PM, which is considered to be business hours. In the other time periods, the detected faults are most frequently observed around 9 PM and the frequency gradually decreases until 7 AM. For Retail (Other), no faults are detected from 9 AM to 11 PM, which is considered to be business hours. Faults are detected in the other time periods, where the frequency of faults increases in the middle of the non-business hours, around 1 AM to 7 AM. 6 Discussion Because our proposed fault detection framework is based on statistical analysis, the statistical variance of the estimation can be decreased using more samples of building energy consumption data. The results in Section 5.6 show larger error bars for hourly fault frequency in Entertainment (11 samples) and Retail (Other) (33 samples) than that in Insurance (118 samples). Nonetheless, the Entertainment case study shows that the results of the fault detection can be sufficiently meaningful as long as the energy consumption patterns are similar, even if the number of samples is relatively small, such as 10 or so. Meanwhile, most of the energy consumption patterns within the same business type are similar in the SII dataset that we used for the analysis, which appears to be obtained from stores of the same chain. If data are obtained from a different chain, it might be difficult to obtain meaningful fault detection results from a sample size as small as 10. Our proposed framework detects significant increases compared with a typical energy consumption pattern for each business type, using only master switch demand data. Therefore, when used alone, our proposed method cannot unveil circumstances of an individual building to determine whether the detected faults are real energy faults or energy consumption necessary for their business that triggers a fault by chance. On-site inspections by expert energy auditors or more detailed data of the building would be needed to obtain information about such detailed circumstances. Nevertheless, the merit of the proposed framework, which works as a preprocessing step for the energy audit, is to point out the possibilities of energy faults as easily as possible. The framework only focuses on abnormal electricity consumption based on the common operating status for each time period estimated from data of multiple buildings. Thus, no fault would be detected if all the input data were obtained from buildings that fail to conserve energy at the same time, even if an actual energy conservation failure occurred in the target building. However, the results of our case studies showed that the framework has the potential to detect common patterns of energy faults caused by inappropriate heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) management or failure to turn off electric appliances that unnecessarily consume energy after business hours. Electricity consumption data are usually so noisy that it would be difficult to extract valuable insights by directly comparing the raw time-series data. Meanwhile, our SOM-based method, which is used for preprocessing, estimates operating status considering its context, whether the consumption level is excessively high for the day or for the period of time in a single building. Comparing multiple buildings using the data regularized into a small number of discrete states for operating status, rather than the noisy raw data, was shown to effectively identify unusual energy consumption as faults. Although our proposed method assumes that the labels for business types are correct, this is not always the case. They could be mislabeled by human error, or the building might be mixed-use even if the data label was an office [25]. Especially, mixed-use buildings have a wider variety of load patterns, due to the lack of energy efficiency guidelines [38] or unpredictable characteristics of consumption [39]. For example, case studies on higher-education buildings revealed that mixed-use buildings showed the largest standard deviation of total energy consumption [40]. Furthermore, sometimes even data centers can be labeled as mixed use [41]. It is natural that, if these uncommon load patterns are pooled together, the anomalous data deviating from an average will be detected as faults, as long as the other data share similar load patterns. Even necessary energy consumption will be more likely to be detected as faults, especially in the case that the target building is estimated as operating while the majority of the building pool is estimated as non-operating. One approach to overcome this limitation as a future work could be using clustering techniques to make groups for peer comparison instead of human-labeled business types. An example could be hierarchical categorization based on automated attribute extraction [42]. This kind of approach to exclude data that are apparently inappropriate for peer comparison could be helpful for filling the gap between the human-labeled business types and the actual load patterns. Another more manual and simpler approach would be for users to conduct fault detection once using our proposed method, and then exclude samples showing apparently too many faults or having many detected faults in load patterns where the faults can be clearly judged as non-faults. Users can also run our proposed method pooling samples labeled as mixed use. However, note that faults will be less likely to be detected in this case because the variance of operating time estimation results will be larger than those for the other use types or business types. 7 Conclusion We developed a framework for detecting abnormal energy consumption in small buildings using only smart meter data. The proposed framework first estimates the hourly operating status of multiple buildings with similar business operations. Then, the result of operating time estimation for each building is statistically compared with that of other buildings. If the hourly operating status level is significantly higher than the average operating status level for the business type, then it is identified as an energy fault. We applied this framework to hourly energy consumption data extracted from the SII open BEMS dataset. The results show that abnormal demand data, which are considered to be caused by inappropriate HVAC management, failure to turn off electric appliances, or energy consumption outside business hours, are detected as energy faults. The limitation of the proposed framework is that it requires a set of energy consumption data from about 10 buildings with similar consumption patterns. Most offices usually have basic attribution data from smart meters, which can be used for reasonable peer comparison, as we grouped buildings by business types in the SII BEMS dataset. However, this kind of data labeling does not always represent the energy consumption pattern properly, due to manual labeling that sometimes requires subjective judgements of building attributes or human error in data input. Hence, the results of the fault detection inevitably depend on the quality of the input data. This means that securing data for multiple buildings for the same business type is not sufficient input. The users also have to be aware of the actual similarity of their building to the energy consumption data to ensure high-quality fault detection. Although we used the operating time estimation as a preprocessing method for the proposed fault detection, this method alone could also have other uses. One such application could be property management to clarify actual starting and ending times of business hours. If the actual business hours deviate from the original company policy, the information extracted from the operating time estimation could be used for business improvement. Another application could be human resource management. Because the results of operating time estimation can detect someone working in the building outside business hours, this information could help to clarify the actual working hours, which sometimes exceed regular working hours defined by company policy, and to reduce overworking.

        "dc:description": "As the penetration of smart meters grows, new energy conservation services using electricity consumption data have drawn much attention. Yet service frameworks for small buildings to provide alerts automatically when a failure in energy conservation is detected have not been sufficiently investigated. Thus, we propose a framework for detecting energy faults based on peer comparison of operating time estimated by self-organizing maps from smart meter data with a coarse time resolution. The framework first defines a common operating status for the business type using the results of operating time estimation from multiple buildings of the same type, and then monitors the operating status at 1-h intervals using only a fault threshold parameter specified by the user. If each estimated operating status is judged to be significantly larger than the average level for the building type, the system identifies it as an energy fault. The results of case studies using an open building energy management system dataset suggest that the proposed framework can detect failures in energy conservation caused by inappropriate HVAC management, which usually results in higher contract power consumption, or by failure to turn off appliances that unnecessarily consume energy after business hours.",
