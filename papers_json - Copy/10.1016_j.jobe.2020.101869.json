In recent years, various heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) control strategies have been proposed to reduce buildings\u2019 energy consumption and environmental impacts. Due to different research designs, it is impossible to directly compare the reported performance of these strategies and determine the best approach for operating real-world buildings. To fill this gap, this research uses a well-validated building simulation model to holistically evaluate the performance of 12 existing HVAC cooling strategies in reducing the total cooling energy use, peak demand, and cooling energy cost. The findings include: i) The ON/OFF and night setup control strategies could lead to even higher energy cost than the 24/7 operation baseline; ii) demand-limiting control methods performed well across the three energy performance metrics and achieved the highest energy reduction ratios ranging from 9.8% to 10.5%; iii) precooling and extended precooling reduced the peak load most significantly by 15.4% and 21.4%, respectively; and iv) the resistive-capacitive (RC) network-based precooling optimization resulted in the highest electricity cost savings with reduction ratios of 16.6% and 12.9%, based on the two common price schedules. Besides providing valuable insights to the research community, this study offers a practical method to help building operators analyze and select the best HVAC control strategies for their energy management goals. Keywords Heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) Cooling Energy consumption Peak demand Energy cost Building simulation Validation 1 Introduction The heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) system consumes around 40% of total energy used in a building [1]. It is essential for an efficiently operated HVAC system to not only maintain comfortable and healthy indoor environments but also reduce energy consumption. In recent years, issues related to buildings' peak demand (often associated with cooling) have received increasing attention from researchers and practitioners. This is because high peak loads add a significant burden to the power generation system and the grid [2] while creating serious environmental sustainability concerns [3]. To limit high peak loads and flatten the demand curve, many electric utility companies have either imposed higher electricity rates during peak periods or incorporated demand charges in buildings\u2019 electricity bills. Such financial penalties are expected to motivate building operators to carefully manage their peak demands [4]. So far numerous HVAC control strategies have been proposed to lower buildings' cooling energy use, peak demand, or related energy cost. Studies on simple night setback/setup (NS) control demonstrated energy use reductions up to 23% [5,6]; however, the strategy's potential influence on peak load and energy cost was not well understood. Researchers working on the reduction of peak load often took heuristic approaches. For example, Yin et al. [7] and Haniff et al. [8] used three HVAC demand-limiting (DL) control schemes, termed concave-increasing, step-up, and linear-up, to gradually reduce the peak time HVAC energy input. This resulted in a peak load reduction of up to 20%. The model-based predictive control (MPC) approach, also known as receding horizon control [4,9], represents a more sophisticated heuristic method for minimizing energy use or electricity cost. This could lead to savings up to 25% and 30%, respectively [10,11]. Still, none of these heuristic techniques guarantees an optimal solution. Recent years have seen advances in developing mathematical optimization techniques to reduce peak demand and energy cost. In Ref. [12], three optimization methods, namely semi-analytical, exponential setpoint equation-based semi-analytical, and load weighted-average, were studied to determine the trajectories of peak time setpoint temperatures. These DL optimization techniques were able to decrease the peak load by up to 50% while reducing the energy cost by up to 12%, as shown in Ref. [8,13]. With an improved understanding that building thermal mass can help shift the HVAC load from the peak to the off-peak period, researchers started to develop precooling strategies [7,14]. Additionally, Lee and Braun [13] combined their DL optimization methods with precooling to further reduce the peak cooling load. However, their work omitted cooling schedules during the off-peak time. More recently, Shi et al. [15] proposed a resistive-capacitive (RC) network-based mathematical model for multi-zone HVAC precooling optimization (RCPC). This work considered cooling schedules in both peak and non-peak periods and achieved cooling energy cost savings ranging from 5% to 20%. Various methods that have been used to predict HVAC systems\u2019 response to proposed control strategies and their resulting energy performance include, but are not limited to, simplified physical models [16,17], prediction algorithms [18,19], black-box models (e.g., neural networks) [20,21], and software-based building simulation [22,23]. When feasible, field measurements are also used for performance verification [24,25]. Each of these methods has its own characteristics and inherent limitations, causing variations in the reported performance levels. Also, different studies had different research designs due to differences in the objectives of the proposed control strategies, capacity limitations of the chosen HVAC systems, performance baselines, etc. All of these make direct comparison of reported performance levels invalid when identifying the best approach to operating real-world buildings. Previous comparative studies on HVAC control strategies are not without limitations. Most of these studies (e.g., Ref. [13,26]) only compared a limited number of strategies (i.e., between three and five). Also, comparisons were often based on one or two selected performance criteria, such as energy savings, peak load reduction, and energy cost savings [4,8]. Thus, it is unlikely that limitations and trade-offs associated with each strategy were fully evaluated. In some comparisons (e.g., Refs. [7,27]), the chosen control strategies did not reach their full potential due to various factors. For example, missing a proper process to determine the ideal precooling temperature and starting time may impair reliability and accuracy in the comparison results. To address these issues and bridge the gap between research and practice, this study aimed to provide a highly reliable and comprehensive comparison of a broader range of HVAC cooling strategies to facilitate the analysis-based decision-making process for real-world building operations. The study has several distinct advantages over other comparative studies in the literature. First, the number of strategies included in the side-by-side comparisons (a total of 12) far exceeded existing studies, providing greater insight into selecting the best HVAC cooling strategy. Second, these comparisons were based on a detailed building simulation model that was well validated by experimental investigation in predicting both building energy use and thermal behavior. Compared to other response prediction approaches, the software-based simulation method was able to offer more accurate predictions of building indoor air temperature, humidity, and energy use in response to the chosen strategies [28]. The simulation results generated in this study can further enhance the credibility and acceptance of some state-of-the-art methods. For example, the performance of the newly proposed RCPC strategy was only previously verified by numerical simulation based on computer-generated random building samples. The results will also help convince building operators that the predicted energy or utility cost savings can be achieved under guaranteed thermal comfort and alleviate their concerns about potential hot/cold occupant complaints. Third, by running additional simulations to determine the ideal setup temperature (i.e., higher cooling setpoint temperature during unoccupied periods), precooling temperature, and precooling starting time for the examined HVAC strategies, this study compared their full capability to reduce cooling energy use, peak demand, and energy cost while still achieving thermal comfort, covering all main performance metrics in building energy management. Overall, this study will contribute substantially to the implementation of advanced cooling strategies. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the model development and validation process; Section 3 presents the implementation steps for the compared HVAC operating strategies; Section 4 compares the performance of these strategies and discusses research findings; and Section 5 concludes this paper. 2 Model development and validation 2.1 Building and system description The case study building is the nine-story New Dreese Laboratory (NDL) located on the Columbus campus of The Ohio State University at 40.0 N ∘ , 83.0 W ∘ . This region has a humid continental climate with strong seasonality. The coldest month is January when the average overnight temperature is − 6.5 ° C , and the warmest month is July with an average daytime temperature of 29.6 C ∘ . The normal annual Heating Degree Days and Cooling Degree Days are 5546 and 925 (base 18 ° C ), respectively. The building was constructed in 1994, with a total gross floor area of 7030 m2 and an occupied/conditioned area of 6358 m2. It has approximately 200 rooms, which serve as classrooms, conference rooms, offices, laboratories, and a computer center. Table 1 lists some major building and system parameter values for the NDL (e.g., thermal properties of building assemblies, occupancy, lighting and plug loads), which have been verified using the information collected from the building audit, operator interviews, and building plans. The building is served by two Variable Air Volume (VAV) Air Handler Units (AHUs) with a terminal reheat system for cooling and/or supplemental heating. It uses a chiller to supply chilled water and is also connected to the campus chilled water system. Space heating is mainly provided by the hot water radiation system. Campus steam is used for heating hot water and domestic hot water. Both chilled water and steam are produced by the McCracken Power Plant. The building's electricity comes from American Electric Power (AEP). The temperature setpoint for this building is kept at 22.5 °C for 24 h a day, 7 days a week (24/7), which is the baseline case used in this study. The HVAC system control is based on feedback from sensors in selected sample rooms. Accordingly, the AHU supply air temperatures are reset between 12.8 °C and 18.3 °C. For example, AHU-1 collects data from rooms 127, 422, and 622. In Summer Mode, the highest temperature reading from these three zones is compared to a common zone setpoint of 22.5 °C. Based on how far away from setpoint the warmest zone is, the supply air setpoint will be adjusted. The closer the warmest zone temperature is to 22.5 °C the supply air setpoint will be closer to 18.3 °C and the farther away from 22.5 °C the supply air setpoint will be closer to 12.8 °C. In Winter Mode, the lowest reading from these three zones is compared to the setpoint of 22.5 °C. The closer the coldest zone temperature is to 22.5 °C the supply air setpoint will be closer to 12.8 °C and the farther away from 22.5 °C the supply air setpoint will be closer to 18.3 °C. AHU-2 operates exactly the same way but based on three different sample rooms. According to Ref. [29], resetting supply air temperature based on internal/external conditions could reduce fan, cooling, and heating (reheat at the zone level) energy consumption while improving thermal comfort. 2.2 Model development The DesignBuilder (DB) software tool was used for computer-based simulation. Nine building blocks (including walls, roofs, floor slabs, etc.) were created to represent the nine floors of the NDL building. Component blocks were used to simulate the adjacent building, which has shading and reflection effects on the NDL. Fig. 1 illustrates the model creating process. In this model, each room is considered a zone unit. Based on the HVAC system plans, all the rooms in the building are clustered into Zone Groups 1 and 2, served by AHU-1 and AHU-2, respectively. To reduce the complexity in modeling the supply air temperature reset schedule, this study fixed the supply air temperature at 13.5 °C instead of varying from 12.8 °C to 18.3 °C. In practice, it is very common for conventional VAV systems to be designed and set up to supply air at constant temperature (e.g., 12.8 °C) to maintain the zone temperature setpoints and reasonable indoor humidity levels. Besides the two AHUs, four other loops were modeled for this building: 1) the Hot Water (HW) Loop: Using a gas-fired condensing boiler with thermal efficiency of 0.89 to supply 75 °C hot water to the heating coils in the AHUs, terminal boxes, and the radiation heating system; 2) the Domestic Hot Water (DHW) Loop: Including a hydraulic water heater that extracts the heat from the HW loop to provide DHW for the building; 3) the Chilled Water (CHW) Loop: Containing a chiller with a coefficient of performance rating of 5.5 to produce the chilled water for the cooling coils in the AHUs; and 4) the Condenser Loop. The zone-level occupancy, lighting and plug loads data was entered into the model. 2.3 Model calibration and validation Once the building was constructed in DB, the simulation model was calibrated and validated using the actual metered utility data and measured indoor temperature data. During the calibration, researchers manually tuned or refined some physical characteristics of the NDL building (including airtightness, materials for construction assemblies, actual uses of rooms and internal gains, etc.) while comparing simulation results with measured data. When it came to the configuration of HVAC system and building operations, researchers examined the correctness of data sources and control strategies and schedules with engineers and technicians of the Building Automation Office and McCracken Power Plant. The model was iterated multiple times and the revision history was recorded. Since steam and chilled water were not metered at the NDL, the calibration and validation of building energy simulation in this study only included the electricity used for space cooling of the computer center (served by five distinct air-conditioning units), lighting, interior equipment, pumps, fans, etc. based on monthly utility data during a period of one year. The third typical meteorological year (TMY3) weather data for the same location and time period was used in simulation. Table 2 shows the comparison between the calibrated energy simulation results and field-measured monthly electricity consumption. The mean bias error ( M B E M o n t h ) and coefficient of variation of root mean squared error ( C V ( R M S E M o n t h ) ) calculated based on Eqs. (1) and (2) are 0.50% and 7.66%, respectively. This is in compliance with ASHARE Guideline 14\u20132002 [30] and the Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) [31]. (1) M B E M o n t h ( % ) = ∑ i = 1 N ( S i − M i ) ∑ i = 1 N ( M i ) × 100 , (2) C V ( R M S E M o n t h ) ( % ) = 1 N ∑ i = 1 N ( S i − M i ) 2 M \u203e × 100 , where M i and S i denote the measured and simulated monthly energy use in kWh in real situations (RS) and DB during the month i , respectively; N is the total number of months during the simulation period; and M \u203e is the mean of monthly measured energy use. Since there is no standard to validate thermal performance simulation, this study considers the prediction accuracy to be acceptable if the mean absolute error (MAE) is within 2 °C or the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is within 15%, as seen in Ref. [32,33]. The measurement data was obtained from an earlier study [34], where the indoor air temperature of 84 rooms in the NDL building was measured from June 2010 to May 2011. The validation was conducted for both the summertime (Jul. 01, 2010~Aug. 31, 2010) and the wintertime (Dec. 01, 2010~Jan. 31, 2011), representing the cooling and heating conditions. Eqs. (3) and (4) were used to calculate MAE and MAPE, respectively. (3) M A E = 1 N ∑ t = 1 N | A t − F t | , (4) M A P E = 1 N ∑ t = 1 N | A t − F t A t | , where A t and F t denote the actual and forecast room temperatures at time instant t in RS and DB, respectively; and N is the total number of the fitted points during the simulation period. In the simulation, the predicted temperatures for individual zones are all close to the setpoint temperature used for the HVAC control, indicating that the original HVAC system for this building was properly designed. The validation found that 23 and 19 out of 84 rooms did not meet the requirement of MAE or MAPE during the summer and winter, respectively. However, the rooms that did not meet the requirements were all persistently ill-conditioned (persistently hot or persistently cold) according to the measurement data. These abnormal conditions were likely caused by maintenance or operational issues (e.g., broken parts in the HVAC system and improper damper positions at terminal boxes), which cannot often be captured by simulation. The comparisons of the whole building temperature (i.e., the calculated average temperature of 84 rooms in the building) showed a strong agreement between the measured and simulated temperatures in both summer and winter. The MAE and MAPE of the whole building temperature in summer (0.63 °C and 2.85%) and winter (0.80 °C and 3.64%) all met the validation requirements. Examples of temperature comparison between RS and DB are illustrated in Fig. 2 . The validation results suggest that in general the current HVAC system effectively maintains the building's indoor air temperatures based on the chosen setpoints, and the DB model accurately represents the indoor thermal conditions of the case study building. This is critical since the peak load shifting and precooling strategies examined in this study usually allow setpoint temperatures to fluctuate between the lower bound and upper bound of the human comfort zone. Under such circumstances, indoor air temperatures need to be maintained more precisely to avoid thermal comfort problems. 3 Implementation of HVAC control strategies 3.1 Concepts and control parameter values Besides the HVAC control strategy currently used by the building (the baseline), 11 additional HVAC control strategies were implemented on the validated model. These include the ON/OFF control (shutting off systems during unoccupied periods), night setup (NS) control, DL control (six schemes), precooling (PC), extended precooling (EPC), and the RC network-based precooling optimization (RCPC). The MPC approach was not included in the comparison for two reasons. First, MPC is a general framework to handle uncertainties in process control, where optimization over a time-horizon (e.g., a day) is performed in each time slot (e.g., every hour) by taking future predictions into consideration, but only implementing the current time slot (in this case the first hour during a 24-h window) control decision. To reach an implementable control decision for the next hour, optimization over a new 24-h window will be performed based on new forecasts. This approach requires a large amount of future information predictions, more than what are needed in other cooling strategies examined in this paper. For example, although the RCPC strategy also performs precooling optimization over a look-ahead time window, e.g., a day, in each time slot based on various predictions, the resulting optimal cooling schedule will be implemented for the entire day. Thus, comparing these models would not be fair. Second, given constantly updated predictions of future information, most of the above-mentioned cooling strategies (including RCPC, DL control, etc.) can also be embedded into each time slot of the MPC framework to yield an MPC scheme. Therefore, it suffices to compare these strategies directly. Note that since some of the above-mentioned strategies also integrate other strategies (e.g., NS), for the purpose of clarification, Table 3 displays what control components are included in each control strategy. In all cases, the index Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) was kept between −0.5 and +0.5 during the occupied time to maintain indoor thermal comfort. This study adopted the web-based CBE Thermal Comfort Tool [35] through which the PMV value can be automatically calculated based on six pre-defined variables with values set by the user. After estimating and assigning values to five variables including mean radiant temperature, air speed, relative humidity, metabolic rate, and clothing level, researchers adjusted the value of the 6th variable\u2014air temperature\u2014to let the calculated PMV be equal to (or as close as possible to) -0.5 and +0.5. In this way, this study identified 21.8 °C and 24.5 °C to be the lower and upper bounds of setpoint temperature during the occupied time, corresponding to PMV = -0.5 and PMV = +0.5, respectively. Below, the implementation of the examined HVAC control strategies and corresponding control parameter values are presented. 3.1.1 Night setup (NS) and ON/OFF control Both the NS and ON/OFF control strategies attempt to reduce the total cooling energy consumption. The former increases the setpoint temperature during unoccupied hours while the latter shuts off the HVAC system during these hours. This simulation study tested various setup temperatures for the NS strategy and found that the setup temperature setpoint of 24.5 °C led to the lowest cooling energy consumption during the simulation month (i.e., July). As shown in Fig. 3 a, the cooling energy decreases first when the setup temperature is raised. However, after passing the setpoint of 24.5 °C, the cooling energy use rises slowly. The increased amount is likely used to compensate for the extra heat gain by building thermal mass during the NS period. Also, when the stored heat is released back into the indoor space during the daytime, the HVAC system needs more energy to cool the building down when facing higher outside temperatures and solar radiation. Hence, the setup temperature of 24.5 °C was implemented in all control strategies where NS is a component. Figs. 3b and 3c display the daily room setpoint temperature trajectories implemented in the model for the NS and the ON/OFF strategies, respectively. 3.1.2 Demand limiting (DL) control The DL control strategy manipulates the setpoint temperature of the HVAC system during the peak time to reduce the peak cooling demand. In this paper, a group of six previously proposed DL schemes were tested. They fall into two classes: simple heuristic methods and mathematical optimization techniques. The former includes three HVAC scheduling schemes, i.e., concave-increasing (CI), step-up (SU), and linear-up (LU). During the peak time, the setpoint temperature of the CI strategy was raised based on Eq. (5), shown below, until it reached 24.5 °C at the end of peak time; the SU strategy fixed the setpoint temperature at 24.5 °C during the peak time; and the LU strategy raised the setpoint temperature linearly until it reached 24.5 °C at the end of peak time. The daily room setpoint temperature trajectories of these strategies are displayed in Fig. 4 . (5) T k = α ( 1 − e − ( k − i ) ) + T i , i = 12 , k ∈ Γ , where Γ denotes the set of time in the peak period; i is the starting time of the peak time; T i is the room setpoint temperature at the starting time; k represents any given time during the peak time; T k is the room setpoint temperature at the time of k ; and α is a constant that can be determined by the room setpoint temperatures at the start and ending time of the peak time. The mathematical optimization techniques include the semi-analytical (SA), exponential setpoint equation-based semi-analytical (ESA), and load weighted-average (WA) methods proposed by Lee and Braun [12]. The setpoint temperature trajectories of these methods during the peak time were calculated based on the process described in Ref. [12] and illustrated in Fig. 5 . 3.1.3 Precooling (PC) and extended precooling (EPC) The PC strategy aims to maintain the room temperature at the lower bound of the thermal comfort range (i.e., 21.8 °C) during the morning off-peak time (7 a.m.\u201312 p.m.). This is in order to store extra cooling energy in the building mass, which can be released during the peak time to limit the peak cooling load. Compared with the PC strategy, EPC extends precooling into the unoccupied time where the room setpoint temperature could be set below 21.8 °C, if necessary. As the simulation results from this study did not show extra energy savings when using a lower setpoint, 21.8 °C was also used as precooling temperature for EPC. This study examined the DL control methods prior to the PC and EPC strategies. In this way, the DL method that had resulted in the lowest peak load as proved by the simulation results could be incorporated into PC and EPC for peak-period HVAC control. To determine the optimal extended precooling time, this study simulated and compared the cooling energy consumption, the peak cooling load, and the electricity cost for cooling with different precooling start times. As shown in Fig. 6 , with earlier precooling start times, the cooling energy consumption increases while the peak cooling load decreases. The ideal precooling start time associated with the least electricity cost was found to be 10 p.m. during the simulation period. The daily room setpoint temperature trajectories of PC and EPC are illustrated in Fig. 7 . 3.1.4 RC network-based precooling optimization (RCPC) The resistive-capacitive (RC) thermal model is a simplified approach adopted by researchers to simulate the heat transfer in a building. A building with a multi-zone HVAC system can be modeled as an RC network. The RCPC strategy proposed by Shi et al. [15] aimed to jointly minimize the total cooling energy cost and the peak demand via an RC network-based analytical model for multi-zone HVAC precooling. In particular, optimal cooling schedules (i.e., daily room setpoint temperature trajectories) covering both peak and non-peak periods were generated through multi-objective mathematical optimization subject to the indoor temperature evolution dynamics (captured in the RC network-based thermal model), the initial building condition, and the human comfort zone constraints. By following the process described in Ref. [15], this study created an accurate and tractable mathematical framework based on the 4th floor of the NDL building (representing a multi-zone case). Based on this mathematical model and the electricity rate schedule, the daily setpoint temperature trajectories during the simulation period were optimized. This study examined two commonly used rate schedules. The adopted time-of-day (TOD) schedule is applied in the power rate zone of AEP [36]. This schedule includes the energy charge and demand charge. The energy charge is 2.27 cents/kWh from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. local time for all weekdays, and 0.04 cents/kWh from 9 p.m. to 7 a.m. for all weekdays and all hours on weekends. The demand charge is calculated by multiplying $4.16/kW by the highest peak load during the peak time in a monthly billing period. The examined hourly day-ahead energy market locational marginal pricing (LMP) schedule (shown in Fig. 8 ) was retrieved from the PJM website based on the prediction for July 15, 2017 [37]. Fig. 9 displays two examples of the optimized daily room setpoint temperature trajectory of the RCPC strategy. To simplify the modeling process, this study implemented the setpoint temperature trajectory of the 4th floor to the whole building. 3.2 Energy performance objectives Most of the above-presented HVAC scheduling techniques were originally designed to meet specific energy performance goals. Their effects on other energy performance metrics are often not thoroughly evaluated. As a result, the potential trade-offs or additional benefits associated with these techniques could not be fully considered when identifying the best strategy for building operations. Based on whole-building energy simulation, this study holistically evaluated and compared the performance of the tested HVAC scheduling techniques side-by-side. The evaluation was based on three main metrics: the total cooling energy use, the peak cooling load, and the electricity cost for cooling. Specifically, these strategies\u2019 energy use and peak load reduction effects were measured using the reduction ratios defined in Eqs. (6) and (7) below: (6) E n e r g y R e d u c t i o n R a t i o = E n e r g y b a s e l i n e − E n e r g y d e s i g n E n e r g y b a s e l i n e × 100 % , where E n e r g y b a s e l i n e denotes the total cooling energy consumption of the baseline, and E n e r g y d e s i g n denotes the energy used by each of the tested HVAC control strategies. (7) P e a k L o a d R e d u c t i o n R a t i o = max k b ∈ Γ Q ˙ b a s e l i n e [ k b ] − max k d ∈ Γ Q ˙ d e s i g n [ k d ] max k b ∈ Γ Q ˙ b a s e l i n e [ k b ] × 100 % where Q ˙ b a s e l i n e [ k b ] and Q ˙ d e s i g n [ k d ] denote the cooling loads of the baseline and the other HVAC control strategies at the time k b and time k d during the peak time, respectively. For all the tested strategies, their electricity costs of cooling in the simulation month were computed based on both the TOD and LMP schedules adopted in this study. Particularly, the electricity costs associated with the TOD schedule were calculated based on Eq. (8): (8) C o s t T O D = ∑ t ∈ A l l t i m e s p [ t ] u [ t ] + P p e a k max k ∈ Γ Q ˙ [ k ] , where p [ t ] and u [ t ] represent, respectively, the energy charge and the energy input of the HVAC system at the time t ; P p e a k is the demand charge; and Q ˙ [ k ] denotes the cooling load of a control strategy at the time k during the peak time Γ. The electricity cost saving performance of the tested HVAC control strategies was measured by the cost reduction ratio defined in Eq. (9): (9) C o s t R e d u c t i o n R a t i o = C o s t b a s e l i n e − C o s t d e s i g n C o s t b a s e l i n e × 100 % where C o s t b a s e l i n e denotes the electricity cost of the baseline and C o s t d e s i g n denotes the electricity cost of each tested HVAC control strategy. 4 Results and discussion 4.1 Total energy consumption comparison Fig. 10 illustrates the comparison results of cooling energy consumption. Compared with the baseline with the total cooling energy use at 2.01 × 105 kWh for the simulation month, the NS and ON/OFF strategies achieved 5.2% and 5.8% reduction, respectively, due to the reduced or eliminated cooling load during the unoccupied time. The six DL strategies performed similarly by obtaining the highest energy reduction ratios ranging from 9.8% to 10.5%, of which ESA outperformed the others. The PC strategy had a slightly lower reduction ratio (i.e., 8.6%) than the DL strategies due to the increased cooling energy consumption during the morning off-peak time. By extending precooling hours, EPC further increased the cooling energy use, resulting in the lowest reduction ratio of 2.0%. The energy reduction ratios of RCPC based on either TOD or LMP varied widely, i.e., 3.8% (being the second lowest) versus 9.7% (among the highest). 4.2 Peak load comparison Fig. 11 displays plots of the hourly cooling load range for each given time of day during the whole simulation month and how the loads were shifted when different HVAC scheduling strategies were implemented. While the baseline, NS, and ON/OFF controls all experienced peak demands at around 4 p.m., all other strategies were able to successfully shift the building's peak demands to morning hours or noon. Fig. 12 compares the peak cooling loads of the tested HVAC scheduling techniques against the baseline peak load at 596.57 kW during the simulation month. The NS and ON/OFF strategies were found to result in higher peak loads, leading to negative reduction ratios (i.e., -3.2% and -4.9%, respectively). This is because in the baseline the building is conditioned during the unoccupied time and retains some cooling energy in the building mass, which helps shift some peak load during the peak time to unoccupied hours, as evidenced by the higher cooling loads during unoccupied time (see Fig. 11a). The six DL strategies resulted in the peak load reduction ratios ranging from 6.4% (LU) to 13.2% (CI). Compared with plots in Figs. 11a-11c, the peak loads of the DL strategies across Figs. 11d-11i were all reduced. On top of the CI strategy, by precooling the building to the lower temperature (21.8 °C) during the morning off-peak time and the unoccupied time, the PC and EPC strategies achieved significant peak load reduction, i.e., 15.4% and 21.4%, respectively. This can also be observed in Figs. 11j and 11k. However, by extending the precooling time to 10 p.m. of the previous day, the EPC strategy resulted in higher cooling loads and energy use throughout the unoccupied time (Fig. 11k), which helps explain why EPC had the lowest energy reduction ratio in the total energy consumption comparison. RCPC had relatively lower peak reduction ratios at 6.7% for TOD and 2.7% for LMP since its main objective was to minimize cooling energy costs. 4.3 Electricity cost comparison Fig. 13 compares the electricity cooling costs of the 11 HVAC scheduling techniques with the baseline based on the TOD and LMP rate schedules. As the demand charge is a significant part of the TOD schedule and the electricity rate during the unoccupied time is extremely low, strategies achieving lower peak loads would usually result in lower electricity costs. As shown in Fig. 12a, compared to the baseline cost of $5970 for the simulation month, the NS and ON/OFF strategies led to higher electricity costs with -5.3% and -7.2% cost reduction ratios, respectively. In contrast, the DL strategies lowered the electricity costs by 2.6%\u20137.3%. By reducing the peak load more dramatically, EPC achieved one of the highest cost reduction ratios (i.e., 16.3%), only slightly lower than the RCPC strategy, which had a reduction ratio of 16.7%. PC had a cost reduction performance comparable to the DL strategies. Although it had a slightly lower peak load, the savings are offset by the increased electricity consumption during the morning off-peak time, when the electricity rate is relatively high. Fig. 13b compares the LMP-based electricity costs of different strategies. Differing from the TOD rate schedule, LMP has neither the demand charge nor significant differences in electricity rates between the unoccupied time and the peak time. Thus, strategies with lower cooling energy use usually lead to lower electricity costs. Compared to the baseline cost of $5310 for the simulation month, the RCPC optimization strategy obtained the highest cost reduction ratio of 12.9%. This was followed by the DL strategies with reduction ratios ranging from 10.7% to 11.6%. With higher cooling energy consumption than the DL strategies, EPC resulted in a lower reduction ratio of 5.7%. Both the NS and ON/OFF strategies had the lowest cost reduction ratio of 3.1%. The comparison results verified the exceptional performance of RCPC optimization. 4.4 Discussion With an increasing awareness of energy conservation, many building owners (including The Ohio State University) have chosen to adopt the relatively simple thermostat setback/setup control strategy to reduce building energy use and utility cost. However, according to the simulation results, compared to the 24/7 baseline, the NS and ON/OFF strategies could only slightly lower cooling energy use but increased the peak load. Under the TOD rate schedule, the incurred electricity cost would be even higher than the baseline. This finding should be communicated to building owners who are under similar circumstances, so they can consider other HVAC cooling strategies. It is worth noting that this finding would not be applicable to all cases since utility costs for commercial buildings are sensitive to many factors including building physical characteristics, occupancy schedule, climate conditions, utility rate structures, etc. [27]. However, its occurrence becomes a strong possibility when building owners face a high price for peak time electricity use or demand charges that make up a significant portion of their monthly electric bills. This study shows that a good alternative would be the six DL strategies (including both simple heuristic and mathematical optimization techniques) with NS control incorporated. In general, these strategies\u2019 performance levels are quite close. Although they are mainly designed to reduce peak load, they can also cut down cooling energy use and perform better than the NS and ON/OFF methods. The simulation results show that the DL strategies can result in lower electricity costs based on both TOD and LMP rate schedules. In particular, the SU heuristic method can perform very well and is also simpler to implement. Compared to the DL control, the PC and EPC strategies further reduced the peak cooling loads by precooling the building during the morning off-peak time and the unoccupied time, respectively, but increased cooling energy use to some degree. This study showed that the determination of optimal precooling temperature and time is important for achieving the best performance of these strategies. Also, while PC's cost reduction performance is comparable to the DL control, EPC can obtain a much higher reduction ratio based on the TOD schedule, but incur a lower reduction ratio based on LMP. Thus, owners need to make smart decisions based on their rate schedules. In contrast, besides its ability to lower the peak cooling load, the RCPC strategy minimizes the cooling energy cost based on any given electricity rate scheme, which simplifies owners' decision-making process for building operations. Specifically, the RC network-based model can capture the influence from building parameters, local weather conditions, operating schedules, occupancy, and plug load levels. This leads to more accurate, building-specific HVAC control solutions. In general, these examined HVAC scheduling techniques have their own characteristics. The NS and ON/OFF strategies can be easily implemented by building operators, but have limited energy saving potential, lead to higher peak loads, and incur higher energy cost under certain circumstances. The other techniques have better performance potential. However, implementing them requires more advanced HVAC control systems or high-skill building operators due to the complexity of dynamic control. Such requirements need to be included in the design and construction documents of building projects and building operation/energy management contracts. In this simulation study, all the tested HVAC cooling strategies were implemented with setpoint temperatures that can ensure indoor thermal conditions falling within the comfort zone of ASHRAE Standard 55, which meets buildings\u2019 thermal performance goals. As reported by Xu et al. [38], in a field study where the PC and EPC strategies were applied to a moderate-weight commercial building with setpoint temperatures during the occupied period set at 21.1 °C (from 5 a.m. to 2 p.m.) and 25.6 °C (from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m.), the building operator did not receive any occupant complaints throughout the entire testing period. Conversations with the building occupants also revealed that they barely noticed the changes in building operations. 5 Conclusion This paper compared 11 selected HVAC cooling strategies against the 24/7 operation baseline in: 1) total cooling energy use, 2) peak demand, and 3) cooling energy cost. Via a well-validated simulation model that predicts both energy use and thermal behavior of a real-world building, accurate comparisons were made side-by-side. This study ran additional simulations to determine the ideal night setup temperature, precooling temperature, and precooling starting time for the examined HVAC strategies to achieve their full capabilities, which would further drive down the energy cost. The research findings show that although the NS and ON/OFF strategies can slightly reduce the total cooling energy use when compared to the baseline, the elevated peak demand could incur even higher electricity cost under the TOD rate schedule. Overall, the DL control strategies perform well across all three energy performance metrics and lead to the lowest cooling energy use. In reducing the peak cooling load, the PC and EPC strategies outperform all other techniques. Their cost reduction performance varies based on the rate schedules and is largely impacted by the demand charge. Finally, the RCPC optimization strategy can achieve the largest cost savings based on both TOD and LMP pricing schemes. The comparison results are reliable, insightful, and straightforward, and can be easily understood by building owners when making operation decisions to meet their energy management goals.

        "dc:description": "In recent years, various heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) control strategies have been proposed to reduce buildings\u2019 energy consumption and environmental impacts. Due to different research designs, it is impossible to directly compare the reported performance of these strategies and determine the best approach for operating real-world buildings. To fill this gap, this research uses a well-validated building simulation model to holistically evaluate the performance of 12 existing HVAC cooling strategies in reducing the total cooling energy use, peak demand, and cooling energy cost. The findings include: i) The ON/OFF and night setup control strategies could lead to even higher energy cost than the 24/7 operation baseline; ii) demand-limiting control methods performed well across the three energy performance metrics and achieved the highest energy reduction ratios ranging from 9.8% to 10.5%; iii) precooling and extended precooling reduced the peak load most significantly by 15.4% and 21.4%, respectively; and iv) the resistive-capacitive (RC) network-based precooling optimization resulted in the highest electricity cost savings with reduction ratios of 16.6% and 12.9%, based on the two common price schedules. Besides providing valuable insights to the research community, this study offers a practical method to help building operators analyze and select the best HVAC control strategies for their energy management goals.",
