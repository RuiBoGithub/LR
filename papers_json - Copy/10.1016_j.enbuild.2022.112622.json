An experimental study on round-trip efficiency of a preheating control with a medium office building Sen Huang 1 Srinivas Katipamula \u204e Robert Lutes Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, WA 99352, USA Pacific Northwest National Laboratory Richland WA 99352 USA Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, WA 99352, USA \u204e Corresponding author. 1 Present Affiliation: Oak Ridge National Laboratory, 5200, 1 Bethel Valley Rd, Oak Ridge, TN 37830 U.S. The interactions between building energy efficiency and demand response (DR) with buildings may complicate their impacts on the electricity grid and buildings, yet those interactions are not well understood. This work fills this gap by presenting an experimental study that quantifies the effects of DR on building energy efficiency. Unlike existing studies, this work 1) investigates the uncertainty levels when assessing the effects of DR; 2) studies the impact of rooftop heat pumps with direct expansion refrigerant-to-air coils on the round-trip efficiency. Specifically, we considered a medium office building (∼1860 m2), which is served by rooftop units, located in eastern Washington State. We performed preheating control tests during typical heating days in the year 2022 and compared the building\u2019s energy consumption during the testing days to that during normal operation days under similar weather conditions. To understand how well those normal operation days represent the baseline for the assessment, the relationship between the energy performance of this building and weather conditions was also studied. Experimental results reveal that the round-trip efficiency (i.e., the ratio of discharging energy output from the building to charging energy input into the building) was between 0.16 and 0.92. The results show that significant energy loss may occur during the preheating process. It also suggests a significant correlation between the energy efficiency of the studied building under the preheating control and the outdoor temperature; and a highly nonlinear relationship between the zone temperature changing rate and the weather condition.

However, the high penetration of renewable energy poses stability challenges to the power grid operation [2]. It is well recognized that utilizing power flexibility on the demand side, especially from buildings, to provide demand response (DR) for balancing the power grid is a financially viable option [3]. Quality of service (QoS) must be maintained when utilizing the power flexibility from buildings to provide DR [4]. One commonly discussed QoS measure is the indoor thermal comfort [5], because a significant portion of the power flexibility from buildings is associated with the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems [6]. As a result, substantial research has been devoted to understanding the relationship between power flexibility and indoor thermal comfort [7]. For example, Alimohammadisagvand [8] studied the influences of DR actions on the thermal comfort of residential houses with simulations. Specifically, they pointed out that the acceptable indoor temperature setpoint depends on building operation conditions, characterizing by occupants\u2019 behavior (e.g., metabolic equivalent of task, clothing levels) and types of building systems. Therefore, it is possible to relax the temperature setpoint, e.g., increasing the cooling setpoint to provide DR while not sacrificing thermal comfort. Aghniaey, et al. [9] conducted a study on a university campus to investigate occupants' thermal sensation, acceptability, and preferences corresponding to an increased cooling temperature setpoint. They found a potential for at least temporarily increasing the cooling temperature setpoint (at least 2 °C) across this campus without impairing occupant thermal comfort. Building energy efficiency is another important QoS measure that does not receive similar attention in the literature. As DR is primarily designed to serve the power grid, there is no guarantee that building energy efficiency is not affected [10]. Without considering the interactive effects between building energy efficiency and the DR may decrease the performance of DR and increase the building energy consumption [11]. When designing and deploying DR, considering the impact of the DR on building energy efficiency may bring benefits. It helps to bring cost efficiencies and a more rational allocation of resources for power grids and buildings. Buildings with higher energy efficiency should be prioritized when dispatching DR resources to further improve the overall energy efficiency of the power grid. For example, Alimohammadisagvand, et al. [12] assessed the performance of a DR control with two different buildings: a massive passive building and a lightweight passive building. They found that the cost saving for the former is slightly higher than that of the latter. Understanding the impact of the DR on building energy efficiency can also increase the willingness of building operators to participate in the DR by capturing energy savings and building bill-reduction opportunities that might otherwise be lost. For example, by considering energy efficiency, we could mitigate the rebound effect, i.e., an increase in the building energy consumption after the DR event. For example, Motegi, et al. [13] demonstrated how to avoid the rebound effect by eliminating the sudden recovery of HVAC operations. More precisely, they did so by slowly restoring the curtailed control setpoints and extending the DR durations. Note that building energy efficiency has been implicitly considered in some DR control methods. Model-based DR methods such as model predictive control [14] essentially consider the building energy efficiency with building energy models. For example, Oldewurtel, et al. [15] demonstrated significant energy savings potential for MPC with a large-scale simulation study where different cases varying in the building type, HVAC system, and weather conditions were considered. However, the potential interactive effects between the DR and energy efficiency are not well considered in the DR practice in general. This is partly because the relationship between DR and energy efficiency is not well understood. Some researchers [16] studied the energy efficiency of variable-air-volume (VAV) systems [17,18,19,20] when providing grid service with simulations or experiments. Despite providing remarkable insights, those studies either need additional work to verify their accuracy or only provide purely qualitative results. Because of the knowledge gaps, building energy efficiency is seldom considered when designing and deploying DR with buildings in practice. This paper presents an experimental study of the effects of DR on building energy efficiency. This study considered an occupied, medium office building (∼1860 m2) located in eastern Washington State. This building is served by 11 rooftop heat pumps with direct expansion (DX) refrigerant-to-air coils. A preheating control in this building was deployed which increases the thermostat heating setpoints several hours before the scheduled occupied period. We performed a test of this preheating control during the 2022 heating season. The impacts of the preheating control on the building\u2019s energy efficiency were assessed by comparing the building\u2019s energy consumption during the testing days to that during normal operation days under similar weather conditions. To understand how well those normal operation days represent the baseline for the assessment, we studied the relationship between the energy performance of this building and the weather conditions. This study contributes to the literature from two aspects: \u2022 It presents a field test of the effects of DR on building energy efficiency. Compared to existing work, this test has two unique features: 1) rooftop heat pumps with DX coils, which are commonly used to serve small and medium commercial buildings, are studied; and 2) uncertainty levels are included in the estimated assessment results\u2014both of which have never been studied before, to our best knowledge. \u2022 It provides insights for incorporating energy efficiency into DR programs which help researchers identify future research directions of the DR with buildings and provide policymakers with references for enhancing incentive programs. The results also support the effort to coordinate energy efficiency and DR programs to maximize values to both the power grid and buildings. The work reported in this paper is different from previously reported work in the following aspects: 1) it investigates the uncertainty levels when assessing the effects of DR, 2) it studies the impact of round-trip efficiency on the rooftop heat pumps with direct expansion refrigerant-to-air coils. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 briefly describes the relevant work on studying building energy efficiency under DR. Section 3 introduces the building studied in this work and the preheating control strategy. Section 4 details the test of the preheating control, as well as the analysis of the building energy performance results. Finally, Section 5 provides conclusions and directions for future work. 2 Literature review As mentioned in the previous section, existing studies of building energy efficiency under DR focused on the VAV systems because these systems are commonly used HVAC systems in large commercial buildings. Those studies can be divided into two groups: experimental and simulation. 2.1 Experimental studies Some researchers studied building energy efficiency with real building experiments. Beil, et al. [16] performed DR experiments on a ∼30,000 m2 office building. In their experiments, all the cooling setpoints in the building were decreased/increased to increase/decrease the fans\u2019 power demand in the VAV systems during a 15-min period. This was done to track a square wave power reference signal designed to be energy neutral, as illustrated in Fig. 1 . After that, the cooling setpoints are changed to their default values to allow the building to regain normal operation for 90 mins. The round-trip efficiency (RTE) of the supply fans was calculated using: (1) η = E o u t E i n where E o u t and E i n are the fan energy consumption below the baseline and the fan energy consumption above the baseline, over the two hours. Based on the experiments, the authors concluded that the RTE of the studied building is around 0.46\u2014much lower than that of electric batteries. Vrettos, et al. [17] deployed frequency regulation on a test facility (floor area: ∼120 m2) consisting of two identical zones served by two dedicated VAV systems. In their experiment, Vrettos, et al. used one VAV system for frequency regulation while the other one operated normally. By comparing the total energy consumption of the two VAV systems, Vrettos, et al. concluded that the building energy efficiency increases by 8.6 % when providing frequency regulation. Keskar, et al. [21] repeated the experiments in [16] on three large commercial buildings (total floor area: 33,000 m2) to generate significant responses from each test building. They increased the duration of the DR operation to 30 min. In addition, they considered the power demand of both fans and chillers, which are the major power-consuming components in VAV systems. When evaluating the test result, Keskar, et al. proposed a new metric, called additional energy consumption (AEC), which is calculated by: (2) A E C = E i n - E o u t They believed A E C is more robust since it does not have the \u201cdivide by small numbers\u201d issue; however, it is also difficult to compare A E C across buildings. The conclusions that Keskar, et al. made are very similar to that of [16]. Note that the results of the above experimental works are highly impacted by the accuracy of estimating the baseline power. Beil, et al. and Keskar, et al. estimated the baseline by performing linear interpolation on data over short time windows just before and after the DR event. Although simple, this method may introduce significant errors as it unrealistically assumes no change to the operating conditions, such as weather and occupants\u2019 behaviors, during the two-hour testing period. Beil, et al. attempted to quantify the uncertainty in the baseline estimation by using the same method to predict the power demand of the supply fans during normal operation days and then compared the predictions to measured power demand for those days. Based on the comparison, Beil, et al. concluded that the prediction error is on the order of ∼10 %. However, it is not clear whether the prediction error is impacted by the operating conditions. Therefore, the assessment results on the normal operation days may not apply to the testing days. The results of Vrettos, et al. are based on the assumption that the two VAV systems are identical in terms of operating conditions and system characteristics. However, this assumption may not be valid all the time. For example, the solar heat gains of the VAV systems\u2019 zones may be different, as they have different orientations. Therefore, additional work is needed to verify the accuracy of the results from those experimental works. 2.2 Simulation studies Some researchers studied building energy performances under DR with building energy models. Lin, et al. [19] repeated the experiments in [16] with EnergyPlus [22], a building energy model, to explain why more energy is consumed during the DR event. They varied the fan power consumption and computed the difference between the baseline and actual energy consumption to determine the building efficiency under a DR event. They also explored the impact of building parameters, control design, and baseline model accuracy on building efficiency. Based on the simulation results, Lin, et al. drew the following conclusions: 1) building efficiency under DR is affected by the average indoor temperature, DR control sequence, and how aggressive the DR event is; and 2) baseline estimation errors have an outsized effect on the efficiency calculations. Raman, et al. [20] conducted a detailed analysis of the RTE of a VAV system based on a simplified physics-based model of building thermal and power dynamics. With this model, Raman, et al. repeatedly increased and decreased the power of the studied VAV system and monitored the change in the zone temperature. Based on the simulation results, the RTE was close to 1 under multiple DR events. When the number of DR events is small, the RTE can be larger or smaller than one depending on the period of the reference DR event, the RTE ranges from 0.7 to 1.3 in their case study. The results from those simulation-based studies may be interpreted qualitatively, not quantitatively, because the simulation models used in those studies tend to be oversimplified. For example, in [19], outdoor air temperature and internal heat gains are assumed to be constant. Although those assumptions are necessary for performing a more rigorous investigation, they limit the extent to which the results from those studies can be applied to real practices. The experimental studies can provide quantitative results for understanding the relationship between building energy efficiency and DR with more realistic operation conditions. However, the experimental studies suffer from uncertainties in the estimation of the baseline power. 3 Test building and preheating control In this section, we first introduce the test building, and the rooftop heat pumps that serve it. After that, we will elaborate on the preheating control strategy that was implemented in the test building. 3.1 Test building This study considers a 1,858 m2 building built in 1981, with office and storage areas. This building is divided into 11 thermal zones, with each zone served by a rooftop heat pump. As shown in Fig. 2 , the rooftop heat pump consists of five major components: a condenser, a compressor, a fan, a DX coil, and an electric heater. The condenser enables heat exchange between outdoor air and the refrigerant while the compressor increases the pressure of the refrigerant to facilitate the heat exchange in the condenser. The supply fan circulates the air between the heat pump and the thermal zone. The DX coil is used to cool/heat the outdoor/return air mixture (i.e., mixed air). The electric heater heats the mixed air when the DX coil cannot meet the heating load. The compressor and the heater are the major power-consuming components. The compressor and the heater are controlled based on the temperature in the thermal zone. As shown in Fig. 3 , the on\u2013off status of the two components is determined based on a state machine that maintains the zone temperature, T , within a range between T h s - Δ T and T c s + Δ T ( T c s : cooling setpoint, T h s : heating setpoint, Δ T : dead band). Note that the heater is turned ON only if the compressor is already operating. The thermal zone may contain multiple rooms. Although it is common to use a single temperature measured at the thermostat location to control the heat pump, each room in the test building has a temperature sensor. In this case, the zone temperature is the mean value of the temperatures in all rooms. With this state machine, one can indirectly adjust the on\u2013off status of the compressor and the heater by adjusting T h s and T c s . Due to the discrete nature of the control sequence for the rooftop heat pump, its response to the changes of T h s and T c s is rapid and different from the VAV system. The constant speed supply fan operates continuously during the occupied period (6 a.m. to 6p.m.). 3.2 Preheating control The test building is an occupied office building, and it is difficult to vary the building power in a square wave fashion, as it requires decreasing the heating setpoint and thus may decrease the thermal comfort level. Instead, a preheating control was considered in this experimental study. Preheating is a commonly used price-based DR control strategy for building systems [23]. The general idea for preheating control is to shift energy consumption to periods with low electricity prices, resulting in electricity cost reductions. Fig. 4 illustrates how we implemented the preheating control strategy. The heating setpoint was increased at 3:00 a.m. with a step increment of 1.11 °C. The step increase is triggered when the zone temperature equals the heating setpoint until the preheating period ends at 6:00 a.m. or the heating setpoint reaches the upper bound (i.e., normal setpoint value + 4 °C). The heating setpoint is gradually increased to avoid triggering the heater to operate. This heater is expected to only operate during extreme weather conditions and can significantly increase the power demand of the studied building. When the difference between the zone temperature and zone temperature setpoint is less than 1.2 °C, the electric heat will not be triggered. The cooling setpoint was also increased with the heating setpoint to keep the difference between the cooling and the heating setpoint constant and to prevent the rooftop heat pumps from going into cooling mode. It is worth mentioning that the trajectories of the heating setpoint for those thermal zones may be different from each other under this preheating control. By preheating this building, electricity is converted into heating energy which is stored in the thermal mass. The building is effectively \u201ccharged as a virtual battery. When releasing the preheating control, the stored electricity is discharged from this virtual battery. 4 Real building test In this section, we describe the test procedure, in terms of the implementation of the preheating control, estimating the baseline power, and calculating the energy efficiency metric. After that, we present the results and provide insights into the implications. 4.1 Test procedure As illustrated in Fig. 5 , the test procedure consists of three major steps: preheating control implementation, baseline power estimation, and energy efficiency calculation. The preheating control implementation is to implement the preheating control and set up the test; the baseline power estimation is to define the baseline and quantify the uncertainty from estimating the baseline power demand; the energy efficiency calculation is to develop the metric for quantifying the building energy efficiency. In what follows, details of each step are presented. 4.1.1 Preheating control implementation We implemented the preheating control by leveraging an existing testing infrastructure built on top of Eclipse VOLTTRONTM [24]. More precisely, the preheating control sequence was implemented using VOLTTRONTM to overwrite the control points and record the measurements from the building management system. More details about this testing infrastructure can be found in [25]. Note that this testing infrastructure allows for executing the test of the preheating control in a fully automatic manner. The preheating control tests were conducted from Jan. 26 to Feb. 9, as shown in Fig. 6 . During this period, the outdoor temperature varied from −5 °C to 17 °C and there was up to 16 °C diurnal temperature variation. The outdoor temperature varied between −5 °C and 5 °C early in the morning during this period, providing a good weather condition for testing the preheating control. Note that weekends are excluded from the testing since DR events are not commonly deployed during weekends. In addition, Feb. 4 was excluded from the analysis because of missing data. 4.1.2 Baseline power estimation Estimation of baseline power is essential to assessing building energy efficiency. A baseline power represents the \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d energy performance of the studied building. If the building power is larger than the baseline power, this building is considered to be \u201ccharging\u201d, i.e., using more power than it needs. In the opposite case, this building is considered to be \u201cdischarging\u201d, i.e., using less power than it needs. In this test, the baseline power is defined as the estimated power demand of the studied building if it was controlled by the default control sequence (see Section 3.1) during the test day when the preheating control was enforced. We estimate the baseline power based on historic data that was sampled during normal days in 2022 (January to March) and thus shares similar patterns of internal heat gains with the testing data. During those normal days, this building was controlled by the default control sequence. Specifically, \u2022 we identify the key factors that determine the building power under the default control sequence based on the correlations between those facts and the building power \u2022 we select the normal days during which the key factors are closer to those during the test days and use the power demand of those normal days to approximate the baseline power. When identifying those key factors, we considered typical factors of commercial building power usage, including the internal activity level and the weather condition. Since the internal activity level is not measured, our primary focus was the correlation between the weather condition, represented by the outdoor temperature, and the power demand of the studied building. Specifically, we compared the power demand for those normal days with similar trajectories of outdoor temperature. As shown in Fig. 7 , Day 1 and Day 2 are examples of normal days with similar trajectories of the outdoor temperature. We can see that, although the one-minute power demand for those two days is not identical, it is close. A similar pattern can be also observed when comparing the power for Day 3 and Day 4, which also have similar trajectories of the outdoor temperature. On the contrary, the energy consumption for normal days with significantly different outdoor temperature trajectories deviate from each other, as illustrated in Fig. 8 . Based on those comparisons, we identify the weather condition as the key factor in determining the energy consumption in the test building under the default control sequence. Note that the short-term power demand of this building still is quite different even with similar outdoor temperatures. This is due to the discrete control for the rooftop heat pumps, and it does not affect the analysis of the long-term energy performance. We then select the normal days during which outdoor temperature trajectories are closer to those during the test days, named baseline days. We quantify the closeness of outdoor temperature trajectories with the average difference in outdoor temperature, calculated by (3) Δ T o , i , j = ∑ t = 1 N | T o , i t - T o , j t | N where T o , i t and T o , j t are the outdoor temperature at time t of normal day i and normal day j , respectively. N is the number of time steps in a day. In the test, Δ T o , i , j of each testing day and its corresponding baseline day is set to be no higher than 2.5 °C. As the true values of the baseline power are unknown, we quantified the accuracy of the baseline power estimation indirectly by comparing the energy consumption of two normal days whose outdoor temperature trajectories are similar. If the differences between the energy consumption of those two normal days are smaller, we believe the prediction accuracy is good. We calculated the difference in the energy consumption for the two normal days by: (4) ε i , j t = | E i t - E j t | max ( E i t , E j t ) where E i t and E j t are the energy consumption of the studied building at time t of normal day i and normal day j , respectively. The relative errors for 43 pairs of normal days ( Δ T o , i , j of each pair is less than 2.5 °C) were calculated to investigate the distribution of the relative errors. As shown in Fig. 9 , the median values of the relative errors are less than 0.1. When the hour index increases from 0 to 12, the relative errors reduce. This indicates | E i t - E j t | may not change much by the increase of the hour index. When the hour index is larger than 12, the relative errors seem to be less sensitive to the change in the hour index. Because the power consumption during the occupied period is higher than that during the unoccupied period, the median value of the inaccuracy for the baseline power estimation is close to 0.05 after 6 a.m. In summary, we found: \u2022 A significant correlation between the outdoor temperature and the power demand of the studied building under the default control. Therefore, we can use the power measurement from a normal day with a similar outdoor temperature trajectory to approximate the baseline power for a testing day. \u2022 We indirectly assessed the accuracy of the baseline power estimation by comparing the energy consumption of two normal days whose outdoor temperature trajectories are similar. The median value of the relative errors when estimating the baseline power is less than 0.05 for the studied normal days. 4.1.3 Energy efficiency calculation In this study, like the previous study [16], we also quantify the building energy efficiency with RTE, calculated by (5) η = ∑ t = t 2 t 3 ( P b t - P p t ) ∑ t = t 1 t 2 ( P p t - P b t ) where P p t and P b t are the power demand of the studied building at time t of a test day and its corresponding baseline day, respectively. t 1 and t 2 are the starting time and the ending time of the preheating period. In this study, t 1 and t 2 are 3 a.m. and 6 a.m., respectively. t 3 is the time when the building is back to normal operation and is calculated as: (6) t 3 = m a x ( t c 1 , ⋯ , t c 11 ) where t c i is the first time when the zone temperature of thermal zone i is lower than its heating setpoint since t 2 . The \u201cdischarging\u201d rate of each thermal zone is quantified using the zone temperature changing rate, δ i , calculated by (7) δ i = T i t 2 - T i t c 1 t c 1 - t 2 where T i t is the zone temperature of the thermal zone i at time t . A higher value for δ i indicates lower thermal inertia, resulting in a lower potential for providing grid services. Note that the definition of RTE in equation (5) differs from that in equation (1). The former defines the ability of buildings to \u201cstore\u201d electricity for future usage, while the latter characterizes the energy loss by buildings when following a power reference signal designed to be energy neutral. Those two definitions of RTE are useful for different DR programs. For instance, the definition of RTE in equation (5) can be used to assess the performance of a load-shifting control [26] while RTE equation (1) is useful when assessing a frequency regulation control [27]. 4.2 Results and analysis As the RTE is highly associated with the thermal characterization of the studied building, we first study zone temperature changing rates during the discharging period, as shown in Table 1 . The zone temperature changing rates vary from 0.01°C/min to 0.09°C/min. In other words, it takes around 10 min to 100 min for the zone temperature to drop by 1 °C. In addition, the zone temperature changing rates are not proportional to the floor area of the thermal zones. For example, the floor area of the thermal zone served by HP11 is only half of that of the thermal zone served by HP1. However, the zone temperature changing rate for HP11 is mostly larger than HP1. We also observed that the zone temperature changing rates are not always inversely proportional to the outdoor temperature. Some HPs, such as HP3 and HP9, have higher values when the outdoor temperature is lower. However, some HPs, such as HP8, have higher values when the outdoor temperature is higher. In other words, the relationship between the zone temperature changing rate and the weather condition tends to be highly nonlinear. Based on the trajectories of zone temperatures during the discharging period, we identified t 3 and calculated the length of the discharging period, as shown in Table 2 . The length of the discharging period varies from about two to four hours, meaning the discharge rate of the studied building can be smaller or larger than the charge rate. Like the zone temperature changing rates, the discharging period is not inversely proportional to the outdoor temperature. After identifying the length of the discharging period, the energy performance of the studied building was compared to the power demand of the testing day to the baseline power, as shown in Fig. 10 . During the period from 3:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m., the power demand for the test day is generally higher than that for the baseline day. Immediately after 6:00 a.m., when the preheating control is released, the power demand for the test day drops and becomes lower than that for the baseline day. The power demand for the test day begins to increase at around 7:30 a.m. and becomes close to that for the baseline day at around 8:30 a.m. The RTE for the test days is calculated based on the power demand data, as shown in Fig. 11 . The RTE changes significantly among different test days and varies from 0.16 to 0.92\u2014meaning that up to 84 % of electricity could be lost during the preheating process. In addition, there is a tendency for the RTE to be higher when the outdoor temperature is lower, which shows that it is more energy-efficient to operate the preheating control during cold days. One possible explanation is that with a lower outdoor temperature, the extent to which the zone temperature can be increased is lower and thereby reducing the heat loss to the ambient environment. 5 Conclusions This paper presents an experimental study of the effects of DR on building energy efficiency. The study was conducted in an occupied, medium-sized office building served by rooftop heat pumps. Based on the experiment results, we draw the following conclusions: 1) Significant energy loss may occur during the preheating process. The RTE of the studied building can be as low as 0.16. In other words, up to 84 % of electricity is lost when performing preheating control in the studied building. 2) The results suggest a significant correlation between the energy efficiency of the studied building under the preheating control and the outdoor temperature. The RTE is increased from 0.16 to 0.92 when the outdoor temperature decreases from 4.5 °C to −2.6 °C. 3) The zone temperature changing rates of the studied building vary from 0.01°C/min to 0.09°C/min and are not proportional to the floor area of the thermal zones. The relationship between the zone temperature changing rate and the weather condition seems to be highly nonlinear. The results from this study can be used to enhance DR programs and DR controls in various aspects. Just to name a few, the energy loss due to building energy efficiency change is usually not considered when determining the electricity price. One interesting future work is developing price corrections based on the RTE information from this study so that the overall energy efficiency of the power system can be achieved. Alternatively, one can also include the RTE information when developing demand curves for buildings under transactive control [28]. In such a case, the RTE information is explicitly included in the price generation process. In cases where the future price of electricity is known, researchers have used MPC to minimize the cost. However, the implementation of MPC is complex and takes significant effort to deploy. Simplified reduced-order models that leverage the correlation between RTE and outdoor air temperature can be used instead. This approach may not yield the optimal solution but is a lot simpler to implement. On the other hand, the correlation between the RTE and the outdoor temperature can also be used to improve the deployment of the preheating control. For example, one can generate simple algorithms based on the correlation to determine when a preheating control can provide significant grid service without sacrificing too much energy. In addition, the RTE can also be incorporated with other metrics, such as the degradation cost associated with the preheating control, to help building operators identify a better strategy to participate in the DR programs. In such a case, rather than only operation cost, comprehensive consideration of other negative impacts of providing DR can be incorporated into the decision-making process. Because the RTE of a building is not known a priori, a simple preheating/precooling test can be conducted automatically to estimate the RTE of a building. This estimate can be refined over time as more data from DR events is available.

        "dc:description": "The interactions between building energy efficiency and demand response (DR) with buildings may complicate their impacts on the electricity grid and buildings, yet those interactions are not well understood. This work fills this gap by presenting an experimental study that quantifies the effects of DR on building energy efficiency. Unlike existing studies, this work 1) investigates the uncertainty levels when assessing the effects of DR; 2) studies the impact of rooftop heat pumps with direct expansion refrigerant-to-air coils on the round-trip efficiency. Specifically, we considered a medium office building (∼1860 m2), which is served by rooftop units, located in eastern Washington State. We performed preheating control tests during typical heating days in the year 2022 and compared the building\u2019s energy consumption during the testing days to that during normal operation days under similar weather conditions. To understand how well those normal operation days represent the baseline for the assessment, the relationship between the energy performance of this building and weather conditions was also studied. Experimental results reveal that the round-trip efficiency (i.e., the ratio of discharging energy output from the building to charging energy input into the building) was between 0.16 and 0.92. The results show that significant energy loss may occur during the preheating process. It also suggests a significant correlation between the energy efficiency of the studied building under the preheating control and the outdoor temperature; and a highly nonlinear relationship between the zone temperature changing rate and the weather condition.",
