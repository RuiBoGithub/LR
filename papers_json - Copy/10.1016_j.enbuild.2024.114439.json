This shift towards renewable energy generation has prompted extensive research aimed at analyzing renewable energy potential, addressing associated challenges, and formulating relevant policies tailored to specific geographical locations. Owing to this, the study [2] conducts a thorough quantitative analysis using weather-driven modeling to assess changing backup power demands in large-scale renewable energy systems, providing valuable insights for stakeholders and policymakers. From the perspective of renewables, the review article [3] provides a comprehensive overview of solar renewable energy and other energy sources, offering valuable insights into their potential for future energy planning and sustainability efforts. It fails to encompass more in-depth analysis/ potential challenges with the adoption of specific renewable energy technologies. Additionally, there has been considerable interest in exploring various techniques deployed worldwide to incentivize the integration of renewable energy sources into existing energy infrastructure. One significant aspect of this renewable energy transition is the emphasis on demand-side management (DSM) strategies, which play a pivotal role in optimizing energy consumption patterns and leveraging renewable resources for sustainable development. The research article [4] addresses a critical need for demand-side management (DSM) in the resource-rich country − Qatar, offering a tailored framework and survey-based insights to promote sustainable consumption behavior, filling a significant research gap in the Gulf Cooperation Council region. However, the study could benefit from a deeper exploration of specific DSM policies and the potential challenges as well as implications of the policies on economic, social, and environmental aspects. While the study addressed in [5] presents a critical gap in DSM research by proposing a reinforced DSM approach tailored for educational institutions, leveraging solar PV generation and an enhanced optimization algorithm to reduce peak demand, and electricity costs, and improve user comfort, offering valuable insights for sustainable energy management in this sector. DSM techniques, including peak demand reduction and strategic load shaping, are increasingly being adopted across sectors to enhance electricity savings, minimize peak demand, and improve overall energy utilization. These efforts align closely with Sustainable Development Goals, which aim to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all. The paper [6] introduces a modular framework for efficient load scheduling in the context of a smart grid, emphasizing real-time interaction between residents and power companies to optimize electricity cost and demand peaks by the use of fog and cloud computing techniques. Such analysis in real-time is possible with the development of IoT-integrated gadgets/ devices or the introduction of artificial intelligence and distributed computing. The article [7] presents a comprehensive approach to energy management in commercial buildings by integrating IoT-based Smart Compact Energy Meters (SCEMs) and Demand Side Management (DSM), offering real-time monitoring, control, and optimization of energy usage. Such research in [8] concerns the dearth of electrical energy due to increasing demand. Provided IoT-enabled residential buildings as a solution to participate in demand response programs, managed by a wind-driven bacterial foraging algorithm (WBFA), it optimizes energy usage. However, practical challenges related to grid stability, regulatory frameworks, and economic viability are not thoroughly explored. Despite these advancements, achieving carbon neutrality remains a significant global challenge, with only a fraction of countries currently committed to this goal. To address this challenge, there is a growing recognition of the need to integrate renewable energy sources into urban energy systems, given that urban areas are both significant energy consumers and contributors to greenhouse gas emissions. Stand-alone Hybrid Energy Systems (HES), which combine conventional and renewable energy sources, offer a promising solution to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and achieve zero carbon emissions in urban environments [9]. Towards this, the research [10] identifies the challenges of real-time energy optimization due to the unpredictable nature of RES and electric loads. It proposes the Lyapunov optimization technique (LOT) as a solution, emphasizing its ability to handle uncertainties without requiring anticipated system parameters. A similar study [11] paper acknowledges the challenges posed by the uncertain and intermittent nature of RES and consumer behavior in energy optimization. It proposes a comprehensive approach that combines probabilistic modeling of RES behavior, a hybrid scheme of demand response programs and incline block tariff, and multi-objective optimization algorithms to address these challenges. However, these studies can be enhanced by intelligent rule-based techniques and comparing them with parametrized cognitive adaptive approaches in a smart grid context. The directions imposed indicate a commitment to advancing the field by exploring alternative methodologies. This makes the sense or importance of knowledge extraction on system-specific existing energy trends. The work presented in [12] emphasized a deep learning framework for building energy management offers a promising approach to visualizing energy profiles, predicting future consumption, and providing valuable insights for effective energy utilization by capturing temporal dependencies and patterns in energy usage data. Similarly, a systematic approach to accurately predict electricity consumption ratings for residential buildings, leveraging data mining techniques and optimization algorithms provided in [13]. As Building energy management plays a crucial role in this aspect, the study [14] provides valuable insights into energy use characteristics of different types of buildings in higher education campuses, offering benchmark values derived from a robust statistical technique. This benchmark system can effectively guide universities in promoting energy efficiency and informing future planning developments. It is also clear that the benchmarking approach will be commendable when the study details the exploration of factors/energy performance drivers. However, identifying the most suitable HES configuration for a specific location requires a comprehensive understanding of technical, socio-economic, and environmental factors. Techno-economic feasibility studies have emerged as a widely adopted approach to determine the optimal HES configuration, taking into account a range of multidimensional variables. Relatively, the paper [15] introduces an approach by integrating demand\u2013supply management with particle swarm optimization for the design optimization of off-grid hybrid renewable energy systems. Though the results demonstrate significant improvements in energy demand reduction and total net present cost compared to conventional supply-side management techniques, the approach fails to disclose impact under varying environmental conditions and energy demand profiles which would enhance the robustness and applicability of the model. The comprehensive analysis on tracing optimal energy configuration presented in [16] renders an insight into analyzing HES's performance driving factors. The fundamental features of technical, economic, and environmental factors dictate the effectiveness of optimal energy configuration in any smart building, on modeling. The majority of recent research articles considered the HOMER tool for analyzing energy resources due to the limitations of the dynamic nature of system-specific variables. Following Table 1 is an assortment of such articles using the HOMER Optimizer. Following that, the evaluation of hybrid energy systems in all possible aspects is also essentially to be addressed [43] as it varies with the location site of the study and available energy sources. Multi-criteria Decision analysis is a profitable validation approach for analyzing and tracing the best among alternatives/choices [36]. The approach validates the system in design aspects for comparing and tracing optimal one [44]. In the case of SSM [45], suitable energy configuration among hybrid energy sources of the system can be obtained [46]. Of MCDM approaches, Best-Worst Method [46], PROMETHEE [47], SAW, COPRAS, VIKOR [48], TOPSIS [44], and Fuzzy AHP [49] are adopted predominantly. In this context, the paper proposes the TID-SEM (Three-tier Integrated Demand −Supply Energy Management) framework, which offers a systematic approach to assess and optimize building energy management strategies. From the global context outlined above, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of renewable energy integration, demand-side management, and the role of hybrid energy systems in achieving sustainable energy objectives. By leveraging the insights gained from these discussions, the TID-SEM framework offers a robust methodology for addressing energy challenges and promoting sustainable development at the building level. The framework adopted in an institutional building block to bridle the grey area of previous studies and pointed out the principal contributions to the field of research in building energy management and optimization as follows. \u2022 Development of TID-SEM Framework − a novel framework, TID-SEM (Three tiered Integrated Demand-Side Energy Management), which offers a systematic approach to address the complexities associated with energy consumption, demand variability, and renewable energy integration in buildings. \u2022 Smart Meter Integration and Categorization − By affixing smart meters to monitor building consumption and categorizing appliances into different load types (Inflexible, Flexible Tractable, and Flexible Intractable), provides a granular understanding of energy usage patterns. \u2022 Demand-Side Management Strategies − The implementation of load shifting based on machine learning decision tree classifiers leverages advanced analytics and automation to optimize energy usage in real-time, enhancing efficiency and cost-effectiveness. \u2022 Techno-Enviro-Economic Analysis − considering factors such as productivity, emission rates, and economic viability, provides a holistic assessment of various energy source combinations and the analysis with the HOMER simulator offers insights into the trade-offs and synergies between different energy options, facilitating informed decision-making. \u2022 Multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) Validation − integration of multi-criteria decision-making techniques, Fuzzy AHP, Fuzzy TOPSIS, and Fuzzy PROMETHEE, introduces a novel approach to prioritizing energy configurations based on diverse criteria. This methodology accounts for the complex interplay of technical, environmental, and economic factors, enhancing the decision-making process. \u2022 Sensitivity Analysis − highlights the resilience of the framework and assesses the impact of critical parameters, solar irradiation, and load variation, on the preferred energy configuration, adding a layer of robustness and adaptability to the proposed system. On the whole, the combination of innovative methodologies, advanced analytics, and holistic decision support tools distinguishes this TID-SEM framework as a novel contribution to the field of building energy management research that has the potential to drive significant advancements in optimizing energy usage and sustainability in buildings. The research article is collimated as follows: Section 2 expounds exact location and details of the test system. Section 3 gives a methodical overview of the Proposed TID-SEM framework whilst section 4 detailly interprets TID-SEM from Demand appraisal to MCDM validation as a brief note. Then section 5 discloses the insight preliminaries of the TID-SEM framework as Results and deliberation and finally, the article concludes in section 6. 2 State of art of the test system − TCE In accordance with the map shown in Fig. 1 , the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering building at Thiagarajar College of Engineering, located in Madurai district, Tamil Nadu, India, is considered a test system. The exact stance of the EEE block is at Thiruparankundram, Madurai, stationed at 9°53\u2032 N latitude and 78°4.5\u2032 E longitude. For almost 500 students, the department offers Under Grade, Post Grade, and Doctoral degrees. The department encompasses 24 faculty, 21 supporting faculties, and 83 research scholars. The extensive infrastructure of educational institutions and technological breakthroughs lead to an inordinate demand for energy. The laboratories have a significant role in energy cravings since the department has eight outstanding and well-infrastructure laboratories, as shown in Fig. 2 , with a typical working timeslot from 9:00:00 to 18:00:00. The department encompasses eight highly equipped laboratories, which are the Applied Electronics Lab, P.G Lab, Control Lab, Project/ Simulation Lab, Power Electronics Lab, Embedded Lab, and Computer Lab. Typically, laboratory sessions are conducted for two consecutive periods: one from 11:15:00 to 13:15:00 and the other from 14:15:00 to 16:15:00 Concerning the TCE follow-up, the schedule for each laboratory completely depends on Day order follow-up. The following is a summary of some popularly known lab usage patterns in TCE. \u2022 Since the project and P.G. laboratories are intended for research and P.G. academics, they will be accessible constantly from 9:00:00 to 18:00:00. \u2022 Power electronics will only be offered during the even semester of the academic year, while the embedded laboratory will have an active session only during the odd semester. \u2022 Correspondingly, the machines lab will run AC machines in the even semester and DC machines during the odd semester. Hence, affixed smart energy meters around the building block allow customers to have records on energy generation and consumption with the aid of a central server system and ElNet Elmeasure's software. The gathered continuous time series data gets saved in the cloud and can be retrieved in the future to local windows upon request. Focusing on the TCE's source of supply, the campus main block has four sources: a 300kVA HT Grid supply, a 450 kW net PV solar panel system with 1kWh lead acid battery storage, and a 380kVA diesel generator system shown in Fig. 2. As the accounted system is an educational institution, it utilizes a broad array of high-end appliances that must operate within standard time slots and stay below the building's maximum demand limit. Currently, the institution manually manages four supply sources [PV + Battery + Diesel generator + Grid], lacking strategic procedures or follow-ups for efficient load utilization and resource management. This absence of systematic attention leads to potential energy wastage and penalties. Therefore, it is essential to adopt a structured approach to both load scheduling and resource utilization in the building. On understanding the supply and demand dynamics, a coherent framework is recommended. 3 Methodology The proposed TID-SEM methodology is illustrated in Fig. 3 . This framework represents a sequence of interconnected events, beginning with data collection and culminating in the development of an optimal energy strategy. 3.1 Outset: Data collection and Categorization To achieve comprehensive knowledge and information extraction, data on the available loads and their utilization ratio were jointly collected to assess consumer's comfort levels for each appliance within the workspace. Additionally, existing energy utilization data is required for an in-depth analysis to propose remedial actions for improving building energy performance as a whole. This consumption data is gathered using smart energy meters installed throughout the department. The data retrieved from the cloud often includes various issues such as outliers, noisy data, inconsistent time/date formats, and missing values, all of which must be meticulously addressed for significant improvement. 3.2 Tier − 1: Machine learning-based Demand Side Management A machine learning-based decision tree classifier Random Forest was utilized as a time series classifier. Initially, the algorithm is supplied with data on available loads, smart meters, and cohesive energy records. It is trained to prioritize workspace usage within specific time slots, labeled as Peak, Normal, and Off-Peak. The classifier evaluates and assigns the precedence of classified loads in the workspace, ensuring that the maximum demand limit is neither violated nor exceeded. 3.3 Tier − 2: Techno-Enviro-Economic Assessment for Supply-Side Management As previously stated, the test system incorporates renewable PV solar, battery storage, diesel generation, and grid sources. Load trends with and without DSM are fed as input to the HOMER simulator for cross-analyzing three source configurations under two distinguished DSM scenarios, resulting in six simulation configurations. Scaled-down values of the four energy sources are used for feasibility analysis. Simulation outcomes based on techno-environmental-economic aspects, along with constraints are assessed. 3.4 Tier − 3: Validating and tracing optimal strategy Ultimately, the optimal energy configuration among the six configurations is determined using the Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) approach. MCDM is employed to address complex decision-making problems by selecting the best alternative based on predetermined criteria and sub-criteria. Out of various MCDM techniques available, three Fuzzy sets of MCDM, namely Fuzzy AHP, Fuzzy TOPSIS, and Fuzzy PROMETHEE, are utilized for ranking and identifying the best energy configuration. 4 TID-SEM framework The TID-SEM framework is a sequence of interconnected events conducted sequentially, starting with data collection and concluding with determining the optimal energy strategy through outranking. The study conducted at Thiagarajar College of Engineering focuses on a hybrid renewable energy system (HRES), aiming to achieve efficient utilization of both loads and available energy resources, as depicted in Fig. 4 . This objective is attainable through comprehensive consumption deduction using a prudent demand-side management approach under a nominal supply strategy. 4.1 Outset: Data collection and categorization To ensure accurate knowledge acquisition, data on the usage times of connected loads within the workspace are collected. Additionally, existing records of energy consumption are necessary for in-depth analysis and to propose effective measures for enhancing building energy performance. Energy usage patterns specific to workspace user comfort, outlined in Annexure A1, are initially obtained. Subsequently, the annual average consumption for each method is calculated using time series smart records retrieved from the cloud. These data often come with various issues, such as outliers, inconsistent data, and missing values, which require careful handling for significant improvement. Therefore, to extract precise knowledge regarding the consumption trend of the test system, a half-yearly semestral pattern following academic norms is adopted, aligning with the TCE academic calendar. The odd semester spans from the last week of June to the second week of December, while the even semester runs from the first week of January to the first week of May. Load scheduling is then formulated based on time and device categories. 4.1.1 Time categorization It's vital to establish an optimal schedule for academic activities within the workspaces to efficiently operate all available loads in the building block. With only eight out of 24 h allocated for academic activities, the calculation of the net load intended for operation during these scheduled hours is depicted in Equation (1). (1) ∑ t = 1 9 Q 1 + ∑ t = 9 18 Q 2 + ∑ t = 18 24 Q 3 = Q q where tk indicates the time of day and Qq is the actual average daily demand. Since only a limited and precise number of appliances are planned to switch ON from 6:00:00 p.m. to 9:00:00 a.m. the consumption ratio is as per Equation (2), (2) ∑ t = 1 9 Q 1 = ∑ t = 18 24 Q 3 Each workstation is given precedence in each intermittently scheduled time slot despite taking academic follow-up in TCE into account. Official working hours commence from 9:00:00 to 17:00:00 and the rest of non-working hours from 18:00:00 to 9:00:00 make up the distinguished 24 h of a day. 4.1.2 Device categorization Fig. 5 illustrates the combined net connected loads of the EEE department building block, categorized into three distinct tags: Inflexible loads (IFL), Flexible Tractable loads (FTLs), and Flexible Intractable Loads (FITLs). All load categories are assumed to commence operation at the initiation time in te and cease operation by the final time fn te i.e., over pre-defined time slot n over a 24-hour timescale t . Load status switching is denoted by 0/1 for OFF/ON status. 4.1.2.1 Inflexible loads (IFLs) A specific category of loads operates continuously, 24*7 without any intervention unless persist the demand for replacement. These appliances, such as routers, cameras, automated doorbells, and digital clocks, are classified under the inflexible loads category. They do not require powering on or off unless maintenance or replacement is necessary during their lifetime. Let a \u2032 denote the total number of active loads at any given time, irrespective of the workspace, as defined in Equation (3). L e t a \u2032 = 1 , 2 , ⋯ , A ∈ IFLs n = 1 , 2 , ⋯ , 24 A a \u2032 = A a \u2032 1 , A a \u2032 2 ⋯ , A a \u2032 24 (3) A ^ a \u2032 = 1 , ∀ n ∈ t 4.1.2.2 Flexible Tractable loads (FTLs) Flexible Tractable loads are considered secondary or deferrable, aimed at enhancing comfort levels but can be controlled and operated intermittently. Examples include water dispensers, air conditioners, UPS systems, battery backups, exhaust fans, EV chargers, wall-mounted fans, and pedestal fans. Interrupting or adjusting their operating hours would not adversely affect the department's academic schedule. These loads are typically operated during off-schedule working hours, such as from 8:00 to 9:00 and from 13:15 to 14:15. Let b \u2032 represent the number of appliances scheduled to operate during the time interval n as defined in Equation (4). The priority hierarchy is based on the provided list. L e t b \u2032 = 1 , 2 , ⋯ , B ∈ STLs n = 8 , 8.15 , ⋯ , 9 + 13 , 13.15 , ⋯ 14.15 Bb ' = B b ' 8 ⋯ B b ' 9 + B b ' 13 : 25 ⋯ E b ' 14 : 25 (4) B ^ b \u2032 = 1 , i f i n t e ≤ n ≤ f n t e a n d T x m < T x m a x 0 , i f n < i n t e o r n > f n t e 4.1.2.3 Flexible Intractable loads (FITLs) Flexible Intractable loads, essential for academic activities and unable to be scheduled to specific time slots, comprise LED lights, fans, projectors, printers, computers, and sound systems, commonly found in most workspaces. However, the utilization proportion of these loads may vary depending on workspace, occupancy, and external environmental factors. Thus, these indispensable loads are operated based on consumer choice and are not frequently interrupted. In summary, they are prioritized as primary, critical, or non-deferrable for user comfort. Let c \u2032 represent the number of appliances scheduled to operate during the time interval i from 9:00:00 to 18:00:00 concerning the workspace, as stated in Equation (5). The priority hierarchy aligns with the provided list. L e t c \u2032 = 1 , 2 , ⋯ , C ∈ FITLs n = 9 , 10 ⋯ 18 C c \u2032 = C c \u2032 9 + C c \u2032 10 + ⋯ + C c \u2032 18 (5) C ̂ c \u2032 = 1 , i f i n t e ≤ n ≤ f n t e a n d T x m < T x m a x 0 , i f n < i n t e o r n > f n t e After surveying connected loads, load-based categorization is established as described above. Energy consumption meter records spanning approximately 1.5 years, from February 2021 to October 2022, are retrieved from the cloud using Elmeasure's Elnet software. These records provide mean nominal energy patterns on an hourly scale for every month. The data is then divided into semesters and aggregated to generate average hourly energy traces before Demand-Side Management (DSM) under the label 'B_DSM' energy trace. 4.2 Tier 1: Machine learning based DSM implementation In tier 2, the DSM phase of TID-SEM visualizes the contingency of the achieved energy pattern with the existing actual meter trend semestral-wise. A Machine learning-based Decision tree (DT) classifier − Random Forest (RF) adopted and employed as a time series classifier. This supervised ML algorithm dealt with both classification and regression. Generically, RF builds a set of DT randomly from the chosen subset of training data and collectively makes a final decision. The Cloud retrieved energy consumption data after the preprocessing stages and fed it to the Decision Tree classifier to have \u2018B_DSM\u2019 energy traces. The data with a five-minute resolution is redeemed on resampling to have an hourly timestamp. Well before that, every 15 min of data was aggregated to have a deep sense of probable maximum demand limit to avoid the overall penalties and peak demand reach. The metered data along with user preferences and category is fed to the classifier as shown in the flow graph of Fig. 6 . The model is trained tested and validated at the ratio of 7:2:1. The time series data is initially preprocessed to have a coherent data source at hourly timestamp. With a special \u2018Calendar function\u2019, working, non-working weekends, and public holidays are disaggregated. Accounting working days with \u2018month\u2019 as an attribute, odd semester and even semester follow-up tenure are extracted solely. Successively, with the \u2018time\u2019 attribute, working and non-working hours are tagged along with the workspace priority. At this phase, the existing average semestral energy traces are retrieved. Then at each timestamp, loads in the rest workspace other than the prioritized workspace are scheduled over the working time slot to have energy traces after the mentioned DSM procedure. Since it is also mandatory for the developed hybrid algorithm to ensure satisfactory load utilization without reaching the possible peak demand value, the energy trace A_DSM can be achieved by ensuring the constraints. The net demand following scheduling should align with the net demand prior to scheduling, as outlined in Equation (6). (6) ∑ t = 9 18 T x b d s m = ∑ t = 9 18 T x a d s m The demand occurring at any given moment within the consumer premises must always be equal to or less than the potential maximum power demand calculated at fifteen-minute intervals in the time series record, as outlined in Equation (7). (7) T x m ≤ T x m a x where, T x b d s m is the actual energy trend prior to DSM incorporation. T x a d s m is the achieved energy trend after indulging DSM. T x m is the precise demand at that specific moment. T x m a x is the potential maximum demand range, which gets updated every 15 min. Following this, the net tariff involved on a day basis is computed under the ToU tariff structure. The separate estimation for both Even and Odd semesters is achieved concerning B_DSM and A_DSM energy curves. The tariff structure is charted in Table 2 , referring to which energy cost/day is estimated. 4.3 Tier 2 techno-enviro-economic assessment for SSM As previously noted, the study system comprises a renewable PV solar system, battery backup, diesel generation, and grid. The load profiles acquired before and after demand-side management (DSM) from Tier 1 are input into the HOMER simulation software to assess technical, environmental, and economic considerations. 4.3.1 Location-specific resources The software is initialized with the precise TCE campus building block coordinates 9°53\u2032 N and 78°4.5\u2032 E, which corresponds to Thiruparankundram in the Madurai district, Tamil Nadu, India. Subsequently, specific renewable resource data, including Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI), clearness index, and temperature, for that particular location are obtained from the NREL. Fig. 7 illustrates that the clearness index ranges from 0.5 to 0.6, with GHI varying between 4.50 and 6.60 kWh/m2/day and temperatures ranging from 24 °C to 31 °C. Notably, the annual mean solar irradiance GHI is approximately 5.61 kWh/m2/day, with the hikes in March. 4.3.2 Economical feed in details for simulator To model and simulate the wholesome energy system economic inputs need to be initialized separately for each energy source. The purchase rate for electricity supplied by the electricity board is set at $0.100 per kWh. The details of all four supply sources are listed in Table 3 . Data on each of these sources has been specifically examined for load patterns before and after the incorporation of DSM. 4.3.3 Supply configurations For the test system under consideration, there are four available sources of supply, resulting in six supply configurations under two scenarios: B_DSM and A_DSM, as depicted in Fig. 8 . The representation also indicates that the nominal daily consumption range is approximately 600 kWh, with a maximum consumption of 153.90 kW prior to the implementation of DSM. After incorporating DSM, the peak consumption decreases to about 133.63 kW. Schema 1: Before DSM Supply Config_PV + G [B_DSM] PV solar + Utility grid Supply Config_PV + B + G [B_DSM] PV solar + Battery + Utility grid Supply Config_PV + DG + G [B_DSM] PV solar + Diesel generation + Utility grid Schema 2: After DSM Supply Config_PV + G [B_DSM] PV solar + Utility grid Supply Config_PV + B + G [A_DSM] PV solar + Battery + Utility grid Supply Config_PV + DG + G [A_DSM] PV solar + Diesel generation + Utility grid 4.3.3.1 PV Solar and Grid combination The PV and grid combination of supply forms the simplest energy configuration. Based on the extracted knowledge on both sources and demand trends, HOMER suggests source priority as follows. Always renewable resources are highly prioritized for usage. For the considered system with PV solar and grid, PV initially tries to meet out power demanded by the load and utilizes the grid as a secondary source as in Fig. 9 . 4.3.3.2 PV Solar, Battery, and Grid combination The next combination is upgraded with a battery storage system. Similar to PV and grid combination of supply but gets slightly modified with the Battery\u2019s charging and discharging phases. Based on the available sources to meet the exact demand, HOMER suggests source priority as follows. Well, known that renewable resources are initially prioritized for usage as in the flow. Added to that, the charging and discharging schedules of the storage backup match up with the flow chart. The three possible source combos to meet load as in Fig. 10 are, (i) only solar, (ii) solar and battery, and (iii) all three solar, battery, and grid. 4.3.3.3 PV Solar, Diesel generator, and Grid combination The primitive configuration PV and Grid is accompanied by a Diesel generator to form a combination of triple sources \u2013 solar PV, utility grid, and DG. HOMER software\u2019s priority of utilization for this combination is depicted in the flow chart shown in Fig. 11 . This combination also resulted in either of three possible supply sets of combos to feed load namely, (i) only solar, (ii) solar and grid, and (iii) only DG. From the survey, most of the study accounts for DG. But considering the Indian system, DG is found to be operated on the worst case concerning various expenditures. 4.3.4 Techno − Enviro-Economic factors Each of above mentioned configurations is analysed under techno-enviro-economic listed out with delineation in Table 4 . Of, which most determining factor is picked out for further evaluation. 4.4 Tier 3 MCDM for supply-demand management validation Moreover, to underscore the importance and urgency of an integrated supply and demand strategy in enhancing overall building energy efficiency, mathematical modeling employing a Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) approach is introduced. As the term implies, MCDM is commonly employed to address intricate decision-making problems concerning the selection of optimal alternatives based on pre-confined criteria. From a wide array of options available, the study focuses on three prominent MCDM techniques: Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (Fuzzy AHP), Fuzzy Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (Fuzzy TOPSIS), and Fuzzy Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluation (Fuzzy PROMETHEE). These methods are deemed promising for identifying the best config, as provided in Fig. 12 . 4.4.1 Fuzzy AHP Fuzzy AHP is the conventional and potential method of MCDM in handling uncertain and complex problems. It is a weightage-based method usually incorporated to avoid ambiguity with human perceptions among choices and Phases involved are extracted from [50]. 4.4.1.1 Phase 1: Establishing fuzzy pairwise matrix The linguistic variables are inserted to denote the relative significance of each pair of elements considering fuzzy triangular values (Annexure A2). Based on experts\u2019 opinions the pair-wise representation of all criteria and alternatives is accomplished in Tables 5 & 6 . A ij = A 11 A 12 A 12 - 1 A 22 ⋯ A 1 n A 2 n ⋮ ⋱ ⋮ A n 1 - 1 A n 2 - 1 ⋯ A mn A ij = l i j , m i j , u i j a n d A ij - 1 = 1 uij , 1 mij , 1 lij 4.4.1.2 Phase 2: Aggregation of expert\u2019s opinion The values are aggregated by geometric mean expressed in Eq. (8). (8) r i = ∏ i = 1 n A ij n 4.4.1.3 Phase 3: Determination of fuzzy values for criteria and alternatives The fuzzified values can be obtained in three procedural steps as follows, i By vector sum of each r i ∑ i = 1 n r i = r i 1 ⊕ r i 2 ⊕ \u2026 ⊕ r in ii By inverse vector sum ∑ i = 1 n r i - 1 = r i 1 ⊕ r i 2 ⊕ \u2026 ⊕ r in - 1 iii By multiplying each r i with increasing inverse vector W i = r i ⊕ r i 1 ⊕ r i 2 ⊕ r i 3 \u2026 ⊕ r in - 1 = l W i + m W i + u W i 4.4.1.4 Phase 4: Defuzzification on normalization To attain crisp values of relative non-fuzzy weight, the triangular fuzzy values are defuzzied by the Center of Area method as in Eq. (10). (10) M i = l W i + m W i + u W i 3 Then the normalized weights are obtained by Eq (11). (11) N i = M i ∑ n = 1 N M i The exact procedure from Phase 1 to Phase 4 is followed for pair-wise comparison of alternatives in accordance with each criterion as shown in Tables 7, 8 & 9 . 4.4.1.5 Phase 5: Ranking of alternatives The approach finally ranks the alternatives in accordance with normalized weights as in Table 10 . The ranks are evaluated using a sum of the product (SoP) of transposed normalized weights of alternatives. The highest SoP indicates the best alternative which is configuration 3 with PV + G combination after incorporation of DSM. 4.4.2 Fuzzy PROMETHEE Fuzzy PROMETHEE is the finest MCDM technique meant for complex problems. It is a priority-based method that quantifies expert\u2019s opinions on different criteria and attains optimum. The principle behind choosing the best is based on evaluating Hamming distance. The steps involved are as follows [52], Phase 1: Aggregated ratings from experts First of all decision from a committee of experts EX (x = 1, 2 \u2026X) is collected, and then the fuzzy rating of each decision can be represented as a trapezoidal fuzzy number (Annexure A3) as shown in Table 11 & Table 12 . Phase 2: Formation of Combined Decision matrix Aggregation of fascinatings and criteria weights (Fuzzy values) of alternatives with respective criteria as in Eq.(12) & Eq.(13). Q u v = a uv , b uv , c uv , d uv (12) a uv = min x a uv x ; b uv = 1 X ∑ x = 1 X b uv x ; c uv = 1 X ∑ x = 1 X c uv x ; d uv = max x d uv x Then the fuzzy weights ( ω j = ω j l , ω j p , ω j q , ω j u ) of each criterion are aggregated as (13) ω v l = min x ω v l x ; ω v p = 1 X ∑ x = 1 X ω v p x ; ω v q = 1 X ∑ x = 1 X ω v q x ; ω v u = max x ω v u x v = 1 , 2 , ⋯ , m a n d u = 1 , 2 , ⋯ , n The first edition matrix is also constructed as D = Q 11 Q 12 Q 21 Q 22 ⋯ Q 1 n Q 2 n ⋮ ⋱ ⋮ Q m 1 Q m 2 ⋯ Q mn W = ω 1 , ω 2 , ⋯ , ω m Which can be initialized by trapezoidal fuzzy numbers as in Table 13 . Phase 3: Computing Normalized Fuzzy Decision Matrix The fuzzy decision matrix is normalized with the linear normalization formula separately for benefit and cost criteria in Eq. (15) & Eq. (16) as follows R = r uv m ∗ n (14) r ij = a uv d v ∗ , b uv d v ∗ , c uv d v ∗ , d uv d v ∗ w h e r e v ∈ მ B (15) r ij = a v ∗ d uv , a v ∗ c uv , a v ∗ b uv , a v ∗ a uv w h e r e v ∈ მ C Then, weighted by the product of essential evaluation criteria weights with the values of the normalized first decision matrix i.e., Z uv = r uv ∗ W j . Then fuzzy weighted normalized decision matrix Z is defined as shown in Table 14 . Z = Z 11 Z 12 Z 21 Z 22 ⋯ Z 1 n Z 2 n ⋮ ⋱ ⋮ Z m 1 Z m 2 ⋯ Z mn Z uv = r uv ∗ W v W v represents the weightage of criterion v. Phase 4: Estimating Hamming distance Generically, the Hamming distance method is adopted for comparative analysis of two alternatives r and s on each criterion as in Eq. (16). Initially maximum of two numbers is picked out. max Z rv , Z sv As the last upper marginal bound is determined by finding the maximum, the hamming distance d is given by d max Z rv , Z sv , Z rv a n d d max Z rv , Z sv , Z sv are calculated. Z rv ≥ Z sv i f a n d o n l y i f , d max Z rv , Z sv , Z sv ≥ d max Z rv , Z sv , Z sv Otherwise, Z rv < Z sv i f a n d o n l y i f , d max Z rv , Z sv , Z sv < d max Z rv , Z sv , Z sv (16) P j r , s = d max Z rv , Z sv , Z rv Z rv < Z sv d max Z rv , Z sv , Z rv Z rv ≥ Z sv The value of the outranking, Fuzzy Preference Index is determined by relation in Eq. (17) (17) Π r , s = ∑ v = 1 n W v . P v r , s ∑ v = 1 n W v Phase 5: Computing Leaving and Entering Flow The ranking of alternatives is made by computing Entering and leaving flows with Eq. (18) & Eq. (19) and the resultant are as shown in Table 15 . (18) ξ ( r ) + = ∑ s ≠ r s = 1 m Π r , s (19) ξ ( r ) - = ∑ s ≠ r s = 1 n Π r , s Phase 6: Ranking of alternatives Net flow is calculated as the difference between ξ ( r ) + a n d ξ ( r ) - and with which the final preference rank of each alternative is evaluated as in Table 16 . The topmost preference indicates the best alternative which is configuration 3 with PV + G combination after incorporation of DSM. 4.4.3 Fuzzy TOPSIS Fuzzy TOPSIS is the first-rate MCDM technique with high precision in attaining optimal solutions for higher-end problems. The method quantifies expert\u2019s opinions on different criteria. The principle behind choosing the best is estimation with respect to separation distance from an ideal solution. The [51] used for the procedural follow-up in this method. Phase 1: Aggregated ratings from experts With the expert\u2019s opinion, linguistic ratings are expressed as triangular fuzzy numbers (Annexure A3) for each technical, economic, and environmental criterion as shown in Tables 17 & 18 . Phase 2: Formation of Combined Decision Matrix A single decision matrix is built concerning the techno-enviro-economic outcomes and further criterion weights are estimated by Eq. (20) & Eq.(21) and the resultants are tabulated as shown in Table 19 . Q u v = a uv , b uv , c uv (20) a uv = min x a uv x ; b uv = 1 X ∑ x = 1 X b uv x ; c uv = max x c uv x Then the fuzzy weights ( ω j = ω j l , ω j p , ω j u ) of each criterion are aggregated as (21) ω v l = min x ω v l x ; ω v p = 1 X ∑ x = 1 X ω v p x ; ω v u = max x ω v u x v = 1 , 2 , ⋯ , m a n d u = 1 , 2 , ⋯ , n Phase 3: Computing Fuzzy Normalized Decision Matrix The fuzzy decision matrix is normalized by the linear normalization formula, separate expression for benefit and cost criteria as in Eq. (22) & Eq. (23) R = r uv m ∗ n (22) r ij = a uv c v ∗ , b uv c v ∗ , c uv c v ∗ , w h e r e v ∈ მ B b e n e f i t c r i t e r i a (23) r ij = a v ∗ c uv , a v ∗ b uv , a v ∗ a uv w h e r e v ∈ მ C ( c o s t c r i t e r i a ) Then, weighted by the product of essential evaluation criteria weights with the values of the normalized first decision matrix i.e., V uv = r uv ∗ W v . Then fuzzy weighted normalized decision matrix V is defined as shown in Table 20 . Phase 4: Computing Fuzzy Positive and negative ideal solutions The computation of fuzzy positive ideal solution enables attributes with maximal benefit criteria by Eq. (24) and minimal cost criteria whilst fuzzy negative ideal solution enables attributes with maximal cost criteria and minimal benefit criteria by Eq. (25) as in Table 21 . (24) I s + = I s 1 + , I s 2 + , ⋯ , I s n + w h e r e I s n + = max x I s ij + (25) I s - = I s 1 - , I s 2 - , ⋯ , I s n - w h e r e I s n - = min x I s ij - Phase 5: Computing Closeness coefficient Closeness coefficient C C is calculated as in Eq. (26) by considering the separation distance between FPIS and FNIS of each alternative. The resultant is obtained on procedural computation as follows and is shown in Table 22 . d I s uv , I s + uv = 1 3 I s uv a - Is va + 2 + I s uv b - Is vb + 2 + I s uv b - I s vb + 2 d I s uv , I s - uv = 1 3 Is uv a - Is va - 2 + I s uv b - Is vb - 2 + I s uv b - Is vb - 2 X + = ∑ d I s uv , I s + uv X - = ∑ d I s uv , I s - uv (26) C C = X - X + + X - Phase 6: Ranking of alternatives − With C C the ranking of alternatives is made in descending fashion as shown in Table, the maximal C C indicates the best alternative which is config 3 with PV + G combination after incorporation of DSM. 5 Results and discussion The findings from distinguished tiers of the TID-SEM framework are consolidated to provide detailed insights for integrating building energy management strategies. These results are presented through tabulations and graphs, as demonstrated in the subsequent sections. 5.1 Outcome of outset phase_TID-SEM − categorization The department building block is affixed with a total of 10 smart meters to cover the consumption of the building. Of which 8 belong to highly equipped laboratories, the other two are meant to trace the ratio of supply fetched from PV and Utility grid. As no tariff is involved with the self-consumption from PV, the study accounted for SB2 EEE feeder data of TCE along with 8 sub-laborational meter data. Based on the user preferences, each appliances are tagged under either of the categories Inflexible loads \u2013 IFLs (I), Flexible Tractable loads − FTLs (II), and Flexible Intractable Loads \u2013 FITLs (III) as tabulated in Table 23 . Considering the time constraint and time-based priority, each workspace is stuck to a specific time slot and demand range. Following that, with reference to the TCE academic calendar, a half-yearly semestral pattern of the academic norms is accounted as an odd semester and even semester for better vision. As mentioned earlier the odd semester falls between the last week of June to the second week of December. While the even semester falls between the first week of January to the first week of May. The above-mentioned 8 energy meter data is agglomerated with SB2 meter data as per the even/odd duration and properly modified at hourly timestamp to have B_DSM plots i.e., actual consumption plot as shown in Fig. 13 which successively fed to ml algorithm to predict and give suggestive load curve upon appropriate scheduling in tier 2. 5.2 Outcome of tier 1_TID-SEM \u2013 DSM The role of DSM in the proposed TID-SEM is inevitable as it indulges in proper scheduling of loads to reduce average peak consumptions and thereby energy tariff under the ToU tariff structure. To initialize the approach, the consolidated mean consumption in Odd and Even semesters of the building is studied. The nominal peak hours are observed from 11:00:00 to 13:00:00 in the odd semester while that of even from 12:00:00 to 2:00:00. The employed machine learning decision tree classifier Random Forest, allocates appropriate loads in each workspace and retrieves the net suggestive modified load curve as shown in Figs. 14 & 15 . The shifting is entirely based on loads prioritized in each workspace on categorization. In addition, the average hourly consumption under the ToU tariff structure is visualized in Fig. 16 & Fig. 17 to vary the reduction in tariff/day. The tariff for per day consumption in the EEE department of TCE is observed as Rs. 3616.48/ day and Rs.3971.61/day in the Even and Odd semesters whilst it is reduced to Rs. 3612.66/day and 3953.89/day respectively as shown in Figs. 15 & 16. Though it was found to have slight variation, it creates a massive impact on annual expenditure on fetching from the utility grid. The load-shifting DSM strategy evolved in the process with sustained Net demand per day of 447.2 kW/day and 487.85 kW/day over the Even and Odd semesters respectively. But the peak demand over the actual energy trend was deduced from 52.6 kW to 50.9 kW in the Even semester while from 54.63 kW to 49.499 kW in the odd semester. This drift created a considerable percentage dip in PAR /day. It is observed that 3.168 % drop in Even and triple the range of 9.393 % drop in Odd semester as shown in Table 24 . The graphical representation of Peak demand, average demand, and corresponding Peak-to-Average Ratio is shown in Fig. 18 . The value of average demand remains about the same in both actual and achieved energy trends but Peak got around 3 % and 9 % deduction in the Even and the Odd semesters. 5.3 Outcome of tier 2_TID-SEM \u2013 SSM Two distinguished sets of demand patterns with and without DSM achieved from tier 1 are fed separately to the HOMER simulator to investigate the techno-enviro-economic features of optimized resultant under all three energy source combos. So, this phase of analysis evolves as tier 2 of the TID-SEM framework. The optimizer is highly meant to validate the supply end characteristics and challenges in continual supply. For the test system with PV array, battery bank, and DG set along with the grid, it estimates the average consumption over a day as 600kWh having a peak of 153.90 kW before DSM energy demand traces whilst the peak reduced to 133.63 kW after DSM traces. Hence promising comparison of energy configurations is done for respective DSM scenarios using the bottom-line features such as productivity, consumption range, emission, and expenditure as shown in Table 25 and Table 26 . The analysis remnants all the odds among techno-enviro-economic constraints to choose the most optimal energy source combination. Towards which each combination is compared under respective DSM scenarios i.e., PV + G configs, PV + B + G configs, and PV + DG + G configs are compared. On the whole, the test system consumption rate is reduced from 219,000 kWh/yr to 216,000 kWh/yr i.e., 1.37 % quite possible. The Techno-Enviro-Economic assessment of energy configurations concerning DSM considers the following factors such as PV solar array, Grid purchase range, Net productivity, PV capacity factor (%), Renewable fraction (%), Total consumption, CO2 emission, SO2 emission, and NO emission, Initial cost ($), Total NPC ($), Operating cost ($/yr), and COE ($/kW). From the two resultant tabulations Table 25 and Table 26, it is clear that Total consumption (kWh/yr) and Grid purchase (kWh/yr) under the technical category, CO2 emission of environmental category, and lastly NPC, LCOE, and Operating cost of economic factors are traced to be the highly influencing factors in each configuration as shown in Fig. 19 . The resultant of the techno-enviro-economic analysis of the PV + G combination is shown in Fig. 20 . Accounting from a technical point of view, a combination with minimal grid purchase and maximal renewable fraction would be admissible. Here the combination\u2019s net annual requisite of grid supply is reduced from 200,893 kWh/yr to 197,810 kWh/yr whilst renewable fraction is increased from 9.60 % to 9.70 % on introducing DSM strategy. In the meantime moving to environmental factors, the annual emission rate of greenhouse gases such as CO2, SO2, and NO is also deduced to about 1.5 % due to the incorporation of the proposed DSM strategy. Similarly, economic factors such as NPC, initial capital, operating cost, and LCOE determine the elite. Initial capital will remain the same, albeit a system with low NPC, LCOE, and operating cost will be the better option. Of Configuration with PV + G as supplying source, PV + G [A_DSM] has comparative low NPC, LCOE, and operating costs of $289649, $0.102/kW, and $ 20114/year respectively. Owing to the PV + B + G combination in Fig. 21 , the overall techno-enviro-economic assessment shows that the combo is analogous to the PV + G combo. The upshots of the analysis delineate that comparatively lower grid purchase rate of 200,711 kWh/yr and 197,799 kWh/yr is observed with the same consignment of renewable fractions 9.60 % and 9.70 % in the respective DSM scenarios under technical aspects. Striking the environmental factors i.e., CO2, SO2, and NO emissions, no changes with SO2 and NO emissions whilst CO2 emission slightly reduced and reached 126849 kg/yr & 124889 kg/yr before and after the implementation of DSM. Next essential economic factors NPC and operating cost are deduced by 1.2 % and 1.5 % proportionately. Lastly focusing on techno-enviro-economic assessment of PV + DG + G combination in Fig. 22 . Technical factor grid purchase range is about 200,828 kWh/yr and 197,800 kWh/yr with a comparative least renewable fraction of 9.50 % and 9.68 % respectively. Focusing on the rest environmental and economic factors, there won\u2019t be many variations in SO2 and NO emissions but CO2 emission increases and attains the value of 126964 kg/yr & 125010 kg/yr correspondingly. Also, economic factors such as NPC and operating costs probably increase and attain values of $293899 and $20415/yr before DSM while $290913 and $20137/yr respectively. 5.4 Outcome of tier 3_TID-SEM \u2013 MCDM validation Summarizing to analyze the techno-enviro-economic factors of all the six configurations, the most promising and determining subfactors such as renewable fraction from technical factor, CO2 emission from environmental factor, and NPC from economic factor are accounted on min\u2013max normalization. Cognitively the normalized values are tabulated in Table 27 and represented graphically in Fig. 23 . Considering renewable fraction minimum is with PV + DG + G [B_DSM] and maximum is with PV + G [A_DSM] & PV + B + G [A_DSM]. Whereas accounting for CO2 emission is minimal with PV + B + G [A_DSM] and maximal with PV + DG + G [B_DSM]. Similarly, from the economic aspect NPC is minimal with PV + G [A_DSM] and maximum with PV + DG + G [B_DSM]. Thus, in sum, the PV + Grid [A_DSM] config was found as the more optimal configuration among all. Hence it should get high priority for efficacious building energy management. Still, the difficulty in prioritizing the rest configuration hierarchically persists due to drastic variations in techno-enviro-economic factors of configurations. To overcome this and obtain an appropriate solution, the MCDM approach is encompassed in the TID-SEM framework. The outcome of three Fuzzy ensembled MCDM approaches, Fuzzy AHP, Fuzzy TOPSIS, and Fuzzy PROMETHEE is sorted in Table 28 . It is evident that both weightage-based analysis and priority-based methods of MCDM outrank configuration 4 i.e., PV + G combination after DSM incorporation as the best as shown in Fig. 24 . In addition, all three MCDM techniques consider only the configurations after DSM which emphasizes the potential importance of Demand-side management in building energy management. 5.5 Sensitivity analysis of TID-SEM framework This section conducts sensitivity analysis to evaluate the influence of different factors\u2014Technical (Renewable Fraction), Environmental (Carbon Dioxide Emission), and Economic (Total Net Present Cost, NPC)\u2014on the most suitable energy configuration (PV-Grid after DSM). The analysis accounts for the uncertain variations in solar irradiation (Global Horizontal Irradiance, GHI) and load demand, modeled and simulated using HOMER simulation software. Solar irradiation ranges from 5.2 to 6.4 kWh/m2/day, while load demand varies from 520 to 600 kWh/day. The effects of these uncertain variations on the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) and total NPC are summarized in Table 29 . Results demonstrate that the PV-Grid after DSM configuration (PV + G [A_DSM]) remains the preferred choice irrespective of fluctuations in solar irradiation and load demand. Despite changes in these critical parameters, there are only minor variations in techno-enviro-economic factors. Notably, an increase in load demand results in a slight uptick in total NPC, rising from $250,640.8 to $290,443.9, indicating additional investments are needed to meet the demand. Similarly, variations in load demand lead to fluctuations in carbon dioxide emissions, ranging from 105,939.1 kg/yr to 125,398.1 kg/yr. Additionally, an increase in solar irradiation causes the Renewable Fraction to shift from 9.399693 % to a maximum of 11.6836 %. These findings highlight the consistent performance of the proposed PV-Grid after the DSM system as the optimal configuration for the study location, confirming its suitability across varying environmental and load conditions. Thus, the TID-SEM framework progresses methodically through its tiers, culminating in a comprehensive analysis of building energy management strategies. Beginning with categorization, it identifies load patterns based on user preferences and academic calendars. DSM implementation in Tier 1 optimizes load scheduling, significantly reducing peak demand and energy tariffs. Tier 2\u2032s simulation-based analysis evaluates energy source combinations, highlighting the effectiveness of DSM in reducing consumption and emissions. Tier 3 employs MCDM to prioritize configurations, emphasizing the superiority of PV + Grid post-DSM. Finally, sensitivity analysis confirms the resilience of the PV-Grid after DSM configuration to variations in critical parameters, affirming its suitability across diverse environmental and load conditions. In summary, the TID-SEM framework offers a structured approach to building energy management, integrating data-driven strategies to enhance efficiency, sustainability, and cost-effectiveness. 6 Conclusions An integrated demand-driven supply-side management study was conducted in an educational institution situated in Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India, through a strategic Three-tier Integrated Demand-Supply Energy Management (TID-SEM) approach. The TID-SEM integrates supply\u2013demand end by accounting Machine learning-based load scheduling upon categorization in Tier 1, then techno-enviro-economic feasibility analysis of three distinguished grid-tied supply configurations before and after DSM retrieved energy trends in Tier 2. The three distinguished energy configurations notably (i) PV solar + grid, (ii) PV solar + battery + grid, and finally (iii) PV solar, DG and grid. Erstwhile, in Tier 3 three Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) − mathematical modeling approaches F-AHP, F-TOPSIS, and F-PROMETHEE were integrated to amalgamate the obtained tier-wise outcome of infused demand\u2013supply side management and trace the most optimal one for the test system. The verdicts of the study on the test system are summarized below, \u2022 An alternative machine learning-based Random Forest classifier reduced the average peak hours of a day notably by 3.168 % and 9.393 % in Even and Odd semesters eventually sustaining the net demand range. Thereby there exists a probable reduction in the energy tariff in the context of the ToU tariff structure. \u2022 Configurations with PV solar and grid combination are found to be more reliable under all three techno-enviro-economic aspects in the respective DSM scenarios as it was found to be technically sound with lower emission rates and financial investment as well. \u2022 A quantitative reduction in Net present cost is observed in HES configurations after DSM implementation over before DSM configurations. \u2022 The study adopted MCDM-Fuzzy AHP, Fuzzy PROMETHEE, and Fuzzy TOPSIS approaches which extend additional support in ensuring the choice of optimal source configuration. With three criteria and sub-criteria, these fuzzy set MCDM methods outrank PV + Grid after DSM configuration uniformly. \u2022 Despite all conflicts in choices, contradicting sensitivity analysis shows that the uncertainty with Load variation and solar irradiation GHI doesn\u2019t have a considerable impact on future assessments. Succinctly, TID-SEM emphasizes that gathering comprehensive information on remote supply and generation sources in a smart environment makes it easier for customers to formulate sustainable building energy plans from the point of all three techno-enviro-economic factors. The integrated TID-SEM approach concludes the energy configuration of grid-tied HES with solar PV panels under considerable DSM strategy promotes overall building energy performance. TID-SEM optimizes energy usage for cost savings and environmental benefits. It enhances system flexibility, and resilience, and provides real-time decision support for energy management Thus, the framework is expected to render greater support in the conceptual deployment of the centralized ingenious supply\u2013demand controller for attaining clean and sustainable energy targets. Designed for scalability and interoperability, it even suits diverse smart systems and energy infrastructures. The TID-SEM paves the way to extract knowledge on building energy use and outline to develop a real-time supply and demand balancing unit for any industrial/ residential/ commercial building with appropriate feed-in and location detail across the world.

        "dc:description": "Sustainable Energy Plan is an indispensable field of study in the context of Building Energy Management (BEM) which yearns for a cutting-edge technique to raise consumers\u2019 level of contentment with energy usage. This paper introduces a three-tier strategic approach for demand cum supply side management at the prosumer end named TID-SEM (Three-tier Integrated Demand cum Supply Energy Management) framework. The framework commences with data collection, machine learning, and Random Forest classifier-based Demand side management to reduce peak demand. Followingly, a feasibility study on available sources (Solar PV + Battery + Diesel Generator + Grid) was done using the HOMER simulator. The quality techno-enviro-economic shows distinguished optimal one under each criterion. Ultimately to overcome, an ideal computative multicriteria decision-making approaches Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process, the Fuzzy Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluations, and the Fuzzy Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution employed to highlight the most optimal configuration. The study focuses on a department building within a higher education institution in the Madurai district, Tamil Nadu, India. On implementing the TID-SEM, \u2018PV + Grid\u2019 after DSM configuration was ranked as the most optimum. Lastly, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate the techno-enviro-economic impact of uncertain parameters on the optimal configuration, ensuring the robustness of the proposed framework.",
