Electrification of space heating combined with electricity generation through renewable resources has a significant potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, especially when coupled with advanced control strategies that utilize building energy flexibility. This study analyses data from approximately 7,800 houses in Ontario and Québec, Canada to investigate the most suitable data length, data interval and calibration horizon of building models for assessment of Model Predictive Control strategies on a large scale. Overall, models with calibration horizon of 24 h, data length of 7 days and time interval of 15 min provided the best balance between accuracy and computational resources. The calibrated models were used to compare a simple deadband controller to a Model Predictive Controller that minimizes the cost of electricity for a cold day in January. The results showed that the Model Predictive Controller can systematically reduce the high-price energy consumption, while improving thermal comfort, by successfully preheating before the high-price periods. Preheating shifts the peak power consumption, reducing it by 15 % for Ontario and 30 % for Québec. If just 1,000 houses adopt optimal strategies, the grid could see an average reduction in energy consumption of up to 15 MWh and 11 MWh during high-price periods in Ontario and Québec respectively.

Its importance is emphasized as renewable energy sources are substituting polluting fossil fuel power plants. The price of photovoltaic (PV) solar panels has decreased exponentially since 1980 and continues to drop; this is mainly due to manufacturing advances and governmental financial incentives [2]. As a result, PV panels have become a familiar feature of building design and are now often found in residential areas [3]. However, one of the barriers to the large-scale integration of PV is the challenge it presents to the electricity grid, due to a mid-day drop of electricity demand followed by a high evening peak, when the sun sets [4]. At the same time, the electrification of space and water heating, the widespread adoption of heat pumps, as well as the increasing adoption of electric vehicles are becoming progressively popular as means to reduce Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions [5]. Heating electrification in particular can reduce GHG emissions up to 30% and energy consumption up to 20% [6]. However, the electrification of space heating poses similar challenges to the grid as the adoption of PV technologies because it increases building electricity demand, especially in cold climates in the morning and evening when the occupancy is higher [7]. Advanced or \u201csmart\u201d controllers have been identified as a potential way to mitigate both problems by utilizing concepts that leverage energy flexibility, such as electrical [8] and thermal [9] storage of a building, or by interacting with the grid in a transactive way [10]. Building Energy Flexibility (BEF) is defined as \u201cthe ability to manage the demand and generation according to climate conditions, user needs, and energy network requirements\u201d [11]. The need to quantify the BEF in respect to a reference profile has led to the definition of the Building Energy Flexibility Index (BEFI), which quantifies the change in power demand over a certain period relative to a reference power demand profile [12]. The estimation of the BEFI requires a building energy model that can accurately predict the thermal response of the building. Building energy models are often categorized into white-box, black-box and grey-box. White-box models are based on the conservation of mass, energy and momentum, while black-box models are purely statistical correlations between inputs and outputs [13]. Grey-box models combine the two methods; they are simpler than white-box models, but still rely on physics. Instead of using basic assumptions to estimate their parameters, they are calibrated with measured data. There are multiple review articles comparing the different kinds of building models. A full review of the literature on building models is beyond the scope of this paper. Harish and Kumar [14] presented a detailed literature review of the three modelling approaches and highlighted the need for a method to systematically develop simplified building models and the need for full integration into advanced control systems. Drgoa et al. [15] conducted a literature review on the three modelling approaches and concluded that grey-box models are more likely to be suitable for Model Predictive Control (MPC), because they require less data, are less prone to overfitting, and have higher building-to-building generalizability. Wang and Chen [16] presented a literature review on data-driven models and concluded that Resistor\u2013Capacitor (RC) grey-box models are mode suitable for physical interpretation. Li et al. [17] also compared the three modelling approaches and identified RC models as the preferred choice for control and district applications. Increased building-to-building generalization can facilitate knowledge transfer in regards to both choosing the order and the structure of the model, and the bounds and initial estimation of the parameters [18]. 1.1 Large-scale model development using smart thermostat data With the adoption of Internet-of-Things and smart thermostats, big data sources are becoming increasingly available. Smart thermostats provide a valuable opportunity to develop building energy models on a large scale; these models can then be used to evaluate the aggregated impact of their control strategies on the grid. Although there are a lot of individual studies that use smart thermostat data to model a few houses, there are not many that focus on a larger number of houses. It should be noted that most of them utilize subsets of the same dataset. John et al. [19] used smart thermostat data to identify time constant values of more than 10,000 residential buildings in North America. They used an exponential decay method based on the solution of a simple 1R1C in a steady-state condition. They used only periods during the night (no solar gains), when the HVAC systems were off, and the outdoor temperature stayed relatively constant. They found that the time constants vary seasonally, being lower in the summer likely due to open windows. Baasch et al. [20] used smart thermostat dataset of 4646 houses in Ontario, Canada and New York, USA to compare different grey-box methods to derive building properties. They used 3 different methods to identify the time constant τ of a house: the energy signature, exponential decay, and an overall energy balance. They concluded that the first method showed the most unreliable results, and that the energy balance method systematically overpredicts the time constants τ compared to the exponential decay method. Hossain et al. [21] used smart thermostat data from 8884 in Canada to identify grey-box models with Bayesian neural networks. They use a Bayesian Neural Network (NN) based on a nRnC structure to model each house, and they show that the 2R2C model has the best performance. They also explored the idea of transfer learning across seasons for the same house and across different houses with similar characteristics and they showed that the models can achieve the same or better accuracy with much less data. Doma et al. [22] used smart thermostat data to investigate the thermal performance of 11,000 Canadian houses. They represented each house with a simple 1R1C model and used two methods to identify the model parameters: least-squares fitting of exponential decay curves and of the overall energy balance. The two methods resulted in time constant values with a median of 60 and 59 h respectively. The authors identified the building age as the most influential parameter on the time constant and the number of floors the least. Huchuk et al. [23] used smart thermostat data to develop and evaluate data-driven models for residential buildings. They used ReStock [24] to generate 500 representative single-family houses in the United States. They modified the houses to match the metadata of the available houses and used EnergyPlus to simulate one year of operation. They tested three different types of control for each house: a simple deadband control, MPC using a ridge regression with history of 20 min and a Reinforcement Learning (RL) model-free control. The MPC controller managed to reduce the costs compared to the deadband controller, while the RL controller showed poor performance. In a different study, Huchuk et al. [25] used smart thermostat data from 1000 houses in the United States to evaluate data-driven thermal models for multi-hour predictions. They compared simple 1R1C grey-box models and various black-box models, including Lasso and Ridge Regression, Random Forest and Autoregressive models with exogenous variables, to a baseline model that consisted of a constant temperature (the one of the last timestep). They concluded that the best estimator was the ridge regression model. Leprince et al. [26] proposed an automated method for stochastic single-zone model generation. The algorithm iteratively increases the complexity of the model until the increased complexity does not statistically increase the quality of the model. They applied the algorithm on smart thermostat data of 247 Dutch houses, out of which 93 were identified as good fits. They used the identified parameters from the resulting models to benchmark the building envelope insulation performance. Doma and Ouf [27] used smart thermostat data from 60,000 houses in North America to target buildings for retrofits. They calibrated a 1R1C model for each house using two methods: least-squares fitting of exponential decay curves and of the energy balance. The resulting models had time constant values with a median of 52 h. Then they clustered the model parameters and ranked each cluster to indicate the need for retrofit. 1.2 Contributions The present work uses smart thermostat data to model approximately 7500 houses located in Ontario and Québec, Canada. The vast majority of Québec houses use electric baseboards for space heating, creating an average winter morning peak power demand of 38,000 MW, mainly because of residential space heating, highlighting the need for peak shifting measures [28]. Using MPC to participate in Demand-Response (DR) events or to assess the energy flexibility of a house requires accurate predictions up to 24 h in advance. Taking the above points into account, the objectives of this work are to: \u2022 Rapidly and efficiently develop control-oriented models suitable for the large-scale application of optimal heating load management of residential buildings. The models need to have adequate accuracy for 24-h predictions. \u2022 Investigate the effect of training data length, calibration horizon, and data interval on model calibration and model accuracy. \u2022 Apply the developed models in an MPC one-day-ahead framework for each house, targeting the reduction of electricity costs for the homeowners based on current DR events and pricing structures. \u2022 Explore the potential aggregated effect for the population of homes. 2 Methods This section outlines the methods used in the study. More specifically, Section 2.1 provides a description of the available dataset, while the structure of the proposed building model along with its discretization is presented in Section 2.2. Detailed information about the different model calibrations for each house is provided in Section 2.3 and about the model evaluation in Section 2.4. Section 2.5 explains the pricing structures of the DR events and the MPC formulation applied on each house. 2.1 Data description Ecobee provides researchers with user-inputted metadata, which, among other information, include a unique identifier for each house, the country, province/state and city that the house is located in, the floor area and age of house, the number of occupants and floors, the style of the house, whether it has a heat pump or not and what the auxiliary fuel type is. For every house, the Ecobee thermostats collect 5-min interval measurements which contain the information about the indoor temperature, the cooling and heating setpoint, the outdoor temperature, relative humidity value and upper and lower setpoint and the runtime of the heating and cooling systems equipment in seconds. The 7800 houses considered in this study include houses heated with natural gas and electricity and some that are equipped with heat pumps. Considering that space heating electrification is becoming popular, in order to assess its potential effect on the grid, all houses are assumed to use electricity-powered systems with an equivalent installed capacity. A key feature missing from the dataset is solar radiation, which is often necessary for models to have accurate predictions since solar heat gains are a major disturbance to a building energy model [18]. The location of each thermostat (with the city, province/state and country entries as inputs) was used to find the latitude and longitude through pythons library geopy [29] using the Nominatim Application Programming Interface (API) [30]. As mentioned, this information is user-supplied and therefore is bound to have inaccuracies and mistakes, rendering some entries unusable. The historical solar radiation data were fetched from the National Solar Radiation Database of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory of the U.S. Department of Energy, using their API [31] and the latitude and longitude of each location. The solar radiation has units of W/m2 and is available in 5-min intervals for some years and locations and in 30-min intervals for some others. In the latter case the values were interpolated to 5 min. 2.2 Model description Each house is represented by a second-order thermal network, as shown in Fig. 1. The whole house is represented with one effective interior node and one effective envelope node. Eq. (1) shows the differential equations that correspond to the thermal network. (1) C i d T i d t = T a − T i R i a + T e − T i R i e + Q h + Q c + Q i , s o l C e d T e d t = T a − T e R e a + T i − T e R i e + Q e , s o l where t (s) denotes time, R ( ° C/W) thermal resistance, C (J/ ° C) thermal capacitance, T temperature ( ° C), Q (W) power inserted into the space, and subscript i the interior, a the ambient air, e the envelope, h heating, c cooling and sol solar gains. The indoor loads from the occupants as well as from potential equipment and appliances are assumed to be negligible. Discretizing Eq. (1) using a forward time finite difference scheme and rearranging it leads to Eq. (2): (2) T i t + 1 = 1 − Δ t R i e C i − Δ t R i a C i T i t + Δ t R i e C i T e t + Δ t R i a C i T a t + Q h , i n s t C i δ h t + Q c , i n s t C i δ c t + α i C i Q s o l Δ t T e t + 1 = 1 − Δ t R i e C e − Δ t R e a C e T e t + Δ t R i e C e T i t + Δ t R e a C e T a t + α e C e Q s o l Δ t where Δ t (s) is the timestep, Qh,inst (W) is the installed power of the heating system, Qc,inst (W) the installed power of the cooling system, α an effective solar factor that includes solar aperture, δ h (s) and δ c (s) the runtime of the heating and cooling systems accordingly and the superscript t denotes the t-th timestep. Eq. (2) can also be written in a matrix notation: (3) T t + 1 = AT t + Bu t where T = T i T e T , u = T a δ h δ c Q s o l T and A and B are given by Eqs. (4) and (5) respectively. (4) A = 1 − Δ t R i e C i − Δ t R i a C i Δ t R i e C i Δ t R i e C e 1 − Δ t R i e C e − Δ t R e a C e (5) B = Δ t R i a C i Q h , i n s t C i Q c , i n s t C i α i Δ t C i Δ t R e a C e 0 0 α e Δ t C e For the stability of the explicit finite difference scheme Eq. (6) must hold [32]. (6) Δ t < m i n 1 1 R i e C i + 1 R i a C i , 1 1 R i e C e + 1 R e a C e The parameters of Eq. (2) are calibrated with measured data for each house. However, since only the runtimes of the heating and cooling systems are available and there is no information about the installed power of the systems, it is impossible to identify all the parameters, but rather their combinations: R i e C i , R i a C i , Q h , i n s t / C i , Q c , i n s t / C i , α i / C i , R i e C e , R e a C e and α e / C e . 2.3 Data selection and model calibration Although the Ecobee dataset includes data for more than 100,000 houses in North America since 2015, this study targeted only houses located in Québec and Ontario (Canada). The total number of dwellings is 7831. Every house has different periods of missing data, so, for every house, the longest period of consecutive data between November and February (inclusive) was identified. The study aimed to test the effect of data length on the accuracy of the model. Therefore, data lengths of 3 days, 7 days and 14 days were used, resulting in 3 different models for each house and comparing their accuracy. All models also had a test set of 2 days not used in the calibration at all, in order to test the generalizability of the model. To calibrate the models, the data points can be treated either as (a) independent observations, resulting in an ordinary least-squares calibration, or (b) as sequential observations. In the latter case, the model uses its own predictions to predict multiple timesteps ahead during the calibration stage and the number of steps is called calibration horizon. It has been reported that models calibrated to predict as many steps ahead as the prediction horizon of the MPC yield better results [33]. This method is called MPC Relevant Identification (MRI) and in that case the calibration horizon equals to the prediction horizon. Calibrating models with the MRI method makes the calibration process non-linear, thus significantly increasing the computational resources required. A non-linear least squares solver from pythons library scipy [34] is used to calibrate the models. The models of this study were then used to predict the response of the building over the next 24 h. For the present dataset, where the time interval between two datapoints is 5 min, the model needs to look forward 288 steps. Such an approach can increase dramatically the computational time needed by the MRI calibration; because of this, this study explored the effect of temporal resolution on the final models. Three time intervals were used: 5-min (original sampling rate), 15-min and 60-min. These are the typical intervals used by most utilities when estimating the peak power and energy consumption of residential buildings [35]. To create the datasets for the 15-min and 60-min intervals the datasets were resampled using the summation for the HVAC runtimes, the average for the solar radiation and the instant values for the temperatures. Another reason to prefer larger time intervals is that low-order models do not have the ability to capture the small and fast thermal changes that happen in just 5 min [18], due to the low structural identifiability [36]. To summarize, 18 models were calibrated in total for each house: 3 models corresponding to each of the 5-min, 15-min and 60-min intervals, for each one of the 3 data lengths (3 days, 7 days and 14 days), using both the ordinary least squares and MRI calibration methods. 2.4 Model evaluation The models were evaluated using the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) criterion. RMSE is a commonly used metric used to measure the difference between measured and predicted values. As a secondary metric, a baseline model was used to help assess whether the calibrated models predict the indoor temperature well. The baseline model predicted a constant temperature over the prediction horizon equal to that of the initial condition. All metrics were estimated using the predictions of the models for 24 h in the future. Moreover, the models were also used on the test set to check their generalizability and avoid overfitting. In order to assess whether the resulting models and their parameters encompassed building physics the time constants of each house were evaluated. The time constants of each model can be found by estimating the poles of the transfer function of Eq. (3). For a real and positive pole p, the time constant τ is given by Eq. (7) [37]. (7) τ = − 1 l n ( p ) The transfer function for Eq. (3) has two poles, therefore there are two time constants. These two time constants characterize the main ways that heat flows from the indoors to the outdoors. The shorter time constant might be associated with the heat transfer between the indoor air and the thermal mass of the house, whereas the longer one can be associated to the heat transfer between the indoor and outdoor air [38]. 2.5 Model Predictive Control (MPC) The calibrated models were used to assess the aggregated impact of an MPC controller that optimally adjusts to the Time-of-Use (TOU) tariffs or DR events issued by the grid. The DR potential was assessed during January 20, 2020, which is a cold day in Ontario and Québec, with an average outdoor temperature in the studied locations fluctuating between −20 ° C and − 10 ° C and an average solar radiation reaching a maximum of 420 W/m2. The indoor air temperature setpoint was assumed to be at 21 ° C with a night setback of 19 ° C between 9 p.m. and 6 a.m. The weather conditions along with the temperature setpoint and the price of electricity during the day are shown in Fig. 2. The current TOU price of electricity in Ontario during the winter weekdays is 7.4 ¢/kWh from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m., 10.2 ¢/kWh from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. and 15.1 ¢/kWh from 7 a.m. to 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. to 7 p.m [39]. On the other hand, in Québec there is no TOU cost of electricity, but there is dynamic pricing for some of the residential users with certain peak demand events during the winter [40]. During these events, which can occur from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. and from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m., the electricity is billed at 51.967 ¢/kWh instead of the normal 7.65 ¢/kWh. The standard way to achieve thermal comfort is to keep the indoor temperature within a certain range, which during MPC can be implemented as a hard constraint or a soft constraint. Hard constraints cannot be violated, while soft constraints can, but are included in the cost function and therefore penalized. They are often multiplied by a large factor in the cost function to ensure that they are not violated often. Generally, soft constraints are preferable, because they are more practical and do not hinder optimization convergence. An in-depth discussion on thermal comfort constraints used in building control can be found in [15]. Both hard and soft constraint approaches have been used by many studies. For example, Huchuk et al. [23] and Seal et al. [41] included thermal comfort as a soft constraint, with the former penalizing it when the indoor temperature deviated from the (heating or cooling) setpoint by more than 2 ° C and the latter using a temperature setpoint range of 1 ° C when the house was occupied and 5.5 ° C when the house was unoccupied. On the other hand, Cole et al. [42] and Bianchini et al. [43] used a hard constraint, with the former having a setpoint range of 4 ° C when the house was occupied and 8 ° C when the house was unoccupied and the latter a range of 2 ° C (occupied) and 6 ° C (unoccupied). Because the installed power of the heating system in each house is not available, it is impossible to quantify the power demand, the energy consumption, and the cost in absolute terms. However, a relative calculation is possible: to quantify the difference of the reference case to the MPC case, these quantities are formulated per unit of installed heating power of the system Qh,inst . Therefore, Eq. (8) shows Qh , which is the heating power consumption formulated per kW installed (kW/kWinst), Eq. (9) shows qh , which is the heating energy consumption formulated per kW installed (kWh/kWinst), Eq. (10) shows c, which is the total cost for heating per kW installed (¢/kWinst) (8) Q h = Q h , i n s t δ h Δ t Q h , i n s t = δ h Δ t kW kW i n s t (9) q h = Q h , i n s t δ h Q h , i n s t = δ h 3600 kWh kW i n s t (10) c = q h p = δ h p 3600 ¢ kW i n s t Eq. (11a) shows the MPC controller formulation, which is trying to minimize the price of electricity, as seen in Fig. 2, over a prediction horizon PH. Eq. (11b) forces the formulation to use the building model of the house shown in Eq. (3). Eq. (11c) constrains the heating equipment runtime to be at most as large as the timestep itself. Thermal comfort was considered as a soft constraint, which does not allow the temperature to fall below the setpoint nor exceed the setpoint by more than 2 ° C. β is a factor that weights the cost of energy to the \u201ccost\u201d of discomfort. It needs to be large enough that thermal comfort violations do not happen often, and is chosen to be β = 100 ¢ ° C h kW i n s t . In comparison, the cost of electricity c ranges from 1.85 to 13 ¢ kW i n s t depending on the time of day. The prediction and control horizons of the MPC formulation were 24 h, and the initial temperature was assumed to be 20 ° C. The optimization problem is convex and was solved using the cvxpy library in python [44]. (11a) J = m i n ∑ j = 1 P H c j + ∑ j = 1 P H β d j (11b) s . t .

The average dynamic BEFI at time t and for duration Dt (per kW installed) was calculated with Eq. (12) [12], where Qref is the power consumption under a reference energy consumption profile, Qflex is the power consumption of the flexible strategy. The reference case was established by using a deadband controller with on/off cycling and a single-sided deadband of 0.5 ° C (1 ° F). This is similar to the strategy found both in the Ecobee dataset and in [23].

Most of the houses are located in Ontario; only 624 houses are located in Québec. Fig. 3 shows the distribution of the RMSE of the 7304 houses for the 3 different lengths of the training set and the 2 days of the test set. The first observation is that models with a calibration horizon of 24 h have a much lower RMSE on the training set than the ones with calibration horizon of 1 timestep, but that difference in accuracy seems to be small in the test set. Overall, models with calibration horizon of 24 h and higher training data lengths performed better on average. Models with calibration horizon of 1 timestep performed better when calibrated with smaller timesteps, while models with calibration horizon of 24 h had similar performance for different timesteps. Finally, models calibrated with data length of 3 days performed well on the dataset they had already \u201cseen\u201d during the calibration, but their accuracy was reduced significantly on the test set. 3.1 Evaluation and filtering of the models Naturally, not all 7304 models captured the thermal dynamics of the respective house adequately, but at the same time it is impossible to plot the response of every single one of them. Instead, an automated rule is necessary to filter out models that may not be accurate enough for the MPC formulation. The models were filtered based on how much better their predictions were compared to the baseline; more specifically, any model that did not achieve an RMSE decrease of at least 0.5 ° C for the training and any RMSE decrease for test set was discarded. Table 1 shows the number of models satisfying these criteria and Fig. 4 shows the updated distributions of RMSE based on the filtered models. Models with 24-h calibration horizon produced more models that perform significantly better than the baseline and they performed on average better than the models with 1-timestep calibration horizon. Although having 3 days for training and calibration horizon of 24 h produced the most models, they suffered from overfitting, indicated by their significantly larger RMSE on the test set. On the other hand, 7 and 14 days of training data performed slightly worse on the training set, sacrificing training accuracy for generalizability, having a much better performance on the test set. When it comes to the time interval of the data, models with 1-timestep calibration horizon performed better as the time interval decreased, but the ones with 24-h calibration horizon seemed to be less affected. Models with 24-h calibration horizon showed similar performance for 5-min and 15-min data intervals, but there was a small increase of RMSE for 60-min intervals in the test set. Although this increase was small, it could indicate that 60-min intervals are large enough to not allow the capture of some shorter building thermal dynamics. Fig. 5 shows the distribution of time constants τ 1 (in minutes) and τ 2 (in hours) of the filtered houses for different data lengths and time intervals and calibration horizons. Time constants of models with 24-h calibration horizon were very similar for different data intervals and were slightly larger than the ones with 1-timestep calibration horizon, which concentrated towards smaller values of τ 1. As data length increases the distributions become less spread for all cases. All distributions of models with 24-h calibration horizon have a median τ 1 of approximately 200 min, and τ 2 of 100 h. Overall all distributions seem to roughly follow expert knowledge [38]. The models with 15-min interval data and calibration horizon of 24 h were used to assess the DR potential using MPC, because they provided a good balance between accuracy, resolution and computational resources. The final dataset included 2229 houses, out of which 2091 were located in Ontario and 138 in Québec. The models had a mean RMSE of 0.5 ° C, median RMSE of 0.5 ° C and standard deviation of 0.24 ° C on the training set and mean RMSE of 0.74 ° C, median RMSE of 0.62 ° C and standard deviation of 0.44 ° C on the test set for 24-h predictions. 3.2 MPC application on the population of houses Fig. 6 shows the distributions of the results for the reference case and the MPC strategy that tries to reduce the cost of electricity based on the TOU rate in Ontario (top row) and the DR event in Québec (bottom row). Examining the results for the province of Ontario, at first glance the distribution of the total heating energy consumption of the MPC seems to be slightly higher than the reference, with the median consumption of the reference case being 7.40 kWh/kWinst and the one for the MPC case 7.54 kWh/kWinst. However, the MPC performed well during the high-price periods (7 a.m. to 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. to 7 p.m.). The MPC strategy reduced the peak power consumption from being always at the maximum (which is the total installed power) to a median of 0.4 kW/kWinst and the energy consumption from a median of 2.6 kWh/kWinst to a median of 0.77 kWh/kWinst. Because the optimization algorithm was trying to reduce the cost of electricity while maintaining thermal comfort, the strongest effect of the MPC strategy is reflected in the total cost of electricity and thermal discomfort for the occupant. The MPC strategy managed to reduce cost in all cases, with a median reduction of 12 ¢/kWinst, or 16%, while completely eliminating thermal discomfort. Because there are only 138 houses in Québec, the results are less likely to accurately reflect the average home than in the Ontario case. The patterns of the total heating energy consumption and the energy and peak power consumption during high-price periods are very similar to the Ontario ones. However, MPC managed to achieve much greater cost savings of an average 43 ¢/kWinst, or 31%. Assuming a typical residential building with 10 kW of installed power, the median homeowner could achieve a reduction of $1.07 in Ontario and $4.07 in Québec in one day. Similarly, each house could reduce the energy consumption during high-price periods by 15 kWh in Ontario and 11 kWh in Québec. From the grids perspective, during the high-price periods, Ontario and Québec could see a reduction in energy consumption of 15 MWh and 11 MWh per 1000 houses that adopt optimal strategies respectively. The difference in the magnitude of the results between Ontario and Québec can be explained by the very large difference between the off- and on-peak cost of electricity in Québec, and is attributed to the different strategies the provinces have adopted to reduce power demand. In Ontario, the TOU rate is in effect every day giving modest savings to homeowners who lower their peak consumption daily, whereas in Québec the DR events can only happen up to 33 times in one year. Fig. 7 shows the distribution of BEFI for a duration of 3 h during the whole day. For both Ontario and Québec, the BEFI was on average negative in the morning hours because the house was trying to preheat in anticipation of the morning peak when the setpoint increased from 19 ° C to 21 ° C. In both cases the BEFI increased a lot during the high-price periods; on average a house in Ontario achieved a BEFI of 0.37 kW/kWinst and in Québec 0.39 kW/kWinst from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. In the case of Ontario, the same effect \u2013 but of a smaller magnitude \u2013 was observed during the evening peak, when the average BEFI increased from −0.02 kW/kWinst during 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. to 0.06 kW/kWinst during 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. Fig. 8 shows the power consumption throughout the day for each house for the reference case and the MPC case. The average power consumption of all the houses is shown in blue. The comparison between the reference case and MPC highlights the preheating that happened before the high-price periods, especially in the morning. The MPC potential of a house and its cost reduction are defined by its ability to preheat and maintain comfortable temperatures for as long as possible. That means that houses with larger time constants (as shown in Fig. 5) have a higher MPC potential. The time constant of a house is affected by its thermal mass, i.e., its construction materials, as well as its overall building envelope insulation properties, which mainly include building envelope elements, thermal bridges, ventilation, and infiltration. In consequence, buildings with better thermal insulation properties have overall a higher potential for energy flexibility and demand response applications. In general, the larger the time constants of the house, the earlier the house can preheat, and the earlier it can harvest its energy flexibility potential. The different times that the houses started to preheat resulted into the relatively large interquartile range of the BEFI during night hours in Fig. 7. The new average heating profile shown in Fig. 8 had a slightly smaller peak, around 85% of the reference one in Ontario and 70% in Québec (or a power peak reduction of 0.15 kW/kWinst in Ontario and 0.3 kW/kWinst in Québec), due to the different preheating start times. However, there was still a peak that essentially just shifted to the hours exactly before the original one. If enough customers implement optimal controls, then that shifting effect could potentially prove to be a challenge for the grid, highlighting the need for dynamic pricing and smart and transactive grids [45]. 4 Conclusion As smart thermostats become increasingly available in residential buildings, there is an opportunity to study the effect of data resolution, length, and calibration on control-oriented building models and the effect of advanced control strategies. To do that, this study used smart thermostat data from 7800 houses in Ontario and Québec, Canada. Each house was modelled with a second-order model and calibrated with different data intervals, training data lengths and calibration horizons. Models calibrated with calibration horizon of 24 h performed significantly better than models with calibration horizon of 1 timestep. Data length of 3 days led to model overfitting, whereas data with 60-min time intervals led to a small loss of information. Overall the models with calibration horizon of 24 h, data length of 7 days and time interval of 15 min provided the best balance between accuracy and computational resources. These models were then used to perform MPC on a cold day of January using the TOU rates of Ontario and the dynamic pricing of Québec. The MPC performance was compared to the performance of a reference deadband controller with a single-sided deadband. The analysis showed that the MPC controller can systematically reduce the high-price energy consumption, reducing the cost for homeowners by 16% in Ontario and 31% in Québec, while at the same time eliminating thermal discomfort usually introduced by setpoint setback. MPC achieves that by preheating the houses, successfully harvesting the energy flexibility of the houses. The preheating shifts power peak consumption, reducing it by 0.15 kW/kWinst in Ontario and 0.3 kW/kWinst in Québec.

        "dc:description": "Electrification of space heating combined with electricity generation through renewable resources has a significant potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, especially when coupled with advanced control strategies that utilize building energy flexibility. This study analyses data from approximately 7,800 houses in Ontario and Québec, Canada to investigate the most suitable data length, data interval and calibration horizon of building models for assessment of Model Predictive Control strategies on a large scale. Overall, models with calibration horizon of 24 h, data length of 7 days and time interval of 15 min provided the best balance between accuracy and computational resources. The calibrated models were used to compare a simple deadband controller to a Model Predictive Controller that minimizes the cost of electricity for a cold day in January. The results showed that the Model Predictive Controller can systematically reduce the high-price energy consumption, while improving thermal comfort, by successfully preheating before the high-price periods. Preheating shifts the peak power consumption, reducing it by 15 % for Ontario and 30 % for Québec. If just 1,000 houses adopt optimal strategies, the grid could see an average reduction in energy consumption of up to 15 MWh and 11 MWh during high-price periods in Ontario and Québec respectively.",
