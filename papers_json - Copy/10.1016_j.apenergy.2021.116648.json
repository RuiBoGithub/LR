The adoption of model predictive control (MPC) for building automation and control applications is challenged by the high hardware and software requirements to solve its optimization problem. This study proposes an approximate MPC that mimics the dynamic behaviours of MPC using the recurrent neural network with a structure of nonlinear autoregressive network with exogenous inputs. The approximate MPC is developed by learning from the measured operation data of buildings controlled by MPC, therefore it can produce MPC-like control for buildings without needing to solve the optimization problem, significantly reducing the computation load as compared to MPC. The proposed approximate MPC is implemented in two testbeds, an office and a lecture theatre, to control the air-conditioning systems. The control performance of the approximate MPC is compared to MPC as well as the original reactive control of the two testbeds. The approximate MPC retained most of the energy and thermal comfort performance of MPC in both testbeds. For the office, the MPC and approximate MPC reduced 58.5% and 51.6% of cooling energy consumption, respectively, as compared to the original control. For the lecture theatre, the MPC and approximate MPC reduced 36.7% and 36.2% of cooling energy consumption, respectively, as compared to the original control. Meanwhile, both approximate MPC and MPC significantly improved indoor thermal comfort in the two testbeds as compared to their original control. Despite having minor degradation in control performance the approximate MPC was more than 100 times faster than MPC in generating optimal control commands in each time step.

In tropical countries, air-conditioning and mechanical ventilation (ACMV) systems also account for most, up to 70%, of the energy consumption in buildings [3]. Using advanced control strategies for HAVC/ACMV management can significantly improve building energy efficiency as suggested by many studies [45] and one of the most promising control techniques is model predictive control (MPC) [6]. MPC could make use of a model of the controlled building and takes weather conditions (e.g., air temperature, humidity, and solar radiation), internal heat loads (e.g., heat loads from occupancy, equipment and lighting) and constraints (e.g., comfortable ranges of indoor conditions and cooling capacity of HVAC/ACMV systems) into consideration for forward prediction and optimization of building operation [7]. MPC has been demonstrated capable of achieving substantial energy savings and significantly improved human comfort for buildings, as compared to conventional reactive control (e.g., proportional\u2013integral\u2013derivative (PID)), in numerous previous studies [8]. However, several technical challenges are still limiting MPC from wider adoption for building automation and control (BAC) [9]. One key challenge is that the optimization problem of MPC is computationally expensive to solve [10], making it prohibitive to implement MPC through typical industrial controllers, such as programmable logic controller (PLC) or direct digital controller (DDC), for real-time building control and optimization applications [11]. Much effort has been made to reduce the computation load of MPC, especially on the development of simplified, usually linear, building models [1213] for computational efficiency. Bianchini et al. [14] developed a linear building thermal model based on AutoRegressive network with eXogenous inputs (ARX) and trained the model using the simulation data of a detailed building model. The linear building model was used to develop a MPC for controlling heating systems. Hazyuk et al. [15] developed a low-order building thermal model by thermal resistance\u2013capacitance (RC) network with parameters identified using the simulation data of a detailed building model. The low-order building thermal model was used to construct a MPC controller for a heating system to optimize indoor thermal comfort and heating energy consumption [16]. Picard et al. [17] converted a high-order building model into reduced-order models using the balanced truncation method for constructing MPC for a heating system. Their simulations show that MPC using reduced-order models requires much less computational effort compared to using a high-order building model. Yang et al. [18] developed a linear state-space building model for MPC, which was implemented in an office [19] and a lecture theatre [20] for real-time building optimization and control. However, the simplified building models still need to retain a certain complexity (e.g., one state to represent one room) to capture the dynamics of every room. Therefore, despite the adoption of the simplified building modelling approach, MPC is still computationally expensive for large buildings with many rooms. Another major hurdle for MPC adoption is that MPC requires sophisticated optimization tools/libraries to solve the optimization problem [11]. These tools/libraries are usually programmed in high-level languages (e.g., Python or MATLAB) and are not supported by most current BAC hardware and software [21]. One possible solution to overcome these two challenges is to approximate the control laws of MPC by learning from the operation data of a building when it is controlled by MPC using machine learning (ML) techniques such as artificial neural network (ANN). The approximate MPC control laws (or \u2018Approximate MPC\u2019) is essentially a data-driven model approximating the correlations between the input and output variables of MPC. Thus, approximate MPC using ML learning methods (e.g., ANN) could be explicitly written in mathematical expressions that could be easily implemented in industrial low-power control hardware (e.g., PLC or DDC) and low-level programming languages (e.g., structured text). Some previous studies applied ML or statistical models on the operation data to identify decision rules from MPC controllers to develop approximate MPC controllers, which were subsequently used to replace the original MPC controllers for building control. May-Ostendorp et al. [2223] used various data mining techniques including generalized linear model (GLM), classification and regression trees (CART) and adaptive boosting to identify decision rules from the simulated operation data of a MPC-controlled window. They applied the similar technique to identified decision rules of a MPC-controlled water pump in a cooling system [24]. Domahidi et al. [25] used the adaptive boosting method to identify decision rules from the simulated operation data of a MPC-controlled HVAC system. Le et al. [26] used the support vector machine (SVM) method to identify decision rules from simulated operation data of a MPC-controlled window blind. The identified control rules were programmed into simplified controllers to replace the original MPC controllers in these studies. Despite having demonstrated the feasibility of approximate MPC, these previous attempts make use of decision rules that only generate control commands in a discrete decision space (e.g., choosing between on/off, open/closed or from a discrete set of values), missing the essential continuous control behavior (choosing from a continuous decision space) of MPC [27] for controlling modulating actuators (e.g., water valves, water pumps and fans) of HVAC/ACMV systems. A few simulation studies investigated the direct approximation of the continuous control laws of MPC using ML or statistical modelling for BAC applications. Klauco et al. [28] developed an approximate MPC controller by employing regression trees (RT) for controlling an HVAC system. Žáčeková et al. [29] developed an approximate MPC using nonlinear regression for controlling an HVAC system. Robillart et al. [30] developed an approximate MPC controller using beta regression for controlling a heating system to shift the heating load. Drgoňa et al. [31] developed a few approximate MPC controllers by using the time-delay neural networks (TDNN) and RT for controlling an HVAC system. These studies have demonstrated the feasibility of approximate MPC to mimic the continuous control behavior of MPC. However, the main research gap of these previous studies is that they only focused on using feed-forward ML/statistical models to develop approximate MPC. Thus, approximate MPC employing feedback model, which is superior to feed-forward ML/statistical models in capturing dynamic behaviors [32], is rarely studied for BAC applications. Experimental evidence to support the feasibility and performance of approximate MPC is also lacking in the literature. To fill these research gaps, this study proposes an approximate MPC system that approximates the continuous control laws of a MPC for optimizing building energy efficiency and thermal comfort. The proposed approximate MPC features a dynamic feedback ML model, a recurrent neural network (RNN) with a Nonlinear AutoRegressive network with eXogenous inputs (NARX) structure, which forms the main novelty of this study. The control performance of the proposed approximate MPC system was investigated experimentally. Two approximate MPC controllers were developed and experimentally implemented for real-time control of the ACMV systems in an office testbed and a lecture theatre (LT) testbed. The building operation data used to train the approximate MPC controllers were obtained from measurements made in the two testbeds when they were controlled by the MPC controllers developed in a previous study [33]. The control performance of the approximate MPC, in terms of energy efficiency and indoor thermal comfort, was evaluated and compared to the original MPC. 2 Methodology 2.1 Overview Fig. 1 shows an overview of the methodology used in this study. It starts with having a MPC controller (consisting of a building model and optimization algorithm) to control the testbed building for a period of time. Building operation data collected during this period are to be used as the input/output data for training the approximate MPC controller. The input data are the input variables of the MPC controller, including the measured disturbances (e.g., weather and internal heat loads) and room conditions (e.g., PMV, air temperature, globe temperature and humidity). The output data include the cooling power set point of the ACMV system, which is the control command generated by the MPC controller. The approximate MPC controller is based on the NARX RNN, a dynamic feedback ML model that approximates the dynamic correlations between the input variables and the control command of the MPC controller. Thus, the approximate MPC controller can perform MPC-like control of a building with reference to the measured disturbances, room conditions and the control command at the last time step, without needing to solve the optimization problem. The approximate MPC controllers are then implemented in the testbed building to take over the control from the original MPC controllers. Control performance of the approximate MPC controllers in the testbed building is experimentally evaluated and compared against the original MPC controllers. 2.2 Testbeds Experiments were conducted in two testbeds including (1) an office at level 3 of the Research Techno Plaza building representing typical commercial built environments with moderate occupancy load and (2) a lecture theatre (LT) on the campus of Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore representing high-heat-load built environments with heavy, high-dynamic occupancy. 2.2.1 Office testbed Fig. 2 shows the internal layout and setup of the office testbed (or \u2018the office\u2019). The office is surrounded by adjacent air-conditioned spaces including other offices, a corridor and an atrium, thus, the weather does not affect the internal thermal conditions of the office through the facades. The floor area of the office is 46 m2 and the floor-to-ceiling height is 3 m. The major internal heat gains of the office are from the occupants, computers and light-emitting diode (LED) lighting fixtures. Conditioned air from a fan coil unit (FCU), which also serves a few adjacent spaces, is supplied into the office through a variable air volume (VAV) box, which has a maximum airflow capacity of 1,320 m3/h. The VAV box supplies the conditioned air through three 4-way diffusers as shown in Fig. 2. The VAV box is originally controlled by a thermostat, which regulates the supply air flowrate through an air damper according to a room air temperature set point of 23 °C. The ACMV system of the office operates during 8 am \u2013 6 pm of workdays and is switched off for the rest of the time. For the implementation of MPC and approximate MPC, the office is installed with additional sensors including a combined temperature-RH (relative humidity) sensor and a thermal comfort measurement device, which measures air velocity, temperature, RH and globe temperature for evaluation of predicted mean vote (PMV) index [34]. Occupant\u2019s metabolic rate and clothing level are assumed to be constant at 1.2 met and 0.57 clo in PMV calculation, according to the typical activity level and clothing of the occupants in the office. Another combined temperature-RH sensor and an airflow sensor are installed in the supply air duct leading to the VAV box to measure the conditions of the supply air. Sensible cooling power supplied to the office through the VAV box at any given point of time is calculated based on the measured difference in supply air and room air temperatures as well as the measured supply air flowrate. More details of the office, its ACMV system and instrumentation are described by Yang et al. [33]. 2.2.2 Lecture theatre testbed The LT testbed (or \u2018LT\u2019) has a seating capacity of 240 and a floor area of 255 m2. The major internal loads are the heat gains from the occupants and internal lighting. The whole room space is considered as one thermal zone, which is air-conditioned by an air-handling unit (AHU) that consists of a cooling coil and a variable speed drive (VSD) fan as shown in Fig. 3 . The airflow volume capacity of the AHU is 14,882 m3/h. Chilled water is supplied from a central chiller plant that serves the cluster of buildings where LT is located. The original building management system (BMS) of LT regulates the fan speed according to the room air temperature set point of 24 °C and the opening of the chilled water valve (WV) according to a varying supply air temperature set point, as described in Yang et al. [20]. When the control is switched to MPC, the AHU fan speed is regulated according to a supply air temperature set point of 15 °C and the chilled water valve is regulated to chase the cooling power set points generated by the MPC controller. The approximate MPC controller shares the similar control approach as the MPC controller with the exception that the cooling power set point is generated by the approximate MPC algorithm instead of the MPC algorithm. For the implementation of MPC and approximate MPC, additional sensors are installed in LT, as shown in Fig. 3, for measuring indoor and outdoor conditions as well as ACMV variables. The indoor thermal comfort is measured by the PMV index which is determined from the measured globe temperature, air temperature, air velocity and RH by sensors mounted at the seat near the middle of LT. Occupant\u2019s metabolic rate and clothing level are assumed to be constant at 1.2 met and 0.5 clo, respectively, according to the activity levels and clothing of the occupants in LT. Cooling power provided to LT at any point of time is measured by a thermal energy meter installed across the AHU cooling coil, measuring the chilled water mass flowrate, chilled water supply and return temperatures. The fan power is measured by an electric power meter. The occupancy level in LT is estimated based on the steady-state CO2 balance [35] in LT using the measured CO2 concentrations in supply air and return air. More details of LT, ACMV system and instrumentation are described by Yang et al. [2033]. 2.3 MPC**a MPC controllers developed in a previous study [33] are employed as the state-of-art \u2018teacher\u2019 for the approximate MPC controllers developed in this study. Instead of chasing a set point air temperature as the original thermostat control does in the office or the original BMS does in LT, the objectives of the MPC are, instead, to minimize cooling energy consumption and deviation of indoor PMV from thermal neutrality (PMV = 0), as shown by the cost function described by Eq. (1). (1) J = M i n i m i z e ( ∑ k = 1 N Q ^ c , t + k | t 2 + ∑ k = 1 N [ W PMV ( PMV ^ t + k | t ) ] 2 + W ε ε t + k | t ) where symbols J, Q ^ , PMV ^ , W, N, and ε refer to objective, normalized cooling power, normalized PMV, weighting factor, prediction horizon, and slack variable. Subscript k, t, c and PMV refer to index variable, time, cooling and PMV. Normalized cooling power is the ratio of instantaneous cooling power to the cooling capacity of the ACMV system. Normalized PMV is the ratio of the instantaneous PMV to the magnitude of the comfortable PMV range (-0.5 ≤ PMV ≤ 0.5) [36]. Particularly, the three terms on the right-hand side of Eq. (1) refer to costs of cooling energy consumption, thermal discomfort and violation of constraints within the prediction horizon, respectively. WPMV is the weighting factor for indoor PMV to allow for tuning the relative weighting between thermal comfort (second term) and cooling energy consumption (first term) in the cost function. In this study, WPMV is set at 4, whereas the weighting factor for the cooling energy consumption is 1. This setting prioritizes indoor PMV close to thermal neutrality (PMV = 0) over minimizing the cooling energy. W ε is the weighting factor for the cost of constraint violations (third term) and its value is set at 10000. With this setting, any violation of constraints would make this term much larger than the first two terms, i.e., very small tolerance to constraint violation [33]. The optimization problem described by Eq. (1) is constrained by the comfortable range of indoor PMV (−0.5 ≤ PMV ≤ 0.5) [36] and the cooling capacity of the ACMV systems. The control interval of the MPC is 5 min and the prediction horizon is 12-control-interval long. The prediction horizon is selected based on the response time of indoor thermal conditions in the two testbeds. During the morning start-up of ACMV in both testbeds, it takes maximum 40 min for the indoor PMV to reach and stablise at the best thermal comfort [33], suggesting that 40 min would be enough to cover the response time of the indoor thermal conditions for the two testbeds. The selected prediction horizon of 12 control intervals (60 min) is long enough to cover the response time for optimizing building future response. Setting a too much longer prediction horizon will unnecessarily increase the computation load in solving the optimization problem of MPC [37]. The output variable (manipulated variable) from the MPC is the optimal cooling power set point for the ACMV systems, i.e., the VAV box in the office or the AHU in LT. The input variables of the MPC include measured disturbances, feedback of measured states as well as feedback of the measured manipulated variable. More details of the MPC could be found in the previous study [33]. A MPC system was developed and implemented in both testbeds previously [33]. To obtain training data (input/output) for later development of approximate MPC, the MPC system controlled the VAV box in the office for 20 workdays (February 2019 \u2013 March 2019) and controlled the AHU for 10 days with classes (9th \u2013 15th September 2019 and 23rd \u2013 29th September 2019). Building operation data were recorded at 5-minute intervals. Further details of the MPC system and the experimental implementation in the two testbeds can be found in Yang et al. [33]. 2.4 Approximate MPC system The proposed approximate MPC system consists of an approximate MPC controller and a local controller as illustrated in Fig. 4 . With the same measured input variables of MPC as described in Section 2.3 including measured disturbances (e.g., weather conditions and internal heat loads), feedbacks of measured states (e.g., PMV, air temperature, globe temperature, humidity), as well as the feedback of measured manipulated variable (cooling power set point), the approximate MPC controller generates a near-optimal cooling power set point for the next time step and sends to the local controller. The local controller, which is the same as the one in the MPC system [33], chases the cooling power set point received by regulating the actuators of the ACMV systems (air damper in VAV box or chilled water valve WV in AHU) based on the PID scheme. By \u2018learning\u2019 from the MPC as described in Section 2.3, the approximate MPC follows the objectives of the MPC implicitly, which are to minimize cooling energy consumption and minimize the deviation of indoor PMV from thermal neutrality. The approximate MPC is essentially a ML model that can predict MPC-like control commands (cooling power set point for ACMV) based on the same input variables of MPC. In this study, the RNN with NARX structure, as expressed by Eq. (2), is employed to approximate the dynamic behaviors of MPC for developing a ML model to work as the approximate MPC. The NARX RNN is a dynamic network that is suitable for time-series predictions [3839] and, thus, suitable for approximating dynamic behaviors. The sigmoidal activation function, commonly used for ANN [40], was employed in this study. (2) y t = f ( y t - 1 , y t - 2 , ⋯ y t - n y , u t - 1 , u t - 2 , ⋯ u t - n u ) where symbols f(), y, u, t and n refer to function, output, input, time and number. The NARX RNN was trained using the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm in MATLAB deep learning toolbox [41] and the building operation data measured during MPC control, as described in Section 2.3. One hidden layer is selected for the NARX RNN, which can provide sufficient performance for most modelling problems [42] and avoid the possibility of overfitting due to having too many hidden layers [43]. The number of neurons in the hidden layer was determined by a \u2018trial-and-error\u2019 method [44]. Multiple trials of RNN training are performed starting from a small hidden layer size (number of neurons) to a point that training errors cannot be reduced further by enlarging the hidden layer size. This final hidden layer size is used for the NARX RNN, which becomes the approximate MPC controller. The same configuration of NARX RNN (except for the hidden layer sizes and the input variables) is used for both the office and LT testbeds to approximate the control laws of their respective MPC controllers. The hidden layer size of NARX RNN for each testbed is determined based on the above-described \u2018trial-and-error\u2019 method. The input variables of the MPC controllers of the two testbeds are different due to the difference in the internal setup (e.g., the number of occupants in LT is much more dynamic than the office) and structure (e.g., LT is exposed to the outdoor environment while the office is not) of the two testbeds. Details of the input/output variables of the NARX RNNs for the two testbeds are given below in Section 2.4.1 and 2.4.2. 2.4.1 Approximate MPC controller for the office The approximate MPC controller (NARX RNN model) for the office, trained with the measured operation data obtained when the office was controlled by MPC, is illustrated in Fig. 5 . The input data include hour of day (hod) obtained from the CPU timer of the control server, operation status (os) of the ACMV system obtained from the ACMV schedule, measured room air RH (RHz ) and measured room air temperature (Tz ), as listed in Table 1 . Some disturbances are unmeasured as they could be represented by other measured disturbances or have relatively small effects on room conditions as compared to other measured disturbances, reducing instrumentation requirement and computational complexity of MPC. The disturbances of internal loads are unmeasured and are represented by the measured disturbance os (ACMV is on when os is 1 and ACMV is off when os is 0) by assuming that the temporal variation of internal loads during a day follows the ACMV operation schedule (internal loads are at 0% when ACMV is off, internal loads are at 100% when ACMV is on). The thermal conditions (room air temperature and humidity) in the adjacent spaces are treated as unmeasured disturbances as the adjacent spaces are also air-conditioned. Hence, the difference of the thermal conditions between the adjacent spaces and the office is expected to be small. Heat transfer between the office and the outdoors through the building envelope was not considered as the office is not directly exposed to the outdoor environment. The output data are the cooling power set point (Qc ) generated by the MPC for the VAV box. The sensible cooling power of the VAV box in the office is defined as, (3) Q c , V A V = m ̇ sa C sa T z - T sa , where m ̇ , C, Q and T refer to mass flow rate (kg/s), specific heat capacity (J/(K kg)), heat flow rate (W) and temperature (K), respectively. Subscripts c, sa, VAV, and z refer to cooling, supply air, VAV box and thermal zone, respectively. The supply air mass flow rate, thermal zone air temperature (representing return air temperature) and supply air temperature were measured using the instrumentation described in Section 2.2.1. The input/output data set collected, as described in Section 2.3, was divided into three subsets randomly picked across the data collection period, 70% for model training, 15% for model validation and the remaining 15% for testing. 20 neurons of the hidden layer are selected for the approximate MPC controller based on the above-mentioned \u2018trial-and-error\u2019 method. The R-values of training, validation and testing phases are 0.993, 0.991 and 0.992, respectively, which indicate that the trained approximated MPC controller has high prediction accuracy in mimicking the behaviors of the MPC controller for predicting cooling power set point. The R-values of the validation and testing phases are very similar to that of the training phase, suggesting no obvious overfitting to the training data. 2.4.2 Approximate MPC controller for LT Fig. 6 shows the schematic diagram of the approximate MPC controller for LT. The input data include ACMV operation status (os), measured outdoor air temperature (To ), measured outdoor air RH (RHo ), estimated number of occupants (nocc ), measured room air temperature (Tz ), measured room air RH (RHz ) and measured room globe temperature (Tg ) as listed in Table 2 . Besides the number of occupants, which is highly dynamic in LT and is estimated based on measured CO2 concentrations in supply air and return air as described in Section 2.2.2, the other internal heat load due to lighting power is treated as unmeasured disturbance and represented by os with the same consideration for that of the office as described in Section 2.2.1. The thermal conditions in adjacent spaces are also considered as unmeasured disturbances with the same consideration for that of the office. The heat load from outdoor solar radiation is not considered as LT is located within shading [20]. The output data is the cooling power set point (Qc ) generated by the MPC controller for the AHU. The cooling power of the AHU in the office is defined as, (4) Q c , A H U = m ̇ cw C cw ( T cwr - T cws ) where subscripts AHU, cw, cws and cwr refer to AHU, chilled water, chilled water supply and chilled water return. The input/output data set collected, as described in Section 2.3, in LT was also divided into three subsets in the same way as that did for the office. 20 neurons of the hidden layer were selected for the approximate MPC controller based on the above-mentioned \u2018trial-and-error\u2019 method. The R-values of training, validation and testing phases are 0.998, 0.997 and 0.998, respectively. The consistency of R-values of the three phases is, again, suggesting no obvious overfitting to the training data. 2.5 Experimental arrangements In each testbed, the approximate MPC controller was implemented to perform real-time control of the ACMV system (the VAV box in the office, the AHU in LT). The approximate MPC controller was programmed and executed in the same control server that the MPC controller was. The control performance of the approximate MPC controller is compared to the MPC controller and the original reactive base control (Thermostat in the office, BMS in LT). The results of the MPC controller and the original control are obtained from the previous study [33] for this comparison. Time periods of the test cases are summarised in Table 3 . In the test periods, the office was operating during 8:00 am \u2013 6:00 pm of workdays and LT was operating according to the class schedule listed in Table 4 . 3 Results To evaluate the control performance of the approximate MPC, the test results of the Approximate MPC case is compared to the MPC and Thermostat/BMS cases using the measured data from the two testbeds. The test results were measured at 5-minute intervals from the two testbeds. The statistical distributions of indoor PMV are plotted and analyzed to evaluate the thermal comfort performance of the three cases for each testbed. The energy performance of the three cases in the office testbed is compared using the measured cooling power of the VAV box. The energy performance of the three cases in LT is compared using the measured energy consumption (cooling energy + supply fan electricity) of the AHU. 3.1 Test results in the office Fig. 7 shows the time series of measured indoor PMV and room air temperature of the three cases during office hours of the test period (20 days per case). The results include the median value and interquartile range of these time-series to show control characteristics and the fluctuation of indoor conditions of different controllers. The room air temperature is measured by the combined temperature-RH sensor and the indoor PMV is measured by the thermal comfort measurement device with globe temperature, air velocity and combined temperature-RH sensors, as shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 7 (a) & (d) show that the original thermostat overcooled the office during the morning start-up period (8 am \u2013 9:30 am). This can be attributed to the reactive nature of the thermostat\u2019s control logic control that overshot the room air temperature set point (23 °C) as it was trying to cool down the room during morning start-up. The morning overshoot issue was eliminated with the MPC, with its prediction and optimization capabilities, which cooled the room air temperature to near thermal neutrality and stayed around there for the rest of the day, as shown in Fig. 7 (b) & (e). Instead of chasing a set point reactively as the thermostat did, MPC proactively predicted the future indoor PMV using the built-in building model and sequentially optimized indoor thermal comfort (minimizing the deviation of indoor PMV from thermal neutrality) and ACMV energy efficiency (minimizing cooling energy consumption) based on its objective function (Eq. (1)). Hence, the MPC maintained indoor PMV on the positive side but close to the thermal neutrality at most office hours as shown in Fig. 7 (b), to avoid overcooling and maintain best thermal comfort. By mimicking the control laws of the MPC, the approximate MPC also prevented the morning overshoot as shown in Fig. 7 (c) & (f). Both the MPC and the approximate MPC kept indoor PMV and room air temperature within much narrower ranges from thermal neutrality as compared to that of the thermostat did. It suggests that the MPC and the approximate MPC maintained much more stable indoor thermal conditions than the thermostat did. Fig. 8 summarises the measured indoor PMV and room air temperature during office hours using box-and-whisker plots. These plots show the statistical distributions of the measured data (maximum, 75th percentile, median, mean, 25th percentile, and minimum) obtained from 20 days of measurements per case in the office. The same configuration of the box and whisker plot is applied to Figs. 9\u201311 . Fig. 8 (a) shows that all the three controllers were able to maintain indoor PMV within the comfortable range (-0.5 ≤ PMV ≤ 0.5) for all the office hours. This could be due to the fact that the office was surrounded by adjacent air conditioning spaces and, thus, away from direct impact of weather disturbances. Despite so the MPC and the approximate MPC still provide thermal comfort advantage over the reactive thermostat by maintaining the indoor PMV much closer to thermal neutrality. MPC maintained the most stable indoor thermal comfort condition, as indicated by the narrowest interquartile range of PMV, followed by approximate MPC and then thermostat, echoing the observations from Fig. 7. The MPC and the approximate MPC also maintained indoor PMV on the positive side for most time of the office hours, suggesting that the optimization for cooling power saving caused the MPC to incline towards positive PMV. This control characteristic was mimicked by the approximate MPC. In contrast, without any consciousness to save cooling power, the thermostat maintained indoor PMV on the negative side for most time of the office hours. The set-point-chasing nature of the thermostat can be seen more clearly in Fig. 8 (b). It shows that both the mean and median room air temperature in the Thermostat case is 23.4 °C, very close to the room air temperature set point of 23 °C in the thermostat. Mean and median room air temperature in the MPC case is a higher 24.1 °C, which is the outcome of chasing the objectives (minimize cooling energy consumption and minimize the deviation between indoor PMV and thermal neutrality) defined in Eq. (1). Mean and median room air temperature in the Approximate MPC case are 24.2 °C and 24.1 °C, respectively, very close to that of the MPC. The measured indoor PMV and room air temperature shown in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8 suggests that the approximate MPC reproduced the control characteristics of MPC, in terms of controlling room thermal conditions, fairly closely. Fig. 9 summarises the statistical distributions of measured cooling power supplied by the VAV box to the office during office hours using box-and-whisker plots. The cooling power is evaluated with the measured temperature and flowrate of supply air as well as room air temperature, as described in Section 2.2.1. The mean cooling power of the Thermostat case was the highest among the three cases at 1.88 kWh. The MPC case shows a substantial reduction in mean cooling power at 0.78 kWh, a 58.9% reduction compared to the Thermostat case. By mimicking the control laws of MPC, the approximate MPC retained most of the energy-saving potential of MPC by achieving 51.6% reduction in mean cooling power reduction compared to the Thermostat case. Since cooling power in all three cases was measured at the same intervals for the same amount of time, the mean cooling power directly reflects the cooling energy consumption over the test period. The results suggest that the MPC achieved significant cooling energy reduction while improving indoor thermal comfort compared to the original thermostat control. The approximate MPC was able to capture most of the control characteristics of the MPC and retained most of the benefits. While retaining most benefits of the MPC, the approximate MPC greatly reduced the computation load as compared to the MPC. The average CPU processing time needed to generate the cooling power set point for the VAV box in the office in a control interval was 2.5 s in the MPC controller but largely reduced to 0.016 s in the approximate MPC controller. The much higher computation efficiency of the approximate MPC makes it much more adaptable to low-power hardware (e.g., PLC and DDC used in buildings) as compared to the MPC. 3.2 Test results of LT Fig. 10 shows the statistical distributions of room air temperature and indoor PMV measured during class time using the box-and-whisker plots. The room air temperature is measured by the air temperature sensor and the indoor PMV is measured by the globe temperature, air temperature, air velocity and RH sensors as described in Section 2.2.2. The tendency to overcool LT by the reactive BMS can be obviously seen in Fig. 10 (a), as indicated by a mean PMV of − 0.35. Indoor PMV in the BMS case went lower than the lower bound of the comfortable range (PMV = − 0.5), causing occupants to suffer from thermal discomfort, for about 12% of the class time. In contrast, both the MPC and the approximate MPC kept indoor PMV within the comfortable range for all the class time, with a mean indoor PMV of 0.07 and 0.01, respectively. It indicates that significant improvements in thermal comfort were achieved by the MPC and the approximate MPC, as compared to the BMS. Similar to that observed in the office, without the consciousness to save cooling energy, the reactive BMS control tends to overcool LT and kept indoor PMV to be negative for all the class time, suggesting excessive cooling energy used in the BMS case. Fig. 10 (b) shows that both the mean and median room air temperature with the BMS control are 24.1 °C, which is close to the room air temperature set point of 24 °C, indicating the set-point-chasing control characteristic of the BMS. In contrast, both the MPC and the approximate MPC kept indoor PMV close to the thermal neutrality and on the positive side for the majority of time, preventing the overcooling issue. This indicates the control characteristics of MPC in chasing the multiple targets of thermal comfort and minimizing cooling power. The approximate MPC mimicked these control characteristics fairly closely. As an outcome of the control characteristics of the MPC and the approximate MPC, the mean and median room air temperature was 25.2 °C in the MPC case and 25.1 °C in the approximate MPC case. The only attribute that the approximate MPC fell short compared to the MPC was that the approximate MPC could not keep the room conditions as stable as the MPC did. This could be due to the fact that LT was directly subjected to the impacts of weather (walls are directly exposed to outdoor) and highly dynamic occupancy load. The dynamics of heat loads through walls and from occupancy might have added difficulties for the approximate MPC control algorithm. Fig. 11 summarizes the cooling energy consumption of the three cases in LT, which is measured by the energy meter described in Section 2.2.2. Fig. 11 (a) shows the statistical distributions of measured cooling power supplied by the AHU to LT using box-and-whisker plots. Among the three cases, the mean cooling power is the highest in the BMS case with 32.1 kWh. The MPC and the Approximate MPC cases are significantly lower in mean cooling power at 22.3 kWh and 22.1 kWh, respectively. Fig. 11 (b) shows the average weekly ACMV electricity consumption of the three cases. ACMV electricity consumption consists of electricity consumption by the AHU \u2018Fan\u2019 and \u2018Cooling\u2019, which is the thermal cooling power measured across the cooling coil divided by the estimated mean coefficient of performance (COP = 5.39) of the chiller serving LT. The MPC and approximate MPC achieved 36.7% and 36.2% reduction in ACMV electricity consumption as compared to the BMS. The approximate MPC has, again, demonstrated its ability to capture most of the benefits of the MPC, in terms of energy saving and thermal comfort. Similar to the CPU time results observed in the office, the approximate MPC also largely reduced the average CPU processing time needed to generate a cooling power set point for the AHU of LT in a control interval to 0.017 s, from 6.3 s in the MPC. 4 Discussion 4.1 Advantages of approximate MPC in practical implementation In the experiments, the proposed approximate MPC showed a few technical advantages over the MPC in practical implementation. The approximate MPC significantly reduced the computational load, as compared to the MPC with only slightly compromised control performance in terms of thermal comfort and energy saving compared to the MPC but still significantly better than the original reactive-based controls. The approximate MPC is also much easier to be implemented in low-power control hardware (e.g., PLC and DDC) and low-level programming languages, as it does not need to solve optimization problems. Thus, the approximate MPC is much more compatible with existing BMS hardware and software than MPC, which requires high computing power and advanced optimization software with dedicated libraries/tools. The development of approximate MPC adds to the initial development of MPC since approximate MPC would have to \u2018learn\u2019 from MPC. Despite needing additional effort at the initial development stage, approximate MPC can run on low-power hardware for the rest of the building\u2019s operational life whereas MPC requires high-power hardware and advanced optimization software for the entire building operational life. Since approximate MPC can run on typical industrial controllers and its control algorithm is essentially running as a black-box, approximate MPC presents a much smoother learning curve for facility managers as compared to MPC, which has highly explicit building model and optimization algorithm. 4.2 Applicability and limitations of approximate MPC The proposed approximate MPC is developed based on a fully data-driven approach, i.e., when the proposed approximate MPC is implemented in another building, operation data of that particular building will be needed to retrain and update the approximate MPC (in terms of input variables, hidden layer size and model parameters). However, the framework for model and control algorithm configuration (NARX RNN) and the methodology for controller development should be generally applicable. This is demonstrated in the current paper that the approximate MPC controllers in the two different testbeds share an identical model configuration framework and development process, as described in Section 2.1. The only differences are the hidden layer sizes and the input variables, as described in Section 2.4. The two chosen testbeds represent some common built environments. The office has moderate, smooth occupancy load representing typical commercial built environments. LT has high-dynamic and heavy occupancy load, representing high-heat-density built environment. The experiments conducted in this study, to some extent, verified the resilience of the approximate MPC to stochastic disturbances, including internal heat loads and weather conditions. The approximate MPC ran for 10 weekdays in November 2019 in LT, when LT was under stochastic occupancy and weather conditions. The estimated number of occupancy varied between 0 and 180 with a median value of 66, depending on the actual class schedule running in LT. The sky clearness index [45] that represents weather conditions varied between 0.23 and 0.50 with a median value of 0.36 and its distribution is shown in Table 5 . Under the stochastic disturbances, the approximate MPC still achieved most of the benefits of the MPC, in terms of both energy saving and thermal comfort as discussed in Section 3.2. As the approximate MPC \u2018learns\u2019 from the MPC, the resilience of the approximate MPC would continue to improve if a stochastic or robust MPC is employed to generate the building operation data to train the approximate MPC. However, a limitation of the current study is that we could not verify the resilience of the approximate MPC for disturbances that go outside the range covered by the current experiments (internal load dynamics, tropical climate). Table 5 shows that the weather conditions of the approximate MPC test period are representative of the intermediate sky condition, which happens on 95% of days in a year in Singapore according to the Singapore typical meteorological year (TMY) data [46]. The resilience of the approximate MPC for the remaining 5% days with overcast and clear sky conditions could be verified in future studies. Another limitation of this study is that building heating was not considered in the experiments as both testbeds are in tropics, where heating is generally not needed in buildings. Adopting the proposed approximate MPC for regions where heating is needed would require measuring heating power data as one of the inputs for the development and operation of the approximate MPC. 5 Conclusion This paper proposed and developed an approximate MPC using the recurrent neural network with a structure of nonlinear autoregressive network with exogenous inputs to approximate the control laws of MPC for building automation and control applications. The approximate MPC can mimic the behaviors of MPC in controlling buildings without needing to solve the optimization problem. The control performance of the approximate MPC was evaluated through experiments in two testbeds, an office and a lecture theatre, to control their air conditioning systems. The control performance of the approximate MPC was compared to the original reactive controls of the two testbeds as well as MPC. In the office, the MPC and approximate MPC reduced 58.5% and 51.6% of cooling energy consumption, respectively, as compared to the original reactive control. In the lecture theatre, the MPC and approximate MPC reduced 36.7% and 36.2% of cooling energy consumption, respectively, as compared to the original reactive control. The energy performance results suggest that the approximate MPC could retain most of the energy-saving potential of MPC. The approximate MPC also captured most of the thermal comfort performance of the MPC. The approximate MPC controllers were more than 100 times faster than the MPC controllers in both testbeds in determining the control commands for each time step, suggesting that approximate MPC has much lower computational power requirements than MPC. This study demonstrated the feasibility of employing approximate MPC to retain much of the benefits of MPC while largely lowering the control hardware computation power demand for implementation.

        "dc:description": "The adoption of model predictive control (MPC) for building automation and control applications is challenged by the high hardware and software requirements to solve its optimization problem. This study proposes an approximate MPC that mimics the dynamic behaviours of MPC using the recurrent neural network with a structure of nonlinear autoregressive network with exogenous inputs. The approximate MPC is developed by learning from the measured operation data of buildings controlled by MPC, therefore it can produce MPC-like control for buildings without needing to solve the optimization problem, significantly reducing the computation load as compared to MPC. The proposed approximate MPC is implemented in two testbeds, an office and a lecture theatre, to control the air-conditioning systems. The control performance of the approximate MPC is compared to MPC as well as the original reactive control of the two testbeds. The approximate MPC retained most of the energy and thermal comfort performance of MPC in both testbeds. For the office, the MPC and approximate MPC reduced 58.5% and 51.6% of cooling energy consumption, respectively, as compared to the original control. For the lecture theatre, the MPC and approximate MPC reduced 36.7% and 36.2% of cooling energy consumption, respectively, as compared to the original control. Meanwhile, both approximate MPC and MPC significantly improved indoor thermal comfort in the two testbeds as compared to their original control. Despite having minor degradation in control performance the approximate MPC was more than 100 times faster than MPC in generating optimal control commands in each time step.",
