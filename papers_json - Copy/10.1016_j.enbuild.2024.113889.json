Heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) equipment faults and operational errors result in comfort issues and waste of energy in buildings. An Automatic Fault Detection and Diagnosis (AFDD) tool could help facility managers fix comfort and energy issues more efficiently, by identifying the most probable root causes. Existing AFDD methods mostly focus on equipment-level fault detection and diagnostics; almost no attention is given to building level fault diagnosis, considering inter-dependency between equipment through the energy distribution chain. In this work we propose a methodology to automatically derive a Bayesian network from HVAC system topology description such as Haystack. This Bayesian network models and estimates the state of all elements in the system, helping users to identify the most probable root fault. As it is able to ingest evidence from any source (field data, operators, or other models) and is capable of updating its estimates when new evidence is delivered, such a tool could have a great potential to be used interactively on the field. We applied the proposed methodology on simulated and real-world buildings and present in this paper one specific case.

About 40% of energy is consumed in buildings in the European Union [5]. And within buildings, Heating, Ventilation and Air-conditioning (HVAC) systems consume the most energy. HVAC system faults result in comfort issues and waste of energy. In order to help facility managers identify and fix faults more efficiently, it is essential to have an Automatic Fault Detection and Diagnosis (AFDD) tool, which is able to not only detect issues but also identify the root faults. Today's Building Management Systems (BMS) are able to log data from all the sensors, actuators, and controllers of equipment in a building, which promises big potential in fault detection and diagnosis. In real-world HVAC and BMS systems, most alarms are derived from rule-based fault detectors embedded in HVAC Device controllers, and collected by the BMS. Existing AFDD methods mostly focus on equipment-level fault detection and diagnostics. See [22] for a complete review. As a big picture of data-driven approaches, 3 main categories have been explored, at the sensor level with control charts able to detect and diagnose specific equipment faults using direct measurement; at the signal level using statistics and processing methods to extract time series features able to characterize and discriminate varieties of faults; at the level of the building dynamics, using multivariate model and analysis able to characterize more complex faults related to building dynamic changes. The first two categories have been extensively studied and Gunay et al. [8] give a nice overview of almost 30 methods applied to detect faults and a wide list of AHU and VAV faults studied in the literature. The third category is more recently explored. As an example, Turner et al. [25] develop a building HVAC fault detection method based on a data-driven approach and dynamic system modeling. This approach consists in a system identification technique based on recursive least-squares estimation of time-series data, able to model system dynamics and to detect residues between estimates and real measurements. Ajib et al. [1] also develop a methodology based on data-driven models. Hybrid system dynamics are here estimated using a PWARX identification technique, able to extract normal and abnormal modes. However, systems usually consist of a large number of devices and dynamic modes. In practice, analyzing the resulting large number of alarms in order to trace root causes involves a significant amount of manual work and expert knowledge. This includes observing data trend logs (time series) of specific equipment at specific time periods, as well as navigating between associated equipment according to the system topology. Solving this problem automatically requires integrated analysis of the whole system, taking into account the inter-dependency between devices. In previous research, almost no attention has been given to such building-level fault diagnosis, considering inter-dependencies between HVAC devices through the energy distribution chain. We only found three interesting studies working in this area. Schein and Bushby [21] proposed a hierarchical rule-based method to prioritize duplicated or conflicting alarms. This study is very easy to implement in practice. Yet, it only applies to a specific application: the rule-based structure is not flexible to different building configuration, system topology, and data availability. In addition, the method is purely based on empirical rules that need to be tuned for each individual building. Verbert et al. [26] proposed a method based on Bayesian network to deal with equipment inter-dependency in HVAC systems. But this method highly depends on accurate and extensive building simulation to fit the conditional probability tables; therefore is not very easy to deploy in practice. More recently, Chen et al. [4] developed a new HVAC system cross-level fault diagnosis using a novel discrete Bayesian network (DisBN). This consists of causal relations among various components and sub-systems. It well addresses the challenge of cross-level fault diagnostics within a complex HVAC system. In this work, the network model is developed based on physical analysis and domain expert knowledge, but with a lack of automation exploiting existing topology and building metadata. In parallel, recent years have seen the emergence of a promising trend with standardization of building metadata models, taxonomies and ontologies such as Project Haystack [10], IFC/BIM [14], RealEstateCore [9] and Brick [2]. Some BMS systems started to embed such metadata into data point and equipment description. Several work show promising usage: Pruvost and Enge-Rosenblatt [20] leverage metadata and an ad-hoc ontology to provide a monitoring plan and operations advices. Hu et al. [12] associate building objects description with performance objectives and metrics to enable energy efficiency performance assessments. Hosamo et al. [11] rely on a Brick Schema for data integration and flow into a rule-based system for FDD of AHUs. Finally Xie et al. [27] propose a way to describe faults in the Brick ontology, and use it to semantically relate data points to to-be-detected faults, before FDD execution. Our study proposes a new building HVAC AFDD method using a Bayesian network to achieve building-level integrated fault diagnosis using operation data collected by BMS. Our methodology is based on the following proposal: \u2022 A new systematic way of transferring building system topology information and expert knowledge to a Bayesian network able to infer the most probable root fault in the whole system based on comfort violation symptoms and operations data. \u2022 A data-driven approach for extracting Bayesian parameters from BMS database and for designing a complete building-level fault diagnosis Bayesian network. This paper presents this methodology and details its implementation. First a brief introduction of the methodology based on Bayesian network theory is given in section 2. Then the method for constructing the fault diagnosis network from the building topology and from the BMS database is explained in section 3 with an example of its implementation on an HVAC system. Experiments of our methodology on simulated and real buildings are finally presented in section 4. 2 Motivation and methodology 2.1 Motivation Building HVAC systems consist of heterogeneous equipment and systems, from room devices to central equipment, from heating and cooling emitters to hydraulic and air distribution systems. This represents an important technical database of various components, a variety of operating conditions (normal or abnormal, including faulty modes related to all possible degradation or faults) and a vast number of time series of various kind: setpoints, measurements, states, etc. In this study, we propose to use a Bayesian network structure to represent the HVAC topology of a whole building and to achieve the diagnostic of possible faults using knowledge modeled by nodes and connections. Each node indicates the state (such as Normal or Fault) of an HVAC sub-system. The state of some nodes can be directly extracted from BMS data or provided by an operator from manual inspection, or also estimated with equipment-level data-driven fault detection algorithms [7]. Updating the Bayesian network through inference leads to finding posterior distribution of unknown states, leading to finding root causes. The choice of a diagnostic tool based on Bayesian network is based on the main following reasons: \u2022 Bayes rule is a natural way of describing causal or probabilistic relationship between faults and symptoms. The parameters (conditional and prior probability) have clear statistical meaning, and the capability to output fault probabilities is more informative compared to binary fault detection results (normal or fault). \u2022 Expert knowledge and building physics can be embedded into the definition of conditional and prior probabilities, so that the posterior probabilities calculation can reproduce a building manager reasoning more quickly and more efficiently. \u2022 The graphical structure of a Bayesian network is able to mimic the building HVAC system energy chain and is flexible enough to cover most HVAC system topologies. \u2022 Bayesian networks are good in dealing with uncertain, incomplete and even conflicting information, which is very common in building systems. \u2022 Evidence about any node(s) can be provided as input to improve the current diagnosis, which makes it convenient for operators on site. \u2022 Many efficient methods and tools exist to solve Bayesian network inference and belief updating problems. 2.2 Methodology A Bayesian network structure representing a whole building system would contain thousands of nodes, which makes the task of creating or learning it challenging. Existing literature often limits the model scope to sub-systems with a few nodes, such as in [26] where a boiler-AHU-radiator system is modeled. We therefore propose a step-wise methodology, leveraging HVAC automation systems knowledge from standard building metadata, such as Project Haystack [10]. Our methodology starts with defining a new \u201ccontrol flow diagram\u201d descriptive model (section 3.1), that is both modular and extensible: building blocks can be simply assembled together to represent a complete system (section 3.2). We use this descriptive model as a pivot language to extract and structure the relevant HVAC system topology description (section 3.3) and to build the corresponding diagnosis Bayesian network (section 3.4), in a way that can be automated. See Fig. 1. We finally illustrate in section 3.5 the capability of the resulting network to diagnose root faults at system level based on given symptoms. 3 Design of an HVAC fault diagnosis network This section is dedicated to the presentation of our methodology in the objective to design a building diagnosis tool. 3.1 Control flow model of an HVAC sub-system Real building systems on the field present a huge diversity of HVAC systems, as described in [13]. We propose a generic representation able to encompass most typical systems. We define an HVAC sub-system as composed of the HVAC device, together with its controller providing on-off or regulating command, and its recipient system to which it emits heating, cooling, hydraulic or ventilation power. An HVAC sub-system, such as a room radiator system, a hot water heating system or a ventilation system, is usually designed and operated to maintain a controlled variable, such as room temperature, hot water supply temperature, or air flow rate. The HVAC sub-system is regulated according to an enable (boolean) signal and a setpoint signal. Therefore, a generic HVAC sub-system can be represented by a control flow diagram as shown in Fig. 2 . 3.1.1 Controller The Controller is the component regulating the HVAC Device to maintain the controlled variable at the setpoint (regulating controller), or simply switching on and off the HVAC Device (on-off controller). Fig. 2 shows a regulating close-loop controller. Controllers with other types of control loops (open-loop), output signals (two-position, floating, modulating), or control algorithms (dead-band, PI, PID, pulse width modulating) can be represented in a similar way; see also [15]. The enable and setpoint signals usually come from an HMI (Human Machine Interface) either at the room thermostat or in the building management system. They represent the control signals of the HVAC sub-system, and provide the basic criteria to evaluate whether the Controlled Variable is normal or abnormal. 3.1.2 HVAC device The HVAC Device refers to a heating / cooling / ventilating equipment. It is switched on/off or regulated by the Controller to give heating/cooling power or ventilation to the Recipient System to maintain the controlled variable (temperature, pressure, humidity, CO2, etc.). The correct functioning of the HVAC Device depends on the HVAC Component Characteristics and the Energy Sources (if available). 3.1.3 Recipient system The Recipient System refers to a room, a ventilation recipient system (air duct), a hot water recipient system (water tank and piping), etc. To maintain the controlled variable, the Recipient System needs power input from the HVAC Device. The amount of required power is related to the Disturbances, the Recipient System dynamics and the chosen setpoint. If the Recipient System is equipped with Supplemental HVAC, such as ventilation in addition to a room radiator system, the state of the Supplemental HVAC may also impact the Recipient System. 3.2 Connecting sub-systems to model a complete HVAC system The control flow models of various HVAC sub-systems are presented in the Appendix A. This list can be easily extended to develop a complete library covering most common types of HVAC Device, such as the ones mentioned in [13]. By connecting corresponding component variables, we can easily build the control flow model for a whole HVAC system. We use a boiler-pump-radiator system as an example. The system is composed of one boiler, one hot water pump and three radiators serving three rooms individually. The boiler and the pump have on-off control, and the radiator has close loop regulating control. The control flow model of the full system is shown in Fig. 3 . In the next section we describe a methodology to construct such an entire model from the building topology descriptive metadata. 3.3 Transforming building metadata into control flow model In real world buildings, there are very often hundreds of equipment, and thousands of trend data logged in the BMS. In order to diagnose faults, the facility engineer or technician has to know which equipment and which data are related to the fault to be diagnosed. But in a BMS system the trend data and equipment names don't always clearly indicate their meaning, location of the equipment, and relationship between equipment, such as which AHU serves which room. Therefore it is a significant challenge to find the relevant data required to perform fault diagnosis of the complete system. Over recent years, metadata models, taxonomies and ontologies such as Project Haystack [10], IFC/BIM [14], Brick [2] have been developed to standardize the description of building topology, HVAC systems, and associated trend data. Some BMS systems start to embed standard metadata models, for example by adding Haystack or Brick tags into data point and equipment description. These metadata are essential to link fault diagnostic algorithms to real BMS data at scale. We have developed our method based on Haystack. With Haystack, a building is described by a list of entities that represent all of its constitutive elements: site, floor, room, equipment, measurement point, setpoint... Each entity is associated with an id (e.g. `@a-001'), descriptive tags that may contain a value (e.g. `equip' or `area: 55000ft 2 '), and relationships to other entities (e.g. `chilledWaterRef: @a-07b8'). The complete building description can be exported to various formats such as CSV, or semantic web formats as JSON-LD or Turtle. An example of such description is illustrated in Fig. 4 below. This description corresponds to the boiler-pump-radiator example presented previously in Fig. 3. For readability purposes, relationships are indicated with arrows. We propose to leverage the Haystack description of a building to automate the process of creating the control flow model presented in 3.2. If the BMS data points are properly tagged using Haystack, these tags are automatically used to create the control flow diagram of the whole building. They are also used to associate the BMS data points to the corresponding signals in this diagram. In the following we are going to use the boiler-pump-radiator example to illustrate how this process is done. Fig. 4 shows all the Haystack objects of this system. Converting this description into a control flow model consists in the following 3 steps: Step 1: list HVAC sub-systems and find their type From the Haystack meta-data, get a list of all objects which have tag \u2018hvac\u2019 and \u2018equip\u2019, which means HVAC Device. Based on the additional tags, use Table 1 to map each equipment to an HVAC sub-system model from the control flow library (see Appendix A). Step 2: find all available signals for each HVAC sub-system For each equipment entity \u2018XY\u2019, get a list of all entities which have tag \u2018point\u2019, and \u2018equip=XY\u2019. They represent the data points (timeseries) available for this equipment. Use the mapping table of the appropriate HVAC sub-system model (for example Table 2 for Room Radiator, Table 3 for Pump and Boiler) to map these entities to the control flow signal according to their available tags. Step 3: connect HVAC sub-systems Based on the reference tags of each equipment, define the inter-relationship between the HVAC sub-systems. Fig. 4 indicates that the hot water of the three radiators \u2018@a-004\u2019, \u2018@a-005\u2019, and \u2018@a-006\u2019 are provided by the boiler \u2018@a-002\u2019 and pump \u2018@a-003\u2019. With this methodology, we can now convert building descriptive data to control flow model, if the Haystack tags are correctly set. 3.4 From control flow model to fault diagnostics Bayesian network In previous sections we described a control flow model (3.1) and a generic procedure to obtain it from a building description (3.3). We now describe how to build a Bayesian network according to the control flow model and perform fault diagnostics. 3.4.1 Bayesian network essentials Bayesian networks are graph structures used for representing the probabilistic relationships among a large number of variables and for doing probabilistic inference (reasoning) with those variables. It was first developed by Judea Pearl in 1980s [18]. Nodes and edges form the structure of a Bayesian network. Each node represents a random variable. In this study we focus on categorical random variables. Directed edges are added from parent nodes to child nodes, to indicate direct influence. Parameters are given to each node to describe the prior (node without parent) or conditional (node with parents) probabilities. They are defined as prior probability tables (PPT) and conditional probability tables (CPT) respectively. If the state of a node is observed, it is known as evidence. When we are absolutely sure about the state of the node, we set the probability of this state to one or zero. This is called hard evidence. Sometimes the information we have is not absolutely reliable, or the measurement we observe is subject to uncertainty. In this case we set the states to a probability between zero and one, and call it uncertain evidence. Mrad et al. [16] provided a comprehensive review of uncertain evidence in Bayesian networks. There are two types of uncertain evidences [19]: \u2022 Soft evidence can be interpreted as \u201cevidence of uncertainty\u201d. It is used when one is certain about a probability distribution of one or more variables. For example, posting evidence { Fault=0.9; Normal=0.1 } for a variable V means that the probability distribution of V is 0.9/0.1 with absolute certainty. As such, this probability distribution will not be updated in the belief updating process, as opposed to virtual evidence. \u2022 Virtual evidence can be interpreted as \u201cevidence with uncertainty\u201d. It is used when one is uncertain about a claim of a hard evidence. Evidence { Fault=0.9; Normal=0.1 } for a variable V means that the user is 90% sure that the state of V is Fault. During belief updating, the posterior probability is calculated taking into account the likelihood ratio of this node and the states of other nodes in the network. In our study, we propose to use virtual evidence to integrate individual equipment fault detection likelihood results into the diagnosis network. The process of computing the posterior distribution of variables given evidence is known as probabilistic inference (also formerly known as belief updating). Many inference algorithms exist, including exact methods such as variable elimination, poly-tree message passing and junction trees, and approximate methods such as Monte Carlo simulation and belief propagation. See [17,3]. We now present how each aspect of the Bayesian network is created from the control flow model: Structure first (nodes and edges), then Parameters: prior probabilities and conditional probabilities. 3.4.2 Structure Leveraging the generic control flow model of an HVAC sub-system illustrated in Fig. 2 we can easily build a sub-part of the fault diagnostics Bayesian network, abusively defined as \u201cfault diagnostic Bayesian sub-network\u201d and shown in Fig. 5 . We now describe the method element by element, as for the generic control flow model (section 3.1). 1. The Controlled Variable is represented by a node in the Bayesian sub-network named Symptom node, with state either Normal or Abnormal. The Abnormal state encompasses all situations where the controlled variable does not behave as expected by the system. Note that for convenience the Abnormal state may be renamed with a name related to the actual variable name. For example Low if the controlled variable is a Pressure, Low (resp. High) if it is a temperature during heating (resp. cooling) season, etc. 2. Each of the three blocks in the control flow model: Controller, HVAC Device, and Recipient system, also becomes one node in the Bayesian sub-network, named Fault node and representing its status: \u2022 the Controller node has states: Normal for normal behavior; Fault for abnormal one; Disabled to take into account periods of time where the control is deactivated (typically based on the BMS Schedule), \u2022 the HVAC Device node has states: Normal for normal behavior; Fault for abnormal one, \u2022 the Recipient system node has states: Zero for no load (for example when a room does not need heating because the external temperature and internal gains are sufficient); Normal for normal load (normal need for heating or cooling); High load for abnormally high loads (for example when a window is left open in a room and the heating system cannot compensate). 3. The vertical arrows on top of the blocks in the control flow model represent properties and external inputs. Each of these signals becomes an independent parent node of its associated block node in the Bayesian sub-network: \u2022 For the HVAC Device node (e.g. Radiator), Fault state is likely to be caused by abnormal HVAC Component characteristic (e.g. Radiator valve, heat exchanger) or abnormal Energy source (e.g. Supply Water Temperature, Supply Water Pressure). The first is represented by a Fault node with states Normal and Fault. The latter is represented by the Controlled Variable node of another Bayesian sub-network. \u2022 For the Recipient system node (e.g. Room), the High/Normal/Zero load state is a function of the System Characteristics (e.g. the Building Enclosure), Disturbances (e.g. Outdoor air temperature), and Supplemental HVAC (if available) states. The first two are represented either by a Fault node with states Normal and Fault, or by a Disturbance node with ad-hoc states. The latter is represented by the Controlled Variable node of another Bayesian sub-network. 3.4.3 Structure properties The choices described in 3.4.2 lead to the following desirable properties: \u2022 Minimal need for parameter learning. The structure of the Bayesian network is purposely designed to minimize the necessity of estimating (or learning) and tuning the prior and conditional probabilities. Indeed, most of the state variable dependencies are binary logic, which means the conditional probabilities are either 1 or 0. For example when a controller has Fault state, controlled variable is Abnormal with a probability of 1. The only conditional probability that needs to be estimated based on expert knowledge is the one of the Recipient System node. The associated probability tables (PPTs and CPTs) and other parameters are detailed in 3.4.4 and in 3.4.5. \u2022 Composability. The above standard design of Bayesian sub-network structure is used to model each HVAC sub-system in the global system. In the objective to design a diagnosis tool based on a complete Bayesian network, our method consists in connecting Bayesian sub-networks, mirroring connections between HVAC sub-systems that compose the HVAC system in a building. The connections of different sub-systems are built between the Controlled Variable node of the energy sources and the HVAC Device node of the energy consumers. As an example, the complete fault diagnosis network of the boiler-pump-radiator topology is given in Fig. 6 . Finally, note that the horizontal arrows in the control flow model represent input and output signals for the three blocks Controller, HVAC Device, and Recipient system. These do not directly appear in the Bayesian sub-network structure, but we will see in next section that the conditional probability tables (CPT) are designed to reflect these connections. In addition, the behavior of the outputs reacting to the inputs can be used by an expert or an algorithm to reveal the state of the blocks (generate evidence). 3.4.4 Parameters: prior probabilities Once HVAC diagnosis sub-networks as shown in Fig. 5 are connected into a complete diagnosis network as shown in Fig. 6, the nodes remaining without parents are root cause nodes. We propose below two strategies to set prior probabilities for these nodes, depending on their kind: Disturbance nodes or Fault nodes. Note that in the example of Fig. 6 there are one root Disturbance node (Outdoor air temperature) and nine root Fault nodes (Control ×3, Boiler, Tank and piping heat loss, Pump, Piping resistance, Radiator valve/heat exchanger, Building enclosure). 1. Disturbance nodes refer to variables such as outdoor air temperature, total heating demand of the hot water system, etc. They reflect the usage context of the system. Their prior probability distribution can for example be obtained from historical data, or expert knowledge. Table 4 illustrates a prior probability table for an Outdoor air temperature node corresponding to a classical yearly distribution in Europe. In real-life systems, this prior probability table (PPT) should be updated periodically to better fit to actual conditions (e.g. one distinct probability table for heating/mid-season/cooling seasons or quarterly, monthly, weekly...). Finally note that some Disturbance state variables can be actually monitored. The state derived from live observations can be posted as evidence on the node to further refine its status. 2. Fault nodes correspond to the failure of a specific equipment or building component. The relative importance of prior probabilities set for the various Fault nodes across the entire network has a significant impact on the final diagnosis result (most probable fault for a given set of symptoms); these should therefore be carefully defined. The prior probability of equipment fault can be derived from a failure rate model if one is available, such as the well-known bathtub failure rate (see [23] or [6] for a review). When no such model is known, prior probabilities of faults may be estimated based on field experience. In the boiler-pump-radiator example, the prior probability of all root fault nodes is empirically set to 0.1. 1 1 All prior probabilities of root faults are set arbitrarily equal because there is no reason to think that some root faults are more likely than others at this stage. If a different value is used (for example, 0.2 instead of 0.1), although the inferred posterior probabilities are modified, in our experiments we did not observe any change in the ranking of root faults, hence no impact on the final diagnosis. On the contrary, if a prior probability is changed on a single root cause (higher or lower), its corresponding posterior will see the subsequent value changed in the same direction. Expert feedback on the frequency of the various faults would enable us to refine the various priors. 3.4.5 Parameters: conditional probabilities All nodes with parents have to be associated with conditional probability tables (CPT) representing their probabilistic relationship with the parent nodes. We propose below one strategy for each type of node, to define these tables. 1. Symptom nodes represent the fault status of controlled variables. We propose to assume a logical causal relationship between the states of these nodes and their parents, encoded by the following expert rules: \u2022 When the load of the Recipient System is High (higher than the maximum power output of the HVAC Device), the Symptom node is Abnormal (e.g. temperature is Low in heating season) in any case, as the controlled variable can't possibly reach the normal range even if the entire HVAC system is working properly. \u2022 When the load of the Recipient System is Normal (above zero and smaller than the maximum power output of the HVAC Device), the controlled variable needs to be regulated by a working HVAC system to be normal. Therefore the Symptom node is only Normal when the Controller and the HVAC Device are both Normal. A Controller fault (including disability) or a HVAC Device failure will all cause Symptom node to be Abnormal. \u2022 When the load of the Recipient System is Zero, the controlled variable does not need to be regulated to be normal. The Symptom node is therefore Normal in any case. This is the case typically for room and air heating or cooling systems in transition seasons. Some HVAC sub-systems however never meet a \u2018zero load\u2019 situation: for example, pumps might be powered on during all the heating season, and ventilation fans throughout the entire year, to maintain water pressure and air pressure. The above proposed logic translates into the conditional probability table in Table 5 . 2. For HVAC Device nodes we also propose to assume a logical causal relationship between the states of these nodes and their parents, encoded by the following expert rule: if HVAC Component Characteristics has state Fault or Energy Source (when applicable) has state Abnormal, then HVAC Device has state Fault. For example in the case of the room radiator system, HVAC Component Characteristics has state Fault when the valve is stuck close or the heat exchanger is blocked. Abnormal Energy Source refers to either abnormal hot water temperature or abnormal pressure, which are the Symptom nodes of two other HVAC sub-systems (Hot water sub-system and Hydraulic sub-system), and therefore are themselves caused by other faults. By connecting the HVAC Device node to the Energy Source parent node, the inter-dependency between HVAC sub-systems, or the causal relationship between faults in different HVAC sub-systems are represented in the Bayesian network. The above proposed logic translates into the conditional probability table in Table 6 . 3. For Recipient System nodes we propose to learn their conditional probabilities from historical data. In correctly sized HVAC sub-systems, High recipient system load is caused by Abnormal System Characteristics, subject to certain conditions related to Disturbances. In the room radiator system example, Disturbances refer to weather (outside temperature, solar radiation, etc.) and internal heat gains, System Characteristics refer to the building enclosure heat transfer coefficient and heat capacity. If the radiator has the right size, in normal situations, the heat capacity should always be able to cover the system load. High system loads are caused by building enclosure fault, such as an open window or a damaged insulation, and only appears when the outside temperature is low. The conditional probability table of Recipient System nodes can be learned from disturbances data and corresponding system load data in normal case and fault case. An alternative when historical data is missing is to simplify the network by removing the Disturbance and System characteristics nodes, such that only prior distribution needs to be learnt for Recipient System from past data. Table 7 gives an example of the heat load distribution of building enclosure Normal (window closed) and Fault (window opened) case, for the boiler-pump-radiator example. 3.5 Fault diagnosis decision A big advantage of Bayesian network is its flexibility in data availability: any node can receive evidence, and all available evidence is leveraged for inference. Fault diagnosis can thus be performed in an incremental fashion: users or systems provide evidence, then inference is executed to get the probability of all root fault nodes and find out the most possible one. New evidence can then be posted and the probabilities updated, etc. We propose that indubitable observations such as low temperature are posted as hard evidence, while uncertain observations or results, such as individual equipment fault detection results from another system or algorithm (when available) are posted as virtual evidence. We now present an example of such a diagnosis process, starting with an observed symptom: a low room temperature in room 1, posted as hard evidence on the associated Symptom node of the network (Case 1). We then consider situations with an increasing amount of evidence posted into the network, mimicking the progress of an assisted human inspection (Cases 2 to 5). Inference results after each new evidence are shown in Table 8 , one column per inference run. Room 1 Temperature Symptom node is listed, as well as Symptom nodes of the sub-systems which are served by the same energy source (room temperature of other rooms). Updated probabilities are provided for all root fault nodes and intermediate fault nodes that are direct or indirect parents of the symptom nodes. As we can see, with only the \u2018Room 1 low temperature\u2019 evidence, all possible root faults have similar probabilities (Case 1). We can check the outdoor air temperature to see if it is the direct cause. Observing \u2018Medium\u2019 external temperature does not change the diagnosis as this is not a direct valid reason for a low temperature in rooms (Case 2). Once it is known that the other rooms served by the same hot water system all have normal temperature, although the hot water system temperature and water flow information are not available, the Bayesian network is able to infer that the root fault is most probably located in room 1 (Case 3). By observing the room temperature control signals, we can identify whether they are normal or not. Assuming that the valve control signal is already at maximum, which is correct reaction to the temperature deviation to the setpoint, we can set the controller fault node probability to zero. Now the most probable fault is either radiator mechanical fault (valve or heat exchanger), or building enclosure fault (such as the window in room 1 is open) (Case 4). By observing how room temperature is reacting to the heating valve opening degree, we can create virtual evidence representing how likely it is that the radiator has a mechanical problem: likely (0.8, Case 5) or not (0.2, alternate Case 5'); posting this evidence in the network results in the correct fault being isolated. 4 Experiment and discussion on real case studies In this session we apply our methodology to build the fault diagnosis network of HVAC system of one real office building \u2018Retz\u2019 located in Nantes, France. The building is equipped with heat pumps and air handling units (AHU) as central HVAC devices, and with floor heating, fan coil units (FCU) and variable air volume box (VAV) in the rooms. The system topology is shown in Fig. 7 . There are 55 rooms, more than 800 points with data trends in total. The corresponding building information Haystack model, which was created specifically for this study, is illustrated in Fig. 8 . Because of the space limitation, the points are not included in the diagram. 4.1 Network structure and parameters We create the fault diagnosis network based on the Haystack model, following the procedure described in 3.4. In this building, AHUs serve as Supplemental HVAC for the room Recipient system (see Fig. 5). Since the AHUs provide fresh air to rooms with the supply temperature close to room temperature, in normal condition, they have very little influence on the heating and cooling load of the rooms. For this reason, we removed AHUs in this study to simplify the Bayesian network structure. The diagnosis focuses only on the FCUs in rooms, the associated heat pumps and the distribution pumps. As heating and cooling seasons are independent we model each equipment by two HVAC sub-systems (two Bayesian sub-networks) representing heating and cooling functions respectively, and sharing common Recipient System and HVAC Device Characteristic. The fault diagnosis network is shown in Fig. 9 . 4.2 Evidence and inference results In this case study, hard evidence is obtained every hour from real operation supervision data. The state of controlled temperature variables is obtained by comparing the actual room temperature to the setpoint during building operation hours with a 0.5°C tolerance. The general heat pump controller state is obtained from the heating season status. Pump controller states are obtained from the corresponding data point. Finally, we simulate availability of virtual evidence about the Fan Coil Units with a pre-recorded evidence signal. Probabilities of all possible fault nodes are calculated through inference to find out the most probable root fault cause. The whole process is executed automatically in a Python program using the SMILE reasoning engine from BayesFusion, through its PySMILE Python wrapper [24]. Fault diagnostics for one specific hour takes less than a second. Going through a whole year of data takes about half an hour, which is reasonable speed. Using this method, we have successfully revealed some issues, even with incomplete historical data. Below is one example. On July the 6th, during the cooling season, heat pump data missing. It is unknown whether the heat pumps were running or not. We now investigate this case to see if the Bayesian network is tolerant to missing data and still able to correctly identify that heats pumps are not running correctly. The symptoms are abnormally high temperatures in rooms 21, 33, 45, and 46. An extract of the inference results for these four rooms is shown in Fig. 10 . In all four rooms, the valve correctly opens to cool down and maintain room temperature at the setpoint. Based on this evidence as well as all others, the Bayesian network was able to correctly identify that the heat pump is not in cooling mode (probability 90%). This indicates that the high temperature in four rooms is caused by the conflict between room FCU and heat pump heating / cooling mode. 4.3 Other experimental results We conducted two other experiments to test the generalization capabilities of our approach. \u2022 with a \u201cdigital twin\u201d simulation model of one Schneider Electric building (GreenOValley 38TEC-T11) in Grenoble. The model was created with IDA-ICE and simplified by removing some rooms and replacing the heat pump models with simple boiler and chiller models. The final model results in 56 FCU-equipped rooms, 3 AHUs, 1 chiller with 2 pumps and 1 boiler with 2 pumps. \u2022 with the real GreenOValley 38TEC-T11 building In both cases we were able to successfully describe the entire system using the control flow approach (Fig. 11 ) and to use resulting Bayesian networks to detect root faults based on available evidence (Fig. 12 ). 5 Conclusion In this study we propose a new method to design a diagnosis tool for HVAC faults at the whole building level, based on the use of a Bayesian network. This Bayesian network has a flexible and modular structure, with \u201cBayesian sub-networks\u201d modeling HVAC sub-systems so that whole systems can be represented easily. As this construction heavily relies on expert knowledge, we propose a generic \u201ccontrol flow\u201d system description that makes it easier for experts to describe sub-systems, and that is used as an intermediate step in the Bayesian network construction. An initial library of such \u201ccontrol flow\u201d sub-systems, used in this study, is provided in Appendix A. Assuming that such a library is available and that the building topology is correctly described \u2013 for example by Haystack tags \u2013 we propose a step-wise approach to create the complete Bayesian network in an automated way. Its parameters (PPTs and CPTs) are defined either from rules or historical data. The resulting model fusions different type of data from sensors to field observations, and can integrate virtual evidence for example from other fault detection systems. It is able to deal with inter-dependencies between various HVAC devices in order to perform global fault diagnosis and isolation of root cause faults. The method has been tested on data from real and simulated office buildings. It revealed to be flexible with HVAC system topology and data availability, requires small computational effort, and provides good diagnosis accuracy. To enable this tool to be used operationally, remaining work needs to be done, as: \u2022 an exhaustive \u201ccontrol flow\u201d library of possible HVAC Systems (see Appendix A), associated with a clear way to map them from the Haystack topology description (similar to part 3.3) \u2022 a prior data quality check and pre-process, in particular on time series data to avoid diagnosis errors, and to identify sensor faults (bias, drift, offline, outliers, etc.) \u2022 an \u201cinteractive wizard\u201d tool for the Facility Manager, with intuitive user-friendly results display overlayed on the actual system synoptics, as well as easy-to-enter field evidence inputs In real-world systems, manual inspection of room temperatures or machine states is not always simple and fast; it can become intractable as the building size grows, or even unfeasible for state variables that are not monitored. Future work will explore how users could leverage data-driven methods \u2013 in particular equipment-level fault detection models \u2013 to derive virtual evidence and eventually ease the diagnosis process. For example, using supervised machine learning regression models to detect faults on Air Handling Units [7] and generate virtual evidence.

Appendix A Examples of specific HVAC sub-systems In this section, the generic control flow model is created for several specific HVAC sub-system, and the fault diagnostics Bayesian sub-networks are derived accordingly, following the methodology presented in section 3. Finally, a summary is given in Table A.1 . A.1 Room radiator Fig. A.1 illustrates the control flow model of a room radiator sub-system. The radiator valve is regulated by the controller according to the room temperature and the setpoint. The heating power provided by the radiator to the room depends on the valve status and heat exchanger, but also on the hot water supplied as input to the radiator. Finally, the amount of heat required by the room is dependent on weather and building enclosure. The associated fault diagnostic Bayesian sub-network is illustrated in Fig. A.2. A.2 Hot water Fig. A.3 illustrates the control flow model of a hot water sub-system. The boiler is regulated by the controller to maintain the supply water temperature at the setpoint. The boiler gives heating power to the hot water system to cover the heating demand of all associated rooms and the tank and piping heat loss. The associated fault diagnostic Bayesian sub-network is illustrated in Fig. A.4 . A.3 Hydraulic Fig. A.5 illustrates the control flow model of a hydraulic sub-system. The pump is regulated by the controller to maintain the supply water pressure at the setpoint. The pump gives hydraulic power, which refers to the combined pressure and flow rate the pump is able to provide to the piping, as can be illustrated in a pump curve shown in Fig. A.7. The pressure and corresponding flow rate is given by the pump speed. Disturbances are the resistances given by the position of all the valves in the piping. If the piping system is blocked or has leakage (Piping Resistance status is Abnormal), the pump would not be able to provide enough power to maintain the water pressure and water flow (Piping System status is High load). The associated fault diagnostic Bayesian sub-network is illustrated in Fig. A.6 . A.4 Ventilation Fig. A.8 illustrates the control flow model of a ventilation sub-system. The ventilation power refers to the combined pressure and flow rate the air fan is able to provide. It is defined by the fan curve (similar to the pump curve). If the duct is blocked or has leakage (Duct Resistance status is Abnormal), the fan would not be able to provide enough power to maintain the air pressure and air flow (Duct System status is High load). The associated fault diagnostic Bayesian sub-network is illustrated in Fig. A.9 . A.5 Chilled water Fig. A.10 illustrates the control flow model of a chilled water sub-system. The chiller is regulated by the controller to maintain the chilled water temperature at the setpoint. The chiller gives cooling power to the chilled water system. The cooling function is dependent on the functioning of the compressor, heat exchanger, and expansion valve, as well as the condenser water temperature and water flow. The chilled water cooling load is given by the total cooling demand from all served equipment to the system and tank and piping heat loss. The associated fault diagnostic Bayesian sub-network is illustrated in Fig. A.11 . A.6 Summary Table A.1 summarizes the representation of the systems described previously. References [1] B. Ajib S.

An Automatic Fault Detection and Diagnosis (AFDD) tool could help facility managers fix comfort and energy issues more efficiently, by identifying the most probable root causes. Existing AFDD methods mostly focus on equipment-level fault detection and diagnostics; almost no attention is given to building level fault diagnosis, considering inter-dependency between equipment through the energy distribution chain. In this work we propose a methodology to automatically derive a Bayesian network from HVAC system topology description such as Haystack. This Bayesian network models and estimates the state of all elements in the system, helping users to identify the most probable root fault. As it is able to ingest evidence from any source (field data, operators, or other models) and is capable of updating its estimates when new evidence is delivered, such a tool could have a great potential to be used interactively on the field. We applied the proposed methodology on simulated and real-world buildings and present in this paper one specific case.",
