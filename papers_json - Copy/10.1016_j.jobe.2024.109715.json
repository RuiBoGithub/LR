Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, China. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology China Global energy consumption for space heating and cooling is significant, referred to as thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs). Due to the large thermal mass of buildings, TCLs are increasingly utilized in demand response (DR) events to balance electricity supply and demand. Priority Stack-Based Control (PSBC) is a common strategy for coordinating TCLs, showing potential in reducing peak loads and shifting TCL loads. However, there are limited studies that have demonstrated and evaluated the performance of PSBC in real-world settings. Additionally, PSBC lacks an effective mechanism to simultaneously ensure tracking performance and thermal comfort. This study developed and tested vanilla and modified PSBC strategies for reducing TCL loads during DR events. A framework for deploying these strategies is proposed, involving cloud-based implementation and hardware configuration. The vanilla and modified PSBC strategies was evaluated through a 22-day field test in a real office building, in terms of load tracking and thermal comfort. The results demonstrate that the modified strategy shows better control performance, evidenced by improvements in the subscribed performance index (SPI), coefficient of variation of root mean square error (CVRMSE) for load tracking, and thermal comfort. Additionally, the control performance is investigated when direct ON/OFF switching control is replaced by indoor temperature setpoint adjustment. Unexpected power oscillation behavior occurs with significant temperature differences between the setpoint and the indoor temperature. Our work provides practical evaluations that quantify PSBC control performance and presents a compelling case for the feasibility of PSBC as a method for reducing peak demand in commercial buildings.

The future of energy is increasingly reliant on renewable sources, such as wind and solar power. However, these renewable generation technologies are inherently unstable, intermittent, and unpredictable. The extensive integration of these variable generating sources into the power grid introduces a high degree of uncertainty, posing significant challenges to the operation and control of the existing power system [1]. Consequently, one of the primary concerns in smart grid research revolves around ensuring power balance amid the uncertainty associated with renewable energy sources [2]. Buildings emerge as influential contributors to energy consumption within the spectrum of demand-side response resources. Buildings, with their substantial electrical power usage and extensive thermal storage capacity, possess immense potential for offering diverse grid services essential for integrating volatile renewable sources. Notably, thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs) present in residential and commercial buildings stand out as exceptionally flexible resources capable of absorbing the uncertainties associated with renewable generation [3]. In the United States, TCLs account for 48 % of the electricity consumed in commercial buildings [4]. On the other hand, the large thermal capacity of buildings can be used to shift TCLs according to systems\u2019 needs while preserving the customers\u2019 comfort levels [5]. 1.1 The related studies To fully exploit the energy flexibility potential of TCLs, it is essential to study the optimal coordination of multiple flexible loads considering their diversified response characteristics and availability [6]. Some studies applied advanced control algorithms for demand response, such as model predictive control (MPC) [7] and reinforcement learning (RL) [8]. Zemtsov et al. [9] created a price-responsive control system to aggregate and manage a population of thermostatically regulated loads. The control goal is to reduce the operational cost of the population. Zheng et al. [10] developed an MPC-based bottom-up proactive method to leverage the thermal inertia of residential thermal appliances for avoiding household peak load without relying on time-varying tariffs. The simulation findings confirmed the validation of considerable peak reductions and good performance in avoiding concurrent appliance operation without compromising thermal comfort. Coccia et al. [11] integrated the ANN-based MPC routine into the building simulation environment, unlocking the energy flexibility of TCLs using variable setpoints. The simulation results indicated the possibility of reducing electrical energy consumption up to −71 % compared to a reference case with a rule-based control. Lankeshwara and Sharma [12] presented an end-user privacy and thermal comfort preserving approach for residential TCLs to provide demand response (DR) in grid services under uncertainties. According to their study, household-level local controllers are based on robust MPC that relies on a minimum of household-specific information while accounting for thermal model parameter uncertainties and forecast errors associated with exogenous inputs. The findings show that precise monitoring of the load setpoint signal may be achieved under a wide range of uncertainties while maintaining end users' thermal comfort. Kazmi et al. [13] presented a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for black-box modelling. The multi-agent modelling and control framework is evaluated over an entire year of operation in a large-scale pilot, constituting over 50 houses, resulting in energy savings of almost 200 kWh per household. Since advanced control methods are often criticized for intensive computation, scalable control strategies for large-scale TCLs have been proposed [14,15]. The temperature priority stack-based control (PSBC) is a common strategy for aggregated TCLs control [16,17]. In this strategy, TCL units are turned ON/OFF based on a priority list determined by the difference between the current temperature measurement and the temperature bounds. The PSBC strategy requires no optimization, and the only computation time is that required for list sorting. As a result, this method is suggested to be more appropriate for managing large-scale TCLs. Radaideh et al. [18] proposed novel modeling and control frameworks to assess the underlying capability of TCLs to provide long-term services such as load-shifting and sustained load reductions. According to simulation results, both services may be accomplished by 1000 heterogeneous TCLs represented by air conditioners. However, consequences on customer comfort are expected to be proportional to the extracted service. For instance, an average setpoint increase of 3.8 °F results from a sustained average power reduction of 319 kW. Hu et al. [19] extended the PSBC for 500 TCLs by incorporating a novel swapping algorithm to improve thermal comfort and by deriving a bound for the regulation signal within which tracking is guaranteed. The modified PSBC was further used for peak load reduction and load shaping in HVAC and refrigeration systems in commercial buildings [20]. The findings demonstrate that a 60-kW reduction in peak demand is feasible. The proposed strategy was then implemented in a gymnasium building with four rooftop HVAC units, showing over 15 % peak demand reduction savings while maintaining or lowering energy consumption. Additionally, the authors presented a framework for modeling, scheduling, and controlling residential TCLs to offer multiple grid services, including energy shifting, peak load reduction, and ancillary services [21]. In Ref. [22], the PSBC was applied to control a large population of HVAC loads for fast primary frequency regulation. There is much less need for communication with the help of the suggested control architecture. The findings of the simulation show that by using the suggested control structure, HVAC units may be dispatched more effectively at the central control level and quickly at the local control level. Despite significant research efforts dedicated to investigating the PSBC performance in residential and commercial buildings, it has three limitations that are not addressed by existing works. Firstly, most existing studies evaluate the control performance of the PSBC algorithm to directly manage ON/OFF operation based on simulation. Their research shows that the PSBC algorithm has excellent tracking performance and good robustness in simulations. However, there are lack of the presence of real-life implementation. Uncertainties in real-world applications may impact the algorithm's effectiveness. Secondly, though the current PSBC strategy tracks the regulation signal as best as it can, HVAC units may turn ON/OFF based on internal thermostat controls to ensure thermal comfort with altering the aggregate power consumption, making it challenging to guarantee tracking performance. Consequently, an effective mechanism is required to ensure the tracking of the regulation signal and thermal comfort during a DR event. Lastly, temperature setpoint control, another control strategy for TCLs, is also considered suitable for demand response and guaranteeing the stability and reliability of the grid [23]. However, there are few studies to investigate the control performance and compare the control performance of managing the ON/OFF status and temperature setpoint control. Moreover, the impact of the introduced temperature setpoint control on TCLs\u2019 operations remains unclear. 1.2 Scope and objectives To address the challenges mentioned earlier, this study introduces a comprehensive framework for coordinating TCLs in an office building to facilitate demand response. The primary objectives can be summarized as follows: 1. Bringing the PSBC technology to real-life applications: A robust framework has been developed, integrating cloud deployment and hardware configuration, to facilitate the implementation of both the vanilla and proposed PSBC strategies. The control performance of these strategies has been rigorously tested and evaluated in a Foshan, China, office building over a 22-day field test. 2. Proposing a modified PSBC strategy to enhance tracking performance: We extend the vanilla PSBC by adding a tracking target modified mechanism, which initially turns ON/OFF that TCLs do not meet the comfort requirements and subsequently adjusts the tracking power consumption, without altering the aggregate power consumption. The tracking target modified mechanism is essential for satisfying the tracking requirement while maintaining thermal comfort. 3. Comparing ON/OFF control and temperature setpoint adjustment: We implemented direct ON/OFF switching control and temperature setpoint adjustment for both the vanilla and proposed strategies. Subsequently, we compared the control performance of these two strategies. The remainder of this study is structured as follows. Section 2 provides detailed information on the implementation of the PSBC controller, encompassing the site description, details of demand response events and baselines, hardware configuration, and the various PSBC algorithms utilized. Section 3 presents the results derived from the field experiments, where we assess the performance of the proposed PSBC strategy by analyzing the Subscribed Performance Index (SPI), Coefficient of Variation of the Root Mean Square Error (CVRMSE), and discomfort. In Section 4, we discuss the findings resulting from the comparison between ON/OFF control and temperature control, and also address inherent limitations in our work. Lastly, Section 5 presents the key conclusions drawn from this study. 2 Methodology This section outlines the design of the field test, encompassing the building description, DR events, baselines, the structure of the PSBC algorithm, and the introduction of key performance metrics. 2.1 Site description An office building in Foshan, Guangdong Province, China, is employed to test the PSBC algorithms. The case building is an office building with a total floor area of 6312 m2, as shown in Fig. 1 . The design overall U value of the exterior wall is 1.94 W/(m2 K), which meets the requirements of the national building code. Due to their high part-load performance, flexible control, and ease of installation and maintenance, variable refrigerant flow (VRF) systems are becoming increasingly popular in small and medium-sized commercial buildings. The site utilizes multiple VRF systems for both cooling in the summer and heating in the winter, with each system comprising an outdoor unit and several indoor units [24]. For this study, we have chosen 15 sets of VRF system with total 110 indoor units to test the PSBC strategies. The cooling capacity of the outdoor unit in the selected VRF system ranges from 12 kW to 24 kW, while the cooling capacity of the indoor unit ranges from 1.5 kW to 3 kW. Each indoor unit of VRF system can be treated as a TCL, and thus, we develop and apply the PSBC strategies to schedule and manage the ON/OFF status of TCLs in common areas, ensuring power consumption follows the temperature constraints on zone temperature T z u = 26 °C and T z l = 24 °C during the DR events. 2.2 DR events and baselines 2.2.1 DR events Typically, DR events are determined, either directly or indirectly, by an energy provider through an aggregator of consumers negotiating on the wholesale electricity energy market for demand decreases and their values during these events. In this case study, two distinct DR scenarios are defined for weekdays and weekends due to different energy patterns, illustrating the algorithms [25]. The first event occurs on weekdays between 3 p.m. and 5 p.m., hereinafter referred to as the target period for the weekday DR event. The second event occurs on weekends between 1 p.m. and 3 p.m., hereinafter referred to as the target period for the weekend DR event. These target periods are highlighted in the green area of Fig. 2 . 2.2.2 DR baseline An estimate of the amount of electricity that a demand resource would have consumed in the absence of a DR event is termed a demand baseline. The power consumption values represented by the blue lines during the specified target periods in Fig. 2 correspond to the actual consumption in the absence of DR events. We collected power consumption data for five weekdays and two weekends to compute the average power consumption, as detailed in Eq. (1): (1) P B L ( t ) = ∑ i N P T C L , i ( t ) · s i ( t ) N where P B L ( t ) is the baseline power load without external control signals calculated using the historical data at the time t, with the unit of W; P T C L , i ( t ) is the power consumption for ith TCL at the time t, with the unit of W; s i ( t ) is the current status of ith TCL at the time t; N is the population of the TCLs. However, due to weather conditions and occupancy variations, the baseline needs to be adjusted to reflect the recently observed demand [26]. In this study, the baseline adjustment factor a a is defined as an additive power consumption adjustment, and its calculation is performed as indicated in Eq. (2). (2) P a ( t ) = ∑ 0 T P B L ( t ) − ∑ 0 T C ( t ) T where T represents the adjustment period before the DR event; and C represents the power energy consumption in the adjustment period at time t, with the unit of W. It is important to note that the adjustment period refers to the data concerning the period before event notification, rather than the period before the event starts. Considering that the demand response events are scheduled at 1 p.m. on weekends and 3 p.m. on weekdays, the 3-h power consumption data is calculated starting at 9 a.m. on weekdays and 11 a.m. on weekends for the purpose of making adjustments. After adjusting the P B L value, as indicated in Eq. (3) for an additive adjustment, the adjusted baseline load P A B L for the DR event is obtained as in Eq. (3). (3) P A B L ( t ) = P B L ( t ) + P a ( t ) 2.2.3 DR tracking target Once the adjusted power baseline is established, the load shedding goal for the demand response (DR) events must be defined. In this study, we consult existing literature and collaborate with energy providers to establish the tracking goal. The tracking target P t a r g e t is set at a 20 % reduction in power consumption compared to the baseline, as illustrated in Fig. 1 with an orange dotted line. (4) P t a r g e t ( t ) = P A B L ( t ) × 80 % 2.3 Hardware configuration A cloud deployment and hardware configuration framework has been developed for the PSBC strategies. The hardware architecture is depicted in Fig. 3 . It is divided into three levels: coordinator level, data level, and TCLs level. The primary hardware component is the iBUILDING platform [27], capable of collecting data from smart meters and sensors while remotely controlling each indoor unit. The PSBC controller, strategically designed and implemented at the coordinator level, receives real-time data regarding indoor temperature and power consumption. It optimizes the operation of indoor units and utilizes the iBUILDING platform to transmit optimized control actions to each indoor unit. We collect information on the operation status, power consumption of indoor and outdoor units, and indoor environmental data at the data and TCLs levels. Data sourced from the VRF and building systems are meticulously gathered and recorded in the InfluxDB database [28]. The dataset comprises 5-min time series of the variables listed in Table 1 . The centralized server automatically formulates and resolves the necessary optimization problems for each control optimization within a Python environment. The server receives data collected by sensors from the room and indoor unit, storing it in the project database for subsequent utilization by the PSBC algorithms. 2.4 Priority stack-based control Priority stacked-based control strategy was first proposed by Lu and Zhang [16] and Hao et al. [17,29] for TCLs control. In this method, the aggregator compares the power target P t a r g e t with the instantaneous aggregate power P a g g (given by Eq. (5)) by the TCLs at each sample time. (5) P a g g ( t ) = ∑ i = 1 j P T C L , i ( t ) · s i ( t ) Then, TCLs are grouped based on their states and temperature at the previous time steps, namely the OFF state (denoted by x 1 , x 2 , ⋯ , x i ) and ON state (denoted by x i + 1 , x i + 2 , ⋯ , x n ). When the state-space model is employed to express the aggregated operation of the TCLs, the vector x defines the states of the TCLs, defined by: (6) { s i , t O N = X { s i = O N , T z = k } s i , t O F F = X { s i = O F F , T z = k } where T z is the current temperature that the TCL is at time t. The vector representation of the state is then: (7) S t = [ s 1 , t O F F , \u2026 , s i , t O F F , s i + 1 , t O N , \u2026 , s n , t O N ] TCLs in each group are organized based on temperature difference. Priority lists and target power consumption guide the switching operations for specific TCLs. Suppose at time t we have P t a r g e t ( t ) < P a g g ( t ) , and the TCL population must reduce power consumption and discharge power to the grid. Consequently, some units that are ON need to be switched OFF. The units that are about to switch off should be turned off as soon as possible. The temperature distance to the lower temperature bound, ordered by π ( t ) = T z ( t ) − T z l , is a natural way to quantify imminence. It is most appropriate to turn OFF those units that will most imminently turn OFF. Imminence can be measured naturally by temperature distance to the lower temperature bound. Consequently, we can construct the OFF priority stack consisting of units that are ON. The TCLs in this stack are ordered by their priority criterion. Similarly, if P t a r g e t ( t ) > P a g g ( t ) , more electricity is required by the TCL population, and some units that are OFF need to be switched ON. We can develop the ON priority stack of OFF units, arranged by π ( t ) = T z u − T z ( t ) . TCLs in the OFF stack that are closest to the upper bound are more likely to be turned on. Using temperature distance, the manipulable units in the OFF stack are indexed from top to bottom, and the manipulable units in the ON stack are indexed from bottom to top. Prioritized units will be the first to be turned ON/OFF, followed by units with lower priorities, and so on, until their actual power consumption equals the difference between the aggregate power and the regulation signal, as shown in Eq. (8). By avoiding short-cycling and reducing wear and tear on mechanical equipment, this priority-stack-based control technique minimizes the ON/OFF switching action for each unit. The pseudo code of the vanilla PSBC is shown in Algorithm 1. (8) { j * = m i n { j ∑ i = 1 j P T C L , i ( t ) ≥ P t a r g e t ( t ) − P a g g ( t ) } j * = min { j ∑ i = 1 j P T C L , i ( t ) ≥ P a g g ( t ) − P t a r g e t ( t ) } Algorithm 1 The vanilla PSBC (Strategy S1) Image 1 In the vanilla PSBC strategy, the control performs three main tasks at each step: precooling, power consumption signal tracking, and thermal comfort overriding. Precooling commences 1 h before the DR event to involve more TCLs. During the precooling operation, the setpoint is held constant at 24 °C. Signal tracking initiates by categorizing TCLs into two stacks based on their state: H o n for ON units that can be turned off, and H o f f for OFF units that can be turned on. The signal tracking operation follows the regulation signal by switching HVAC units using the temperature priority-based principle. Additionally, the setpoint for each TCL remains constant at 25 °C. Once this operation concludes, the aggregated power consumption should match the tracking power target, assuming there are enough switchable TCLs. Subsequently, the thermal comfort overriding operation addresses temperature requirements by checking for buildings with undesirable temperatures and acting accordingly, denoted by: (9) s i ( t ) = { 1 i f T z ( t ) > T z u 0 i f T z ( t ) < T z l s i ( t − 1 ) o t h e r w i s e Additionally, to prevent short cycling of the HVAC units, the algorithm enforces a minimum 0.5 °C temperature difference between the current temperature measurement and the temperature bounds. The entire control process is applied with a control time step of 5 min. It is crucial to noted that, in the context of thermal comfort requirements within the S1 strategy, TCLs failing to meet comfort levels are turned back ON/OFF, introducing potential difficulties in ensuring tracking performance. To mitigate this challenge, we extend the vanilla PSBC by incorporating a tracking target modified mechanism. This mechanism initially switches ON/OFF TCLs not meeting comfort requirements and subsequently adjusts the tracking power consumption. The tracking target modified mechanism plays a vital role in meeting tracking requirements while preserving thermal comfort. The pseudo code is presented in Algorithm 2. Algorithm 2 The modified PSBC (Strategy S2) Image 2 The S2 control strategy comprises two stages: precooling and power consumption signal tracking. Diverging from the S1 control strategy, the precooling setpoint is determined by the PLR during the adjusted period. If the PLR exceeds 50 %, the precooling setpoint is established at 24 °C; otherwise, it remains constant at 24.5 °C, as depicted in Eqs. (10) and (11). (10) T p r e c o o l i n g , s p = { 24.5 i f P L R < 50 % 24 i f P L R > 50 % (11) P L R = ∑ 0 T C ( t ) ∑ 0 T P B L ( t ) × 100 % During the power consumption signal tracking operation, it initially turns on TCLs with temperatures above the upper bounds, and turn off TCLs with temperatures below the lower bounds. To maintain tracking performance, the power consumption tracking signal is adjusted based on the power consumption of TCLs that do not meet thermal comfort requirements. Thus, the revised tracking power is calculated as follows: (12) { P t a r g e t \u2032 ( t ) = P t a r g e t ( t ) − ∑ i = 1 j P T C L , i ( t ) P t a r g e t \u2032 ( t ) = P t a r g e t ( t ) + ∑ i = 1 j P T C L , i ( t ) Subsequently, the remaining TCLs are segregated into ON and OFF stacks and managed in a manner similar to the vanilla control strategy. The setpoint for each TCL also remains at 25 °C. Like the vanilla strategy, the modified strategy also operates on a 5-min control step. Moreover, a primary research question addressed in this study involves exploring the tracking performance when the ON/OFF control is substituted with temperature setpoint control. Consequently, for the temperature setpoint control, we transmitted a low temperature setpoint (24 °C) when the indoor unit should be ON and a high temperature setpoint (26 °C) when the indoor unit should be OFF, and compared the performance with direct ON/OFF control, as illustrated by: (14) T s p ( t ) = { 24 i f T z ( t ) > T z u 26 i f T z ( t ) < T z l T s p ( t − 1 ) o t h e r w i s e 2.5 Performance metrics To evaluate the performance of different control strategies, three metrics during a given DR event are calculated, including SPI, CVRMSE and discomfort [30,31]. The SPI and CVRMSE indicators are expressed as shown in Eqs. (15) and (16). (15) S P I = Δ P a c t u a l , D R Δ P e x p e c t e d , A B L (16) C V R M S E = 1 T ∫ 0 T ( P t a r g e t ( t ) − P a g g ( t ) ) 2 d t P a g g × 100 % where Δ P e x p e c t e d , A B L is the expected mean power consumption reduction that was the difference between the adjusted baseline and tracking target, with the unit of W; Δ P a c t u a l , D R is the achieved power consumption reduction between the adjusted baseline and actual power consumption during a DR event, with the unit of W; P p e a k , A B L is the peak power consumption with the unit of W. When SPI approaches 1, it signifies that the actual power consumption reduction aligns with the expected power reduction during the DR period. Moreover, a smaller CVRMSE value signifies better tracking performance and higher tracking accuracy. Apart from monitoring power consumption, our attention extends to zone-specific thermal comfort. The discomfort for each zone during the testing period, denoted as D d , is computed as the integral of the temperature deviation from the comfort band ( T z u and T z l ), as illustrated in the equation below: (17) D d = ∑ i = 1 N ( ∫ t 0 t f ( max ( T z l − T i , z , 0 ) + max ( T i , z − T z u , 0 ) ) d t ) N × ( t f − t 0 ) where T z u and T z l represent the upper and lower bounds of thermal comfort, respectively, with the unit of °C; for this study, the upper and lower constraints on zone temperature are set at 26 °C and 24 °C, respectively; T z denotes the actual zone temperature, with the unit of °C. 3 Results 3.1 Comparison of the different control strategies The tracking performance of the S1 and S2 strategies, utilizing both direct ON/OFF switching control and temperature setpoints, is illustrated in Fig. 4 . It is evident from the figure that SPI values for the S1 strategy exhibit more fluctuations, whereas those for the S2 strategy are relatively stable, with an average value close to 1. After calculation, the average SPI values for S1 and S2 are 1.32 and 0.98, respectively. The average CVRMSE values for the two strategies, S1 and S2, are 33.4 % and 27.4 %, respectively. The tracking accuracy has improved by 17.9 %. This indicates that the S2 strategy outperforms the S1 strategy in terms of tracking performance. Additionally, it is noteworthy that SPI values perform better, but CVRMSE values perform worse under the temperature setpoint, as depicted in Fig. 4. In comparison with direct ON/OFF control, the average SPI decreases by 19 %, and the average CVRMSE increases by 30.7 % Fig. 5 illustrates the thermal discomfort concerning the daily average targeted power consumption in different periods, encompassing the precooling period, DR period, and the remaining periods. It's crucial to note that the discomfort during the remaining periods is calculated based on indoor units switching on between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m., excluding the precooling and DR periods. The discomfort increases with a higher average targeted power consumption for both strategies S1 and S2, as a higher targeted power consumption indicates a greater cooling demand. Moreover, the thermal discomfort during the precooling period is nearly higher for both S1 and S2 strategies compared to the other two periods. This outcome stems from a reduction in the setpoint temperature during the precooling period. Nevertheless, the average discomforts in the precooling period for the S2 strategy is 0.18 °C, which is lower than that of the S1 strategy at 0.34 °C. This enhancement is credited to the dynamic adjustment of setpoints in the S2 strategy based on the part-load ratio. Regarding the DR period, the average discomforts are 0.18 °C for S1 and 0.11 °C for S2, signifying a 38.8 % improvement. Additionally, these percentages closely align with discomfort levels observed in the remaining periods, confirming that the PSBC control strategies do not compromise indoor thermal comfort. 3.2 Control performance of ON/OFF control To figure out why the tracking performance of the S2 strategy outperforms that of the S1 strategy, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the power consumption and indoor temperature at each control step of the S1 and S2 strategies. Figs. 6 and 7 illustrate the detailed power consumption of indoor units and resulting indoor temperature variations with S1 and S2 strategies during two representative days with similar adjusted power baselines and power consumption targets for the DR events. With the primary objective of the proposed strategies being to track the target power consumption during the DR event, it is crucial that the total power consumption remains relatively stable. The actual power consumption using the S2 strategy is more stable and exhibits better tracking performance than that of strategy S1, as illustrated in Figs. 6(a) and Fig. 7(a). The CVRMSE for the S1 and S2 strategies is 48.7 % and 19.6 %, respectively. This difference is attributed to the S1 strategy overriding the ON/OFF action of those TCLs that do not satisfy thermal comfort, as seen in Fig. 5(c). These TCLs lead to a drastic variation in power consumption during the DR event. In contrast, the S2 strategy takes into account revising the tracking power consumption when it switches ON/OFF the indoor units that do not meet the thermal comfort requirements before performing ON/OFF switching control. Therefore, the power consumption variations are smoothed, and tracking performance is better when controlled with the S2 strategy. Similar to other control strategies, maintaining zone temperatures within comfort boundaries is imperative. It is evident that the thermal comfort in both the S1 and S2 strategies is maintained within the range of 24 °C\u201326 °C. As a result, both strategies can reduce power consumption while minimizing the duration during which controlled zones deviate from the thermal comfort boundary. Significantly, in Fig. 5(b), nearly all zone temperatures exhibit a gradual increase from levels below 24 °C at the onset. This can be attributed to the lower constant precooling setpoint, causing most zone temperatures to dip below 24 °C. Consequently, there is a necessity to turn off numerous indoor units at the commencement of the DR event. Conversely, this phenomenon exhibits reduced prominence in the S2 strategy owing to its dynamic precooling setpoint control strategy. 3.3 Control performance of setpoint control To explore the superior performance of SPI and the inferior performance of CVRMSE under temperature control, we select two representative days for analyzing the tracking performance of the S1 and S2 strategies using temperature setpoint control. The results are illustrated in Figs. 8 and 9 . These two selected representative days also share similarities in adjusted power baselines and power consumption targets for the DR events. Figs. 7(a) and 8(a) depict large fluctuations in actual power consumption, resulting in poorer tracking performance following the DR event. The CVRMSE values for the S1 and S2 strategies are 45.8 % and 37.5 %, respectively. It is important to note that unexpected power oscillations occur in the temperature setpoint control of the S1 and S2 strategies, resulting in higher peaks and large uncontrolled swings in aggregate load. This observation aligns with findings from previous studies [32]. To further investigate the main causes, we extend this part in the discussions. Regarding the indoor temperature variation of each TCL, Figs. 7(b) and 8(b) illustrate that the room temperature remains within the comfort range for most of the DR event. Additionally, it is observed that the zone temperature also exhibits temperature oscillations. This phenomenon is attributed to the simultaneous initiation and cessation of cooling by most TCLs. 4 Discussion 4.1 Power oscillation analysis To further investigate the main causes of power oscillation behavior, we analyze the operational parameters of VRF systems on two selected representative days. This analysis encompasses factors such as temperature difference, valve opening, and compressor frequencies. The phenomenon of identical start and stop sequences of indoor units is more evident, serving as the direct source of power oscillation behavior, as depicted in Fig. 10 . Compared to the management of ON/OFF control, temperature setpoint control exhibited a more substantial variation in the number of switched-on indoor units, ranging from 5 to 100. We further analyzed the causes of the identical start and stop phenomenon observed in TCLs. The temperature differences between the setpoint and the indoor temperature for TCLs are displayed in Fig. 11 . Each dot in Fig. 11(a) represents the average temperature difference for a TCL during the DR event, while Fig. 11(b) illustrates the temperature difference distributions of all TCLs during the DR event. It can be observed that the temperature difference of setpoint control ranges between 0.5 °C and 2.5 °C, whereas the temperature difference of ON/OFF control ranges between −0.5 °C and 0.5 °C. Fig. 11(b) highlights a 1 °C higher temperature difference in setpoint control compared to ON/OFF control. This difference is a result of the distinct temperature setpoints in ON/OFF control and temperature setpoint control. In ON/OFF control, the setpoint remains constant at 25 °C, leading to smaller temperature differences. The valve opening of a TCL is further discussed and illustrated in Fig. 12 . The black dotted line represents the operational status of the same TCL under ON/OFF control and temperature setpoint control, while the solid blue line depicts the changes in valve opening. The graph illustrates that the valve opening for ON/OFF switching control is limited to a maximum of 140, whereas for temperature setpoint control, it reaches up to 160. The primary cause of this difference is the larger temperature difference in temperature setpoint control, leading to increased cooling demand and refrigerant flow rate for the TCL. Consequently, the valve opening for the TCL becomes larger. Moreover, the higher refrigerant flow rate accelerates the zone temperature decrease. As a result, the zone temperatures in Figs. 7(a) and 8(a), as well as the ON/OFF switching trends for TCLs, are more likely to demonstrate similar patterns. The higher cooling demand and increased refrigerant flow rates of the TCLs result in an elevation of the frequencies of the compressors in the outdoor unit, as illustrated in Fig. 13 . In the case of compressor 1, the compressor frequency exhibits more pronounced variations under temperature setpoint control and more continuous changes under ON/OFF control. The peak compressor frequency is higher with setpoint control than with ON/OFF control during the DR event. For compressor 2, it turns on when the compressor cannot meet the cooling load demand. From Fig. 13(b), it can be clearly observed that compressor 2 turns on more frequently when temperature setpoint control is used. This is also caused by the large temperature difference of the indoor unit and high cooling demands. Simultaneously, the trends of compressor frequencies are similar for different outdoor units, resulting from the similar ON/OFF switching trends for TCLs. Consequently, large fluctuations in actual power consumption occur during the DR event. In summary, the large temperature difference associated with temperature setpoint control results in increased cooling demand and consistent trends in zone temperature. Consequently, there are significant variations and resemblances in compressor frequency trends. Ultimately, the application of temperature setpoint control precipitates the emergence of unexpected power oscillation behavior. To further substantiate the hypothesis that the temperature difference is the primary cause of the power oscillation behavior, we conducted additional tests using a different setpoint of 24.5 °C/25.5 °C in the field. Fig. 14 illustrates the control performance with this adjusted setpoint. Remarkably, a significant enhancement in the power oscillation behavior was observed. This improvement is ascribed to the reduced temperature difference between the setpoint and the indoor temperature, resulting in a diminished cooling demand and less consistent indoor temperature fluctuations. Concurrently, the indoor temperature is better maintained within the comfort zone at this setpoint temperature, as depicted in the second subgraph of Fig. 14. 4.2 Contributions This study makes the following contributions to the existing literature: 1. Brought PSBC in real buildings for demand response: We present an innovative hardware and software framework designed to implement PSBC in real buildings for DR. This framework aims to effectively coordinate multiple TCLs during DR events. Leveraging cloud deployment and hardware configuration based on the iBUILDING platform, the framework is strategically developed to maintain indoor temperatures within the comfort range both during and before DR events. 2. Evaluated a modified PSBC strategy in a real office building: We assessed the control performance and discomfort hours of the vanilla (S1) and modified PSBC (S2) strategies through a 22-day field test conducted in an office building. The results reveal that the average SPI values for strategies S1 and S2 are 1.32 and 0.98, respectively. Additionally, the average CVRMSE for load tracking errors in strategies S1 and S2 is 33.4 % and 27.4 %, respectively, signifying a notable 17.9 % improvement in tracking accuracy. During the DR event, the average discomforts are 0.18 °C for S1 and 0.11 °C for S2, representing a significant improvement of 38.8 %. Noteworthy is the superior performance of strategy S2 over S1 in terms of tracking accuracy and thermal comfort, suggesting its enhanced capability to assist the power grid in more effectively managing HVAC loads. 3. Analyzed unexpected power oscillation behavior: We conducted a thorough investigation into the main causes of unexpected power oscillation behavior observed during temperature setpoint adjustment control. Our analysis reveals that the underlying cause of this behavior is a larger temperature difference between the setpoint and the indoor temperature. Additionally, we observed that reducing this temperature difference can effectively alleviate the occurrence of power oscillation behavior. 4.3 Limitations and future work While this study successfully implemented the vanilla and modified PSBC strategies in an office environment and assessed their control performance through field tests, there are several limitations that should be addressed: 1. Limited evaluation period: One limitation is that the performance of the proposed PSBC strategies was only evaluated for 22 days. To obtain a more comprehensive understanding of the effects of the PSBC strategies in practical applications, it would be beneficial to conduct experiments throughout the entire cooling season, enabling a more thorough analysis of the long-term performance and effectiveness of the PSBC strategies. 2. The number of controlled TCLs: While this study utilized 110 TCLs to assess the control performance of the PSBC strategy, it is imperative to conduct further quantitative analysis with larger sample sizes. Increasing the sample size could provide a more comprehensive understanding of how the PSBC strategy performs when operating with a larger number of TCLs. 3. Addressing power oscillation: The study identifies power oscillation behavior and analyzes its main causes. However, it does not propose a solution to overcome power oscillation or improve tracking performance. Therefore, further research is needed to develop strategies that can mitigate power oscillation and minimize large uncontrolled swings in aggregate load, which is crucial for maintaining grid stability and safety. 5 Conclusions Priority stack-based control (PSBC) has demonstrated its effectiveness in reducing peak loads and tracking target loads during demand response (DR) events. However, despite the growing number of PSBC applications in building energy systems, there is a lack of studies that apply PSBC strategies in real buildings and analyze their control performance. In this study, we introduce a comprehensive framework for orchestrating 110 thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs) in response to demand response (DR) signals. Our investigation involves a comparative analysis between the vanilla PSBC strategy (S1) and the proposed modified PSBC strategy (S2) concerning tracking performance and thermal comfort. We highlight the effectiveness of the proposed PSBC strategy in coordinating the ON/OFF switching control of TCLs, ensuring the tracking of target loads while maintaining optimal comfort levels. To streamline the implementation of these strategies, we design a cloud deployment and hardware configuration framework based on the iBUILDING platform. The performance evaluation of the proposed PSBC strategies undergoes rigorous testing in an office building situated in Foshan, China, over a 22-day period. Based on the results obtained from the field tests, the SPI values for strategies S1 and S2 are 1.32 and 0.98, respectively. Additionally, the CVRMSE values for strategies S1 and S2 are 33.4 % and 27.4 %, respectively, indicating a 17.9 % improvement in tracking accuracy. The discomforts during the DR event are 0.18 °C for S1 and 0.11 °C for S2, representing an improvement of 38.8 %. Notably, S2 outperforms S1 in both tracking performance and thermal comfort, indicating its superior performance. Last, we compare two TCL control strategies: ON/OFF control and temperature setpoint adjustment. We conducted tests to evaluate the performance of these strategies, and the results indicate a preference for ON/OFF control. Temperature setpoint adjustment has a higher likelihood of causing power oscillation behavior, attributed to the larger temperature difference between the setpoint and the actual indoor temperature in temperature setpoint control. Consequently, more aggressive control actions, such as larger valve openings and increased cooling capacity, are triggered, resulting in more significant temperature fluctuations. These fluctuations are undesirable for maintaining thermal comfort. CRediT authorship contribution statement Dan Wang: Writing \u2013 original draft, Visualization, Validation, Software.

        "dc:description": "Global energy consumption for space heating and cooling is significant, referred to as thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs). Due to the large thermal mass of buildings, TCLs are increasingly utilized in demand response (DR) events to balance electricity supply and demand. Priority Stack-Based Control (PSBC) is a common strategy for coordinating TCLs, showing potential in reducing peak loads and shifting TCL loads. However, there are limited studies that have demonstrated and evaluated the performance of PSBC in real-world settings. Additionally, PSBC lacks an effective mechanism to simultaneously ensure tracking performance and thermal comfort. This study developed and tested vanilla and modified PSBC strategies for reducing TCL loads during DR events. A framework for deploying these strategies is proposed, involving cloud-based implementation and hardware configuration. The vanilla and modified PSBC strategies was evaluated through a 22-day field test in a real office building, in terms of load tracking and thermal comfort. The results demonstrate that the modified strategy shows better control performance, evidenced by improvements in the subscribed performance index (SPI), coefficient of variation of root mean square error (CVRMSE) for load tracking, and thermal comfort. Additionally, the control performance is investigated when direct ON/OFF switching control is replaced by indoor temperature setpoint adjustment. Unexpected power oscillation behavior occurs with significant temperature differences between the setpoint and the indoor temperature. Our work provides practical evaluations that quantify PSBC control performance and presents a compelling case for the feasibility of PSBC as a method for reducing peak demand in commercial buildings.",
