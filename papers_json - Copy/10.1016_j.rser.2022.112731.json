Signal Metric Description Advantage Limitations RSSI It indicates the strength of a signal at the receiver. Signal attenuation depends on the distance between transmitter and receiver and described using logarithmic path loss models Provides median accuracy with low hardware and computational cost. Susceptible to shadowing and reflection from obstructions. Varies with atmospheric temperature and humidity. Merely represents sum of the amplitude of all signal components and is less granular. CSI It represents the state of a communication link and includes the effects of scattering, fading and signal attenuation. In WiFi, for example CSI signifies the amplitude and phase of individual OFDM subcarrier. Represents fine-grained channel information. Especially useful in device-free localization with reported accuracies less than a meter. Extraction of CSI requires specialized software tools. ToA The signal propagation time multiplied with velocity can directly give a estimate of transmitter\u2013receiver separation. Can provide accurate estimates under line of sight conditions. Requires time synchronization between transmitter and receiver. Signal bandwidth and sampling rate affects accuracy. RToF A two-way propagation scheme is employed-from transmitter to receiver and then back to the transmitter. For a known measurement delay at the receiver, RToF is half the difference between round trip time and measurement delay. Relaxes the time synchronization requirements in ToA. Only local time needs to be known. Vulnerable to clock drifts. TDoA The location of receiver can be computed by measuring the difference in signal arrival time from multiple transmitter or vice versa (multiple receivers and a single transmitter). Synchronization between transmitter and receiver not required Tight synchronization necessary between transmitters. Also TDoA estimation is computationally intensive. AoA The direction of a transmitter can be estimated by quantifying the time difference of arrival or phase of arrival of the signal at antenna arrays. With these known measurement angles, target location can be calculated through triangulation. Accuracies up to a few degrees is possible Requires complex and expensive hardware. Accuracy worsens as the distance between transmitter and receiver increases. PoA Antenna arrays can be used to estimate the phase of an incoming signal or phase difference between array elements. May be used in association with RSSI, ToA or TDoA to improve the location estimates. Affected by obstacles in the propagation path. Table 4 Summary of occupancy detection schemes using RFID.

Challenge Possible solution Sparsity in the number of access points Efficient fusion algorithms may be designed, that combine wireless signal parameters such as RSSI/CSI with other sensor data, for example from smart phones. Signal processing techniques employed must be robust enough to mitigate the effects of signal fading in through-the-wall scenarios, as only a single WiFi router maybe available in home environments. Predictability and dwell time Predictability can be improved by using historical occupancy information. If a predefined dwell time is not satisfied by the user, appliances may be switched to a power down mode temporarily, rather than completely turning them off or on, for example, dimming of lights. Need for standard protocols for HEMS The layered architecture of the home gateway must include adequate features that facilitate the inclusion of heterogeneous devices. IoT protocols such as MQTT is a good choice for reporting the status of appliances and occupants to the cloud. Adoption of such techniques by the public PIR sensors, traditionally used for motion sensing offers a low cost solution, but with its own set of limitations. Opportunistic sensing modalities such as WiFi based sensing, smart phones and smart energy meters could be adopted in such cases. Also government policies may be revised to incorporate energy efficient schemes during residential building construction. Vulnerability to power failures A standard HEMS design must ensure the availability of renewable energy sources such as solar panels to meet the energy demand during peak load hours or power shutdowns. Intelligent appliance scheduling, especially during peak load hours can help to reduce power fluctuations. Data collection Crowd sourcing can greatly reduce the burden of training database construction. Appropriate mobile applications maybe developed to augment data collection and labelling of ground truth data. Sensor deployment and maintenance cost Existing IoT infrastructure such as WiFi routers, smartphones and laptops maybe used for ambient sensing. Low cost IoT devices such as ESP32 have immense sensing and connectivity potential. The optimal number and position of sensors must be planned at the design phase itself, so that their installation cost can be cut down. Accuracy and user comfort The occupancy monitoring model must incorporate fail safe techniques so that the accuracy is not compromised. For example including historical occupancy/appliance usage data in the model can aid the detection system in case of sensor failures during real time operation. This can also be used for comparing the predictions made by the model and help to reduce false positives. In case of space heating/cooling, geofencing can be used for turning on the HVAC equipments prior to occupant re-entry, easing their comfort level. User comfort can also be improved by using passive sensing rather than wearable sensors. Effect of environmental conditions Based on the sensing modality, appropriate signal preprocessing must be carried out to alleviate environmental noise. For example, in case of wireless signals a variety of low pass filters are available in literature for noise removal. In case of smart phone inertial sensors, sensor calibration and offset removal maybe considered during preprocessing. Energy efficiency and battery life Sudden turning on of HVAC equipments on occupant re-entry can reduce energy efficiency and potential savings. Geofencing and dwell time can be taken into account for graceful on/off operation. A thorough investigation of the effect of sensor sampling rate on the system accuracy is necessary during design phase. Finding an optimal sampling rate helps to improve the battery life of sensors. Complex models, such as those which use deep learning models, are computationally expensive, although they offer accurate predictions. Hence their resource utilization must be well studied before real time implementation. Device heterogeneity and WiFi sleep policy The gateway maybe designed to send beacon requests to all connected devices to report their status at periodic time intervals Data security Blockchain technology may be integrated in IoT enabled HEMS so as to make secure data and energy transfers through smart contracts.

Smart scheduling of domestic appliances based on user demand is an important aspect of any home energy management system. Such a demand driven operation can be performed only by accurately detecting the presence and the location of users in their residence. IoT and other enabling technologies can transform a smart home into an energy aware entity by judicious utilization of the available data. This paper presents a survey of various occupancy detection and localization schemes and evaluates them on the basis of various factors that decide their suitability for home energy management system. Wireless technologies have been historically employed for detecting unknown targets in indoor environments. The pervasiveness of WiFi access points in urban buildings render it as a preferred candidate for occupancy detection and localization. Design of device-free sensing techniques, using commercially available WiFi routers can offer an affordable solution with minimum disturbance to the inhabitants. Detection accuracy maybe enhanced by combining wireless techniques with smartphone inertial sensors and other passive detection schemes that utilize smart energy meters or environmental sensors. In contrast to commercial buildings, several challenges must be addressed for occupancy detection in home energy management system. The impact of these design challenges are investigated and feasible solutions are suggested. Keywords Home energy management system Internet of Things Occupancy detection Localization Data availability Data will be made available on request. 1 Introduction With the world population reaching 7.9 billion in 2021, power hungry equipments and devices are extensively being used in industrial and residential sectors. According to the statistics from International Energy Agency, the world electricity consumption reached 22315 TWh in 2018. Comparing sector-wise consumption, the residential sector contributed to 26.92% of the total utilization, as shown in Fig. 1 [1]. The domestic electricity consumption in developing countries like India has quadrupled over the past two decades. Indian households accounted for an estimated 24.01% of the country\u2019s total electricity utilization during 2019\u20132020 financial year [2]. Spurred by higher standards of living and faster economic growth, this percentage is much higher in developed countries. For example in 2017, the residential sector in United States of America held 36.57% share of the country\u2019s total electricity consumption [2]. At the same time, reservoirs of combustible fuels like coal, oil and natural gas, which account for 66.3% of the gross electricity production [1], are dwindling. Thus energy has become a scarce resource in today\u2019s world. This has forced international agencies to adopt energy efficient policies in all facets of life. During the COVID-19 crisis, the lockdown imposed by governments around the globe has forced people to stay at home for a major part of 2020. This has led to increased residential electricity consumption, as schools and offices have been closed and working from home was the only solution. Increased daytime occupancy during COVID-19 lockdown has resulted in a 30% rise in the US domestic sector electricity consumption [3]. A study conducted among 7000 dwellings in Warsaw, Poland, cites that the active energy consumption during the lockdown period between March 2020 to April 2020 has seen a rise of 16% compared to the same period in 2018 [4]. Similar surveys were conducted in Australia [5] and Spain [6]. Such studies recommend the need for implementing low cost and efficient smart home technology, with the objective of minimizing energy expenditure [7]. 1.1 IoT based home energy management system Home energy management systems (HEMS) have attracted considerable research from industrial and corporate companies like Google, Cisco Systems Inc., Intel Corporation, General Electric etc. New technological paradigms like IoT, cloud computing, machine learning and Big Data have added further momentum to these developments by the incorporation of additional attributes. Rather than mere automation, user comfort, safety and security features can also be added to these systems. HEMS allows for remote monitoring and scheduling of household appliances so that electricity consumption may be reduced, especially during peak load hours. Such scheduling maybe based on user behaviour and appliance usage pattern collected over a period of time, real-time occupancy or activity sensing, weather forecasts or even direct user input [9\u201312]. HEMS can also give rewards to the user based on demand response (DR) models, supply details about tariffs, daily and monthly power consumption figures. Recommendations can also be given to the consumers so as to bring about changes in his/her electricity usage patterns [13]. HEMS can reduce energy wastage by switching off standby loads like televisions, set top boxes and idle desktops by accurately studying the duration of a user\u2019s presence in a room [14]. The operating period of heavy loads such as air conditioners and heaters can be shortened by modulating their set points. HEMS can also enable switching to renewable energy storage at appropriate times. Surplus electricity generated from residential complexes could also be transferred back to the power grid [15]. Hence, the readiness of a user to accept such suggestions and modify his routine energy consumption behaviour goes a long way in the success of this system. Fig. 2 shows the representation of an IoT based smart home which contains the following levels [13,16,17]: 1. A smart home equipped with the following entities: \u2022 Smart appliances that are embedded with internet connection. \u2022 Smart meters which have bidirectional communication and remote reading capability. \u2022 Building automation systems includes various sensors, actuators and interfaces along with associated network protocols. \u2022 Renewable energy sources like solar panels installed on rooftops or wind turbines. \u2022 Energy storage to store the energy produced by renewable sources present at the site. \u2022 Security system to ensure user authentication. 2. A home gateway acts as the networking hub to which all the IoT devices in the smart home can communicate with. It also provides a communication link between the home and public network. 3. The cloud forms the central part of modern energy management systems as it has enormous storage and computational capabilities. 4. Utility includes production, transmission and distribution parts of the power grid. It can communicate data related to tariffs, weather forecasts, transmission line status, peak load periods etc. to the cloud. 5. Third party application developers obtain data from the cloud and deliver web based solutions or mobile applications. 6. User interfaces provide data to users in the form of notifications, recommendations and smart appliance control and monitoring through sophisticated visualization tools. Emerging IoT technologies like SigFox, LoRaWAN and IEEE 802.11ah can facilitate low power extended range applications for seamless connectivity between IoT devices. Such technologies can assist smart homes in making easy and secure data transfers with the smart grid. For example, the work done in [18] uses light weight IoT communication protocols like MQTT (Message Queueing Telemetry Transport Protocol) to transmit ambient temperature, humidity and power consumption data of HVAC units to a middle ware software module. This system consists of several servers that store and analyse the sensed data with the help of business intelligence platforms. The analytics engine supplies electricity consumption and billing reports, device status, bill payment and remote controlling provisions through a cross platform mobile user interface. The system also has a benchmarking feature that help users to compare their electricity consumption data with others and thereby help in reforming their energy usage pattern. In [19], energy saving recommendations were generated for smart homes using rule based languages like RuleML and users were classified based on energy utilization statistics. Thus, the plethora of IoT enabled services for home energy management are endless and have tremendous scope in energy saving for the nation. 1.2 Key contributions Accurate and real time occupancy sensing along with user localization is necessary for demand driven load scheduling in a home environment. This paper presents a review of various occupancy detection and target positioning approaches which are pertinent for a resource constrained residential setting. Most of the existing reviews on indoor occupancy detection and localization provide exhaustive description of methodologies which are applicable to resource-rich commercial buildings [20\u201326]. The existing building management systems present in these structures exhibit easy scalability and adaptability to newer technologies like IoT. But transforming residential buildings to smart entities is a strenuous and challenging task and hence requires collaboration of all stakeholders. The key contributions of this paper are: 1. The paper provides a comprehensive survey of indoor occupancy detection and localization schemes which are well suited and presumed to have good acceptability for an IoT enabled HEMS. 2. Relevant research papers published between 2010 and 2021 are reviewed and their important features tabulated. The advantages and shortcomings of each approach is highlighted. Curves plotted using publicly available datasets and real-time data collected from a typical home environment are also included for clarity. 3. An assessment framework based on various criteria that decide the acceptance of these systems for HEMS is presented. 4. Also the specific challenges that any researcher encounters while designing an occupancy detection system for a home environment are listed out and potential solutions are suggested. The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 highlights the necessity of occupancy detection and a taxonomy of the available techniques. Sections 3 and 4 introduces various occupancy sensing and localization methods. A detailed description of different radio-based and passive detection schemes which are particularly suitable for residential buildings is presented. In Section 5, their characteristics are evaluated on the basis of various criteria that determine their cost and acceptability. Section 6 enumerates the issues that need to be addressed for occupancy detection system design for a home setting and gives suggestions for overcoming them. The paper is concluded in Section 7. 2 Occupancy detection and localization techniques for energy conservation 2.1 Need for occupancy sensing and geofencing Indoor localization plays a key role in the design of smart homes as it unveils the occupancy information of its residents. This data can be used to create services such as health monitoring (heart beat, respiration rate, sleep apnea and fall detection) of the elderly, gesture recognition (human activity, keystroke, sign language and lip motion recognition) for energy management, contextual information acquisition and authentication for access control, intrusion and abnormality detection [27]. Sensing the position of a user either in a coarse (room-level) or fine-grained (exact location) format maybe used to deliver location and proximity based services for smart homes. For example, if the user is lying on his bed, the air conditioner maybe turned on and lights off. If he is sitting on his couch, the television and fans maybe turned on and light intensity could be adjusted according to user preference and ambient light. Similarly if he is walking from one room to the other, unused devices could be automatically turned off. All these are examples of micro-location where the target location has to be estimated accurately. On the other hand, as a user approaches the vicinity of his house, a virtual fence maybe be created around the HEMS so that smart appliances maybe notified in advance. Contextual landmarks like elevators or staircases and GPS signals at the edges of indoor environments can help to detect the proximity of the user to his residence. This service is called as geofencing [17]. For example, Fig. 3 shows the distinct accelerometer pattern generated from a smart phone inertial sensor while using an elevator. It depicts the sudden changes in acceleration during elevator taking and halting, with a stationary phase between the two. Such sequences can be analysed using algorithms like dynamic time warping (DTW) and are viable solutions to geofencing [25]. Table 1 shows the residential electricity consumption by end use for selected countries around the globe. This data reveals that HVAC (Heating ventilation and air conditioning), refrigeration and lighting loads constitute the major share of household electricity consumption. In commercial building HVAC systems, the primary energy consuming subsystems are the air handler units. They are responsible for mixing outside air with cool air from thermal zones, while variable air volume boxes control the quantity of conditioned air into the respective zone. In residential buildings, the compressors in air conditioners and refrigerators are the crucial energy consuming units. For a fixed temperature set point, these appliances generally work on fixed schedules assuming maximum occupancy. But if real time statistics like occupant count, identity or location are available, then the heating load in the room due to radiation from humans and other appliances like lights, can be calculated. This can help the building management system or home gateways to forecast the energy requirement of the building and initiate flexible control strategies [32,33]. 2.2 Energy saving case studies in commercial and residential buildings Various studies have been conducted on occupancy driven energy management in commercial buildings. Occupancy schedules collected through diverse modalities can be fed to tools such as EnergyPlus [34], to simulate the energy consumption of the building. Some researchers have also done practical deployments to calculate the actual energy savings obtained through occupancy driven appliance operation. Such control strategies could be divided into reactive and proactive/predictive schemes. The former responds to direct feedback from occupancy sensors while the latter is based on predictions from occupancy models [35,36]. In [37], the authors have designed a low cost ZigBee based sensor module for determining the binary occupancy in a university building. The sensor unit-a combination of magnetic door and PIR sensor, was connected with a microcontroller, to later adjust the temperature set point of HVACs in 10 rooms of the building. PIR and chair sensors controlled by Z-wave enabled switching nodes were used by authors in [38] to operate luminaries in an office building. Occupancy prediction models based on Markov Chain was used by authors in [39] to control the HVAC ventilation rates in 10 areas of a building. The occupant transitions were captured using grey scale cameras fitted on the ceiling at appropriate locations. In order to preserve the user privacy, the authors in [40] have employed 3D depth sensors for gathering the density and trajectory of occupants in two floors of a university building. This data was used by energy simulation models to develop dynamic operational schedules for HVAC systems. To detect users who carry out desk related activities, mechanical strain and vibration sensors were fitted on a typical office chair and used for lighting control [41]. In [42], an intelligent fusion of data from thermal sensors and cameras was used to develop a IoT based mobile application to control lighting and cooling loads in a laboratory. Carbon dioxide concentration levels and rate of air flow into a room are also indicators of changes in occupancy levels. This can be used to adjust the ventilation rate of HVACs, as reported by authors in [43]. Occupancy schedules could also be predicted by tracking smartphone internet connectivity data. Such methods avoid the need for any sensor deployment but requires adequate user permission. In Sentinel [44], the interaction of a client with a nearby WiFi access point was examined to reveal zone based occupancy in a university building. This data was utilized to control the setback temperature of HVACs using RESTful web services. A similar case study, conducted in a shopping center and an office complex, was used to develop occupant centric schedules for lighting and HVAC systems [45]. It is possible to find occupant data by studying the utilization of IT infrastructure in a building. This includes routers, WiFi access points, mouses and keyboards. This method has been employed by authors in [46] to simulate the energy savings from HVACs and lighting loads in 12 rooms of a commercial building. In the residential sector, majority of the research on occupant centric controls has been devoted to smart home thermostats [47]. In [48], the authors have designed a smart thermostat system for residential spaces, controlled by an occupancy simulator, to achieve energy savings between 11% and 34%. The occupancy model was based on the data from American time use survey. A nationwide study was conducted by authors in [47] to investigate the energy saving ability of smart home thermostats. It shows that adjusting the temperature setpoint during unoccupied cases and adopting a temperature setback strategy can bring energy savings from 10% to 20%, while maintaining user comfort. The energy efficiency of intelligent ventilation control strategies can be improved by using geofencing opportunities [49]. In addition to occupancy sensing, real time user localization can be used to generate energy saving recommendations for smart home users. With the help of a ZigBee based localization system, the authors in [50] have achieved energy savings up to 17%. Table 2 summarizes the salient features of the aforementioned case studies, along with the reported energy savings. Most of these techniques either utilize specially deployed sensors or simulated occupancy schedules from building occupancy surveys to gather occupant data. They fail to take advantage of existing infrastructure such as WiFi access points for passive occupancy sensing and localization. The current appliance control approaches could be elevated to the next level by exploiting the emerging IoT revolution. Although several smart thermostats from companies such as Google Nest [51] and Honeywell [52] have inbuilt presence detection sensors, such brands are expensive, have limited availability and not suitable for all climatic zones. It can be seen from Table 1 that in Asian countries such as India, 73% of the electricity in the residential sector is consumed by lighting and plug loads. Future research must be focussed on developing cost-effective and customized occupant centred IoT-HEMS solutions with substantial energy saving potential. Also, initiatives such as \u201cSaving Energy Nationwide in Structures with Occupancy Recognition\u201d by the U.S Department of Energy [53] have augmented the research in occupancy sensing-based energy management. 2.3 Classification of occupancy monitoring systems The design of any occupancy sensing system exhibits a trade off between accuracy and cost. If the aim of the system is to detect unauthorized access, then accuracy cannot be compromised. But if employed for energy saving, some percentage of error maybe acceptable. Cost involves capital costs for installation of necessary equipments and training cost for data collection and calibration. Reducing capital costs is an important consideration for residential location aware services [54]. The design complexity depends on the amount of occupancy information resolution required by the application. Spatial resolution could be categorized as building-level, zone-level, room level or location coordinate-level. Temporal resolution signifies the time interval at which the system must update itself. At the activity-level, binary presence, occupant count, identity or specific activities could be monitored [55]. Localization systems can be classified into active and passive schemes, depending on the amount of user participation required for location estimation. In active localization, a cooperative user carries an RF transceiver like an RFID tag, wearable accelerometer or smartphone along with them. These dedicated devices ensures connectivity with the home network and helps in user tracking. In passive localization, the target, also called a non cooperative user, does not carry any wearable sensor on their body. Passive schemes must be able to sense user movements by analysing signal parameters affected by human body (for example, Channel State Information (CSI)). Passive Infrared (PIR) sensors, cameras, ultrasound and visible light aid in user positioning without any wearable device. Monitoring the interaction of occupants with plug loads and environmental parameters like CO 2 levels also enable passive localization [56]. Some authors call the former as individualized sensing as it can track the exact user location. The latter maybe called as non-individualized sensing since they mainly aim at detecting occupant count or binary presence at the building or room level [32]. Fig. 4 depicts a useful classification of the above mentioned approaches. PIR sensors are suitable for detecting moving humans, especially in large hallways and corridors [57]. PIR sensors suffer from poor accuracy, particularly when the target is stationary for some duration. Although sensing stationary humans with PIR sensors is being researched [58], such products are not available commercially. Some recent works have employed vision based techniques to capture human movements with high level of accuracy [59]. Camera based sensing affects privacy, requires adequate ambient lighting and larger bandwidth for processing video signals. Thermal imagers are an alternative to vision based sensing systems [60], but not suitable for small structures such as residential buildings due to the cost of such cameras. Target detection using ultrasound and visible light require considerable changes in the existing infrastructure so as to assist localization. Monitoring of communication technology equipments is another methodology for tracking occupants, but suitable only for commercial buildings [61]. RFID and ZigBee technologies have been employed in home automation and target detection for the past two decades while Bluetooth and WiFi based localization has become popular in the recent past due to the pervasive nature of these technologies. Alternate location sensing approaches using smartphone inertial sensors, smart meters and environmental sensors are also promising research directions. 3 Wireless technologies for occupancy sensing and indoor localization Various wireless technologies such as RFID, ZigBee, Bluetooth and WiFi have paved the way for micro location based services in smart buildings [9,22]. They may be classified into range-based and range-free localization systems. Range-based methods utilize various signal metrics like received signal strength indicator (RSSI), channel state information (CSI), angle of arrival (AoA), time of flight (ToF), time difference of arrival (TDoA), return time of flight (RToF) or phase of arrival (PoA) to deduce the distance between known reference points and unknown target. A brief description of these signal parameters is given in Table 3. The exact location of the target can then be calculated using triangulation, trilateration or multilateration [62]. Fingerprinting is a kind of range-free localization method which infers the user position by creating a radio map of the site under study. It is conducted in two phases: an offline phase (survey) followed by an online phase (query). In the offline phase, a site survey is conducted to collect the signal vectors at reference points (RPs) laid out on the testing environment. Machine learning algorithms are then used to approximate the target position in the online phase, by finding a matching fingerprint. Although the rigorous site survey process and diverse environmental artefacts make fingerprinting challenging, it has gained immense research attention, owing to advances in crowdsourcing techniques for data collection and computing paradigms like the cloud [22,63]. 3.1 RFID based localization RFID was the most preferred wireless technology for delivering various location centric services a decade ago. It has been widely deployed for a variety of industrial applications like supply chain management, logistics and monitoring of personnel and structures in adverse conditions like construction sites. As a worthy contender for occupancy detection in HEMS [32], the key advantages of RFID technology are simplicity, affordability, ability to operate in hostile environments, non line of sight requirements, availability of on-board storage, energy efficiency and centimetre level accuracy using phase based schemes [64\u201366]. While passive RFIDs rely on the reader for power, have limited range and storage capacity, active and semi-passive RFIDs are powered by internal batteries. Passive RFIDs operate in the LF, HF and UHF range whereas active RFIDs work in the UHF and microwave frequencies. They have a read range within a few hundred meters [67,68]. A vast majority of the RFID based positioning systems employ RSSI as a signal metric to locate the target [68]. Preliminary approaches [70] were based on triangulation, as shown in Fig. 5(a). But they were not carried forward as dependence on empirical path loss models reduced the accuracy of location estimation. LANDMARC [71] was a pioneering work in RFID based localization, which could estimate the location of a target by finding its proximity to other active RFID tags placed at reference nodes. This method is depicted in Fig. 5(b). Later several attempts to reduce the number of reference tags and improve the accuracy of the LANDMARC system were made. These include RSSI spatial interpolation [72], removal of unlikely locations using virtual reference tags [73], removing the effect of tag diversity arising from tag type or ageing battery [74], smoothing of RSSI values and finding optimal placement of reference tags [75]. As RSSI is prone to environmental noise, Gaussian [76] and Kalman filters [69] can be used to preprocess the RFID signals from the tags and support vector regression can be applied to the LANDAMRC algorithm to obtain target tag position [77]. In [78], the authors have used LANDMARC algorithm to train a traditional back propagation (BP) neural network using location estimates from passive tracking tags deployed around reference tags. To prevent the BP network from being stuck at a local minima, particle swarm optimization algorithm can be used to initialize the weights of the neurons [79]. Lately, extreme learning machines (ELMs) have been employed to train RFID based positioning systems to achieve accuracies within half a meter [80]. In this method, Glow-worm swarm optimization, which simulates the behaviour of fireflies, was fused with sequential online ELM to design an RFID positioning system. It exhibited quick convergence with reduced number of labelled reference tags. Generally, RSSI is affected by multipath, reader antenna gain and orientation of the tag. Hence, recent researches have embraced phase-based methods to mitigate the effects of environment dynamics and achieve fine-grained resolution for stationary [64] and moving tags [65]. Centimetre level accuracy could be achieved by detecting the phase difference between a pair of tags placed on the target and analysing the impact of reader antenna position on accuracy [66]. Some researches have used UHF RFID antenna arrays to eliminate multi-path effects. This can be done by identifying two strongest line-of-sight paths through phase difference estimation at adjacent array elements [81]. Recently phase difference of arrival (PDoA) based localization has been applied to 5.8 GHz RFID tunnelling tags [82] for range extension up to 15 m. It can enable a host of IoT based applications while consuming comparable power as a conventional passive RFID tag [83]. Some of these recent advancements are summarized in Table 4. Though RFIDs offer a low cost and viable solution to occupancy detection for HEMS, the limitation of this technology include the following: \u2022 Passive RFIDs are limited in range whereas performance of active RFIDs falls significantly with battery usage. \u2022 RSSI based localization schemes are affected by multi-path effects in non-line of sight environments. \u2022 Although the phase of RFID signal is independent of frequency and tag orientation, distance estimation is affected by phase ambiguity and tag diversity. \u2022 Density and orientation of reference tags and the number of RFID readers influence the accuracy of location estimates. \u2022 Significant pre deployment time is needed for optimal placement of reader and reference tags. Also batteries of active tags must be frequently monitored for replacement. \u2022 The system requires a cooperative user who must carry a wearable tag on his body for successful tracking. 3.2 Bluetooth based localization Bluetooth technology available on all present day IoT devices can be harnessed for delivering short range, low data rate and power efficient localization services with inexpensive transceivers [84]. Like RFID, location estimation approaches were initially based on triangulation using Bluetooth RSSI [85]. As distance estimation from RSSI is highly error prone, cell-based methods could be used. This method combines the range of visible beacons and thereby infers a polygonal region within which the user could be located [84]. The paper also considers finding an optimal beacon placement using hyper-graphs, because the range of the beacons can take any arbitrary shape in an indoor space. Inquiry response rate (IRR) could also be used as location specific signatures instead of noisy RSSI fingerprints [86]. While this approach is very slow and not suitable for walking users, training multiple neural networks using RSSI values annotated with user orientations could significantly improve the speed of location estimation process [87]. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol, a subset of Bluetooth v4.0 (Bluetooth Smart) offers ultra-low power consumption during idle mode and is a preferable wireless communication standard for IoT applications. In 2013, Apple introduced the iBeacon- a proximity based utility with BLE as its communication protocol. Using this service, any iOS device can identify a region around itself based on the received signal strength from a beacon and thus could be used for geofencing solutions. Any iBeacon advertisement consists of 3 values, namely a mandatory 16 byte UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) that specifies a beacon area and optional 2 byte major and minor values that designate subregions within the area defined by the UUID. Though not specially designed to predict the user\u2019s exact location with a map, it could be used for obtaining a coarse occupancy information with room-level granularity [88]. BlueSentinel [89] leverages the iBeacon technology for the design of a room-level occupancy system with one beacon per room. According to the iBeacon technology, when the iOS device is locked or when the application is running in the background, the device is notified only when it moves from one region to another or when it does not receive any signal from a region for 30 s. This means that fine-grained user tracking is challenging. To overcome this difficulty, the authors have modified the iBeacon protocol to create false events by allowing the beacons to advertise the regions in a cyclic fashion. This will wake up the devices frequently and hence allow continuous user tracking. Later iBeacon was used for healthcare applications to monitor patients remotely [90] and help them find nearest wards or departments [91]. Combining iBeacons with particle filters can enhance the accuracy of position estimates to less than a meter [92]. Also, they can be used in conjunction with other wireless protocols like WiFi for correcting the drift in location predictions made by smart phone inertial sensors [93]. Although Bluetooth based localization requires active user participation, the authors in [94] have tried to reduce the user effort by doing away with the need for any app installation on their smartphones. BLE beacons are programmed using Raspberry pi such that the MAC address, RSSI value and current timestamp of Bluetooth enabled devices can be stored on the beacon. Working along similar lines to collect the training database, the authors in [55] have used a supervised ensemble model and a semi-supervised K means clustering algorithm to deduce occupancy information. Predictions made by the supervised model was used to generate occupancy profiles which could be an aid to improve the energy performance gap of any building. The paper reiterates the fact that studying the occupants behaviour and routine schedules is vital for the design of energy efficient buildings. Table 5 gives an overview of some significant developments in Bluetooth based localization. The major shortcomings of using Bluetooth technology for localization could be summarized as follows: \u2022 Due to short communication range, dense beacon installation is required to obtain adequate coverage. However, interference between beacons adversely affects positioning accuracy. \u2022 Device discovery in Bluetooth is a slow process, taking around 10 s. Hence, if discovery is stopped at an early stage, then some nearby beacons which are slow to respond maybe missed, affecting the localization accuracy. Also, tracking fast moving targets becomes difficult as they cannot be easily detected by the network. \u2022 Users must always carry their Bluetooth enabled device with them so as to be detected by the system, which may not be the case when they are at home. \u2022 If the system requires that the devices must always be in connection mode, it can raise data security issues. Algorithms that suffice only discoverable mode would be more acceptable to users. The aforementioned challenges suggest that Bluetooth is more suitable for proximity based services and positioning of persons with minimum mobile characteristics. This may include applications such as monitoring of patients and aged citizens or studying occupancy profiles in commercial buildings. 3.3 ZigBee RSSI based localization for smart homes ZigBee technology has been widely used for interconnecting various components in a smart home wireless sensor network primarily because of its low installation and running cost, low data rate and reduced power consumption (ZigBee devices have duty cycle less than 1%). The highly reliable mesh topology offers wider range and capability to support more than 64000 nodes per network. Also newly added nodes can be easily identified by the network [95,96]. ZigBee RSSI based localization has been well studied in literature [97]. Generally such techniques are based on fingerprinting the signal strength at reference nodes. These anchor nodes are deployed at known locations across the test bed and targets (also called blind nodes) are located by matching its signal strength to the appropriate fingerprint. Reference nodes, configured as Zigbee routers, are connected to a ZigBee coordinator which can directly communicate with a server or a host computer for data analysis or storage. This is an added advantage of ZigBee over RFID or Bluetooth technology. This is because the latter two technologies have to rely on another communication protocol, preferably WiFi, for data transfer to the server. In [98], the authors have combined three positioning algorithms, namely gradient based search, linear least squares and multidimensional scaling to improve localization accuracy. It is well known that presence of humans and other obstacles can attenuate RF signals by shadowing effect. In [99], the authors have analysed the RSSI variations between ZigBee node links for a predefined time interval and compared the changes in signal strength with empirically determined thresholds. This kind of device free localization system could be used for control of plug loads and lights through smart outlets. It is especially suitable for a smart home system where users are reluctant to carry any wearable RF transceiver with them. In [100], the authors have used ZigBee RSSI and ROC curves to achieve accurate room level localization. A wearable ZigBee device placed on the user\u2019s body emits beacons at regular intervals. ZigBee anchor nodes are installed at known locations in each room of the house and can communicate with the wearable device. Based on experimentally determined thresholds from receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, the user is classified to the correct room. Moreover, exact position of the user was determined by calculating his/her proximity to ZigBee receivers placed on various appliances in the smart home. Low transmission power and narrow band signals make ZigBee RSSI highly unstable and hence affects the accuracy of RSS based fingerprinting techniques. As WiFi and ZigBee have overlapping channels, some researchers follow a novel approach to reduce ZigBee RSS instability and power consumption by estimating WiFi RSS using ZigBee sensor nodes. In ZIL [101], ZigBee interfaces available on certain Android tablets and mobile phones are employed to create a database of WiFi fingerprints. Since ZigBee devices are unable to demodulate WiFi signals, specialized signal detection methods like RSS quantification and normalization is required to identify the WiFi access points. Systems like ZigLoc [102] and MuCHLoc [63] are designed using this method. They utilize the ZigBee channels overlapping with the WiFi signals, so as to uncover WiFi RSS through channel diversity. Though power consumption can be reduced to a great extent, decoding WiFi signals introduces latency into these systems. Table 6 recapitulates the advantages and shortcomings the above mentioned works. Challenges in ZigBee based localization can be identified as follows: \u2022 Though RSS based fingerprinting is a popular localization mechanism, ZigBee RSS is severely affected by the indoor environment. This is because ZigBee devices transmit at lower power levels and use narrow band channels which are prone to frequency selective fading [63]. \u2022 As WiFi, Bluetooth and ZigBee share the same 2.4 GHz ISM band, cross technology interference affects packet reliability in low power ZigBee transmissions [103]. 3.4 Exploiting existing WiFi infrastructure for occupancy sensing Localization techniques based on ZigBee, Bluetooth or RFID requires dedicated hardware, which can emit beacons from predefined anchor nodes laid across the test environment. This pre-deployment and maintenance of sensors incurs substantial effort and cost for a home owner. Also wearable sensors placed on the user\u2019s body can affect their comfort level. Today most of the urban households are equipped with WiFi routers that ensures ubiquitous connectivity for a number of smart devices to the internet. Researchers have utilized this existing WiFi infrastructure as a suitable candidate for indoor positioning due to the following reasons [27]: \u2022 WiFi offers a cost effective solution for location estimation as it is already available in indoor spaces like offices and residential buildings. \u2022 WiFi routers can easily be deployed at any point of interest. It can also be conveniently replaced or relocated. \u2022 WiFi signals are non-invasive and can achieve localization with minimum disturbance to the user. RADAR [104], Horus [105], EZ [106] and Zee [107] are some fundamental WiFi based localization schemes that exploit various characteristics of the WiFi signal for indoor positioning. RADAR [104] makes use of radio frequency signal strengths to locate and track users in an indoor environment. By placing three base stations at selected locations in the floor of interest, RSS values at various reference points were collected manually. In the online phase, user localization and tracking was done by averaging of k nearest neighbours that match with the database collected in the offline phase. RADAR suffers from poor accuracy because localization is based on RF signal strength which is inherently noisy. It also involves significant pre-deployment effort and rigorous data collection. The indoor model is parameter dependent and the system also needed prior knowledge of the building floor plan. Horus [105] is a probabilistic approach to indoor localization. Given the radio map constructed during offline phase, the Horus system tries to find the location x that maximizes the probability P ( x | s ) , where s is the signal strength vector from k access points. A labour intensive site survey needs to be conducted for database creation. Also, fingerprints are subjected to variations over time and changes in indoor environment. In E Z [106], Genetic algorithm is employed to obtain a relative distance estimate of the user location. According to the log-distance path loss (LDPL) model for RF signal transmission, the distance d i j between the i th AP and j th mobile user can be estimated using Eq. (1). Here P i is the AP transmit power, p i j is the received signal strength in dBm and γ i is the path loss exponent. (1) d i j = 1 0 ( P i − p i j 10 γ i ) EZ makes an initial guess for the unknown parameters in Eq. (1). It assumes that the user obtains an occasional location fix from GPS signals available at the edges of the indoor environment under consideration. More the number of known locations (obtained from GPS signals), faster would be the convergence of Genetic algorithm. Once the locations of three non-collinear APs are obtained, the user location can be estimated using normal triangulation. This scheme assumes availability of GPS signals and a dense deployment of WiFi APs throughout the indoor environment. Also the parameters of the path loss model can vary across different indoor settings and hence affects system scalability. Zee [107] is a calibration free system which exploits inertial measurement units (IMUs) in modern smartphones to construct a training database. Timestamped WiFi scans were also recorded along with the user trajectory so as to aid the final location estimation process. As the evaluation was carried out with a single user, the system does not account for device heterogeneity. Also, if the user is continuously walking, RSS values will be highly unstable. Convergence will be slower, especially when the user makes short paths with less number of turns. These techniques, summarized in Table 7, have formed the foundation for a vast amount research on WiFi based indoor localization. WiFi fingerprinting based indoor localization has been extensively studied by the research community and is depicted in Fig. 6. A recent study [23] provides a detailed survey of WiFi fingerprinting techniques and classifies them into deterministic, probabilistic, temporal or spatial pattern-based and collaborative localization schemes. The closeness of a WiFi access point can be detected either by detecting a single peak [108] or by analysing a whole signal sequence. In Walkie-Markie, for example, a rising and falling RSS sequence from a moving user is examined to reveal the proximity of a WiFi AP [109]. User\u2019s position estimate can be corrected by uniquely classifying WiFi APs, which form landmarks, as is used in UnLoc [110] and MapCraft [111]. Systems like HALLWAY [112] considers the order of RSS values from multiple APs at a given location to reduce measurement errors and device dependency. When multiple linked users are present, their encounter and non-encounter events are utilized to correct positioning errors through distance-based [113,114] or proximity-based [115] collaborative localization schemes. In general, WiFi RSSI based fingerprinting has various drawbacks essentially arising from variation in received signal characteristics in an indoor environment [23,25]. This is also clear from Fig. 7 which shows the large variations in WiFi RSSI values collected from a two bedroom apartment under various scenarios. Diversity in the receiver equipment can also produce different signal strengths at the same location at the same instant of time. The major challenges in WiFi RSSI fingerprinting are: \u2022 Vulnerability to measurement error- WiFi fingerprints in an indoor setting are always subject to multipath fading, ambient temperature and humidity changes. Due to this, multiple locations can have same or similar fingerprints making it difficult to distinguish such nodes. \u2022 War-drive site survey- Collection of fingerprint database is time-consuming, labour intensive and susceptible to changes in indoor setting. Movement of furniture, addition, removal or changes in position of WiFi APs or other obstacles like walls, may require that the database be constructed again. \u2022 Lack of context awareness- WiFi RSSI fingerprints are unable to characterize user activities like walking, running or standing as well as usage of landmarks like elevator or staircase. \u2022 Device heterogeneity- The large number of mobile devices available in the market differ in chipset specifications, antenna position and OS. Hence fingerprints at the same location may produce varying RSSI values in different devices. \u2022 Achieving energy efficiency- Frequency of WiFi scanning and the number of APs scanned can drain the battery of mobile devices. A major downside in employing WiFi based localization for a home environment, unlike that in an office building is that, the number of WiFi APs are usually restricted to one or two. This makes traditional localization infeasible. In order to address this challenging situation, localization techniques using single access points have been explored by researchers and is described in the following subsection. 3.4.1 Single WiFi AP based localization These systems primarily rely on information extracted from the physical layer, formally called CSI, as it supplies useful and robust data regarding the multipath effects of the environment. The WiFi standard IEEE 802.11a/g/n systems use orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) to modulate the digital information. It is a type of multi-carrier modulation, where each sub-channel carries low bit rate data. Extracting CSI of all the OFDM sub-carriers requires devices equipped with 802.11n network interface cards (NICs) and special tools like Linux based 802.11n CSI tool from Intel [116] or Atheros CSI tool [117]. CSI could also be extracted from some smartphones and SoCs such as Raspberry Pi 3B+ or ESP32 modules using tools like Nexmon CSI Extractor [118] or ESP32 CSI tool [119,120]. Fig. 8 shows raw CSI plots collected from a typical home environment using ESP32 node MCU. CUPID [121] is a single AP system which uses signal energy from the direct path to estimate target position. It additionally incorporates location corrections from smartphone inertial sensors. The direct path signal is identified through power delay profiling. Power delay profile depicts the strength of multipath components as a function of propagation delay. It can be derived by transforming frequency domain CSI into time domain using inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT). But a practical implementation of this system requires 4\u20135 APs operating on the same channel. SAIL [122], an extension of CUPID, estimates ToF from the channel impulse response and mitigates some of the shortcomings of the former. Chronos [123] was one of the earliest techniques that was able to achieve decimeter level localization accuracy with a single WiFi AP. The distance between a user and a WiFi AP was found by estimating absolute ToF from CSI of WiFi sub-carriers. During the evaluation process, users carried a laptop with Intel 5300 WiFi cards along with them, in order to emulate the receiver. Transmitter and receiver were made to hop between multiple frequency bands. Channel measurements gathered across different frequencies were stitched together to compute accurate ToF. Targets could be localized with less than a meter error in both line-of-sight (LoS) and non-LoS situations. A Splicer-enhanced CUPID system [117] employs spliced CSI measurements with much higher time resolution, as an input to the original CUPID algorithm. This system can make precise power delay profiling of multipath attributes for accurate estimation of the direct path component. In [124], the authors have used logistic regression and deep learning to extract user location from CSI amplitude and phase, to obtain a median accuracy close to a meter. Lately, in [125] the authors have developed a single AP based positioning system which combines RSS fingerprints with motion sensor data. AP-device angle and distance is estimated using wireless path loss models, differential RSS and antenna differential gain. To eliminate outliers, pedestrian dead reckoning through extended Kalman filter has been incorporated. All the above methods require the user to carry their smartphone (or laptop) with them to maintain continuous connection with the AP. But when users are at their residence, they usually leave their smart devices elsewhere while attending to household chores. In such a situation, the localization system looses track of the target. Also continuous WiFi connectivity reduces battery lifetime. Time stamped occupancy data and trends in appliance usage patterns collected from the past can serve as a localization aid in such challenging cases, but with a substantial loss in accuracy. Thus WiFi based device-free localization systems have been under research over the past decade and some latest developments in this area is described below. 3.4.2 Device-free localization (DFL) for smart homes These systems rely on the variation in signal characteristics (such as RSSI or CSI) arising from human presence. Different studies have shown that WiFi CSI can be used to reveal human activity or gestures. AoA extracted from CSI values could be used to separate out the target reflection paths from other static paths and hence be used to estimate target location [126]. In LiFS [127], sub-carriers that are least affected by multipath are preprocessed and target location is constrained using a power fading model. Attempting to combine IoT devices and the cloud, authors in [128] have designed a device free localization system for smart homes and small business enterprises. They have employed two IoT devices, ie two commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) WiFi routers, to extract CSI amplitude of all the 114 WiFi subcarriers at 5 GHz. The router firmware was upgraded using OpenWrt, which is a Linux based operating system. The system makes coarse measurements regarding user presence in a room as well as fine grained measurements on locomotion modality. Signal tendency index (STI) is used as a similarity index for CSI curves. This kind of feature extraction is carried out on the cloud server and made available to the user using MQTT protocol. WiFree [129] employs a similar methodology for crowd counting as well. These works leverage IoT enabled platforms to offer a cost effective design and are prospective solutions for energy management in smart homes. A summary of the aforementioned techniques is given in Tables 8 and 9. An investigation of these tables reveals the capability of WiFi technology to achieve up to sub-meter level localization accuracy and highly precise occupancy detection. Ubiquitous WiFi connectivity is now widely available in modern residential apartments and individual houses. As all the present day IoT devices have WiFi chipsets, this technology can be judiciously deployed for energy savings in IoT enabled HEMS. 4 Opportunistic occupancy sensing techniques for HEMS 4.1 User tracking with smartphone inertial sensors Yet another expedient indoor occupancy detection scheme is to leverage the inertial sensors in modern smartphones to reveal location specific information. This technique either in conjunction with indoor maps [130] or other wireless localization systems [107] can provide a wealth of information about the trajectory taken by the user and his current position. Mobility has emerged as a novel candidate for indoor localization because the present location of any target is the result of his past movements [25]. IMUs in smartphones are primarily constituted of accelerometers, gyroscopes and magnetometers. Accelerometers can sense the linear acceleration in three dimension or the g-force. Gyroscopes can measure three dimensional angular velocity and therefore used for turn detection in localization systems. Magnetometers detect the strength and direction of magnetic fields in the environment and can be harnessed for magnetic fingerprint based localization [131]. Traditional pedestrian navigation systems (PNS) can track moving users by dead reckoning with the help of an initial location fix [132]. For a mobile target, the normal walking pattern is characterized by his/her step count, step length, number of turns and heading direction. Temporal [133] and spatial analysis [134] of filtered acceleration traces are primarily used for step count estimation. Temporal information can be extracted by detecting peaks in the acceleration trace or counting zero-crossings in the waveform. For example, Fig. 9 shows how steps can be detected from an acceleration trace collected from an android phone. Spurious peaks are eliminated and only those with a height within one standard deviation are counted [135]. Supervised machine learning techniques are also used for counting steps by extracting various features like mean, variance, standard deviation, energy or entropy from acceleration traces [134]. Step count when multiplied with step length gives the user displacement from an initial known location. Stride (two steps) length estimation is complicated as it is largely affected by a person\u2019s age, physique [136] or characteristics of the walking surface. Thus, algorithms that can adapt to an individual\u2019s walking pattern are needed, in order to address such diversified cases [137]. Direction information includes turning and heading estimation, which can be gathered from gyroscopes or compass. But, both these sensor readings are affected either by phone placement with respect to user walking direction or presence of magnetic materials in the surroundings [131]. In [25], the authors provide a detailed review on distance and direction estimation approaches from smart phone inertial sensors. Additionally, some recent works also focus on human activity recognition from smartphone inertial sensors [138,139]. This methodology finds plenty of applications in healthcare monitoring of elderly and energy saving in automated homes [140]. As smartphone IMUs are constrained by size, cost and power consumption [25], the designer has to overcome several issues when such sensors are utilized for localization purpose. These include: \u2022 Phone inertial sensor data is error prone due to incorrect measurement and calibration errors. \u2022 As the user may hold the mobile phone in diverse positions, various errors can creep in due to phone placement. For example, random bouncing of the phones when placed in a bag can affect acceleration traces. Similarly placement offsets hinder heading estimation when using compass readings. \u2022 Also, classifying human walking patterns, which is highly heterogeneous, is a challenging task. In order to adapt to the dynamic characteristics of human kinematics and enhance localization accuracy, researchers have employed Bayesian filtering. This technique helps in improved fusion of various wireless technologies with smartphone IMU data. In the Bayesian approach, the posterior probability density function (pdf) p ( x 0 : k | z 1 : k ) of the system state is constructed by recursively estimating the state sequence x 0 : k of a target from available measurements z 1 : k up to time k [141]. The discrete Kalman filter is a predictor\u2013corrector algorithm that offers an optimal solution to this non linear tracking problem. It is widely employed for mobile assisted localization and assumes the posterior density to be Gaussian [142]. Smartphone sensors produce unique patterns when the user passes through contextual landmarks like elevators (Fig. 3), stairs or doorways. The authors in [143] attempts to combine these landmarks with WiFi signals and pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) using Kalman filter. WiFi signal strength is computed using a weighted path loss model, reducing the effort for a war drive site survey. When the Gaussian assumption does not hold and the density function is bi-modal or skewed, suboptimal algorithms like extended Kalman filter (EKF) and particle filters are adopted. For example, in [144], two EKFs are employed to determine the walking direction (by integrating gyroscopes and accelerometers) and location coordinates (by combining WiFi RSS fingerprints with PDR). EKFs make an approximate assumption that the density is Gaussian but introduces large errors in the posterior mean and covariance. The unscented Kalman filters (UKF) produces remarkable improvements by representing the state distribution by a set of carefully selected points from the approximate Gaussian pdf [145]. Hence it offers the possibility of fusing WiFi signals with pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR). Unlike EKFs, UKFs eliminate the need for computing the high dimensional Jacobian matrix and can even be used for accurate 3D positioning [144]. Particle filters are sequential Monte Carlo methods where the posterior pdf is represented by a set of random samples with associated weights [141]. If x 0 : k i is a set of support points with normalized weights w k i and x 0 : k is the set of all states up to time k , then the posterior pdf is represented by Eq. (2) (2) p ( x 0 : k | z 1 : k ) ≈ ∑ i = 1 N s w k i δ ( x 0 : k − x 0 : k i ) Zee [107] was one of the first systems to implement smartphone IMU based indoor localization by particle filter approach. Particles were propagated across the indoor environment under consideration and those that do not satisfy the wall constraints were filtered out. In [130], the authors make use of a linear personalization model to fit the dynamic user walking patterns using particle filtering. Step length is determined through a combination of peak detection, heuristics and DTW. This data along with the heading estimate is fed into the particle filter. Particles that do not align with the wall constraints are eliminated and the step model is continuously updated on the fly. The authors in [146] also follow a similar approach to correct heading estimates that are determined through principal component analysis of acceleration traces. iBeacons can also be fused with WiFi fingerprints and PDR using particle filter. In this approach, particles are initialized based on the position estimate from WiFi fingerprints. These WiFi signatures are collected by non-intrusively monitoring the WiFi traffic from COTs routers. Particle weights are sequentially updated and corrected based on the proximity to WiFi routers and the iBeacon [93]. As summarized in Table 10, fusion of mobile phone sensors and wireless technologies opens up immense number of opportunities for cost effective occupancy detection in infrastructure constrained environments like smart homes. 4.2 Occupancy sensing using electricity consumption data from smart meters Electricity consumption data that is readily available from smart power meters provides a non-invasive and cost effective alternative for occupancy detection. This technique is driven by the fact that when a house is occupied, the users tend to have more interaction with loads such as kitchen appliances, lights, fans or air conditioners. These interactions manifests themselves as an increase in overall power consumption or as burst loads in the load curve. For example, Fig. 10 shows a typical day for household 1 in the publicly available electricity consumption and occupancy (ECO) dataset [147,148]. It depicts interaction of users with loads like kettle, washing machine and dryer at specific instants. At the same time, background loads like fridge and freezer consume some standby power throughout the day. Nonintrusive load monitoring (NILM) [149] can be used to identify which appliance is currently active from the aggregate electricity consumption data. Non intrusive occupancy monitoring (NIOM) [14] is a zero training threshold based approach to infer user presence by fixing thresholds for various power metrics such as average power, standard deviation and power range. The thresholds are fixed by considering either the maximum or average of the corresponding metric at night time. If these discrete time stamped occupancy events fall within a certain time window, that particular duration is labelled as occupied. But employing night time appliance usage patterns to generate thresholds may not be a good indicator of minimal utilization of interactive loads. In [150], the authors have developed an ECO dataset, where overall power consumption annotated with occupancy data from 5 Swiss households were collected for 8 months. After pre-processing of the dataset, 10 representative features of mean, standard deviation and sum of absolute differences (SAD) were derived. This work was extended to 35 features in a work published later on [147]. It includes the absolute value, variability and dependence of power consumption on occupancy. This dataset was used to train 4 stateless classifiers, namely support vector machines (SVMs), K-nearest neighbours (KNN), Gaussian mixture models (GMMS), simple thresholding (THR) and a stateful classifier like Hidden Markov Models (HMM). Though classification accuracy and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) are used to evaluate the performance of the classifiers, the authors also stress the need for reducing false positive and false negative rate. Ground truth collection is a cumbersome process in all these systems. The users need to indicate their presence either in a terminal placed near the entrance of a house or through some mobile app (like Google Latitude). Additional motion sensors and smart plugs may need to be installed on selected appliances to verify the data entered by the users. In case the ground truth data is sparse, Non intrusive learning (NL) and transfer learning (TL) approaches are used to estimate occupancy status [54]. In the absence of occupancy information in the training data, NL can correlate the electricity consumption data with time. When the data from the target house is limited, TL is used to infer the occupancy by correlating the target household\u2019s power consumption with other houses that share similar usage patterns. In [14], a number of features that capture the magnitude, transition and transient effects of the power consumed is employed for training the classifiers and evaluated on the ECO dataset. These techniques are summarized in Table 11. In general, occupancy sensing using electricity consumption data must address the following challenges: \u2022 If the occupants are at home but do not interact with any loads, then the connection between occupancy and power consumption is broken. \u2022 Most of the techniques in literature derive only binary occupancy data. In order to estimate room level occupancy status, one must have knowledge of which appliance is located in which room. Also, it must be possible to accurately disaggregate device level consumption from the overall power consumption. \u2022 Some high power consuming loads like air conditioners are operated seasonally. This narrows down the difference between occupied and unoccupied scenarios, especially during winter months. \u2022 Also, ground truth collection is an arduous procedure. It requires installation of motion sensors to confirm user presence and smart plugs to identify usage of interactive loads. 4.3 Fusion of environmental sensors for occupancy detection Integration of environmental sensors that can perceive ambient parameters such as carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), carbon monoxide (CO), temperature, humidity, small particulate matter, illumination or acoustics, render a novel approach for occupancy modelling [151]. Though these sensors were primarily employed for assessing indoor air quality, their scope could be extended further because presence of humans can bring changes in CO 2 levels. Open windows, air conditioners or heaters can affect the temperature and humidity levels in a room. Also, activities like cooking alters the amount of volatile organic compounds in the air. This is evident from Fig. 11, which portrays how human presence in an office room affects the indoor air quality [152]. Environmental sensors are minimally intrusive and have the potential of detecting users with room-level granularity. Unlike PIR sensors which are unable to detect stationary and non line of sights targets, environmental sensors can locate mobile users and do not have dead spots. Simple installation and reasonable price also augment the prospects of this technique for smart home localization. This approach, sometimes called sensing by proxy, can also be used to count the number occupants and thereby control building ventilation to raise user comfort and save energy [153]. Supervised machine learning techniques like KNNs, decision trees, neural networks, SVMs and statistical models such as HMMs have been used historically to extract useful features from environmental sensors and make occupancy predictions [151,154,155]. In recent approaches such as [152], time stamped environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, CO 2 and relative humidity along with camera based ground truth occupancy data were collected from an office building. Supervised learning models such as linear discriminant analysis (LDA), classification and regression trees (CART) and random forest (RF) were then trained to derive binary occupancy information. LDA was found to produce promising results when light was combined with other predictors. In [156], the authors have adopted Dempster\u2013Shafer evidence theory (DSET) for sensor fusion by adopting the dataset in [152]. DSET involves the generation of probability mass assignments (PMAs) to different hypotheses of a system and then suitably combining them to reveal the system status, which in this case is the occupancy information. Results from this work shows that the combination of light and CO 2 sensors have very good classification ability and can be used to remotely control the set points of HVAC equipments. Low cost total volatile organic compounds (TVOC) sensors have nearly the same predictive power as CO 2 sensors which are relatively expensive [157]. In this paper, data from temperature and humidity sensors were also combined with TVOC and CO 2 sensors. Various classifiers such as Naïve Bayes (NB), C4.5 decision tree, logistic regression, KNN and random forest were then trained by extracting relevant features. This work also highlights the capability of supervised learning models to make predictions in residential buildings where training data is unavailable, utilizing models constructed from identically sized apartments. Unsupervised learning models such as Hidden Markov models (HMMs) can also make occupancy predictions without any ground truth data [158]. HMMs developed from the first order difference of sensor parameters in [152] was used to predict daily and hourly occupancy patterns in a residential house. The results from this work gives insights into the effects of window or door status, operation of HVAC equipments, type of parameter being analysed, position of sensor and the kind of time average chosen on the accuracy of HMMs. Although CO 2 measurements can accurately indicate human presence, they need considerably more time to respond to changes in occupancy pattern. To circumvent this difficulty, the authors in [153] have developed a sensing by proxy (SbP) model for indoor CO 2 concentrations using partial differential equations. This model helps to promptly predict occupant count and can aid the building management system to adopt flexible ventilation strategies for energy efficiency. Table 12 summarizes the important features of these recent fusion approaches and reveals their competence in detecting occupants with good accuracy. Some of the noteworthy limitations of environmental sensors when used for occupancy estimation are: \u2022 Accuracy of the trained model depends on the position of sensors in a room and their proximity to the inhabitants. \u2022 Performance of sensors can drift with time and necessitates regular calibration. \u2022 Appropriate combination of sensors must be chosen to improve accuracy. Including data from all of them can produce misleading results. Also, employing only a single parameter such as light can cause large number of false positives because users might have forgotten to turn off lights after leaving the room. \u2022 Detection errors can be high in warm seasons. \u2022 CO 2 levels are primary indicators of human presence. But these sensors are expensive and highly susceptible to variations in ambient conditions. Also, when people are moving in and out rapidly, CO 2 sensors take more time to attain a perceivable threshold (10\u201320 min) [159]. \u2022 Also training data and ground truth collection requires considerable effort and is inevitable in any approach that uses machine learning algorithms. 5 Evaluation of various occupancy detection and localization schemes 5.1 Evaluation criteria All the above mentioned occupancy detection and localization schemes are evaluated based on the following criteria to decide their suitability for HEMS: \u2022 Infrastructure required, installation cost and maintenance frequency: These parameters decide the overall cost of the system and is the primary factor deciding the acceptance rate by home owners. \u2022 Accuracy: It is the second important factor because false positives (predicting occupancy in user absence) can cost heavily on the user\u2019s electricity bill and false negatives (predicting no occupancy in user presence) tend to affect their comfort level. \u2022 User participation: The user\u2019s role in occupancy detection and localization process could be either active or passive. Active techniques essentially require the users to carry a wearable RF transceiver along with them, in order to be perceivable by the network. This affects their comfort level. Passive users can be correctly detected only if the signal/environmental parameters affected by their presence are accurately monitored. \u2022 Latency: The potential for real time application necessitates a system with good response time. Slow device discovery and inability to detect user transitions affects real time applicability. \u2022 Spatial resolution: While some applications may require only a building or room level occupancy detection, others may require the exact position of the user to be evaluated. This depends on the size of each room and the position or nature of the electrical appliances that need to be controlled. \u2022 Adoption rate: Wireless technologies like Bluetooth, ZigBee and WiFi have been widely adopted for smart home automation and can easily be extended for localization applications. But passive techniques which employ smart meters or environmental sensors are still in their nascent phase. \u2022 Scalability: With a number of emerging IoT enabling communication and networking technologies, a scalable design is always desirable for accuracy improvement and service expansion. \u2022 Energy efficiency: Energy conservation is the fundamental objective of a HEMS design. Hence, any occupancy detection and localization system by itself should be energy efficient. This is because complex and accurate systems generally tend to consume a lot of battery power. \u2022 Privacy: In today\u2019s data rich world, consumers look for services that provide preservation of sensitive information. Hence, occupancy detection systems must also take into account the privacy of its inhabitants, while they are being monitored. 5.2 Discussion A close examination of Table 13, which portrays this comparison, highlights the fact that among the wireless technologies described in this paper, ZigBee and WiFi provide reasonably high accuracy in detecting targets with low installation and maintenance cost. WiFi based techniques can provide sub-meter level accuracy for localization and enables passive occupancy detection and activity monitoring as well. Smartphone IMUs help in geofencing or tracking mobile users and exhibits the potential of local or cloud based data storage and analytics. Smartphones are an important component of the IoT infrastructure. Thus, utilizing the inertial sensors in these devices for localization offers a cost-effective solution for the user detection problem in HEMS. But, local processing and continuous internet connectivity drains the device battery and hence energy efficient algorithms are the need of the hour. At the other end of the occupancy detection spectrum, passive techniques based on smart meters and environmental sensors also aid in detecting users at a building-level or room-level. But, their suitability in real time applications needs considerable research from the scientific community. Fig. 12 gives a comprehensive picture of various occupancy sensing modalities that are suitable for HEMS application. These techniques could be combined with ambient temperature and daylight intensity data in order to generate intelligent control schemes for domestic loads, without compromising user comfort. As shown in Fig. 13, a cloud based decision making model, with necessary historic data and user preferences stored in it, ensures fail safe operation and minimizes resource utilization. Hence occupancy driven energy management combined with renewable energy generation, can transform domestic consumers to prosumers, transferring surplus energy generated locally to the smart grid. The scalability and security of such an IoT enabled HEMS can be enhanced by incorporating blockchain technology [160], [161]. This system allows several HEMS in a community to make secure and efficient energy transactions through smart contracts, enabling the creation of a self sufficient and sustainable micro-grid. The blockchain technology can help resource sharing among several micro-grid communities in a smart city, thereby reducing the energy shortage and load of distribution companies. 6 Challenges in occupancy detection for a home environment and future directions In a home environment, the number of active or passive users that must be monitored is usually limited in number. For active participants, the degree of device heterogeneity is much less compared to public places like offices, malls or airports. Also, the availability of building floor plans can aid localization and tracking algorithms. In spite of these favourable factors, residential buildings present a number of challenges to the designer. These issues must be precisely addressed by the researcher for successful design of any occupancy detection system for HEMS. Points 6.6 to 6.12 are applicable to any energy management system while 6.1 to 6.5 are specific to the home environment. Table 14 provides some feasible solutions to the below mentioned challenges. 6.1 Sparsity in the number of access points In most of the papers on WiFi based localization, evaluation is performed in office buildings where there is always a dense deployment of WiFi APs. Such techniques cannot be applied in a home environment because the number of WiFi APs is restricted to one or rarely two. Localization using single APs is challenging because of signal degradation in through-the-wall scenarios. Hence effective signal processing or fusion with other techniques such as smartphones is required. At home the users cannot be expected to carry the smart devices with them always. Hence tracking becomes difficult and necessitates passive methods for locating the target. Device free sensing systems have the capability to detect human presence by precisely studying the variation in radio signal characteristics in the test environment [162]. But, when multiple users or rooms must be classified, each user located in a separate room would necessitate a unique transmitter receiver pair for monitoring. This will increase the system cost. Thus, restricted number of WiFi APs is a major obstacle to WiFi based localization in smart homes. 6.2 Predictability and dwell time When a user is in his office, he will usually have fixed work schedules and the chance of remaining in a fixed location (for example \u2014 classroom, lab, office, lunch area) for a longer duration is more. But when at home, people are free to move around and will be continuously changing position from one room to another. Hence location predictability reduces. Also in order to enable heavy loads such as air conditioners, a minimum threshold must be fixed for the user\u2019s dwell time in a particular room. However the user must be ready to accept this delay. Unpredictability in user mobility is a major challenge in HEMS design. 6.3 Need for standard protocols for HEMS There are no standard protocols set apart for home energy management systems. Most of the present day home appliances are non-IP based and their firmware must be upgraded to ensure communication with the home gateway. Interoperability between the communication protocols used for occupancy sensing and appliance scheduling is also a major issue that needs to be addressed. A well designed home gateway that can handle such a heterogeneous network is required for fast, secure and error free data communication. 6.4 Challenges related to adoption of such techniques by the public In under developed countries where there has been a lot of unplanned urban development, the number of people who will be ready to invest in additional infrastructure for home energy management is also a question. Thus, techniques which have very low pre-deployment cost and make use of existing IoT devices like WiFi routers, smartphones and PCs or laptops will be preferred. Also most of the modern wireless localization techniques need access to the internet for analytics and user interaction. In developed countries like the United States of America, internet penetration is more than 87% of the population. But in a developing country like India, only 50% of the people have access to wireless internet, of which only 0.62 million use fixed wireless technologies like WiFi [163]. 6.5 Vulnerability to power failures Commercial buildings are usually equipped with adequate power backup to handle emergency power shutdown problems. Similarly residential buildings also require additional battery power or renewable energy sources to maintain the required performance of the energy management system. As IoT based systems require continuous internet connectivity, the WiFi access points must always be up and available. In case the APs are temporarily down due to power failure or maintenance, time stamped occupancy data collected from the past can be used to make some predictions, but at a loss of accuracy. Hence, all the devices in a home network must have sufficient power back up to ensure that they are discoverable in the network. This also reiterates the need for renewable energy sources in a HEMS, as they provide surplus energy supply. 6.6 Data collection Occupancy detection is generally a classification problem while most of the present day localization techniques are based on fingerprinting. These approaches require a war-drive site survey and accurate ground truth collection. Though smart devices help in crowdsourcing based database construction, missing data and incorrect ground truth information due to negligence from the participant, can affect the quality of collected training data. Also the database must be reconstructed when the indoor infrastructure is changed. Thus, algorithms that can well adapt to such variations need to be designed. 6.7 Sensor deployment and maintenance cost Historically, human presence in a smart home has been detected using environmental, PIR, force or door contact sensors. These sensors must be regularly inspected to ensure reliable operation. Also, smart meters must be attached to the electrical appliances to continuously monitor their power consumption. Hence, the users must be ready to incur the installation and maintenance cost of these sensors. Designs that guarantee an adequate degree of accuracy with minimum number of sensors, can help to reduce the system cost. 6.8 Accuracy and user comfort For HVAC control, commercial buildings are generally divided into thermal zones and each zone may contain multiple rooms. In such a scenario, the prediction of a false positive event may not be very critical. This is because, the probability that all the rooms in the thermal zone will be unoccupied during working hours, is very low. But in a home environment HVAC systems are installed in a single room and false positives can result in HVAC systems being turned on unnecessarily. This will cost heavily on the user\u2019s electricity bill. False negatives, though not critical in terms of electricity consumption, can affect the comfort level of the inhabitants. Also RFID, ZigBee or Bluetooth based occupancy sensing techniques require wearable sensors to be attached to the user body throughout the localization process. This maybe uncomfortable to some users. Although WiFi based device free localization systems can achieve sub-meter level accuracy, detecting multiple occupants in a passive manner has remained a challenging problem. 6.9 Effect of environmental conditions Radio signal propagation is largely affected by the temperature and humidity of the ambient environment while obstructions cause signal attenuation and shadowing. This is a major challenge for wireless localization techniques based on received signal strength. Hence, the collected signal must be made noise-free to extract useful features from it. In case of passive occupancy detection, smart-meter based methods depend on the interaction of users with various electrical appliances. However the utilization of some of these equipments like air conditioners or heaters are subject to seasonal variations. The detection capability of environmental sensors are also prone to environmental dynamics. Thus, the accuracy of these techniques are subject to seasonal variations. 6.10 Energy efficiency and battery life Battery life of smart devices that are used for monitoring and control of the home appliances, will be affected as they require internet connectivity. If motion assisted localization algorithms are employed, frequent scanning of smart phone inertial sensors can also drain the device battery. Thus, algorithms that minimize sensor scanning frequency while maintaining optimum localization accuracy must be designed. 6.11 Device heterogeneity and WiFi sleep policy In order to save battery power mobile phone manufactures like iPhone employ WiFi sleep policies that turn off the connectivity with the access points once the device is locked. This process can hinder user tracking in localization systems that are based on WiFi signals. This suggest that the device\u2019s sleep and wake policies must be compromised so as to ensure that the active user\u2019s smart device is discoverable by the occupancy detection system. 6.12 Data security Leakage of sensitive personal information collected from several occupancy sensors, can hinder the wide scale adoption of residential energy management systems. As malicious attacks can occur at any layer in an IoT framework, data security is an important aspect of an IoT enabled HEMS. Blockchain technology when combined with IoT can offer a useful solution to the data authentication problem and enable secure energy related resource sharing among smart households in a micro-grid [164], [165]. Nevertheless, several challenges exist in integrating IoT with smart contracts, such as the selection of an appropriate consensus protocol. 7 Conclusion Indoor occupancy detection constitutes an inseparable part of any design which aims at energy conservation through demand modulated appliance operation. Various studies conducted in commercial and residential structures have reported energy savings between 10% and 40% with occupant centric appliance control. Real time occupancy and context monitoring can enhance the comfort of the occupants and reduce energy wastage due to negligence. An elaborate description of various active and passive occupancy detection and localization technologies suitable for any HEMS has been presented in this paper. While wireless technologies like RFID, Bluetooth, ZigBee and WiFi can render median to very high detection accuracy through active or passive user participation, alternate sensing methodologies employing smart meters and environmental sensors still remain a less explored realm. As urban households are equipped with WiFi routers for internet connectivity, WiFi based device free human occupancy sensing is an attractive and affordable choice to develop an occupant centric IoT enabled HEMS network. Many global companies have withdrawn from the HEMS market due to low acceptance rate of the available technologies. Hence numerous challenges have been addressed so as to reduce the cost of these designs while maintaining satisfactory accuracy. The primary challenge in an occupant centric HEMS design is to achieve adequate performance with limited hardware resources, thereby reducing installation and runtime costs. Data privacy is also of utmost importance during the operational stage, to prevent unintended data leaks at any stage of the IoT network. Research in this area is still in the nascent phase and the emerging IoT revolution can offer viable solutions through seamless connectivity and massive computational power.

        "dc:description": "Smart scheduling of domestic appliances based on user demand is an important aspect of any home energy management system. Such a demand driven operation can be performed only by accurately detecting the presence and the location of users in their residence. IoT and other enabling technologies can transform a smart home into an energy aware entity by judicious utilization of the available data. This paper presents a survey of various occupancy detection and localization schemes and evaluates them on the basis of various factors that decide their suitability for home energy management system. Wireless technologies have been historically employed for detecting unknown targets in indoor environments. The pervasiveness of WiFi access points in urban buildings render it as a preferred candidate for occupancy detection and localization. Design of device-free sensing techniques, using commercially available WiFi routers can offer an affordable solution with minimum disturbance to the inhabitants. Detection accuracy maybe enhanced by combining wireless techniques with smartphone inertial sensors and other passive detection schemes that utilize smart energy meters or environmental sensors. In contrast to commercial buildings, several challenges must be addressed for occupancy detection in home energy management system. The impact of these design challenges are investigated and feasible solutions are suggested.",
