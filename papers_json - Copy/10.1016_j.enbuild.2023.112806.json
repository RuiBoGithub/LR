Fault impact analysis is an important phase of fault detection and diagnosis (FDD), enabling prioritization of the faults detected and allocation of resources to procure services and materials. However, many existing fault impact analysis workflows rely on building performance simulation (BPS) models with high engineering cost, limiting their use in FDD software. To this end, this paper introduces an inverse greybox model-based fault impact analysis method using building automation system (BAS) trend data from variable air volume (VAV) air handling unit (AHU) systems to quantify the heating and cooling energy impact of control system faults. It trains inverse models of a VAV AHU system by employing a sequential parameter estimation algorithm, formulates virtual meters quantifying the sensible heat transfer rate from AHU heating and cooling coils and the perimeter heating devices, and employs the virtual meters to estimate heating and cooling energy use of an existing VAV AHU system and the same system after fault correction. The method was used with a synthetic BAS dataset generated by using an EnergyPlus model of a 26-zone VAV AHU system in Ottawa, Canada. The results indicate that the virtual meters could estimate the monthly energy use for heating and cooling at a coefficient of variation of the root mean squared error (CV(RMSE)) of 4\u20136%. The method was demonstrated with measured BAS data from a 72-zone VAV AHU system, revealing an energy savings potential of 43% for heating and 22% for cooling through fault correction.

The controls hardware faults (i.e., hard faults) emerge, accumulate, and affect performance, as sensors and actuators age during the service life of a building. On the other hand, programming logic faults (i.e., soft faults) arise due to human errors in the initial design and implementation of sequences of operation as well as due to ad hoc overrides during operation [2]. Notably, sequences of operation are often custom-designed and -implemented as unique controller programs for each large commercial building project. Design and implementation of these programs are seldom accompanied with rigorous quality control procedures [3]; and, commissioning is limited to ensuring that sensors and actuators are installed and respond correctly as individual entities \u2013 not collectively as a complete system [4]. As a result, aside from hard faults, programming logic faults are also widespread in existing buildings. They create suboptimal operating conditions such as simultaneous heating and cooling, improper economizer sequence, fan speed modulation errors, and equipment staging and control loop tuning issues [5]. In the last three decades, fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) for HVAC systems has emerged as a field of research broadly studying methods to optimize a building\u2019s operation by continuously correcting its faults. FDD algorithms have been classified into three categories as quantitative, qualitative, and process history-based methods [6,7]. Quantitative methods employ detailed physics-based models acting as performance benchmarks. Due to their relatively higher engineering cost, examples of quantitative FDD methods are rather sparse in the literature [8,9]. Qualitative methods are rulesets with expert defined thresholds. Schein et al. [10,11]\u2019s air handling unit (AHU) performance assessment rules and variable air volume (VAV) terminal unit performance assessment control charts are two well-known examples of qualitative FDD methods. Qualitative FDD methods have been criticized for generating too many false positives, while still missing some faults [12,13]. This is likely because these rules operate as independent entities without fully capturing system to zone level interactions. For example, AHU level faults may trigger zone level fault alarms. Similarly, zone level faults (e.g., rogue zones with faulty temperature sensors) may cause the whole VAV AHU system to operate inappropriately [14]. The difficulty to capture such hierarchical interactions with expert rulesets has been widely recognized [15]. Process history-based methods that utilize data-driven models (i.e., inverse models) enable systematic assimilation of building automation system (BAS) trend data. FDD rules derived upon these data-driven models are considered superior to qualitative rulesets with expert defined thresholds [16]. Currently, process history-based FDD methods represent the majority of papers in the FDD literature. In these papers, a wide range of data-driven modelling techniques have been employed, including blackbox (e.g., neural network, support vector machine, principal component analysis) and greybox (e.g., thermal resistance\u2013capacitance network) models [17]. Parallel to research to develop more accurate and robust FDD algorithms, commercialization efforts are well underway. In 2017, Granderson et al. [18] reviewed 14 different commercially available FDD software solutions. Of them, 12 employed qualitative FDD algorithms. A few FDD software vendors reported supplementing their qualitative rulesets with quantitative and process history-based methods. ASHRAE Guideline 36 [19] provides a list of faulty operating conditions, which is an important step towards the standardization of FDD methods employed by commercial FDD solutions. Another important related effort aims to standardize the BAS metadata mapping process [20,21]. Notably, deployment of FDD solutions requires correctly mapping many BAS data streams. Currently, this points mapping process is a tedious manual process, as most existing buildings do not follow a standard BAS data labelling schema [22]. Therefore, standardization of BAS data tagging is a critical step to reduce the deployment costs for commercial FDD solutions, ultimately making them a plug-and-play technology. A weakness reported by the users of FDD solutions is the lack of realistic estimates for the energy and cost savings potential [23]. Building owners need to triage the faults detected and allocate resources to procure services and materials from appropriate trades [17]. This situation highlights the necessity to conduct fault impact analysis. 1.1 Literature review One of the main areas of activity in developing fault impact analysis methods has been to formulate models representing the behaviour of HVAC systems, components, and devices in the presence of common faults in building energy models [24]. Examples include models for compressor valve leakages [25], coil fouling [26,27], coil valve failures [28], leaking mixing box dampers [29], and thermostats and humidistat biases [26]. These fault models were intended for use within building performance simulation (BPS) tools such as EnergyPlus, TRNSYS, Modelica, and HVACSIM+. At first, researchers incorporated these models into BPS models through custom codes. For example, Wang and Hong [30] incorporated custom fault models into EnergyPlus via its Energy Management System (EMS) application environment. Padilla and Choinière [31] incorporated fault models by using the Modelica buildings library [32]. Pourarian [33] and Khire and Marija [34] implemented fault models into the BPS tools HVACSIM+ and TRNSYS, respectively. Subsequently, some fault modelling capabilities were incorporated as native objects into prominent BPS tools. For example, EnergyPlus v22.1 contains many of the HVAC fault models from the literature. Further, advanced custom fault modelling capabilities have been enabled through EnergyPlus via its Python EMS environment. Li and O\u2019Neill [24] identified two main applications for having fault models in BPS tools. Firstly, BPS tools offer a sandbox environment for the development and testing of FDD algorithms. For example, both faults and FDD algorithms can be implemented into the EMS environment of EnergyPlus [35]. Doing so would enable finetuning parameters of an FDD algorithm before deployment in real-world. Secondly, BPS tools offer an environment to study the impact of faults on energy and comfort performance. For example, Zhang and Hong [26] demonstrated the energy impact of outdoor air temperature sensor bias, zone temperature and humidity sensor bias, and fouling air filter faults for five different climate zones using a generic EnergyPlus model. Li and O\u2019Neill [36] introduced a comprehensive fault impact analysis framework. They employed EnergyPlus simulations of the US DOE prototype medium office model involving 129 fault modes and 41 fault models in four US climate zones. The study ranked fault types in terms of their impact on energy use. Another study was conducted to quantify the impact of faults in secondary schools in the US [37]. More recently, Lu et al. [29] studied the energy impact of 359 unique fault scenarios on Guideline 36 [19] sequences of operation. They used the US DOE prototype medium office model implemented in Modelica. Representing faults in BPS models is critical to acquire a high-level understanding of the significance of various faults for different archetypes in different climates. However, it does not address FDD vendors\u2019 need for building-specific fault impact analysis. Developing custom BPS-models for each building is cumbersome and impractical for FDD software developers. Surrogate models for fault impact analysis trained from many BPS simulations could practically rectify this problem [38]. However, to date, a surrogate model tailored to this application has yet to be developed. A promising alternative to fault impact analysis through BPS models is virtual meters employing inverse greybox models trained with BAS data [39]. For example, Darwazeh et al. [40] demonstrated that even a simple resistor\u2013capacitor (1R1C) thermal network model acting as a virtual meter is capable of estimating the thermal energy transfer from hydronic perimeter heating devices. Darwazeh et al.\u2019s virtual meters were compared to physical submeters deployed at each perimeter heating device. It was concluded that virtual meters could estimate the daily thermal energy output from hydronic perimeter heating devices at a normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE) of 16\u201318 %. In other studies, virtual meters that can accurately estimate the thermal energy added/extracted by AHU heating and cooling coils [41], water flow rate in AHU heating and cooling coils [42], and electricity consumed by fans, pumps, and condensers [43] have been developed. Simply put, virtual meters have been employed to predict energy consumption of an existing HVAC system from inverse models trained with BAS trend data. The existing system may contain one or more faults. However, fault impact analysis requires inverse models behind these virtual meters to be simulated to find out what the system\u2019s energy use would be if it could follow fault-free sequences of operation. The ability to simulate an existing system\u2019s fault-free version with inverse greybox models, in lieu of BPS models, would eliminate the aforementioned scalability issues. However, inverse model-based virtual meters have not been used in fault impact analysis in the literature. 1.2 Motivation and objectives Inverse greybox modelling has been successfully employed in virtual meters for different end-uses. The inverse models also enable simulating the fault-free version of an existing system\u2019s operation. Therefore, inverse model-based virtual meters can help estimate the energy impact of faults in a specific HVAC system and prioritize and schedule operation and maintenance tasks. To this end, this paper brings together inverse greybox model-based virtual meters for multiple zone VAV AHU systems from the literature [40,41] as a framework to quantify the energy impact of hard and soft faults. The practical advantage of using virtual meters derived upon inverse greybox models for fault impact analysis in lieu of BPS models is that it largely eliminates the engineering cost to assemble a custom BPS model. The proposed method is entirely data-driven and has been compiled as a function which merely requires BAS data input in a certain format (the function is made available along with sample data [44]). In this regard, the proposed method differs from existing fault impact analysis approaches in the literature, which rely on operational faults implemented into EnergyPlus or other BPS environments. Inverse greybox model-based virtual metering techniques have yet to be commercially adopted for fault impact analysis. The novelty of this paper is in developing an entirely data-driven fault impact analysis approach largely eliminating the engineering time and knowledge required to build BPS models for each system studied. The main objective is to introduce a purely BAS trend data-driven method for building-specific fault impact analysis. The method is intended to be incorporated within FDD software tools to enhance their predictions for the energy savings potential through the correction of detected faults. The method is developed by using a synthetic BAS dataset generated from an EnergyPlus model of an academic office building served by a multi-zone VAV AHU system. The accuracy of the virtual meters is verified by comparing them to the EnergyPlus meters for heating and cooling rate for AHU heating and cooling coils, and perimeter heating devices. Simply put, EnergyPlus is merely used as a high-fidelity simulation environment and as a reference point for comparison for the heating and cooling load predictions of the method prior to application using real BAS data. It is then demonstrated with BAS trend data extracted from an actual 72-zone VAV AHU system located in Ottawa, Canada. The savings predicted through fault correction are associated with physical hard and soft faults detected in this system. The method is compiled as a standalone Matlab function and made available with sample data as supplementary files along with this publication [44]. The scope of this paper is limited to the use of inverse greybox model-based virtual meters for estimation of existing and corrected (i.e., fault-free) sensible heating and cooling loads in a multiple zone VAV AHU system. 2 Methodology Fig. 1 presents a high-level structure of the inverse model-based virtual metering method for fault impact analysis. The method inputs hourly weather data and BAS trend data from a multiple zone VAV AHU system and generates hourly heating and cooling load profiles of the existing system and a fault-free version of it. While faults have an impact on the fan electricity use as well, the scope of this work is limited to the impact of faults on heating and cooling end-uses. Details of the input data are provided in Subsection 2.1. First, inverse greybox models representing each VAV zone and the AHU are created, as explained in Subsection 2.2. Virtual meters for perimeter heating devices and AHU heating and cooling coils are formulated as explained in Subsection 2.3. These virtual meters are used to estimate the hourly sensible heating and cooling rate of an existing VAV AHU system. The inverse models are then coupled with fault-free controllers (modified from ASHRAE Guideline 36) to estimate the hourly sensible heating and cooling rate of the fault-free version of the same VAV AHU system. These controllers are explained in Subsection 2.4. In addition, inverse models are trained with BAS trend data from a VAV AHU system in which hard faults may be present (e.g., certain zones may have reheat coils with a stuck open valve, and some others may have a faulty VAV terminal unit damper). Thus, before simulating these inverse models with the fault-free controllers, a version of the inverse models free from hard faults needs to be created. This process is also explained in Subsection 2.4. The method is compiled into a standalone Matlab function [44] to execute the tasks encircled with the dashed line in Fig. 1 automatically. 2.1 Input data The function requires seven BAS trend data types at the AHU level: supply air temperature (Tsa ), return air temperature (Tra ), heating coil valve position (shc ), cooling coil valve position (scc ), mixing box damper position (smb,dp ), supply fan state (sfan ), and supply air pressure (Psa ). In addition, three BAS trend data types are required from each VAV zone: indoor temperature (Tin ), VAV discharge airflow rate (qvav ), and VAV discharge airflow setpoint (qvav,sp ). A fourth BAS trend data type is required from each zone with a perimeter heating device, representing the perimeter heating valve position (sprm ). Fig. 2 presents these points on a generic multiple zone VAV AHU system. The two types of weather inputs are also used: outside air temperature (Toa ) and global horizontal solar radiation (Qsol ). These two can be queried from different solar and meteorological data providers. Herein, the authors used the NASA Power API given the latitude, longitude, and time interval [45]. The function also requires a few user inputs: the minimum mixing box damper position setpoint (smb,dp, min -sp ), a binary seasonal availability indicator where zero means heating and cooling are available year-round and one means heating is available from October to April and cooling is available from May to September, scheduled start and stop times of the system, a binary weekend availability indicator where one means the system is available in the weekend and zero it is not, and default heating and cooling temperature setpoints during occupied and unoccupied operating modes. 2.1.1 Validation with data synthetically generated using an EnergyPlus model The accuracy of the inverse models and virtual meters was tested by comparing their ability to replicate a high fidelity VAV AHU system model built in EnergyPlus. Simply put, the EnergyPlus model was used to generate the synthetic BAS trend data, which is then used as input to the fault impact analysis function. The EnergyPlus meters for the sensible heat transfer rate from the AHU heating and cooling coils and the perimeter heating devices were then compared with the predictions of the fault impact analysis function to quantify accuracy. To this end, a model of a 26-zone VAV AHU system with hydronic perimeter heating was built in the BPS tool EnergyPlus (see Fig. 3 ). The VAV AHU system serves the top floor of an academic office building in Ottawa, Canada. The south and east walls, indicated with dashed lines in Fig. 3, and the floor were treated as adiabatic surfaces because they represent boundaries adjacent to other conditioned indoor spaces. The floor geometry, envelope, and HVAC system properties were taken from the design drawings. The cooling coil was available from May to September, and the heating coil was available from October to April. The AHU was scheduled available from 6 am to 6 pm on both weekdays and weekends. The zone temperature setpoint was 22 °C in the winter and 23.5 °C in the summer. Outside scheduled operating hours a temperature setpoint of 15 °C and 30 °C was maintained in the heating and cooling seasons, respectively. The minimum mixing box damper position setpoint was 43 % (as indicated in the design drawings). Occupant count data were generated using one-year of Wi-Fi device count and motion detector data and the sensor fusion approach described in Hobson et al. [46]. The lighting power density for each zone was set to 8 W/m2 [47] during occupied hours only. The plug-in equipment electricity use was set to 100 W per person during occupied hours, which was reduced to 75 W per person after-hours on workdays, and 50 W per person during weekends [48]. The EnergyPlus model was then used to generate the BAS data required for the method. In addition, the EnergyPlus model was utilized to generate hourly sensible heating and cooling energy transfer rates from the AHU heating and cooling coils, and the perimeter heating devices. The inverse model-based virtual metering results were compared to EnergyPlus meter outputs to quantify their accuracy. To this end, two statistical error metrics were used: the coefficient of variation of the root mean squared error (CV(RMSE)) and the normalized mean bias error (NBME). The CV(RMSE) is calculated as follows: (1) CV ( R M S E ) = ∑ i n y i - y ^ i 2 n y ¯ where y (kW) is the reference values for heating or cooling loads (herein acquired either through a high fidelity EnergyPlus model), y ^ (kW) is the predicted heating or cooling loads, i is the index number of heating or cooling load data, n is the number of data points in the dataset, and y ¯ (kW) is the mean of the reference heating or cooling load data record. The NMBE is calculated as follows: (2) NMBE = ∑ i n y i - y ^ i n y ¯ ASHRAE Guideline 14 [49] defines acceptable CV(RMSE) and NMBE thresholds as 15 % and 5 %, respectively, for monthly data and 30 % and 10 %, respectively, for hourly data. In this paper, we used these thresholds to interpret the accuracy of the virtual metering algorithms. 2.1.2 Demonstration of the method with data from a real VAV AHU system After validation with simulation data, the method was demonstrated with measured data from a 72-zone VAV AHU system located in an academic office building in Ottawa, Canada. The minimum mixing box damper position setpoint was 10 %. The heating and cooling temperature setpoints were 22 °C and 23.5 °C, respectively. The unoccupied heating and cooling temperature setpoints were 18 °C and 27 °C, respectively. The AHU was scheduled on between 8 am and 8 pm both weekdays and weekends. The system received hot water from a central heating plant from October to April, and chilled water from an on-site cooling plant between May and September. The points listed in Fig. 2 were downloaded from the cloud-based BAS data storage system at hourly intervals between June 1, 2017, and May 31, 2018. 2.2 Inverse model for the VAV AHU system The VAV AHU system is assembled from AHU and zone models previously developed [16,40,41]. The AHU model predicts the supply air temperature as follows: (3) T sa = T ma + Δ T hc + Δ T cc + Δ T fan where T (°C) is the air temperature and ΔT (°C) is the temperature change across an AHU component. The subscripts ma, hc, cc, and fan represent mixed air, heating coil, cooling coil, and the supply fan, respectively. If the humidity ratios of outdoor and return air are close, Tma can be approximated as follows: (4) T ma = f oa ∙ T oa + 1 - f oa ∙ T ra where foa is the outdoor air fraction. If Tma is not monitored by a dedicated sensor, at timesteps when heating and cooling coil valves are both closed (i.e., ΔThc/cc = 0 °C), foa can be approximated as follows: (5) f oa = T sa - Δ T fan - T ra T oa - T ra The temperature rise across the fan is represented as a linear function of Psa (Pa) as follows [41,50]: (6) Δ T fan = P sa ∙ 1 ρ ∙ c p ∙ η where ρ (kg/m3) and c p (J/kg°C) are the density and specific heat of air, respectively. The term η is the fan total efficiency if the motor is not in the airstream. If the motor and transmission are in the airstream, η is the product of motor, transmission, and fan efficiencies. The AHU fans considered in this paper maintain a maximum Psa of ∼ 500 Pa. Using fan and motor efficiencies, the pressure rise across the fan at different loads from design specifications, and sfan trend data, the temperature rise across the fan was estimated between 0.5 and 0.8 °C. Recall that foa in Eqn. 5 represents an approximation for the outdoor air fraction at timesteps when the heating and cooling coil valves are closed. However, a regression model is still needed between the outdoor air fraction and mixing box damper position data records in order to estimate the outdoor air fraction at any mixing box damper position. With the foa values computed at many timesteps and the trend data for mixing box damper command signal smb,dp , a regression model for the relationship between foa and smb,dp could be developed. In this paper, the following exponential model form was used [16]: (7) f oa s mb , d p = x 1 , m b 1 + exp x 2 , m b ∙ s mb , d p + x 3 , m b where x represents the unknown parameters and the subscript mb stands for the mixing box. This regression model will be used in the AHU heating and cooling coil virtual meters (see Subsection 2.3). Developing virtual meters for the heat supplied by each perimeter heating device with only air-side measurements requires an inverse greybox model characterizing the thermal mass and resistance of each zone [40]. The authors employed a simple one resistance and one capacitance (1R1C) thermal model for each thermal zone, as this model formulation has been found acceptable for controls-oriented applications [40,51]. A VAV AHU system with n thermal zones would then be represented by a network of n resistances and n capacitances. The 1R1C model is represented in the following mathematical form: (8) C i d T in , i dt = T oa - T in , i ∙ 1 R i + Q misc , i + Q hvac , i where C (kJ/°C) and R (°C/kW) are two unknown parameters representing the thermal capacitance and resistance of zone i. Qmisc,i (kW) and Qhvac,i (kW) represent uncontrollable (i.e., disturbance) and controllable (i.e., HVAC) heat sources, respectively. The sensible thermal loads added/extracted to/from zone i by the HVAC systems (Qhvac,i ) are calculated as follows: (9) Q hvac , i = s prm , i ∙ Q prm , i + ρ air ∙ c air ∙ q vav , i 1000 ∙ T sa - T in , i where ρair (kg/m3) and cair (kJ/kg°C) are the density and specific heat of air. Recall that sprm,i (%) is the state of the perimeter heater, Tsa (°C) is the supply air temperature, and qvav,i (L/s) is the VAV discharge airflow rate. The parameter Q prm , i (kW) is an unknown regression coefficient representing the effective capacity of perimeter heaters in zone i. Note that the term ρ air ∙ c air ∙ q vav , i 1000 ∙ T sa - T in , i represents the sensible heat added by the VAV terminal Qvav,i . 2.2.1 Parameter estimation A challenge in estimating parameters of interest R, C, Qprm is the time-variant and stochastic nature of the disturbances Qmisc , which represent typically unmeasured quantities such as solar and casual heat gains induced by the occupant behaviour (e.g., lighting, plug-in-equipment, operable shade use). While it is reasonable to assume a time-invariant R and C for controls-oriented applications, Qmisc is expected to exhibit a significant daily and seasonal variation. Thus, global parameter estimation approaches assigning constant or steady-periodic values to Qmisc suffer from loss of accuracy [13,40]. A second limitation of global parameter estimation approaches is to discern the parameter estimates R and C, as these two parameters are not independent and the time-constant (i.e., R × C) governs the general temperature response. The authors attempt to rectify these limitations by partitioning the solution space into different intervals of interest, which lends itself to the estimation of the parameters one at a time. Simply put, the dataset is first partitioned into periods that enable direct estimation of the parameter C (i.e., instances at which a VAV terminal unit switches on). By isolating each VAV switch on instance individually, we could assume that the outdoor temperature just before and just after each event is constant. Thus, the change in temperature slope before and after each event could be exclusively attributed to the change in the heat delivered by the VAV terminal. This enabled us to estimate the parameter C first. Then, the estimate for parameter C is used during free-floating periods to determine the parameter R. Similarly, the estimates for parameters C and R are used at instances of perimeter heating device state change to determine the parameter for the perimeter heater capacity Qprm . Lastly, Qmisc is determined using the time-invariant parameters estimated previously R, C, and Qprm . First, the timesteps in which the heat added by the VAV terminal Qvav,i changes more than 0.5 kW and the perimeter heating devices are off are identified. Notably, the magnitude of this 0.5 kW threshold can be increased for buildings with large VAV terminals. Increasing this threshold will reduce the number of eligible timesteps for parameter estimation and decreasing it may induce insignificant temperature slope changes governed primarily by measurement error in lieu of physical processes. Thus, this value should be selected carefully, after conducting a sensitivity analysis by incrementally increasing it and comparing the parameter estimate C acquired each time. In this paper, this condition is typically the first timestep each morning in the summer, when the VAV terminal begins receiving cool supply air. An illustrative example is highlighted with a red filled circle symbol in Fig. 4 . Given a small timestep size of one hour or less, it can be assumed that the disturbances and indoor and outdoor temperature differences just before and at timestep k are equal (i.e., Qmisc,i,k-1 ≈ Qmisc,i,k, Toa,k-1 - Tin,i,k-1 ≈ Toa,k - Tin,i,k ). This leaves only the change in the heat delivered by the VAV terminal between tk -1 and tk to explain the change in the indoor temperature change rate. Thus, the value of thermal capacitance at timestep k (Ck ) can then be estimated as follows: (10) C i , k = Q vav , i , k - Q vav , i , k - 1 T in , i , k + 1 - T in , i , k Δ t - T in , i , k - T in , i , k - 1 Δ t Note that the parenthetical terms in the denominator T in , i , k - T in , i , k - 1 Δ t and T in , i , k + 1 - T in , i , k Δ t represent the rate of change in the indoor temperature before and after the VAV switch on event at timestep k, respectively. These temperature slopes are illustrated in Fig. 4 with thick red lines extending before and after the event. The term in the numerator ( Q vav , i , k - Q vav , i , k - 1 ) represents the change in the cooling rate by the VAV terminal due to the switch on event at timestep k. The change in Qvav at timestep k is also illustrated with an example shown in Fig. 4. Note that Ci,k is estimated for each suitable timestep k (i.e., when Qvav,i changes more than 0.5 kW and the perimeter heating devices are off) for each zone i. Due to potential measurement and modelling error, C estimates for zone i at each suitable timestep k are expected to be somewhat different. Thus, the median value for individual Ci,k estimates will be used by the virtual metering algorithms (i.e., median of C values estimated at different timesteps). The authors selected the median, instead of mean, of this parameter to reduce the potential impact of outliers. We also defined a wide search range of 100 kJ/°C to 10,000 kJ/°C for the Ci,k values. For the ease of interpretation, this range corresponds to having a thermal mass equivalent to approximately 50 kg to 5000 kg of concrete actively participating to the primary thermal response of a zone. To eliminate the effect of outliers, timesteps yielding unreasonable Ci,k values are removed from further analysis. Once the thermal capacitance of a zone Ci is estimated, the thermal resistance Ri can be estimated by identifying time intervals when qvav,i and sprm,i are both zero, Toa is less than 0 °C, and Qsol is 0 W/m2 for at least four hours continuously. Cold outdoor temperatures when the solar irradiance is zero are selected to ensure that heat transfer through the envelope is the governing factor defining the temperature change rate. Fig. 5 presents an illustrative example for a period that fulfill these conditions. Note that the term Qhvac,i in Eqn. 8 is zero during these periods. Further, because these periods correspond to unoccupied hours after sunset in winter, Qmisc,i is assumed constant. Given Ci is known, Qhvac,i is zero, and Qmisc,i is constant over these periods, the unknown parameter Ri in Eqn. 8 can be solved by the least-squares method. The third step in zone model identification is to determine the perimeter heater capacity Qprm,i for each zone. To this end, time steps at which the perimeter heating devices switch on are identified. The effect of the thermal mass of a perimeter heating device itself is minimized by focussing on periods during which the heater is off for at least one hour and once it turns on, it stays on for at least an hour continuously. Fig. 5 presents an example of one such instance. Assuming that disturbances and temperature difference between indoors and outdoors do not change just before and after a timestep of interest (tk ) (i.e., Qmisc,i,k-1 = Qmisc,i,k, Toa,k-1 - Tin,i,k-1 = Toa,k - Tin,i,k ), the general model introduced in Eqns. (8\u20139) can be discretized and restructured to enable estimation of Qprm,i : (11) Q prm , i , k = C i , k ∙ T in , i , k + 1 - T in , i , k Δ t - T in , i , k - T in , i , k - 1 Δ t - Q vav , i , k - Q vav , i , k - 1 s prm , i , k - s prm , i , k - 1 Similar to the estimation of thermal capacitance, acknowledging potential measurement and modelling errors, Qprm estimate for zone i at each suitable timestep is expected to be different. Thus, the median value for individual Qprm estimates will be used by the virtual metering algorithms. Once the time-invariant parameters of the zone model defined in Eqn. (8) (i.e., R, C, Qprm ) are determined, the time-variant parameter Qmisc can be determined. Simply put, because the thermal energy stored/released by the capacitance term ( C i d T in , i dt ), the heat exchange between indoors and outdoors ( T oa - T in , i ∙ 1 R i ) , and heat added/removed by the VAV terminal and the perimeter heating devices (Qhvac,i ) can be calculated for every timestep, the remainder (Qmisc,i ) can be determined as the value sustaining the mathematical equality in Eqn. (8) at each timestep. Qmisc,i values that are more than three median absolute deviations from the median are considered as outliers. The outliers were replaced by linear interpolation of neighbouring, non-outlier values by using Matlab\u2019s filloutlier function. Notably, the sequential parameter estimation algorithm presented here differs from others using thermal network models (e.g., [13,40,51]) in that it yields a time-variant Qmisc term instead of a time-invariant one. Partitioning the dataset into unique short intervals where a constant Qmisc assumption holds true enabled estimation of time-invariant parameters C, R, and Qprm one by one without forcing an inappropriate constant or steady-periodic Qmisc parameter globally. Table 1 presents a pseudocode summarizing the sequential zone model parameter estimation process introduced in this paper. 2.3 Virtual meters Four virtual meters using four inverse model parameters (x 1-3 ,mb in Eqn. (7) and Qprm ,i in Eqn. (11)) are used to estimate the sensible heat injected by the AHU heating and cooling coils and the perimeter heating devices. The AHU heating coil virtual meter estimates the sensible heat transfer from an AHU heating coil as follows: (12) Q htg , a h u = T sa - x 1 , m b 1 + exp x 2 , m b ∙ s mb , d p + x 3 , m b ∙ T oa + 1 - x 1 , m b 1 + exp x 2 , m b ∙ s mb , d p + x 3 , m b ∙ T ra - Δ T fan ∙ ∑ i n q vav , i ∙ ρ air ∙ c air ∙ s hc > 0 Note that the first parenthetical term represents the temperature rise/drop between the supply and mixed air temperatures after removing the effect of temperature rise across the supply fan. The second parenthetical term is the total air mass flow rate received by the n VAV terminals multiplied by the specific heat of air. For simplicity, the density and the specific heat of air are assumed to be 1.2 kg/m3 and 1 kJ/kg°C. The third parenthetical term is a logical operator that yields zero if the heating coil valve is fully closed and otherwise one. Similarly, the AHU cooling coil virtual meter estimates the sensible heat transfer from an AHU cooling coil as follows: (13) Q clg , a h u = T sa - x 1 , m b 1 + exp x 2 , m b ∙ s mb , d p + x 3 , m b ∙ T oa + 1 - x 1 , m b 1 + exp x 2 , m b ∙ s mb , d p + x 3 , m b ∙ T ra - Δ T fan ∙ ∑ i n q vav , i ∙ ρ air ∙ c air ∙ s cc > 0 Eqn. (13) is identical to Eqn. (12) with the exception that the last parenthetical term is a logical operator using the cooling coil state instead of the heating coil state. The perimeter heater virtual meters provide an estimate of the sensible heat transfer from the perimeter heating device in a zone (Qhtg,prm ,i) as follows: (11) Q htg , p r m , i = Q prm , i ∙ s prm , i Recall that Qprm ,i (kW) is the perimeter heater capacity of zone i which was estimated as explained in Table 1. In addition to the four inverse model parameters (x 1-3 ,mb in Eqn. (7) and Qprm ,i in Eqn. (11)), the virtual meters presented in Eqns. (12 to 14) require the following inputs: Tsa , Tra , Toa , Psa , smb,dp , qvav ,i, sprm ,i, shc , and scc. The energy use of an existing VAV AHU system can be estimated by simply using the historical trend data for these variables. However, energy use of a fault-free system requires simulating the inverse models developed with best-practice sequences of operation. 2.4 Estimating fault-free system\u2019s energy use Zone and AHU controllers are defined to estimate the fault-free behaviour of the VAV AHU system represented by the inverse models introduced in Subsection 2.2. While simulating the fault-free behaviour, these controllers determine several of the input variables for the inverse models and the virtual meters. Fig. 6 provides an overview of the interactions between the controllers and the inverse models. The models input controlled inputs u and disturbances d, and emulate the controlled variables y. Zone and AHU controllers communicate to determine the trim & response behaviour for system-level controlled variables. Guideline 36 [19] definitions for state of operation, mode of operation, supply air temperature (SAT) setpoint and supply airflow setpoint reset formed the basis of the controllers used in the fault impact analysis function. The zone controller for zone i aims to maintain the user defined occupied and unoccupied mode temperature setpoints by modulating the VAV airflow rate for zone i between the minimum and maximum VAV airflow setpoints and the perimeter heating device valve between 0 % and 100 % (see Fig. 7 (a)). The minimum and maximum VAV airflow setpoint values are inferred from the input trend data qvav,sp ,i for each zone. If the control error of zone i is less than −1°C, a request to increase the SAT is sent to the AHU controller. If the control error of zone i exceeds 1 °C, a request to decrease the SAT is generated. If these 1 °C control error thresholds are violated outside scheduled operating hours, a wake-up request is sent to the AHU controller. As illustrated in Fig. 6, the model of zone i is invoked with the controlled variables uzn ,i (qvav,sp ,i and sprm ,i) and disturbance dzn ,i (Toa , Qmisc ,i, Tsa ). Note that while Tsa is a controlled variable for the AHU controller, it is treated as a disturbance for the zone controller. While the disturbances of a zone model remain constant for an hour, the zone model generates predictions of the zone temperature at one-minute intervals subject to varying uzn ,i. The process is repeated for all zones in a VAV AHU system. The AHU controller decreases the SAT value at a 0.5 °C/hour rate if the total number of SAT decrease requests exceeds the SAT increase requests. Similarly, the SAT value is increased at a 0.5 °C/hour rate if the total number of SAT increase requests exceeds the SAT decrease requests. The SAT values are confined by a lower and an upper limit at different outdoor temperatures (see Fig. 7(b) [52]). If a wake-up request persists over an hour for at least a single zone during unoccupied hours, the VAV AHU system enters the setup/setback mode and starts supplying conditioned air at SAT setpoint. The AHU supply airflow rate is set to the sum of the VAV discharge airflow setpoint values for all VAV terminals. The AHU controller also determines the state of operation. If the SAT setpoint is more than the mixed air temperature with smb,dp at its minimum position setpoint smb,dp, min -sp and the Toa is less than Tsa, the AHU operates in the heating state. In the heating state, Eqn. (12) calculates Qhtg,ahu . If the SAT setpoint is less than the mixed air temperature with smb,dp at smb,dp, min -s p and the Toa is less than Tsa, the AHU operates in the economizer state (Qhtg,ahu and Qclg,ahu are both zero). If Toa is less than Tra but more than the SAT setpoint, the AHU operates in the economizer with cooling state (Eqn. (13) calculates Qclg,ahu with smb,dp 100 % open). A maximum outdoor temperature of 20 °C is also introduced for the economizer with cooling state [53]. If Toa is more than both Tra and the SAT setpoint, the AHU operates in the cooling state (Eqn. (13) calculates Qclg,ahu with smb,dp at smb,dp, min -sp ). If the AHU mixing box damper to foa behaviour is outside the acceptable range for parallel blade dampers per AMCA [54] (i.e., faulty mixing box damper actuators), the faulty dampers are assumed to be replaced with a healthy damper following the authority 50 % curve to simulate the fault-free sequences of operation. 3 Results and discussion The results and discussion section first presents the analysis with synthetic BAS data generated from the EnergyPlus model described in Section 2.1.1. Because the perimeter heating devices are hard-sized, the simulation data enable us to verify the accuracy of the zone model parameters. Further, the virtual meter-based energy use estimates for heating and cooling are then compared with appropriate EnergyPlus meter outputs. Thus, the authors could quantify the accuracy of the virtual meters. Subsequently, the fault impact analysis tool is employed on the data from a real VAV AHU system (described in Section 2.1.2). Hourly heating and cooling end-uses for existing and fault-free operation of the system are presented. Existing and fault-free operating conditions are compared to interpret the changes in the heating and cooling energy use patterns. Lastly, unresolved issues regarding the fault impact analysis tool are identified, highlighting future research and development needs. 3.1 Analysis with the synthetic BAS data The results of the analysis with synthetic BAS data, which was generated from the EnergyPlus model presented in Section 2.1.1, are presented in two parts: inverse modelling results and verification of the virtual meters. 3.1.1 Inverse modelling results Fig. 8 presents the mixing box model (see Eqn. 7) trained with the synthetic BAS dataset. The results highlight that the relationship between the mixing box damper and outdoor air fraction is within the expected range for parallel blade dampers [54], which is indicated with the green shaded region in the figure. The model could also capture this behaviour accurately. The trained regression model, represented with a solid red line in the figure, was in the following functional form f oa s mb , d p = 1.338 1 + exp - 3.149 ∙ s mb , d p + 2.075 , and could fit the scatter points with an R2 value of 0.99. The figure presents mixing box damper position data equal or greater than 43 % because that is the minimum mixing box damper position setpoint for this VAV AHU system. Fig. 9 presents examples for the inverse modelling results for three of the 26 zones of the VAV AHU system simulated in EnergyPlus. The room IDs are annotated in the figure. The position and orientation of these rooms on the floor plate are shown in Fig. 3. Of them, zone 11 is a highly-glazed corner office with northwest- and southwest-facing facades, and zones 19 and 25 are two core spaces. Upon presenting the inverse modelling results in detail for these three representative spaces, an overview of the inverse modelling results for all 26 zones is provided in Fig. 10 . The boxplots of the top row shown in Fig. 9 present the distribution of thermal mass/capacitance parameter C at each timestep when the heat added by the zone\u2019s VAV terminal changed significantly in the summer (see Eqn. (10)). While the C estimates on different dates were tightly distributed in zones 11 and 25, there was a significant variation in zone 19. Further, the estimates for parameter C were significantly larger for zone 19 than for zones 11 and 25. This is expected because zone 19 is substantially larger than zones 11 and 25 (see Fig. 3). Each scatter point shown in the second row of Fig. 9 presents the heat release rate by the thermal mass and the temperature difference between indoors and outdoors at timesteps when the zone perimeter heating device and AHU fan were both off overnight in the winter. As explained in Subsection 2.2., the slope of the line-fit through the scatter points provides an estimate of the thermal transmittance (i.e., the reciprocal of the parameter R). Notably, the scatter plots for all three rooms were somewhat noisy, yielding line-fits with R 2 values between 0.43 and 0.58. Possible reasons include the choice of a relatively large timestep size of 60-min to address concerns of scalability to buildings, non-constant overnight Qmisc values varying throughout the year, and errors associated with the estimated C values. However, note that the timestep size was determined after a sensitivity analysis with the BAS trend data at 15-min and 60-min timesteps. After confirming that the results were in agreement, the fault impact analysis function was compiled to work with hourly data to ensure transferability to buildings where trend data are sampled at low temporal resolution. The boxplots of the third row of Fig. 9 present the distribution of perimeter heater capacity parameter Qprm at each timestep when the perimeter heater is switched on (see Eqn. (11)). The Qprm estimates exhibited a significant variation on some days, though the lower and upper quartiles were close in all three zones. The contributing factors to this variation are likely related to the thermal mass of perimeter heating devices and variations in the hot water temperature. Recall that the inverse models for each zone were comprised of three time-invariant parameters (C, R, and Qprm ), and a time-variant parameter Qmisc . Hence, the Qmisc term exhibited a day-to-day variation subject to day-to-day changes in solar and casual heat gains. The last row of Fig. 9 presents the Qmisc estimates for the 25th and 75th percentile weekday profiles. Notably, zones 19 and 25 do not have exterior windows, while zone 11 is a highly glazed corner office. Thus, the estimated Qmisc profiles are distinctively different in zone 11, whereby the behaviour is driven by the solar heat gains. Unlike zone 11, Qmisc behaviour can be attributed to the stochastic occupancy, lighting and plug load use patterns defined in the EnergyPlus model. Fig. 10 presents the distribution of the C and R estimates for each of the 26 zones (i.e., each box-whisker plot contains 26 values). The results indicate that the C values for individual zones range from 400 kJ/°C to 6500 kJ/°C. The outliers were the four largest zones (i.e., zone 12, 19, 21, and 26). The R estimates for individual zones ranged from 0.2 °C/W to 0.34 °C/W. Zones with large exterior window surface areas were identified as having smaller R estimates. More importantly, the scatter plot presents the actual and predicted Qprm values for each of the 26 zones. The actual values were extracted from the hard-sized EnergyPlus perimeter heater capacities for verification purposes. Notably, verification of the Qprm values is an important step because the process of estimating Qprm (explained in subsection 2.2) is dependent on having accurate R and C estimates. As shown in Fig. 10, the inverse modelling process was able to identify the Qprm values with an RMSE of 0.24 kW and a mean bias error (MBE) of 0.01 kW, meaning that the overall modelling process yields accurate and unbiased parameter estimates. 3.1.2 Verification of the virtual meters The accuracy of the virtual meters is quantified by comparing their predictions to the EnergyPlus meter outputs. To this end, sensible heat transfer rates from the AHU heating and cooling coils and the perimeter heating devices were extracted from the EnergyPlus model. Fig. 11 presents a comparison between these EnergyPlus meter outputs and those predicted by the virtual meters. For ease of interpretation, the figure presents data from July for the AHU cooling coil and from February for the AHU heating coil and perimeter heating devices. The figure also annotates the coefficient of variation of the RMSE (CV(RMSE)) and normalized mean bias error (NMBE) values for the monthly end-uses for the entire year. The results indicate that the CV(RMSE) and NMBE values were 4\u20136 % and 1\u20133 %, respectively. These metrics highlight that the inverse model-based virtual meters developed in this paper provide unbiased, accurate predictions of the major heating and cooling end-uses. Notably, CV(RMSE) and NMBE metrics both comply with ASHRAE Guideline 14 recommendations [49]. However, there were several visible differences between the AHU heating and cooling coils, which were concentrated at the beginning of the day. This is likely due to the fact that the virtual metering algorithms neglect the thermal mass of the heating and cooling coils. The effect of this simplification can be significant if the virtual meters are used to make subhourly load predictions while the heating and cooling coil valve positions are unstable between timesteps. However, as indicated by the low CV(RMSE) and NMBE values in Fig. 11, the virtual metering algorithms were able to attain accurate heating and cooling load predictions at lower temporal resolutions. Notably, these virtual meters are intended for fault impact analysis \u2013 i.e., for estimating the energy impact of faults over a year, not for estimating the subhourly heating and cooling loads. Thus, CV(RMSE) and NMBE metrics presented in the figure are computed in terms of the models\u2019 ability to estimate monthly heating and cooling energy use, not at hourly or subhourly resolutions. Simply put, as long as the virtual meters are capable of estimating the monthly heating and cooling energy use accurately, the inverse models are considered acceptable for fault impact analysis, despite occasionally over or under-estimating the hourly heating and cooling loads as shown in Fig. 11. 3.2 Demonstration with BAS data from a real VAV AHU system After the virtual meters\u2019 performance has been verified with synthetic BAS data generated from an EnergyPlus model, their use in fault impact analysis is demonstrated with data from a real VAV AHU system (the 72-zone VAV AHU system introduced in Subsection 2.1.2). The fault impact analysis function first estimates the inverse model parameters required by the virtual meters. The virtual meters presented in Subsection 2.3 are then used with existing trend data for Tsa , Tra , Toa , Psa , smb,dp , qvav ,i, sprm ,i, shc , and scc. This yields the heating and cooling load estimates for the existing system without fault correction (see Fig. 12 ). Subsequently, the trend data for the aforementioned variables are regenerated with fault-free sequences of operation as described in Subsection 2.4, and these variables are then used in the virtual meters to provide estimates for the heating and cooling loads after fault correction, also shown in Fig. 12. The results indicate that the AHU heating coils account for only about 4 % of the annual space heating needs for both existing and fault-free systems. However, a comparison between existing and fault-free states indicates that the total heating energy use was predicted to reduce by 43 % (from 67.4 MWh to 37.4 MWh) if the deficiencies in the sequences of operation were addressed. Fig. 13 provides an overview of the existing and fault-free operating conditions, respectively, to help interpret changes leading to this reduction in heating energy use. The results indicate that the existing system did not have an SAT setpoint reset logic and was maintaining the SAT at a constant 16 °C setpoint during the operating hours year-round. As a result, the VAV AHU system operated in the economizer state throughout the winter, when the average outdoor temperature was −7°C. This caused excessive outdoor airflow rates in the winter, leading to an increase in heating energy use. Similarly, the sensible heat transfer from the AHU cooling coil was predicted to reduce by 22 % (from 110 MWh to 85 MWh) after implementing fault-free sequences operation. This change can be partly attributed to a deficiency in the state of operation sequence. As shown in Fig. 14 , the existing VAV AHU system did not have the economizer with cooling state programmed correctly. The authors verified that the economizer was hardcoded to be available only when the outdoor air temperature was less than the SAT. In reality, this logic disregards the potential of outdoor air for free cooling when the outdoor temperature is above the SAT setpoint but still significantly less than the return air temperature. Simply put, the sequence did not take full advantage of the cool outdoor air to offset mechanical cooling needs. A second factor contributing to the reduction in space cooling loads is likely due to the anomalous behaviour of the mixing box dampers (see Fig. 15 ). Notably, the dampers could not sustain high outdoor air fractions and deviated outside the expected range of behaviour for parallel blade dampers [54], which is indicated by the green-shaded region in the figure. This factor also limits the VAV AHU system\u2019s ability to exploit outdoor air for free cooling, and increased reliance on mechanical cooling. Indoor temperature records in the winter indicate the outcomes of inappropriate zoning and VAV terminal sizing. The temperature responses of the zones were vastly different; a large number of zones were overheating, while many others required space heating. Combining zones of such diverse space heating/cooling needs under the same VAV AHU system introduces challenges in providing acceptable indoor temperatures. This is also evident with the minimal use of AHU heating coil. Traditionally, lowering SAT setpoints in the winter could eliminate overheating in the winter without creating overcooling. However, due to oversized VAV terminals with excessively high minimum airflow setpoints, lowering SAT setpoints led to overcooling in the existing system. Changes in the SAT setpoint reset scheme did not noticeably address this problem, as the underlying issue is related to inappropriate zoning and oversized VAV terminals. Such design faults are, however, beyond the scope of controls-oriented faults covered in this paper. 3.3 Unresolved issues The inverse greybox model-based fault impact analysis method introduced in this paper has several shortcomings. These shortcomings are listed here to highlight their potential practical implications and to develop future work recommendations. \u2022 The method enables studying the impact of HVAC faults on sensible heating and cooling energy use. Specifically, the latent portions of the heating and cooling energy are neglected. This was an outcome of an effort to minimize the number of BAS trend data types required to carry out a comprehensive fault impact analysis. VAV AHU systems in which relative humidity of return, outdoor, and supply air streams were monitored, the method could easily be modified to capture the latent portion of the heating and cooling energy use. The authors refrained from including these data types to maximize the transferability of the method to other building types. \u2022 The fault impact analysis method presented in this paper does not cover the impact of HVAC faults on electricity demand. For example, a faulty mode of operation sequence can cause fans to operate for longer hours and thus increase electricity consumption. Future work should expand the fault impact analysis to cover the impact on the fan and pump power. \u2022 While the general fault impact analysis approach is applicable to different VAV AHU configurations, the ones studied in this paper were limited to multiple-zone mixed-air single-duct VAV AHU systems without heat recovery. The authors focus on this configuration because of its widespread use in North America. However, future work should expand the fault impact analysis capabilities to other VAV AHU system configurations (e.g., dual-duct systems and systems with heat recovery). \u2022 The virtual meters developed in this paper have been validated through synthetic BAS data generated from EnergyPlus simulations. While the authors demonstrated the method with measured BAS data from a real VAV AHU system, the authors did not have access to high-resolution submeter data from this system for validation. A follow-up field study is needed to verify the method\u2019s accuracy on a real VAV AHU system. This field study should include a longitudinal measurement and verification stage to compare energy savings achieved to those predicted by the fault impact analysis tool. \u2022 The method developed in this study presents virtual meter-based heating and cooling energy use estimates of a VAV AHU system in its current state and if all its faults are addressed. In practice, the operational decision-makers may require the knowledge of savings achievable for addressing a subset of the faults. However, this need has not been considered in this paper and can be a topic for future research. \u2022 The fault impact analysis method has not been integrated into an FDD tool. Once this is done, the influence of fault impact analysis capabilities on the effectiveness of an FDD workflow can be examined. Future work is planned to conduct operator interviews to investigate the benefits of fault impact analysis in the fault correction process. 4 Conclusion and future work An inverse greybox model-based fault impact analysis method was developed to quantify the impact of multiple-zone single-duct VAV AHU control system faults on heating and cooling energy use. The method was compiled into a standalone Matlab function [44]. The function inputs several basic user inputs and commonly available BAS trend data types from multiple zone VAV AHU systems. It builds inverse models for each VAV zone and AHU. A novel sequential parameter estimation algorithm was introduced to estimate the known parameters of the zone models. The sequential parameter estimation algorithm presented here differs from the others in the literature in that it yields a time-variant disturbance term Qmisc , which represents the combined effect of the solar and casual heat gains, instead of a time-invariant one. The algorithm partitions the dataset into unique short intervals, which enable the estimation of time-invariant parameters (i.e., thermal mass and resistance, perimeter heater capacity) one by one without forcing an inappropriate constant or steady-periodic Qmisc parameter globally. By using the inverse model parameter estimates, the function then formulates virtual meters quantifying the sensible heat transfer rate from AHU heating and cooling coils, and the perimeter heating devices. It then employs the virtual meters to estimate heating and cooling energy use of the existing VAV AHU system and the same system after fault correction. To this end, it simulates a fault-free version of the VAV AHU system subject to ASHRAE Guideline 36 [19] compliant sequences of operation defining the mode of operation, state of operation, supply air temperature and airflow setpoint reset behaviour. The function was first used with a synthetic BAS dataset generated by using an EnergyPlus model of a 26-zone VAV AHU system in Ottawa, Canada. The accuracy was quantified by comparing inverse model-based virtual meter predictions with EnergyPlus meter outputs for the sensible heat transfer rate from AHU heating and cooling coils and perimeter heating devices. The results of this analysis indicate that the virtual meters can estimate the monthly energy use for these three end-uses at CV(RMSE) and NMBE values of less than 6 % and 3 %, respectively. Notably, these error values are significantly lower than those deemed acceptable in ASHRAE Guideline 14 [49]. Once the accuracy of the virtual meters was verified against simulation data, the fault impact analysis function was demonstrated with measured BAS data from a real 72-zone VAV AHU system. The analysis revealed an energy savings potential of 43 % for heating and 22 % for cooling through the implementation of fault-free sequences of operation. The reduction in heating energy use was largely attributed to maintaining a constant supply air temperature setpoint year-round. This issue caused excessive use of the economizer state, even at cold winter temperatures below −10 °C. The reduction in cooling energy use was explained by a mistake in the state of operation sequence and a fault in the mixing damper behaviour. For the studied system, the state of operation sequence limits the availability of free cooling to outdoor temperatures below the supply air temperature setpoint. As a result, the economizer with cooling state, one of the four states of operation defined in Guideline 36, was not available; thus, the system was not taking full advantage of the cool outdoor air to offset mechanical cooling needs. In addition, the studied system could not sustain high outdoor air fractions, even when the outdoor air damper is at a fully open position. This also limited the VAV AHU system\u2019s ability to exploit outdoor air for free cooling, and increased reliance on mechanical cooling. Future work will expand the capabilities of the fault impact analysis method for dual-duct VAV AHU systems as well as systems with heat recovery. Further, the fault impact analysis method will be used on a real VAV AHU system, and the energy savings achieved will be compared to those that are predicted by the fault impact analysis method through a longitudinal measurement and verification study.

        "dc:description": "Fault impact analysis is an important phase of fault detection and diagnosis (FDD), enabling prioritization of the faults detected and allocation of resources to procure services and materials. However, many existing fault impact analysis workflows rely on building performance simulation (BPS) models with high engineering cost, limiting their use in FDD software. To this end, this paper introduces an inverse greybox model-based fault impact analysis method using building automation system (BAS) trend data from variable air volume (VAV) air handling unit (AHU) systems to quantify the heating and cooling energy impact of control system faults. It trains inverse models of a VAV AHU system by employing a sequential parameter estimation algorithm, formulates virtual meters quantifying the sensible heat transfer rate from AHU heating and cooling coils and the perimeter heating devices, and employs the virtual meters to estimate heating and cooling energy use of an existing VAV AHU system and the same system after fault correction. The method was used with a synthetic BAS dataset generated by using an EnergyPlus model of a 26-zone VAV AHU system in Ottawa, Canada. The results indicate that the virtual meters could estimate the monthly energy use for heating and cooling at a coefficient of variation of the root mean squared error (CV(RMSE)) of 4\u20136%. The method was demonstrated with measured BAS data from a 72-zone VAV AHU system, revealing an energy savings potential of 43% for heating and 22% for cooling through fault correction.",
