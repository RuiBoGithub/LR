School of Information Science and Engineering Wuhan University of Science and Technology Wuhan 430081 China Smart residential communities tend to play an important role in demand response technologies due to their greater DR potential compared to single homes in smart grids. However, the heterogeneity in energy consumption between residents in a community leads to the low effectiveness of one-size-fits-all DR scheduling for a single home. To reflect the heterogeneity of energy consumption among residents and realize the demand response scheduling for a community, a centralized DR scheduling algorithm was presented. It introduces the willingness to pay to quantify the heterogeneity of residents' energy consumption by making full use of fuzzy clustering. Then, the quantized willingness to pay is applied to a Nash equilibrium game framework to maximize the individual surplus of residents, better adapting to all the demands of the residents in the community. Simulation results show that compared with the demand response scheduling algorithm without WTP, the presented demand response scheduling algorithm with WTP can reduce the amount of transferred data by about 30%. Compared with a demand response algorithm using game theory, the presented demand response scheduling algorithm can reduce the energy cost of the community by about 10% and satisfy the diversified demands of the residents while maintaining a small peaking-to-average ratio. © 2022 Elsevier Science.

It can improve the energy efficiency of generation facilities and reduce the energy consumption of power users by utilizing the information interaction between power grids and power users [1,2]. Among the power users, the smart residential community, a group of smart home users located in the same geographical area, tends to play an important role in DR programs [3,4]. It has greater DR potential compared to the traditional smart home because independently taking DR decisions by home energy management systems (HEMS) easily leads to rebound peaks of power grids [5]. Fig. 1 depicts a centralized DR architecture for a typical residential community. DR scheduling algorithms run on an aggregator, a core part of the DR architecture. Aggregators typically aggregate load reduction capacity from multiple residential users and sell it on markets, hence generating revenue for the participating residential users. Thus they are usually located between the utility operator from power grids and end users. The aggregator collects the residents\u2019 appliance information and user acceptable energy cost from all residents. According to the real-time price information achieved by the aggregator from smart grids, DR scheduling algorithm makes the decision on the energy distribution among the residential users in the same community to reduce the peak-to-average ratio and cut down the energy cost. Designing a centralized DR scheduling algorithm that fits all the demands of a community is a challenge due to the heterogeneity in energy consumption between residents in a community. The heterogeneity is embodied in two aspects. One is the diversity in appliance type and magnitude, and the other is the heterogeneous affordability of energy costs for residents with various demands for comfort. As for the diversity in appliance type and magnitude, the current centralized DR scheduling for a community requires all the residents' appliance information. If the size of a community is extended and the number of residents increases, DR communication also increases. In addition, privacy is another growing concern due to accessing a lot of information on residents and their load. As for the heterogeneous affordability of energy costs, numerous research has been done on modeling the heterogeneity by data-driven approaches, such as modeling for user preference [6], modeling for user comfort [7], modeling for user satisfaction [8], modeling for user behavior patterns [9], and so on. The more accurate the modeling, the better it can capture the heterogeneity. However, the subjective factors caused by residents are an inevitable problem, which dramatically affects the accuracy of the modeling in a practical scenario [10]. In the context of DR scheduling in a community, we expect to find a way to quantify the above heterogeneity, which can integrate the diversity of appliances with the heterogeneous affordability without accessing too much private information about residents. To let the centralized DR scheduling better fit all the demands in a community, abundant literature applies the Nash equilibrium game framework for multiple smart homes with one aggregator [11\u201313]. Nash equilibrium game framework is verified to be a good method to model the decision-making process of many players whose objectives are largely interdependent [14,15]. Accordingly, we expect to introduce the heterogeneity of energy consumption to Nash equilibrium game framework and realize DR scheduling for a community. To address this issue, a DR scheduling algorithm, named DR-WTP-EPS, is presented in this paper. The main contributions of the paper are stated as follows: 1. The willingness to pay (WTP) model is introduced to quantify the heterogeneity of energy consumption in the proposed DR scheduling algorithm. Firstly, it adopts fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering to divide appliances into three power levels depending on historical appliance power data. The residents only provide the number of appliances in different power levels instead of providing all their appliance information, which protects the residents\u2019 privacy to a certain extent and reduces the communication traffic between the aggregator and the residents\u2019 HEMSs. Secondly, WTP model maps the residents\u2019 affordability of energy costs to the user target price. The higher the user target price, the higher affordability of energy cost for the resident. Thirdly, a normalized WTP metric is defined to integrate appliance information and the resident\u2019 affordability of energy costs. It provides a quantized value to indicate the strength of a resident\u2019s willingness to pay in the context of a community. 2. The equilibrium price scheduling (EPS) model is used by DR scheduling for energy distribution among the residents of a community. EPS is based on a Nash equilibrium game framework. It introduces the results of WTP to the utility function to maximize the individual surplus of residents, then the equilibrium price is solved by the adaptive iteration. By comparing the equilibrium price to the real-time price, DR scheduling implements the energy distribution for each resident in a community. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews related work and motivates our research, and Section 3 introduces the DR-WTP-EPS scheduling. Section 4 introduces the proposed DR-WTP-EPS scheduling algorithm. This is followed by simulation studies in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper. 2 Related work and motivation This section reviews the DR in the smart grid from three aspects at first. Secondly, it summarizes the common coordinate methods of energy distribution among the residents for DR scheduling in the smart community. Then, it reviews the modeling of the diversity of demands in a community. Finally, the motivation for our research is summarized. 2.1 Review on DR in smart grid A wide range of DR in the smart grid has been investigated from different sides. On the power system side, a significant amount of theoretical research and simulations about DR have been conducted. These researches focus on DR for microgrids and large-scale distributed clean energy, intending to maintain stable grid operation [16,17]. The microgrid can operate in grid-connected mode and off-grid mode. By DR control, the operation mode of the microgrid can be switched for maintaining the reliability of the microgrid to the power grid. There are also great uncertainties in the process of distributed energy generation. These uncertainties are not conducive to the stability of the power grid and their influence on the power grid can be reduced by introducing DR [18]. Microgrids with DR maintain stable grid operation by analyzing operating costs, emissions, PAR metrics [19]. On the operator side, research on the DR has concentrated on pricing schemes. The operators guide the consumption of end users through appropriate pricing schemes to match supply and consumption [20]. A consumer aware pricing strategy is proposed, where each user receives a separate energy price signal to optimally manage flexible user\u2019s demand [21]. A dynamic pricing DR algorithm is proposed, which can balance the energy supply and demand in the electricity market and improve the reliability of the power system [22]. On the users side, a significant body of research has focused on the management of user energy consumption. Smart grid users can be classified into industrial users, commercial users and residential users [23]. The DR of residential users has been studied more widely in the context of buildings [7,24,25], homes [26] and communities [27] due to its great energy-saving potential [28]. In this paper, we focus on the DR of the residential community. 2.2 DR scheduling for a community There are many research developments on the coordination techniques for DR scheduling in smart residential communities, among which the main methods can be summarized into three categories (i) multi-agent system (MAS); (ii)optimization techniques; (iii) game theory (GT). MAS generally refers to a body of multiple autonomous agents that interact, cooperate, and negotiate with each other to satisfy their designed objectives [29]. A kind of MAS-based energy community is proposed, where many components are considered to maximize overall self-sufficiency [30]. In brief, MAS is particularly suitable for modeling multi entities involved in the DR for the smart grid [31]. Optimization techniques usually adopt heuristic or intelligent algorithms to optimize energy scheduling in a community. For example, a HEMS architecture that integrates RES and ESS to sell excess energy to the community is proposed, in which PSO and BPSO optimization is used to reduce energy costs and PAR [32]. Furtherly, a multi-objective optimization model based on MINLP on the proposed HEMS architecture is established to balance energy cost, user comfort, and PAR [33]. This technique is often adopted in the design of DR for a single user such as HEMS. Game theory appears as a promising mathematical framework when applied to energy management in the community. It can be divided into two main branches: non-cooperative game theory and cooperative game [34]. A non-cooperative game-theoretic energy consumption scheduling framework incorporating local energy resources is proposed to coordinatively manage the scheduling of appliances of residents. The scheduling optimization converges to an equilibrium where all consumers can benefit [35]. In a kind of non-cooperative game theory based scheduling algorithm [15], each user independently controls its energy consumption scheduling and storage configuration strategy to reduce the energy cost of each user. In a cooperative game model that is used to form a community among customers [34], customers within the community help each other to minimize the cost of their energy consumption. Game theory has been widely studied because it can reflect the differences among the residents in a community with good scalability. In this paper, we utilized game theory to coordinate energy distribution among the residents in a community. 2.3 Modeling the diversity of demand in a community Current community-based DR models depict the diversity of demand from different perspectives. The diversity of demand can be manifested by appliance information. The charging preference of electric vehicles and thermal comfort from thermostatically controlled appliances (such as air conditioners) are considered as the diversity of demand [4]. The multi-residential DR scheduling model provides three elements to manifest the diversity of demand, the schedulable intervals of the appliances, the weight factor reflecting user preferences, and the number of appliances [36]. The proportion of shiftable appliances that users are willing to be scheduled by the community server is considered as the diversity of demand [37]. Similarly, the frequency of the interaction between users and shiftable appliances is viewed as the diversity of demand [38]. The diversity of demand can also be manifested by heterogeneous affordability of energy costs. User preferences are expressed as weights in MILP to present the affordability of energy costs [6]. User comfort is defined to describe the affordability of energy cost based on user history energy consumption by logical regression [7]. User satisfaction is modeled from electricity payment satisfaction and electricity usage satisfaction, which indirectly indicates the affordability of energy costs for users [8]. The consumption behavior of residents will directly affect the cost of electricity, which is a real depiction of the affordability of energy costs [9]. The different affordable abilities of the users in a community for the same energy cost are considered as the diversity of demand [39]. 2.4 Motivation The first step of a centralized DR scheduling algorithm for a community is to clarify the energy demand of each resident. Although some research views this diversity of demand as the heterogeneity in energy consumption to some extent [40,41], they need frequent two-way communication to access private information about residents such as the schedulable intervals of the appliances, the proportion of shiftable appliances that users are willing to be scheduled, and so on. This motivates us to design a community DR scheduling using as little two-way communication as possible, which can quantify the heterogeneity in energy consumption by integrating the diversity of appliances with heterogeneous affordability. Furtherly, we are going to introduce the heterogeneity of energy consumption to the Nash equilibrium game framework and realize DR scheduling for a community. 3 DR-WTP-EPS scheduling The framework of DR-WTP-EPS scheduling is described in Fig. 2 . It includes two critical parts, WTP model and EPS model. WTP model is used to quantify the heterogeneity of energy consumption of the residents in the community. EPS model is used to allocate the optimal energy distribution in the community. The WTP model in the aggregator can calculate the corresponding WTP ( WT P 1 , W T P 2 , ⋯ , W T P I ) for each resident in a community according to the appliance information history data and the information of residents from each home. After receiving these WTPs from WTP model and the real-time price from smart grids, the EPS model calculates the optimal energy consumption ( x ∼ 1 , x ∼ 2 , ⋯ , x ∼ I ) for each resident in a community. The information of residents includes two parts, residents\u2019 target price and the appliance information. Residents\u2019 appliances are generally divided into three categories: Non-shiftable appliances (NSAs) need to be turned on 24\u202fh a day. They should be satisfied in any case during DR scheduling process. For example, refrigerators, alarms, video monitoring, and other appliances can be included in this category. Controllable appliances (CAs) operate within the range of minimum power and maximum power. Such appliances should be satisfied during their working hours. For example, dimming light bulbs and temperature-controlled HVAC are CAs. Shiftable appliances (SAs) usually refer to appliances that can be turned off during the high-price period. Those appliances are flexibly scheduled by DR scheduling algorithm according to the residents\u2019 willingness and dynamic variation of power price. Appliances such as fixed-rate battery chargers (EVs), dishwashers, and dryers fall into this category. 3.1 WTP model The heterogeneity of energy consumption between residents in the same community can be reflected by a reasonable definition of WTP model. Firstly, WTP model adopts fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering to divide the appliances into three power levels depending on the historical appliance power data. In FCM, each data object can belong to more than one group with different membership degree values [42]. Generally, a data object is partitioned into the group to which it has the maximum value of membership degree. The membership degree μ lj in fuzzy clustering satisfies Eq. (1). (1) μ lj ∈ [ 01 ] , ∀ l , ∀ j ∑ l μ lj = 1 , ∀ j 0 < ∑ j = 1 n μ lj < n , ∀ l where l indicates three different levels, j is the index for appliance, j ∈ [ 1 , n ] . The objective function of FCM is defined as the following Eq. (2). (2) J = ∑ l ∑ j = 1 n ( μ lj ) m P j - P ¯ l 2 where P j - P ¯ l represents the Euclidean distance of the data object P j to the cluster center P ¯ l , m is the fuzzifier parameter. The membership degree μ lj and the cluster centers P ¯ l are iteratively updated as Eqs. (3) and (4). (3) u lj = 1 / ∑ c = 1 3 P j - P ¯ l P j - P ¯ c 2 m - 1 (4) P ¯ l = ∑ j = 1 n u lj m P j / ∑ j = 1 n u lj m The cluster center denotes the average power of the appliances in each group. By FCM, the appliances for each resident can be grouped into three power levels. Secondly, residents with different comfort needs have heterogeneous bearing capacity for energy costs. Users who seek comfort rather than energy savings tend to be more affordable and willing to pay for more power. Accordingly, residents' affordability of energy costs is mapped onto user target prices p t i . The higher the target price set by users, the higher the affordability of energy costs for residents. Thirdly, a normalized WTP is defined as Eq. (5) which includes appliance information and residents\u2019 affordability of energy costs. (5) WT P t i = p t i λ 1 λ 2 N 1 , 1 i N 1 , 2 i N 1 , 3 i N 2 , 1 i N 2 , 2 i N 2 , 3 i P ¯ 1 P ¯ 2 P ¯ 3 + λ 3 P s = 3 i T E t i where λ 1 , λ 2 , λ 3 are the normalized parameters, λ 1 + λ 2 + λ 3 = 1 . According to the clustering results of FCM, appliances for each resident are clustered into three power levels. Then, each resident only provides the number of appliances at the corresponding power level ( N s , l i ), the average power of the appliances in each group ( P ¯ l ), and the operation period of shiftable appliances ( P s = 3 i T E t i ) instead of all the appliance information. It is noted that WTP has the following characteristics: (1) WTP is related to the target electricity price p t i . The heterogeneity of energy demand among the residents in a community is partly decided by the affordability of energy costs for residents. The higher p t i given by the resident, the more the resident is willing to pay for electricity to meet his power consumption. (2) WTP is related to the number of NSAs and CAs, N 1 , l i , N 2 , l i , and the average power, P. The heterogeneity of energy demand among the residents in a community is partly decided by the number of appliances and the power of the appliances owned by residents. For example, the WTP tends to be higher among users with high-power appliances. (3) WTP is related to the power P s = 3 i and state E t i of the SAs. Both NSAs and CAs work for 24\u202fh, while the state of SAs is defined by the residents in advance. WT P t i will increase when the working time slot for SAs arrives. (4) The parameters λ 1 , λ 2 , λ 3 are normalized for three categories of appliances. By adjusting these three parameters, the weight of three categories of appliances affecting WTP can be changed. 3.2 EPS model After receiving WTPs from WTP model, the EPS model calculates the optimal energy consumption ( x ∼ 1 , x ∼ 2 , ⋯ , x ∼ I ) for each resident in a community and the equilibrium price ( q t ) based on game theory. It is assumed that the energy price of a community pct adopts the congestion pricing principle [43]. We supposed in each time slot t, the energy consumption of user i is x t i . The price of energy within a time slot can be expressed as a function of the total energy consumption. As shown in Eq. (6): (6) p c t = a ( ∑ i = 1 I x t i / C ) k where a, k are constants, and C is the energy capacity of a community. Eq. (7) is used to represent the satisfaction level of the user's energy consumption [43]. It is a typical logarithmic utility function. (7) u i ( x ) = W T P i log x From the perspective of users, they expect to maximize individual surplus, and the objective function is shown in Eq. (8) [44]. (8) max ( u i ( x t i ) - x t i p c t ) User i maximizes individual surplus by selecting the appropriate x t i at time slot t. Each user i is associated with u i ( x t i ) at time slot t. User i adjusts energy consumption according to the following Eq. (9) (9) x t + 1 i = x t i + γ i ( W T P t i - x t i p c t ) where γ i controls the convergence rate of the algorithm. From the adaptive Eq. (9), the energy consumption of each user at time slot t will converge to the optimal according to their WTP, and the energy price of a community p c t will converge to the equilibrium price q t [43]. Thus, the optimal energy consumption x ∼ t i for each user in a community can be obtained by solving ( u i ( x t i ) ) \u2032 = q t . The result x ∼ t i is shown in Eq. (10). (10) x ∼ t i = WT P t i / q t The model reaches equilibrium when the energy consumption of users converges to the optimum. Eq. (11) can be derived from Eq. (6). (11) x ∼ t i = WT P t i C k / a ( ∑ i = 1 I x ∼ t i ) k Summing over i on both sides of Eq. (11), and Eq. (10) is substituted into the summing result to obtain the following Eq. (12) q t . (12) q t = a 1 k + 1 ( ∑ i = 1 I WT P t i / C ) k k + 1 Furthermore, Eq. (12) is substituted into Eq. (10), and the optimal energy consumption x ∼ t i can be expressed as Eq. (13). (13) x ∼ t i = ( WT P t i / ∑ i = 1 I WT P t i ) k / k + 1 ( WT P t i / a ) 1 / k + 1 C k / k + 1 As shown in Eq. (13), x ∼ t i is related to WT P t i . The higher WT P t i value is given by user i, the more optimal energy consumption for user i is allocated by the EPS model. 4 DR-WTP-EPS scheduling algorithm The flowchart of the DR-WTP-EPS scheduling algorithm is shown in Fig. 3 . It summarizes the main steps of the algorithm. Step 1: The aggregator obtains the power level of each group based on the history appliance information using FCM. Step 2: Users send the aggregator their target price, the number of all categories of appliances at each power level, and the operation period of SA. Then, the aggregator calculates the WTP of corresponding users at time slot t using Eq. (5). Step 3: The aggregator with the WTPs of all users in the community further calculates the equilibrium price q t of the community and the optimal energy consumption x ∼ t i of each user according to Eqs. (12) and (13). Step 4: The equilibrium price q t is the criterion used by HEMS for judging the real-time price from smart grid ( p g t ) is high or low. When p g t < q t , p g t is low. Otherwise, it is high. Finally, information about high/low price is sent to all HEMSs in the community. And then, they can make different decisions with the appliances in their homes. 5 Simulation In this section, we developed DR-WTP-EPS using MATLAB. Our goal in conducting this simulation was to determine the validity of WTP and the performance of the proposed DR scheduling by comparative analysis. The simulation is divided into three parts. (1) The validity of WTP model in describing the heterogeneity of energy consumption was testified by analyzing the quantification effect, time-varying characteristics, and the amount of transferred data. (2) The validity of DR-WTP-EPS scheduling is testified by analyzing the performance of Peak average ratio (PAR) and community energy cost. (3) The effect of the number of clusters on the proposed DR scheduling is analyzed. 5.1 Simulation scenarios According to the goals of the simulation, we design three simulation scenarios. Scenario 1. Verifying the validity of WTP Based on the history appliance information and the information of residents, the heterogeneity of residents in the community is quantified by WTP model through the proposed DR scheduling algorithm. To better comprehend and observe the WTP defined in this paper, 35 users and their appliance information were filtrated from the database published by Pecan Street [45]. Table 1 shows the number of each category of appliance for the 35 resident users. ID 1\u201335 respectively represent 1\u201335 resident users, and these resident users constitute a community in our simulation. As shown in the table, the number of appliances varies for each resident. For example, resident 1 has 9 NSAs, 1 CAs and 4 SAs. The community has a total of appliances 384. As mentioned above, the power of these 384 appliances is clustered into three groups with fuzzier m\u202f=\u202f2.5. In Eq. (5), λ 1 = λ 2 = 0.36 , λ 3 = 0 . 28 . In this scenario, three performance indicators about the validity of WTP are observed. (1) The quantification effect of the WTP. It refers to the fact that residents with low energy demand have correspondingly small WTP values. Similarly, residents with large energy demands have large WTP values. (2) The time-varying characteristic of WTP. It represents that the resident's WTP value varies with demand at each time slot of a day. (3) The amount of transferred data for DR communication with DR-WTP-EPS. It is used to count DR communication that frequently happens between the aggregator and HEMSs. To further illustrate that DR-WTP-EPS can reduce the communication traffic between the aggregator and the residents\u2019 HEMSs, DR with and without WTP are compared when the scale of community residents is increased from 35 to 105. Scenario 2. Verifying the validity of DR-WTP-EPS scheduling We compare DR-WTP-EPS with the DR algorithm proposed in [46] under different community resident scales. The WTP parameter in DR[46] is fixed and is proportional to the energy consumption demand of residents. The residents and appliance information of the simulation scenario still adopt the database published by Pecan Street [45]. The performance of DR-WTP-EPS and DR[46] is evaluated from four performance indicators: the number of SAs allowed to be turned on in the community ( S A on ), community energy cost, peak average ratio (PAR), and community energy consumption. (1) S A on . Turning on SAs will improve the comfort of residents and make them more satisfied. Therefore, S A on is one of the indicators to evaluate the performance of DR on the community resident side. (2) Community energy cost. The reason residents agree to shift some appliances to be turned on during low price time slots is the expectation of saving energy costs through DR. Reducing the energy cost is the purpose of the community residents. The community energy cost is calculated by Eq. (14). (14) Cost = ∑ t = 1 T ∑ i = 1 I x a t i q t (3) PAR. DR is to balance supply and demand, reduce the peak-valley difference, and reduce energy waste. The ratio of the peak time slot of energy consumption and the average energy consumption of the whole day is called PAR as shown in Eq. (15), which is used to measure the imbalance of energy consumption [46]. The more gradual the change in energy demand, the smaller the PAR, the better for the aggregator and grid side. (15) PAR = max ( ∑ i = 1 I x ∼ t i ) / 1 T ∑ t = 1 T ∑ i = 1 I x ∼ t i (4) Community energy consumption. The aggregator anticipates generating revenue by reducing the total energy consumption of a community. Whether the energy consumption is reduced is the most concerning issue for the aggregator. Scenario 3. Investigating the impact of the number of clusters on the DR-WTP-EPS performance Setting the different number of clusters will change the cluster center, and further affect the result of classification on the appliance power level. For DR-WTP-EPS, it will affect the optimal energy consumption ( x ∼ t i ) allocated by the aggregator to residents and the decision-making by HEMS for appliances. To investigate the impact of the number of clusters on the performance of DR-WTP-EPS, we define a performance measurement D t . (16) D t = ∑ i = 1 I x ∼ t i - x a t i It denotes the sum of differences between the optimal energy consumption ( x ∼ t i ) and the actual power consumption ( x a t i ) of residents. The unit of value is kW. D t is used to illustrate the efficiency of DR-WTP-EPS. Smaller value of D t indicates that the number of clusters set is appropriate for the community because the actual energy consumption of residents is closer to the optimal energy distribution in a community. 5.2 Simulation results Simulation results of scenario 1 Fig. 4 shows the WTP of residents 1 and 2 of 48 time slots in the community, and the WTP of residents changes over time. Fig. 5 displays that 35 residents have different WTP between 20:00 and 20:30. Accordingly, DR-WTP-EPS can quantify the heterogeneity of energy consumption of community users. Table 2 compares the amount of transferred data DR-WTP-EPS communication with and without WTP. Referring to Table 1, the number of appliance information to be transferred for DR communication without WTP is 253 NSAs, 80 CAs, and 91 SAs. The appliance information to be transferred in DR communication with WTP can be obtained by Eq. (5). Each resident only transfers 6 values about the total number of appliances in each power level of NSA and CA. There are 35 residents in the community, thus the total number of appliance information that needs to be transferred about NSA and CA in the community is 35×6\u202f=\u202f210. DR communication with WTP reduces the amount of appliance information that requires to be transferred by 29\u202f% compared to without WTP. Fig. 6 compares the changing trend of the amount of transferred data when the community scale expands with and without WTP. As the increase of the number of community residents, the amount of transferred data in DR communication without WTP will be much greater than that of DR with WTP. Compared with the case without WTP, DR communication with WTP reduces the number of appliance information to be transmitted by 32.5\u202f% and 33\u202f% when the number of community residents reaches 70 and 105. Accordingly, the larger the size of the community, the more obvious the advantage of DR with WTP in the amount of transferred data. Simulation results of scenario 2. Fig. 7 shows a comparison of DR[46] and DR-WTP-EPS from the residential side under different community scales. On the residential side, the residents care about the energy bill and their comfort level. Accordingly, the performance on energy cost and S A on are compared. And under any scale of the community, the total energy cost of the community residents in the DR-WTP-EPS is lower than that of the DR[46], while S A on is more than that of the DR[46] algorithm. It denotes that DR-WTP-EPS can enhance comfort while reducing the energy bill. Fig. 8 is the performance comparison between DR[46] and DR-WTP-EPS from the aggregator side under different community scales. On the aggregator side, the community cares about the total energy consumption and PAR, which contributes to the reliability of the smart grid. As shown in Fig. 8, the energy consumption of DR-WTP-EPS is almost the same as that of DR[46]. The PAR of DR-WTP-EPS is close to that of DR[46] algorithm. Fig. 9 shows the association between the energy bill and WTP of a resident in one day. It is easy to note that the trend of energy bills follows the trend of WTP. Accordingly, a resident with more appliances and high target prices will have a high WTP, resulting in a high energy bill. Simulation results of scenario 3 Fig. 10 compares the difference between the optimal energy consumption and the actual energy consumption under the different number of clusters (c\u202f=\u202f3,4,5). The comparison shows that D t of c\u202f=\u202f4 in the figure is the smallest in a day, which means that the actual energy consumption with c\u202f=\u202f4 is the closest to the optimal energy distribution in a community. 5.3 Summary of simulation analysis Table 3 summarizes the performance changes of DR-WTP-EPS in the simulation results. DR-WTP-EPS reduces the amount of DR communication by 30\u202f% compared with DR without WTP. Compared with DR[46], DR-WTP-EPS can save 10\u202f% on billing costs and improve 27.3\u202f% comfort for community residents. There is no obvious improvement in energy consumption and PAR. Thus, DR-WTP-EPS has the advantages of reducing DR communication traffic and energy bill as well as improving the comfort level of residents. Those performance improvements are achieved at the expense of slightly increasing energy consumption and PAR from the aggregator side. From the simulation results, the following conclusions are summed up: (1) DR-WTP-EPS can quantify the heterogeneous energy consumption of residents in a community, which lets the resident with high WTP has more energy distribution. It also has advantages in reducing DR communication traffic in large-scale communities, which benefits from adopting the fuzzy clustering algorithm in DR-WTP-EPS. (2) DR-WTP-EPS adopting a Nash equilibrium game framework has strong scalability. An increase in the number of residents in the community does not introduce a remarkable increase in total energy consumption and PAR. It means that the stability of the power grid is slightly affected by the community scale when using DR-WTP-EPS. Long-term use can save energy costs for a community. (3) The number of clusters in the DR-WTP-EPS will affect the performance of DR scheduling. 6 Conclusion and future work In this paper, we presented a DR scheduling algorithm for smart residential communities considering heterogeneous energy consumption. WTP model in the presented DR scheduling algorithm can quantify the heterogeneity of energy consumption among residents using a fuzzy clustering algorithm and a lower DR communication traffic while protecting the privacy of residents in a community to a certain extent. The EPS model in the presented DR scheduling algorithm applies the quantized WTP to the Nash equilibrium game framework to implement the optimal energy distribution among the residents in a community, satisfying the diversified demands of the residents. Compared with the DR algorithm proposed in [46], the presented DR scheduling algorithm can improve the comfort of residents, cut down the energy cost, and reduce the energy consumption of the community. Although current work found the clustering algorithm can be used to quantify the WTP and explored the impact of clustering on the performance of the presented DR scheduling algorithm, the clustering indicator for examining the performance of DR scheduling deserves further investigation. In addition, an extension of the presented DR scheduling algorithm for the communities with renewable energy sources will be studied furtherly.

        "dc:description": "Smart residential communities tend to play an important role in demand response technologies due to their greater DR potential compared to single homes in smart grids. However, the heterogeneity in energy consumption between residents in a community leads to the low effectiveness of one-size-fits-all DR scheduling for a single home. To reflect the heterogeneity of energy consumption among residents and realize the demand response scheduling for a community, a centralized DR scheduling algorithm was presented. It introduces the willingness to pay to quantify the heterogeneity of residents' energy consumption by making full use of fuzzy clustering. Then, the quantized willingness to pay is applied to a Nash equilibrium game framework to maximize the individual surplus of residents, better adapting to all the demands of the residents in the community. Simulation results show that compared with the demand response scheduling algorithm without WTP, the presented demand response scheduling algorithm with WTP can reduce the amount of transferred data by about 30%. Compared with a demand response algorithm using game theory, the presented demand response scheduling algorithm can reduce the energy cost of the community by about 10% and satisfy the diversified demands of the residents while maintaining a small peaking-to-average ratio. © 2022 Elsevier Science.
