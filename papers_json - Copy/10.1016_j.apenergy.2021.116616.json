Non-intrusive load monitoring is a promising technology in intelligent energy consumption management, which can provide insights for electricity use patterns and customer living habits, leading to the technical support of multiple smart energy use applications. As the most challenging problem in this specific field, the real time load disaggregation with simultaneous switching operations still remains unsolved due to its complexity and uncertainty. In this paper, a practical and feasible solution for the simultaneous action problems under real time non-intrusive load monitoring framework is proposed and investigated, which is capable of filling such research gap. At the first stage, to tackle the different kinds of overlapping combinations, an adaptive-window based detection approach is applied to capture the state changes. Secondly, a deep dictionary learning model is proposed in the real time load monitoring architecture, where the dictionary atom is generated in a semi-supervised modularization way and extended with high order dynamic features of appliances. Then, sparse coding formulized algorithm is presented to solve the problem, which is compatible of handling simultaneous occurrence of multiple switching events. The proposed model and algorithm are tested and verified in both simulation platform and field measurements. Results show that the operation-overlapping issue can be effectively addressed by the presented method, in addition to the high accuracy monitoring performance.

The worldwide energy demand and consumption have been dramatically increased along with the fast growth of global economy. Based on the policies of major governments and organizations, the International Energy Agency projected that the global energy demand in 2040 would increase by 25% compared with 2018, while the electricity demand would increase by 58% [1]. Since the electricity consumption accounts for an increasing proportion in total energy consumption, effective power usage management would contribute to the energy conservation and renewable energy utilization. Therefore, the related electric power management technologies have emerged as efficient energy-issue solutions and drawn wide attentions. Specifically, building load is the world\u2019s largest power consumption terminal, accounting for more than 40% electricity consumption on average in developed countries [2], even 76% in United States [3]. Therefore, the electricity managements focusing on the building power load have high academic value and industrial potentials, becoming the hot issues of the current international research forefront. One hotspot is the demand response (DR) technology, which utilizes the flexibility of specific loads to help with the distributed renewable energy utilization and provide ancillary services for distribution network. By realizing demand response, the energy users are moving closer to intelligence. Nevertheless, the flexible loads for DR are specific to certain electric appliances, so sensing the operation states of these appliance states is the prerequisite of demand response implementation. As an effective method to analyze the power load characteristics and evaluate the real time appliance states of buildings, non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) technology, originated from professor Hart in MIT [4], aims at monitoring the appliance states and power through the single electric meter installed at the customer entrance. NILM technology uses disaggregation algorithms instead of sensor networks in intrusive load monitoring, which is more simplified, economic, and reliable [5]. Besides, the appliance usage information could be provided without interfering the occupants\u2019 normal life, which is more acceptable by customers and highly desired from the demand response view. In addition to the distributed renewable energy utilization from demand response view, the energy conservation awareness of residents would also be enhanced by understanding their own power usage patterns, which is essential for energy sustainable development. In summary, NILM is a potential technical basis to support the implementation of energy user intelligence. Hence, various researches have been conducted in this field, especially for the disaggregation model and algorithm studies towards credible load detections and practical applications [6]. For credible load detections, two research directions have been investigated to achieve precise and accurate NILM performance, i.e., load signatures and disaggregation algorithms. Started from [4], the real power and reactive power are treated as the most typical steady state load signatures [7], and have been widely explored [8]. Furthermore, since different kinds of electric appliances have unique harmonics [9], the frequency domain features have been utilized with good performance [10]. The higher the sampling rate, the more information we can use to identify the appliance, where V-I trajectory [11], voltage/current/power transients based on Fryze\u2019s Time-Domain Power Theory [12] or S-transform [13], and phase noises [14] are representative signatures of such research. Basically, the use of high-resolution based load signatures can improve the overall NILM performance, at the expense of higher requirements of metering and processing devices. The investigation of disaggregation algorithms is the other field that researchers focus to enhancing NILM results, in which pattern recognition is considered as a more promising direction than traditional mathematic optimization. Based on whether the attributes of the learning appliances are known or not, the algorithms can be categorized into three classes, which are supervised learning [15], unsupervised learning [16], and semi-supervised learning [17], respectively. With the development of machine learning and deep learning, there emerges quantities of potential NILM algorithms from pattern recognition. Classification, the simplest machine learning algorithm, has been deeply researched in NILM, including K-means or C-means classification [18], multi-label classification [19], neuro-fuzzy classification [20], etc. Similarly, as a typical unsupervised learning approach, clustering is also widely used [21], even in the initial research [4]. Filtering algorithm is another promising approach dealing with NILM problem, while background filtering [22], particle filtering [23], and characteristic filtering [24] have been discussed. Considering the sequential features of appliance operation in NILM, the Markov model have been introduced at the early stage to extract the operation patterns from time series [25]. In particular, the Factorial Hidden Markov Model has been proven as a feasible approach for appliance operation forecasting and analysis [26]. Other data mining technologies, such as Convolutional Neural Networks [27], Wavelet Transform [28], Graph Signal Processing [29], and Spatiotemporal Pattern Network [30], have been studied in NILM problems. In general, the explorations of pattern recognition algorithms have achieved remarkable outcomes, leading to the satisfied accuracy over 90% under specific circumstances. However, the ultimate goal of NILM studies is to form a feasible alternative solution to take place of sensor network, and provide insights of specific loads states for intelligent energy use managements in real life. So the practicability of related research becomes an important concern from the engineering application perspective. Especially due to the perfect detection accuracy achieved in past studies, researchers started to transfer their focus to integrate NILM technologies into field applications. In Ref. [6], the idea of using real power only as the load signature has been surveyed, which is a potential way that highly simplifies measurement and storage requirements of field devices. Similarly, Ref. [31] have deeply investigated the practical NILM solutions for low-rate aggregation data, which are more compatible with existing metering systems, so as to [32]. Considering the fluctuant voltage supply at distribution network end-users, [33] proposed a robust solution based on Karhunen-Loève expansion and fast deconvolution, efficiently addressing the varying voltage issues. In order to tackle the identical or similar appliances belonging to the same kind of group, [34] initialized the NILM study for a group of appliances, effectively solving the problem of multi-similar appliance monitoring. In summary, some efforts have already been made to fill the gap between academic research and practical applications, but there still exist some barriers. Targeting at the real time NILM, which is appropriate for the demand response, the simultaneous switching operations in event-based monitoring is of great challenge. The simultaneous occurrence of multiple switching events is common in real life, but rarely investigated in research. In early studies, the detected operations are assumed to be non-overlapped with each other, i.e., one detected event only contains one switching operation. However, this assumption is not consistent with the real appliance operations, generating false detections when applying to field practice. Under the trend towards practical NILM applications, handling overlapped switching operations emerges as a valuable and urgent topic. Some studies did realize the importance of addressing overlapping operations in NILM problem, e.g. [3], [7], [12], [21], [25] and [29]. Nevertheless, the overlapping issue is only mentioned or briefly discussed in these studies, but not intensively investigated and tackled to our knowledge. In response to above observations, this paper initializes a thorough study on the real time NILM with overlapping issues. Firstly, the overlapping problem is explicitly discussed based on the real time event detection framework, and a dynamic event-window approach is presented to address the complexity and uncertainty of temporal combinations. On the basis of event window extractions, an enhanced dictionary learning based method is proposed to formulize the NILM model and solutions. Although dictionary learning methods have already been investigated in NILM problem [35], it is the first attempt to be coped with event-based real time monitoring problem to our knowledge. Such new utilization is challengeable, and realized by enhancing the dictionary learning from both model and solution views. In the model part, deep features of appliance, such as high order dynamics, are modularized in the dictionary atom in a semi-supervised way. In the solution part, the uncertain sequential shift of overlapped operations is handled by extending the dictionary atom with sparse coding principle. The use of high order dynamics and sequential shift of appliance patterns makes the dictionary more informative and essential, which is defined as Deep Dictionary Learning (DDL) in this paper. The proposed method is firstly verified on the Low Voltage Network Simulation (LVNS) platform [36], and then tested by NILM public datasets. In addition to solving the overlapping issue, the proposed approach also achieves credible detection results with flexible load signature utilization, proving to be a practical solution for various NILM based intelligent energy management applications. The major contribution of this study is the presence of a robust real time monitoring approach, which is able to address the simultaneous switching operations of diverse appliances. In other words, the assumption that one detected event contains only one switching operation is no longer required in NILM studies, making NILM research more consistent with the practical situations. Therefore, the proposed real time monitoring approach provides a practical basis for the implementation of demand response, and can enhance the intelligence of the energy users. Detailed technical contributions can be summarized as: \u2022 The operation overlapping issue in practical NILM applications is thoroughly discussed and addressed, while the gap between research and implementation is filled. \u2022 Dictionary learning approach is applied for the real time NILM problem for the first time, and enhanced by extending the atoms with high order dynamics and sequential shift design. \u2022 Sparse-coding based approach is proposed to solve the presented model, which is consistent with the principle dealing with overlapping issues in NILM. \u2022 The usage of load signatures is flexible in the proposed model, leading to the practicability for existing smart metering systems. \u2022 The proposed model and approach are verified by both simulation platform and field measurements, achieving outstanding load monitoring accuracy in addition to the capability of distinguishing simultaneous switching operations of electrical appliances. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the simultaneous occurrence problem of multiple switching events in real time NILM. The proposed dictionary learning based model and solution are formulized in Section 3. In Section 4, experiments based on simulation platform and filed measurements are analyzed. Conclusions are drawn in Section 5. 2 Problem statement Real time load disaggregation is an important branch of NILM research, which is the technical basis of power demand response and intelligent energy use managements. The event-based appliance monitoring is immensely popular, and only needs to do the analysis while detecting the changes of integrated readings, which is free of computational burden. Besides, the background noise can be naturally eliminated during the event extraction period, resulting in the robustness under noisy signals. In addition to above advantages, the intermediate state changes of both multi-state loads and continuous varying loads could also be modelled as common switching operation, indicating the compatibility of event-based methods. Dissimilarity of electrical features of appliance switching operations is the premise of such method. Technically speaking, event-based appliance monitoring belongs to the pattern recognition field, and the mathematic model can be described as (1) P ← find P i i ∈ [ 1 , N ] where P is the detected event signal, {\u2022} is the mathematic set symbol, Pi is the ith electrical feature of appliance switching operation, N is the total electrical feature number. For feasibility of practical implementation, the explicit form of (1) can be formulized as (2) P = P N · α α = α 1 , α 2 , ⋯ , α N \u2032 α i ∈ 0 , 1 and ∑ α i = 1 , i = 1 , 2 , ⋯ , N P N = P 1 , P 2 , ⋯ , P N where αi is the indicator whether the ith switch operation is detected, and 1 indicates positive result. Above formulation is based on the assumption that no overlapping issue happens, resulting from the consideration that switch operation of most appliances is an instantaneous behavior. Although rarely, the overlapping does happen when multiple occupants operate different appliances at the same time, e.g. the mother switches on the toaster when the child turns off the TV and goes to kitchen for breakfast, as shown in Fig. 1 (a). What is more common is that these two behaviors are slightly stagger, but the interval is too short to distinguish, leading to one detected event, seen in Fig. 1(b). Note that in Fig. 1(a) and (b), we consider a background appliance usage, i.e., a 100 W lighting, is always on. So the monitoring signal (integrated power readings) is higher than the summation of the decomposed appliance behaviors. Besides, in practical implementations, quantities of the appliance switch operation cannot be accomplished at one moment, e.g. the inductive motor driven appliances. The air conditioners are belonging to this type, and meanwhile an important source in demand response. So these appliances should be seriously considered in demand response oriented NILM. Such appliances need a so called \u201cevent window\u201d to capture all electrical features, which is proved to be an effective idea for event analysis [37]. However, due to the long switch duration, such operation is especially easy to be overlapped with other operations, as illustrated in Fig. 1(c) (overlapped at the switch instant) and 1(d) (overlapped during the start-up). Still, a background 100 W lighting usage is considered in both illustrations. Since existing event-based NILM approaches require two steady states, lasting at least 3\u20135 s for each, to identify the beginning and ending of the event, all illustrated scenarios in Fig. 1 are detected as one single event. Obviously, errors happen if we still consider the detected event as single behavior of unique appliance. As shown in Fig. 1, the overlapping problem is not only existing in event detection, but also complicated due to the time uncertainty of switching behavior. In order to formulize the particularity of such problem and maintain the original features, following model is presented based on (2) (3) P = P ~ N · α P ~ N = P 1 , P 2 , ⋯ , P N α = α 1 , α 2 , ⋯ , α N \u2032 α i ∈ 0 , 1 , i = 1 , 2 , ⋯ , N where P is the detected event series P = [P(1),P(2),\u2026,P(T)]', and T is the length of detected event. P ~ N is the feature matrix, and stores the T length electrical features of total N individual switching operations in each column. α is defined as occurrence matrix, while α = [α 1,α 2,\u2026,αN ]' and all components αi ∈ {0,1}, in which 1 indicates operation\u2019s happening. Compared with (2), the summation constraint is removed, leading to multiple operation detection at one time. The larger the sum of αi , the more the overlapping. Pi is the ith temporal electrical features of appliance switching operation, in the length of T. Notice that the length of original appliance temporal feature P ¯ i can be shorter than T, and the overlapping time is uncertain, so we need a time shift and extension calculation to cooperate the individual features in the presented model. (4) P i = β P ¯ i , t i , T where β( P ¯ i ,ti ,T) is defined as time shift and extension calculation, i.e., generate a T long sequential array with P ¯ i located at the ti position, and all the foregoing elements are assigned with the initial appliance state before the operation, while all the rear elements are assigned with the appliance steady state after the operation. Combining (3) and (4), a complete mathematic model for real time NILM with overlapping issues is established. The solutions of α and parameters of β are the key points, which are tackled in the following section. 3 Methodology Based on the presented model, the solution still follows the traditional NILM framework, i.e., event detection, feature extraction and appliance identification. Particularly for multi-state appliances, the transients among diverse operation states are also treated as common change behaviors, which are modelled together with other switching operations. However, in order to handle the problem features, each step is customized with specific approaches, forming an effective solution. 3.1 Event detection with adaptive dynamic window The window length T of detected event is an important parameter in (3). It directly determines the possibility of β calculation in (4). However, as illustrated in Fig. 1, the window length could be as short as several second (in Fig. 1(a)), or as long as one minute (in Fig. 1(d)). Though a large constant window could be applied to cover all situations, some disadvantages appear. For example, a long window could contain more independent switching operations, which is inconsistent with the overlapping definitions in Section 2, as well as the sparse coding principle in the following part. Therefore, an adaptive dynamic window idea is proposed and utilized in this study. Such implementation also provides additional benefits, e.g. if the detected window length is short, it indicates there is no long continuous operation in detected event. In detail, the event detection with adaptive dynamic window can be processed by the following procedures: \u2022 If change happens, use window of length Tste to identify the beginning steady state and ending steady state of the event, where Tste is the time index for steady state confirmation. \u2022 Denote the duration time between these two steady states as Tope , and calculate the total window length as T = 2Tste + Tope . \u2022 Extract the information located in the T time range, and form the detected event. Based on these, the detected event includes three parts: initial steady state, changes due to switching operations, and final steady state. The length is determined by the switching operation duration. 3.2 Feature extraction using deep dictionary learning The formulation (3) can be expressed as the total signal consisting of several individual compositions, which exactly matches the idea of dictionary learning. Therefore, this learning method is introduced, and modified to form a practical and applicable approach. 3.2.1 Dictionary learning approach Define D = [ d 1, d 2,\u2026, d N ] ∈ R T × N as the dictionary, and each column d k ∈ R T ×1 as an atom. Given a target signal x ∈ R T ×1, the problem is defined as dictionary learning if following linear combination establishes (5) x = D · α where α ∈ R N ×1 and should be as sparse as possible. A key criterion to evaluate the dictionary learning model is the sparsity of parameter α . Based on this consideration, the classical optimization model of dictionary learning can be described as (6) min D , α x - D · α F 2 + λ g α α where ||\u2022|| F is the F-norm calculation, λ is the regularization parameter, and g \u2022(\u2022) is the unified sparsity measurement function. Eq. (6) provides an alternating optimization problem, which is complicated but can be solved using K-SVD algorithm. However, in real time NILM problem presented in (3), the occurrence matrix is binary, resulting in a discrete calculation model. Compared with traditional dictionary learning solution model in (6), such formulation shows potential for simplification. Therefore, in order to take full advantage of this, a semi-supervised modularization approach with high order dynamic characteristics of monitored appliances is proposed. Though been simplified, the presented approach reveals more features and essence of switching operations of electrical appliances, which are more effective in real time load monitoring and comprehensively discussed in the following part. 3.2.2 Deep dictionary learning Different from the dictionary learning utilization in image recognition, the analysis object here is the sequential series of switching operation, with significant temporal patterns. From this view, the time series data contain mass information, while the deep features can be extracted through difference of first order, second order and so on. To our problem, the signal trends are desired to help us with the identification of switching operations. Therefore, the high order dynamics are expressed with normalization. (7) Δ f = 1 , f ( t + 1 ) - f ( t ) > F th 0 , f ( t + 1 ) - f ( t ) ⩽ F th - 1 , f ( t + 1 ) - f ( t ) < - F th where Δ f is the normalized difference of first order of f . f can be the time series of signal P , or the normalized first order difference of the signal, i.e., Δ P . If the length of f is T, then the length of Δ f is T-1. Fth is the change threshold of f , and for original signal P it is the same with the power fluctuation threshold, while for Δ P it is 0.5. Based on (7), the normalized high order dynamics of major switching operations can be illustrated in Fig. 2 , where four common power-on and one common power-off are exampled. As can be seen, by implementation of normalization, the differences of first order and second order can reveal more features of signal temporal patterns. For the first order difference, there are two patterns: 1) The positive 1 indicates the sequence increase and the negative 1 indicates the sequence decrease. 2) The spike indicates the instantaneous change and the flat 1 (or −1) indicates the continuous change, while the length of the flat is the continuous change duration. For the second order difference, spikes dominate. The deep features can be extracted by pairing spikes: 1) If a positive spike is followed by a negative one, there is an increase event. If a negative spike is followed by a positive one, there is a decrease event. If two positive spikes appear consecutively (including the 2 samples flat), there is a decrease first, then followed by a steady state, and lastly an increase. So as to the two consecutive negative spikes. 2) The time interval between two spikes indicates the lasting time of the change. By combining the normalized first order difference and second order difference, it is easy to analyze the main characteristics of monitored signals while minimizing the disturbances of noise. In other word, the principal patterns of switching events can be extracted through the above modelling of normalized high order dynamics. However, in the framework of dictionary learning, the form of only spikes in second order difference easily generates errors if there is a time mismatch. Considering that some features in first order difference and second order difference are repetitive, only the spike sequences of second order difference, revealing the increase or decrease trends of signals, are used in our dictionary learning. Define the spike sequence function as π(\u2022), and what we do by π(Δ(Δ P )) is to remove all the zero elements in Δ(Δ P ) and retain the non-zero elements as the new series. Take the illustrations in Fig. 2 as examples, the π(Δ(Δ P )) values for (a) to (e) are [1,-1], [1,-1,1], [1,-1,1], [1,-1,1,-1] and [-1,1], respectively. As can be seen, the spike sequence of second order difference reveals the change trend or pattern of signals. Since both Fig. 2(b) and 2(c) are following the pattern that first increase and then decrease, the spike sequences are the same. In essence, the use of spike sequence indicates the concerns on the change pattern. As to the time duration feature, it is handled by the first order difference. In order to be consistent with the original model shown in (3), the utilization of high order dynamics in deep dictionary learning can be formulized as (8) Δ P = κ Δ P ~ N · α \u2032 π Δ ( Δ P ) = π κ Δ ( Δ P ~ N ) · α \u2033 where for the matrix P ~ N , the normalized difference operation Δ is implemented for each column, so as to the matrix Δ P ~ N . α' is the occurrence matrix of first order dynamics and α\u201c is the occurrence matrix of second order dynamics. The element values of both occurrence matrices are binary. κ(\u2022) is denoted as the normalization function, where all calculation elements are all 1, −1 or 0. If we have 1 + 1 calculation, then the result is 1. If we have (-1)+(-1) calculation, then the result is −1. If we have 1+(-1) calculation, then we compare the original change value of corresponding Pi , and set the result as the 1 if increase change dominates, −1 if decrease change dominates, and 0 otherwise. Since the occurrence matrix is pivotal in presented problem, the relationships of three occurrence matrices are further discussed. Obviously, if the detected event is a single switching operation, then we have α == α' == α\u201c . However, in overlapping issues, some high order dynamics may be submerged due to the use of normalization, as shown in Fig. 3 , where Fig. 2(a) is overlapped with Fig. 2(d). Therefore, the matrix α mismatches α\u201d , while the non-zero elements in α\u201c should all exist in α and the non-zeros elements number of α could be more than α\u201d . Meanwhile, due to the normalization function used for first order difference, the first calculation in (8) should be correct no matter we use α' = α or α' = α\u201c . Hence, the determination of occurrence matrix should follow an alternating way from a mathematic point of view, which is of high computational burden. However, in the physical sense, the occurrence matrix can be handled in a simplified way based on following analysis. Based on the characteristics of the high order dynamics, the submersion only happens when the change trends of overlapped individual switching operations are the same. But the first order calculation is not impacted due to the normalization, i.e., α' = α is established, seen in Fig. 3(b) and (d). Nevertheless, the second order calculation is influenced, indicating the difference between α and α\u201c . Since the deep features of second order difference are extracted through spike pairing and the consecutive positive (or negative) spikes rarely appear, we directly remove such continuously repeated spikes during spike sequence operation, and this calculation is denoted as π ~ · . By doing so, the spike sequence for Fig. 3(e) is [1,-1,1,-1], which is exactly the same with that of Fig. 3(c). Hence, if the π ~ · operation is used instead of π(\u2022) in (8), then α\u201d == α is established. Based on such analysis, the deep dictionary learning is modelled as (9a) P = P ~ N · α (9b) Δ P = κ Δ P ~ N · α (9c) π ~ Δ ( Δ P ) = π ~ κ Δ ( Δ P ~ N ) · α where all the occurrence matrices are unified to be α . Thus, no additional calculations are required for α' and α\u201c , which highly simplifies the solution. By introducing high order dynamics as deep dictionary basis, the complete learning model (9) contains more operation features compared with (3). The original temporal features lie in (9a), which follows the stated problem model. The change trend and duration are reflected in 9(b) in a normalized way, and the change pattern is concentrated in 9(c). Obviously, in the framework of dictionary learning, the dynamic change features of integrated signals are easier to be captured with high order difference modelling. 3.3 Appliance identification based on sparse coding Based on the modelling stated above, we have a new dictionary learning formulation. Compared with conventional dictionary learning, the presented model is special on three aspects: 1) There are three dictionaries and three atom models, i.e., time series, normalized first order difference, and spike sequence of second order difference. 2) The atom is initialized based on the physical features of individual switching operation, which is referred as featured operation in this work. 3) Since the occurrence matrix α should be as sparse as possible and the sparsest form is α\u201c , the high order occurrence matrices α' and α\u201d can help with the initialization of α . The sparsity of α exactly matches the overlapping problem properties, i.e., least operations are preferred in the detected event. Therefore, the sparse coding principle is followed to solve the problem, i.e., (10) min t , α P - P ~ N · α F 2 + λ 1 Δ P - κ Δ P ~ N · α F 2 + λ 2 π ~ Δ ( Δ P ) - π ~ κ Δ ( Δ P ~ N ) · α F 2 + λ α g α α where λ 1, λ 2, and λα are the regularization parameters for first order model, second order model and sparsity model. t is the time shift matrix, i.e., t = [t 1,t 2,\u2026,tN ] and ti is the time shift parameter in (4). By adjusting the value of t , the three dictionaries are modified correspondingly due to the change of P ~ N . Once the sparse matrix is determined, we only need to optimize the ti corresponding to the non-zero positions in α . In (10), the dimensions of each dictionary layer are determined by how many electrical features are utilized, and the number of atoms is closely related to the number of featured operations for all appliances, as well as their characteristics. The (10) follows the idea of dictionary learning solution, and uses t to implicitly update the atoms in an unsupervised way. Therefore, combining the initialization and update process of dictionary atoms, the presented approach belongs to the semi-supervised learning method. Such data-driven framework shows advantages for the scalability problems. Considering that L2 regularization is used in (10), the overfitting problem could also be prevented in consideration of the problem attribute and adequate learning samples. 3.4 Method flow and procedures Based on the ideas discussed above, following procedures are established to implement the proposed method: \u2022 Step 1. Extract the featured operations from training dataset via data cleaning and clustering. The database for individual operations is formed. \u2022 Step 2. Use adaptive dynamic window-based approach to extract the real time monitoring event. The event length is determined. \u2022 Step 3. Initialize the dictionary atoms via Eq. (4), (6), (7) and (9), while the temporal features and high order dynamic features are considered. \u2022 Step 4. Implement (10) to iteratively optimize the dictionary and occurrence matrix, until the best fitting is achieved. \u2022 Step 5. Analyze the calculated occurrence matrix and find the switching appliances. Based on these procedures, the implementation flow of proposed real time NILM approach is illustrated in Fig. 4 . There are two main blocks in the proposed method, i.e., supervised data and dictionary initialization and unsupervised dictionary update and sparse coding. There are several points need to be clarified. First of all, in the proposed model (9) and solution (10), multiple electrical features, such as real power (P), reactive power (Q) and harmonics (H) can be utilized. And of course, the more features are used, the better the detection performance. However, to cope with the field measurement constraints, the proposed approach achieves satisfactory accuracy even with only real power analysis, indicating the good scalability of the proposed approach. Secondly, the initial feature library P ¯ i , i.e., the original switching operation database, is generated following the electrical characteristics during the training phase. Although sub-meters can be used to obtain the dataset of switching operation signals, in this work the quantities of dataset are extracted by applying the adaptive window approach on the integrated training signals. And the corresponding tags indicating the correlation between event and appliance are also labelled. By applying clustering to the dataset for each appliance, the featured operations are extracted. Once the monitoring object is determined, the featured operations for individual appliances are also fixed. For newly added appliance, the training procedure is necessary before implementing real time monitoring. The appliance feature uncertainty, caused by the appliance noise or background noise as well as the measurement error, is diminished by the use of high order patterns. Last but not least, the unsupervised update of dictionary atoms focuses on the uncertainty of overlapping time, leading to a feasible solution for the overlapping issue. However, if there is no overlapping issue in detected event, then the number of non-zero element in α is one, and t is no longer to be optimized. Such calculation is quite computationally friendly, which also achieves satisfactory accuracy for traditional monitoring problem. 4 Case studies The evaluation metrics are provided first in this section, where common metrics are introduced and adjusted to tackle overlapping problems. Then, the test results are illustrated and discussed based on simulation environment and field measurement. 4.1 Evaluation metrics For overlapping issues, what we concern the most is that whether all overlapped operations are detected correctly. Therefore, event accuracy is defined first to evaluate the event-based monitoring performance. (11) A e = C O e C O e + W O e × 100 % where e ∈ Ωe, Ωe is the set of all extracted events. COe is the correct operation detections, denoting the number of operations that are correctly recognized in event e. WOe is the wrong operation detections, denoting the number of operations that are incorrectly recognized or missed in event e. Traditional precision, sensitivity, and F-measure are the most commonly used accuracy metrics for event-based NILM evaluation [38]. However, in order to cope with the overlapping issues, the event-based statistics in traditional metrics calculation are replaced by operation-based statistics, resulting in the compatibility of handling events with overlapped operations. In detail, following definitions and adjustments are used. Precision is defined as the proportion of operations recognized as appliance c that are correct, which is denoted as Pc and follows (12) P c = T P c T P c + F P c × 100 % where c ∈ Ωc, Ωc is the set of all electrical appliances. TPc is the true positive detections, denoting the number of operations that are correctly recognized as appliance c. And FPc is the false positive detections, denoting the number of operations that are incorrectly recognized as appliance c. Sensitivity is the proportion of operations belonging to appliance c that are also recognized correctly, which is denoted as Sc and follows (13) S c = T P c T P c + F N c × 100 % where FNc is the false negative detections, denoting the number of operations belonging to appliance c that are incorrectly recognized as other appliances. By combining precision and sensitivity, we have a composite index F-measure, which is denoted as Fc and follows (14) F c = 2 × P c × S c P c + S c × 100 % 4.2 Low voltage network simulation analysis The Low Voltage Network Simulation (LVNS) platform detailly models the electrical behaviors of around thirty home appliances based on the multiphase LV network of North America [36]. The platform covers an extended simulation period of 24 h and has an output resolution of one snapshot per second. Beside the real power, the reactive power and harmonics can also be extracted through the outputs. The verification for the numerous NILM algorithms is also one of the original motivations for the platform development. 4.2.1 Discussion on overlapping detections Based on the NILM applications of LVNS, 18 diverse electrical appliances with more than 60 featured operations are utilized for overlapping issue study. In addition to normal ON or OFF operations, there are more featured operations for multi-state appliances due to the state transitions. The detailed information of the appliances is listed in Appendix Table A1. Due to the large quantities of overlapping combinations, for each appliance, we typically generate numbers of operations overlapped with other appliance for analysis. The average accuracy results are illustrated in Table 1 . As can be seen, the proposed approach performs much better than traditional approaches dealing with overlapping issues. The average accuracy of CA is around 20% and 30% for WA in the presented study, while this value is improved to be more than 60% by the proposed approach even with only real power as electrical feature. The accuracy is further enhanced to be more than 80% if real power, reactive power and harmonic features are all utilized. Such remarkable improvements demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach dealing with overlapping problems. Besides, the utilization of high order dynamics is also proven to be useful in Table 1. In all studied appliances, furnace, a typical multi-state appliance, is the most featured appliance with complicated sequential dynamics, and achieves the highest accuracy with the proposed approach. There are three operating power states for furnace, and correspondingly six intermediate switching operations clustered. By detecting the featured intermediate operations, the state transitions of furnace can be comprehensively analyzed. Considering the real power, reactive power and harmonics, the accuracy of furnace related overlapping events detection is more than 88%, which is highly qualified for almost all NILM applications. In order to provide deep insights of the dynamics utilization, the detailed detection results of furnace operation related events are illustrated in Table 2 , where all eight featured operations of furnace are separately presented in Fig. 5 . As can be seen, the sequential dynamics is of great challenge for traditional CA method, while the detection accuracy is lower than 20%. As for the WA method, since the temporal dynamics are captured and considered in event windows, the precision is two-times improved comparing with CA. Lastly, the proposed approach adequately utilizes the characteristics of first order and second order of appliance temporal operations, and furtherly achieves remarkable improvement in the detection accuracy. Since the second order dynamic is utilized to identify the operation pattern, the operations with specific patterns are precisely detected in the presented case, e.g. the accuracy of OP1 and OP2 (with spike pulse up pattern) are both over 92%, so as to the fluctuation transient up based operations. For operations with similar patterns, e.g. OP4 and OP6, the first order dynamic is utilized to identify the differences in time intervals or durations. According to the presented furnace case, the utilization of high order dynamics is proven to be effective in load disaggregation, especially for these complicated operations. Particularly, with the proposed approach, we find the more complicated the featured dynamics, the more precise the detection results. With satisfied accuracy, the efficiency of different approaches is also investigated in Table 3 . The statistic time consumptions are calculated based on 10,000 times tests, and each test event is randomly generated with overlapping issues. As can be seen, the more electrical features utilized, the higher time consumption. Generally, due to the simplified consideration, the consuming time of traditional approaches is at millisecond level. Because the sparse coding based solution presented is in essence a greedy algorithm, the time consumption is significantly increased. Though the time consumed by the proposed approach is longer, it still meets the real time monitoring requirement. The average time consumed by the proposed approach with all electrical features utilization is around 0.56 s, which is sufficient to implement the real time monitoring. While dealing with complicated operation patterns, the detection time may increase to be approximate 4 s, which is still available for real time disaggregation. Furthermore, take the accuracy into consideration, the proposed approach is a desired method dealing with overlapping issues under the real time monitoring framework. 4.2.2 Overall real time NILM performance Previous discussions have demonstrated that the proposed approach is effective in real time NILM with overlapping issues. In this subsection, the presented study is implemented on common simulations of LVNS, where the appliance connections are initialized as Table 4 . Discussions are followed to reveal the impact of overlapping issues on NILM problem. Because the outputs of LVNS are one-day power usages and profiles, simulations are conducted for quantities of days. The load disaggregation results are shown in Table 5 , where the average metrics are listed. As can be seen, the more electrical features applied, the more accuracy results generated. No matter which electrical features are selected, the proposed approach achieves the best performance in accuracy. Such results demonstrate that the introduction of sparse coding based solution can not only solve the overlapping problems, but also be compatible with the common real time load disaggregation. Hence, the effectiveness of applying sparse coding solution in presented study is proved. Besides, the overall F-measure of the proposed approach is over 90%, even with only real power as the feature. Such results lead to the potential of simplified feature utilization. The enhancement between WA and PA can be observed in Table 5. Due to the simulations are randomly generated based on LVNS platform, the observation indicates that the overlapping problems do really exist in common life. Such findings also demonstrate the practical contributions of the proposed study. In order to provide some insights of LVNS based case, one day simulation is selected for deep investigations. The real power, of both phase A and B, are illustrated in Fig. 6 . The selected day is a typical weekend, and the occupants are busy with cooking at noon and laundry in the evening. Since the occupants stay at home all day, all appliances are activated in the 24 h run. Therefore, we can clearly analyze the results through the one day simulation. The detailed evaluation metrics for each appliance are illustrated in Table 6 , where different electrical features are tested by the proposed approach. The F-measure lower than 85% are all from the simple ON-OFF appliances, of which operation occurrences are relatively rare in one day simulations, e.g. CFL, MW, PC and so on. The low metrics are generated due to the infrequent operations, while a false detection may lead to large error. Though there exist some deficient metrics for some appliances, the proposed approach performs well in real time NILM on the whole. Most precision, sensitivity, and F-measure of appliances are over 90%, even with only real power as feature. While just considering real power, the average F-measure is still higher than 90% and only PC and INC are lower than 80%. These results further demonstrate the flexibility of load signature usage for practical applications by the proposed approach. 4.2.3 NILM performance under noisy signals For practical applications, the noise cannot be ignored. Although the proposed approach is event-based, which is robust while considering background noise, the appliance noise should be thoroughly investigated. Hence, in this subsection, the impact of noise on the NILM performances is discussed. The case illustrated in last subsection is initialized as the basic case, and comparisons are done based on different additional Gaussian distributed noise. Table 7 shows the real time detection results under different noise levels. From the results in Table 7, it is demonstrated that the proposed approach performs robustly under noisy signals. Note that the basic case in LVNS does have taken noise into consideration. The case with additional 20% noise is severe, indicating the appliance power consumption varies between [0.8,1.2] of rated power following Gaussian distribution, which is unlikely to happen in reality. Even so, the average precision, sensitivity and F-measure by proposed approach are all higher than 80%. Considering the real situations of NILM applied, the proposed approach can effectively deal with noisy signals in real time monitoring. 4.3 Field measurement verification In order to verify the proposed studies on practical applications, the typical NILM public dataset, i.e., REDD [39], is introduced to test the feasibility and performance of the proposed approaches. Specifically, the low-frequency data of House 1 from REDD are comprehensively investigated. Only real power or apparent power is provided in low-frequency data. According to the presented studies, the dynamic features of each appliances in resolution of per-second are required for both training and testing. Since the resolutions of separated appliance operation data in REDD are 3\u20135 s, we use the adaptive dynamic window approach to extract the event from main data based on the separated time stamp first. Then we classify the patterns and features by data cleaning and clustering. Considering the data preprocessing is not the main contribution of this paper, the details are not illustrated here. The basic information of appliances in this house are shown in Table A2. 4.3.1 Dealing with overlapping problems Following the previous outlines, the effectiveness of the proposed approach dealing with overlapping operations are discussed first. Though the appliance number is less than that in LVNS, the featured operation number is similar due to the complicated operation patterns in real field measurements. Therefore, the scale of overlapping issues is similar to the LVNS case. Under such circumstances, the average accuracy results of overlapping events detection are presented in Table 8 . Note that only real power is utilized as electric feature due to the limitations of low-frequency field measurements. Based on Table 8, we find that the proposed approach collaborates well with the field measurement data. Even with only real power as the electrical feature, the average accuracy is 72%, achieving a remarkable improvement compared with the traditional CA (with average accuracy of 13%) and WA (with average accuracy of 20%) methods. Because only real power is utilized, the operation patterns of appliances become more important in load detection, especially for those appliances with similar rated power. For example, there are four appliances, i.e., GFI, KO2, MW, and OV1, of which rated power are around 1600 W. It is quite difficult for traditional CA to distinguish them precisely, leading to the detection accuracy all below 10%. And even with time window technique in WA, the average accuracy for these appliances is no more than 20%. By implementing the proposed approach, the featured dynamic patterns and combinations are extensively considered, resulting in the accuracy higher than 70%. Therefore, the proposed approach is demonstrated to be flexible in load signature utilization for practical applications. 4.3.2 Common on-line monitoring In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach under real NILM applications, the first three weeks data of House 1 from REDD are used for demonstration. After data cleaning and correction, the appliances listed in Table A2 are considered as the monitoring target. The average performance metrics by different approaches are shown in Table 9 , where only real power is set as electrical feature. Because we have several appliances with similar rated power, the traditional CA is not appropriate for such monitoring, and only half events are correctly recognized. With window technique, the WA performs much better, resulting in an accuracy of around 80%. However, since overlapping issues do exist in real applications, the PA improves the performances by 5% further on, leading to around 85% for all metrics. The detailed evaluation metrics for all appliances by PA are illustrated in Table 10 . Because the monitoring period contains more than 20 days, the metrics are more discrete than one-day evaluation. However, the appliance of DRY maintains an outstanding result due to the two phase connections and giant rated power. OV2 also keeps a good detection performance, due to the unusual power and dynamic features. DW is the most complicated appliance in this case, and LIG3 is the smallest appliance. The monitoring performance of both appliances are not good, which is consistent with the real background. Even so, the general performance of the proposed approach on real field measurements is good, and the proposed study is demonstrated to be effective in field NILM applications. 4.3.3 Comparisons with newly raised methods Based on the tests on REDD dataset, the comparisons with the newly raised approaches are conducted in this subsection. Since the approach presented in [35], which is short for MLCDDL, applies the similar basic technology, it is discussed at the first stage. Note that the NILM object and architectures of MLCDDL and our approach are diverse with each other, so it is not possible to compare all the detailed metrics. However, the overall performance evaluation can be investigated by comparison of F-measure, which are illustrated in Table 11 . As can be seen, the proposed approach outperforms the MLCDDL. Besides, the MLCDDL only detects the appliances states, while the proposed approach could distinguish the diverse operation stages of multi-state appliances, leading to more refined results. Since the approach presented in [40], named ML-KNN, is considered as an outstanding representative of multi-label classification based methods, it is compared with our approach. The F-measures for both overall performance and individual appliance are shown in Table 12 . Generally speaking, the proposed approach outperforms the ML-KNN in terms of Fc . Although the proposed approach shows a little bit deficiency for small power appliances monitoring, e.g. lighting, it outperforms the ML-KNN for all large power appliances. Such results indicate that the proposed approach is robust for demand response utilizations, where large power appliances are more concerned. 5 Conclusion In this paper, a comprehensive study dealing with simultaneous actions under real time non-intrusive load monitoring framework is investigated. At the first stage, the problem formulation is established based on the consideration of overlapping characteristics. Secondly, deep dictionary learning approach is proposed to utilize the dynamic features in real time monitoring. Lastly, a systematic solution following sparse coding principle is proposed. The whole study is verified on both simulation platform and field measurements. Results show that events with overlapped switching operations do exist in real life. The proposed study not only handles the overlapping issue well, but also achieves satisfied performance in common load monitoring. With the robust real time monitoring approach proposed in this work, the event based non-intrusive load monitoring studies are no longer constrained by the assumption that one change event only contains a single switching operation. Therefore, an important gap between theoretical study and practical applications is filled, leading to the practical implementations of advanced load managements. In conclusion, the proposed study provides an effective technical route to support the implementation of energy user intelligence. In particular, the potential smart energy use applications based on this study are diverse, including but not limited to the following fields: \u2022 Real time demand response. By monitoring the specific switching behaviors of flexible resource appliances, the real time response capability can be analyzed timely and response instructions can be issued precisely. \u2022 Abnormal energy consumption alarm. The continuous monitoring for a certain user can distinguish the abnormal energy consumption and sound the alarm in time, such as finding an appliance that is turned on for too long time. \u2022 Energy habit improvement. Once an improper energy behavior is detected, timely feedbacks to the occupants can help them to improve their energy habits.

As the most challenging problem in this specific field, the real time load disaggregation with simultaneous switching operations still remains unsolved due to its complexity and uncertainty. In this paper, a practical and feasible solution for the simultaneous action problems under real time non-intrusive load monitoring framework is proposed and investigated, which is capable of filling such research gap. At the first stage, to tackle the different kinds of overlapping combinations, an adaptive-window based detection approach is applied to capture the state changes. Secondly, a deep dictionary learning model is proposed in the real time load monitoring architecture, where the dictionary atom is generated in a semi-supervised modularization way and extended with high order dynamic features of appliances. Then, sparse coding formulized algorithm is presented to solve the problem, which is compatible of handling simultaneous occurrence of multiple switching events. The proposed model and algorithm are tested and verified in both simulation platform and field measurements. Results show that the operation-overlapping issue can be effectively addressed by the presented method, in addition to the high accuracy monitoring performance.",
