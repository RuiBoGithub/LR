Fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) can reduce a large amount of energy wasted by faults in variable air volume (VAV) systems. This paper presents a FDD method for detecting and diagnosing multiple faults of VAV terminals using a hybrid method. A self-adaptive zone air-temperature model is presented and used to detect faults of the VAV terminals by comparing the residuals between predicted and measured values with corresponding fault detection thresholds. The model parameters, which are normally constant and determined according to experience from short-period data, are periodically adjusted to improve the model prediction accuracy on the basis of operating data by using a chaos particle swarm optimization algorithm. Moreover, a two-layered random forest-based fault diagnosis method is presented to isolate multiple faults of VAV terminals according to the complexity of the fault symptoms. An expert rule-based fault diagnosis layer is used to isolate VAV terminal faults with simple fault symptoms. A random forest-based fault diagnosis layer is utilized to diagnose VAV terminal faults with complex fault symptoms by adopting a binary decision tree-based multi-label technique. The proposed FDD method is validated using operating data from real VAV systems involving 13 single-fault cases and 6 simultaneous-fault cases. The validation results indicate that the proposed FDD method can accurately detect and diagnose simultaneous multiple faults with only a few independent fault samples and a minimal number of simultaneous-fault samples.

VAV terminals play a significant role in reducing energy consumption, and in maintaining acceptable indoor environments in buildings. However, buildings tend to have a large number of VAV terminal faults, owing to the large number of VAV terminals, distributed dispersion, and dependence on the performance of their control systems [1]. Fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) is a useful tool for saving energy and enhancing indoor thermal comfort in heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems [2]. FDD is an automatic process for detecting and analyzing faulty operations, performance degradations, and broken components. Therefore, it is important to develop FDD methods for VAV systems in real buildings. Many FDD methods have been successfully applied to VAV systems. These FDD methods can be divided into three types: model-based methods [3\u20137], knowledge-based methods [8\u201313], and data-driven methods [14\u201322]. However, relatively few studies have been performed on FDD for VAV terminals, owing to a lack of information and methods [23]. Jeffrey et al. [24] used a control chart method to detect faults of VAV terminals. VAV terminal performance assessment control charts (VPACC) were used to analyze the operating data of the VAV terminals and to monitor their control processes. VPACC have been tested using emulation, laboratory, and field data sets. Qin and Wang [25] used principal component analysis (PCA) to detect and diagnose sensor faults of VAV terminals. A square prediction error statistic was used to detect sensor faults of VAV terminals. A sensor validity index was employed to identify faulty sensors. Du and Jin [16] used multi-level PCA models to detect multiple faults simultaneously occurring in VAV systems. A system-level PCA model was used to detect faults in view of the entire system. Two local-level PCA models were used to further confirm the occurrences of faults. A joint angle analysis was used to diagnose the multiple faults, based on separating the multiple faults into different locations. Seem et al. [26] proposed two performance indexes for monitoring the online control processes of VAV terminals. These two indexes were used to analyze the operating data of VAV terminals, and to detect faults of VAV terminals. Xiao et al. [1] used a diagnostic Bayesian network (DBN) method to detect and diagnose faults of VAV terminals. The structure and parameters of the DBN qualitatively illustrated the causal relationships between faults and symptoms. Two rules were adopted to isolate faults on the basis of the fault probabilities, with the aim of improving the robustness of the method. The outputs of DBN model were the probabilities of the faults concerned, and the DBN method worked well with uncertain and incomplete information. Zhao et al. [27] proposed a proactive FDD method for VAV terminals. The proactive FDD method produced additional diagnostic information proactively by introducing specific disturbances to a suspected VAV terminal. A list of passive fault detection rules were designed to isolated faults of VAV terminal. The proactive FDD method could overcome the problem of poor diagnostic information in diagnosing VAV terminal faults. Hybrid FDD methods can combine the advantages of individual FDD methods, resulting in better fault diagnosis for VAV systems. Hybrid FDD methods represent an important future direction for research and development in FDD for HVAC systems [28]. A hybrid FDD method may incorporate the limitations of the individual FDD methods. Nonetheless, an appropriate combination of different FDD methods can increase the accuracy and reduce the time duration of FDD [29]. Building management systems (BMSs) have been widely used in commercial and office buildings. The significant developments in data communication, computing, and data visualization technologies, along with the decreasing costs of sensors, actuators, and controllers, have provided an opportunity to better utilize the operating data of HVAC systems in BMS systems for FDD [15]. Herein, given the challenges posed by simultaneous multiple faults and a large amount of unlabeled data, a hybrid FDD method is presented for detecting and diagnosing simultaneous multiple faults of VAV terminals, based on using a self-adaptive model method and layered random forest method. The contributions of this study are as follows: 1) a self-adaptive zone air-temperature model is developed and used to detect faults of VAV terminals; 2) a two-layered random forest-based fault diagnosis method is presented for isolating multiple faults of VAV terminals; and 3) the proposed FDD method is validated based on the operating data of natural faults from an existing building. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 VAV terminal and its typical faults 2.1.1 VAV terminal description VAV terminals are major components in VAV systems. A VAV terminal consists of a damper with a motor, a temperature sensor, an air flow rate sensor, and a VAV terminal controller. The VAV terminal controller consists of two control loops: a zone air temperature control loop and an air flow rate control loop, as shown in Fig. 1 . The VAV terminals maintain the zone air temperature at a setpoint value using these two control loops. The air flow rate setpoint of the air-conditioned zone is determined in the air flow rate control loop according to the measured zone air temperature and its setpoint. A damper is used in the zone air temperature control loop to modulate the air flow rate to the air-conditioned zone according to the measured zone air flow rate and its setpoint. The controller of the VAV terminal is used to dynamically calculate the supply air flow demand ( F s a , d e s ) in the zone according to the zone air temperature ( T z a ), as shown in Fig. 2 . When T z a , s e t , min ≤ T z a ≤ T s a , s e t , max , the supply air flow demand in the air-conditioned zone is determined based on Eq. (1). (1) F s a , d e s = F s a , s e t , max − F s a , s e t , min T z a , s e t , max − T z a , s e t , min ( T z a − T z a , s e t , max ) + F s a , d e s , max where F s a , s e t , max represents the design value of the maximum supply air flow rate in the air-conditioned zone; F s a , s e t , min is the design value of the minimum supply air flow rate in the air-conditioned zone; T z a , s e t , max represents the maximum design value of the comfortable air temperature in the air-conditioned zone; and T z a , s e t , min is the minimum design value of the comfortable air temperature in the air-conditioned zone. When T z a > T s a , s e t , max , the supply air flow demand in the air-conditioned zone is determined using Eq. (2). (2) F s a , d e s = F s a , s e t , max T z a , s e t , max T z a 2.1.2 Typical VAV terminal faults Researchers have conducted onsite comprehensive investigations on the faults of VAV terminals [30,31]. These investigations revealed that the failure rates of the VAV terminals in two commercial buildings were more than 20%. Ten root faults of VAV terminals were identified in these studies. In the present study, half a year of operating data was obtained from BMS systems for VAV systems in a 36-story office building, including normal and faulty VAV terminals. The sampling time interval for the operating data of the VAV systems was 5 min. A fault is defined as a process abnormality or symptom potentially resulting in an acceptable departure range of an observed variable or a calculated parameter. The underline cause of a fault, such as a damper failure, sensor failure, or controller failure, is called the root fault. The operating model of a system with a fault is referred to as the fault pattern of the concerned fault. When the entire VAV system is considered, the controls of the supply air static pressure and supply air temperature are the key issues for the normal operation of VAV terminals. In this study, 13 types of single natural faults (Table 1 ) and 6 types of multiple faults (Table 2 ) were considered. These 19 faults were identified through a field investigation of the office building. The operating data of multiple faults are difficult to acquire in practice. Therefore, only 6 simultaneous-fault situations were considered in this study. Among these 19 VAV terminal faults, a control software fault is easily confused with a VAV controller hardware failure. Controller software faults refer to programming errors, execution failures, and incorrect values of default parameters [32]. They include inappropriate settings for the parameters of a controller, incorrect sequencing logic, and incorrect decision-making logic in energy-saving control strategies. A VAV controller hardware failure can lead to three types of unsatisfactory control performances [33]: an unresponsive control process related to a hardware failure, a sluggish response related to a reduced gain, and oscillatory behavior related to an increased gain [31]. 2.2 Self-adaptive zone air-temperature model 2.2.1 Zone air-temperature model with self-adaptive parameters Thermodynamic models can provide a comprehensive description of the thermal processes of VAV terminals, along with accurate estimations of the various system outputs [4]. In this study, a self-adaptive zone air-temperature model is presented for forecasting the zone air temperature. The heat balance of the well-mixed air in the air-conditioned zone is used to develop the zone air-temperature model, as follows: (3) ρ a ⋅ V z a ⋅ C a ⋅ d T z a d t = F s a ⋅ ρ a ⋅ C a ⋅ ( T s a − T z a ) + Q z a , d e s In the above, C a represents the specific heat of air; V z a is the volume of the zone; F z a represents the volumetric flow rate of air in the zone; T s a represents the supply air temperature; T z a is the zone air temperature; ρ a is the density of air in the zone; and Q z a , d e s represents the design value of the zone cooling load. The discrete expressions of Eq. (3) are as follows: (4) ρ a ⋅ V z a ⋅ C a ⋅ ( T z a , i − T z a , i − 1 ) Δ t = F s a , i ⋅ ρ a ⋅ C a ⋅ ( T s a , i − T z a , i ) + Q z a , d e s (5) T = z a , i ρ a ⋅ V z a ⋅ C a ⋅ T z a , i − 1 + Δ t ⋅ F s a , i ⋅ ρ a ⋅ C a ⋅ T s a , i + Δ t ⋅ Q z a , d e s ρ a ⋅ V z a ⋅ C a + F s a , i ⋅ ρ a ⋅ C a ⋅ Δ t Here, Δ t represents the time interval, and i is the sample number. The self-adaptive parameters k 1 , k 2 , and k 3 are added to Eq. (5) to consider factors such as the zone load estimation error, measurement error of the air flow rate, and measurement error of the supply air temperature. (6) T = z a , i ρ a ⋅ V z a ⋅ C a ⋅ T z a , i − 1 + Δ t ⋅ ( F s a , i + k 1 ⋅ F s a , d e s , i ) ⋅ ρ a ⋅ C a ⋅ T s a , i + Δ t ⋅ k 2 ⋅ Q z a , d e s ρ a ⋅ V z a ⋅ C a + Δ t ⋅ ( F s a , i + k 1 ⋅ F s a , d e s , i ) ⋅ ρ a ⋅ C a + k 3 ⋅ Δ T s a , d u Here, k 1 , k 2 , and k 3 are self-adaptive parameters. k 1 , k 2 , and k 3 are determined by the chaos particle swarm optimization (CPSO) algorithm basing on the operating data, as described in Section 3.2. Δ T s a , d u represents the temperature increase owing to heat transfer in the supply air ducts, and Δ T s a , d u = 3 °C. F s a , d e s represents the design value of the zone supply air flow rate. Fig. 3 shows the proposed self-adaptive zone air-temperature model. The parameter k 1 is used to correct errors in the zone load estimations. The parameter k 2 is utilized to consider the effects of inaccurately measured values of the air flow rate. The parameter k 3 is used to correct the error in the measured supply air temperature owing to the heat transfer in the supply air ducts. If F s a , d e s can be obtained from the BMS systems of real buildings, F s a , d e s is directly used as an input signal to the self-adaptive zone air-temperature model. If F s a , d e s cannot be obtained from BMS systems of real buildings, F s a , d e s is determined using Eqs. (1) and (2). 2.2.2 Chaos particle swarm optimization algorithm for self-adaptive model parameters The CPSO algorithm is an evolutional computing technique based on the swarm intelligence method. In contrast to the particle swarm optimization algorithm, the CPSO algorithm does not become trapped in local optima; thus, the global optimum can be found quickly [34]. The self-adaptive parameters k 1 , k 2 , and k 3 in the zone air-temperature model are tuned via a CPSO optimization method [35]. The model parameters of the zone air-temperature model are determined as follows: (7) φ i = φ i − 1 + k i φ r e f In the above, φ i is a model parameter in the zone air-temperature model, and φ r e f represents the reference value. The reference value φ r e f could be the design value, or any other value with a significant impact on the process. k i ∈ [ − 1 , 1 ] is the self-adaptive parameter and is determined via CPSO, based on minimizing the residuals between the measured and predicted zone air temperatures using an objective function. As the design value is used as the reference value, the self-adaptive parameters should be always in the range of [-1, +1]. (8) f = ∑ i = 1 n μ i ( T z a , m e a , i − T z a , p r e , i ) 2 n Here, n represents the number of measured values. T z a , m e a , i represents the measured zone air temperature at the ith step. T z a , p r e , i represents the predicted zone air temperature at the ith step. μ represents a forgetting factor that gives a higher weight to a more recent value ( i = 1 ) than an older value ( i = n ). 0 < μ < 1 . The prediction error of a traditional zone air-temperature model can increase quickly, as the prediction extends over a longer time interval [36]. Periodically updating the parameters can improve the prediction accuracy of a zone air-temperature model. In this study, the model parameters are periodically tuned by using the CPSO algorithm, which minimizes the error between the measured and estimated zone air temperatures. Optimal values of the model parameters can improve the prediction accuracy of the zone air-temperature model. In this study, the self-adaptive parameters k 1 , k 2 , and k 3 are updated periodically (every 5 h), based on reducing the errors between the measured and estimated zone air temperatures. 2.3 FDD method for multiple faults of VAV terminals 2.3.1 Overview of FDD method for multiple faults of VAV terminals A hybrid FDD method is presented in this paper for detecting and diagnosing simultaneous multiple faults of VAV terminals using a self-adaptive model method and a layered random forest method. The self-adaptive zone air-temperature model is used to detect faults of VAV terminals by comparing the residuals generated by the models and corresponding fault detection thresholds. A two-layered random forest-based fault diagnosis method is presented for isolating multiple faults of VAV terminals, according to the complexity of the fault symptoms. When the representative fault patterns of a particular class of operations can be identified easily, the fault of the VAV terminal has a simple fault symptom. A rule-based fault diagnosis method is suitable when the representative patterns of a particular class of operations can be easily identified [8]. The rule-based fault diagnosis layer is designed to diagnose faults with simple fault symptoms, such as faults 6, 8, 10, and 11. When the representative fault patterns of a particular class of operations are too complex to be identified, the fault of the VAV terminal has a complex fault symptom. The multi-label random forest-based fault diagnosis layer is used to isolate faults with complex fault symptoms, such as faults 1\u20135, 7, 9, 12, and 13. Fig. 4 shows a block diagram of the multi-fault diagnosis method for VAV terminals. The block diagram for the multi-fault diagnosis method consists of an offline training part and an online FDD part. The multi-fault diagnosis method is described in detail below. 1) Step 1: A self-adaptive zone air-temperature model is built offline for each VAV terminal, according to normal historical operating data. The self-adaptive parameters of the zone air-temperature model are tuned using CPSO algorithms, based on 5 h of historical normal operating data. 2) Step 2: New operating data of the VAV systems are fed into the successively built self-adaptive zone air-temperature models. In each iteration, the predicted zone air temperature of the model (Eq. (6)) is compared with the measured zone air temperature. The parameters of the zone air-temperature model are periodically adjusted according to the new operating data. If the residuals between the measured and predicted values exceed fault detection thresholds, faults of VAV terminals are detected. The fault detection thresholds are determined using an online adaptive scheme proposed by Wang et al. [37], based on evaluating the model-fitting error and sensor measurement error under specific operating conditions. The fault detection threshold varies with respect to the operating data of the VAV terminals at 5-min intervals, according to the uncertainty at a certain confidence level. 3) Step 3: Expert rules are used to diagnose the faults of the VAV terminals. Any fault that causes a rule to be satisfied for more than 30 min is isolated. A group of fault candidates can be isolated according to the rules that are satisfied. 4) Step 4: The multi-label random forest method is used to analyze the normalized operating data under the 15 faulty conditions. Multi-label random forest classifiers for the 15 known faults are constructed from the historical operating data. The known-fault library is used to diagnose the fault sources when new operating data are measured. The new operating data are normalized before they are applied to the random forest classifiers, as follows: (9) y i = x i − E i σ i In the above, x i represents the value of the sensor measurement or control signal at the ith time instant. y i represents the normalized value of the sensor data or control signal at the ith time instant. E i represents the moving-window average of the sensor data or control signal at the ith time instant. σ i represents the moving-window standard deviation of the sensor data or control signal at the ith time instant. E and σ are calculated in a recursive manner, as follows [38]: (10) E i = 1 d ∑ k = i − d + 1 i x k (11) E i = E i − 1 + 1 d ( x i − x k − d ) (12) σ i = 1 d ∑ k = i − d + 1 i ( x k − E i ) 2 = 1 d ∑ k = i − d + 1 i x k − E i 2 (13) σ i = σ i − 1 + 1 d ( x i 2 − x i − d 2 ) − ( E i 2 − E i − 1 2 ) Here, d is the number of latest sensor data (or control signals); σ i − 1 represents the moving-window standard deviation of the sensor data or control signal at the (i\u20131)th time instant; and E i − 1 is the moving-window average of the sensor data (or control signals) at the (i\u20131)th time instant. 5) Step 5: Multi-label random forest classifiers are used to analyze the new normalized operating data. There are two aspects to this step. 1) If the new normalized operating data match any known faults in the fault library, the new operating data are labeled with the corresponding fault. Additionally, a group of fault candidates are isolated according to the results of the random forest classifiers. 2) If the new normalized operating data does not match any known faults in the fault library, it indicates that the operating data is from a new fault. Accordingly, Step 4 is repeated, and the new fault will be included in the updated fault library for future fault diagnosis. 6) Step 6: A union aggregation is performed for the fault candidates in the expert rule group and multi-label random forest group, based on comparing the faults in the groups of fault candidates. The FDD results of the multi-fault diagnosis method are obtained. 2.3.2 Rule-based fault diagnosis layer for simple faults Among the 13 types of single faults of the VAV terminals in Table 1, faults 6, 8, 10, and 11 have simple fault symptoms. Four expert rules are designed to isolate faults with simple fault symptoms. Each expert rule is designed to isolate a simple fault, and simultaneous faults that include this same simple fault, as shown in Table 3 . In these four expert rules, T z a represents the measured zone air temperature; T z a , s e t represents the design value of the zone air temperature; P represents the measured supply air pressure; P s e t represents the design value of the supply air pressure; T s a represents the measured supply air temperature; and T s a , s e t represents the supply air temperature setpoint. Thresholds are adopted to eliminate the adverse effects of sensor measurement errors on the fault diagnosis results of the four expert rules. These threshold values are determined heuristically in this study. ε s a represents the supply air temperature error threshold, which is set at 1 °C. ε p represents the supply air duct pressure error threshold, which is set at 30 Pa h 1 represents the low zone air temperature setpoint, which is determined according to the specific conditions. In this study, h 1 is set as 16 °C. These four simple expert rules are decomposed into multiple single-fault violation cases, and one fault candidate is found according to each case. Any fault that causes a rule to be satisfied for more than 30 min is isolated. Nevertheless, it is difficult to isolate faults with complex fault symptoms using this expert rule method. Therefore, the random forest method is used for such faults, as described below. 2.3.3 Random forest-based fault diagnosis layer for complex faults Among the 13 types of single faults in Table 1, faults 1\u20135, 7, 9, 12, and 13 have complex fault symptoms. The multi-label random forest method is used to isolate these 9 single faults and simultaneous faults including these 9 single faults via a binary decision tree-based multi-label technique. The random forest, which was proposed by Leo Breiman [39], is one of the most popular machine-learning algorithms. The random forest has a high classification accuracy and good generalization performance [40,41]. The multi-label random forest turns the original multi-label set into binary sets that can be adequately processed using classical algorithms. Multi-label random forests comprise ensembles of binary decision tree classifiers [42]. They make a final classification decision by integrating the classification results from multiple binary random forest classifiers. A flowchart of a multi-label random forest-based fault diagnosis is presented in Fig. 5 . Assuming that N represents the number of cases in the training set and M represents the total number of variables in the classifier. The detailed multi-label random forest algorithm can be described as follows. (1) A random selection of n training samples from the N training sample sets is performed for each constructed decision tree, using a bootstrap resampling technique. The random selection of the training samples is repeated r times to obtain r sample sets. (2) m variables (i.e., features) are randomly selected from the entire set of variables in the classifier to determine the decision at a node of the tree. Each terminal node is assigned to a certain class. The equation for the random feature selection is as follows: (14) f ( x ) = 1 M ∑ g = 1 M f g ( x ) In the above, M represents the total number of variables (i.e., features). g is the number of variables randomly selected from the entire set of variables. (3) The best split is calculated according to these g variables in the training set. The best split is determined using the Gini index, which can measure the relative impurity of a given element relative to the remaining classes [43]. The Gini index is determined using Eq. (15), as follows: (15) G i n i ( p ) = ∑ i = 1 R y i ( 1 − y i ) = 1 − ∑ i = 1 R y i 2 Here, R represents the total number of classes. y i is the probability of the ith class in the total classes R . (4) Steps (2) and (3) are repeated to grow a decision tree to the maximum size, without pruning. Each terminal node is assigned to a certain class until the evolved results satisfy the termination criteria. (5) The foregoing steps are repeated k times to generate multiple classification trees. In this study, k = 3 . Multiple classification trees are combined to generate the binarized random forest classifier. The test data are distinguished and classified using the binarized random forest classifier. The random forest makes a final classification decision according to the majority voting of the decision tree classifiers. The decision for the binarized random forest is based on the following equation: (16) C x = argmax i = 1,2 { I ( f l t r e e ( x ) = i ) } Here, C x represents the classification result for a test sample x in the binarized random forest. C x = 0 indicates that the classification result for the test sample x is false, whereas C x = 1 indicates that the classification result for the test sample x is true. I ( ) is an indication function [42]. arg ( ) is a value function which represents the number of decision trees that classify the test samples. f l t r e e ( x ) = i indicates that the classification result of the lth decision tree is i . c represents the total number of the classes. In this study, c = 2 . i refers to one class among the c classes. (6) A single fault is isolated by the single random forest in Step (5). Simultaneous multiple faults are isolated by integrating the classification results of the multiple random forest classifiers. 2.3.4 Evaluation metrics for fault diagnosis The F 1 score [44] and the accuracy are used as evaluation metrics to evaluate the overall performance of the proposed FDD method. The accuracy (denoted as A C C in Eq. (17)) is defined as the ratio of the number of true faults that have been diagnosed correctly to the total number of faults. (17) A C C = ∑ i = 1 n ∑ j = 1 c [ 1 − ( q i j − h i j ) 2 ] q i j ∑ i = 1 n ∑ j = 1 c h i j 2 Here, q i j represents the true fault label. ∑ j = 1 c q i j = 0 indicates that there is no fault for the i th sample. ∑ j = 1 c q i j = 1 indicates that there is a type-j fault for the i th sample. h i j represents the predicted fault label. ∑ j = 1 c h i j = 0 indicates that no fault has been detected for the i th sample. ∑ j = 1 c h i j = 1 indicates that a type- j fault has been detected for the i th sample. c represents the number of single faults in the training samples. The recall ( R E C in the equations) is defined as the ratio of the number of true faults that have been diagnosed correctly to the total number of true faults. (18) R E C = ∑ i = 1 n ∑ j = 1 c [ 1 − ( q i j − h i j ) 2 ] q i j ∑ i = 1 n ∑ j = 1 c q i j 2 The F 1 score is an evaluation metric combining the A C C and the R E C , as follows: (19) F 1 = 2 × A C C × R E C A C C + R E C 3 Results 3.1 Zone air-temperature model validation The proposed self-adaptive zone air-temperature model was validated based on the VAV system on the 32nd floor of the building described in Section 2.2. The VAV system consisted of a VAV air handling unit system and 37 VAV terminals. The operating data of the VAV system was gathered and stored in an SQL server at 5-min intervals. The validation dataset consisted of 10 h of operating data (120 samples) for the normal VAV terminal 37. The validation data for the normal VAV terminal 37 was continuously fed into the zone air-temperature model. The initial values of the self-adaptive parameters of the zone air-temperature model were determined by the CPSO algorithm using the previous 5 h of operating data for the normal VAV terminal 37. Then, the values of the self-adaptive parameters of the zone air-temperature model were adjusted periodically (every 5 h), using the last 5 h of operating data. Fig. 6 shows a comparison of the measured and predicted zone air temperatures for the VAV terminal 37 on the 32nd floor. The predicted temperature of the zone air-temperature model appears to fluctuate around the measured zone air temperature. The errors of the VAV terminal 37 between the measured and predicted zone air temperature range from −0.73 to 0.82 °C. The validation results indicate the high accuracy of the proposed self-adaptive zone air-temperature model. 3.2 Data acquisition and preprocessing The operating data of the VAV systems obtained from the building described in Section 2.2 at 5-min intervals was used to validate the proposed FDD method. The operating data included sensor data, control signals, and design data, such as the damper control signal, measured air flow rate in the zone, zone air flow rate setpoint, maximum supply air flow rate setpoint in the zone, minimum supply air flow rate setpoint in the zone, measured zone air temperature, zone air temperature setpoint, measured supply air pressure, and supply air pressure setpoint. To construct the training and test datasets, 10 days of operating data for 13 single natural faults (Table 1) and 6 simultaneous faults (Table 2) were selected from all of the operating data for the VAV systems. The training dataset (20520 samples) was constructed by combining 9 days of operating data for the 19 VAV terminal faults identified through the field investigation of the office building. To cover as many of the various faulty operating conditions as possible, the operating data of different VAV terminals with the same fault were selected and mixed into the training dataset. The test dataset (2280 samples) was constructed by combining another day of operating data for the 19 known VAV terminal faults identified through the field investigation of the office building. Compared with the training dataset, the test dataset included operating data from a different day. In the test dataset, the operating data of the 19 known VAV terminal faults were arranged in ascending order of the fault number. The test data were fed into the FDD method one after another to represent the real-time operation of the VAV system. 3.3 Results of two-layered random forest-based fault diagnosis method The 19 faults considered in this study were successfully detected and isolated using the proposed FDD method. Owing to the large amount of operating data, the operating data for some of the faults are omitted in this paper. The operating data for 7 typical natural faults are presented below. Fig. 7 shows the operating data for the damper fault. The control signal of the damper opening was always 100%. The zone air flow rate setpoint was set as the maximum air flow rate setpoint. The measured zone air flow rate was significantly lower than its setpoint. The measured zone air temperature was significantly higher than the zone air temperature setpoint. Thus, the zone air temperature errors exceeded the corresponding thresholds. The measured supply air static pressure was significantly lower than the supply air static pressure setpoint. A damper fault was diagnosed by using the random forest method. In addition, a low supply air static pressure fault was isolated based on Rule 3. Thus, fault 15 comprising a damper fault and low supply air static pressure fault was detected and diagnosed correctly using the proposed FDD method. Fig. 8 shows the operating data for the VAV controller hardware failure. Both the zone air flow rate setpoint and maximum air flow rate setpoint were 120 L/s. The control signal of the damper opening was always 0%. The measured zone air flow rate was significantly lower than the zone air flow rate setpoint. The measured zone air temperature was significantly higher than the zone air temperature setpoint. The zone air temperature errors exceeded the corresponding thresholds. The measured supply air temperature was significantly higher than the supply air temperature setpoint. In view of the above, a VAV controller hardware failure was diagnosed using the random forest method. In addition, a too high supply air temperature fault was isolated, based on Rule 1. Thus, fault 14 comprising a VAV controller hardware failure and too supply air temperature fault was detected and diagnosed successfully using the proposed FDD method. Fig. 9 shows the operating data for the complete failure of air flow rate sensor. The control signal of the damper opening was always 0%. The measured zone air flow rate was approximately 84 L/s. Both the zone air flow rate setpoint and minimum air flow rate setpoint were 20 L/s. The measured zone air flow rate was significantly higher than the zone air flow rate setpoint. The measured zone air temperature was significantly higher than the zone air temperature setpoint. The zone air temperature errors exceeded the corresponding thresholds. The measured supply air temperature was significantly lower than the supply air temperature setpoint. A complete failure of air flow rate sensor was diagnosed using the random forest method. In addition, A too low supply air temperature fault was isolated based on Rule 2. Thus, fault 16 comprising an air flow rate sensor fault and too low supply air temperature fault was detected and diagnosed accurately using the proposed FDD method. Fig. 10 shows the operating data for the air flow rate sensor reading deviation to the maximum. The control signal for the damper opening was approximately 0%. The zone air flow rate setpoint was set as the maximum air flow rate setpoint. The measured zone air flow rate was significantly higher than the zone air flow rate setpoint. The measured zone air temperature was significantly higher than the zone air temperature setpoint. The zone air temperature errors exceeded the corresponding thresholds. The air flow rate sensor reading deviation to the maximum was isolated using the random forest method. Thus, fault 4 was detected and diagnosed successfully using the proposed FDD method. Fig. 11 shows the operating data for the air flow rate sensor reading deviation to the minimum. The control signal of the damper opening was 100%. The measured zone air flow rate was 0 L/s. The measured zone air temperature was significantly lower than its setpoint. The air flow rate setpoint was set as the minimum air flow rate setpoint. The control signal of the damper opening was always 100%. However, the measured zone air flow rate was always 0 L/s. The measured zone air temperature was significantly lower than the zone air temperature setpoint. The zone air temperature errors exceeded the corresponding thresholds. The air flow rate sensor reading deviation to the minimum was isolated using the random forest method. Thus, fault 5 was detected and diagnosed correctly using the proposed FDD method. Fig. 12 shows the operating data for the case where the maximum air flow rate setpoint was too low. Both the zone air flow rate setpoint and maximum air flow rate setpoint were 150 L/s. The measured zone air flow rate was close to the zone air flow rate setpoint. The measured zone air temperature was significantly higher than the zone air temperature setpoint. The zone air temperature error was significantly larger than the corresponding threshold. Thus, fault 9 was isolated and diagnosed accurately by using the random forest method. 4 Discussions The test dataset described in Section 3.2 was used to verify the proposed FDD method with regard to multiple faults of VAV terminals. Because single faults are special cases of simultaneous multiple faults, the proposed FDD method can isolate both single faults and multiple faults. The fault diagnosis results are presented in Figs. 13 and 14 , including the F1 scores and accuracies for different fault types of the VAV terminal, respectively. The F1 scores and accuracies of the fault diagnosis results were calculated for the test dataset for the 19 known VAV terminal faults. Because the operating data of real VAV systems are dynamic and transient, false fault labels for VAV terminal faults are inevitable for some samples in the fault diagnosis processes. Both the F1 scores and accuracies of the fault diagnosis results are high, indicating that the proposed method is sufficiently precise for large-scale applications. Thus, the 19 VAV terminal faults were successfully diagnosed and isolated using the proposed FDD method. The validation results indicate that the proposed FDD method has a low false-alarm rate, and it can achieve high fault diagnosis performance. The accuracy of the fault diagnosis result depends on the complexity of the fault symptoms and the characteristics of the different fault feature extraction methods. A more complex fault symptom corresponds to a lower F1 score and lower accuracy of fault diagnosis. Both the F1 scores and accuracies of the fault diagnosis were 100% for faults with simple fault symptoms, such as faults 6, 8, 10, and 11. The fault symptoms of simultaneous multiple faults are more complex than those of single faults. Thus, the F1 scores and accuracies for simultaneous multiple faults (faults 14\u201319) were lower than those for the 13 single faults (faults 1\u201313). Both the F1 scores and accuracies of the rule-based fault diagnosis method were 100%. Both the F1 scores and accuracies of the random forest-based fault diagnosis method were lower than 100%. In the random forest-based fault diagnosis of 6 simultaneous faults, the diagnosis accuracy was the lowest (80.1%) for fault 19, and the highest (96.7%) for fault 13. The rule-based fault feature extraction method outperformed the random forest-based fault feature extraction method with regard to the accuracy of the fault diagnosis results. 5 Conclusions A novel FDD method is proposed in this paper for detecting and diagnosing multiple faults of VAV terminals. A self-adaptive zone air-temperature model is presented for detecting faults of VAV terminals. A two-layered random forest-based fault diagnosis method is proposed for isolating faults of VAV terminals. The proposed FDD method is validated based on the operating data of 13 single-fault cases and 6 simultaneous-fault cases from an existing building. According to the results, the following conclusions are drawn. A comparison of predicted and measured zone air temperatures indicates that the self-adaptive zone air-temperature model has a high prediction accuracy. The validation results for multiple natural faults indicate that the self-adaptive zone air-temperature model is effective for detecting faults of VAV terminals. The proposed two-layered random forest-based fault diagnosis method can accurately isolate single faults and multiple faults of VAV terminals. Thus, the proposed FDD method is a reliable and practical technique for dealing with multiple faults of VAV terminals.

        "dc:description": "Fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) can reduce a large amount of energy wasted by faults in variable air volume (VAV) systems. This paper presents a FDD method for detecting and diagnosing multiple faults of VAV terminals using a hybrid method. A self-adaptive zone air-temperature model is presented and used to detect faults of the VAV terminals by comparing the residuals between predicted and measured values with corresponding fault detection thresholds. The model parameters, which are normally constant and determined according to experience from short-period data, are periodically adjusted to improve the model prediction accuracy on the basis of operating data by using a chaos particle swarm optimization algorithm. Moreover, a two-layered random forest-based fault diagnosis method is presented to isolate multiple faults of VAV terminals according to the complexity of the fault symptoms. An expert rule-based fault diagnosis layer is used to isolate VAV terminal faults with simple fault symptoms. A random forest-based fault diagnosis layer is utilized to diagnose VAV terminal faults with complex fault symptoms by adopting a binary decision tree-based multi-label technique. The proposed FDD method is validated using operating data from real VAV systems involving 13 single-fault cases and 6 simultaneous-fault cases. The validation results indicate that the proposed FDD method can accurately detect and diagnose simultaneous multiple faults with only a few independent fault samples and a minimal number of simultaneous-fault samples.",
