Advanced optimization-based control, such as Model Predictive Control (MPC), has been shown to achieve increased energy savings and thermal comfort across different building types and climatic conditions. However, the success of such control algorithms is typically contingent on factors, such as sensor measurements used for the advanced control implementation. In this paper, we specifically investigate the role of occupancy sensors in improving the performance of MPC for a large office building situated in Chicago, IL weather conditions with VAV type HVAC system. Utilizing a detailed simulation-based study involving Occupancy-Based Model Predictive Control (OB-MPC), we infer that occupancy sensing could enable higher energy savings ( ∼ 5% on summer days) and improve thermal comfort relative to a baseline MPC that does not utilize occupancy information. Additionally, we investigate the impact of using occupancy presence sensors versus counting sensors, different levels of occupant density, and varying weather conditions on the control performance. Finally, we perform a systematic investigation of the impact of sensor non-idealities (specifically bias and latency errors) on the performance of OB-MPC algorithms. The study indicates that measurement bias could slightly degrade the realizable benefits of using occupant counting-based MPC (up to ∼ 1% reduction in energy savings and up to 2X increase in thermal discomfort compared to ideal sensing). However, measurement latency may not impact the control performance.

Furthermore, a major contribution of building energy usage stems from Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) energy consumption, which accounts for ∼ 59% and ∼ 36% for residential and commercial buildings respectively [2]. This necessitates the use of monitoring, sensing, and instrumentation technologies for enabling advanced controls of HVAC systems, to achieve increased energy efficiency, thermal comfort and more efficient fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) [3\u20135]. Typically, HVAC systems are designed and operated to condition the entire indoor space based on design occupancy schedules and pre-defined, heuristically determined operational protocols. These preset rules often do not account for dynamically changing internal occupant activity and/or behavior, resulting in energy waste. With the advent of sensing and communication technologies, and the subsequent proliferation of Internet-of-Things (IoT)-based solutions for HVAC energy management in buildings, several studies [6\u20138] have shown that advanced energy management schemes for optimal building operation can be developed to achieve increased energy savings while maintaining occupant comfort. For example, in the paper by Naylor et al. [9], the authors state that depending on the specific use-case, building operators can save between 6%\u201361% energy by accounting for the occupancy information inside the building. In general, the class of building control algorithms which incorporates occupancy information for decision making are broadly referred to as occupancy-based (or occupancy-centric/occupancy-aware controls). Specifically, in these control schemes, the ventilation, heating and cooling set points are defined based on one or more of the following \u2014 the indoor air quality, binary occupancy information (i.e., presence/absence), occupancy count, and occupant behavior [10\u201314], with a view towards optimizing building-level metrics such as energy efficiency. These control strategies can be further classified on the basis of their implementation type, into: (a) rule-based or heuristic controls and (b) optimization-based controls. In (a), the measured occupancy information is utilized to change operational set-points (e.g., temperature setback), or adjust the minimum ventilation rates during unoccupied periods as part of a larger suite of rule-based control sequences [13] such as ASHRAE Guideline 36-based HVAC controls [15]. In (b), the measured or predicted occupancy information is encoded into a model-based optimization formulation as constraints [14]. The effectiveness of these occupancy-based control strategies are evidently reliant on accurate sensing or estimation of the occupancy status in the building zones. Occupancy sensors can be broadly categorized into two major categories. The first category is direct measurement-based sensors, where direct measurement of a physical quantity is done to understand the occupancy levels in a zone. These can include motion type sensors, which detect presence or absence of occupants such as Passive Infra-Red (PIR) sensors, or ambient monitoring sensors as CO 2 (carbon dioxide) sensors, acoustic sensors, light sensors, air temperature sensors and humidity sensors. In addition to measuring presence/absence, some of these ambient monitoring sensors are typically able to estimate the number of occupants as well, thereby providing more resolution to the sensing mechanism. The direct measurement type sensors can also include more sophisticated computer vision-based sensors, including video cameras [16] and depth sensors [17]. The second category is indirect measurement-based sensors, where an additional transferability layer or inference block is applied to convert a proxy signal into a measure of occupancy. Such modes of sensing may include deriving occupancy information from appliance usage patterns and communication network activities. As such, these sensors are also known as virtual sensors. More details, including potential advantages and disadvantages of different occupancy sensing mechanisms have been summarized in Table 5 in Appendix. In related work, authors have identified that sensing non-idealities are critical in modeling zone thermal dynamics and consequently, the performance of occupancy-based controls [18,19]. However, corresponding analyses to determine this impact have been limited in their consideration of sensor error types, building control algorithms and types of buildings. For example, in [20], the authors study the impact of persistent sensor and actuator errors in a specific building type - i.e., core activated office building. Papers such as [21,22] study the modeling of different types of faults in buildings, but they neither focus on sensor attributes nor consider advanced optimization-based controls. In [23], the authors discuss the effects of sensing error, and the impacts of sensor location and quantity on the quality of control performance. However, the premise of the work in [23] is indoor air quality monitoring and does not address the question of energy efficiency. Again, authors in [24] consider the impacts of temperature sensor errors on the performance of building controls, with respect to the metrics of energy efficiency and thermal comfort. Till date, to the best of our knowledge, there has not been any comprehensive investigation of the impact of occupancy sensing, along with their non-idealities, on occupancy-based MPC. Existing work on occupancy-based controls have either focused solely on rule-based controls [13,25] or have focused on proof-of-concept zone-level model predictive control and ideal occupancy presence sensor only [14]. Model predictive control algorithms, in general, are also heavily reliant on the accuracy of the building thermal behavior forecast models. These models include white box models (fully physics based), black box models (fully data-driven) and gray box models (physics-based models, where parameters are learnt through data-driven approaches) [19,26]. Gray box models allow the agglomeration of advantages of physics-based modeling approach as well the benefits of data-driven learning, and as such, are popular modeling choices for MPC in building applications [27,28]. A key aspect of using gray box models is the need for careful estimation of the model parameters. For example, in [29], authors show that a longer window of training data causes overestimation of thermal mass, consequently leading to loss of accuracy. This highlights the need for carefully calibrating the gray box models, in order to ensure effectiveness when these models are used for MPC. For a more in-depth understanding of gray box modeling for building energy applications, the reader is directed to [30]. In this paper, we investigate the impacts of occupancy sensing on occupancy-based model predictive controls (MPC) for a prototype multi-zone large office building. To separate the effect of modeling error from occupancy sensing non-idealities, we developed and carefully calibrated a reduced order model (ROM) of a DOE prototype large office building [31], using a gray box modeling approach. Using this model, we perform Occupancy-Based Model Predictive Controls (henceforth referred to as OB-MPC in this paper) and compare the control performance to a \u201cbaseline MPC\u201d that does not employ any occupancy information. We study the impacts under a diverse set of scenarios, including different sensor technology selections, weather conditions, occupancy density levels and embedded sensor non-idealities. The main contributions of our paper are listed as follows: \u2022 Constructing a gray box reduced-order building zones model for a commercial building, developed through a constrained optimization-based multi-step prediction mechanism and subsequently validated in an open-loop testing. The open-loop model evaluation is important to assess the performance of the model along the MPC prediction horizon when feedback from zone measurements is unavailable. \u2022 Implementation and verification of zone-level and system-level occupancy-based control strategies in the context of MPC and systematic assessment of the controller performance under different occupancy sensor modalities, including sensor type and embedded sensor non-idealities (specifically, measurement bias and latency). The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a detailed description of the building model, its corresponding data-driven reduced-order model, and the baseline MPC algorithm. In Section 3, we discuss the OB-MPC algorithms and provide a compact representation of the control optimization formulation. We describe the simulation-based evaluation framework in Section 4 and detail the numerical studies in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 provides concluding summary and directions for future research. 2 Building model and baseline Model Predictive Control (MPC) 2.1 Large commercial office building model We use a large office DOE reference building [31] for the sensor impact evaluation study. The building has 12 identical floors; however, the 10 middle floors are assumed identical and subsequently represented as an equivalent single floor using thermal load multiplier model. Each of the three floors has a similar layout with five zones (4 perimeter zones and 1 core zone) as shown in Fig. 1. In our study, we consider the core zone to be a conference room and the four perimeter zones to be multi-occupant office spaces. The HVAC system consists of 3 Variable Air Volume (VAV) systems, one for each floor. Each VAV system has an air handling unit (AHU) with two fans and five terminal boxes. The building cooling and heating are supplied by a chilled water system and a gas boiler system, respectively. 2.2 Reduced-order building model MPC relies on a forecast model of the building thermal behavior, including the building envelope and HVAC system. The modeling approach and quality of such models affect both the development cost and operational performance of MPC. A simple, less accurate model is easier to implement and integrate into efficient optimization algorithms while high-fidelity, more accurate model may require sophisticated optimization procedure or solvers and increase the overall computational demand of MPC. Therefore, the question is, how do we derive a relatively simple, yet accurate control-oriented model for MPC? In this paper, we propose a model that combines simplified physical building relationships and data-driven parameter estimation through multi-step prediction error minimization. We consider a discrete time, first order model for the evolution of indoor zone temperatures, as follows: (1) T z , k + 1 = α 1 T z , k + α 2 ( c p m ̇ z , k ( T s , z , k − T z , k ) ) ︸ Q ̇ H V A C , k + α 3 T O A , k + Q z , k i n t . where α ≔ { α 1 , α 2 , α 3 } are time-invariant model parameters estimated from operational data. The additive term Q z , k i n t represents the disturbance term in zone z at time k . Typically, this disturbance term consists of a heat gain component which is contributed by occupant activity (denote this as Q z , o c c , k i n t ), and other heat gain components contributed by non-occupant activities (cumulatively denoted as Q z , n o n − o c c , k i n t ). Mathematically, (2) Q z , k i n t = Q z , o c c , k i n t + Q z , n o n − o c c , k i n t . Similar to [32], we assume Q z , o c c , k i n t = ( N p , k q S C L F ) + ( N p , k q L ) , where q S and q L are the sensible and latent heat gain per person, C L F is the cooling load factor, and N p , k is the number of occupants in zone z at time k . Also, Q z , n o n − o c c , k = A z q H , where A z is the area of zone z , and q H is the approximate per area heat gain from non-occupant sources (such as lights and other equipment), assumed to be constant. Note that in this work, we are using data from a DOE-reference model prototype large office building emulator as training data. In this case, it is observed that a first order model is able to capture the dynamics of the zone thermal model with sufficient accuracy, hence no higher order terms are modeled. However, we note that for models being calibrated with real building data, we may need to include higher order terms to ensure that the constructed model is able to sufficiently capture the system dynamics. 2.2.1 Parameter estimation The objective of the estimator is to identify the time-invariant model parameters by minimizing a multi-step look ahead cost function 1 N L ∑ k = 1 N L T z , k data − T z , k est 2 from training data, where N L is the length of the training data and T z , k is the predicted zone temperature value at time k starting from the measured temperature value at the initial time step k = 0 . Specifically, we formulated and solved the following constrained optimization problem: (3) α ∗ = arg min α 1 N L ∑ k = 1 N L T z , k data − T z , k est 2 , (4) s . t . T z , k + 1 est = α 1 T z , k est + α 2 c p m ̇ z , k data ( T s , z , k data − T z , k est ) + α 3 T O A , k data + α 4 A z , ∀ k ∈ { 0 , 1 , \u2026 , N L − 1 } (5) T z , k est | k = 0 = T z , 0 data , (6) α i ∈ [ 0 , α ̄ i ] , i = 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 . The above optimization problem minimizes a cumulative squared error over the entire training horizon for each zone. The variable T z , k est is the estimated temperature at time k , the parameter α 4 denote the approximate heat gain per unit area from non-occupant sources. The values α ̄ i , i ∈ { 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 } are the permissible upper bounds of the coefficients, which are selected based on the apriori knowledge (rough estimates) of the building thermal mass and other domain-aware considerations. Note that the zone dynamic model in Eq. (4) uses prior estimated temperature value rather than the actual as in the case of conventional least square problem. This ensures that the future potential accumulation errors are explicitly accounted for in the calibration process. 2.2.2 Model validation The training data is generated by running the Modelica-based large office building emulator in open-loop using prescribed supply air conditions (temperature and air flow rate values) and under no occupancy conditions to ensure sufficient transients in the zone air temperature realizations ( T z , k data ) and minimize the influence of the occupancy-based disturbance term ( Q z , o c c , k i n t =0). Note that operational data during non-occupancy (or minimal occupancy) period can also be used for the parameter identification. In the first suite of results, we consider a single-shot validation for a 24-hour long look ahead window, i.e., we assume that temperature measurement is available at k = 0 , and the initial condition is used for the next 24 h prediction. The open-loop model validation results for two representative zones, using unseen/test data are shown in Fig. 2. We observe that the constrained optimization-based strategy is able to predict the zone temperatures evolution with good accuracy over the entire testing horizon. This observation holds true for all the building zones. The error (i.e., difference between the actual and predicted temperatures) distributions for all the 15 zones are shown in Fig. 3. We observe that most instantaneous prediction errors are bounded within [ − 0 . 5 , 0 . 5 ] °C, which highlights the effectiveness of our proposed prediction algorithm. The MPC algorithm runs iteratively in a receding horizon framework, whereby the zone temperature predictions are needed for the optimization at the start of each iteration. Updated measurements of zone temperatures are also available at the start of each of those iterations. This prompts us to study the impact of initial temperature ( T z , k | k = 0 ) resets at varying frequencies (i.e., varying the length of a single prediction horizon), across the length of the overall validation dataset. We consider the standard root mean square error (RMSE) metric, i.e., R M S E = 1 N T ( ∑ k = 1 N T T z , k − T z , k est ) 2 , for this validation task (note that N T is the length of the test dataset). In Fig. 4, we plot the RMSE errors for all 15 zones of our building model, under varying frequencies of initial temperature resets ranging from 15 min (very granular) to 24-hours (single-shot open loop validation). Our results indicate that the prediction errors roughly increase with increasing the frequency of initial temperature reset (i.e., length of a single prediction horizon). However, even for the worst-case prediction i.e., for a single shot 24-hour prediction, the RMSE of the most erroneous prediction across all zones is < 0 . 45 °C (Zone 14). This shows that the proposed method is able to successfully capture the zone temperature dynamics for all building zones with good accuracy. 2.3 System-level models In addition to the zone temperature model, the system-level return air temperature and mixed air temperatures are calculated as follows: (7) T r , k = ∑ z = 1 N z m ̇ z , k T z , k ∑ z = 1 N z m ̇ z , k , (8) T m , k = d k T O A , k + ( 1 − d k ) T r , k . The system level return air temperature is modeled as the weighted averaged of zone temperatures, with weighting factors being the mass flow rate of air for each zone. Additionally, the mix air temperature is also modeled as a weighted sum of outside air temperature and the return air temperature, the weighting factor being the damper position. Furthermore, the heating, cooling, and zone-level reheating energy consumption are modeled using a physics-based modeling approach. Also, we use a data-driven cubic polynomial model to capture system-level fan power consumption as a function of the system-level mass flow rates and the static pressure. This is similar to approaches in [33\u201335]. Note that the polynomial constants for the AHU (system) fan power consumption model are also trained from operational data through a similar least squares-based problem as has been utilized for the zone temperature model. Mathematically, (9) P H , k = c p m ̇ k ( T i , k − T m , k ) + c p ( ∑ z = 1 N z m ̇ z , k ( T s , z , k − T s , k ) ) , (10) P C , k = c p m ̇ k ( T i , k − T s , k ) , (11) P F , k = λ 0 + λ 1 m ̇ k + λ 2 m ̇ k 2 + λ 3 p k 3 ; m ̇ k = ∑ z = 1 N z m ̇ z , k . 2.4 Baseline MPC For brevity, we represent all state variables in our building model (including the dynamically changing zone temperature variables) as x and all input variables (including the zone heating/cooling set-points, the zone-level mass flow rates, the discharge air temperature at both zone- and system-level, and the system-level damper positions) as u . The baseline MPC solves an optimization problem in a receding horizon format, with fixed optimization and control window lengths(set to 90 and 5 min respectively, for all cases in work), to optimize an objective subject to the model constraints as seen by the optimizer. We now describe the different components of the MPC problem as follows: 2.4.1 Objective function In our MPC formulation, denote J k as the objective function at stage k . In this paper, we consider the optimization objective to be the weighted sum of heating, cooling and fan energy consumption, i.e., (12) J k ( x , u , k ) = ( ω H P H , k + ω C P C , k + ω F P F , k ) Δ k . The weighting factors ω H , ω C and ω F can be customized to assign relative importance to the different energy consumption types. The weights were set to 1 for all the case studies presented throughout the paper. 2.4.2 Inequality constraints Typically, the building state variables are constrained within some pre-specified ranges to meet operational requirements. For example, the zone temperatures are constrained between some pre-specified upper (cooling) and lower (heating) set-points, collectively referred to as the thermal comfort bounds. Similarly, the mass flow rates, discharge air temperatures and the system-level damper positions also have pre-specified operational ranges associated with them. Mathematically, (13) T z , l b ≤ T z , k ≤ T z , u b ∀ z , ∀ k , (14) m ̇ z , l b ≤ m ̇ z , k ≤ m ̇ z , u b ∀ z , ∀ k , (15) d k , m i n ≤ d k ≤ d k , m a x , ∀ k , (16) T s , l b ≤ T s , k ≤ T s , u b ∀ k . Furthermore, in order to allow zone (VAV)-level supply air temperatures to be higher than the system (AHU)-level temperatures (in the case of VAV reheat), we have, (17) T s , z , k ≥ T s , k ≥ T s , l b , ∀ k , where T s , l b is the minimum system-level supply air temperature (design consideration). Additionally, note that our model assumes that (18) ( p k , m ̇ k ) ∈ C , where C is the convex hull of p k and m ̇ k . For brevity, let us denote the overall set of all inequality constraints as, (19) G ( x , u , k ) ≤ 0 , where G ( x , u , k ) ≤ 0 collectively represents { (13) , (14) , ∀ z , ∀ k } ∪ { (15) , (16) , (17) , (18) , ∀ k } . 2.4.3 Equality constraints The equality constraints consist of the reduced order models capturing the zone temperature dynamics, and the system-level models. Denote the overall list of equality constraints as, (20) H ( x , u , k ) = 0 , where H ( x , u , k ) = 0 collectively represent { (1) , ∀ z , ∀ k } ∪ { (7) , (8) , (9) , (10) , (11) , ∀ k } . Given the definitions, the overall optimization problem for a window W = { 0 , 1 , 2 , \u2026 , K } can be expressed as follows: (21) ( Baseline MPC ) min u ∑ k = 0 K J k ( x , u , k ) , (22) s . t . G ( x , u , k ) ≤ 0 , k = 0 , 1 , 2 \u2026 , K , (23) H ( x , u , k ) ≤ 0 , k = 0 , 1 , 2 \u2026 , K . In this study, we focus our attention on optimization-based MPC controllers for energy minimization since energy consumption significantly impact commercial building operation budget. However, the MPC constraints are modeled such that zone temperatures and system-level ventilation through outdoor air intake do not violate preset comfort bounds. Note that occupant comfort is also dependent on other factors which drive the indoor air quality, such as CO 2 concentration. However, modeling such details would entail additional contaminant modeling (spatial and temporal), which is beyond the scope of this work. 3 Occupancy-Based Model Predictive Control (OB-MPC) algorithms For Occupancy-Based Model Predictive Control (OB-MPC), the occupancy information is specifically encoded in the MPC optimization constraints. In this paper, we consider three different types of OB-MPC strategies, as described below: 1. OB-MPC-1: Occupancy-aware Zone Temperature Setback: In this scheme, the permissible lower and upper bounds (thresholds) of the zone temperatures (thermal comfort bounds) are modified based on the occupancy status of the zones. Specifically, the MPC algorithm uses more relaxed temperature bounds for unoccupied periods. One must however, ensure that the bounds for occupied and unoccupied periods are not drastically different. This would make it numerically difficult to obtain feasible temperature trajectories, especially if there are multiple contiguous occupied and unoccupied periods. 2. OB-MPC-2: Occupancy-aware System Level Outdoor Air Intake Reset: In this scheme, the minimum amount of fresh outdoor air intake, at the system (AHU) level, is specified as a function of the occupancy in all the zones served by the AHU system. ASHRAE guidelines specify a minimum ventilation requirement per person and per unit area, for maintaining indoor air quality [36]. Occupancy-agnostic design considerations for the minimum allowable flow rate at the system level are based on the maximum capacity of the zones served by an AHU. Therefore, these are often conservative, especially if the zones are sparsely occupied for considerable number of time periods. Thus, adjusting the lower bounds of the AHU outdoor air damper positions (proxy for the outdoor air intake) as a function of actual occupancy information, has the potential to effect more energy-efficient building operation. The relationship between the damper position and outdoor air fraction is typically nonlinear and often depends on other factors such as pressure [37]. For this work, we assume a linear relationship, i.e., d = O A F , where d and O A F denote damper position and outdoor air fraction respectively [37]. Also note that O A F = m ̇ O A m ̇ m a x , where m ̇ O A and m ̇ m a x are the AHU outdoor air mass flow rate and the maximum AHU mass flow rate respectively. Inspired from [13], the outdoor air intake (and hence, the damper) lower bound is specified as: (24) m ̇ O A , m i n , k = 1 E v [ ( ∑ O c c . z o n e s m ̇ P , O A N p , k ) + ( ∑ O c c . z o n e s m ̇ z , A A z ) ] . According to [36], m ̇ P , O A is the ASHRAE recommended minimum outside air mass flow rate per person ( 0 . 003 kg/s ), and m ̇ z , A is the ASHRAE recommended minimum mass flow rate of outside air required per unit area ( 3 . 6 e − 4 kg/s ). E v is a measure of the ventilation efficiency. Without loss of generality, we assume E v = 0 . 75 for our experiments [13]. Note that in (24), m ̇ O A , m i n (and therefore, the damper position lower bound d m i n , k ) is a time-varying variable, owing to its dependence on N p , k , which is the number of occupants in zone z at time k . Therefore, invoking this dynamic damper position lower bound as a constraint in the MPC formulation, directly amounts to incorporating the system-level occupancy-based strategy in the MPC algorithm. 3. OB-MPC-3: Occupancy-aware Zone Level Mass Flow Rate Reset: Similar to OBC-2, under occupancy-agnostic design considerations, the minimum mass flow rate at zone level are also guided by the maximum zone capacity, and not the actual zone occupancy. Therefore, there is potential to save energy by controlling the minimum zonal mass flow rates. In this scheme, the lower bound of the individual zone level mass flow rates is specified as a function of the zone occupancy [13,14]. Mathematically, (25) m ̇ z , l b , k = m ̇ P , S A N p , k + α m ̇ z , l o w A z where A z is the surface area of zone z , N p , k is the occupancy of zone z at time k , m ̇ P , S A is the minimum mass flow rate of zone supply air per person, m ̇ z , l o w is the minimum flow rate of supply air per unit area, and α is a factor of safety. For our studies, we use α = 1 . 7 , unless otherwise specified. Note that m ̇ P , S A is calculated as m ̇ P , S A = m ̇ P , O A 1 − R R A , where R R A is the return air ratio (assumed to be constant at 0.4 for our work, similar to [14]), and m ̇ P , O A is 0.003 kg/s, as specified by ASHRAE guidelines. Additionally, m ̇ z , l o w is calculated as m ̇ z , l o w = m ̇ z , A 1 − R R A , where m ̇ z , A is 3 . 6 e − 4 kg/s , as specified by ASHRAE guidelines. The MPC formulation accounted for this strategy by using Eq. (25) as the lower bound for the zone-level air flow rate. The modified constraints which factor in the occupancy information necessitate the modification of the overall MPC framework described by (12), (19) and (20). Let us assume that G ( x , u , k ) ≤ 0 be decomposed into G 1 ( x , u , k ) ≤ 0 and G 2 ( x , u , k ) ≤ 0 , where G 1 ( x , u , k ) ≤ 0 collectively include the inequality constraints that were modified through inclusion of occupancy information, and G 2 ( x , u , k ) ≤ 0 denote the inequality constraints which remained unaffected after accounting for occupancy information. A similar decomposition is proposed for H ( x , u , k ) = 0 into H 1 ( x , u , k ) = 0 and H 2 ( x , u , k ) = 0 . Based on these definitions, we can represent the occupancy-based model predictive control problem (OB-MPC), under perfect knowledge of occupancy status, as follows: (26) ( OB-MPC ) min u ∑ k = 0 K J k ( x , u , k ) , (27) s . t . G 1 ( x , u , k ) ≤ 0 , k = 0 , 1 , 2 \u2026 , K , (28) G 2 ( x , u , k ) ≤ 0 , k = 0 , 1 , 2 \u2026 , K , (29) H 1 ( x , u , k ) = 0 , k = 0 , 1 , 2 \u2026 , K , (30) H 2 ( x , u , k ) ≤ 0 , k = 0 , 1 , 2 \u2026 , K . In OB-MPC, note that the dynamically changing occupancy-aware thermal comfort bounds, lower bounds on the damper position and lower bounds on the zone air flow rates are encoded within G 1 ( x , u , k ) ≤ 0 . The actual occupancy information is used to compute the occupant-driven disturbance term Q z , o c c , k i n t and hence the zone air temperatures in the overall building control model, more compactly denoted as H 1 ( x , u , k ) = 0 . There are two methodologies to incorporate occupancy information in MPC [14]. These are (i) a measured occupancy-based approach, whereby the measured occupancy status or count at the start time of a look-ahead optimization window ( W ) is assumed unchanged throughout W , and (ii) a predictive occupancy-based approach, whereby a forecast of the occupancy status/count, which may vary for each time stamp of the look-ahead window, is utilized. However, as shown in [14], there is minimal additional benefit to using predictive occupancy profiles in MPC, when compared to the measured occupancy-based approach. We, therefore, implement the measured occupancy-based MPC approach for this study. 4 Sensor impact evaluation framework The impact of occupancy sensing on control performance can be contingent on several different factors. These include technology types, weather conditions, occupant density and behavior, as well as embedded sensor nonidealities. To fully understand the impacts of occupancy sensing on control performance in buildings, we must address the aforementioned factors comprehensively, yet systematically. In this section, we describe a comprehensive impact evaluation framework to address this issue. The schematic diagram of the framework is represented in Fig. 5. In the proposed simulation-based framework, we have a multi-modal input parameter space, where one can instantiate several choices \u2014 including sensor selection (presence/counting), weather conditions, occupancy density etc. Depending on these input choices, a parameter tuple is instantiated with the associated sensor attributes (corresponding to the selected sensor type) and selected endogenous and exogenous conditions. This tuple is then fed to the optimization-based MPC engine for control implementation. For understanding the impact of the sensor nonidealities, we discretize the grid of possible error realizations based on sensor characteristics reported in Table 5 in the Appendix, and perform a parametric sweep over the entire grid of possibilities to quantify impact. Finally, the control performance is evaluated based on a suite of well defined key performance indicators (KPIs), such as energy consumption and occupants\u2019 thermal comfort. The salient elements of the proposed impact evaluation framework are discussed in the following subsections. 4.1 Occupancy sensor non-idealities In this paper, we consider the impact of two important sources of sensor nonideality \u2014 i.e., measurement bias and measurement latency, on the performance of OB-MPC algorithms. Let x and x ˆ denote the true value and sensed value of a physical quantity, respectively. Mathematically, the nonidealities, as injected into the actual measurement can be denoted as: \u2022 Sensor Bias \u2014 an offset in the sensor measurement. i.e x ˆ = x + c , where c is the constant bias, and \u2022 Measurement Latency \u2014 a time delay associated with a sensing system, reflective of the overall communication reliability. Mathematically, x ˆ k = x k − δ , where δ is interpreted as the time delay in sensor measurement. The extent of these non-ideal sensor attributes are typically contingent on several factors, including (but not limited to) underlying technology, device age, application context, and area of deployment [38\u201340]. In general, more accurate occupancy sensors often entail a higher installation cost and operational overheads (such as sophisticated post-processing mechanism for video camera-based sensing), and vice-versa. A summary of the sensor attributes of different types of occupancy sensors, as found from a detailed literature review, is provided in Table 5 in Appendix. In this work, we employ a sensor agnostic approach and focus on a generic class of occupancy sensors which are typically cost-efficient but may have significantly high degrees of embedded non-idealities. For example, CO 2 sensors which measure occupancy as a function of carbon dioxide concentrations (with non-trivial settling time) could have high degrees of error, especially under high occupant density and frequently changing occupancy conditions. 4.2 Occupancy profile generator Occupancy profiles are an integral component to evaluating the impact of occupancy-based MPC controls. In this section, we briefly describe the occupancy profile generator (and associated modeling technique) used for this work, while referring the interested readers to [41] for detailed results. Existing occupancy modeling approaches in the literature include various stochastic models, data mining and machine learning, and virtual reality-augmented methods [42]. Agent-based models [43\u201345] are a class of stochastic models which allow detailed agent-based simulations using agents\u2019 beliefs, intentions and preferences, but lack the mathematical description required for occupancy-integrated predictive building control applications. Different variants of Markov chain models, including inhomogeneous Markov models and hidden Markov models, have been used by the research community \u2014 see, for example, [42,46,47] and the references therein. Inhomogeneous Markov models, in particular, allow for modeling the occupants\u2019 behavioral patterns by accounting for the temporal changes in the duration distributions and transition probabilities of the occupancy states [48]. In other works, various supervised and unsupervised machine learning approaches have been applied to training occupancy models, such as decision tree [49] and k-means clustering [50]. A relatively new and emerging approach to occupants\u2019 behavior modeling centers around virtual reality [51] \u2014 however, the application of that to mathematical modeling of occupancy has not yet been explored. Moreover, occupancy generative models can be classified based on their spatial (e.g., room, zone, or building level) and temporal (e.g, seconds, minutes, or hours timescale) resolutions, as dictated by the specific applications [42,52]. In this work, we resort to Markov-based models for generating occupancy, since those models render mathematical structures that are amenable to analysis in conjunction with model-based building control framework. Specifically, we adopt an inhomogeneous semi-Markov modeling approach to generate sequences of occupancy presence (binary states:occupied or unoccupied) and occupancy counts (i.e., number), at a temporal resolution of minutes, for every zone in a commercial building. Unlike (discrete-time) Markov chains which only models the transitions between the states at different time instants, the semi-Markov processes present a natural way of modeling the occupants\u2019 behavioral pattern by capturing the duration of each occupancy state. However, as these duration distributions, and the associated transition probabilities are expected to vary over the day, we adopt an inhomogeneous semi-Markov modeling approach for learning and generating the occupancy sequences. Each (work) day is divided into equal 30-minutes time windows, and a homogeneous semi-Markov model for occupancy generation (presence/absence and counts) is learnt for each of the 48 time slots. The complete inhomogeneous semi-Markov model for the whole day is then developed by stitching together the individual 30-min homogeneous semi-Markov models. Statistical measures, such as the normalized Jensen\u2013Shannon distance (NJSD) [41,53], are used to quantify the closeness of the learned occupancy models to the historical data. The choice of NJSD as the measure, over some other measures such as the Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence, is partly because NJSD is symmetric, satisfies triangle inequality, and is a true distance metric. We evaluate the performance of the occupancy prediction models using multiple real-world datasets to demonstrate their ability to capture realistic occupancy behavior, by comparing the daily average time-series probabilities of occupancy and the duration distributions of the occupancy states. Further details regarding the occupancy generator model can be found in [41] and is skipped to avoid repetition. 4.3 Sensor error injection to OB-MPC In this section, we discuss how the instantiated sensor error (based on sensor type selected) is injected into the OB-MPC algorithm. Assume that the actual occupancy at time k is N p , k and the associated erroneous sensed occupancy is N ̆ p , k . This erroneous sensing information is utilized to construct the occupancy-based components of the MPC optimization constraints. These include the ventilation constraints (the lower bounds for the AHU outdoor air damper positions and the zonal mass flow rates), and the thermal comfort constraints (i.e., heating and cooling bounds). Furthermore, the erroneous occupancy information is used to predict the evolution of the zone air temperatures. An important point to note here is that, while in Section 3, H 1 ( x , u , k ) = 0 and G 1 ( x , u , k ) ≤ 0 used actual occupancy information (perfect sensing conditions), here they employ the sensed occupancy information with embedded errors. The overall architecture of sensor error injection is summarized in Fig. 6. Note that similar to [14], we use a measured occupancy-based approach, i.e., the occupancy status/count is assumed to remain constant over the OB-MPC look-ahead window. 4.4 Performance metrics In this paper, we use the following key performance indicators (KPIs) as metrics to evaluate control performance. 1. Thermal Discomfort: For each zone, we compute the deviations of the zone temperature from the allowed range during occupied times. The thermal discomfort D z , k at zone z and time k is expressed as the sum of the heating and cooling discomfort, which are given as, Heating Discomfort : D H z , k = max { T z , l b , k − T z , k , 0 } Cooling Discomfort : D C z , k = max { T z , k − T z , u b , k , 0 } , where T z , k , T z , l b , k , and T z , u b , k denote the zone temperature, heating setpoint, and cooling setpoint, respectively for zone z at time k . The time averaged discomfort D ̄ is calculated as (31) Average Discomfort : D ̄ = 1 N L ∑ k = 1 N L ∑ z = 1 N z D H z , k + D C z , k , where N L is the data-length (total number of occupied time slots) and N z is the number of building zones. The change in average discomfort ( D ̄ ) by an OBC strategy x is calculated as, (32) Δ D ̄ = D ̄ b a s e l i n e − D ̄ O B C x . 2. Energy Savings: The % energy savings obtained through an OB-MPC strategy x over a given baseline (for this paper we use \u201cbaseline MPC\u201d as the baseline control) is calculated as, (33) S a v i n g s ( % ) = Energy b a s e l i n e − Energy O B − M P C x Energy b a s e l i n e × 100 . 5 Results and discussions In this section, we present the results of the sensor impact evaluation study. Note that the performance of advanced control for buildings can be influenced by many factors, including uncertainties associated with weather predictions and building usage. Since this paper is focused on evaluating the contributions of occupancy sensors on building controls, we decouple the occupancy effect by assuming perfect knowledge of the other uncertainties. The baseline MPC which serves as a benchmark for comparing the OB-MPCs is described in Section 2, Eqs. (21)\u2013(23). The baseline algorithm does not include occupancy information in the optimization formulation. Specifically, \u2022 We assume d m i n , k = d m i n , d e s i g n , ∀ k , where d m i n , d e s i g n is the minimum damper position, based on design considerations. \u2022 The allowable bounds for indoor zone temperature are not governed by zone occupancy status. Mathematically, [ T z , l b , T z , u b ] is assumed to be the same (i.e., [ 21 , 24 ] ° C ) for a period of 6 am\u20138 pm. The bounds are relaxed to [ 15 , 27 ] ° C between 8 pm and 6 am (i.e., night-time operation). \u2022 The lower bounds for the zonal mass flow rates are also kept constant, based on design considerations ( m ̇ z , l b , k = m ̇ z , l b , d e s i g n , ∀ k ). For all ensuing MPC studies (baseline and OB-MPCs), we fix the length of the decision horizon and look-ahead optimization horizon to be 5 and 90 min respectively. The control strategies are evaluated for a period of 24 h, using the representative peak summer day weather conditions in Chicago, IL, unless otherwise specified. 5.1 OB-MPC performance evaluation under perfect sensing conditions The performance of the OB-MPC algorithms in closed-loop with perfect occupancy information (using error-free sensors) is summarized and compared with the baseline MPC in Table 1. We observe that a simple occupancy-aware temperature setback strategy (OB-MPC-1) is able to save about 1% energy, in addition to improving the thermal discomfort incurred. The control strategies which combine OB-MPC-1 with OB-MPC-2 (AHU outdoor air intake reset) and OB-MPC-3 (zone level mass flow rate reset), improve the energy savings even further. Specifically, the OB-MPC-1 + OB-MPC-2 control strategy yields a 4.09% energy savings while the combined strategy OBC-PK (OB-MPC-1 + OB-MPC-2 + OB-MPC-3) yields a 5.07% energy savings over the baseline MPC (which does not use any occupancy information). Individually, the system-level strategy that optimizes outdoor air intake based on occupancy status and number (OB-MPC-2) has the most impact on energy usage. Further addition of zonal minimum flow rate controls (OB-MPC-3) improves the energy savings, however the amount of additional savings is observed to be < 1%. Although the average percent improvements in thermal discomfort across the OB-MPC strategies are different, they are not practically significant (0.007\u20130.027 °C) and are not expected to result in noticeable differences in occupants\u2019 perceived comfort. While the energy savings (about 5% compared to the baseline MPC) may appear to be modest, the absolute reduction in energy usage is substantial given the annual HVAC energy consumption for such a large office building. Based on our earlier work [54], a 5% savings in annual energy consumption for the large office would amount to ∼ 550 MWh of energy. Assuming an average retail energy price of electricity for IL 2 2 https://www.eia.gov/electricity/state/. (as the location for our current study is Chicago, IL), this amounts to a cost savings of ∼ 52,000 USD. This amount is factored on several variables \u2014 the most important of them being weather and price of electricity. Thus, the cost savings can be potentially higher in warmer states with higher prices of electricity. We now comment on the impact of the studied OB-MPC algorithms on thermal comfort. As observed from our results, the occupancy aware control is able to effectively modify the resultant temperature trajectories to facilitate lesser energy consumption, while simultaneously improving thermal comfort. Figs. 7(a & b) and 8(a & b) respectively show the temperature trajectories for two selected zones (one conference zone, and one office zone), and box plots for the discomfort garnered across all zones, obtained with baseline MPC control. On comparison with Figs. 7(c & d) and 8(c & d) (which are the temperature trajectories and discomfort box plots for the combined OB-MPC strategy under perfect sensing conditions i.e., OBC-PK), we observe that the maximum cooling and heating discomfort value for the occupancy aware control is less. We observe that for office zones, the maximum instantaneous cooling and heating discomforts obtained by employing the baseline MPC are 2.0 °C and 1.0 °C respectively. These values drop significantly to 0.6 °C and 0.3 °C, under the case where all three occupancy-aware control sequences are simultaneously employed (OBC-PK). The maximum cooling discomfort for conference zones is also reduced from 1.5 °C (with baseline MPC) to 0.25 °C (with OBC-PK scheme). Therefore, these results shows the effectiveness of the OBC-PK control scheme in significantly reducing thermal discomfort, while concurrently also achieving energy savings. 5.2 Impact of sensor technology type We now compare the impact of using binary occupancy (presence/absence) sensor versus occupancy counting sensors. Table 2 compares the performance of the OBC-PK reported above (which is based on perfect occupancy counting sensor) to occupancy-aware MPC control that uses perfect knowledge of occupancy presence sensors (binary information only). We observe that the counting-based controller outperforms the binary sensor-based control. Specifically, the controller equipped with only binary (presence/absence) information was observed to have reduced 1.5% less energy, when compared with the OBC-PK case with perfect occupancy counting sensors. Even though the counting sensor was observed to be advantageous for gaining additional energy savings, the difference between the binary and counting sensors, with respect to impact on thermal comfort, was observed to be marginal. 5.3 Impact of varying representative days It is expected that the realizable benefit of occupancy sensing for building controls will vary with changes in weather conditions. For the study, we selected three additional representative days \u2014 Day 150, 215, and 234, which correspond to select days in the spring to late summer and cover peak and shoulder seasons of Chicago, IL. As shown in Fig. 9, the energy savings across the representative days are consistent, ranging from 5.05% to 5.54%. Moreover, the studied OB-MPC algorithms also result in improved thermal comfort across all the selected days, as shown in Fig. 10. 5.4 Impact of varying occupancy densities Occupancy behavior and schedule typically have a direct effect on the energy saving potential of OB-MPCs in building HVAC systems. To investigate the sensitivities of different occupancy densities on the energy savings, we generated three tiers (i.e., high, medium, and low) of occupancy profiles using the stochastic occupancy generator described in Section 4.2. The tiers are defined by the number of occupants and the duration of occupancy per zone. Fig. 11 shows the spread of energy consumption across 20 scenarios per occupancy level and Table 3 presents the average energy savings over the 20 scenarios per tier. Overall, we infer that the energy savings potential of OB-MPCs is highest when the building is sparsely occupied (low occupancy case). 5.5 Impact of sensor errors \u2014 Bias and latency As mentioned in Section 4, we consider two types of non-idealities in this paper \u2014 sensor bias and latency. Our choices of the sensor error distributions for different zone types and categorized sensor types are guided by our aforementioned review of literature related to sensor error characteristics summarized in Table 5 (please refer to the Appendix), the knowledge of the building layout, and some common engineering assumptions. The sensor error distributions for the sensor bias and measurement latency are simplified as a discrete integer pool. Moreover, the occupancy counting sensors in the same zone type are considered to have the same sensor error distributions. In this section, we present the impact of sensor non-idealities on the performance of OB-MPC strategies. For the study, we selected a discrete set of sensor latency and bias values. The latency values of 0\u201315 min are practical choices for the type of sensor technology we consider in this work, i.e., inexpensive sensors with the possibility of high degrees of associated errors. The bias values are selected as a maximum of ± 50 for the conference rooms (with capacity 136) and ± 4 for the (large) offices (with capacity 17) with the minimum occupancy level set to 0. Also, the combined control strategy OBC-PK is selected for the study. The results, summarized in Tables 4 and Fig. 12(a & b) indicate that measurement latencies of 5 and 15 min do not have a significant impact on the energy consumption. Although these imperfections affect the average thermal discomfort across all zones, the average discomfort, which corresponds to the 15 min latency, is still less than ± 0 . 020 ° C , on average. Compared to sensor latencies, we observed that the sensor biases have a more significant impact on energy savings and thermal comfort. The realizable energy savings from perfect occupancy sensors can reduce by up to 0.91% in the positive bias case and the thermal discomfort can increase by a factor of almost 2 in the negative bias cases. Also, as shown in Fig. 13(c & d), the negative bias case resulted in increased instances of appreciable cooling discomfort, compared to the same day\u2019s perfect sensing case (OBC-PK), as shown in Fig. 8(c & d). For the case of positive bias, we can observe from Fig. 13(a & b) that there are instances of potential overcooling, especially in conference zones. Subsequently, this led to an increase of heating discomfort, i.e., excursion below the lower bound of comfort. 5.6 Summary of results We performed a comprehensive evaluation of control performance for advanced occupancy-based model predictive control (OB-MPC) algorithms with the selected large office emulator model. Our evaluation was done across four different days of the year, to account for variation in cooling weather (peak-summer versus fringe summer months). Additionally, we performed our assessments under different occupancy densities, thus reflecting differing levels of occupant presence in buildings. We also performed an error impact study considering a generic class of occupancy sensors which are prone to non-idealities. We infer, from the study, that the studied OB-MPC algorithms can enable higher energy savings and significantly reduce thermal discomfort (especially low probability high impact occurrences of high instantaneous discomforts), when compared to a baseline which does not use any occupancy information. Note that in our study, we compute the percentage energy savings for OB-MPC sequences considering an occupancy-agnostic MPC solution as the baseline. The baseline MPC is comparatively more efficient than rule-based sequences. Therefore, the reported percentage savings through utilization of OB-MPC are expected to be much higher, when considering rule-based controls as the comparison baseline. Also, note that even though the additional benefit brought about by using occupancy information may not appear to be significantly high, it is expected to bring about non-trivial operational cost savings, as mentioned in 5.1. However, such advantages can likely decrease with sensor errors, among which the bias error is observed to be more significant than measurement latency. 6 Conclusions and future work In this paper, we provide the impact of occupancy sensing on the performance of advanced control algorithm \u2014 MPC. Specifically, we devised a building model using a combination of data-driven and physics-based modeling techniques for a prototype large office building and used it to test the efficacy of occupancy-based MPC control schemes. Our results, generated under a diverse set of scenarios, indicate that occupancy sensors enables additional HVAC energy savings (over baseline MPC that does not utilize occupancy information) and improved thermal comfort. Such benefits are most pronounced under low building occupancy density. However, the realizable benefits may decrease due to sensor non-idealities, such as bias and latency errors. While parametric study could provide detailed information about the full impact spectrum, they are resource and time intensive. In many cases, one may be interested in understanding the worst-case impact only. As a future work, we will utilize smart sampling based techniques (e.g., Bayesian optimization-based sampling) to efficiently transverse the input space and identify the sensing and control scenarios that optimize a prescribed evaluation criteria. Moreover, we will extend the sensor impact evaluation tool-set to cover other building sensors and performance metrics, such as demand flexibility. Demand flexibility is a key component of decarbonization strategies and building controls play a key role in achieving energy flexibility from demand-side resources. The impact of different types of sensors in accurately achieving such flexibility-oriented grid services from grid-responsive buildings is an important and timely research question.

        "dc:description": "Advanced optimization-based control, such as Model Predictive Control (MPC), has been shown to achieve increased energy savings and thermal comfort across different building types and climatic conditions. However, the success of such control algorithms is typically contingent on factors, such as sensor measurements used for the advanced control implementation. In this paper, we specifically investigate the role of occupancy sensors in improving the performance of MPC for a large office building situated in Chicago, IL weather conditions with VAV type HVAC system. Utilizing a detailed simulation-based study involving Occupancy-Based Model Predictive Control (OB-MPC), we infer that occupancy sensing could enable higher energy savings ( ∼ 5% on summer days) and improve thermal comfort relative to a baseline MPC that does not utilize occupancy information. Additionally, we investigate the impact of using occupancy presence sensors versus counting sensors, different levels of occupant density, and varying weather conditions on the control performance. Finally, we perform a systematic investigation of the impact of sensor non-idealities (specifically bias and latency errors) on the performance of OB-MPC algorithms. The study indicates that measurement bias could slightly degrade the realizable benefits of using occupant counting-based MPC (up to ∼ 1% reduction in energy savings and up to 2X increase in thermal discomfort compared to ideal sensing). However, measurement latency may not impact the control performance.",
