To reduce the stress on the electrical grids during peak periods, pre-charging the building envelops with high thermal mass during off-peak periods and utilizing the stored energy during peak periods is an effective approach. However, most of the residential buildings in North America are generally built with lightweight materials, and the concrete slabs in the basement are the only option for energy storage. This means, heat storage is possible only in the basement, and achieving the peak shifting in the entire house is a challenge. To extend the peak shifting to the entire building, an automated heat extraction system (HES) that transfers the stored heat from the basement to the other parts of the house is desirable. Accordingly, this study developed two advanced controllers, which controls both electrically heated floor (EHF) (for energy storage in the basement) and HES (for transferring the stored heat to other parts of the house), to achieve peak shifting and heating cost-saving while guaranteeing the occupants\u2019 thermal comfort. The performance of the developed controllers was compared with other control strategies (i.e., constant set-point control, rule-based control and self-learning predictive control). The results showed that the developed advanced controllers effectively shift the energy consumption from the peak period (97 % for the basement and ~87 % for the second floor) and decrease the heating cost by ~33 %.

To meet the increasing energy demand in buildings and reduce its effect on the environment, various renewable energy sources are used to meet the buildings' energy requirements. However, due to intermittent nature of renewable energy sources, bridging the gap between energy generation and consumption becomes a challenge [2]. Besides, due to occupant living habits and climatic factors, energy consumption in a building usually follow specific patterns and high energy demand could happen in certain periods of the day [3]. For instance, peak energy consumption in a residential building might occur in the morning or late afternoon in winter due to space heating and occupants\u2019 activities. The peak demand could increase the stress on the grid and result in an additional electricity bill for consumers if time-of-use tariffs or critical peak pricing (CPP) are adopted. To resolve the mismatch between energy generation and consumption and to ease the peak demand of a building, various energy storage systems (e.g., battery [4,5], water/ice storage tank [6,7], or building envelopes [8\u201311]) are widely used to store the energy during off-peak periods and utilize it later during peak periods. Among these systems, building envelopes (i.e., walls, ceilings, and floors) constructed with high thermal mass materials, known as building-integrated thermal energy storage (BITES) systems, are commonly used for thermal storage considering that there is no additional space or cost involved. In recent years, many researchers proposed effective control strategies for the BITES system to shift the peak load in buildings. These control strategies could be classified into two main types: non-predictive control and predictive control [12]. Non-predictive control strategies, which do not contain prediction ability, generally set different indoor set-point temperatures for the HVAC system during different periods. Rule-based control (RBC), which sets indoor set-point temperature based on rules defined by the users, is one of the simplest and easy-to-use non-predictive control strategies. Zhu et al. [13] proposed an RBC for a cooling system to store energy in a building envelope integrated with phase change material (PCM). The proposed RBC strategy achieved a 20 % peak load reduction in an office building. Reynders et al. [14] applied an RBC to store energy in the building envelope thermal mass which was able to shift up to 75 % peak load. Although the RBC is widely used, it is still limited by some drawbacks: unable to accurately predict the load and cannot provide the optimal control signal. To overcome the limitations of non-predictive control strategies, model predictive control (MPC) can be utilized. MPC predicts the building energy demand using a predictive model, and then it solves an optimization function formulated based on the predictive results to get the optimal control schedule [15]. The predictive models in MPC could be classified as physical models, hybrid models, and data-driven models. Physical models predict the energy demand of a building by numerical equations that consider detailed physical properties of building materials and characteristics. In contrast, data-driven models discover statistical patterns of a building's thermal behavior from the available historical operation data. The hybrid model is a combination of physical models and data-driven approaches. To develop a physical building model for a MPC, software such as EnergyPlus [16,17], TRNSYS [18], IDA ICE [19], Modelica [20] could be utilized. For instance, Pavlak et al. [21] developed a resistance-capacitance (RC) model-based MPC and implemented it in an office building to reduce peak demand. The experimental results showed that the peak load could be shifted by 1.2\u201318.1 %. On the other hand, to develop data-driven models, a variety of approaches could be selected, such as linear regression [22], support vector machine [23,24], artificial neural network [25,26], deep learning [27\u201329], etc. A detailed review of data-driven approaches has been summarized by Sun et al. [30]. In the literature, data-driven based MPC has been suggested as an effective method to control the BITES to shift the peak load in buildings [22]. Besides, due to the ability to solve constraint optimization problems, the MPC could achieve optimal peak shifting [30], cost-saving [31,32], and CO2 emission reduction [31,33], considering thermal comfort. Furthermore, MPC could also be utilized to integrate BITES and other systems, such as shading [34], power generation [35]. However, besides its advantages, challenges in developing MPC for peak shifting in buildings should be considered: (1) developing predictive models could be time-consuming. Because each building has its unique thermodynamic, the predictive model(s) in the MPC should be constructed from scratch when implementing it to other buildings; (2) the predictive performance of the model should be guaranteed. Because the optimization process of MPC utilizes the output of the predictive model, the predictive model's accuracy could affect the performance of the MPC; (3) the optimization process could be complicated when using MPC to integrate the operation of BITES and other systems. 1.1 Research gap To decrease the time required for developing a specific predictive model and solving an optimization problem, Thieblemont et al. [3] developed a self-learning predictive controller for the operation of electrically heated floor (EHF) in a residential building. This study showed that the self-learning predictive controller could shift the heating load in the basement by 98 %. The self-learning predictive controller's performance was further investigated and proved in Refs. [36,37] with some modifications. However, they mentioned that in North America, most residential houses are wood structured and only the floor in the basement is constructed with high thermal mass material (concrete). This means that energy storage during the off-peak period is possible only in the basement, and achieving the peak shifting in the entire house is a challenge. To extend the peak shifting potential of partially installed EHF, Sun et al. [38] introduced a heat extraction system composed of a fan and ducts to transfer the stored heat from zones with high thermal mass (basement) to the other zones without BITES. However, in their study, the effectiveness of HES has only been studied with manual control. Limitations of previous related works are (1) the developed self-learning predictive control strategy only worked on EHF to store the heat energy in the basement, and hence, only rooms with high thermal mass could store energy and shift the peak load [3], [36], [37]; (2) the HES was operated manually without any link to EHS and the integrated performance of the EHF and HES control system needs to be investigated to ensure the maximum peak shifting in the entire house without compromising the occupant's thermal comfort [38]. 1.2 Objectives and uniqueness of the study This study's main objective is to develop two new advanced controllers that could automate the peak shifting process by simultaneously controlling the operation of EHS and HES to enable the peak shifting and heating cost-saving in the entire building without compromising the occupant thermal comfort. To demonstrate the advantages of the developed advanced controllers, its performance (in terms of peak shaving potential, occupant thermal comfort and heating cost-saving analysis) was compared with the existing control strategies (constant set-point control, rule-based control and previously developed self-learning predictive control) and the results are presented. The uniqueness of the proposed advanced controllers are: (1) it can automate and integrate the operation of EHF and HES to extend the peak shifting ability of a building with partially installed high thermal mass envelopes compared to the previously works [3], [8], [38]; (2) it can be implemented in a building without requiring historical data or building characteristics. The proposed controllers could predict the next day's demand by an energy prediction model that is trained by a self-learning process: the energy consumption of the building for certain weather conditions are stored in the energy prediction model and the next time, the same weather condition occurs, the controller refers to the previously stored energy consumption data. The more the similar weather condition occurs, higher the accuracy of energy prediction model. Then, the controller self-learns the energy consumption trend of the building and updates the energy consumption profile, if there is any change. The entire process is automatic and makes it easier for the users to implement the controller in their building without much of any intervention. The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the details of the experimental house and the TRNSYS - MATLAB model. Section 3 presents the proposed advanced controllers and other existing controllers (i.e., constant set-point control, rule-based control, and self-learning predictive control). Then, in Section 4, the analysis procedure for selecting proper upper bound floor surface temperature and comparison between controllers have been explained. Section 5 summarizes the results and discussion of this study. Section 6 presents the conclusions. 2 Experimental and modeling platform In this section, the detailed description of the experimental house and the HES, and the TRNSYS-MATLAB model are presented. 2.1 Experimental house and HES details The schematic of the studied two-story residential building integrated with a HES is shown in Fig. 1 , while the floor plan of the experimental house is presented in Fig. 2 . The considered building is in Quebec, Canada, and its building area is 144 m2 per floor. Note that the building is built with a wooden-frame structure without any considerable thermal mass. It shows similar characteristics to around 1.6 million typical detached houses in Quebec, Canada [39]. Two main types of heating systems are used in the experimental building: electrical baseboard heaters (EBHs) and electrically heated floor (EHF) system. EBHs are utilized on the ground floor and the second floor, while surface EHFs are mainly located at the ground floor and buried EHFs are installed at the basement. Among the EHFs, the surface EHF installs the electrical heating wires below the floor surface (ceramic) and above a 60 mm-thick concrete slab, while the buried EHF places the electrical heating wires in the middle of a 152 mm-thick concrete slab (as shown in Fig. 3 ). The buried EHFs in the basement act as the sensible heat storage system. The thermo-physical properties of the burried EHF in the basement is presented in Table 1 . Note that EHF and EBH are controlled by the thermostats in each room (shown as red blocks in Fig. 2). As mentioned in Section 2.1, the floors above the ground have a lower thermal mass. To exploit the heat stored in the concrete slab of the basement, the HES was used to transfer warm air from the basement to the second floor. The HES consists of a fan and ducts (see Fig. 1). Table 2 shows the measured performance characteristics of the installed fan of HES in the investigated residential building. In this study, critical peak pricing (CPP, as shown in Table 3 ) is implemented to encourage consumers to shift their electricity demand and ease the press of the grid [41]. The peak period and off-peak period for the CPP are presented as white and black portions, respectively, in Fig. 4 . Note that although the electricity price of the second off-peak (9 a.m.\u2013 4 p.m.) is the same as the first off-peak period (8 p.m.\u2013 6 a.m.) in CPP, the stress on the grid is higher during the second off-peak period. Therefore, shifting the load from the second off-peak period should be considered in this study to avoid creating a new peak. 2.2 TRNSYS - MATLAB model The performance of the advanced controllers was investigated using the TRNSYS-MATLAB model developed based on the experimental house mentioned in section 2.1. It is to be mentioned that the same experimental house was used in the previous works of the authors [8,38] and hence, previously developed TRNSYS model was used in this study. The novelty of the paper lies in the development of advanced controllers using MATLAB, its integration with TRNSYS model and the performance of the developed controller (in terms of peak shifting ability, heating cost savings and thermal comfort) was compared with the other control strategies (explained later in section 3.2). The major components of the developed TRNSYS - MATLAB model is shown in Fig. 5 . The detailed description of each component is given below: Exterior condition: Type 15 imports the weather information from the weather data file. The weather data file was obtained from Jean Lesage International Airport, Quebec City, Canada, the closest weather station to the experimental building [42]. The weather information includes ambient temperature, wind speed, solar radiation, and air pressure. These parameters could be utilized to calculate the air infiltration by multi-zone airflow part (explained later in this section) and simulate the building's energy demand and indoor air temperature by multi-zone building part (explained later in this section). The imported information is also utilized to calculate the exterior soil temperature, which impacts the heat transfer between the building envelopes below the ground and the soil. Multi-zone building: Type 56 simulates the zonal air temperature, floor surface temperature, and zonal energy demand of the multi-zone building based on the building characteristics and inputs from other components (i.e., exterior condition, multi-zone air flow, HES, and controller). Multi-zone air flow: Type 97 (an integrated CONTAM model [38]) simulates air infiltration and inter-zonal air flow, based on the exterior condition, internal air temperature of different zones (provided by multi-zone building part), and the parameters of HES. HES: The HES is modeled using a variable speed fan (Type 111a). The HES is controlled by the controller (explained later in this section) to transfer the air from the basement to the second floor. The input air temperature of HES is the same as the indoor air temperature of the zone in the basement from where the hot air is extracted, while its output temperature is calculated based on the temperature increased by the fan and temperature decreased through heat loss through the duct. Controller: The controllers are programmed using MATLAB and integrated into the TRNSYS model using type 155 (as shown in Fig. 5 with red box). It should be mentioned that the TRNSYS model was developed by the authors in their previous studies [8,38] using the controller (Type 108) as setpoint control strategy. However, the advanced controllers could not be implemented in TRNSYS due to their complexity. Therefore, the Type 155 (MATLAB) replaced the TRNSYS model's controller (Type 108) to formulate the developed advanced controllers that control the building energy consumption and indoor temperature. Therefore, in the TRNSYS-MATLAB model developed in this study, the control strategies are programmed in MATLAB while the indoor conditions are simulated in TRNSYS. Note that the validation of the developed TRNSYS model shall be found in previous research works of the authors [8,36,38]. The present study aims to investigate the performance of developed controllers instead of model development and validation. Therefore, model validation details were not repeated in this paper. 3 Controller description In this study, two advanced controllers were proposed (advanced controller with upper bound for floor surface temperature and advanced controller with HES operation) to integrate and automate the operation of EHF, HES to extend the peak shifting possibilities in a building (with partially installed high thermal mass envelops) while maintaining thermal comfort. The proposed controllers were compared with three types of existing control strategies (i.e., constant set-point control, rule-based control, and self-learning predictive control) through an analysis procedure that is presented in Section 4. In this section, a detailed description of the studied control strategies is presented. 3.1 Advanced controllers Fig. 6 depicts the working process of the advanced controllers; 1) Advanced controller with upper bound for floor surface temperature and 2) Advanced controller with HES operation. As shown in the figure, the proposed controllers contain two main components: the high-level controller and the low-level controller. The high-level controller predicts the next day's heating demand based on the self-learning process and then provides an energy consumption schedule to operate the EHF for the following day. Then, the low-level controller acts as a supervisory controller, which decides whether to apply the control signal from the high-level controller by considering the required thermal comfort. Note that the two proposed advanced controllers have the same high-level controller, while the main difference between the two advanced controllers exists in the low-level controller. A detailed explanation for these two advanced controllers is given in the following subsections. 3.1.1 Advanced controller with upper bound for floor surface temperature In this section, the explanation would be given in the order of high-level controller and low-level controller: High-level controller: The high-level controller's role is to forecast the energy to be stored in the EHF and accordingly determines the heating schedule for the following day. The proposed high-level controller includes three models (i.e., weather prediction model, energy prediction model, and scheduling model) and two analysis procedures (i.e., building response analysis and HES operation response analysis). (1) The weather prediction model obtains the next day's hourly weather forecasting information (exterior temperature and weather conditions, such as \u2018sunny\u2019, \u2018cloudy\u2019 or \u2018rain\u2019, etc.) and converts it to half-daily ambient temperature and solar radiation categories [Ti, Si], where Ti is the half-daily temperature category, and Si is the half-daily solar category. Note that the half-daily categories could be further classified as [Ti, Si]morning and [Ti, Si]afternoon, representing the category for the first half day and the second half-day, respectively. In this study, fourteen temperature categories are interval grouped by taking −40 °C as the minimum temperature, 30 °C as the maximal temperature, and 5 °C as the interval. For instance, if the minimal half-daily ambient temperature is −2 °C, then its Ti would be [-5 °C, 0 °C]. Similarly, three solar categories (i.e., sunny, mild, and cloudy) are created. (2) Based on the half-daily temperature-solar categories, the energy prediction model predicts the next day's energy demand (E_Con in Fig. 6). The detailed prediction process is shown in Fig. 7 : if the controller is implemented to a building for the first time, E_Con would be equal to a default initial value E_ini. Otherwise, E_Con would be set as the minimal value of the modified historical energy consumption (E_Modified) for the corresponding weather category. Note that this prediction model is trained by the building response analysis and HES operation response analysis modules. The process of training the energy prediction model by modifying corresponding energy consumption for each temperature-solar category is called the learning process, see Fig. 7. The learning process works by the following steps: At the end of a day, in the HES operation response module, the amount of energy transferred by the HES during the off-peak period for each half-day (E_HES_Mod) is calculated. Then, in the building response analysis module, an adjusted energy consumption (E_adjust) for each half day is calculated through the applied energy by EHF (E_app) minus E_HES_Mod. Then, the expected energy consumption (E_Modified) for the corresponding weather category would be modified. Finally, E_Modified is stored in the database of the corresponding weather category in the energy prediction model. (3) Finally, the scheduling model calculates the next day's power level and heating duration for EHF: To charge the concrete in the basement, the heating power is fixed to 80 W/m2 for the first off-peak period (8 p.m.\u2013 6 a.m.) and 10 W/m2 for the second off-peak period (9 a.m.\u2013 4 p.m.). The heating duration is calculated through dividing half-daily E_Con by this power. If the duration exceeds the off-peak periods, the power would be increased to 120 W/m2, and the heating duration would be calculated accordingly to avoid heating during peak periods. To maintain thermal comfort during the entire peak period, after the off-peak period the heating period is scheduled to stop heating at the end of the off-peak period. For instance, if the first half day's heating duration is 4 h, the EHF would be turned ON at 2 a.m. Low-level controller: The low-level controller is proposed to achieve timely supervision and to ensure thermal comfort. The low-level controller principle for the advanced controller with an upper bound for floor surface temperature is shown in Fig. 8 . It maintains thermal comfort by setting the upper bound for the floor surface temperature ( T f l o o r \u203e ), lower bound ( T a i r \u203e ) and upper bound ( T a i r \u203e ) of acceptable indoor temperature. Fig. 8 shows that the advanced controller with an upper bound for floor surface temperature operates the HES at the highest speed during peak periods to transfer the stored energy to rooms without significant thermal energy capacity. Besides, for all times of the day, if the floor surface temperature exceeds T f l o o r \u203e , EHF is turned OFF immediately to avoid the occupants\u2019 thermal discomfort caused by overheating/overshooting. On the other hand, if the indoor air temperature of the basement Tair drops below T a i r \u203e , the EHF is turned ON immediately, and the EHF is turned OFF if Tair is higher than T a i r \u203e . If the indoor air temperature is kept within the acceptable range [ T a i r \u203e , T a i r \u203e ], the low-level controller will implement the control signal received from the high-level controller. Note that properly selected T f l o o r \u203e could ensure thermal comfort and complete charge of EHF during off-peak periods. Therefore, this study does a case study (see Section 4.1) for setting proper T f l o o r \u203e . Besides, the appropriate setting of T a i r \u203e and T a i r \u203e could shorten the initial period required for the advanced controllers to become stable. Thus, T a i r \u203e and T a i r \u203e are set at 21 °C and 23 °C, respectively, based on the parametric study of Thieblemont et al., [3]. 3.1.2 Advanced controller with HES operation The major difference between the advanced controller with HES operation and the advanced controller with an upper bound for floor surface temperature is in the low-level controller. The low-level controller of the advanced controller with HES operation is shown in Fig. 9 . To ensure complete charging of EHF without compromising the thermal comfort, it operates the HES at different levels (i.e., fan speeds) during the off-peak period to transfer energy from the potential overheated area to other areas. Note that this strategy also helps preheating other rooms during the off-peak period. In the figure, levels 1, 2, and 3 are the HES fan speeds, which are explained in Table 2. 3.2 Existing control strategies 3.2.1 Constant set-point control Constant set-point control, which implements constant set-point temperature to all periods, is the most used control strategy in practice. In this study, 21.5 °C is selected as the constant set-point. This simple control strategy can maintain thermal comfort; however, it cannot meet peak shifting requirements. 3.2.2 Rule-based control (RBC) RBC strategies are static controllers that set operation modes based on human intelligence, heuristics, or mathematical models [43]. Commonly used RBC to achieve peak shifting for heating is to set higher set-point temperature for off-peak periods and lower set-point temperature for peak periods. Therefore, this strategy could pre-charge the thermal storage system during off-peak periods and discharge during peak periods without using the building load prediction model. Considering the building's thermal mass and the variation of external temperatures, an indoor air temperature span of ±2 °C is recommended to prevent thermal discomfort [44]. Thus, in this study, the peak and off-peak set-point of the rule-based control is defined at 21.5 °C and 23.5 °C, respectively. Detailed information is shown in Fig. 10 . 3.2.3 Self-learning predictive control The principle of self-learning predictive control is shown in Fig. 11 . The difference between the previously developed self-learning predictive control [3] and the developed advanced controllers in this study is that the self-learning predictive control does not consider the operation of HES. Subsequently, the HES operation response analysis module was not included in the learning process. Besides, in the low-level controller of self-learning predictive control, the HES operation and upper bound for floor surface temperature are not considered. More details on the working algorithm of the self-learning predictive control can be found in Ref. [3]. 4 Analysis procedure In this study, two case studies are investigated through simulation on the experimental house's TRNSYS model: The first study is to select proper upper bound floor surface temperature for the advanced controller. The second study is to compare the developed advanced controllers to other existing control strategies. Note that all cases are simulated from January 1, 2018 to March 1, 2018, with 5 min time interval. 4.1 Selection of upper bound floor surface temperature As described in Section 3.1.1, for the advanced controller with upper bound floor temperature, if the measured floor surface temperature exceeds T f l o o r \u203e , the EHF in the basement would turn OFF. However, temperature overshoot in the basement could still occur because there is a time delay between turning OFF the EHF and decrease of the indoor temperature. Additionally, another disadvantage of unsuited T f l o o r \u203e is that intermittent operation of EHF during the off-peak period cannot guarantee complete charging, which means the stored energy might be insufficient to cover the peak load. Thus, determining the appropriate T f l o o r \u203e in the low-level controller is essential for the advanced controller with an upper bound for floor surface temperature. In this regard, the effect of T f l o o r \u203e (from 26 °C to 28 °C with 0.5 °C intervals) on the frequency of low thermal comfort (PTC, calculated by Equation (1)) in the basement is studied. (1) Frequency ⋅ of ⋅ P T C ( % ) = ∑ k t k w k D × 100 where \u2018t\u2019 is the duration of poor thermal comfort (indoor air temperature lower than 21 °C or higher than 25 °C [45]), \u2018k\u2019 is the room number, \u2018w\u2019 is the volumetric weight ratio of the rooms and \u2018D\u2019 is the duration of the simulation. 4.2 Comparison between controllers To compare the performance of the advanced control strategies, seven cases (as shown in Table 4 ) are considered. Note that for all the cases mentioned in Table 4, the ground floor is heated by constant set-point control (21.5 °C), because the living room and kitchen are located on this floor, and smaller temperature fluctuation in these rooms are generally expected by occupant activities. In Table 4, the Reference case implements a constant set-point control strategy to both the basement and the second floor to simulate the commonly used heating strategy in practice. Case 1 studies the effect of RBC on the rooms heated by EBH or buried EHF, while Case 2 investigates the performance of implementing RBC in rooms heated through the buried EHF. Case 3 shifts the basement and the second floor's peak load by self-learning predictive control strategy and RBC, respectively. Compared with Case 3, Case 4 uses the manually controlled HES strategy to shift the second floor's peak load. Case 5 integrates the operation of buried EHF and HES by the advanced controller with an upper bound for floor surface temperature to shift the basement and the second floor's peak load, while Case 6 implements the advanced controller with HES operation. The peak shifting potential, thermal comfort maintenance, and heating cost-saving potential of Case 1\u20136 are compared to the Reference case. Note that the thermal comfort maintenance performance is estimated by the average indoor air temperature and thermal comfort potential (TCP, calculated by Equation (2)). (2) T C P = ∑ k ( D − t k ) w k D × 100 where \u2018t\u2019 is the duration of poor thermal comfort, \u2018k\u2019 is the number of rooms, \u2018w\u2019 is the volumetric weight ratio of the room and \u2018D\u2019 is the duration of the simulation. 5 Results and discussion In this section, the result of the selection of T f l o o r \u203e for the advanced controller with upper bound for floor surface temperature is presented in Section 5.1, while the result for comparison between controllers are shown in Section 5.2. Finally, a discussion would be given in Section 6. 5.1 Selection of upper bound floor surface temperature The effect of T f l o o r \u203e in the low-level controller of the advanced controller with upper bound for floor surface temperature on the frequency of PTC is shown in Fig. 12 . It indicates that 27 °C is the most suitable T f l o o r \u203e in terms maintaining thermal comfort. The reason for poor thermal comfort (PTC) when the upper bound is less than 27 °C is that the amount of energy stored during the off-peak period is insufficient to heat the rooms during peak periods. On the other hand, an upper bound higher than 27 °C could result in thermal discomfort due to an overshoot after the charging period. Therefore, T f l o o r \u203e with 27 °C is used for the advanced controller with upper bound for floor surface temperature in the case study for controller comparison. 5.2 Comparison between controllers The comparison results between the existing control strategies and the developed advanced controllers are presented in terms of peak shifting potential, thermal comfort, and cost-saving, respectively. 5.2.1 Peak shifting potential Fig. 13 compares the studied cases in terms of average power consumption during each period per day. It illustrates that peak shifting control strategies (i.e., Cases 1\u20136) can significantly decrease the power about 4 \u2013 4.5 kW during peak periods (i.e., morning and evening peak) compared to the Reference case because of energy storage during off-peak periods. Among these cases, Case 1 consumed more energy during the second off-peak period than the Reference case because the energy stored during the first off-peak period is insufficient to meet the heating demand during the daytime. To avoid creating a new peak period during the daytime, Cases 2- 6 store more energy during the first off-peak based on the predicted next day's energy consumption to cover the heating demand during the daytime. Furthermore, compared with self-learning predictive control (Case 4) and advanced controller with upper bound for floor surface temperature (Case 5), advanced controller with HES operation (Case 6) shifts more energy from peak periods to off-peak periods through storing more energy during the first off-peak period. This is because that during the off-peak period, turning ON the HES could decrease the indoor air temperature of the basement to be lower than T a i r \u203e , and thus, the EHF would not be turned OFF by the low-level controller. Fig. 14 presents the peak shifting potential of Case 1\u2013 6 compared with the Reference case for different floors. For the basement, all peak shifting control strategies shows significant peak shifting potential (higher than 97 %) through storing energy in buried EHF. For the second floor, Case 2 did not shift any peak load because no peak shifting control strategy has been applied. Case 1 and Case 3 shifted 45 % peak load through applying the RBC strategy to store energy by thermal mass during off-peak periods. Compared to rule-based control, Cases 4\u20136 show better peak shifting potential (more than 86 %). Among them, Case 6 shows a slightly higher peak shifting potential for both floors because operating HES during off-peak periods enables EHF to ease the interruption of charging and store enough energy during off-peak periods. Fig. 15 shows the energy shifting potential during the second off-peak period for Cases 1\u20136 compared to the Reference case. This figure shows that Case 1, which applied RBC consumed more energy (45.41 %) than the Reference case. Besides, Case 3, which utilized RBC on the second floor, shows less energy shifting potential than cases that utilized other peak shifting strategies. Case 2 has the second better performance in terms of load shifting potential during the second off-peak period, but it only focused on the basement. Case 6 shows the best energy shifting ability during the second off-peak period due to enough energy storage during the first off-peak period. Overall, the advanced controller with HES operation (Case 6) could be regarded as the best control strategy to achieve more load shifting for a more extended period (including peak periods and the second off-peak period) for this type of residential building construction. 5.2.2 Thermal comfort Fig. 16 shows the variation of volumetric weighted average temperature in the basement and second floor for different cases. Case 1, controlled by RBC, shows lesser temperature swing in the basement than Cases 2\u2013 6. However, it has a wider temperature range on the second floor. A similar result for the second floor presents in Case 3, which utilizes the same RBC strategy to heat the second floor. This indicates that RBC would not result in a great temperature fluctuation in the area with high thermal mass, while significant temperature swing would occur in the area without considerable thermal mass. On the other hand, compared with Case 5, Case 6 has a slightly higher indoor air temperature in the second floor due to warm air transferred from the basement to the second floor during the off peak-hours for preheating. To further analyze the effect of different control strategies on thermal comfort, TCP under different cases is shown in Fig. 17 . In all cases, the thermal comfort percentage is higher than 97.5 %. Thus, all peak shifting control strategies studied in this paper could maintain thermal comfort. Among them, RBC and advanced controller with HES operation are the top two options in terms of thermal comfort. 5.2.3 Heating cost-saving analysis Heating cost-saving based on CPP for different cases compared with the Reference case is shown in Fig. 18 . According to this figure, Case 2 that only applies peak shifting strategy to the basement, saves lesser cost than other cases. Besides, Cases 4\u2013 6 utilize HES for peak shifting achieves more cost-saving than Case 1 and Case 3. Therefore, HES can enhance the peak shifting capacity of a building with partially installed high thermal mass envelopes. Furthermore, Case 6 presents the highest cost saving due to the better peak shifting ability. 6 Discussion on advantages, limitations of the developed controllers and scope for future works It is obvious from the results that the proposed advanced controllers could effectively shift the peak load and achieve cost saving with maintaining the occupants\u2019 thermal comfort. This is because that the low-level controller would ensure that the advanced controllers work fine at the beginning stage of implementation through setting thresholds for indoor air temperature and floor surface. Besides, the proposed advanced controllers have a significant advantage that they could be directly implemented to a new place without requiring historical data or building characteristics to develop an accurate model. However, performance of the controllers could be further improved through optimal selection of parameters (e.g., T a i r \u203e , T a i r \u203e , T f l o o r \u203e , Tmin_learning, and Tmax_learning, etc.). At present, the advanced controllers lack flexibility in modifying the energy prediction model (high-level controller) based on user requirements. For instance, user may want to change T a i r and T a i r \u203e based on their thermal comfort preferences. However, once these parameters are modified, the learning process of high-level controller will start over. To avoid the repetitive learning process, improving the flexibility of these advanced controllers could be a valuable topic. Also, the advanced controllers predict the next day's energy demand based on the predicted weather category, thus, the identification and numbers of weather categories would also affect the control performance. Therefore, further work on studying the effect of modifying the advanced controllers' parameters would be an interesting topic. In terms of the HES, the influence of the fan characteristics (i.e., flowrate, power, and efficiency) over the peak shifting ability and heating cost savings shall be investigated. Furthermore, in this study, the aim of the advanced controllers is peak shifting. However, it could also be utilized to achieve optimal cost-saving or thermal comfort through a minor modification in the energy prediction model: it could select the E_Modified, which could meet the objective of minimal cost or maximal thermal comfort. 7 Conclusion In this study, two advanced controllers that integrates the self-learning predictive controller with the HES, were developed using TRNSYS - MATLAB model. The study's objective was to analyze the peak shifting ability of the developed controllers from the room (i.e., basement) with TES to rooms without a heat storage facility. In this regard, seven cases were considered to compare the performance of the proposed advanced controllers (in terms of peak shifting ability, heating cost savings and thermal comfort) with other peak shifting strategies (i.e., rule-based control and self-learning predictive control). Among the considered cases, the proposed advanced controllers showed better peak shifting potential and heating cost-saving for the whole building while guaranteeing thermal comfort. The developed advanced controllers shifted ~97 % peak load in the basement and up to 87 % peak load on the second floor. Besides, they saved 33 % heating cost based on the CPP tariff. The advanced controller with HES operation showed better results than the advanced controller with an upper bound for floor surface temperature in terms of peak shifting potential, thermal comfort, and cost-saving. Also, it could effectively avoid creating a new peak during the second off-peak period. The better performance of the advanced controller is caused by complete charging of the EHF during the first peak period. Furthermore, RBC which is easy-to-use with simple control strategy had the best performance in maintaining thermal comfort. However, as for peak shifting potential and heating cost saving, the advanced controllers showed superior performance than RBC. Advanced controller (SLC with EHF + HES) could provide the solution for completed charging in SLC to extend the peak shifting potential for the whole building (second floor up to 88 %) while the RBC can achieve the peak shifting around 45 % for the second floor. Meanwhile, advanced controller can avoid creating the new peak in the second off-peak period and could achieve higher cost saving 35.23 %. Overall, the developed advanced controllers showed better performance in terms of peak shifting, thermal comfort, and cost-saving, and the second off-peak shifting compared to the other control strategies considered in this study. Besides, the implementation of the developed controllers could be an effective method to decrease the stress of the electrical grid during peak periods.

        "dc:description": "To reduce the stress on the electrical grids during peak periods, pre-charging the building envelops with high thermal mass during off-peak periods and utilizing the stored energy during peak periods is an effective approach. However, most of the residential buildings in North America are generally built with lightweight materials, and the concrete slabs in the basement are the only option for energy storage. This means, heat storage is possible only in the basement, and achieving the peak shifting in the entire house is a challenge. To extend the peak shifting to the entire building, an automated heat extraction system (HES) that transfers the stored heat from the basement to the other parts of the house is desirable. Accordingly, this study developed two advanced controllers, which controls both electrically heated floor (EHF) (for energy storage in the basement) and HES (for transferring the stored heat to other parts of the house), to achieve peak shifting and heating cost-saving while guaranteeing the occupants\u2019 thermal comfort. The performance of the developed controllers was compared with other control strategies (i.e., constant set-point control, rule-based control and self-learning predictive control). The results showed that the developed advanced controllers effectively shift the energy consumption from the peak period (97 % for the basement and ~87 % for the second floor) and decrease the heating cost by ~33 %.",
