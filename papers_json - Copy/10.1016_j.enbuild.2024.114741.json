Buildings with occupant-centric control (OCC) systems can adjust heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) operations based on occupant status to minimize unnecessary energy use. However, because occupant behavior is stochastic rather than constant, and preferred setpoints can vary across occupant groups, this randomness significantly impacts energy use in buildings with OCC systems. This study used a stochastic simulation approach to model the uncertainty inherent in occupancy patterns and evaluate its impact on the energy consumption of an office building with OCC. In this case, the setpoint temperature was determined based on the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) method so that each zone could be controlled to the preferred temperature according to the occupant group. The results showed that the uncertainty of the annualized sum of electricity consumption for heating and cooling was 4.3 % and 1.8 %, respectively, with 95 % confidence intervals. Notably, a negative correlation was observed between the number of occupants and the uncertainty of energy consumption. Thus, as the uncertainty in the setpoint temperature increased during periods of low occupancy, the uncertainty in the energy consumption of the HVAC system also tended to increase. These insights underscore the significant influence of occupancy-related factors on building energy utilization. Data availability Data will be made available on request.

The indoor environment is influenced by outdoor weather conditions, affecting how occupants regulate building\u2019s active systems to maintain satisfactory heating, cooling, and lighting conditions [3]. It is important to recognize that these active systems are major contributors to a building\u2019s overall energy consumption [3,4]. Therefore, implementing appropriate control measures is imperative, and improper operation of these systems, without a strategic approach, can lead to excessive energy use [5,6]. For this reason, occupant-centric control (OCC) has been increasingly used in recent years to reduce unnecessary energy consumption in heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems [7]. The OCC system offers customized control services by utilizing real-time data on occupant behavior. Consequently, this system enables the precise adjustment of heating and cooling services to meet the occupants' needs at the appropriate times and locations, thereby enhancing indoor comfort and reducing energy consumption. In particular, lighting systems are already seeing increased use of OCC, and advances in information and communication technology, coupled with the decreasing cost of hardware, including wireless sensors, are lowering the barriers to entry for OCC systems [7\u20139]. Case studies demonstrate the significant potential of OCC systems to achieve energy savings [10\u201314]. In an experimental case, Stopps et al. [15] conducted an OCC-related study, in which occupancy-based smart thermostats were installed in multi-family residential buildings in Canada, and field data on HVAC run times were collected for their analysis. The results from the study by Stopps showed a significant reduction in HVAC run times by an average of 17 % compared to conventional thermostats. In addition, Peng et al. [16] developed an occupancy-based control algorithm using machine learning techniques and implemented it in an office building in Singapore to evaluate energy savings. Their results showed that the proposed algorithm reduced HVAC energy consumption by 7\u201352 %. Furthermore, researchers have demonstrated the long-term energy savings achievable through OCC in simulation-based studies [17\u201323]. Goyal et al. [20] developed a model predictive controller based on occupancy information and conducted a simulation study on energy savings. Their findings revealed that the implemented OCC system could achieve energy savings of up to 50 %. Similarly, Zhang et al. [22] undertook a simulation-based study on an office building in the context of US weather conditions to assess the energy savings potential of OCC systems. The results indicated that OCC controls could result in savings, ranging between 5 % and 19 % of the total energy consumption for various US climate zones. Occupancy-based control systems also have significant potential for improving indoor comfort. Researchers have also shown that the use of metabolic rates adjusted for occupants' physical characteristics can improve the accuracy of thermal comfort predictions [24,25]. Recently, with the development of video-based observation devices and state estimation algorithms, the observation accuracy of occupant information has been increasingly improved, and thermal comfort-based control techniques that consider the occupants' personal comfort have been proposed [26\u201328]. The Predictive Mean Vote (PMV) model is the representative thermal comfort prediction model and has been used by many researchers for comfort-based control. Wu et al. [29] applied the PMV control method to a space significantly influenced by solar radiation. Through simulation using a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model, the PMV control method demonstrated an enhancement in thermal comfort compared to the existing air temperature control method, resulting in a 1.6 % increase in thermal comfort. Kang et al. [30] investigated the energy-saving potential of PMV control, revealing that PMV control outperformed the existing air temperature-based control method, except under very high radiant temperature conditions. Their findings highlighted the dual benefits of improved thermal comfort and energy savings. The proposed method was confirmed to enhance comfort and reduce energy consumption by approximately 17 % compared to the existing air temperature-based on/off control method. Similarly, Xie et al. [31] explored thermal comfort-based control cases, including PMV. Their results indicated a median energy-saving effect of 22 % and a comfort improvement of 29.1 % in thermal comfort control cases compared to the conventional scheduled operation. The presented research demonstrates that buildings incorporating OCC can potentially reduce unnecessary energy consumption by accounting for occupant behavior and characteristics and aligning HVAC system operation with occupant preferences. This approach yields several positive outcomes, including energy savings for the building and enhanced occupant comfort. However, since OCC systems control the building's systems based on the occupant's state, the building's energy consumption is highly dependent on the occupant's behavior [32]. In particular, since occupant behavior is stochastic and uncertain, the energy usage of OCC systems can also be subject to large uncertainties. Related research has shown that the uncertainty in occupant behavior is influenced by a variety of sources, including external factors such as the occupants themselves, their personal preferences, building properties, etc. In a study of Danish homes, occupant-controlled behavior such as window opening and heating use were investigated. The results showed a strong correlation between external weather conditions and occupant behavior, and this correlation was also found to be affected by the gender and age of the occupants [33]. Psychological factors also contribute to influencing occupant behavior. Zhang and Barrett [34] studied factors influencing blind behavior in naturally ventilated buildings and reported that the desire to maintain a connection between the indoors and outdoors encourages occupants to open blinds. On the other hand, Foster and Oreszczyn [35] noted that occupants of offices facing other buildings frequently closed blinds for privacy. Therefore, if the energy consumption of a building is calculated without considering these uncertainties, the predicted building energy value may differ greatly from the actual value. Previous studies have identified factors related to occupant behaviour as a major source of uncertainty in building energy prediction. Additional research [22] has indicated that energy consumption in office buildings can exhibit variations exceeding 40 %, depending on occupancy patterns. Liang et al. [36] developed an occupancy schedule model based on measured occupancy data, conducting building energy simulations that compare results obtained using a deterministic schedule. The findings revealed a tendency of the predetermined schedule to overestimate HVAC consumption by approximately 21 %. Other case studies have demonstrated significant variability in building energy consumption based on occupants' perceptions of energy conservation [37]. In addition, the variability in thermal comfort based on individual physical characteristics is a major source of uncertainty that cannot be ignored. In multi-occupied spaces, such as office buildings, the required indoor thermal environment may vary depending on the preferences of the occupant group. Al-Mumin et al. [38] investigated the use of air conditioning in residential buildings during the summer and reported that thermostat setpoints can vary from 19 °C to 25 °C. Previous studies have shown that there is a correlation between occupants' physical characteristics (weight and body mass index) and their comfort temperature range [39]. Occupant behavior and conditions are challenging to predict and inherently stochastic. These uncertainties can impact the system load and operating hours, resulting in unexpected deviations between the designer's expectations and the actual system load. These deviations should also be considered important for practical reasons. Overdesign of HVAC systems contribute to higher initial investment and operating costs [40]. Furthermore, an underdesigned HVAC system may not provide adequate cooling or heating to an indoor space, potentially reducing thermal comfort and causing discomfort to occupants. Therefore, the capacity of the OCC system should be calculated at the design stage to account for uncertainties in order to make cost-effective decisions [41]. For this reason, researchers have quantified the uncertainty in building energy by stochastically considering parameters that have a significant impact on energy consumption. Silva et al. [42] analyzed the uncertainty in building simulation for residential buildings by stochastically inputting the energy consumption behavior of the occupants and the thermal parameters of the envelope. The results showed that the 95 % confidence interval of the energy consumption ranged from 6.6 % to 21.5 % and that the main sources of uncertainty were the occupant behavior and the solar absorption coefficient of the building envelope. Yoon et al. [43] developed an occupant behavior algorithm using Markov chain and Monte Carlo methods to analyze the uncertainty in occupant ventilation behavior. Azar et al. [44] also conducted an uncertainty analysis study of occupant behavior parameters in educational buildings. They identified the energy consumption of plug and lighting systems during unoccupied hours as the main sources of uncertainty. Zheng and Fuxin conducted a building energy uncertainty study for residential buildings, focusing on system operation schedules [45]. They used the Kahunen-Lobe expansion-based sampling method to impose uncertainty on HVAC schedule inputs, such as occupancy rate and setpoint temperature. They performed Monte Carlo simulations and sensitivity analyses. They reported that the uncertainty in HVAC energy consumption is about 4 % and that the uncertainty in the setpoint schedule greatly impacts the energy use patterns. Previous studies have quantified building energy uncertainty in the form of probability distributions of occupancy. However, most of these studies have been conducted with a wide range of parameters that affect building energy use, such as thermal properties of the envelope and climatic conditions, rather than focusing on occupant behavior. They also make simplistic assumptions about occupant behavior scenarios and do not take into account the diversity in thermal comfort of occupant groups. As occupant behavior patterns, such as arrival and departure from work, are variable over time, the uncertainty in energy consumption can also change over time. Due to the low cost and sophistication of monitoring systems, OCC systems are being developed to control HVAC systems based on occupant information. Therefore, in order to quantify the uncertainty of energy consumption in buildings with OCC systems, it is necessary to consider the behavior patterns of occupants over time and the thermal comfort preferences of different groups of occupants. In this study, we defined an OCC system that provides lighting, heating, cooling, etc. based on the occupant's occupancy status and physical information and performed an uncertainty analysis of the OCC system energy consumption, focusing on the variability of occupancy status. For this purpose, a probability model considering the occupants' daily routine was established to generate the occupancy schedule and a procedure to control it with a setpoint temperature considering the PMV of the occupant group was introduced in the study. 2 Methodology overview In this paper, uncertainty in energy use in an office building with an OCC system is investigated by utilizing Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) techniques to derive distributions for building energy use. MCS is a widely used technique for estimating the impact of uncertain parameters by repeatedly inputting randomly sampled variables to derive the resulting distribution [45,46]. Fig. 1 illustrates the process of using Monte Carlo simulations to derive uncertainty in the energy use of a building with OCC. First, a number of occupants are generated equal to the building's occupancy capacity. Each occupant is characterized by their gender, height, and other physical characteristics based on a pre-established probability distribution. Subsequently, simulation input schedules are generated based on the generated occupant information. Since the system operation schedule of a building with OCC is determined by occupant behavior, the occupancy schedule needs to be generated first. Once this occupancy schedule is determined, the rest of the setpoint temperature, lighting operation, and internal load schedules are established. The set of inputs is generated using a stochastic model to incorporate uncertainty. Once the inputs are generated, they are directly fed into the building energy analysis program for whole-building energy simulation. By repeating the process enough times and aggregating all the simulation results, the uncertainty in the energy use of a building with OCC is quantified. In subsequent sections, the article is structured as follows: Section 3 details the development of stochastic models used to generate internal load schedules for simulation purposes. Section 4 further explains the building energy simulation process, including an EnergyPlus-based co-simulation process in Python, along with a comprehensive description of the building\u2019s geometry and the applied HVAC system. Section 5 discusses the results of the uncertainty analysis. Finally, Section 6 presents the conclusions drawn from this study. 3 Stochastic models for internal schedule generation This section outlines the methodology for generating schedule inputs for occupancy uncertainty. This study produces simulation inputs using a probabilistic model to capture the uncertainty associated with occupancy in the simulation results. The inputs to be generated are particularly relevant to OCC and include four schedules: the occupancy schedule, setpoint schedule, plug load schedule, and lighting schedule. 3.1 Occupancy schedule based on Markov-chain The occupancy of office workers can be determined by events, such as arrivals, departures, etc. Since these events do not always occur simultaneously, the occupancy schedule needs to be generated with a probabilistic approach. In this study, a Markov-chain model is used to generate the occupancy schedule so that the occupancy status of the occupants is determined probabilistically. The Markov-chain model is a model that follows a Markov process in which the probability of the next point-in-time state is determined by the current state regardless of the past state, as shown in Eq. (1). Markov-chain models have been used to model occupancy schedules in various cases and have been validated several times based on actual occupancy density measurements [47,48]. Eq. (2) shows how a Markov chain can be used to determine the probability of a state at a point in time. The probability of an occupant's next state is independent of past states and can be determined by multiplying the probability of the current state by the corresponding transition probability matrix, presented in Eq. (3). (1) p s t + 1 s t ) = p ( s t + 1 | s t , s t - 1 , ⋯ , s t - n ) (2) p ( s t ) = p ( s 1 ) ∏ n = 1 t - 1 P n (3) P t = T Home → H o m e ( t ) ⋯ T Home → R e s t ( t ) ⋮ ⋱ ⋮ T Rset → H o m e ( t ) ⋯ T Rest → R e s t ( t ) where s t is the state of the time step t and T i → j ( t ) is the Transition probability from state i to state j on state of the time step t , P ( t ) is the Markov transition probability matrix. Since the probability of a state transition for an office worker is time-varying, let P (t) is modeled as a non-homogeneous form. The left side of Fig. 2 shows a typical worker's day, and the right side shows a state transition diagram of that worker's day. First, the worker arrives at the workplace and begins the morning shift. At the end of the morning shift, at the end of the afternoon shift, the worker becomes unoccupied through the Leave event. During the morning or afternoon shift, workers can periodically take short breaks. Using relevant statistics and occupancy data from previous studies of office buildings, we constructed the following scheduling scenario [49,50]: (i) At the beginning of the day, the occupant enters the office from home by going to work during the morning hours (8:00\u20139:30). (ii) After working for the morning, the occupant leaves the workplace for lunch at approximately 11:30\u201312:30. (iii) After a 1\u20132-hour lunch break, the occupant enters the workplace for the afternoon working. (iv) After performing the afternoon working, the occupant leaves the building. Leaving the workplace is assumed to take place over a wide time frame (17:30 to 22:00), as office workers sometimes stay late to complete their assigned tasks. (v) Occupants at work may take intermittent short breaks of about 10 to 30 min approximately every two hours. Based on this scenario, the study classified the states of the occupants into four states. The right side of Fig. 2 shows the state transition diagrams for the four classified states. The initial state for all residents is \u201chome\u201d ( s 1 = H o m e ) , and the occupant's state is determined by their transition probabilities to one of the four states at discrete time steps of 10 min (t = 1,2, \u2026, 144), seen in Eq. (4). (4) s t ∈ { H o m e , W o r k , L u n c h , R e s t } Home : The occupant is not at work, such as before going to work or after leaving work. Work : The resident is working in the office, which is the occupied state. Lunch : An unoccupied state that indicates the occupant is outside the building for lunch. Rest : An unoccupied state of less than one hour. Short breaks, such as coffee breaks, qualify for this status. To simulate the occupancy state of office workers, the transition probabilities must vary with time. For example, the transition probability from the state \u201chome\u201d to the state \u201cwork\u201d should be higher in the morning than in the afternoon. Therefore, the transition probabilities were modeled with two types of probability distributions, depending on whether the probability changes over time. The probability of a state transition for an event occurring at a specific time of day, such as arriving at work or leaving work, was determined to follow a Weibull cumulative distribution function. Eq. (5) shows the form of the Weibull cumulative distribution function. We set the probability distribution so that the probability of occurrence varies with time by adjusting the three parameters u, l, and k of the Weibull function. Events that may occur randomly at work time, such as taking a short break, are modeled as an exponential distribution since the decision depends on the duration of the current state, not on the specific time of day. Eq. (6) shows the form of the exponential cumulative distribution function. By adjusting the parameter λ of that function, we made the periodicity of short breaks during the workday probabilistic. The probability function and its corresponding parameters for each state transition are shown in Table 1 . In addition, workers' schedules vary according to the day of the week. In general, Monday to Friday are the times when workers perform their normal routines, while Saturday and Sunday are less frequent. To reflect this occasion, the probability of an employee coming to work on weekends and holidays has been set to: Saturday: 0.20, Sunday Holidays: 0.05. (5) P ( t ) = 1 - e - t - u l k 0 t ≥ t T t < t T (6) P ( t ) = 1 - e - λ t where l , k is a parameter of the Weibull cumulative distribution function, and t T is the start time at which the event is likely to occur. λ is a parameter of the exponential distribution. The transition probabilities are determined to follow the probability distribution after modeling the events for state transitions using the cumulative probability distribution. In the generated occupant schedule, only the \u201c Work \u201d states in the generated occupancy schedule are considered to occupy the zone, and the zone's occupancy density schedule SCH O is determined as the average of the occupancy schedules sch o by the number of people, as seen in Eqs. (7) and (8). (7) sch o ( t ) = 1 0 s t = W o r k e l s e (8) SCH O ( t ) = ∑ i = 1 N sch o ( t ) N After determining the cumulative probability distributions of the major state transition events, the transition probabilities were derived using the procedure introduced by Page et al. [47] The method uses a predetermined cumulative probability distribution and a mobility parameter μ to derive transition probabilities according to Eqs. (9)\u2013(11). (9) μ ( t ) = T i → j t + T j → i ( t ) T i → i t + T j → j ( t ) (10) T i → j t = μ - 1 μ + 1 P t + P ( t + 1 ) (11) T j → j t = P t - 1 P ( t ) μ - 1 μ + 1 P t + P t + 1 + P ( t + 1 ) P ( t ) The established model was run iteratively to generate an occupancy density schedule dataset. Fig. 3 shows the resulting occupancy schedule. The average of the generated occupancy densities shows that the occupancy status starts to shift to occupied at around 8:00, when the clock-in event occurs, and converges to around 0.7 when the clock-in event ends at around 9:30. Throughout the morning, the average occupancy remains around 0.7 and then starts to drop again at the start of lunch (11:30), dropping to 0.2 at 12:30. After lunch, this study can see that the occupancy density quickly increases again as the occupants begin to return to work and gradually decreases as they begin to leave. During the morning and afternoon shifts, the occupancy density fluctuates between 0.8 and 0.6 with a CI of 95 % due to the intermittent breaks. Although the average value of the generated schedule is similar to that of the deterministic method, when zooming in to the sample level, the individual schedule samples differ from the deterministic schedule, as shown in Fig. 3. 3.2 Setpoint temperature schedule based on occupant This section describes how to determine the setpoint temperature schedule for each zone, considering the occupant characteristics and occupancy status. The following procedure determined the setpoint schedule. First, the study calculates the setpoint that satisfies the thermal comfort range of each occupant based on their physical characteristics. Then, based on the calculated personal setpoint temperatures and occupancy schedules, the zone setpoint schedule is determined as shown in Eq. (12). That is, the zone setpoint temperature was determined by averaging the personal setpoints of the occupants in the occupied state and rounding to two decimal places. The setpoint is assigned as a setback temperature if there are no occupants. T setback is set to 15.5℃ for the heating period and 29℃ for the cooling period. (12) SCH set ( t ) = ∑ i = 1 C o t ( T set i | s t = W o r k ) C o t T setback C o t > 0 C o t = 0 Where, C o is the number of occupants in the work state ( s t = W o r k ) and T set i is the setpoint temperature of the individual i 's set temperature and T setback is the setback temperature. 3.2.1 Setpoint temperature model based on PMV In this study, the predicted mean vote (PMV) of the occupants was used to determine the setpoint temperature that satisfies the comfort range of the occupants. PMV is a widely used metric for quantitatively representing thermal comfort in the building field, and it is introduced as an indicator of thermal comfort in ISO 7730 [51] and ASHRAE 55 [52]. The PMV index expresses thermal comfort as a range between −3 and 3. If the calculated value is close to 3, it will indicate that the occupant feels hotter. Conversely, the value is close to −3, the occupant feels colder. PMV is calculated from six variables, including four physical variables and two personal values, as shown in Eq. (13). Here, the four variables (air temperature, average radiant temperature, wind speed, and air humidity) are physical variables of the environment in which the occupant is located. The clothing value and metabolic rate, on the other hand, are variables that represent the occupant's condition rather than the physical environment. The clothing value is determined by the clothing the occupant is wearing, and the metabolic rate is calculated based on the occupant's activity level and physical characteristics. PMV = f PMV T air , T mrt , R H , v , m e t , c l o where T air is the room temperature, RH is the relative humidity, v is the air velocity, T mrt is the mean radiant temperature, clo is the clothing value, and met is the metabolic rate. Therefore, by utilizing the PMV model, it is possible to output environmental variables that satisfy the PMV of the condition of interest. In this study, the air temperature that satisfies the comfort range PMV for the metabolic rate (met) determined by the physical characteristics of the occupants was utilized as the set temperature. To accomplish this, a model was established that takes the occupants' metabolic rate and clothing index as input variables and calculates the air temperature that satisfies the PMV comfort zone under those conditions. The setpoint temperature model was modeled in a fourth-order polynomial form using the occupant's metabolic rate met and clothing value clo as shown in Eq. (14) below. The weights ω i , j of the model were then determined by fitting the dataset generated from ISO 7730 model. The dataset for model fitting consisted only of data with an absolute value of PMV less than 0.01 to satisfy the comfort range, and several assumptions and constraints were applied. Table 2 shows the constraints of PMV input parameters for data set generation. (i) The data for model fitting consists of data that satisfies PMV ± 0.01 to output air temperature in the comfort range. (ii) The mean radiant temperature is assumed to be the same as the air temperature, and the relative humidity and wind speed are considered as fixed values. (iii) Based on the statistical data on office workers, the metabolic rate and clothing index of the occupants are constrained to a certain range of values. (14) T set = ∑ i = 0 4 ∑ j = 0 4 ω i , j clo i m e t j ( i f i + j > 4 , ω i , j = 0 ) Fig. 4 below shows the setpoint model's fitting results and the original data's absolute error. On the left side of Fig. 4, the surface plot shows the air temperature satisfying 'PMV = 0\u2019 calculated from the PMV model, and the scatter plot shows the air temperature calculated from the setpoint model. The figure shows that the setpoint model can output air temperatures that satisfy 'PMV=0\u2032 at the given 'clo' and 'met'. The right side of Fig. 4 shows the absolute error of the setpoint temperature model from random input. The absolute error shows good accuracy with an average of 0.020 °C and a maximum of 0.056 °C. 3.2.2 Metabolic rate estimation In this study, the metabolic rate of each occupant is determined by considering their four physical characteristics (gender, age, height, and weight). To do this, the study refers to the method presented in the standard ISO 8996 [53], \u201cEvaluation of the metabolic rate at level 3\u201d. The method of level 3 of the standard is the estimation of the metabolic rate from recordings of heart rate. The calculation method is shown in Eq. (15), which determines the metabolic rate by considering the effects of the occupant's heart rate (HR), gender, age, and body composition (weight, body fat). Eq. (15) was derived from the linear correlation between heart rate and metabolic rate at heart rates below 120 bpm. Since most sedentary office workers do not exceed a heart rate of 120 bpm, this relationship is reasonably applicable to this study. (15) met = MWC - m e t 0 H R max - H R 0 H R m - H R 0 + met 0 where MWC is the maximal work capacity, in watts per kg of body weight or in watts, Met 0 is the resting metabolic rate, in watts per kg or in watts, HR max is the maximum heart rate, in beats per minute (bpm). HR 0 is the heart rate at the rest, in bpm, HR m is the average heart rate, in bpm, M is the corresponding metabolic rate, in watts per kg or in watts. Since the physical characteristics of the occupants in the office may vary among individuals, it is necessary to consider the physical characteristics of the occupants probabilistically. Therefore, the physical characteristics of the workers are sampled by establishing a probability distribution. Table 3 and Fig. 5 show the distributions of the physical characteristics of the occupants. The distribution of the occupants\u2019 physical characteristics was determined based on \u2018health examination statistics\u2019 from the Korean Statistical Information Service [54]. 3.3 Internal load schedule 3.3.1 Internal lighting load Lighting loads account for a large portion of energy use in office buildings. In addition, HVAC system energy consumption can vary with lighting energy use because the energy used for lighting is converted to heat according to the second law of thermodynamics, which affects the room heating and cooling load. Since adequate lighting is essential in an office work environment, the lighting system needs to be activated if there is a single occupant. Based on this fact, in this study, the lighting operation rate schedule SC H L is modeled according to the presence of occupants as shown in Eq. (16) below. This schedule model has a simple form of on/off depending on the presence of occupants. Therefore, the lighting schedule inputs were implemented using the Energy Management System (EMS), a control programming module provided by the simulation program [55]. (16) SC H L ( t ) = 1 0.02 SC H O ( t ) > 0 e l s e 3.3.2 Internal plug load Plug loads are the loads due to office device energy use related to computers, photocopiers, telephones, etc., accounting for a large percentage of office building energy consumption [56,57]. Since occupants control a large portion of office devices, the plug load is highly correlated with the occupancy status of the occupants. Considering these factors, the plug schedule was generated as shown in Eq. (17), using the probabilistic prediction method proposed by Mahdavi et al. [58]. This model probabilistically generates the plug load rate according to the occupancy status based on the Weibull distribution. Table 4 shows the parameters of the plug load model. (17) f ( t , s ) = b s a s t a s b - 1 e - t a s b s (18) SC H plug ( t ) = ∑ i = 1 N f ( t , s t , i ) N 4 Building energy simulation 4.1 Simulation process To conduct the uncertainty analysis of whole building energy consumption related to occupants, the simulation was executed through the following steps, as illustrated in Fig. 6 . Firstly, schedules relevant to occupants (occupancy, lighting, and heating and cooling setpoints schedules) were generated based on the probabilistic model. Subsequently, the generated schedules were input into the simulation model to perform an energy consumption simulation, employing EnergyPlus 9.0 [59] as the simulation tool. EnergyPlus is a widely used whole-building simulation program capable of modeling various physical phenomena related to energy consumption, heating, cooling, lighting, ventilation, and building performance. Its flexibility in accepting different schedule formats makes it suitable for schedule input-based uncertainty simulation. Finally, the building model was simulated with the schedule input, and the results were saved. The sequence of steps was repeated 2000 times to generate a distribution of outcomes that incorporates the uncertainty of the inputs. The number of simulation iterations was determined by referring to related cases [45,60]. This process was implemented in Python to facilitate the modification and iterative generation of numerous EnergyPlus files. 4.2 Building description For the case study, the medium-sized office building model, provided by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) with ASHRAE 90.1 Standards, was utilized [61]. Fig. 7 illustrates the exterior and internal floor plan of the medium office model. This model is a three-floor office building (height: 11.7 m) with a total floor area of 4,982 m2. Each floor is divided into five thermal zones, comprising four peripheral zones and one core zone, and the window area ratio for the entire building is 33 %. Architectural details and unmentioned internal heat gains were input based on the specifications outlined in ASHRAE Standard 90.1\u20132019. Table 5 below provides details regarding the building envelope of the office building model, including thermal characteristics. The HVAC system of the model is a roof-top unit-based variable air volume (RTU-VAV) system. Fig. 8 shows a schematic of the HVAC system applied to the building model. The system maintains the temperature of the conditioned space by controlling the amount of supply air from the air handling unit (AHU) to the conditioned space. The amount of supply air is controlled using a fan in the AHU and a fan in each terminal unit, and the temperature of the supply air is set to a constant value (Heating: 40 °C, Cooling: 12.8 °C) depending on the heating and cooling modes. The AHU installed on each floor of the building consists of an electric cooling coil, an electric heating coil, and a supply fan and provides heating and cooling air to the five conditioned spaces located on that floor. For the detailed performance curve of this system, the default performance curve of the VAV model provided by EnergyPlus was used, and the rated coefficient of performance (COP) values were set to 3.23 and 1.0 for the cooling coil and the efficiency of the heating coil, respectively. The total heating and cooling capacity of each coil was determined by autosizing to control the indoor temperature to the 97.5 % percentile of the setpoint temperature distribution under design day conditions. 5 Uncertainties analysis 5.1 Setpoint temperature schedule A PMV-optimized setpoint temperature schedule dataset was generated based on the established setpoint temperature generation model. The occupants' clothing values were randomly sampled from a distribution based on data from a related study [62]. Fig. 9 shows the distribution of the generated setpoint temperature schedules for a room with 20 occupants. During scheduled working hours, the uncertainty of the schedule tends to be constant without much change, but it tends to increase around events such as lunch or leaving work. The 95 % confidence interval (CI) for the setpoint temperature schedule during the scheduled working hours is 22.6 ± 0.5 °C for heating and 25.7 ± 0.4 °C for cooling. In this study, the zone setpoint temperatures at a given time were determined as the average comfort temperatures of the workers occupying the space at that time. This means that the zoned setpoint temperature is considered a sample average of individual PMV-based comfort temperatures, so the uncertainty of the setpoint temperature depends on the number of samples, based on the 'law of large numbers'. The more occupants (sample) in the occupied state, the more likely the zone setpoint temperature is to be close to the average setpoint temperature for all occupants, and conversely, the fewer occupants in the occupied state, the less likely the zone setpoint temperature is to be close to the average setpoint temperature for all occupants. Therefore, the uncertainty of the zone setpoint temperatures depends on the number of occupants, suggesting that the uncertainty of the setpoint may vary depending on the area of the zone and the occupancy schedule. The left side of Fig. 10 depicts a graph of the zone setpoint temperatures as a function of occupancy based on randomly generated occupancy information. The standard deviation of the zone setpoint temperature is 0.9 °C for a room with 5 occupants and 0.3 °C for a room with 40 occupants, demonstrating a gradual decrease as the number of occupants increases. Fig. 10 is a histogram of PMV-based setpoint temperatures. The graph on the left shows the personal setpoint temperatures and the graph on the right shows the zone setpoint temperatures. Since the zone setpoint temperature is a sample average of the personal setpoint temperature, the mean value is the same, but the uncertainty is reduced by about 50 %. For the heating setpoint temperature, the personal setpoint temperature and the zone setpoint temperature are 22.6 °C±1.5 °C and 22.6 °C±0.8 °C, respectively, with 95 % confidence, and for the cooling setpoint temperature, the personal setpoint temperature and the zone setpoint temperature are 26.7 °C±1.0 °C and 26.7 °C±0.5 °C, respectively, with 95 % confidence. The right side of Fig. 11 shows a sample zone setpoint temperature schedule for a zone with a maximum occupancy of 20 people. This figure shows how the zone setpoint temperature is determined by changes in occupancy density. The red dots represent the individual setpoint temperatures of the occupants, while the black solid line denotes the zone setpoint temperature, which is the average of the individual setpoint temperatures. Since the zone setpoint temperature is considered a mean of the individual setpoints, the value tends to be relatively constant with little variation during high occupancy periods but less constant and more variables during low occupancy periods, such as lunchtime and leaving work. This figure shows an example of how a small number of occupants can cause a large variation in setpoint temperature during certain hours. During lunch and overtime hours (19:00\u201321:00), the occupancy density is low with 5 or fewer occupants. Since the zone setpoint is determined by the average setpoint of the occupants, the low number of occupants (sample size) shows that the zone setpoint can be influenced by individuals, resulting in large variations. In this example, during the overtime period (20:00\u201321:00), the zone setpoint temperature tends to increase because most of the workers who feel comfortable (−0.01 < PMV < 0.01) at high setpoint temperatures are occupied. 5.2 Time series uncertainties of HVAC energy consumption This section presents an analysis of the time series uncertainty in HVAC systems based on occupant-centric control. The analysis quantitatively evaluates the time series uncertainty of HVAC energy use, considering the propagation of occupancy uncertainty. This can be achieved by aggregating the results of Monte Carlo simulations for representative cooling and heating days. The analysis focuses on the simulation results of the mid-floor (2nd floor), selecting the representative day (Summer: August 3rd, Winter: January 23rd) with the highest load during the entire cooling and heating period. Figs. 12 and 13 below illustrate the time series uncertainty of indoor temperature and HVAC load in the mid-floor zone. In Figs. 12 and 13, the top-left graph presents the occupancy, while the top-right graph displays the indoor temperature of the zone. Zone indoor temperatures were collected from perimeter zone 1, which faces the south exterior surface, and the core zone, which does not face the outside. The bottom-left and right graphs depict cooling and heating energy usage and outside weather conditions, respectively. Fig. 12 shows the time series uncertainty for a representative day in the summer. We can see that the uncertainty in the indoor temperature and cooling energy consumption of the zone depends on the number of occupants during the system's operating period. At around 16:00, which is a high occupancy period, the 95 % confidence interval (CI) of the indoor temperature in zone 1 is 25.71 ± 0.45 °C. However, at lunchtime and after work, which are low-occupancy periods, the CI 95 % of the room temperature was 25.67 ± 0.72 °C and 25.58 ± 0.82 °C, respectively, indicating a relatively large uncertainty. Regarding the cooling energy consumption, the CI 95 % is 25.05 ± 1.04 kJ/m2 during high occupancy hours (around 16:00). However, the uncertainty tends to increase during low occupancy hours. The CI 95 % of the cooling energy consumption during lunchtime (around 12:30) and after work (around 19:00) is 20.70 ± 2.39 kJ/m2 and 21.21 ± 2.39 kJ/m2, respectively. The uncertainty of cooling energy at night is quite large, especially since there are fewer workers at night, which leads to large fluctuations in setpoint temperature. Fig. 13 shows the time series uncertainty for a representative winter day. During the high occupancy period (around 11:00), the 95 % CI of the indoor temperature in zone 1 was 22.62 ± 0.57 °C, while during the low occupancy period (around 19:00), the 95 % CI of the indoor temperature was 22.02 ± 1.42 °C, showing a relatively high uncertainty. The uncertainty of indoor temperature due to weather conditions, such as insolation, varied by zone. In the south-facing perimeter zone 1, indoor temperature rises above the heating setpoint during periods of high insolation (14:00\u201316:00). Consequently, the heating system stops during that period and operates independently of the setpoint temperature. In contrast, in the core zone, with minimal solar gain, the indoor temperature is determined by the setpoint throughout the day. It does not exhibit noticeable changes due to external weather conditions. Similarly, heating energy use shows a deviation from the mean value with a 95 % CI of about 10.01 ± 0.74 kJ/m2 during the high occupancy period (around 16:00). There is a trend of increasing uncertainty 11.33 ± 3.25 kJ/m2 as occupancy decreases during evening hours (around 19:00). The uncertainty of the heating and cooling energy consumption was analyzed based on the main routines of office workers. Fig. 14 shows the standard deviation of the heating and cooling energy consumption for three time periods (work, lunch and overtime). These standard deviations were calculated using weekday data for the heating season (January) and cooling season (August). The standard deviation of the working hours (9:00\u201311:30, 13:00\u201318:00) is the lowest of the three time periods, at 0.68 kJ/m2 and 0.49 kJ/m2 for the cooling and heating periods, respectively. The uncertainty is relatively small during these periods due to the large number of occupants and small fluctuations in occupancy rates. The standard deviation for the lunch period (11:30\u201313:00) shows higher uncertainty than the working hours, with 0.91 kJ/m2 and 0.77 kJ/m2 for the cooling and heating periods, respectively. In these periods, the uncertainty tends to increase as the variation in occupancy rate increases. The standard deviation for the overtime period (18:00\u201322:00) was 0.81 kJ/m2 and 1.06 kJ/m2 for the cooling and heating periods, respectively. During these periods, occupancy fluctuations were high due to workers leaving the office, which tends to increase the uncertainty of energy consumption. In the case of the heating season, as the outside temperature decreases at night, the heating load increases, and the variation of energy consumption increases significantly. 5.3 Uncertainties in annual energy consumption This section presents an analysis of the distribution of annual energy usage by energy type under occupancy-based control. Following the completion of the Monte Carlo-based building energy simulation, the cumulative annual energy usage distribution was calculated for five types (heating coil, cooling coil, supply fan, lighting, and plug). Heating coil energy consumption includes the electricity consumption of the AHU's heating coil and the reheat coil of the terminal unit. Results indicate that heating coil electricity consumption is, on average, 82 % higher than cooling coil electricity consumption despite the office building having high cooling usage. This disparity is attributed to the high coefficient of performance of the cooling coil, allowing it to handle approximately three times more load than the heating coil with the same electrical energy inputs. Fig. 15 illustrates the cumulative distribution of annual energy use per unit area for the mid-floor (second floor), while Table 6 shows the mean, standard deviation, 2.5 % percentile, and 97.5 % percentile values for each energy consumption source. The mean for the total annual electricity consumption of cooling coils is 9.11 kWh/m2, with a 95 % CI of 8.95 kWh/m2 \u2013 9.28 kWh/m2, showing a variation of about 1.8 % from the mean value. The mean for the total annual electricity consumption of heating coils is 16.59 kWh/m2, with a 95 % confidence range of 15.91 kWh/m2 \u2013 17.33 kWh/m2. The average annual consumption of lighting energy is 12.20 kWh/m2, with a 95 % CI of 12.11 kWh/m2 \u2013 12.28 kWh/m2, showing a variation of about 4.3 % from the mean value. The confidence interval variation for lighting energy is 1 %, indicating a relatively low level of uncertainty. This is attributed to the lighting system's operation being solely determined by the presence of occupants, and the target indoor luminance level is considered independent of occupant characteristics. The results indicate that heating coil electricity consumption exhibits higher uncertainty compared to cooling coil electricity consumption. This heightened uncertainty is attributed to the individual installation of reheat coils in each zone. Fig. 16 illustrates the distribution of annual electricity use by the heating coils in the AHU and the reheat coils in each zone. The left side of Fig. 15 displays the aggregated energy consumption of the heating coils throughout the Monte Carlo simulation. The uncertainty in the electricity use of the AHU heating coils is less than 1 %, indicating minimal variation. However, the energy consumption of the reheat coils shows relatively high variation. The Fig. 16 illustrates the distribution of reheat coil energy usage by zone, revealing variations in both energy consumption and uncertainty across zones. Particularly, the energy consumption of the reheat coil in perimeter zone 4 fluctuates by ± 33 % with a 95 % confidence interval. In this scenario, the uncertainty in the reheat coil significantly influences heating energy uncertainty, as the electricity use of the reheat coil constitutes approximately 34 % of the total heating energy consumption. Fig. 17 shows the mean and standard deviation of each type of energy consumption by month. The uncertainty in cooling coil and heating coil energy use varies seasonally, in proportion to the average consumption. The monthly standard deviation for cooling coils reaches up to 0.022 kWh/m2 in July, while the monthly standard deviation for heating coils reaches up to 0.089 kWh/m2 in January. Conversely, the uncertainty of plug and lighting loads does not exhibit any seasonal variation, with monthly standard deviations converging at 3.8 Wh/m2 and 8.3 Wh/m2, respectively. 5.4 Uncertainties in annual peak load Based on the simulation results, the peak loads of the HVAC system were aggregated. The relative level of uncertainty in the peak load of the heating and cooling coils was similar to the uncertainty in the cumulative annual energy use. Fig. 18 illustrates the peak loads of the heating coil, cooling coil, and supply fan, and Table 7 shows statistics on the uncertainty of peak load. The results indicate that the 95 % confidence interval for the heating coil is 27.80 Wh/m2 \u2013 30.57 Wh/m2 (Mean ± 4.9 %), and for the cooling coil, the 95 % confidence interval of the peak loads is 11.27 Wh/m2 \u2013 11.86 kWh/m2 (Mean ± 2.6 %). For supply fans, the uncertainty was 0.89 Wh/m2 \u2013 1.05 Wh/m2 (Mean ± 9.3 %) with a 95 % confidence interval. In this case, the peak load of the heating coil was found to be dominated by the peak load of the reheat coil. In all Monte Carlo simulation results, the heating coil of the AHU operated at full power to handle the required heating peak load, and the remaining load not handled by the AHU was handled by the reheat coil. For this reason, there was little uncertainty in the peak load of the AHU heating coil, and the uncertainty in the peak load of the entire heating coil was found to be mainly due to the energy consumed by the reheat coil. 6 Conclusion This study investigated energy usage uncertainty in a medium-sized office building operating with occupant PMV-based OCC by stochastically modeling occupancy schedules and occupant physical characteristics. To generate inputs with uncertainty, a schedule generation model for office buildings based on Markov chains and a model to generate setpoint temperatures from occupants' characteristics (metabolic rate, clo) were established. Based on the inputs generated from these models, Monte Carlo simulations were performed to quantify the uncertainty in energy usage in an office building with OCC. The uncertainty of the setpoint temperature increased proportionally with the uncertainty of the occupancy, in spite of a lower rate, consistently showing less uncertainty than the occupancy itself. During regular working hours, the coefficient of variation of the occupancy was approximately 20 %, while the variation for the setpoint temperature remained relatively low at about 1.5 %. However, during specific periods such as lunch and commuting hours, the coefficient of variation for occupancy significantly increased, ranging from 50 % to 1400 %. Correspondingly, the coefficient of variation for the setpoint temperature also showed an increase from 8 % to 19 %. During periods of elevated occupancy, indoor temperature tended to converge toward the average of individual occupants' personal temperature settings, resulting in relatively low uncertainty in HVAC energy consumption. Conversely, during lunch and work hours with fewer occupants, the indoor set temperature was significantly influenced by the PMV of a few overtime workers or controlled by setback temperatures, leading to increased uncertainty. The uncertainty in annual cumulative energy use is approximately 1.8 % for heating and 4.3 % for cooling, determined at the 95 % confidence interval. An analysis revealed that the heightened uncertainty in heating energy compared to cooling energy can be attributed to the substantial uncertainty associated with the reheating coil situated in each zone. This underscores that systems with individual heat sources in each zone may lead to greater energy use uncertainty compared to those reliant solely on the central air handling unit (AHU). This study derives energy consumption, encompassing uncertainty, through the probabilistic modeling of input data capable of capturing the diversity and behavioral patterns of occupants. However, it is important to note that this investigation was tailored to a specific occupant schedule scenario within a building equipped with an RTU-VAV system. Variances in results may arise for cases with distinct HVAC systems or work schedules. Future work investigates the uncertainty of energy usage in buildings with OCC by applying other types of HAVC systems (e.g., VRF systems) and introducing additional occupancy scenarios.

        "dc:description": "Buildings with occupant-centric control (OCC) systems can adjust heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) operations based on occupant status to minimize unnecessary energy use. However, because occupant behavior is stochastic rather than constant, and preferred setpoints can vary across occupant groups, this randomness significantly impacts energy use in buildings with OCC systems. This study used a stochastic simulation approach to model the uncertainty inherent in occupancy patterns and evaluate its impact on the energy consumption of an office building with OCC. In this case, the setpoint temperature was determined based on the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) method so that each zone could be controlled to the preferred temperature according to the occupant group. The results showed that the uncertainty of the annualized sum of electricity consumption for heating and cooling was 4.3 % and 1.8 %, respectively, with 95 % confidence intervals. Notably, a negative correlation was observed between the number of occupants and the uncertainty of energy consumption. Thus, as the uncertainty in the setpoint temperature increased during periods of low occupancy, the uncertainty in the energy consumption of the HVAC system also tended to increase. These insights underscore the significant influence of occupancy-related factors on building energy utilization.",
