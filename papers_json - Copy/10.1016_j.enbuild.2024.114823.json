Growing renewable energy integration leads to significant fluctuations in electricity generation. To address this challenge, market-based mechanisms for dynamic carbon emission factors and electricity prices are emerging, particularly in regions like China pursuing carbon neutrality. Buildings, with HVAC systems as the largest consumers, require flexible Demand Response (DR) strategies to balance these fluctuations while maintaining occupant comfort. This paper proposes a hierarchical control framework for building HVAC systems. It optimizes operation for various objectives (minimizing energy consumption, reducing electricity costs, and lowering carbon emissions), while ensuring thermal comfort. The framework involves three modules. First is the time-based demand allocation, which uses genetic algorithms to optimize energy use based on future cooling demands, indoor temperature, and fluctuating electricity and carbon prices. It provides building-level temperature setpoints and electricity consumption plans. Second is the spatial indoor demand adjustment, which balances overall cooling load and temperature satisfaction across individual spaces, taking into account room-specific costs and difficulty confidents for temperature adjustments. This module assigns future temperature setpoints to each space. Third is HVAC system follow-up control, which Implements the optimized setpoints for real-time control of the HVAC system. The framework\u2019s effectiveness is verified through application to a real commercial building project. Compared to a baseline scenario, the optimal electricity cost strategy achieved a 6.5% cost reduction, and the optimal carbon emission reduction strategy achieved an 8.2% reduction. Real-world control based on carbon emission optimization resulted in an actual year-on-year carbon emission reduction of 8.7%.

However, the intermittent nature of RES introduces significant uncertainty and variability into the power system, posing challenges for grid reliability and stability. Flexible adjustments on the demand side, particularly in buildings, can play a crucial role in mitigating these challenges and facilitating the integration of RES. Buildings account for approximately 30 % of global energy consumption and associated CO2 emissions, making them a significant target for energy efficiency and flexibility measures. Two main approaches can be employed to achieve flexibility in buildings: energy storage and demand response. Energy storage involves storing excess energy during periods of high RES generation and releasing it when needed. Demand response involves adjusting building energy consumption in response to changes in electricity prices or grid conditions. While some building loads are inflexible (e.g., lighting, elevators), others, such as heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, offer significant flexibility potential. HVAC systems can be optimized to reduce energy consumption and adjust indoor thermal comfort demands in response to grid needs. By leveraging the flexibility of building energy loads, we can enhance grid resilience, integrate higher levels of RES, and accelerate the transition to a clean and sustainable energy future. Numerous scholars have defined and described energy flexibility, which can be categorized by various dimensions. Alstone et al. [1] identifies four types of flexibility in grid services, \u201cshape\u201d, \u201cshift\u201d, \u201cshed\u201d and \u201cshimmy\u201d, each representing a distinct method for managing or adjusting energy loads to enhance grid stability and efficiency. In the context of buildings, the demand side can leverage system control characteristics to respond to load regulation and grid modulation needs [2]. Load regulation flexibility measures the dynamic capacity of power loads to respond within the electricity market, with response times ranging from months to minutes. Grid modulation flexibility, on the other hand, measures the rapid response required for auxiliary services, such as voltage and frequency regulation, with response times down to seconds. Energy system flexibility can also be categorized and quantified from additional perspectives, as summarized in [3] and [4]. It can be classified as active or passive, depending on the ability to directly alter electricity consumption. Flexibility is further defined at various levels, including buildings, spatial areas, sub-items, and equipment. Building flexibility, in particular, is divided into thermal and non-thermal control-based types. Energy-consuming units are categorized by their adjustment time variability: continuous time-period flexibility applies to units that must operate continuously but can shift their working time, while discrete time-period flexibility pertains to units that can start or stop at any time but must meet a specified deadline. This paper primarily considers load regulation flexibility, specifically for \u201cshift\u201d loads as defined in [2], and develops quantification equations for building systems based on [4]. One approach involves integrating distributed photovoltaic (PV) generation, energy storage systems (ESS), and direct current (DC) distribution within buildings. This concept, termed PEDF (Photovoltaics, Energy Storage, Direct Current, Flexibility) by [5], offers significant potential for large-scale RES integration. Demand-side management (DSM) further enhances grid stability by coordinating building energy consumption, ESS, and renewable energy systems. The reference paper presents models for integrating buildings, ESS, and PV, along with a model predictive control framework for optimizing energy usage across these systems. Razmara et al. [6] presents a real-time optimization framework based on Model Predictive Control (MPC) for managing power flow from the grid, solar PV panels, and ESS to commercial buildings with HVAC systems, demonstrating significant reductions in maximum load ramp-rates and operational costs. Optimizing building energy usage requires real-time data, leading to potential privacy concerns for residents. To address this, Song et al. [7] proposes a data-model fusion scheduling strategy based on digital twins (DT). This method leverages a DT that combines building thermal dynamics and operational data to predict building response and optimize energy use while protecting resident privacy. Economic benefits for building occupants and grid operators are crucial for wider adoption of these strategies. Niu et al. [8] proposes a mixed-integer linear programming model for optimizing the dispatch of distributed energy systems, considering both economic benefits and grid stability. Additionally, the authors suggest three auxiliary services based on flexibility measures that can further reduce operational costs and assist grid operators. For commercial buildings, fluctuating renewable energy supplies and load uncertainty can impact power stability. To address this, Liu [9] presents a multi-timescale scheduling strategy that integrates building loads with ESS and electric vehicle charging stations. This strategy leverages an interactive control strategy between electric vehicles and buildings to optimize daily operations and short-term adjustments, ultimately reducing costs and stabilizing grid power fluctuations. While buildings offer significant potential for demand response (DR), it is crucial to maintain user comfort. To address this challenge, Tang et al. [10] proposes an optimal scheduling strategy for building clusters that utilizes a variety of flexibility measures, including controllable loads, thermal mass storage, and active power storage systems, while ensuring user comfort through an aggregated approach. Adjusting electricity use patterns based on grid conditions in buildings often involves leveraging building thermal mass and optimizing HVAC systems. Yin et al. [11] explores optimizing pre-cooling strategies for office buildings to reduce peak demand during hot weather conditions. However, traditional DR in buildings can suffer from delays that are inadequate for real-time grid needs. To address this, several studies have explored implementing fast DR strategies with HVAC systems. Xue et al. [12] proposes a fast DR control strategy for chiller units that can quickly respond to grid requests while minimizing disruption to indoor comfort. Balancing DR with maintaining a comfortable indoor environment is a key challenge. Tang et al. [13] proposes optimal and approximate optimal control strategies for environmental control during DR events. The optimal strategy utilizes model-based predictions and optimization for setting air handling unit airflow setpoints, while the approximate strategy offers simpler, rule-based control. Building energy flexibility and its availability for frequency regulation services can vary based on operating conditions. To address this, Wang et al. [14] proposes a layered optimal control strategy that utilizes a combination of a regulation bidding controller and a power use following controller. This approach optimizes building energy flexibility while ensuring indoor environmental quality. Traditional building system models often rely on simplified assumptions, potentially compromising their accuracy in reflecting real-world performance. To address this limitation, researchers are increasingly exploring data-driven approaches that leverage operational data to create more realistic performance models. One such example is presented in [15], where a method for minimizing electricity demand in district cooling systems is proposed. This approach utilizes data-driven models and a flexible, non-linear optimization strategy to optimize chiller plant operations, leading to significant reductions in peak electricity demand. Similarly, Tang et al. [16] demonstrates the effectiveness of data-driven model predictive control (MPC) using support vector regression (SVR) for implementing demand response (DR) events in commercial buildings. This approach effectively reduces power consumption while maintaining acceptable indoor comfort levels. Accurate time series forecasting is crucial for implementing flexible DR strategies, and several common algorithms are employed for this purpose. Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) combines autoregressive (AR), differencing (I), and moving average (MA) components [17]. It is suitable for stationary data with trends and seasonality. Exponential Smoothing (ES) [18] is a simple yet effective method, prioritizing recent observations by assigning exponentially decreasing weights to past data points. It excels at short-term forecasting for data with trends and seasonality. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) [19] is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that can learn long-term dependencies within time series data. It is widely used for sequential data modeling and can capture complex patterns in the data. XGBoost [20], a gradient boosting algorithm, is known for its speed and accuracy. It builds an ensemble of weak learners sequentially, where each subsequent learner focuses on correcting the mistakes of the previous one. XGBoost's ability to handle non-linear relationships makes it well-suited for time series forecasting with complex patterns. However, due to the inherent complexity of buildings and their mechanical systems, relying on a single forecasting algorithm may not be sufficient. Therefore, this study explores methods that combine physical principles with machine learning algorithms to achieve more accurate and realistic predictions. The time-based allocation of electricity use is another critical technique for the DR strategies. There are various algorithms for solving optimization problem. Greedy Algorithm [21] makes decisions based on current local optimal solutions, simple and efficient but may not find the global optimum. Dynamic Programming [22] decomposes problems into subproblems, calculates local optimal solutions through recursion, and combines them to find the global optimum. Efficient but requires designing suitable state transition equations. Particle Swarm Algorithm [23] simulates the behavior of particles to search for optimal solutions, with fast search speed and high accuracy, but lacks theoretical support and requires adjustments based on specific problems. Simulated Annealing Algorithm [24] simulates the annealing process to search a broader solution space, suitable for high-dimensional and complex problems, but requires extensive parameter tuning and experimentation. Genetic Algorithm [25] simulates biological evolution using genetic operators to search for optimal solutions, suitable for complex problems but requires extensive parameter tuning and experimentation. As its complicity of the task studied in this paper, genetic algorithm is more applicable and can be combined with other models to solve the optimization problem. To further highlight the unique contributions of our work, we present a comparison table that summarizes the innovative aspects of our approach in relation to existing studies (Table 1 ). 1.2 Motivation and objectives Previous research has primarily relied on simulation-based approaches, which may not provide direct guidance for operating real HVAC systems, considering the crucial factors of stability and accuracy. Notably absent from prior studies is the consideration of fluctuating carbon emission factors, which are becoming increasingly important in China's pursuit of carbon neutrality. This paper proposes a comprehensive framework for the gradual integration of demand response mechanisms across various timescales, encompassing diverse value selections. The following section details the methodology of DR control, including the hierarchical strategy framework, corresponding approaches, and practical implementation. The subsequent case study section presents real-world applications and scenarios where the proposed framework has been applied, offering valuable insights into its practical implications. Then, the next section discusses method improvement, shortcomings, and result comparisons. Finally, the conclusion section summarizes the key findings and implications of the study, providing a comprehensive overview of the framework's potential impact and future directions. 2 Methodology 2.1 Framework of the methodology The proposed demand response control strategy involves three key components: building demand allocation, spatial demand interpretation, and system control, as depicted in Fig. 1 . The optimal objective can be selected from among energy consumption, carbon emissions, and electricity cost. Initially, the building's electricity usage is allocated based on indoor temperature requirements and the chosen optimization objectives. Next, the building's time series targets are disaggregated into individual rooms according to their specific characteristics. Finally, the cooling load and temperature settings are used to inform control strategies for equipment such as chillers and AC terminals. A day-ahead building demand schedule is calculated based on the priority of the selected value. When indoor temperature is the priority, the calculation relies on the building's average indoor temperature target and the work demand schedule, aiming for optimal electricity use. This results in a time series cooling load forecast, serving as the baseline for comparison with other strategies. If electricity cost is the priority, an optimization process combines the baseline cooling electricity use with the electricity price to calculate the time-based cooling load allocation strategy. Similarly, if carbon emissions are the priority, an optimization process integrates the baseline cooling electricity use with the time-of-use carbon emission factor to determine the time-based cooling load allocation strategy. The module outputs include the building's indoor temperature settings and the electricity use of the cooling load as a time series. A uniform indoor temperature setting for the entire building may not be feasible, as each room has unique characteristics, including occupancy temperature requirements, room importance, the difficulty of achieving the temperature target, and individual cooling costs. The mechanism of transferring the building set to each space set segregates the uniform target into individual targets. Multiple space features, such as room area, average indoor temperature, interior/exterior zone, and room orientation, are used to evaluate the difficulty in achieving the goal (difficulty coefficient) and the cost for space cooling (cost coefficient). Subsequently, the difficulty coefficient, cost coefficient, building indoor temperature settings, and cooling load are integrated into a comprehensive iterative calculation to balance the load and indoor temperature, thereby allocating indoor temperature targets to each room. The iterative process is divided into three steps. Firstly, considering the ranking of the difficulty coefficient and the temperature set choices (defined later), all the rooms' indoor temperatures are reset as candidates. Secondly, the building's average temperature is calculated based on the temperature set candidates and compared with the building temperature set. If they are sufficiently close, proceed to the next step; if not, adjust the individual room temperature settings. Thirdly, all the room cooling loads are summed and compared with the building cooling load. If they are sufficiently close, the temperature set for each room is finalized; otherwise, the individual room temperatures are adjusted again. The modules for building demand assignment and space demand interpretation will be extensively described in the following sections, detailing the methodology and algorithms. 2.2 Prediction algorithm Accurate forecasting of future cooling load and room temperature are the prerequisites for building demand assignment and space demand interpretation. This section will introduce the proposed algorithms for these two tasks. 2.2.1 Cooling load prediction Given that control strategies and actions can vary significantly and extend beyond past operating conditions, ensuring the accuracy of load sequence predictions under DR changes is both a challenging and critical issue. Based on the heat balance equilibrium of a typical building, the cooling load provided by the air conditioning system can be expressed by Eq. (1). The original heat balance equilibrium is detailed in Appendix A. (1) Q cooling l o a d = Q bui + Q rad w i n d o w + Q heat s o u r c e + Q a i r e x - Δ Q sen - Δ Q lat # where Q bui is the combined effect of Q env i n and Q inner . To explain how to calculate Q bui , a simplified equivalent RC model is illustrated in Fig. 2 , which analyzes temperature dynamics in response to heat inputs or losses. The thermal potential difference between indoor and outdoor air is u i ( t ) = T out ( t ) - T in ( t ) , and the thermal potential difference between the building and indoor air is u c ( t ) = T bui ( t ) - T in ( t ) . Based on the Laplace transform and derivation process of the equations, u c ( t ) can be expressed as Eq. (2). The detailed derivation is provided in Appendix B. (2) u c ( t ) = 1 - ξ ∑ k = 0 n [ u i t - k ∗ ξ k ] # where ξ is expressed as e - τ R bui C bui , and τ is the time constant for the RC model. n is the number of time steps from the current time t to the past, which is taken as 48 h in our study. Finally, by substituting the expansion of u c ( t ) into Eq. (3) from the RC model, Q bui is presented as Eq. (4). (3) Q bui t = u c t ∗ A bui R bui # (4) Q bui = 1 - ξ ∑ k = 0 n [ T out ( t - k ) - T in ( t - k ) ∗ ξ k ] ∗ A bui R bui # In Appendix C, the expressions of Q radwind , Q heat s o u r c e , Q air e x , Δ Q sen , and Δ Q lat are provided. The final expression incorporating all the available parameters is presented as Eq. (5). (5) Q cooling l o a d = 1 - ξ ∑ k = 0 n [ T out ( t - k ) - T in ( t - k ) ∗ ξ k ] ∗ A bui R bui + I rad ( t ) ∗ κ + W ( t ) ∗ α + ρ out ∗ φ ven ∗ M in ∗ ( h out ( t ) - h in ( t ) ) - ρ i n M i n C in d T in t dt - ρ in M in Δ H vap dwe t in ( t ) dt # In this study, parameters T out , h out , I rad , T in , h in , h in and we t in are dynamic data. Conversely, ρ i n , ρ out , M in , C in and Δ H vap are considered static parameters, based on project-specific information, indoor and outdoor temperature and humidity ranges. The energy consumption W , representing internal heat generation, will be forecasted using a time-series prediction model. While the specific prediction algorithm is not the focus of this paper, any machine learning technique could be employed. The parameter ξ , which is related to the thermal conductivity, heat capacity, thickness, and density of the building envelope materials, ranges between 0.92 and 0.98, based on validation across ten commercial building projects. For model training, ξ is fixed at 0.95. The ratio A bui R bui (building area divided by thermal resistance) can be approximated as a constant value for a specific project, which will be determined during model training. The ventilation rate φ ven is also assumed to remain relatively constant for a project, and its value will be fine-tuned between 0.2 and 0.7 during parameter optimization. To sum up, after substituting the known values, Eq. (5) becomes a multivariate linear function. The parameters requiring estimation through model training include A bui R bui , κ , α and φ ven . A multiple linear regression model is employed to evaluate these equilibrium parameters due to its stability and interpretability. 2.2.2 Room temperature prediction method The methodology of predicting indoor temperatures in building spaces combines physics-based modeling and data-driven methods. According to the heat balance of a typical room, the change rate in sensible heat and latent heat equals the sum of Q rad , Q cond , Q conv and Q inside . Q rad is influenced by the room\u2019s orientation, window to wall ratio, whether it is an interior or exterior zone, and whether it is on the top floor. Q cond and Q conv are related to the surrounding space temperature, and fresh air heat exchange, respectively. Q inside is the heat load produced by occupancy and equipment, which depends on the space\u2019s function type. Based on physical analysis and numerous experiments, critical features are identified and grouped according to two perspectives: dynamic or static, and past or future. Static information includes room orientation, whether the room is on the top floor, whether it is an interior or exterior zone, and the rated capacity of the associated terminal unit. Dynamic variables from past time periods include indoor environment conditions (indoor air temperature, average temperature of neighboring rooms), weather conditions (outside air temperature, outside humidity), terminal units variables (inlet temperature, outlet temperature, status, fan gear), and time-related factors (day of the year, day of the week, weekday or weekend, hour of the day). Weather conditions and time-related factors are also used as future features. Given sufficient data on indoor environments and terminal units, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network can effectively extract valuable information from dynamic variables to generate single-step rolling predictions. In the LSTM model, the cell state is responsible for storing and transmitting information, and is updated and controlled by input, forget, and output gates. By introducing gate control mechanisms, the flow of gradients can be effectively regulated, mitigating the issues of vanishing and exploding gradients. This results in stronger long-term dependency modeling capabilities, enabling better handling of short-term and long-distance dependencies. To address the absence of certain dynamic variables, a decision tree method was devised, leveraging categories of static features and available dynamic variables. The approach proceeds as follows: 1). Room Grouping: Rooms are categorized into groups based on statistical features, forming a hierarchical category tree. 2). Model Construction: For each room group, proceeding from the bottom to the top of the tree, available dynamic variables are employed to construct forecasting models using the XGBoost algorithm. 3). Model Selection: Prediction results are compared across levels, ascending from the bottom to the top, to determine the optimal model for each room. The model exhibiting the highest R-squared value (R2) is selected, with prioritization given to upper-level models in cases of equal accuracy. For example (Fig. 3 ), a room characterized as \u201cnot on the top floor,\u201d \u201cexterior room,\u201d and \u201cSouth,\u201d with R2 values of 0.87, 0.78, 0.71, and 0.65 from bottom to top, would select the bottom-level model with the highest R2 of 0.87 for indoor temperature forecasting. Each approach offers distinct strengths and weaknesses. LSTM models leverage all dynamic data for each room, potentially achieving higher accuracy. However, they require high-quality data and their robustness deteriorates significantly with missing information. Conversely, decision tree models incorporate the crucial impact of static features. While they may not be as precise for individual rooms, they typically exhibit minimal bias and maintain consistent uncertainty. Therefore, in practical engineering applications, a self-assessment process determines whether each space warrants the power of an LSTM model or necessitates the stability of a decision tree model for temperature prediction. The self-assessment process is not the focus of this paper and will not be discussed in detail. 2.3 Control strategy for cooling load demand The control strategy relies on predicting the cooling load, which is then converted to electricity usage for cost or carbon emission calculations. Different value-based choices influence the operation strategy of the building's cooling system. The choices include minimizing electricity consumption, reducing electricity costs, and lowering carbon emissions. Accordingly, the optimization objectives are different. The objective of the first choice is to minimizing electricity consumption while maintaining the building\u2019s indoor temperature close to the set target. The second choice\u2019s optimization objective is to minimize total electricity cost by considering fluctuating electricity prices. The third objective is to minimize carbon emissions, taking into account the carbon emission factor. Building energy management for demand response requires both long-term and short-term load allocation. Long-term allocation is responsible for estimating the 24-hour load demand curve and adjusting the load plan as a reference for flexible control objectives. It periodically checks the load forecasting and decides whether to update the load allocation plan. For short-term allocation (within one hour), it calculates load demand and adjusts the load of individual flexible control objects. Flexible control objects generally include HVAC, lighting, energy storage, charging stations, etc. Optimization involves defining the problem, formulating objective functions, identifying constraints and selecting appropriate algorithms. The general representation of the optimization problem-solving process is defined as follows. (6) minimize ∑ t = 1 N ∑ i = 1 M 1 ω i J i x t , u t + ∑ j = 1 M 2 v j R j x t , u t # f x t , u t = 0 , ∀ t ∈ 1 , ⋯ , N g x t , u t ≤ 0 , ∀ t ∈ 1 , ⋯ , N x t ∈ X , ∀ t ∈ 1 , ⋯ , N u t ∈ U , ∀ t ∈ 1 , ⋯ , N where x t denotes the state vector of object, which could be a building, system, equipment, etc. u t is the control vector for actions, including adjusting load or controlling equipment. J i and ω i denote the ith optimization objective and its weight coefficient. R j and v j denote the jth penalty term and its weight coefficient. M 1 and M 2 represent the number of optimization objectives and penalty terms, respectively. N denotes the time steps of the optimization period. f and g express the functions with equation constraints and inequality constraints. X and U represent the feasible spaces of the state vector and control actions. The optimization problem in this research focuses on the load allocation of HVAC use, which is considered as the only source of the flexibility. The transfer flexibility from HVAC is denoted as L HVAC , and it includes the predicted HVAC power ( P HVAC , b ), the upper and lower limits of operating power ( P op , h and P op , l ), and the power limits caused by the upper limit and lower limit of indoor temperature ( P in , h and P in , l ). (7) L HVAC t = min P op , h - P HVAC , b t , P in , h t - P HVAC , b t , P HVAC , b t - P op , l , P HVAC , b t - P in , l t # For value selections other than energy priority, the optimized target is either electricity cost or carbon emissions, defined for each period as Eq. (8). (8) J 1 x t , u t = C t P HVAC t # where C ( t ) is the fluctuating factor for every 15 min, which is electricity price for cost target, and carbon emission factor for carbon target. P HVAC ( t ) is the average electricity power for HVAC use for the same period. The limit condition based on the flexibility from HVAC is P HVAC , b t - L HVAC t ≤ P HVAC t ≤ P HVAC , b t + L HVAC ( t ) , and the indoor temperature limit condition during the service time is T set , l ≤ T in ( t ) ≤ T set , h . The electricity power for HVAC can be calculated based on the cooling load and system efficiency. The main components of consumption are from the chiller plant system and terminal units. The chiller plant includes the chiller, cooling tower, pumps, etc., with their electricity use estimations illustrated, respectively. According to the reverse Carnot cycle, under ideal conditions, the relationship between the chiller COP and the condenser cooling water inlet temperature ( tw ), and the evaporator outlet water temperature ( ts ) is depicted in Eq. (9). The ratio of the COP at the condition of tw and ts to the COP at ratedcondition is denoted as η tw , t s , as illustrated in Eq. (10). (9) CO P Chiller = ts tw - t s # (10) η tw , t s = CO P chiller CO P chiller , r a t e d # Undertheratedconditions, the relationship between cooling load and rated power of chiller is illustrated in Eq. (11), where a 0 through a 3 are the weight coefficients. Subsequently, the electricity power of the chiller is presented in Eq. (12). (11) P chiller , r a t e d = a 0 + a 1 Q + a 2 Q 2 + a 3 Q 3 # (12) P chiller = P chiller , r a t e d η tw , t s # For constant speed cooling towers, linear interpolation is used to calculate the tower power as shown below. (13) P tower = r tower , o n ∗ P tower , r a t e d # The power of the pump is calculated as shown in Eq. (14), and the rated power of the pump under standard conditions is corrected based on the actual operating head, as indicated in Eq. (15). The current load ratio is calculated based on the ratio of the actual frequency to the full load frequency, which is expressed in Eq. (16). (14) P pump = P pump , r a t e d ∗ iPLR pump # (15) P pump , r a t e d = ρ gh pump V pump , r a t e d η pump # (16) iPLR pump = a 0 + a 1 P L R pump + a 2 PL R pump 2 + a 3 PL R pump 3 # The calculation of the terminal unit fan\u2019s power is similar to the way for the pump, which is shown as followings from Eq. (17) through (19). (17) P terminal u n i t s = P fan , r a t e d ∗ i P L R fan # (18) P fan r a t e d = F fan ∗ V fan , r a t e d η fan # (19) iPLR fan = a 0 + a 1 P L R fan + a 2 PL R fan 2 + a 3 PL R fan 3 # Considering that the control changes of the chiller system are not rapid and have a certain delay, it is not necessary to solve short-term (within one hour) optimization problems. However, the adjustments based on space demand are frequent, typically occurring every 15 min. For the optimization problem of time-based cooling load allocation, a genetic algorithm is employed. The first step in implementing this algorithm is to design the fitness function, which calculates the goodness of a solution based on the individual's genes. For instance, if the optimization goal is to reduce carbon emissions, the fitness function value is the reciprocal of the carbon emissions over a period of time (the greater the carbon reduction, the higher the fitness function value). The implementation process of the genetic algorithm is described as follows: 1). Initialize the population by randomly generating individuals with random 15-minute cooling loads for a period, encoding their genes, and calculating fitness values. 2). Select the fittest individuals as parents and perform single-point crossover to create new offspring. 3). Mutate the new individuals by adjusting their 15-minute cooling loads. 4). Check constraints and remove invalid solutions. 5). Evaluate the fitness of the next generation, select the best solutions, and form a new population. 6). Repeat this process until reaching the specified number of iterations. 7). Output the optimal solution, including the time series of cooling loads and the building's indoor temperature targets. 2.4 Control strategy for space demand To achieve optimized building load targets in response to fluctuating factors, spatial optimization must be accompanied by a detailed decoupling strategy. Since the primary concern is to provide occupants with a comfortable indoor environment, demand response adjustments should be implemented in a bidirectional manner rather than a unidirectional approach. The room setpoint needs to not only track the building's planned demand but also meet the requirements of most rooms to the greatest extent possible. Determining which room to sacrifice and how to set the temperature setpoint for each room is a complex task due to the large number of rooms and their diverse characteristics. This control strategy module aims to formulate a mechanism to balance the overall indoor environment of all rooms and closely align with the building's demand response goals. The definitions of the parameters and their calculation methods are introduced as follows. Tin represents the time series of the average indoor temperature of the building, which is calculated from the building cooling load dispatch. Ttarget , TlimitH , and TlimitL denote the optimal target room temperature, the upper limit temperature for energy saving, and the lower limit temperature for thermal storage, respectively. ton indicates the pre-start time of space air conditioning, calculated from the current indoor temperature to the target temperature using a fitted temperature drop curve. Conversely, the pre-stop time of space air conditioning is represented as toff and is calculated in the same way. The parameter fd denotes the difficulty coefficient, reflecting the control difficulty of space cooling based on the current indoor temperature and the target temperature. This coefficient is estimated considering the physical characteristics of the space and the cooling capability of the terminal unit. The manually designed feature parameters are defined and their underlying considerations are provided in Table 2 . The parameters listed above require normalization using different methods. Bounded normalization is defined as follows: for all controllable spaces in a project, the 10th and 90th percentiles of the calculation parameters for all spaces are taken as the lower and upper limits, corresponding to values of 0 and 1. Spaces below the lower limit are assigned a value of 0, those above the upper limit are assigned a value of 1, and spaces between the limits are normalized proportionally. Unbounded normalization is similar, but all values are normalized proportionally, with values below the 10th percentile being negative and values above the 90th percentile exceeding 1. Parameters b, c, and s are normalized using bounded normalization. This is because these parameters are calculated based on historical data only, and it is necessary to avoid the phenomenon that some space parameters are abnormally low or high compared to other space parameters, which will lead to serious outliers in the difficulty coefficient. Parameter d compares the current setpoint with the historical setpoint. If the current setpoint is too high or low, resulting in an extremely low or high difficulty coefficient, it is reasonable. Therefore, unbounded normalization is used. The difficulty coefficient is influenced by all these factors and is calculated as shown in Eq. (20). A higher average temperature leads to a higher cooling load and increased cooling difficulty. Therefore, the weighting coefficient for b is positive. A larger daily temperature range indicates stronger cooling capacity, making cooling easier. Hence, the weighting coefficient for c is negative. A larger difference between historical actual temperature and set temperature suggests a greater challenge in meeting cooling demand. Consequently, the weighting coefficient for s is positive. A higher current temperature target compared to the historical temperature target implies easier achievement of the target. Therefore, the weighting coefficient for d is negative. The specific values of these weighting coefficients are determined based on experimental design and careful analysis of difficulty coefficients across various spaces. Through iterative adjustments and qualitative comparisons, the coefficients are refined until they consistently produce reasonable results. (20) f d = b - c + 2 s - 2 d # The difficulty coefficient is a metric employed to assess the challenge of attaining a designated temperature setpoint in a given space based on its specific inherent characteristics. Regardless of its size, a space may be either challenging or straightforward to regulate the conditioning. To calculate the absolute cooling load associated with a space, a parameter termed q in is computed, which quantifying the cooling load required to reach the temperature setpoint. Individual space cooling loads are determined within the context of the estimated total building cooling load at a specific time point. The process is as follows: 1). Compute each space's difficulty coefficient based on the building indoor temperature (Tin ) as the room temperature set, and then multiply its space area. The product is denoted as s . 2). Derive a proportional ratio with building cooling load and the sum of all the s ( r adj = Q / ∑ s ). 3). Estimate individual space cooling load q in as multiplying s by r adj . s could be changed based on different room temperature set. Then, the methodology scheme for the space demand management is presented in Fig. 4 . Decision Module 1 assigns temperature setpoints to each space, depicted in Fig. 5 . If the building temperature (Tin ) is below Ttarget , building load flexibility is utilized to store cooling. Each room temperature is set to Ttarget or TlimitL to align the average room temperature with Tin , while ensuring that the sum of space cooling loads closely matches the building cooling load. Conversely, if Tin exceeds Ttarget , each room's temperature is set to Ttarget or TlimitH . The procedure to calculate room temperature setting is stated as following example. 1). If Tin < Ttarget , calculate the assignment ratio denoted as a. (21) a = T in - T limitL T target - T limitL # Rank all n rooms by their calculated difficulty factors from low to high. Set the temperature setpoints of the first n × a rooms to Ttarget , while the remaining rooms are set to TlimitL . 2). Based on the calculated cooling load for each room depending on the temperature set, compare the sum of all room cooling loads to the building cooling load. If the difference exceeds the threshold (5 %), intentionally switch the temperature settings of two rooms with different settings to minimize the difference and recalculate the loads. Room selection starts from the sorting crossover to the two extremes of difficulty factors gradually. 3). The process terminates when there are no more room switches or when the load difference falls below the threshold. Decision Module 2 is proposed to set the on and off times for each space, as illustrated in Fig. 6 . The procedure for rooms\u2019 start time setting is described below. 1). Compute the start time (ton ) for each room by subtracting the estimated time required for temperature reduction, based on the room temperature prediction method, from the occupancy start time. 2. If m rooms have ton no later than the chiller plant start time, align the ton of these rooms to the chiller plant start time 3. Calculate the sum of m rooms\u2019 cooling loads at the chiller plant start time. If this sum exceeds the estimated building cooling load, adjust m rooms\u2019 temperature settings. If the sum of m rooms\u2019 loads is less than the building cooling load, additional rooms from the remaining are selected for early start, prioritized from early to late. When adjusting the start times of room cooling cannot meet the building cooling load requirements, rooms\u2019 temperature settings will be adjusted, as the same procedure as Decision Module 1. Correspondingly, the toff for each room is set following a similar procedure. 3 Case study 3.1 Test example The methodology presented in previous chapter is applied to a real building project, and the analysis results are introduced. This test case involves a commercial plaza in Beijing with a building area of 230,000 m2, constructed in Dec 2016. The main HVAC equipment is listed in Table 3 . The project utilizes a peak-valley electricity pricing mechanism, with the schedule detailed in Table 4 . The fluctuating carbon emission factor for the building's location in 2023 has been recorded, and Table 5 summarizes key statistical indices of this factor. Leveraging instance objects from the building project, the process commences with data acquisition and preprocessing to comprehensively gather and refine information essential for predictive modeling and optimization control. Subsequently, model training is undertaken using the algorithm outlined in Section 2.2. This phase encompasses the development and training of predictive models, including load forecasting and indoor temperature prediction. An optimization model for building demand assignment is then formulated to efficiently manage energy consumption while adhering to demand response principles, as detailed in Section 2.3. The subsequent space demand interpretation process is executed based on the target allocation mechanisms described in Section 2.4. The system is finally deployed for real-time operation, continuously acquiring data, generating predictions, and conducting hierarchical analyses to inform the development of control strategies. This ensures optimal performance and effective demand response. 3.2 Results and analysis 3.2.1 Case analysis based on the project Based on the project information and data, calculations and comparative analyses are conducted for various cases. The estimated results for different control actions aimed at minimizing energy consumption, reducing electricity costs, and lowering carbon emissions are presented below. Fig. 7 (a) and (b) show the time series of electricity prices and carbon emission factors for an entire day. Fig. 7 (c) compares the cooling load curves for these three optimization objectives, while Fig. 7 (d) shows the comparison of the building's average indoor temperature. The plots indicate that the allocated loads and indoor temperatures change synchronously. Based on theoretical analysis and calculations during a typical summer season, Table 6 presents the average indoor temperature, total electricity consumption, total electricity cost, and total carbon emissions over three months (June 1st to August 31st) for the three optimization objectives. By comparing the predicted results, it is observed that each optimization objective corresponds to its optimal indicator statistics, meeting expectations while maintaining a similar daily average indoor temperature. The optimal electricity cost strategy can reduce costs by 6.5 %, and the optimal carbon emission reduction strategy can reduce emissions by 8.2 %, compared to the baseline scenario of optimal energy consumption. 3.2.2 Actual operation results of the project The algorithm is implemented using a systematic engineering approach to achieve real-time online control, based on the optimal value selection for minimizing carbon emissions. For a typical summer day, Fig. 8 illustrates the impact of the carbon emission factor on the temperature setpoint for each room. The figure shows the temperature setpoints (e.g., TlimitH =26 °C, Ttarget = 24 °C, TlimitL =22 °C) for all spaces, arranged by floors from LG to L7, at different time slices throughout the day. At 10:00 AM, due to a low carbon factor, some spaces have their temperature set to TlimitL to store cooling energy in advance. At 15:00 PM, with a high carbon factor, some spaces are set to TlimitH to minimize carbon emissions by moderately reducing the building's cooling load. By 20:00 PM, despite the typically indicative low carbon factor for cooling energy storage, there is no necessity for it due to the building\u2019s approaching closing time. Fig. 9 presents the time series data for control actions, related indices, and space environment satisfaction. The space environment satisfaction rate is calculated as the percentage of spaces that have reached their real-time temperature setpoint (considered satisfactory if the temperature is equal to or lower than the setpoint). Fluctuations in carbon emission factors lead to adjustments in the temperature setpoints of all rooms, resulting in changes in the control actions of the cooling system and ultimately affecting the HVAC system's electricity consumption. These changes in cooling control lead to variations in the actual temperatures of all rooms, allowing for real-time calculation of the building's average temperature and indoor environment satisfaction rate. In the actual control process, data loss and network fluctuations are common occurrences. To ensure the reliability and stability of actual control, several backup strategies are provided. For example, a 7-day chiller operation strategy is continuously generated based on the available weather forecast data each day. When real-time data is updated, the prediction strategy generated with the latest data is followed. If deviations from the target occur, feedback logic is used to correct them, ensuring the basic operation of the project. Some constraints for the correction include, but are not limited to, the range of chiller quantity, the range of chiller supply water temperature settings, the range of chiller current load rates, and the earliest start and stop time limits for the space. 4 Discussion Comparison of Prediction Methods The methods for cooling load prediction and indoor temperature prediction proposed in this paper are compared with other commonly used methods. Table 7 presents the comparison results among XGBoost, LSTM, and the proposed method for cooling load prediction during the summer season (June 1st to August 31st). 24-hour forecasting is required at a time because the prediction results will be used for time-based allocation throughout the day. Compared to XGBoost, the proposed method has decreased MAE and RMSE by 52 %, and increased R2 by 11 %. LSTM performs worse than XGBoost in this case because LSTM is more prone to overfitting, especially when dealing with noisy or sparse data. The proposed method thoroughly considers the physicality of the building and the impact of time, thus significantly improving prediction accuracy. For better understanding the accuracy, Fig. 10 shows a representative time series plot for a typical summer day. The prediction from the proposed method closely aligns with the real data, including the start and end points. However, the algorithm may struggle to capture sudden changes in cooling load due to unmeasurable factors, leading to unpredictable errors. Since room temperature target allocation requires accurate short-term predictions, the predictions were conducted for every 4-hour interval. The performance indices for various methods for all spaces during the summer season are summarized in Table 8 . Compared to LSTM, the proposed method decreased MAE by 28 % and RMSE by 22 %, and increased R2 by 4 %. XGBoost performs worst for the short-term prediction task among the three methods, as it is a tree-based model not designed to capture sequential patterns in time series data. However, missing or lower-quality data can significantly deteriorate LSTM's performance. The proposed method switches between LSTM and a decision tree method based on self-assessment. Selecting a space with median accuracy from all spaces and using average weather data to find a typical summer day, Fig. 11 shows the profile plot of one sample room. The data quality is good, and thus the prediction curve of the proposed method overlaps with the LSTM result. The two ways for estimating room temperature in the proposed method were employed for all rooms, and their MAE distributions are compared in Fig. 12 , indicating significant improvement in cases with sufficient data using the LSTM method compared to the decision tree method. Evaluation of the room indicator calculation There is no objective and practical evaluation method for the difficulty coefficient and cooling load calculation of spaces. Fortunately, in algorithms, the focus is more on matching the total load of spaces with the load predictions of the building rather than evaluating individual space indices. As long as the cumulative effect of all space control targets is relatively accurate, the feasibility of the solution will not be hindered. Therefore, it is sufficient to verify the reasonableness of the calculation rules through qualitative judgment and real project practice. The difficulty coefficients of the 126 spaces for the test project were calculated based on the proposed methods. Fig. 13 shows the difficulty coefficient values and their processing parameters as defined at a specific time slice. From the plots, it is observed that rooms with lower temperature settings have higher difficulty coefficients, which aligns with common sense. For the same indoor temperature setting of 25 °C, comparing two instance rooms (Room 126 and Room 99), Room 99 has a relatively higher difficulty coefficient than Room 126 because Room 126 has a lower historical base score (b) and historical reach target score (s), and a higher current relative difficulty score (d) compared to Room 99. Between Room 52 and Room 65, both set at 23 °C, the difficulty coefficient of Room 52 is higher than Room 65, as Room 65 has a higher d score. Room 41 has the highest difficulty coefficient among the rooms, since its s and b scores are very high, and c and d scores are relatively low. Room 118 has the lowest difficulty coefficient, as its b and s scores are very low. All space cooling loads are estimated based on the method described in the previous chapter. Fig. 14 shows the difficulty coefficient, space area, and estimated cooling load. By comparing the cooling loads across several spaces, some observations are obtained: Firstly, despite having a high difficulty coefficient, Room 41 exhibits a moderate cooling load due to its relatively small area. Secondly, Room 64 almost requires no cooling load due to its compact size and low difficulty coefficient. Thirdly, Room 126, characterized by a difficulty coefficient of 0, has no cooling load requirement regardless of its area. Finally, Room 68 has the highest cooling cost because of its high difficulty coefficient and large area. After practical verification in multiple projects, the approach has achieved the goal of flexible control while maintaining the indoor environmental temperature within the preset target range. Key factors for carbon reduction potential From June 1st to August 31st, the carbon reduction achieved in this test project compared to the same period last year is 66.2 tons, representing a reduction of 8.7 %. Several important factors determine the relative carbon reduction potential, including the fluctuation of carbon emission factors, the alignment between the original electricity consumption curve and the emission factor curve, and the setting range of indoor temperature requirements. The greater the fluctuation of carbon emission factors, the greater the potential for carbon reduction; conversely, if carbon emission factors remain almost constant, there is no potential for reducing carbon emissions. The closer the original electricity use trend aligns with the carbon emission factors trend, the greater the carbon reduction potential. Additionally, the wider the indoor temperature target range, the greater the controllable range, and consequently, the greater the potential for carbon reduction. Discussion of the methodology application The proposed methodology in this paper introduces a hierarchical control framework designed to optimize the operation of HVAC systems in buildings, with a focus on minimizing energy consumption, reducing electricity costs, and lowering carbon emissions, all while ensuring thermal comfort. This approach offers a more granular level of control compared to existing methodologies in the literature. While many current frameworks focus on building-level energy optimization, such as those integrating photovoltaic (PV) generation and energy storage systems [5\u20139], our methodology goes further by adjusting temperature setpoints and cooling loads at the individual space level. This granularity allows for a more refined approach to maintaining occupant comfort, adapting to the specific needs of different spaces within the building, which is a significant advantage in real-world applications. Another notable strength of the proposed methodology is its demonstrated practical viability. The framework has been successfully applied in a real commercial building project, where it achieved significant reductions in carbon emissions. This successful implementation not only underscores the effectiveness of the proposed approach but also highlights its adaptability to real-world scenarios, particularly in regions like China where dynamic carbon emission factors are becoming increasingly relevant. However, despite these strengths, there are certain limitations to the methodology that must be acknowledged. The current focus of our research is primarily on HVAC systems and indoor thermal comfort, which, while crucial, does not extend to broader building energy systems such as integrated PV generation, energy storage, or electric vehicle charging stations [5,6,8]. Although the framework is designed to be compatible with various systems and building types, its applicability in buildings with these specific systems still requires further validation. Furthermore, the study is confined to single-building scenarios, whereas other studies have indicated that collaborative demand response strategies across building clusters or districts could offer enhanced flexibility and energy optimization [10,15]. Expanding the research to encompass building clusters may provide opportunities for better leveraging the combined energy flexibility of multiple buildings, which could lead to more substantial energy savings and grid stability. Another area to consider in the methodology is its focus on the time scale of demand response. The current approach is designed to address demand response over medium to long time periods, specifically targeting adjustments in building operations that span several hours to a day. These adjustments are driven by changes in electricity prices or carbon emission factors, aiming to optimize energy use and emissions across these extended periods. While the framework does incorporate more frequent adjustments within the building, such as the 15-minute temperature setpoint adjustments to balance total cooling load, it does not engage in rapid response mechanisms directly linked to real-time grid demands. Instead, the \u201cfast response\u201d in this context refers to the internal adjustments within the building's spaces, rather than an immediate reaction to grid signals. Some studies [12,13,14,16] have explored methods for fast response strategies for chiller and air handling units (AHU) based on simulation platforms. As the need for real-time grid interaction grows, expanding our methodology to include direct, fast-response capabilities may be a valuable direction for future research. 5 Conclusion This paper presents a framework for building control strategy with a focus on HVAC optimization. The proposed methodology integrates load demand response and space demand management. The approach utilizes a genetic algorithm to allocate cooling load across time dimension while considering flexibility constraints. Subsequently, space demands are comprehensively managed based on the estimated building load using the proposed mechanism. Then main conclusions of this research are as follows: \u2022 The coupling of overall cooling load regulation and space demand management in buildings is a challenging problem. This study proposes a hierarchical processing approach that effectively addresses this problem by decomposing the pursuit of multiple objectives into first solving the optimization of building load allocation and then matching of space demand and cooling load. Implementing the proposed approach leads to reasonable and effective control strategies. \u2022 This study combines physics-based models with machine learning algorithms to develop a predictive algorithm with good stability and robustness. The cooling load prediction model applies the analysis results of the physics model to guide the multiple linear regression model to capture the physical laws comprehensively, and can yield interpretable prediction results. In the prediction of indoor temperature in multiple spatial areas, different data conditions are considered. An LSTM model for the case of sufficient data information and a proposed decision tree method for the case of partial dynamic data are used to achieve a balance between stability and accuracy. The proposed methods for cooling load prediction and indoor temperature forecasting have increased R2 by 11 % and 4 %, respectively, comparing with the other methods. \u2022 In this paper, the calculation of flexibility is incorporated into the standard framework of optimization for control strategy. The power range and indoor temperature range in the demand response control strategy of the chiller plant are treated as constraints for flexibility control and integrated into the problem-solving framework. This method can be extended to the construction of flexibility control problems for other controllable devices or even the entire building system. \u2022 Many previous studies have tested strategy methods based on simulation models. In contrast, this study applies the proposed method to a real commercial building project in practice. To improve the reliability and stability of the strategy, many logical strategies are added according to the actual engineering application. Good application results have been obtained. \u2022 This study applies calculation based on different value choices, including energy consumption optimization, electricity cost optimization, and carbon emission optimization. The theoretical analysis for the test project shows that, under the premise of maintaining environmental quality, the optimal electricity cost strategy can reduce electricity costs by 6.5 %, and the optimal carbon emission reduction strategy can reduce carbon emissions by 8.2 %, compared to the baseline scenario of optimal energy consumption. The results of actual control based on optimal carbon emission indicate that year-on-year carbon emission reduction has reached 8.7 %. On the other hand, there are some limitations to our study. The proposed RC strategy method integrates a combination of physical modeling, machine learning algorithm, optimization solving, and logical flow mechanisms with experimental design. This multifaceted approach makes it challenging to provide a comprehensive theoretical explanation. Some of our validation conclusions are derived from applying the method to real-world projects, which includes qualitative verification. For more extensive sensitivity and stability analyses, it is necessary to apply the method to a large number of real-world projects. This broader application would enable a more thorough evaluation of the method's robustness and effectiveness under various practical conditions, providing deeper insights into its performance and potential areas for improvement.

To address this challenge, market-based mechanisms for dynamic carbon emission factors and electricity prices are emerging, particularly in regions like China pursuing carbon neutrality. Buildings, with HVAC systems as the largest consumers, require flexible Demand Response (DR) strategies to balance these fluctuations while maintaining occupant comfort. This paper proposes a hierarchical control framework for building HVAC systems. It optimizes operation for various objectives (minimizing energy consumption, reducing electricity costs, and lowering carbon emissions), while ensuring thermal comfort. The framework involves three modules. First is the time-based demand allocation, which uses genetic algorithms to optimize energy use based on future cooling demands, indoor temperature, and fluctuating electricity and carbon prices. It provides building-level temperature setpoints and electricity consumption plans. Second is the spatial indoor demand adjustment, which balances overall cooling load and temperature satisfaction across individual spaces, taking into account room-specific costs and difficulty confidents for temperature adjustments. This module assigns future temperature setpoints to each space. Third is HVAC system follow-up control, which Implements the optimized setpoints for real-time control of the HVAC system. The framework\u2019s effectiveness is verified through application to a real commercial building project. Compared to a baseline scenario, the optimal electricity cost strategy achieved a 6.5% cost reduction, and the optimal carbon emission reduction strategy achieved an 8.2% reduction. Real-world control based on carbon emission optimization resulted in an actual year-on-year carbon emission reduction of 8.7%.",
