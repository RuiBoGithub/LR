Due to the increasing demands of energy conservation and emission reduction, passive buildings with extra-low energy consumption and near zero energy consumption have attracted more attentions as a promising sustainable building type. Due to passive techniques such as air-tightness, passive buildings have a special demand of mechanical fresh air systems after closing windows. So it is indispensable to explore elaborate control strategies for maximizing natural ventilation, for the purpose of postponing the use of fossil energy. By taking meteorological forecast parameters as the input, an hour-head model-based predictive control (MPC) strategy of natural ventilation was proposed in this paper. Specifically, simulated multi-dimensional datasets obtained by setting different control actions under the same disturbances were obtained as the database for data-driven prediction models, which take weather forecast parameters as the input and labels of thermal comfort levels and air volumes as the output. It has been verified that although both with extended working hours and more stable comfort levels, the MPC strategy with priority to thermal comfort is superior to that with priority to fresh air volume. Furthermore, when compared with the traditional control strategy, ventilation hours via this MPC strategy could be increased by 56.3% from 366 h to 572 h. With this MPC model, the self-adaptive adjustment of window openness could be achieved by taking hour-ahead weather forecasting parameters as the input, thus to facilitate the climatic self-adaptive intelligent operation of passive buildings in future.

Especially, the HVAC system acts as one of the biggest energy consumers and accounts for as large as 50 % of the building energy consumption [3]. Therefore, energy efficiency in buildings has attracted increasing attentions around the world. Under such circumstances, the European Union has announced to achieve a highly energy-efficient building stock by 2050 [4], and the China's 14th Five-Year Plan also calls for an increase of passive buildings, under the background of Carbon Peaking and Carbon Neutrality Goals. As a sustainable building type, the concept of passive building was proposed by Wolfgang Feist in German and Bo Adamson in Sweden [5]. After decades of development, passive buildings with ultra-low energy targets and near-zero energy targets have become one of the most crucial energy-saving building types in recent years [6\u20137]. By making good use of sufficient passive techniques and renewable energy, the passive building is designed to be adapted to climatic characteristics and site conditions, while providing a comfortable indoor environment with minimum fossil energy. Especially, due to the particular climatic characteristics, passive buildings in China are established to abide by the principle of \u201cPassive Priority, Active Optimization\u201d, which means passive technologies of favorable envelope structures and air impermeability are firstly improved to reduce heating and cooling demands, followed by active energy technologies with optimized efficiency and sufficient utilization of renewable energy [8]. However, current studies mainly focus on the optimal design and assessment of passive buildings, while the operation-related fundamental and application studies are still limited. This is determined by the complex and dynamic operation principles of coupled passive and active techniques, as well as the demands of multi-dimensional data when faced with problems of optimal operation strategies. On the one hand, as the final link of building energy efficiency, it should be emphasized that the constraint indicators in terms of energy consumption be guaranteed during the operation stage. On the other hand, under the background of carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals, the carbon emission at operation stage has been verified to be the top with the largest proportion. For example, the energy consumption during building operation is 963 million tons of standard coal, accounting for about 21 % of the total energy consumption in China [9]. In addition, due to the enhanced passive techniques such as heat preservation and air impermeability, both the load features and indoor thermal responding principles are different from those of traditional buildings. Consequently, it is quite important to achieve the flexible and elaborate operation of different systems oriented for maintaining indoor thermal comfort in passive buildings. Among various techniques during the operation stage, natural ventilation serves as one of the most important passive techniques for improving the indoor thermal environment without extra energy consumption. So it has been highly recommended in different standards and studies for passive buildings [10\u201312]. However, there are still some issues when considering the local climatic conditions and special thermal features of ultra-low energy and near-zero energy buildings: \u2022 The effect of natural ventilation is significantly influenced by local meteorological conditions [13\u201315], which usually show cyclical and dynamic fluctuation features. So the control of natural ventilation is a nonlinear complicated problem related to multi-dimensional parameters. \u2022 For most regions in China, besides natural ventilation, HVAC systems are usually necessary for both heating and cooling demands. At the same time, strict constraints of energy consumption put up to the sufficient use of renewable energy as well as the timely control of multi-energy systems. So it is quite important to take good advantage of natural ventilation, which is also an application form of renewable energy, until it is necessary to switch to mechanical HVAC systems. So for natural ventilation in passive buildings, it should be explored that how the natural ventilation can be used elaborately, under circumstances of the dynamic climate conditions. \u2022 Due to the enhanced passive techniques, the indoor thermal environment usually shows features of large lags and inertia with different indoor temperature waves. So the effect of natural ventilation in passive buildings could also be influenced by such thermal features. Consequently, it can be concluded that the flexible regulation of natural ventilation based on dynamic meteorological parameters and special thermal features are crucial for the final energy conservation at operation stage. As for passive buildings with special requirements of sufficient fresh air due to its strict air tightness of N50 ≤ 0.6 [10], the elaborate control of natural ventilation should be studied further based on current theories and models [16]. 1.2 Control strategies of natural ventilation in buildings By making use of the wind pressure and the thermal pressure resulting from temperature differences and height differences, the natural ventilation introduces outdoor fresh air to exchange heat and moisture with the indoor air, with the purpose of improving indoor thermal comfort without consuming extra fossil energy. In order to realize a better performance, the natural ventilation in buildings is usually designed to be enhanced by structures of atriums and skylights etc. The effect of natural ventilation in buildings has been tested in many studies. Considering both air quality and thermal comfort, Ji et al [17] analyzed the potential of natural ventilation in 74 cities, which are mostly located in coastal areas covering five climate regions in China. It was concluded that for cold regions, the natural ventilation was suitable for as long as nearly 40 % hours of the whole year. It was also pointed out that the effect of natural ventilation in coastal areas is better than that of inland areas [18]. In terms of its cooling effect, some studies in United States and in Europe have found that natural ventilation can reduce energy consumption resulting from cooling by 40\u201350 % [19\u201321]. In addition, based on the analysis of natural ventilation in 100 cities in China, it was concluded by Li et al [22] that in particular seasons, natural ventilation can meet 60\u2013100 % of the cooling demand, and it shows great potential in reducing building energy consumption at the operation stage in summer. However, due to the indeterminacy of indoor and outdoor environments, it is also found that during the manual control of natural ventilation, windows are usually determined to be closed only after people feel uncomfortable or when indoor thermal parameters exceed constraints. Instead of building comfort thermal environment, this kind of hysteretic control could even deteriorate the indoor thermal environment on the contrary by introducing more heating or cooling loads, which need to be handled by mechanical HVAC systems with extra energy consumption [19]. 1.2.1 Current control strategies types of natural ventilation In order to make use of the outdoor fresh air efficiently, the elaborate control of natural ventilation has gained more attentions nowadays. In some commercial and residential buildings, there are already some electric window openers driven by different control strategies. Based on control targets and adopted methods, current control strategies of natural ventilation can be classified into four types as follows: \u2022 Type I takes dates as the condition for opening or closing windows, without adjustments during the function period. As illustrated by Bay et al [23], taking a building in a hot and humid climate zone as the case study, the function period was achieved based on building occupancy, local cooling schedules and monitored meteorological data. This type is easily to be realized but the indoor thermal comfort level could largely fluctuate along with the outdoor changing parameters. \u2022 Type II is improved from Type I by taking the combination of date and hour ID as function conditions, but still without adjustment during the action periods. For instance, three frames of natural ventilation, including Daytime Ventilation, Full-day Ventilation and Night Ventilation, were proposed by Kyritsi et al [24] based on hour-level analysis. This control strategy is more refined when compared with Type I, but it is still difficult to cope with sudden changes of outdoor weather. \u2022 Type III is proposed by setting threshold values of indoor and outdoor temperatures or temperature differences. When the monitored temperature exceeds the threshold, it is determined that the comfort thermal environment cannot be achieved via natural ventilation, so the windows are closed. For example, by setting the threshold of indoor-outdoor temperature difference as 3℃ in the premise that the indoor temperature is higher than the thermostat set-point temperature of 26℃, the natural ventilation was simulated in six climate zones in Italy, and results showed that the building energy consumption could be reduced by 18.6 %-78.8 % in different climate zones [25]. This control type can respond to sudden meteorological changes, but the indoor temperature will inevitably remain to be exceeded for a period after actions due to the lag of the thermal environment changes, let alone the ignored thermal comfort indicators. \u2022 In order to avoid the hysteretic phenomenon of Type III, Type IV is oriented to realize pre-control by using various prediction models, which can be categorized into white-box model, gray-box model and black-box model [26]. Based on the white-box model established via EnergyPlus, the indoor air dry bulb temperature and boundary conditions of natural ventilation were predicted by Guo et al [27] to optimize the passive ventilation in subtropical regions. Results showed that the indoor thermal comfort was improved effectively with stronger thermal endurance. The gray-box model, such as an RC-network model, can also be used to predict the indoor CO2 concentrations, which were then used to estimate the ventilation air change rate [28]. In addition, along with the development of data mining technologies, data-driven prediction models, which can be attributed to black-box models such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) model, have been increasingly applied in this field [29\u201330]. In addition, by taking indoor and outdoor real-time parameters as the input, this control type with black-box models can respond to sudden changes in time, take good advantage of thermal inertia, and it has showed great potential in areas of optimal control and operation. 1.2.2 Current data-driven control of natural ventilation The data-driven control based on predictions is defined as a kind of model-based predictive control (MPC), which is a key research direction in the field of automatic control since firstly proposed by Richalet et al in 1970 s [31\u201332]. As shown in Fig. 1 , unlike the simple feedback loop in traditional control methods, the MPC method, which includes links of establishment of prediction models, feedback correction, and rolling optimization etc., decides the optimal control action in a future moment based on systematic mathematic models and predicted disturbances [33]. By hour-ahead actions, this control method can be attributed to feed-forward control, instead of the traditional feedback control. In this way, the disadvantage of hysteretic environmental responses resulted from traditional feedback control methods can be avoided. Currently, studies related to data-driven MPC mainly focus on the establishment of controllers and problem solving. Considering that the curse of dimensionality cannot be avoided in traditional well-used dynamic programming equations, and Euler equations are only applicable for certain initial conditions without responses, MPC models have been increasingly applied in areas of the optimal control of different HVAC systems related to the indoor thermal environment [34\u201335], as shown in Table 1 . Firstly, it can be seen from Table 1 that different machine learning algorithms have been applied in this field, such as reinforce learning in [41], multi-layer perceptron network in [44], neural network in [45] and decision tree with clustering in [47]. When compared with models based on traditional data-driven algorithms, models based on machine learning can facilitate the rolling optimization and realize the optimal feed-forward control with multi-objective functions. For example, as one of the most used machine learning algorithms [48], the neural network was applied in [49] to balance targets of indoor thermal comfort and energy consumption. In addition, as shown in Table 1, MPC control based on machine learning can be conducted with shorter intervals. However, it can also be seen from Table 1 that current controls based on MPC are mostly established for HVAC systems by taking indoor temperature or balancing the energy consumption and thermal comfort as the targets [50]. While for natural ventilation focused in this paper, related MPC control studies are still rare, mainly due to the quickly changeable outside meteorological disturbances with direct and nonlinear influences on the indoor thermal environment. For natural ventilation via MPC strategy, indoor thermal comfort should be taken as the crucial target instead of indoor temperature, in order to maximize the renewable ventilation and thus to postpone energy consumption from fossil fuels. This is especially important for passive buildings, because after closing windows, the fresh air system should be opened in time due to the strict air tightness. However, such elaborate control of window openness by taking hour-ahead weather prediction parameters as the input is rarely discussed in previous papers. Moreover, both the complex nonlinear relationship with outdoor disturbances and the demands of large datasets add up to the difficulties of hour-ahead or day-ahead feed-forward control of natural ventilation. Consequently, focused on the special demand of maximum utilization of natural ventilation in passive buildings, this paper aims to explore an hour-ahead MPC strategy based on data-driven predictions of indoor thermal comfort and air volume by taking the outdoor meteorological forecast parameters as the input, on the premise that the outside air quality can be guaranteed during ventilation. 2 Methodology 2.1 Methodology overview In order to achieve the hour-ahead intelligent control of natural ventilation, methods of field measurements, physical simulation and machine learning algorithms are combined systematically into a hybrid model as shown in Fig. 2 . Functions of involved methods are clarified as follows: \u2022 Field measurements were conducted to collect outdoor and indoor multi-dimensional parameters, so as to extract the basic principles of natural ventilation and to provide baselines for the calibration of physical simulations. In addition, the real-time hourly meteorological parameters for a whole year were collected from the Weather Underground website [51] for further physical simulation and the pre-screening via data-driven seasonal division. \u2022 Physical simulation was established via EnergyPlus based on the information and data resulted from on-site investigation & survey and hourly meteorological parameters. After being calibrated via measured data, the simulated results of multi-dimensional datasets, which were obtained by setting different control actions under the same inner and outer disturbances, can be obtained as the database for the following data-driven prediction modeling and comparisons. \u2022 In order to initially filter days apparently not appropriate for natural ventilation, the Gaussian Mixed Model (GMM) algorithm was performed based on meteorological parameters to achieve the data-driven transition seasonal division, instead of the traditional transition season decided directly by dates. \u2022 In this MPC control framework, not only the indoor thermal comfort should be taken as the control target, but also the air change rate should be guaranteed as a special technical indicator of passive buildings [10]. Thus, data-driven prediction models of thermal comfort and air volume of natural ventilation were established respectively by support vector machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), based on the database resulted from simulations. Afterwards, the MPC control strategy could be established with these two controlled targets of thermal comfort and air volumes, as shown in Fig. 2. 2.2 Case study building and field measurements 2.2.1 Case study building and natural ventilation condition As one of the most important areas suitable for passive buildings, the cold region has an occupied proportion of 60 % of passive buildings with both heating and cooling demands. In this paper, a passive office building in Zhengzhou, which is a typical city in cold region in China, is taken as the case study building. This building has been operated for three years since 2019. As shown in Fig. 3 , this is a three-story multi-functional office building with a total floor area of 1561.9 m2 and a shape factor of 0.3. The window-wall ratios are designed as 0.16 in east, 0.19 in west, 0.43 in south and 0.13 in north respectively, as well as the attached sun shadings outside the windows in south, east and west. For the purpose of extra-low energy consumption, the natural ventilation was designed to be enhanced via an atrium with an openable skylight, which is 8.1 m long and 7.25 m wide in the form of a fiberglass frame and a three-glass two-cavity hollow structure. In this way, the natural ventilation could be realized under the combined effects of wind pressure and enhanced thermal pressure resulted from the chimney effect with the atrium space and skylight, as shown in Fig. 3. In addition, this building is located in the flat plains without surrounding rows of buildings, and it is oriented mainly north\u2013south with a small angle of wind projection. Considering that the dominant wind direction in Zhengzhou city is southeast in the spring, it can be concluded that all these conditions are conducive to the natural ventilation application. Especially, with thermal performance parameters of envelopes summarized in Table 2 and other parameters regarding HVAC systems, both the simulated heating demand of 14 kWh/(m2\u2022a) in winter and cooling and dehumidification demands of 16 kWh/(m2\u2022a) in summer can meet the certification standards of passive buildings by Passive House Institute (PHI) in Germany [52]. 2.2.2 Field measurement settings As shown in Fig. 3, the meeting room, the office room and the atrium are taken as the measurement targets. During the testing, internal doors of office room and meeting room on the other side were closed most of the time. According to Indoor Thermal and Humid Environment Evaluation Standard for Civil Buildings [53], indoor measurement points were arranged in three measured rooms as shown in Fig. 4 . In particular, five points were arranged horizontally at the height of 1.1 m away from the ground, and points 6 & 7 were arranged in the same vertical direction as point 1 at distances of 0.1 m and 1.6 m away from the ground respectively. Every 30 min, measured parameters of indoor air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, black-bulb temperature were recorded by meters as shown in the Table 3 from 8:00 to 18:00 per day. 2.3 Physical modeling for multi-conditional database 2.3.1 Basic settings The physical model was established based on EnergyPlus and SketchUp. According to the orientation, envelope features and room functions, six thermal zones with green boxes framed are divided as shown in Fig. 3. Specifically, there are two thermal zones located on the first floor respectively in south and in north, and there are three thermal zones on the second floor with functions of meeting, office, and receptions. Besides, all the open space and the atrium are grouped into the sixth thermal zone. Afterwards, the physical thermal parameters of envelopes in Table 2 were modified in Material Module and then assigned to different parts of envelopes in Construction Module in EnergyPlus. Referring to onsite surveys, the personnel density is assigned as 15 m2/P, the equipment energy density is assessed as 13 W/m2, the equipment utilization rate is 32.7 %, and the lighting energy density is 9 W/m2. In addition, all the internal heat gains including equipment and occupancy are set via schedules to be constant during the operation time from 8:00 to 18:00, in keeping with the practical operation schedules of the case study building. 2.3.2 Meteorological settings The default weather file in EnergyPlus is the historical meteorological data in 2005 of Zhengzhou City. In order to make the simulation results better reflect the actual operation effect followed by an effective modeling calibration of the physical model, the default weather file was replaced by the recorded practical meteorological datasets of the testing year downloaded from the Weather Underground website, including practical hourly sequences of dry-bulb temperature, relative humidity, wind velocity and wind direction, which can be regarded as the most related meteorological parameters with natural ventilation. As shown in Fig. 5 , it can be concluded that the differences of temperatures and relative humidity between the default and the tested are considerable, so it is necessary to update the meteorological files. 2.3.3 Natural ventilation settings The natural ventilation was simulated in EnergyPlus via a module named Wind and Stack Open Area, which can simulate natural ventilation effect under changeable outside meteorological parameters based on calculations of thermal pressure and wind pressure in thermal zones with the indoor and outdoor parameters. In this model, the input parameters include window area and the corresponding opening degree. The window area is the sum of all openable windows in a certain thermal zone, and the opening degree, which is controlled by corresponding schedules, could be set from 0 to 1 representing closed and fully opened respectively. As another controlled target, the total ventilation quantity of natural ventilation Qnv is calculated as shown in Eq. (1) [54]: (1) Q nv = Q w 2 + Q s 2 Q w = C w × S oa × λ s × v w Q s = C d × S oa × λ s × 2 g h t i - t o t i where Qw is the natural ventilation quantity under wind pressures, Qs is the natural ventilation quantity under thermal pressures, Cw is the flow coefficient under wind pressures, Soa is the openable window area, λ s is the opening degree controlled by schedules, vw is the outdoor air velocity near windows, Cd is the flow coefficient under thermal pressures, ti is the indoor air temperature, to is the outdoor air temperature. 2.3.4 Clothing settings In the thermal comfort assessment based on human body heat balance equation, such as the predicted mean vote (PMV) and predicted percentage of dissatisfied (PPD) proposed by Fanger [55\u201356], the parameter of clothing insulation has a large impact on results. In order to better reflect the dress features under different seasons, the typical clothing habit was defined respectively for each section resulted from the clustering results in section 2.4.1. Particularly, the clothing insulation in the low-temperature cluster is calculated as 0.96 clo representing \u201clong pants + long-sleeved shirt + suit top + socks + shoes + underwear\u201d, the clothing insulation in the high-temperature cluster is calculated as 0.54 representing \u201cthin pants + short-sleeved shirt + socks + shoes + underwear\u201d, and the clothing insulation in the transitional season cluster is taken as 0.74 representing \u201clong pants + long-sleeved shirt + socks + shoes + underwear\u201d. In addition, the values of clothing insulations in predictive algorithms are also assigned based on the clustering results. 2.4 Data-driven modeling of thermal comfort and predictive control As shown in Fig. 2, data-driven modeling in this paper consists of three parts: GMM-based seasonal division model based on measured meteorological parameters (section 2.4.1), SVM-based prediction model of indoor thermal comfort based on the simulated database resulted from physical modeling results (section 2.4.2) and BPNN-based prediction model of air change volume based on the simulated database (section 2.4.3). 2.4.1 GMM-based seasonal division model Traditional seasonal division is decided according to the sliding mean temperature T M ¯ j of the jth day as shown in Eq. (2), and transition seasons of spring and autumn are labeled when the T M ¯ j is calculated into the range of [10℃, 22℃] [57]. (2) T M ¯ j = t j - 4 + t j - 3 + t j - 2 + t j - 1 + t j 5 where tj is the average temperature of the jth day. On the one hand, this division standard is proposed by mainly considering agricultural applications with a relatively low upper limit temperature of 22℃. However, when considering natural ventilation, it is pointed out in Technical Standard for Nearly Zero Energy Buildings [10] that it is encouraged to use natural ventilation when the outdoor temperature is lower than 28 ℃, which is much higher than the division point of 22℃. On the other hand, this sliding mean temperature T M ¯ j could be largely influenced by ambient four days ahead, so this indicator is not applicable for natural ventilation, which asks for strong timeliness of controls. Actually, there are no well-accepted season divisions when considering the application of natural ventilation. This may not be a big issue for traditional buildings. However, for passive buildings, because of the strict standard of air-tightness, extra fresh air should be immediately guaranteed via mechanical fresh air system after closing windows. So it is indispensable to pursue the maximum potential of natural ventilation for passive buildings. In face of this situation, considering the fact that people would change clothes mainly according to the outside temperature, the data-driven clustering based on datasets of 8760 h for a whole year was made in this paper firstly, in order to provide references for deciding different typical clothing habits corresponding to the outside temperature levels as shown in section 2.3.4. Specifically, the non-supervised Gaussian-Mixed-Model (GMM) algorithm, which is constructed by the linear combination among multiple Gaussian distribution functions, was adopted in this paper to achieve three temperature levels, serving as the basis of clothing assignments. When compared with the basic K-means clustering algorithm, main advantages of GMM can be summarized as follows [58]: \u2022 K-means is only applicable for circular or spherical distributed samples. In addition to this, GMM also give good performance when dealing with elliptical distributed samples. \u2022 By considering weighs of different clusters, GMM can handle the unbalanced samples as well. \u2022 As a generated model with strong interpretability, the clustering results obtained in GMM are extracted according to the united probability distribution of samples. While for k-means algorithm as a kind of discrimination model, the results are obtained by hard division with 0 or 1 in sample space, leading to the poor interpretability when faced with practical problems. The main construction of GMM is shown in Eq. (3) [59]. (3) p x = ∑ k = 1 K π k N x | μ k , Σ k where N x | μ k , Σ k is the component in the model, π k is the mixing factor, k is the number of clusters, and π k can be understood as the weight of each component. When using this method to build clusters, π k is actually the probability of the selected component. Firstly, the GMM algorithm is conducted by randomly estimating values of μ , π , and Σ , based on which the attached probabilities are calculated followed by the initial k clusters. This is called the \u201cE\u201d step. Afterwards, the \u201cM\u201d step is carried out to calculate new values of μ , π , and Σ based on the obtained clusters from the last E step. In this way, the final clustering results can be achieved by cycling the E step and M step until reach the convergency values. During actual applications, the initial values of μ , π , and Σ are usually decided based on the results of K-means algorithm via M step, and this can largely improve the calculation efficiency. Considering related parameters for dividing seasons oriented for natural ventilation, the outdoor dry bulb temperature and outdoor relative humidity are taken as the input for GMM. In addition, the number of clusters k is decided as 3, in order to distinguish 3 typical temperature levels respectively corresponding to winter season, transition season and summer season. 2.4.2 SVM-based prediction model of indoor thermal comfort During the calculation of indoor thermal comfort indicators such as PMV, the input parameters include indoor status parameters and indoor human-related parameters. So it can neither provide a predicted thermal comfort level based on weather forecast, nor serve as a criterion for the MPC strategy of natural ventilation. To tackle this issue, the data-driven prediction model taking weather forecast parameters as the input and labels of thermal comfort levels as the output is established in this section, based on the database resulted from physical simulations. When selecting applicable machine learning algorithms, the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC curve), each point in which represents the predicted effectiveness of different algorithms with the same input, was taken to make primary election among different algorithms [60]. In particular, the larger area between ROC curves and the line of y = x is enclosed, the more applicable this algorithm is. Taking outdoor temperature, relative humidity, air velocity and clothing insulations as the input, the ROC curves of five well-used algorithms are constructed and compared via Python in Fig. 6 . The selection of input parameters is determined by considering the access to weather forecast and the ventilation principles. Firstly, it can be seen that k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) has the best prediction performances. However, the training set in KNN needs to be saved additionally, so it is inconvenient for the following iterative optimization process. Secondly, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) have similar good prediction performance only a little lower than KNN. Considering that when dealing with classification prediction such as the indoor thermal comfort level, SVM is more applicable rather than quantitative prediction via ANN. As a result, algorithms of SVM and ANN are adopted respectively for the prediction of indoor thermal comfort in this section and the prediction of air volume in section 2.4.3. As for the prediction of indoor thermal comfort in this section, SVM is a linear partition looking for the maximum interval in the idiosyncratic space, and it can be combined with kernel functions to map the initial datasets into a high-dimensional space, in order to achieve nonlinear classification. The standard form of the algorithm is shown in Eq. (4) [61]. (4) y = f x = ω φ x + b where the coefficients of ω and b are determined by the minimum equation (5) [60]: (5) R SVM c = 1 2 ω 2 + c 1 n ∑ i = 1 n L ε d i , ω φ x i + b where 1 2 ω 2 is the regularization term, c 1 n ∑ i = 1 n L ε d i , ω φ x + b is the empirical risk formula: (6) R SVM ω , ξ ∗ = 1 2 ω 2 + c ∑ i = 1 n ξ i + ξ i ∗ (7) ω φ x i + b i - d i ≤ ε + ξ i ∗ , ξ i ∗ ≥ 0 d i - ω φ x i - b i ≤ ε + ξ i , ξ i ≥ 0 Finally, with the introduction of Lagrange multipliers, the decision function given by Eq. (4) can be transformed into the following exact form: (8) f x , α i , α i ∗ = ∑ i = 1 n α i - α i ∗ K x , x i + b When carrying out the prediction via SVM, the process of parameter adjustment is very important. Firstly, the selection of kernel function was carried out by comparisons of predicted accuracy among SVM models based on different kernel functions, as shown in Fig. 7 . With the highest prediction accuracy, the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel function was adopted. Secondly, it is known that a bigger value of Kernel function coefficient \u201cgamma\u201d leads to a more delicate classification, yet it could also result in over-fitting without continuous interfaces. Regarding parameters of penalty coefficient C and \u201cgamma\u201d, crossover experiments were conducted as shown in the heat map of Fig. 8 , in order to quickly find the optimal combination of these two coefficients. Based on the right color bar, it can be seen that the lighter the color, the more prediction accuracy under a certain combination of C and gamma. Consequently, it can be concluded that the combination of 10 (C) and 0.01 (gamma) corresponding to the lightest color lump should be taken with the optimal prediction accuracy higher than 0.85. 2.4.3 BPNN-based prediction model of air volume For natural ventilation in passive buildings, the air volume should also be guaranteed while pursuing indoor thermal comfort. As compared in section 2.4.2, the Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) algorithm, which is a well-used forward neural network, is adopted for predicting the air volume. BPNN is composed of two processes: the forward propagation of learning signals, and the back propagation of errors. Due to the process of back propagation, the errors could be reversely propagated from the output in order to adjust the training network weights and threshold values of each layer. When using BPNN for prediction, the goal is to derive n output parameters from m input parameters. According to the principle of natural ventilation, the ventilated air volume depends on temperature difference, wind pressure and height difference. As a result, input parameters of this data-driven prediction model are determined as outdoor dry bulb temperature, outdoor wind speed and wind direction. According to the principles of BPNN, the output value of each node is achieved based on the output values of all nodes in the upper layer, the weights of the current node and all nodes in the upper layer, as well as the threshold value of current node and the activation function, which is selected as sigmoid functions as shown in Eq. (9)-(10) [48\u201349]: (9) S j = ∑ i = 0 m - 1 w ij x i + b j x j = s i g m o i d S j s i g m o i d x = 1 1 + e - x (10) Y = f ∑ j = 1 n w j x j - b where w ij is the weight from input layer to hidden layer, x i is the input sequence of the input layer, b j is the threshold value of the hidden layer, x j is the input sequence of the hidden layer, Y is the output, w j is the weight from hidden layers to input layers, b is the threshold value of the output layer and it is usually assigned as 0 for BPNN algorithm. Furthermore, when carrying out the calculation via BPNN, parameters of different learning rates and training numbers are tested as shown in Fig. 9 . It can be seen that the rate of convergence at a learning rate of 0.001 is fast, while the error after convergence is bigger than that at a learning rate of 0.006. In addition, it can be seen that the convergence can normally be reached after iterating for more than 80,000 times. In summary, the learning rate and training number are decided respectively as 0.006 and 80,000. 2.5 Calculation of indoor thermal comfort As indicated in section 2.3.4, most of current assessments regarding indoor thermal comfort were carried out based on Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) and Predicted Percent Dissatisfied (PPD) [12,55], which are only applicable for heated and cooled buildings, instead of unsteady natural ventilation. It has been testified that the thermal comfort level predicted by PMV is usually hotter than that of the actual thermal sensation [56,62]. In order to have a better assessment of the thermal sensation for thermal environment in free-running buildings, some amendatory indicators have been proposed based on PMV. Among these indicators, the adaptive predicted mean vote (APMV) is well used for assessing the thermal environment under natural ventilation. APMV is proposed by black-box modeling the relationship between PMV models and the actual thermal sensations as shown in Eq. (11) [63]. Since its proposal, this indicator has already been applied in some assessments [64\u201365]. (11) APMV = PMV 1 + λ P M V where λ is the adaptive coefficient related to human behaviors and psychological expectation degrees, which can be reflected by building types and the located climatic regions as shown in Table 4 [66]. As a black-box model to add the effect of adaptive opportunities of the thermal environment on thermal sensation (added to PMV prediction), the adaptive coefficients in Table 4 were extracted based on 3621 questionnaire surveys together with testing [63], the process of which could also be conducted in other regions to obtain corresponding adaptive coefficients. In this paper, the APMV indicator is adopted to assess the thermal comfort of natural ventilation and the adaptive coefficients are determined referring to those of cold region in Table 4. 3 Results 3.1 Results of field measurements Scatters of indoor and outdoor temperatures during the test period from April 6 to April 10 were summarized in Fig. 10 . During the period of natural ventilation from April 6 to April 8 as shown in Fig. 10(a), the outdoor temperatures were mainly concentrated between 20℃ and 26℃, and the indoor temperatures of three typical rooms were changing between 18℃and 22℃. In addition, the indoor temperature in the atrium is lower and it is closer to the outdoor temperature than those of the other two rooms, because of the enhanced natural ventilation resulted from chimney effect. Furthermore, due to the good envelope performance of the ultra-low energy building, when the outdoor temperature was reduced into from April 9 to April 10, the windows were closed, and the indoor temperatures of canonical rooms still remain at a fine range of 16-21℃ as shown in Fig. 10(b). During the test period, the indoor APMV values, which mainly fall into the range between −1 and 0.25, are shown in Fig. 11 . Firstly, it can be seen that the office room has a smaller APMV level, because of the larger indoor air velocity resulted from cross ventilation when the inner door is opened to the atrium. Secondly, during the period of natural ventilation, the indoor APMVs of the meeting room and the atrium were basically greater than −0.5, which means 90 % of the personnel thermal comfort requirements can be satisfied. While when the windows were closed, the indoor APMVs could also be basically maintained above −1, which means 75 % of the personnel thermal comfort requirements can be satisfied. Last but not the least, it can be concluded from Fig. 11 that when conducting natural ventilation only based on schedules without adjusting, most of the APMVs in the mornings and evenings exceeded the comfort zone, showing slightly cold. Therefore, the elaborate control and regulation of natural ventilation with smaller intervals is very necessary. 3.2 Calibrations of physical and data-driven modeling 3.2.1 Physical modeling calibration The measured and simulated indoor temperatures of the office room and the corresponding thermal zone were selected for comparisons, as shown in Fig. 12 (a)(b)(c). It can be seen that the simulated results have relatively gentle temperature changes, with large differences from the measured values only at points of sudden changes. The mean bias error (MBE) is calculated as 3.12 % and the coefficient of variation of the root-mean-square error (CV (RMSE)) is 4.14 %. Besides, the R2 test was performed as well as the correlation analysis between measured and simulated temperatures, as shown in 12(d). With a R2 of 0.81123, it can be concluded that the physical model can reflect the actual situation. 3.2.2 Data-driven modeling calibration Firstly, when making calibrations for SVM model, the dataset was divided into two parts: the training set with 2962 data points occupying for 80 %, and the test set with 593 data points occupying for 20 %. Taking the openness of 0.5 as an example, the calibration results are summarized in Table 5 . It can be seen that in training set, the number of samples conforming to \u201ccomfort\u201d in prediction and \u201ccomfort\u201d in measurement is 464. Thus, it can be concluded that the accuracy rates in training set and in test set are assessed as 0.9408 and 0.9178 respectively. Afterwards, the air volumes in transition season calculated by the physical model were used as the training set, and 300 of them are randomly selected as the test dataset, the calibration results of BPNN based on which are given in Fig. 13 . With a high R2 of 0.918, it can be concluded that this data-driven prediction model of ventilation air volume gives satisfied performance, thus providing good foundations for the subsequent control strategy. 3.3 Data-driven seasonal division under meteorological parameters After training with GMM model, the division results based on hourly meteorological parameters in Zhengzhou City are summarized in Fig. 14 , in which the transition season is labeled as category 2 filled in green patches. As a result, the transition season can be settled briefly into two periods: the spring transitional season from March 9 to May 20, and the autumn transitional season from September 11 to November 17. The following exploration of natural ventilation control is conducted based on division results of category 2. In order to have a better understanding of these two divided transitional seasons, the distribution analysis based on outdoor temperatures is given in Fig. 15 . Firstly, the main temperature range with 14\u201326 °C of the spring season is a little higher than that of the autumn season with 12\u201324 °C. Furthermore, according to the temperatures corresponding to cumulative probabilities of 50 % and 90 %, it is obvious that the outdoor temperature in autumn changes more smoothly, rather than the significant fluctuations in spring. On the whole, the number of hours exceeding 28℃ in transitional season is relatively small, which means this data-driven division is suitable for natural ventilation with good potentials. 3.4 Results of window open/close predictive control 3.4.1 Formulation of window open/close predictive control strategy Based on the SVM prediction model established in section 2.4.2, the hour-ahead control taking meteorological parameters etc. as the input was conducted to maintain the steady indoor thermal environment. The mapping in this MPC model was established between input parameters and the corresponding simulated APMV indicators resulted from physical simulations. In order to have a better understanding of strategies based on MPC results, an example is presented as follows by taking the opening level of windows as 0.5. The training results of physical simulation at the opening level of 0.5 were drawn in Fig. 16 , in which the green area represents conditions suitable for natural ventilation, and the blue area means the windows should be closed due to the uncomfortable feelings. It can be concluded that the outdoor temperatures suitable for natural ventilation at the opening of 0.5 mainly located from 22℃ to 30 ℃. In addition, the boundaries of outdoor temperatures suitable for natural ventilation could increase when the relative humidity is lower than 40 %. Furthermore, it can be seen that when the outdoor temperature is around 27℃, the indoor thermal environment shows green \u201ccomfort\u201d level no matter what the relative humidity is. This is determined by the insensitive of relative humidity in the calculation of APMV indicators. In a similar way, all comfort zones based on the same input but at different opening rates of window can be obtained for further references of ventilation strategies established in section 3.5. 3.4.2 Validation of open/close predictive control In order to test the effectiveness of open/close control via MPC, simulated results based on predicted open/close schedules in Fig. 16 were compared with those at a fixed opening degree of 0.5. Taking April 20th as an example, the hourly outdoor temperatures, relative humidity and wind velocity are summarized in Fig. 17 as a typical transition day with relative large changing ranges regarding meteorological parameters. Due to the MPC predicted results, it is recommended that the windows should be opened for natural ventilation only after 12:00. After simulation, results regarding indoor temperature and APMV are compared in Fig. 18 . It can be concluded that the indoor temperature with open/close MPC control tends to be more steady, and the AMPVs with MPC are closer to the thermal neutrality zone. Especially, the indoor thermal comfort was improved from \u201ccool\u201d to \u201ccomfort\u201d from 10:00 to 12:00 by closing the windows totally. Although the comfortable period can be extended for two hours by open/close predictive control, it should also be noted that for passive buildings, the mechanical fresh air system should be opened immediately after closing windows. This inevitably adds up to energy consumption. 3.5 Results of window openness predictive control 3.5.1 Formulation of window openness predictive control strategy It can be concluded that the open/close MPC strategy presented in section 3.4 is still limited, because when the indoor thermal comfort cannot be guaranteed during 10:00\u201312:00 on April 20th, it is better to adjust the opening degrees instead of closing windows directly, so as to postpone the usage of fossil fuels while maintaining the indoor thermal comfort. It can be concluded from section 3.4.1 that the acceptable ranges of outdoor temperatures for natural ventilation are different corresponding to different opening degrees. Consequently, with the SVM prediction model, a flowchart of openness MPC strategy was given in Fig. 19 . Firstly, based on the multi-dimensional simulated database at different opening degrees, the data-driven prediction models of APMVs are established. Secondly, when faced with a certain input sequence, APMVs under different opening degrees with an interval of 0.1 are calculated in a circular manner, until the proper opening degrees corresponding to indoor thermal \u201ccomfort\u201d are settled. Thirdly, besides the extra check of fresh air volume via calculated ventilation volumes, when there are more than one opening degree contributing to comfort feelings, the indicator of ventilation volume is also taken as an extra criterion. Especially, if all the opening degrees lead to uncomfortable thermal feelings, it can be concluded that the natural ventilation is not applicable anymore under this circumstance, and it should turn to mechanical ventilation with artificial heat or cold sources instead. With this flowchart, real-time meteorological predicted parameters etc. are taken as the input sequence of data-driven prediction models, and the indoor thermal comfort level of the next hour APMVt+1(a) can be calculated as the output, based on which the actions of opening windows at a certain degree or opening mechanical ventilation systems after closing windows could be decided. Specifically, if the indoor thermal comfort APMVt+1(a) at the opening degree (a) could be satisfied, the natural ventilation volume NVMt+1(a) is predicted and checked: when NVVt+1(a) is larger than the lowest fresh air demand VVmin , the natural ventilation is adopted in the next hour, otherwise turns to the mechanical ventilation. 3.5.2 Validation of openness prediction control During the validation, hourly recommended opening degrees of windows, which were calculated based on input sequences with measured meteorological parameters, were written into the schedule in EnergyPlus for simulation. Taking April 20th as an example, as shown in Fig. 20 , the suitable period of natural ventilation lasts for 8 h from 12:00 to 18:00, when taking open/close control (O/C control represented by green lines and green dots) as the strategy. While for the openness control considering comfort proposed in section 3.5.1, the suitable period was extended to 10 h from 10:00 to 18:00. In addition to the increased ventilation hours with free energy, as shown in Fig. 20, it can be seen that the thermal comfort level (red dots) of the proposed openness control is closer to the line of thermal neutrality (APMV = 0), when compared with the green dots representing the indoor thermal comfort level under O/C control. Consequently, it can be concluded that no matter for the extended ventilation hours or the improved thermal comfort level, this proposed MPC openness control strategy is superior to the traditional O/C control strategy. In particular, the opening degrees corresponding to 10:00 and 11:00 are settled as 0.1 and 0.1 respectively. At these two opening degrees, the ventilation quantity of air exchange is calculated via BPNN models respectively to be 763.44 m3/h and 821.99 m3/h, which are both larger than the required fresh air volume of 600 m3/h for the case study room. Especially, when calculating the appropriate opening degrees in a circular manner for all the divided transitional days shown in Fig. 14, it is found that in some circumstances, there might be more than one opening degrees corresponding to the comfortable thermal feelings. Consequently, two control logics with priorities respectively to maximizing the fresh air volume and to the most comfortable thermal environment are also compared in Fig. 20. Firstly, it can be concluded that both these two strategies can improve the indoor comfort and enlarge the appropriate hours of natural ventilation, when compared with those of the open/closed strategy. Moreover, it can be seen that the indoor thermal environment under strategy with priority to thermal comfort tends to be closer to the thermal neutrality, while the indoor thermal comfort level under strategy with priority to fresh air volume is slightly lower than that of open/close strategy on the contrary. In other words, the MPC strategy with priority to thermal comfort is more satisfied. Finally, for the transition season divided in section 3.3, it can be calculated that with this MPC strategy, the suitable hours for natural ventilation are increased by 56.3 %, from 366 h via the traditional control method with a fixed openness of 0.5 without adjustments to the improved 572 h via MPC of openness. 4 Discussion 4.1 Application patterns and scopes MPC is a model-based closed-loop optimal control strategy. The purpose of the control strategy established in this paper is realizing the quantitative control of unsteady natural ventilation, by hour-ahead predicting the indoor thermal status based on weather forecasting parameters. When applying this strategy shown in Fig. 19, it can be concluded as three parts as following. (1) Detection part: It is used to provide input sequences for the MPC model. Considering that this model is established based on meteorological forecasting parameters and the clothing thermal resistance, the connection with hourly weather forecasts, which are normal in many websites, is needed to be built. (2) Forecasting part: This is the core of MPC strategy. For the purposes of both indoor thermal comfort and energy conservation, there are two prediction models established respectively for the indoor thermal comfort and the corresponding air volume via natural ventilation. With the extracted mapping relations in data-driven prediction models, when the hour-ahead meteorological forecasting parameters were given, corresponding APMV and air volume at different openness could be obtained directly without iterative simulations in EnergyPlus. The criterion of indoor thermal comfort is adopted to guarantee that the use of energy-saving strategies (such as natural ventilation in this paper) is not carried out at the expense of personnel comfort feelings. While for passive buildings especially, the fresh air quantity as another criterion should also be guaranteed due to its strict airtight of envelopes. (3) Control part: Based on the output control signals as shown in Fig. 19 and PID control method, actions of opening/closing behaviors or turning on the mechanical fresh air system can be performed. Besides embedded into a system for AI automatic controls, this process can also be manually realized. In addition, this strategy is more applicable for passive buildings or rooms occupied by several people. This is because that for rooms only with one person, it is convenient to adjust the window openings according to personal preferences. However, for rooms with several people, it is quite difficult to compromise among different thermal preferences. In such circumstances, this MPC strategy can provide a well-accepted operation advice under standard clothing thermal resistances, which could reversely guide popular dressing habits as a manner of behavior energy-saving. 4.2 Limitations It is well-known that, for data-driven prediction models, different combinations of input parameters play an important role in the prediction accuracy. Based on the obtained database, the correlation heat map between environmental parameters and the evaluation index of APMV is shown in Fig. 21 . It can be concluded that the most related four parameters are outdoor temperature t(out), indoor temperature t(in), mean radiation temperature (MRT) and clothing thermal resistance (COL). However, considering the rare access to hour-ahead MRT & indoor temperature and the principles of natural ventilation, the input sequence was decided to conclude outdoor temperature, outdoor relative humidity, outdoor velocity and clothing thermal resistance, which are also quite related to APMV. In the future, when it is possible to predict more related meteorological parameters such as MRT, this MPC strategy could be more reliable. Besides, although it has been verified that the MPC strategy of natural ventilation can extend the application hours while maintaining a more stable indoor thermal environment, the principle of data-driven modeling decides that the accuracy and reliability depend on prediction models and obtained datasets to a great extent. However, it is very difficult to collect a complete real-time database at different opening degrees especially under the same meteorological environment. In addition, the database resulted from physical simulation based on Wind and Stack Open Area model in this paper is applicable for simulating natural ventilation from one side. While for buildings with obvious multi-zone wind-driven airflows, it is suggested that the AirflowNetwork model in EnergyPlus be adopted for simulation. Actually, no matter what models adopted, the obtained simulated database cannot perfectly reflect the practical ventilation effects. So in the future, based on the proposed model, it is planned to improve the modeling applicable scope by introducing quantitative feedbacks from human votes. In this personalization way, the disadvantage resulted from the limited access to real-time databases could be corrected to some extents. 5 Conclusions In order to postpone the usage of mechanical fresh air system in passive buildings such as the extra low-energy building, a data-driven MPC strategy for maximizing natural ventilation based on hour-ahead meteorological parameters was proposed in this paper, taking an office passive building in cold region in China as the case study. After being calibrated, this strategy based on data-driven models was applied and verified by comparisons via simulations. Based on the meteorological parameters and data-driven prediction models, suitable opening degrees corresponding to the predicted APMV can be calculated with an interval of 0.1 in a circular manner. On this basis, the ventilation volume is taken as another criterion, in order to compromise among energy-saving, steady indoor thermal environment and the demand of air change rate. It can be concluded that MPC strategies can both effectively improve the indoor comfort conditions and extend suitable hours for natural ventilation. It is also found that although faced with a special demand of fresh air exchange, with a comfort level closer to the thermal neutrality, the MPC strategy giving priority to thermal comfort is superior to that with priority to new air volume. Finally, it has been assessed that with this MPC strategy, the natural ventilation hours are increased by 56.3 % with 572 h, when compared with the suitable 366 h resulted from the traditional control method without adjustments. By adjusting window openness elaborately in advance according to the outdoor meteorological parameters, this strategy is established especially for passive buildings with a demand of extra fresh air after closing windows, for the purpose of maximizing the usage of natural ventilation as an energy-free system. In addition, it is more suitable for passive buildings with several people in one room, when it is difficult to compromise among different thermal preferences.

        "dc:description": "Due to the increasing demands of energy conservation and emission reduction, passive buildings with extra-low energy consumption and near zero energy consumption have attracted more attentions as a promising sustainable building type. Due to passive techniques such as air-tightness, passive buildings have a special demand of mechanical fresh air systems after closing windows. So it is indispensable to explore elaborate control strategies for maximizing natural ventilation, for the purpose of postponing the use of fossil energy. By taking meteorological forecast parameters as the input, an hour-head model-based predictive control (MPC) strategy of natural ventilation was proposed in this paper. Specifically, simulated multi-dimensional datasets obtained by setting different control actions under the same disturbances were obtained as the database for data-driven prediction models, which take weather forecast parameters as the input and labels of thermal comfort levels and air volumes as the output. It has been verified that although both with extended working hours and more stable comfort levels, the MPC strategy with priority to thermal comfort is superior to that with priority to fresh air volume. Furthermore, when compared with the traditional control strategy, ventilation hours via this MPC strategy could be increased by 56.3% from 366 h to 572 h. With this MPC model, the self-adaptive adjustment of window openness could be achieved by taking hour-ahead weather forecasting parameters as the input, thus to facilitate the climatic self-adaptive intelligent operation of passive buildings in future.",
