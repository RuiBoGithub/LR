Under the background of high global building energy consumption, meeting the ever-growing energy consumption demand of building energy system (BES) through renewable energy is one of the effective ways to promote the clean transformation of global energy structure and achieve \u201ccarbon neutrality\u201d. However, with the introduction of renewable energy, BES control becomes more complicated. The mismatch between supply and demand sides limits the further growth of renewable energy consumption, which is caused by fluctuation of renewable energy and randomness of load. Therefore, it is challenging to develop an efficient framework to realize the cooperative control of various controlled objects in supply and demand sides. To address this challenge, a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning framework was proposed to optimize the energy management of the building. In this paper, a dueling double deep Q-network was used for optimization of single agent, and value-decomposition network was put forward to solve the cooperation optimization of multiple agents. Also, considering the controlled characteristics of BES, prioritized experience replay and feasible action screening mechanism were introduced to accelerate the convergence and maintain stability of the algorithm applied to BES. Simulation results show that, the multi-agent cooperation algorithm can realize the control of variously different devices at the same time and achieve multi-objective cooperation optimization of BES. Moreover, the proposed approach reduced the uncomfortable duration by 84%, the unconsumed amount of renewable energy by 43%, and the energy cost by 8% compared with the conventional rule-based control approach.

By 2019, the global building energy consumption accounted for 35% of the total energy consumption, and the total CO2 emission of building operation was up to 10 Gt, accounting for 28% of the total global related carbon emissions [2]. In order to reduce the global carbon emission, the proportion of renewable energy in the terminal energy consumption of building energy system (BES) needs to be further improved [3\u20135]. To increase the renewable energy consumption, one of the feasible schemes is to introduce the energy storage system. However, due to the limitation of economic and occupied space, the capacity of energy storage system in conventional building systems is still unsatisfactory [6]. Thence, in the stage of building operation, how to use limited energy storage equipment to ensure occupant comfort while achieving renewable energy consumption is of great significance. Under the background of limited energy storage, it is particularly important to realize the dynamic matching between supply and demand sides through optimization control. Building control system can make buildings operate under the given conditions based on the input of external parameters, and can dynamically adjust and make decision according to the specific operation requirement, so as to achieve the optimal operation objectives. The conventional BES simulation and optimization are based on model predictive control, whose optimization result highly depends on the accuracy of the model, requiring expert knowledge for development and calibration. Moreover, model predictive control needs to spend some time to generate the optimal control strategy again when the system state changes. Therefore, in the operation control stage of the BES, it needs one control method that can realize the intelligent and adaptive control of the system according to the input parameters. Reinforcement learning (RL), which is very agile in responding to stochastic changes and can learn and explore by itself, is one of the feasible methods [7\u20139]. Some researchers had used RL algorithm to control BES. Taking the most representative Q-learning algorithm as an example [10], the earliest research appeared in 1997 [11], Q-learning was used to control the valve opening degree of a heating coil and the experiment showed that the control accuracy of Q-learning for electric heater was higher than that of PI controller. The research related to Q-learning applied to BES first appeared in 1998 [12]. Researchers used Q-learning to control on/off of air heating, lighting, ventilation, and water heating by observing the lifestyle and desires of inhabitants. In recent years, the researchers focused more attention on how to use RL algorithm to reduce the energy cost [13], improve the comfort [14\u201315] and enhance the control flexibility [16] of BES. Although RL method had made some achievements in the field of practical engineering, with the increasing complexity of BES, the conventional RL method was troubled by the problem of \u201ccurse of dimensionality\u201d [17], which made it difficult to learn effectively. Therefore, some researchers had proposed deep learning (DL) that could be used to almost any complex function [18] to provide a new \u201cbrain\u201d for RL algorithm. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is the combination of RL and DL, which can maximize the exploration of feasible action space [19\u201321]. The performance of the deep Q network (DQN) algorithm proposed by Google team in 2015 had surpassed human beings in Atari 2600 games [22]. Benefiting from its excellent \u201cwisdom\u201d, researchers tried to combine it with BES to realize the intellectualization of BES [23]. Currently, many researches on BES were still limited to building energy consumption and indoor comfort, and there were few researches on improving local renewable energy consumption through energy storage equipment. With the further research in the field of artificial intelligence, algorithms dealing with tasks of different complexity were emerging, such as Double DQN [24] and Dueling DQN [25]. Researchers in the field of energy could also use better algorithm to optimize BES. To solve over-estimation of value functions in DQN, Hasselt et al. [26] used different value functions to complete action selection and action evaluation, so as to solve the problem of over-estimation in the learning process. Therefore, based on dual neural network structure, using different neural networks to realize action selection and action evaluation is an effective way to avoid over-estimation. Yan et al. [27] applied the Double DQN algorithm to the air condition system of an office, which was built in the TRNSYS simulation platform. The simulation results showed that for the target of minimum energy consumption, this algorithm realized the energy-saving optimization operation of the system on the premise of meeting the requirements of indoor thermal comfort. Compared with DQN, the total energy consumption of the system was reduced by 1.64%, and the proportion of uncomfortable duration decreased by 1.37%. Liu et al. [28] applied Double DQN to home energy management system with solar PV, electric vehicles and other multiple devices. Compared with DQN, Double DQN performed better in energy efficiency management and stability of the system. Ding et al. [29] applied the control method based on Dueling Double Deep Q-network (D3QN) to balance the energy consumption and indoor comfort in commercial buildings, and obtained the optimal control sequence of HVAC, lighting, sunshade and window subsystems. The above research showed that the upgraded algorithm could improve the comprehensive performance of BES. The representative relevant applications of RL and DRL are summarized in Table1 . However, applying DRL algorithm alone will have some defects, such as slow convergence speed and low stability. Then, we consider to introduce the prioritized experience replay (PER) algorithm and a feasible action screening (FAS) mechanism into intelligent algorithms. Different from the conventional experience replay caching mechanism, PER algorithm [41\u201342] evaluated and sorted the priority of the experience data, and selected the experience with higher priority for model training. This algorithm increased the probability of important experience being replayed, and improved the efficiency of model sampling and learning. However, the optimization control of energy system is different from game simulation. It has clear physical laws in reality, and includes many inexecutable actions. Therefore, the theoretical model can be used to pre-screen the action space, and then make the agent choose the action in the feasible action space. Then, the agents will not violate the physical boundary whether being in the exploration mode or greedy mode, so as to ensure the stability of the algorithm. In order to achieve excellent energy consumption performance in BES, joint control of multiple equipment is needed. The conventional DRL algorithms are still based on the optimization of single agent. For the future BES coupled with cooling, heating and power supply, a single agent is unable to deal with the overlap of multiple adjustable parameters of multiple devices. The cooperation between multiple agents is needed to complete the task of intelligent control, and the DRL system consisted of multiple agents is called multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) system [43]. Fig. 1 shows the mind diagram of previous correlation research regarding BES. Hurtado et al. [44] applied extended join action learning algorithm to the multi-agent system to provide flexible power demand response for power grid while ensuring indoor comfort. Yu et al. [45] applied the actor-attention-critic algorithm to the optimization control of multi-area air condition system in commercial buildings, which achieved the lowest energy consumption on the premise of ensuring the thermal comfort and indoor air quality comfort. The results showed that when the thermal zones were more than 30, the average energy consumption of the algorithm was reduced by 56.50% and 75.25% respectively compared with that of the rule-based scheme and heuristic scheme control methods. Ahrarinouri et al. [46] studied the optimization control of the multi-carrier residential energy system. Each subject of the combined heat and power unit, electric vehicle, dishwasher and hot water heater was distributed an agent, which was trained using Q-learning algorithm. The results showed that compared with the conventional methods such as fuzzy and neural network and genetic algorithm, the multi-agent control method based on RL could save more energy costs. Kazmi [47] et al. found that the multi-agent cooperative control mode (MACCM) in BES was clearly superior to that of the single agent. Results showed that over 40% saving of building energy consumption was achieved by making use of either human expert knowledge or additional sensors with no loss of occupant comfort. At present, methods mainly used in the research of multi-agent cooperation were completely centralized and decentralized methods which had the problem of \u201clazy agent\u201d. When facing certain tasks, the approach above fails by learning inefficient policies with only one agent active and the other being \u201clazy\u201d. This happens when one agent learns a useful policy, but a second agent is then discouraged from learning because its exploration would hinder the first agent and lead to worse team reward observability. Hence, the effective cooperation between multiple controlled agents cannot be formed to achieve the optimization goal. The key of MADRL system is that agents not only need to interact with the environment, but also need to cooperate with other agents in the environment to complete the task, which means that convergence cannot be achieved in many cases. And when there are many various kinds of agents in the environment, the optimal solution may not exist if the target of each agent is not consistent. Therefore, the key to build MADRL algorithm is to combine with the practical application system, and to choose the appropriate algorithm according to its cooperation environment, cooperation model and cooperation mechanism. To address this challenge, value-decomposition network (VDN) was first proposed by DeepMind team in 2018. Then it was used to solve multi-agent cooperation problems in games, power grids, traffic and other fields, and achieved good optimization results [48\u201349]. Although the above works have made noticeable contributions to the applications of intelligent algorithms in BES, they did not consider the expanded application of algorithms in the increasingly complex BES currently. With the controlled objects increasing, most application of multi-agent cooperation algorithms in BES has the problem of \u201clazy agent\u201d, which makes it difficult to obtain the best control performance. Therefore, it is essential to consider the scalability of the algorithm while building more agents for controlled objects in BES. On the other hand, most of the works only focus on training the models to generate optimal actions and neglect whether generated actions conform to the actual operating conditions. However, strict physical constraints in BES control have to be considered, such as battery charge\u2013discharge level, etc. In view of these limitations, it necessary to established a FAS mechanism in the training process of the model. Driven by these motivations, this study established a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning control method to realize the joint intelligent control of multiple agents and optimized the energy cost, renewable energy consumption and indoor thermal comfort of the building equipped with energy storage devices. The main contributions of this study can be summarized as follows: 1. A novel DQN control strategy which combines D3QN with PER algorithm is proposed. Compared with conventional experience replay method, PER algorithm increases the efficiency of model sampling and accelerated the learning process of the algorithm applied to BES. 2. Aiming at the strict physical constraints in BES control, FAS mechanism is introduced. By using the existing theoretical model, the actions that violate the physical law are filtered in advance, which means the unrealistic actions generated by the model can be avoided during actual operation. To the best of our knowledge, the above mechanism has not been considered in the existing research works. 3. The VDN algorithm based on value function-decomposition is firstly proposed for BES, which solves the multi-agent reliability problems, and completes the joint intelligent control of multiple agents. The result proves that the proposed method can reduce the indoor uncomfortable duration and unconsumed amount of renewable energy at the lowest energy cost. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The system and entity model parameters are introduced in Section 2. Section 3 shows the D3QN-PER algorithm adopted by each agent and the MADRL algorithm for multi-agent cooperation. Sections 4 presents the results and discussion of the case study. Finally, Section 5 outlines our main conclusions 2 BES description 2.1 BES with multiple controlled agents The BES constructed in this study includes renewable energy supply system, as shown in Fig. 2 . The building is located in Tianjin, China, consisted of two office rooms (Room A/B) with the total area of 180 m2. The power supply includes the municipal power grid, photovoltaic and wind-driven generator. The cooling and heating supply is provided by ground source heat pump (GSHP), and the indoor temperature is controlled by adjusting the air volume setting of fan coil units (FCUs). The air volume is measured by the air volume ratio, which is the ratio of current air volume to maximum air volume. In addition, detailed components models, such as fan coils unit model, GSHP model, battery model, etc. and room temperature calculation model are given in Appendix A. 2.2 Parameters of controlled subjects The controlled subjects in the system include the battery, four FCUs in the left room (room A) and two FCUs in the right room (room B). The FCUs of the two rooms are under unified control, that is, four FCUs in room A and two FCUs in room B are under unified control of air volume respectively. The specific adjustment parameters are shown in Table 2 As shown in Table 2, the air volume of FCU includes 4 optional values, of which 0 represents off and 1 represents maximum air volume. That is, the four optional values of 0, 0.3, 0.6 and 1 correspond to off, low wind, medium wind and high wind respectively. The action space of the agent controlling the FCU is [0, 0.3, 0.6, 1]. The adjustable parameter of the battery is charge\u2013discharge rate, i.e., the change of SOC. The setting of the value refers to the maximum charge and discharge power of the battery, so as to ensure that the charge\u2013discharge can be completed. The positive value and negative value represent charging and discharging the battery respectively, and 0 means no operation. The action space of the agent controlling battery is [-0.015, −0.01, −0.005, 0.005, 0.01, 0.015]. 3 Framework of D3QN-PER and VDN algorithm According to the above description, Double DQN and Dueling DQN are the derivative algorithms of DQN, which perform better in BES. For each controlled subject of BES, the D3QN [53] - a combination of Double DQN and Dueling DQN-was adopted for each agent, and VDN was used for multi-agent cooperation in this study. 3.1 Double DQN algorithm Different from DQN algorithm, Double DQN separates action selection and action evaluation in the target Q value, making them use different Q networks. In the Double DQN algorithm, the target Q value is as follows: (1) r + γ Q ( s \u2032 , arg max a \u2032 Q ( s \u2032 , a \u2032 ; w ) ; w - ) where Q is current value network; r is reward; γ is attenuation factor; s' is the state of the next moment; a' is the action of the next moment; w is the weight of the current network; and w- is the weight of the target network. 3.2 Dueling DQN algorithm The network structure of Dueling DQN is shown in Fig. 3 . Different from deep neural network (DNN) in DQN which directly outputs the Q value, Dueling DQN outputs the predictive state value function V and the prediction relative advantage function A respectively after obtaining the intermediate characteristics. The two functions are added as action value functions. Through training V and A at the same time, the overfitting problem during network training can be avoided and the training speed of the network can be accelerated: (2) Q ( s , a ; θ , α , β ) = V ( s ; θ , β ) + A ( s , a ; θ , α ) where s is current state; a is current action; θ is full connection layer parameters of the main line; α and β is the full connection layer parameters of two branches. 3.3 PER algorithm PER algorithm is different from prioritized cleaning algorithm, it can replay more useful experience in the learning process with higher frequency. PER algorithm uses TD-error in temporal difference (TD) algorithm to measure the effect of each experience. Taking DQN algorithm as an example, TD error is calculated as the absolute value of the difference between the Q value of an action target and the current Q value of the current DNN output [42]: (3) TD - error = r + γ max a \u2032 Q ( s \u2032 , a \u2032 , w ) - Q ( s , a , w ) When sampling, greedy priority and uniform random sampling methods are added to ensure that the priority of empirical samples is directly proportional to TD-error. Meanwhile, it is ensured that the sampling probability of empirical samples with the lowest priority is also non-zero. The sampling probability of empirical sample i is defined as follows: (4) P ( i ) = p i o ∑ k p k o where pi is priority of empirical samples; o is sampling coefficient, when o is equal to zero, it means that uniform random sampling is applied for experience replay. In Eq. (4), pi is calculated by proportional prioritization method, which is as follows: (5) p i = TD - e r r o r + ε where ε is greedy rate, which can avoid the problem that the empirical samples will not be replayed when TD-error is zero. After obtaining the learning samples, in order to eliminate the deviation caused by sampling, the concept of importance-sampling weight is introduced for correction. The calculation method of weight is as follows: (6) ω i = ( N · P ( i ) ) - p max j ω j 3.4 D3QN-PER algorithm principle After combining D3QN algorithm and PER algorithm, the calculation method of TD-error needs to combine the characteristics of Dueling DQN and Double DQN, The Eq. (6) is modified as follows: x (7) where Q ̂ is target value network; θ ̂ , α ̂ , β ̂ are weight parameters of target value network. The loss function of DQN algorithm also needs to be calculated according to two value networks at the same time, and the weight correction of PER algorithm needs to be considered. The equation is as follows: (8) L = ω · E [ ( r + γ Q ^ ( s ' , a r g m a x a ' Q ( s ' , a ' ; θ , α , β ) ; θ ^ , α ^ , β ^ ) - Q ( s , a ; θ , α , β ) ) 2 ] The schematic diagram and pseudocode of D3QN-PER algorithm are shown in Fig. 4 and Algorithm 1 respectively. In order to simplify the expression, the weight parameters of value network in the diagram are shown by w. In the control cycle, the control algorithm of each agent uses the current value network Q to select the action (a) which is shown in Table 2 according to the observed state (s) of BES at each time. The selected actions (a) of each agent act together on the environment to generate the next state (s') and corresponding reward (r) of BES. In the training cycle, when enough empirical samples are stored in the experience replay pool, the system will extract experience samples according to priority to train the current value network Q.

Through the study of interaction behavior among agents and interaction behavior between agents and environment, the whole environment is learned, as shown in Fig. 5 [54]. 3.6 VDN algorithm In order to ensure cooperative optimization of each agent under the consistent target, the VDN algorithm was used in this study. VDN algorithm can reflect the consistent target of all agents by assuming the sum of Q value of each agent [51]. Using the above DRL algorithm based on value function approximation to give \u201cintelligence\u201d to agents, we need to model the joint action-value function of the system. Supposing there are n agents in the system, then the joint Q function of all agents can be expressed as: (9) Q ( ( s 1 , s 2 , . . . , s n ) , ( a 1 , a 2 , . . . , a n ) ) where sn is the local state that each agent can observe, s n in BES contain the joint state of agent1, agent2 and agent3, as showed in Table 3 ; an represents the action taken by each agent. The basic assumption of VDN is that the joint Q function of the system can be approximated to the sum of Q functions of multiple agents. (10) Q ( ( s 1 , s 2 , . . . , s n ) , ( a 1 , a 2 , . . . , a n ) ) ≈ ∑ i = 1 n Q i ( s i , a i ) where Qi is independent, which only depends on the local state information si and action ai . The assumption of Eq. (10) can guarantee that the action obtained by maximizing the Q function of each agent is the same as the result obtained by maximizing the joint Q function, which is: (11) max a Q = max a ∑ i = 1 n Q i = ∑ i = 1 n max ai Q i In other words, each agent's Q function can be trained indirectly through global reward. Moreover, the global optimal strategy can be obtained by selecting the action of maximizing Q value for each agent. (12) arg max a Q = ( arg max ai Q i ) The network structure of VDN algorithm with two agents is shown in Fig. 6 . Although each agent chooses action through its own network, joint Q function is used in learning. The intelligent control method of BES established in this study will use D3QN-PER algorithm to build control strategy for each agent, and use VDN algorithm to build multi-agent joint optimization framework. The MADRL control logic of the established BES is shown in Fig. 7 . 3.7 System evaluation method In order to comprehensively evaluate the operation characteristics of BES, this study evaluated it from three aspects: energy cost, unconsumed amount of renewable energy and thermal comfort, then the reward function was built accordingly. (1) Energy cost Referring to Appendix A, according to the characteristics of the system, the evaluation parameters of energy cost are as follows: (13) cost = cos t total - ∑ k = 1 K O k e k cos t total where cost total is the normalized reference indicator of energy cost, which is computed by the benchmark model, CNY (Chinese Yuan); ∑ k = 1 K O k e k is the actual energy cost of one system operation cycle, CNY. (2) Unconsumed amount of renewable energy The unconsumed amount of renewable energy in one system operation cycle is the sum of the unconsumed amount at each time. (14) waste = wast e total - Δ t ∑ k = 1 K P rw k wast e total where waste total is the normalized reference indicator of unconsumed amount of renewable energy, which is computed by the benchmark model, kWh; Δ t ∑ k = 1 K P rw k is the actual unconsumed amount of renewable energy in one system operation cycle, kWh. (3) Thermal comfort The maximum uncomfortable heating duration in one operation cycle is converted according to the annual maximum uncomfortable heating duration. The thermal comfort evaluation indicator is as follows: (15) com = co m total - ∑ k = 1 K coun t com k co m total where com total is the maximum uncomfortable heating duration in one operation cycle, minute; ∑ k = 1 K coun t com k is the total uncomfortable duration of the system in one operation cycle, minute. (4) Comprehensive evaluation indicator The operation of BES needs to consider multiple evaluation indicator. Therefore, according to the Eq. (13) ∼ (15), the multi-target evaluation parameters are established as reward: (16) r = w cost · c o s t + w waste · w a s t e + w com · c o m where w cost , w waste and w com are the weight coefficients of the 3 evaluation indicator which are set to 0.75, 1 and 0.75 , respectively. 3.8 FAS mechanism In this study, FAS mechanism was designed for the battery in BES. Referring to the battery model in Appendix A, the screening method is as follows: (17) L BA = 0.2 ⩽ S O C k + a BA ⩽ 1 , a BA ⩾ 0 0.2 ⩽ S O C k + a BA ⩽ 1 ; 0 ⩽ e k - ( e re k - e rw k ) + a BA · e bmax , a BA < 0 where a BA is the control action of the battery; ek is the power consumption of the office at k time period, kWh; e re k is the renewable energy generation at k time period, kWh; e rw k is the unconsumed renewable energy at k time period, kWh; e bmax is the maximum capacity of the battery. I.e., the action a BA selected at each time can\u2019t make the SOC of the battery at the next time exceed the physical boundary limit, and the battery discharge cannot be incorporated into the power grid. Based on the above mechanism, it can ensure that the system can run for a complete cycle. 3.9 Parameter setting of controlled model The environment construction of BES in this study used the mathematical model established in Appendix A, and the equipment adjustment mode was set according to Section 2.2. The room temperature state and GSHP real-time working condition shown in Fig. 1 were calculated through the established equipment mathematical model. 3.9.1 Benchmark control model The control strategy of the benchmark model controls the air volume ratio of Room A/B and SOC of battery respectively. G FCU-A and G FCU-B are the control variables that affect the actual energy consumption in the system. The adjustment of air volume ratio will affect the real-time indoor temperature state and the working state of GSHP. Fig. 8 shows the control logic of the system under the benchmark model. The information that needs to be exchanged in the control process between supply and demand is the total energy consumption and the local price. According to the municipal power price and renewable energy generation capacity, the SOC of battery is dynamically adjusted to ensure the most economical power supply. When the local power price is relatively low, the consumption of renewable energy can be increased by adjusting the equipment to increase power consumption. When the local electricity price is relatively high, the economic operation can be realized by reducing power consumption. In the logic framework shown in Fig. 8, the specific adjustment logic of air volume ratio for the rooms is shown in Table 4 , in which the detailed values of all adjustable parameters are listed. When the room is unoccupied, and the room temperature is below the setting range, the air volume ratio is set to 0.3, otherwise set to 0. When the room is occupied, and the room temperature is below, among and above the setting range, the air volume ratio is set to 1, 0.6 and 0.3 respectively. 3.9.2 Multi-agent cooperative control model Under MACCM, each agent no longer has a clear control logic, and action section at each time is completely determined by the DRL algorithm of each agent. To ensure the control logic consistent, hierarchical control logic of supply and demand is also adopted in multi-agent cooperation, as shown in Fig. 9 . 1. In the first layer, agent1 and agent2 select action G FCU-A and action G FCU-B according to their respective states, and the selected actions interact with the environment to affect the indoor temperature state; 2. In the second layer, agent3 selects action a BA according to its own state, which considers the energy consumption impact of agent1 and agent2 on the environment; 3. In the third layer, the environment generates the state of agent1 and agent2 at the next time, which includes the energy consumption impact of agent3 on the environment. Under this control model, each agent will not only affect the environment, but also the other agents, so as to form a clear cooperative relationship. The local observation state of each agent in the control logic is shown in Table 3 above. 4 Results and discussion In this study, A rule-based benchmark control model and MACCM are used to optimize BES with a period of 3 days, and each day is divided into 1440 period, i.e., time step is 1 min. 4.1 Analysis of benchmark model By automatically adjusting the operating conditions of FCUs, the balance can be achieved between comfort and energy saving. According to the control rule of benchmark model, when indoor occupancy state or the range of local power price change, the setting range of indoor temperature will change accordingly. Detailed values of parameters setting refer to Table 4 and the energy consumption of BES with a period of 3 days adopting the benchmark model is shown in Table 5 . The detailed analysis is as follows: (1) Indoor temperature analysis The control of indoor comfort is the key to the operation of the system which has priority over energy cost and consumption of renewable energy. The room temperature change of room A and B in the 3-day control period is shown in Fig. 10 in which the upper and lower limits of indoor comfortable temperature is marked with dotted lines. Fig. 10 shows that the indoor temperature of room B is generally lower than that of room A, which is due to that there are two FCUs in Room B and four FCUs in room A. In addition, the temperature of room A drops faster at night, which is due to that room A has two external walls that leads to greater heat dissipation. During the whole control period, the uncomfortable duration of two rooms when occupied is 287 min. According to the national heating standard GB50736-2012, the total uncomfortable duration of the system in the 3-day control period should not exceed 48 min, and the result of the benchmark model far exceed this value. (2) Analysis of renewable energy consumption This study focuses on the local consumption of renewable energy and the unconsumed amount of renewable energy shown refers to which not used by the system. The renewable energy power generation and unconsumed renewable energy of BES during the 3-day control period are shown in Fig. 11 . Fig. 11 shows that unconsumed renewable energy is mainly concentrated at night, which is due to the low power demand caused by the electrical equipment being turned off and the indoor temperature maintained at a lower level. Hence, the redundant renewable energy cannot be consumed when the battery is full. The intermittent fluctuation of unconsumed amount is caused by the intermittent start-up of FCUs and GSHP. In the whole control period, the power generation, unconsumed amount and consumption ratio of renewable energy are 139.5 kWh, 24.9 kWh and 82.1%, respectively. 4.2 Analysis of optimization process The total number of iterations of the multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm is 10000, and the results are output every 25 iterations. The changes of key indicators in the learning process are as follows: (1) Change of reward The change of rewards in the learning process of the algorithm is shown in Fig. 12 . xIt can be seen from Fig. 12 that due to the high greedy rate, the algorithm is in the exploratory state in which each agent tends to randomly select actions in the early stage and the rewards fluctuate greatly. However, due to enough attempts, the algorithm also has the chance to get higher rewards. In the later stage, each agent tends to choose the action with higher Q value as the greedy rate decreases, and finally the fluctuation of reward gradually decreases and stabilizes at a higher value. (2) Change of uncomfortable duration During the learning process of the algorithm, the change of indoor temperature uncomfortable duration of two rooms in BES is shown in Fig. 13 . The uncomfortable duration in the 3-day control period should be controlled within 48 min according to the conversion value of heating standard. The fluctuation of uncomfortable duration is more severe in the early stage, which is due to the random action selection of agent and leads to an uncomfortable indoor environment. As the number of iterations increases, the uncomfortable duration tends to be stable. Since the task of controlling the room temperature is relatively simple, agent1 and agent2 soon learn how to optimize the control. (3) Renewable energy consumption The utilization of renewable energy is the focus of the current energy system, and how to effectively improve the local consumption is the key. The variation curve of unconsumed amount of renewable energy during the algorithm learning process of the system is shown in Fig. 14 . It can be seen from Fig. 14 that in the vast majority of cases, the value of unconsumed renewable energy of MACCM is lower than that of the benchmark model, and the difference between the two models is more obvious when the value is stable in later stage. However, in the early exploration stage, there are a large number of values with smaller amount of unconsumed consumption renewable energy, which needs to be further analyzed combined with the energy cost. (4) Energy cost The energy cost of the system is the concentrated embodiment of economy. The change of energy cost in the algorithm learning process of the system is shown in Fig. 15 . The fluctuation in Fig. 15 is similar to that in Fig. 14, and MACCM is more economical than the benchmark model in most cases. Similarly, some values in the exploration stage are better than those in the stable stage, which needs to be analyzed in combination with Figs. 13-15. In the three groups of results, all the values that better than the final stable results cannot be achieved at the same time. For example, when the energy cost is very low, each agent chooses to make the room more uncomfortable, and gives up the storage of renewable energy, and prefers to store valley price electricity. Although the individual indicator is better, the overall reward is lower, and the later stable value is the result of multiple indicator equilibrium. 4.3 Result analysis of MACCM According to the output results of the model iteration under MACCM, the energy consumption performance of BES in the 3-day control period is shown in Table 6 . Compared with the benchmark model, the above indicators of MACCM are significantly decreased, especially the uncomfortable duration is kept within the limit value of the national heating standard. The detailed analysis is as follows: (1) Indoor temperature analysis The change of indoor temperature under MACCM is shown in Fig. 16 . The upper and lower limits of comfortable temperature in the heating standard are marked with two blue dotted lines. In Fig. 16, it can be observed that the duration outside the comfort range of the MACCM is significantly reduced compared with that of the benchmark model. Different from the way of controlling indoor temperature using the given control strategy, the change of room temperature under MACCM has no obvious periodicity. In general, due to more FCU equipment in room A, the temperature of room A is higher than that of room B in daytime, which is the opposite at night because of larger areas of external walls in room A. In order to observe the difference in detail, the temperature change of the same room under two control models is analyzed, as shown in Fig. 17 . As shown in Fig. 17, compared with the benchmark model, the indoor temperature of room B is significantly higher at night, and relatively lower during the day. This indicates that the agents can consume the surplus renewable energy by increasing the indoor temperature at night, and reduce the energy cost by decreasing the indoor temperature when the electricity price is high during the day. Therefore, compared with the established control strategy, multi-agent cooperative control can learn strategies with long planning horizons based on the reasonable parameter settings during training. (2) Analysis of renewable energy consumption This study focuses on the local consumption of renewable energy, therefore the unconsumed amount refers to the part not used by the system. Fig. 18 shows the renewable energy generation capacity and unconsumed amount in BES during 3-days control period. As shown in Fig. 18, the unconsumed amount of renewable energy is significantly lower than that under the benchmark model, especially at night. Combined with the analysis of indoor temperature changes, MACCM can consume more renewable energy by increasing indoor temperature at night when equipped with the same capacity of batteries. It effectively uses the heating load as a flexible adjustable resource to increase the utilization rate of local renewable energy in the form of demand response. (3) Analysis of battery charge\u2013discharge Energy storage equipment is considered to be an important equipment for effective consumption of renewable energy. How to achieve more consumption under limited storage capacity is also a key problem to be solved by the control strategy. The change of SOC under the two control models is shown in Fig. 19 . As shown in Fig. 19, neither of the two control models chooses bulk charging due to the high power consumption and electricity price. At night, the system tends to charge to full directly under the benchmark model when the renewable energy generation capacity is high. However, the MACCM takes priority to consume more self-generated energy. 5 Conclusion The BES integrated with renewable energy is a complex system, in which the randomness and volatility of renewable energy on the supply side and the randomness of energy consumption on the demand side will have significant influence. Therefore, it is important to control the key equipment on both sides of supply and demand intelligently. Aiming at solving this problem, this paper proposed a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm which could optimized the energy cost, renewable energy consumption and indoor thermal comfort of the building, and achieved better optimization results. The achievements and conclusions of this study can be summarized as follows: (1) Mathematical models of each equipment and building load calculation were established for a single BES. Besides, a more intelligent D3QN-PER algorithm was deployed in the controlled agents of BES to meet the increasingly complex control tasks. (2) The VDN algorithm based on value function-decomposition was applied to the multi-agent deep reinforcement learning control method to realize the joint intelligent control of multiple agents. Furthermore, considering the controlled characteristics of BES, PER and FAS mechanism were introduced, which greatly reduced the training time and improved the stability of the algorithm applied to BES. (3) According to the established system evaluation method, compared with the benchmark control model, the multi-agent cooperation algorithm reduced the uncomfortable duration by 84%, the unconsumed amount of renewable energy by 43%, and the energy cost by 8%. As a common method, the multi-agent deep reinforcement learning control method for single building proposed in this study can be applied to the optimization of regional building energy systems. Although early model training of MADRL will take some time, it can greatly improve the flexibility of controlling regional building energy system, and promote the regional renewable energy consumption as well as peak load cutting and valley filling compared with conventional control algorithm. In this study, the intelligent optimization method of BES was discussed, and there are still some imperfections. For example, the evaluation and control of indoor comfort is relatively simple. Therefore, more control parameters of indoor comfort will be taken into consideration in the following research, such as PM2.5 concentration, CO2 concentration, indoor air velocity, etc. Also, we will.

Appendix A Environment construction The detailed notes and parameter setting of the component models, room temperature calculation model, power demand and local price model in BES established in this study can refer to another published papers of our research team [55]. (1) Components model (a) Fan coils unit model The indoor temperature was primarily controlled by changing the amount of heating supplied by the FCU. The heating capacity of the FCU (Q FCU) was calculated using the enthalpy difference between the inlet and outlet air. (A1) Q FCU = Δ t · G FCU C a T a + H a 2500 + 1.84 T a - G FCU C a T FCU + H a 2500 + 1.84 T FCU Based on Q FCU, the relationship between the output temperature of the water tank and the FCU output temperature can be derived as (A2) Q FCU = C w m w Δ t T FCUb - T FCU The FCU power consumption in each stage was calculated by Eq. (A-3): (A-3) e FCU = P rFCU · G FCU G rFCU 3 · Δ t (b) GSHP model When the water in the water tank enters GSHP, the compressor will start heating when the water temperature is lower than the setting point of the heat pump temperature (40 ℃). According to Eq. (A-4), the water supply temperature of GSHP can be calculated. (A4) T G = T tank + Δ t P GSHP Δ t C w m w , T tank < T q T G = T tank , T tank ⩾ T q According to the coefficient of performance (COP), the power consumption of GSHP can be further calculated. COP formula is obtained by fitting the actual operation data, as shown in Eq. (A-5). (A5) COP = 1.190230 × 10 3 x 6 - 5.130190 × 10 3 x 5 + 8.944914 × 10 3 x 4 - 8.102804 × 10 3 x 3 + 4.038387 × 10 3 x 2 - 1.047582 × 10 3 x + 1.118404 × 10 2 , x ⩾ 0.4 C O P = 1.8 , x < 0.4 (A6) x = P GSHP / P rGSHP where P rGSHP is the GSHP heating power; x is the load rate. According to the COP and heating power of GSHP, the power consumption of GSHP can be calculated by Eq. (A-7) (A7) e GSHP = Δ t P GSHP / COP where, e GSHP is GSHP power consumption. (c) Battery model In this study, SOC is used to represent the capacity state of battery and one day is divided into k stages in this model. Eq. (A-8) can be used to calculate the SOC of battery at each time stage. (A8) SOC = SO C k + 1 = S O C k - z bc k · P bc k - z bdc k · P bdc k · Δ t e bmax S O C k + 1 , S O C k ∈ 0.2 , 1 P bc k ∈ P bc,min , P bc,max P bdc k ∈ P bdc,min , P bdc,max z bc k + z bdc k ⩽ 1 Charge-discharge will cause the capacity loss of the battery. When the charge\u2013discharge cycle depth of the battery is Δ S O C , the maximum number of charge\u2013discharge cycles N before the failure of the battery can be calculated by Eq. (A-9). Formula (A-10) can calculate the equivalent power cost of the battery by using the maximum charge\u2013discharge cycles. (A9) N = b 1 + b 2 e bmax b 3 · Δ S O C + b 4 e bmax b 5 · Δ S O C . . . 10) O b k = O I N (d) Renewable energy model Renewable energy generation capacity is the collected actual data, and real-time power generation capacity is shown in Fig. A-1 . The installed capacity of wind turbine and photovoltaic is 3 kW and 3.9 kW, respectively. The time step of generation capacity data is minutes. (e) Water tank model The water tank is connected with FCU and GSHP to stabilize the supply. The heat transfer model of the water tank was established by using the multi-node model, that is, the water tank was divided into multiple layers along the vertical direction. Assuming that each layer can be completely mixed in the calculation process, the energy balance equation of node u can be expressed as: 11) m u d T tank, u d τ = F u G m G ( T G - T tank, u ) - F u FCU m F ( T tank, u - T FCU ) - ( hA C w ) ( T tank, u - T o ) + m m, u ( T tank, u - 1 - T tank, u ) , m m, u > 0 m m, u + 1 ( T tank, u - T tank, u + 1 ) , m m, u + 1 > 0 (2) Room temperature calculation model (a) Room temperature state equation This study defined room temperature as the air temperature and assumed that indoor air temperature was uniform. Factors that affect room temperature include heat generation from personnel and equipment and heat transfer from walls and windows. The room temperature is calculated by Eq. (A-12): 12) C a m a T a k + 1 - T a k = Δ t Q p k + Q light k + Q c k + ∑ i = 1 6 A w, i h w,in, i T w,in, i k - T a k + A gs h gs T o k - T a k + ρ a V a A leak C a T o k - T a k + C a G FCU k T FCU k - T a k (b) Wall temperature state equation The heat transfer model is shown in Fig. A-2 . The air and wall surface exchanged heat through convective heat transfer, while heat conduction occurred inside the wall. External wall temperature equations, Equations (A-13) and (A-14), were constructed without considering the effects of solar radiation. 13) C w, i m w , i T w,o , i k + 1 - T w,o, i k = Δ t A w, i h w,o, i T o k - T w,o, i k + λ δ A w, i T w,in, i k - T w,o, i k + α solar A w, i G 14) C w , i m w , i T w,in, i k + 1 - T w,in, i k = Δ t A w , i h w,in , i T a k - T w,in, i k + λ δ A w , i T w,o, i k - T w,in, i k Assuming that the temperatures of the inner wall's two surfaces are the same. To facilitate the calculation, the inner wall was divided into two equal parts to exchange heat with the adjacent room's air. The internal wall temperature state equation is shown in Eq. (A-15) 15) C w, i m w, i 2 T w,in, i k + 1 - T w,in, i k = Δ t A w, i h w,in, i T w,in, i k - T a k (3) Power demand and local price model (a) Power demand The power demand of this system mainly comes from GSHP, FCU, lighting equipment and computers. The total power demand can be calculated by Eq. (A-16), and the power balance constraint of the system is shown in Eq. (A-17). 16) e k = e GSHP k + e light k + e C k + e FCU k 17) P e k + P re k + P bc k - P bdc k - P rw k · Δ t = e k (b) Local price The local price is different from that of the municipal power grid because of the presence of local renewable energy. The local power price is the average value of the cost of various power supply methods at time k, as shown in Eq. (A-18). 18) O k = P e k · O e k + P re k · O re k + P b k · O b k P e k + P re k + P b k Because this paper focused on the operation stage of BES, the initial investment cost of renewable energy generation equipment was not considered temporarily, and only the operation and maintenance cost was considered.

        "dc:description": "Under the background of high global building energy consumption, meeting the ever-growing energy consumption demand of building energy system (BES) through renewable energy is one of the effective ways to promote the clean transformation of global energy structure and achieve \u201ccarbon neutrality\u201d. However, with the introduction of renewable energy, BES control becomes more complicated. The mismatch between supply and demand sides limits the further growth of renewable energy consumption, which is caused by fluctuation of renewable energy and randomness of load. Therefore, it is challenging to develop an efficient framework to realize the cooperative control of various controlled objects in supply and demand sides. To address this challenge, a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning framework was proposed to optimize the energy management of the building. In this paper, a dueling double deep Q-network was used for optimization of single agent, and value-decomposition network was put forward to solve the cooperation optimization of multiple agents. Also, considering the controlled characteristics of BES, prioritized experience replay and feasible action screening mechanism were introduced to accelerate the convergence and maintain stability of the algorithm applied to BES. Simulation results show that, the multi-agent cooperation algorithm can realize the control of variously different devices at the same time and achieve multi-objective cooperation optimization of BES. Moreover, the proposed approach reduced the uncomfortable duration by 84%, the unconsumed amount of renewable energy by 43%, and the energy cost by 8% compared with the conventional rule-based control approach.",
