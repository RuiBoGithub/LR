Building temperature setpoints affect both HVAC energy consumption and occupant comfort. To reduce HVAC energy usage, researchers often investigate how system operations can be optimized under weather and occupancy variability subject to a fixed setpoint that minimizes any possible discomfort. While previous research has explored the selection of dynamic setpoints to minimize HVAC energy consumption based on outdoor temperature, they have often neglected the impact of varying occupancy rates on the setpoints. This paper aims to demystify energy savings derived from fixed and dynamic temperature setpoints under weather and occupancy variability and explores the additional energy savings that can be achieved through dynamic temperature setpoints. An exhaustive HVAC zone temperature setpoint optimizer was developed to determine dynamic setpoints with respect to weather and occupancy (i.e., setpoints that minimize HVAC energy consumption at different occupancy rates based on outdoor weather). U.S. DOE reference building energy models for small, medium, and large office buildings were simulated at 17 climate zones, 4 occupancy rates (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) and 7 setpoints (19.5°C to 25.5°C at 1°C interval). It was found that, both fixed and dynamic setpoints benefit from the energy reduction of approximately 2-4% from the lower heat generated by the occupants at lower occupancy rates. However, at outdoor temperatures between 5°C and 32°C where occupant heat loads can swing the building between heating, free-running, and cooling modes, dynamic setpoints yield additional 2-10% energy savings, compared to fixed setpoints.

In fact, more than one third of total global energy consumption is attributed to buildings [1]. Specifically, heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems are the most energy demanding building services in urban environments, accounting for close to 50% of their total energy consumption and considered a primary driver for the increase in greenhouse gas emissions [2]. Despite their significant impact on energy use, it is estimated that 90% of HVAC systems are not operated efficiently [3]. For this reason, potential savings on total buildings\u2019 energy consumption can be obtained by implementing advanced controllers and strategies at no extra financial cost [4,5]. Among various building parameters, indoor temperature setpoints display the largest impact on systems\u2019 operation efficiency for both radiant [6] and all-air systems [7]. Typically, indoor temperature setpoints are set based on international standards and regulations to provide satisfactory thermal conditions and indoor air quality for building occupants [8,9]. However, research has shown that adjusting temperature setpoints displays a high potential to achieve energy savings [10\u201312], while ensuring acceptable occupant's thermal comfort and indoor air quality [13\u201318]. As an example, Hoyt et al. (2015) [11] quantified that a wider temperature setpoint range of 18.3 - 27.8°C can save between 32% and 73% of HVAC energy consumption, depending on the climate. Based on the promising energy-saving potential, further research has employed optimization algorithms to identify the temperature setpoints that ensure the lowest energy consumption without detrimentally affecting occupants\u2019 comfort [19\u201321]. Although optimal temperature setpoints can increase energy savings, if they were to be adopted in practice they would commonly be fixed throughout the whole year [16,22]. In response, recent research studies investigated the potential of dynamic temperature setpoints that vary across operation periods based on outdoor weather (e.g., outdoor temperature) [23\u201326]. The identification of dynamic setpoints is not trivial since the setpoint that ensures the lowest energy consumption for a certain outdoor condition might instead be sub-optimal when this changes. Furthermore, building occupants have been widely recognized among the factors driving building energy consumption through their passive presence and active behaviour [27,28]. Occupancy in buildings can be quantified through the percentage of occupants (i.e., number of occupants divided by the maximum occupancy) at a given time, herein defined as occupancy rate, and the occupancy patterns within occupied periods. Despite the acknowledgement of the role of occupants, the majority of HVAC systems are operated based on static pre-defined occupancy schedules [29]. However, actual occupancy rates and patterns are highly dynamic, often diverging from the values recommended in building codes [30]. This has become even more prevalent since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to an increased adoption of remote working and flexible working hours. Therefore, the stochastic nature of occupancy presents an opportunity to unlock additional energy savings [31]. As a result, in recent years, there has been a growing interest from both academia and industry in the integration of occupancy information into the control logic of HVAC systems to improve building energy efficiency, commonly defined as occupant-centric or occupancy-based controls [32]. In fact, by including occupancy information, the heating and cooling volume can be adjusted depending on periods of low or high internal heat loads, which ultimately results in energy savings. Therefore, an increasing volume of research (both simulation-based and through field implementation) is focusing on the development of occupancy-based control algorithms and the demonstration of the energy-saving potential of such control strategies. While research studies typically utilize occupancy information as binary decisions to deliver heating/cooling under rule-based fixed temperatures during occupancy while adopting setbacks during unoccupied periods [33\u201339], few research contributions shifted instead their focus from fixed to dynamic zone temperature setpoints tailored to occupancy [40]. In summary, researchers often explored how system operations can be optimized under weather and occupancy variability subject to a fixed setpoint that minimizes any possible discomfort. While previous research has explored the selection of dynamic setpoints to minimize HVAC energy consumption based on outdoor temperature, they have often neglected the impact of varying occupancy rates on the setpoints. Therefore, the energy-saving potential of dynamic temperature setpoints under occupancy remains unclear. This paper demystifies energy savings derived from fixed and dynamic temperature setpoints under weather and occupancy variability and explores the additional energy savings that can be achieved through dynamic temperature setpoints. To achieve this aim, this contribution (1) presents an exhaustive HVAC zone temperature setpoint optimizer based on outdoor weather and occupancy, (2) identifies the fixed and dynamic optimal temperature setpoints across building sizes and climate zones, and (3) analyses and compares the energy savings that can be obtained by tailoring HVAC operation based on building occupancy through fixed and dynamic temperature setpoints. The findings presented in this paper aid building stakeholders to evaluate and compare the energy savings derived from the integration of weather and occupancy into the control logic of HVAC systems through the adoption of fixed and dynamic temperature setpoints. A comprehensive simulation framework was developed to analyze and compare the sources of energy savings from fixed and dynamic temperature setpoints. An exhaustive HVAC zone temperature setpoint optimizer was developed to identify optimal temperature setpoints with respect to weather and occupancy (i.e., setpoints that minimize HVAC energy consumption at different occupancy based on outdoor weather). Optimal setpoint is the setpoint at which energy used by HVAC system to establish a heat balance between indoor heat loads and outdoor heat transfer is minimized. U.S. DOE reference building energy models for small, medium, and large office buildings were simulated at 17 climate zones, 4 occupancy rates (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) and 7 setpoints (19.5°C to 25.5°C at 1°C interval). The reformulation of the problem from a multi-objective (energy and thermal comfort) to a single objective (energy) optimization with thermal comfort as a constraint allows to focus on the investigation of the relationships between optimal setpoints at different occupancy rates and outdoor conditions. In fact, building occupants perceive comfort in a range of thermal conditions [41] and a number of environmental and human related variables (e.g., weather and acclimation) affect individuals\u2019 thermal comfort, causing it to be transient, changing over time [42,43]. However, humans have a natural tendency to adapt to changing conditions in their environment which forms the basis of the adaptive principle of thermal comfort expressed by the principle that \u201cif a change occurs such as to produce discomfort, people react in ways which tend to restore their comfort\u201d [41]. Therefore, it is possible to control HVAC systems through the identification of optimal temperature setpoints that ensure thermal satisfaction in that range while minimizing its energy consumption [44,45]. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides a literature review of studies highlighting the impact of temperature setpoints on building energy consumption as well as research investigating fixed and dynamic temperature setpoints and associated energy savings and highlights the research gap. Section 3 presents the methodological approach adopted in this paper which includes the data generation, data harvesting, and the evaluation framework. The results are discussed in Section 4 while limitations and future steps of the study are detailed in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 breakdowns the results and concludes the paper. 2 Literature review In recent years, previous research has shown the significant influence of temperature setpoints on HVAC operation. Therefore, several temperature setpoint strategies and smart control systems have been examined and adopted to control building HVAC systems and reduce energy consumption. Generally, extending the temperature setpoints and deadbands represents the simplest approach to attain energy savings. This strategy widens the range of temperatures at which HVAC systems operate and reduces the demand for heating or cooling building zones. Hoyt et al. [11] estimated the energy savings by widening the heating setpoint from 21.1°C to 17.7°C and the cooling setpoint from 22.2°C to 30°C, across six medium-sized office building in seven climate zones. The results indicated that, by increasing a cooling setpoint of 22.2°C to 25°C and decreasing a heating setpoint of 21.1°C to 20°C, an average of 29% of cooling energy and 34% of heating energy can be saved without sacrificing satisfactory temperature levels. Additionally, it was concluded that a wider 18.3°C \u201327.8°C setpoint temperature range could save between 32% and 73% of the total HVAC energy consumption, depending on the climate. Although this study systematically quantified the extent of energy-saving potential while considering specific climate conditions, extending the difference between heating and cooling would always ensure energy savings. Additionally, it is unclear which heating and cooling setpoints are optimal for a certain climate. Ghahramani et al. [24] filled this gap by identifying the optimal daily and annual setpoints and deadbands across climate zones, building sizes, building vintages and quantified the potential energy savings that can be obtained compared to a baseline value. The findings indicated that the selection of the daily optimal setpoint in the range of 22.5 ± 1°C, 22.5 ± 2°C, and 22.5 ± 3°C would result in an average savings of 7.5%, 12.7%, and 16.4%, respectively, compared to the baseline setpoint of 22.5°C. Finally, the potential savings from selecting daily optimal setpoints based on outside temperature led to 10.09\u201337.03%, 11.43\u201321.01%, and 6.78\u201311.34% savings for small, medium, and large office buildings respectively, depending on the climate. Although this study explores the potential of dynamically adjusting the setpoints with respect to outdoor conditions, the full extent of energy savings might not be exploited due to the lack of occupancy information for optimal setpoint identification. Despite the significant energy-saving potential of HVAC temperature control strategies, additional savings can be unlocked with the integration of occupancy information into the control logic of HVAC system. In fact, especially in the post COVID-19 era, office buildings might not be always occupied, and the percentage of occupancy might vary during occupied periods. Therefore, since HVAC system operate to ensure occupants\u2019 thermal comfort and satisfactory levels of indoor air quality, there is an opportunity for energy savings if controllers are able to determine occupancy rates and patterns to deliver heating, cooling, and ventilation tailored to dynamic building occupancy. According to Park et al. (2019) [46], the majority of the studies from the past decade that investigated occupancy-based HVAC system controls were conducted with the aid of simulation tools. In addition, they varied between contributions that explored simple controllers and studies that developed complex algorithms that exploited the potentialities of machine learning (ML) and model predictive control (MPC) techniques. Goyal et al. [47] evaluated a simple rule-based feedback controller and an MPC based on real-time optimization at the University of Florida and identified that both occupancy-based controls yielded around 40% of energy savings compared to a conventional baseline controller while ensuring thermal comfort and indoor air quality. Additionally, they concluded that simple control algorithms display a similar energy savings potential compared to more complex controllers. Furthermore, research studies investigating occupancy-based controls typically utilized occupancy information as binary decisions to deliver heating/cooling at fixed temperatures during occupancy while implementing setbacks during unoccupied periods. For instance, Baldi et al. [33] proposed an occupancy-based controller based on three basic rules for cooling setpoint identification, applied to a simulated office building in Crete, Greece: (1) a pre-cooling setpoint to turn on the HVAC system before arrival, (2) a normal mode when occupants are present in the zone with fixed temperature setpoints at 24°C and 25°C, and (3) a setback setpoint when occupants are not present (30°C). Compared to static pre-programmed strategies, this research showed that 15% of energy can be saved while increasing the percentage of thermal satisfaction. However, a parallel research avenue instead focuses on the development of dynamic zone temperature setpoints controllers tailored to occupancy. Wang et al. [40] proposed a controller to optimize HVAC temperature setpoints in real-time based on predicted values of internal heat gains. The occupancy-based optimizer displayed energy savings between 3.8% and 36.8% for heating and 3.5%-33.9% for cooling. Additionally, occupant's thermal dissatisfaction decreased by up to 5% in winter and 3% in summer. While this study further highlighted the potential of dynamically selecting the setpoints based on occupancy, the impact of outdoor air temperatures was neglected and the setpoint was solely adjusted based on internal heat gains. Peng et al. [39] investigated the potential of learning occupancy-related information to infer real-time temperature setpoints to control cooling systems. They tested the learning-based controller on eleven office spaces representing typical office uses: single-person, multi-person, and meeting rooms and reported between 7% and 52% of energy savings compared to a conventionally-schedules cooling system. Although the results presented in this paper were derived exploring 4 occupancy patterns with different arrival, departure time, and total occupied duration, where either temperature setpoints or setbacks were assigned, this study proposed a rule-based control algorithm with fixed temperatures. In fact, only four temperatures can be selected: a comfort temperature setpoint, an idle temperature setback of + 1°C with respect to the comfort temperature setpoints, a deep idle temperature setback of + 0.5°C with respect to the idle setback, and an economy temperature of 35°C. 3 Methodology The methodological approach to address the research gap summarizes the (1) data generation where the temperature setpoints, occupancy rates, climates, and any other influential factor are defined along with a description of their representation in the simulation models Section 3.1), the (2) data harvesting where the simulation procedure and the HVAC zone temperature setpoint optimizer for the identification of the fixed and dynamic setpoints and energy usages is described Section 3.2), and the (3) evaluation framework where the calculation method for energy savings derived from fixed and dynamic setpoints is illustrated (Section 3.3). In summary, seven temperature setpoints, four occupancy rates, seventeen climates, and three building sizes were selected as variables and their values were discretized (Section 3.1). The Department of Energy (DOE) reference office buildings were employed as whole-building simulation models for EnergyPlus [48]. 1,428 combinations of values (7 setpoints x 4 occupancy rates x 17 climates x 3 building sizes) were generated through an exhaustive search method (Section 3.2). An HVAC zone temperature setpoint optimizer was developed to identify optimal temperature setpoints with respect to weather and occupancy (i.e., setpoints that minimize HVAC energy consumption at different occupancy based on outdoor weather) across climates and building sizes by searching through the exhaustive dataset of parameters\u2019 combinations. Consequently, fixed and dynamic setpoints were identified and the derived energy savings were quantified and analyzed (Section 3.3). 3.1 Data generation (problem formulation) Table 1 breakdowns the variables and their option values investigated in this paper. Seven temperature setpoint values were discretized by assigning a granularity of 1°C from 19.5°C to 26.5°C. The range was selected based on temperatures at which occupants\u2019 thermal comfort will be maintained and the effects on occupant discomfort is likely minimal [8,9]. Since HVAC systems operate based on a univariate control logic where the system is triggered to deliver either heating or cooling based on the temperature setpoint and outdoor air temperature (single input/single output)[49], the characterization of the setpoint as a single parameter (rather than investigating heating and cooling setpoints separately) has been selected. Four occupancy percentages were defined as proxies for the rate of occupancy in buildings and they range from a lightly occupied building (25%) to a fully occupied one (100%), acting as changes in occupant's heat loads. All sixteen U.S. climates in addition to the tropical climate of Singapore (0A) were explored as they cover a variety of climate zones, from hot and humid (Miami - zone 1) to subarctic (Fairbanks, Alaska \u2013 zone 8). The climate zones ensure the identification of optimal setpoints based on various outdoor conditions. Three building sizes based on the number of floors are investigated: small building with one floor, medium size building with three floors, and large building with twelve floors. The three options aid to investigate the impact of the outdoor conditions on the size of buildings and their geometries. U.S. DOE office reference buildings have been employed as whole-building simulation models for EnergyPlus. The newly constructed office buildings category (after 2004) was selected since occupancy-based controls in practice can only be implemented in new generations of HVAC systems. Seventeen types of buildings in seventeen different climates from the most populous cities in each climate zone were obtained for each building size (small, medium, large). These models represent realistic building characteristics and construction practices where roof and wall U-values, slab-on-grade and underground R-values, window U-values, and solar heat gain coefficients (SHGCs) are varied depending on climate conditions. In addition, they include different HVAC systems depending on the building type. EnergyPlus conducts HVAC system sizing based on guidelines from ASHRAE Standards 62.1 and 90.1. The software utilizes an 'auto-sizing' feature, which automatically calculates the optimal size of HVAC system components based on the heating and cooling loads. This is achieved by considering a multitude of factors such as the building's location, geometry, fabric construction and window characteristics, internal gains from occupants and equipment, as well as infiltration and ventilation rates. Figure 1 depicts the building geometries of the small, medium, and large-sized office buildings. Construction materials and equipment systems are detailed in Table 2 and are based on ASHRAE Standards 90.1-2004 (ASHRAE 2004a) and 62.1-2004 (ASHRAE 2004b) [48]. Occupancy and operation profiles are assigned to the reference building models: weekdays when the HVAC system operation is on from 8:00 to 18:00, Saturdays when the energy system operates from 9:00 to 17:00, and Sundays and holidays when the system is off the entire day. Internal heat loads of the simulated DOE small, medium, and large office buildings are presented in Table 3 , and their schedule follows ASHRAE Standard 62.1-2004 [48]. This study is based on the total HVAC energy consumption as building performance metric for the evaluation framework presented in section 3.3, expressed as the sum of the energy consumption of HVAC components for both heating and cooling. 3.2 Data harvesting (simulation and optimization) This research employed an exhaustive (full factorial) search method for the generation of the solutions due to its ability to sample the entire search space. Through the discretization of variables, 1,428 combinations of values are investigated (7 setpoints x 4 occupancy rates x 17 climates x 3 building sizes), corresponding to an equivalent number of EnergyPlus simulations. The simulation models were run via Python programming language through the modification of the building energy model files (.idf file). Each model's text file was searched to locate the investigated variables and replace the desired values. The output of each simulation provided building energy consumption for a whole year on an hourly basis. A yearly period was selected to cover climatic variations. The process was automated via code and parallel computing shortened the computational time. The summation of the energy consumption on an hourly basis was calculated to obtain daily values for each permutation of variables. The initial 28 days were removed to account for the effects of the simulation warm-up days [50]. Additionally, weekends and holidays were excluded due to the fact that HVAC systems are either not operating or operated for a lower amount of time. An HVAC zone temperature setpoint optimizer Equation (1) and (2) was developed to identify the optimal temperature setpoints with respect to weather and occupancy (i.e., setpoints that minimize HVAC energy consumption at different occupancy based on outdoor weather) across climate zones and building sizes. By searching through the exhaustive dataset of parameters\u2019 combinations, the algorithm sorts the energy consumption derived by different temperature setpoints and identifies the lowest value. This process is repeated for each value of occupancy rate. While a fixed setpoint remains constant throughout the whole year and is identified based on the annual outdoor air temperature as average across the daily values, regardless of the occupancy rate, the dynamic setpoint is derived from the daily outdoor air temperature and occupancy rate values.

Firstly, this paper quantifies the impact of lower heat loads at different building occupancy rates on the HVAC energy consumption. The daily average energy reduction across occupancy rates was calculated with respect to the HVAC energy consumption obtained for 100% occupancy. The daily average difference in HVAC energy usage at the same setpoint between each occupancy rate and the baseline reference (100%) was calculated as percentage of energy reduction (Equation 3). (3) Ener gy Savin g heat loads ( % ) = ∑ d = 1 365 ( | E base lin e d − E occu pancy _ rat e d | E base lin e d ) × 100 % 365 Where: E baselined = baseline daily energy consumption at 100% occupancy rate., E occupancy_rated = daily energy consumption at 75%, 50%, and 25% occupancy rate. This paper then calculates the additional daily average energy savings from optimal selection of setpoints under weather and occupancy variability. The optimal setpoint obtained for 100% occupancy rate was adopted as baseline. The daily average difference in HVAC energy usage obtained for each optimal setpoint and the baseline reference (optimal setpoint identified at 100% occupancy) was calculated as percentage of daily average energy savings (Equation 4). (4) Ener gy Savin g opti mal setp oint ( % ) = ∑ d = 1 365 ( | E base lin e d − E opti mal _ setp oin t d * ) | E base lin e d ) × 100 % 365 Where: E baselined = baseline daily energy consumption for the setpoint obtained at 100% occupancy rate., E optimal_setpointd = daily energy consumption for the setpoint obtained at 75%, 50%, and 25% occupancy rate. 4 Results and discussion 4.1 Fixed temperature setpoints As described in Section 3.2, fixed yearlong temperature setpoints were derived utilizing the optimization function defined in Equation (2). Figure 2 illustrates the fixed setpoints for the investigated three building sizes and 17 climates. As expected, the hotter the climate, the higher the identified optimal setpoint that minimizes HVAC energy consumption. Furthermore, Figure 2 highlights the differences in optimal setpoints across building sizes. Generally, optimal setpoints are insensitive to the size of buildings for warmer climates where different building sizes identified the same optimal temperature setpoint. Contrarily, larger buildings in colder climates display a higher optimal temperature setpoint compared to smaller buildings. This is due to the lower influence of outdoor conditions and higher dependency on building energy systems. On average, across climates, 24.5°C represented the optimal setpoint temperature for all the building sizes. 4.2 Energy reduction from lower occupant heat loads Fixed yearlong temperature setpoints benefit from the reduced energy due to the lower heat generated by the occupants at lower occupancy rates. This represents the only source of energy reduction that can be obtained by integrating fixed-setpoint occupancy-based strategies into the control loop of HVAC systems. The values of energy reduction from fixed setpoints are presented as daily average percentages across each occupancy rate with respect to the HVAC energy consumption obtained for a fully occupied building (100%), adopted a baseline reference (Equation 3). Figure 3 illustrates the daily average percentage of energy reduction obtained from fixed setpoints across occupancy rates, for the investigated climates and building sizes. Generally, warmer climates can achieve higher energy reductions compared to climates with colder outdoor temperatures. This is because, in this study, the impact of lower occupant heat generated at lower occupancy rates is averaged across heating and cooling modes. Therefore, HVAC systems in cooling-dominated climates need to offset lower occupant-generated heat loads in addition to the heat transfer from the outdoor environment. Additionally, as the occupancy rate decreases, heat loads decrease and energy reduction increases, regardless of the climate and building size. For small, medium, and large office buildings, using fixed setpoints at 75% occupancy rate would lead to 1.54%, 1.20%, and 1.63% daily average energy reduction across climates, respectively, compared to operation for a fully occupied building. Energy reduction due to lower occupancy head loads increased to 3.31%, 2.50%, and 3.11%, respectively, for operation for 50% occupancy rate, and 4.39%, 3.53%, and 4.21%, respectively, for operation at 25%. Additionally, larger office buildings obtained higher energy reduction due to a higher dependency on indoor heat loads rather than outdoor weather. On average, daily energy reduction of up to 4% can be achieved at 25% occupancy when adopting fixed setpoints. 4.3 Dynamic temperature setpoints Dynamic temperature setpoints were obtained utilizing the optimization function defined in Equation 1. Figure 4 depicts the dynamic setpoints with respect to outdoor temperatures at different occupancy rates. The climate-based analysis was carried out for the small building size since outdoor air temperature has a larger impact on optimal setpoints compared to large office buildings. Generally, a strong correlation (monotonic behaviour) appears between optimal setpoints and the outdoor environment. The hotter the outdoor environment, the higher the dynamic setpoint that minimizes HVAC energy consumption. Figure 5 illustrates the variation of dynamic temperature setpoints across occupancy rates, averaged by climate and building size. A regularized linear regression line has been applied to the optimal setpoints to display the trend at each occupancy rate. For outdoor temperatures of up to 5°C, the lowest evaluated setpoint (i.e., 19.5°C) was identified as optimal setpoint temperature to minimize HVAC energy consumption and increased with progressively higher outdoor temperatures. From outdoor temperatures of 32°C, the highest evaluated setpoint (i.e., 25.5°C) was instead found to minimize the energy consumption. Therefore, at outdoor temperatures below 5°C and above 32°C, optimal temperature setpoints (19.5°C and 25.5°C) are insensitive to different occupancy rates. For outdoor temperatures between 5°C and 32°C, the occupancy rates displayed an impact on dynamic temperature setpoints since different optimal setpoints were obtained depending on the building occupancy. Generally, for the same outdoor temperature, a lower setpoint in case of heating and a higher setpoint in case of cooling were found as the optimal at lower occupancy rates. This is due to a lower occupant generated heat which in turn reduces the need of the HVAC system to provide cooling. At 25% occupancy rate and within the 5°C-32°C range, the optimal setpoints were on average 1°C different than at 100%. Therefore, at moderate outdoor temperatures, the amount of heat loads can swing the building between heating, free-running, and cooling modes and dynamic setpoints can tailor HVAC system operation based on the occupancy rate. 4.4 Energy reduction from lower occupant heat loads Daily average energy reduction values from lower occupant heat loads (Equation 3) are depicted in Fig. 6 , for the investigated climates and building sizes. In agreement with the findings from fixed setpoints, as the occupancy rate decreases, heat loads decrease and energy reduction increases, regardless of the climate and building size. Additionally, warmer climates can achieve higher energy reduction compared to climates with colder outdoor temperatures since HVAC systems in cooling-dominated climates need to offset lower occupant-generated heat loads in addition to the heat transfer from the outdoor environment. For small, medium, and large office buildings, using dynamic setpoints at 75% of occupancy rate would lead to 1.99%, 1.75%, and 2.51% daily average energy reduction across climates, respectively, compared to operation for a fully occupied building. Energy reduction increased to 3.89%, 3.34%, and 4.12%, respectively, for operation for 50% occupancy rate, and 6.07%, 5.08%, and 6.39%, respectively, for operation at 25%. It can finally be noticed that a large size office building obtained higher energy reduction since it displays a higher dependency on indoor heat loads, while outdoor conditions have a smaller impact. On average, daily savings of up to 6% can be obtained at 25% occupancy when adopting dynamic setpoints. This is greater than the energy savings obtained using fixed setpoints (4%) due to the fact dynamic setpoints minimize the heat transfer for each day as opposed to the entire year. 4.5 Additional energy savings from optimal selection of setpoints under weather and occupancy variability As highlighted in Section 4.2, optimal setpoints for moderate outdoor temperatures between 5°C and 32°C vary based on occupancy and outdoor temperature and result in additional energy savings to the energy reduction due to the lower heat loads at lower occupancy rates (section 4.2.1). In this temperature range, heat loads can swing the building between heating, free-running, and cooling modes and dynamic setpoints increase energy savings by tailoring HVAC operation based on the occupancy rate. Figure 7 depicts the daily mean energy savings (derived from Equation 4) from the optimal setpoints across occupancy rates, for the investigated building sizes and averaged across climates. Generally, the energy savings that can be obtained through optimal setpoint increase with lower rates of occupancy during occupied periods. This is because for the same outdoor temperature, a lower setpoint in case of heating and a higher setpoint in case of cooling were found as the optimal at lower occupancy rates. Additionally, the building size displays an impact on the magnitude of changes in optimal setpoints. Larger buildings displayed larger changes in optimal setpoints compared to smaller buildings. In fact, it can be noticed that compared to the optimal setpoints at 100% occupancy, a difference of up to 3°C was observed in the optimal setpoints in the small building, and it increased to up to 4 and 5°C for a medium and large building, respectively. For a small office building, optimal selection of setpoints at 75%, 50%, and 25% occupancy rate would lead to 1.82%, 2.93%, and 3.79% energy savings, respectively, compared to energy usage at optimal setpoint for a fully occupied building. Energy savings increased to 2.05%, 3.10%, and 4.26%, respectively, at 75%, 50%, and 25% occupancy rate for medium buildings, and 8.89%, 10.33%, and 11.12%, respectively, for large buildings. Therefore, a large size office building obtained higher energy savings as it allows for higher magnitudes of dynamic setpoints changes across occupancy rates. 4.6 Total energy savings from occupancy-based dynamic temperature setpoints In summary, energy savings from dynamic setpoints can be derived from the reduced heat loads generated by the occupants at lower occupancy rates and, in the 5°C - 32°C temperature range, from optimal selection of setpoints under weather and occupancy variability. Figure 8 shows the climate-averaged total energy savings that can be obtained by adopting dynamic setpoints with respect to the optimal HVAC energy consumption obtained for a fully occupied building. For small and medium buildings, energy reduction due to lower heat loads generated by the occupants is greater than the additional savings derived from optimal selection of setpoints across occupancy rates. Contrarily, the largest portion of energy savings for a large building is obtained from optimal selection of setpoints. For a small and medium office building, optimal selection of setpoints at 75%, 50%, and 25% occupancy rate would lead to 3.74% - 3.96%, 6-31% - 6.67%, and 8.99% - 9.37% energy savings, respectively, compared to energy usage at the optimal setpoint for a fully occupied building. Comparatively, for large buildings, energy savings increased to 11.08%, 14.32%, and 17.09%, respectively, at 75%, 50%, and 25% occupancy. 4.7 Energy savings from fixed and dynamic temperature setpoints Previous research has either explored the energy savings associated with the selection of setpoints based on outdoor temperature or investigated the impact of occupancy on energy savings under rule-based fixed setpoints. Therefore, this paper benchmarked the energy-saving potential from dynamic setpoints compared to fixed setpoints under both outdoor temperature and occupancy variability. This study for the first time segregated the energy savings from setpoints into the energy reduction attributed to lower occupancy heat loads at lower occupancy rates and energy savings from optimal selection of fixed and dynamic setpoints (Figure 9 ). The energy reduction from lower occupancy rates which could be considered \u201cfree savings\u201d, are often not explicitly reported by studies employing occupancy-based controls and could amount to 3.98%, 3.39%, and 4.34% of total HVAC energy consumption for small, medium, and large buildings, respectively. In comparison, previous studies, such as Baldi et al. [33], Peng et al. [38,39], which reported between 7% to 21% energy reduction from rule-based fixed temperature setpoints based on occupancy variability, did not segregate energy savings from occupancy rates and full absenteeism (i.e., periods of unoccupancy). In addition, unlike previous research mostly based on single case studies, this paper included 3 building sizes (i.e, small, medium, and large) and 17 climate zones across the U.S and tropical climate to provide generalizable takeaways. This limitation complicates the selection of setpoint strategies in buildings for different climates, building sizes or where rarely full absenteeism occur. In contrast, our study systematically quantifies the energy savings attributed to variations in occupant heat loads and selected fixed setpoint separately during lower occupancy rates. In a future study, we aim to study energy savings from optimal selection of setpoints not only for different occupancy rates but also for various occupancy patterns with unoccupied periods based on typical office scenarios and this inherently could lead to higher energy savings. The existing systematic large-scale simulation study on the impact of temperature setpoints on the HVAC energy consumption utilized outdoor temperature as the only dynamic factor. While the impact of occupants and their heat loads was acknowledged as a major dynamic factor in selection of optimal setpoints, it remained unexplored over the past decade, primarily due to the complexity of the simulations and data analytics. In a pioneering attempt, our study revisited this gap and aimed to include the dynamic nature of occupancy rates and the interaction with outdoor temperature within the context of optimal temperature setpoints. We found that for very low (below 5°C) or high (above 32°C) outdoor temperatures, the identified optimal setpoint is the lowest (i.e., 19.5°C) or highest (i.e., 25.5°C) evaluated setpoint, respectively, regardless of occupancy rate. However, for moderate outdoor temperatures between 5°C and 32°C where heat loads can swing the building between heating, free-running, and cooling modes, dynamic setpoints yield additional 2.36%, 3.28%, and 10.26% daily average energy savings due to the optimal selection of the setpoint across occupancy rates. This results in an additional 3.3%, 4.26%, and 11.26% daily average energy savings compared to the optimal fixed setpoint. In contrast, Ghahramani et al. [24] found potential savings ranging from 7.5% to 16.4% energy savings compared to 22.5°C solely based on outside temperature, ignoring the impact of varying occupancy. We adopted the optimal fixed setpoint as baseline since this paper compares the optimal selection of both fixed and dynamic setpoints, making energy savings incomparable. In a future study, the dynamic selection of temperature setpoints could be explored by incorporating a temperature setpoint optimizer in the control loop of HVAC systems. The optimizer would need to receive the indoor occupancy information (rates and patterns), the internal and external indoor temperatures from sensing devices to select the optimal setpoint. In addition, machine learning (ML) methods could help to predict optimal setpoints over time. 5 Limitations and suggestions for future research The limitations of this study are evident if it is acknowledged that an optimization process is only able to identify optimal solutions for the defined problem formulation (investigated setpoints, climates, sizes, and occupancy rates). If these are changed, it cannot be certain that equal results will be obtained. Additionally, while the range of setpoints explored was selected based on occupants\u2019 thermal comfort requirements and the investigated climates cover a variety of climate zones to ensure the identification of optimal setpoints across different outdoor conditions, the building occupancy rates are discretized to facilitate their comparison. However, in reality, the percentage of occupancy presence is not static throughout the occupied periods but varies dictated by occupant behaviors. Although for this initial study the adoption of simple static occupancy rates was determined to quantify the energy-saving potential of fixed and dynamic temperature setpoints under weather and occupancy variability, future research will include variants of the occupancy rates investigated herein to explore dynamic temperature setpoints based on dynamic behaviors. Furthermore, this research is based on a daily occupancy period from 8:00 to 18:00. The impact of different occupancy periods and patterns will be considered in future research where unoccupied periods and patterns of absenteeism will be introduced. Further studies will cast light on the relationship between dynamic setpoints and setbacks, outdoor temperatures and building occupancy rates & profiles as they represent the parameters that can lead to energy-efficient and comfort-driven HVAC operation. However, due to the infeasibility of the implementation of exhaustive search methods in real buildings\u2019 HVAC controllers, further research is needed to implement techniques able to select dynamic setpoints and setbacks based on the outdoor temperatures and building occupancy conditions in a more efficient manner. This will result in the development of data-driven algorithms for HVAC operation based on low-data requirement. ML could increase efficiency by predicting optimal setpoints over time based on weather and occupancy data. Furthermore, a finer spatial and temporal scale could be investigated to improve the efficiency of HVAC operation. In fact, in this study, uniform parameters were assumed for all the zones with simulated buildings. However, non-uniform parameters might lead to higher energy savings. For example, the higher solar gains of a zone located on the perimeter of a building could impact dynamic setpoints and setbacks as well as the heat loads generated by different occupancy rates, profiles, lighting systems and appliances might vary for different zones based on different end-uses. This could lead to more advanced control strategies. Additionally, a finer temporal granularity could increase the energy savings of dynamic setpoints and setbacks. In fact, hourly optimal values could be calculated, or they could be clustered based on periods within a year, such as \u201cseasons\u201d. However, the trade-off between the complexity of the controller and the potential energy savings need to inform the decision-making process regarding the spatial and temporal granularity selection. Although this study is the first to establish the recommended high and low temperature bands based on outdoor temperature thresholds, further research is needed to recommend heating and cooling periods at different variations of moderate outdoor air temperatures. Finally, additional research is needed to investigate the potential integration of dynamic setpoints, and demand control ventilation (DCV) based on building occupancy and outdoor weather. 6. Conclusion This paper demystifies energy savings derived from fixed and dynamic temperature setpoints under weather and occupancy variability. To achieve this aim, this paper (1) presents an exhaustive HVAC zone temperature setpoint optimizer based on outdoor weather and occupancy, (2) identifies the fixed and dynamic optimal temperature setpoints across building sizes and climate zones, and (3) analyses and compares the energy savings that can be obtained by tailoring HVAC operation based on building occupancy through fixed and dynamic temperature setpoints. A simulation framework was developed to analyze and compare the energy reduction from lower heat loads generated by the occupants at lower occupancy rates and the additional savings derived from optimal selection of setpoints. Seven temperature setpoints (19.5°C to 25.5°C at 1°C interval), four occupancy rates (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%), and seventeen climates, were selected and implemented as variables within the U.S. DOE small, medium, and large reference office buildings simulation models for EnergyPlus. In total, 1,428 combinations of discretized variables were sampled. An HVAC zone temperature setpoint optimizer was developed to identify optimal temperature setpoints with respect to weather and occupancy variability (i.e., setpoints that minimize HVAC energy consumption at different occupancy based on outdoor weather) across climates and building sizes by searching through the exhaustive dataset of parameters\u2019 combinations. Consequently, fixed and dynamic setpoints were identified and the derived energy savings were quantified and analyzed. The key findings are presented as follows: 1) For low (below 5°C) or high (above 32°C) outdoor temperatures, the lowest or highest evaluated setpoint is the optimal, respectively, regardless of occupancy rate. Therefore, the energy reduction derived from both fixed and dynamic setpoints is solely due to lower occupancy heat loads at lower occupancy rates. At these temperatures, energy reduction obtained from dynamic setpoints is greater compared to fixed setpoints since dynamic setpoints minimize the heat transfer for each day as opposed to the entire year. In fact, while daily average energy reduction for fixed setpoints is 3.08%, 2.41%, and 2.99% for small, medium, and large buildings, respectively, it increases to 3.98%, 3.39%, and 4.34% for dynamic setpoints. 2) For moderate outdoor temperatures between 5°C and 32°C, where heat loads can swing the building between heating, free-running, and cooling modes dynamic setpoints yield additional 2.36%, 3.28%, and 10.26% daily average energy savings, compared to fixed setpoints. In this temperature range, for the same outdoor temperature, a 1°C lower setpoint in case of heating and a 1°C higher setpoint in case of cooling were identified as optimal at lower occupancy rates, on average. 3) Although both fixed and dynamic setpoints benefit from the naturally occurring lower heat generated by the occupants at lower occupancy rates, optimal selection of setpoint based on weather and occupancy variability results in dynamic setpoints providing additional energy savings. Total daily average energy savings of dynamic over fixed setpoints is 3.3%, 4.26%, and 11.26% for small, medium, and large buildings, respectively. The findings presented in this paper demonstrate that in addition to the naturally occurring energy reduction due to the lower heat loads at lower occupancy rates, dynamic temperature setpoints benefits from an extra layer of savings derived from the optimal selection of setpoint based on weather and occupancy variability. In addition, this study represents the foundation for further research on the development of data-driven algorithms for HVAC operation with respect to weather and occupancy variations.

        "dc:description": "Building temperature setpoints affect both HVAC energy consumption and occupant comfort. To reduce HVAC energy usage, researchers often investigate how system operations can be optimized under weather and occupancy variability subject to a fixed setpoint that minimizes any possible discomfort. While previous research has explored the selection of dynamic setpoints to minimize HVAC energy consumption based on outdoor temperature, they have often neglected the impact of varying occupancy rates on the setpoints. This paper aims to demystify energy savings derived from fixed and dynamic temperature setpoints under weather and occupancy variability and explores the additional energy savings that can be achieved through dynamic temperature setpoints. An exhaustive HVAC zone temperature setpoint optimizer was developed to determine dynamic setpoints with respect to weather and occupancy (i.e., setpoints that minimize HVAC energy consumption at different occupancy rates based on outdoor weather). U.S. DOE reference building energy models for small, medium, and large office buildings were simulated at 17 climate zones, 4 occupancy rates (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) and 7 setpoints (19.5°C to 25.5°C at 1°C interval). It was found that, both fixed and dynamic setpoints benefit from the energy reduction of approximately 2-4% from the lower heat generated by the occupants at lower occupancy rates. However, at outdoor temperatures between 5°C and 32°C where occupant heat loads can swing the building between heating, free-running, and cooling modes, dynamic setpoints yield additional 2-10% energy savings, compared to fixed setpoints.",
