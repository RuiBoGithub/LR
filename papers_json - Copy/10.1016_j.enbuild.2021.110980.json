Ventilation has proved to be an effective solution for reducing building cooling load in high-rise buildings, i.e. ventilative cooling (VC), especially in cold climates. Mechanical ventilation system can achieve VC (i.e. mechanical VC) in high-rise buildings, but it needs appropriate control to reduce cooling related energy consumption and to consider the impact of climate change. This study aims to develop an optimal control method for mechanical VC and evaluate its energy performance, based on an advanced model. In this advanced model, a machine learning model was applied to predict building cooling load and energy models were developed to predict energy consumption. A case study was conducted on a real high-rise building located in Montreal (Canada). Using the measured data from the Building Automation System (BAS), the machine learning model, generated by an algorithm called Gradient tree boosting (GTB), was found to be the most accurate and was used in the optimal control method. The energy models that couple mechanical ventilation and chiller cooling were validated with the BAS measured data. Then, the optimal control method was applied to study the energy performance of mechanical VC under long-term climate conditions. The results indicate that the energy savings of mechanical VC will decrease around 16% during the summer but increase around 105% during the shoulder season due to climate change. The optimal nominal ventilation rate for mechanical VC in the typical meteorological year is twice of that in the 2080 s A1FI weather scenario.

Even in a cold climate, the growth of space cooling demand is significant. For example, the energy used for space cooling in the commercial/institutional sector of Canada increased from 30.3 PJ in 1990 to 50.6 PJ in 2017 [2]. Due to climate change, the number of cooling degree days (CDDs) is estimated to continually increase from 297 CDDs in 2013 to 806 CDDs by 2070 in Montreal (Canada) [3]. To reduce cooling-related energy consumption and peak electricity demand, it is essential to reduce the cooling load of buildings, especially high-rise buildings. Due to large glazing façades and high internal heat gain [4,5], high-rise buildings usually have a higher cooling load and thus nearly two and a half times the electricity use per square meter than low-rise buildings [6]. In addition, the number of high-rise buildings increased rapidly in recent years due to population growth and limited land in cities [7]. Therefore, it is essential to reduce the building cooling load of high-rise buildings. Building ventilation is an effective approach for reducing building cooling load [8,9], i.e., ventilative cooling (VC) [10]. Previous studies have shown that cooling-related energy consumption can be reduced by 30% to 77% in high-rise buildings by using building ventilation [11\u201313]. There are three types of building ventilation: natural ventilation, mechanical ventilation, and hybrid ventilation. A number of previous studies have focused on natural ventilation and hybrid ventilation because of their huge potential in reducing cooling-related energy consumption [14]. The application of natural and hybrid ventilation in high-rise buildings usually depends mainly on large vertical spaces, such as atria and double-skin façades, as the paths for ventilation [14\u201317]. However, fire protection concerns regarding potential risks (fire smoke may spread through the large vertical spaces and is difficult to control) limit their applications in high-rise buildings [14,18]. Therefore, most high-rise buildings use mechanical ventilation, which controls the airflow easily and has fewer fire safety issues [19]. One of the challenges blocking the use of mechanical ventilation for VC is a lack of proper control strategies, because mechanical ventilation is generally designed to maintain indoor air quality. Previous studies have shown that mechanical VC cannot always achieve energy savings, because the ventilation fans may consume a considerable amount of electricity [20]. Optimal control strategies for mechanical VC are necessary to ensure that mechanical VC can save energy compared with traditional cooling approaches, e.g. chiller cooling. Some previous studies have proposed a control strategy for mechanical VC. These studies, however, only conducted the simulations or experiments in a room or a low/medium-rise building [21\u201327], rather than focusing on high-rise buildings. This is because the performance of the control strategies highly depends on the prediction models, which can be developed easily in a room or a low/medium-rise building. For example, some researchers developed the room model based on the physical principles (e.g. heat transfer) or simplified resistance/capacitance dynamical equations in the references [23\u201327]. Zhang et al. [23] established a room thermal model and an energy model of the mechanical ventilation and chiller system for the night mechanical ventilation control. The results showed that this control method could reduce about 47% of total electricity consumption. Some researchers utilized building simulation programs, which are also based on physical principles, such as IDA-ICE or TRNSYS [21,22]. Bakhtiari et al. [22] established a thermal model for a low-rise building using IDA-ICE simulation program to assess the effects of mechanical night ventilation with a fixed schedule on energy savings. It was found that night ventilation can reduce around 40% cooling related energy consumption. However, it is difficult to establish such a detailed model for high-rise buildings [17], since it requires many parameters, such as the building envelope, HVAC systems, weather data, internal heat gain, etc. The establishment of a detailed model is time-consuming, and may be inaccurate due to the uncertain inputs [28]. Also, to the best of our knowledge, there are no previous studies that assessed the influence of climate change on the mechanical VC. Considering that climate change (i.e. outdoor conditions) has a significant influence on natural VC energy performance [29], and mechanical VC energy performance also depends on outdoor conditions, it is necessary to evaluate the impact of climate change on the mechanical VC regarding long-term energy performance. Our previous study proposed an optimal control strategy for a high-rise cooling system with VC based on an energy consumption model [30], where the building cooling load is a measured input rather than predicted. In practice, to achieve predictive control, there is a need to develop an accurate model to predict building cooling load and integrate it into the optimal control strategy. As seen in the previous studies in low/medium-rise buildings [21,23,27,31], the cooling load prediction model, which refers to the physics-based model, can rely on physical principles, e.g. the heat and mass balance equation. Compared with the physics-based model, the data-driven model is less complex yet still accurate for high-rise buildings [28]. Recently, machine learning (ML) techniques have been frequently used to predict building cooling load as a data-driven approach [32\u201336]. For example, Kwok et al. [33] explored using an ML model, called multi-layer perceptron model, to predict building cooling load by considering the building occupancy rate, which proved to be accurate. The root-mean-square-percentage-error can be as low as 12%, and the occupancy rate plays a critical role in the accuracy of building cooling load prediction. Ngo [34] developed many ML models using a dataset of 243 buildings, and found that the ML models were consistent with the measured data. The mean absolute percentage error of the best ML model (artificial neural networks) can be as low as 6.17%. However, there is no consensus on the ML predictor [35,37]. The accuracy of ML prediction highly depends on many factors, such as the quality of input data, data preparation methods, etc. Therefore, instead of using one best ML model from previous studies, it is recommended to examine a number of different models and find the most appropriate one [35]. In summary, there are two research gaps in the previous studies about the design and control strategy of mechanical VC. The first gap is that the control strategies of the previous studies are too difficult to implement in high-rise buildings. The previous control strategies are based on the physics-based models that are difficult to develop for high-rise buildings. To get the accurate results, physics-based models require too many parameters to be measured in high-rise buildings, such as the envelope thermal properties [17,38]. The second gap is that the design and control strategies from the previous studies were only evaluated under historical/typical weather conditions. Considering the lifetime of high-rise buildings can be more than 50 years, the performance of mechanical VC should be evaluated by considering the impacts of climate change. To fill in these gaps, this study aims to (1) develop an optimal control strategy for high-rise VC based on a machine learning prediction model of building cooling load (to fill the first research gap). This control strategy can be more applicable in high-rise buildings than the previous strategies because it is based on a data-driven model and does not require all details of the high-rise building; (2) evaluate the energy performance of the mechanical VC system with the optimal control method under typical meteorological weather and long-term climate change conditions (to fill the second research gap). This paper could guide to the high-rise mechanical VC design and the operation. First, nine different ML models (section 2.1) were evaluated and an ML model was selected. Next, using the predicted cooling load from the selected ML model, the energy model, where the fresh air flow rate is an adjustable variable, was used to calculate cooling related energy consumption. This energy model was then applied in the optimum control method to minimize the energy consumption by making full use of mechanical VC (section 2.2). Meanwhile, the typical meteorological weather data and the method to create long-term climate change weather data were introduced (section 2.3). To demonstrate this approach, a 16-storey institutional high-rise building with a Building Automation System (BAS) in Montreal (Canada) was selected in the case study (section 2.4). The measured data from BAS were used to establish and validate the ML model and energy model (section 3.1 and 3.2). Last, the energy performance of the mechanical VC system with the optimal control method was assessed under typical meteorological weather and long-term climate change conditions (section 3.3). 2 Methodology 2.1 Machine learning model for building cooling load prediction The method for selecting an ML model for predicting building cooling load is shown in Fig. 1 . This method has three major steps: 1) prepare the data for training ML models; 2) develop nine models for predicting building cooling load using the nine potential prediction algorithms; 3) Compare the results of these nine models and determine the most accurate model. Subsections 2.1.1 and 2.1.2 present an overview of the data preparation and introduction of these nine ML algorithms. The results based on data from the case study are provided in section 3.1. 2.1.1 Data preparation Data preparation includes input variable selection (also called feature extraction) and data preprocessing. An ML model predicts the cooling load based on a set of variables. The selection of inputs is usually the first and most important step of a data-driven cooling load prediction model [32]. Although there are different approaches to input variable selection, there is no best approach [28]. In this study, the outdoor dry-bulb temperature, outdoor relative humidity, wind speed, wind direction, solar radiation, fresh air flow rate, and time variables were selected as inputs. Previous studies have proven that when the construction of the building is completed, the material and design of the construction are unchangeable. Thus, the factors that can influence cooling load are the outdoor climate parameters and internal heat gain (i.e. the occupancy rate and the use of equipment) [39,40]. The climate parameters include the dry-bulb temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation, wind speed, and wind direction, which influence the building cooling load [32,41]. The variation of the internal heat gain can be taken into account by using time variables, indicating that the occupancy schedule can be fixed and correlated with time [32]. Five variables were selected to present the time, including month, day, hour, minute, and weekday. The \u2018Month\u2019, \u2018Day\u2019, \u2018Hour\u2019, \u2018Minute\u2019 and \u2018Weekday\u2019 variables are formatted as numerical variables, the ranges of which are 1 ~ 12, 1 ~ 31, 0 ~ 23, 0 ~ 54, 0 ~ 6 respectively. It should be noted that the \u2018Minute\u2019 variable only has the range from 0 to 54 because the minimal time interval in the data collection is 6 min (see Section 2.4.1). The fresh airflow rates are also selected as an input because fresh airflow rates based on demand-controlled ventilation can reflect the occupancy rates [42]. Since an ML algorithm requires data to train and generate a cooling load prediction model, data preprocessing is a vital step in generating an ML model; it aims to improve the quality of input data and thus improve the ML model\u2019s prediction accuracy [35]. Data preprocessing includes data cleaning and data transformation. Since the missing data and outliers in the data will influence the model\u2019s accuracy prediction, removal of outliers and datasets with missing data is crucial. In a study conducted by Xiao et al. it was found that when the percentage of outliers is higher than 15% of the training data, the accuracy of the neural network model (an ML model) will decrease significantly [43]. Data transformation is the preparation of data into a suitable format that can be identified by the ML models, e.g. transforming categorical data into numerical data. 2.1.2 Prediction techniques Nine prediction techniques were used in this study to predict the building cooling load: linear regression, ridge regression, elastic net (ELN), support vector machine regression (SVR), Gradient Tree Boosting (GTB), multilayer perceptron (MLP), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Although many techniques for predicting cooling load have been developed and evaluated in previous studies [35,39], there is no consensus as to which technique is the best. Therefore, both an evaluation of and comparison among the different techniques are required. These nine ML techniques have been investigated in many previous studies and have shown great potential in ensuring prediction accuracy [32\u201335]. Linear regression, ridge regression, and ELN are all linear techniques, which have often been used as a benchmark in previous studies [32]. A linear model makes a prediction by simply computing a weighted sum of the input features. Ridge regression is a regularized version of linear regression, which adds a regularization term to the cost function [44]. ELN can be regarded as an extended version of the linear technique, which also adds a regularization term modified from ridge regression and Lasso regression (which is similar to ridge regression but uses a different regularization term) to the cost function [44]. The degree of modification can be controlled by the mix ratio, which is set as 0.7 in this study. The SVR model has been successfully used for building cooling load prediction in previous studies [36,39]. SVR introduces a kernel function to conduct regression, which can map the input space to a high-dimensional space and perform a linear regression in this high-dimensional space. In this study, the linear kernel function is used. Gradient Tree Boosting (GTB) or Gradient Boosted Decision Trees is one of the ensemble methods that combines the predictions from several base estimators in order to improve the generalizability or robustness over a single estimator. The previous studies found that the ensemble methods performs well in predicting building energy consumption and building cooling loads [35,37]. MLP is one of the artificial neural network (ANN) models and has been widely adopted in engineering applications to estimate the cooling load of a building [33,45]. The MLP model consists of a number of neurons that are arranged in three kinds of layers: input layer, hidden layers (can be more than one), output layer. Each neuron in the same layer can be a multi-input\u2013single-output computational unit and is connected to the neurons in adjacent layers. In this study, the MLP model has one hidden layer with 50 neutrons in the hidden layer, which is an optimum number of neutrons per layer. The recurrent neural network (RNN) is a specially designed ANN to model the sequential data (i.e., the sequence of data is important) [46]. The essence of RNN is to remember the values of the previous time steps, which are used as the inputs for the next step. However, when the sequence of data is too long, RNNs may suffer from the problem named vanishing/exploding gradient, i.e., the RNNs cannot properly deal with the long sequence and the sequence effects will disappear. The long short term memory (LSTM) is a special form of RNN, which is used to solve vanishing/exploding gradient problem and handle very long sequential data [46]. The convolutional neural networks (CNN) consist of the neuron networks that use convolution computation as the inputs hierarchically. Although the CNN technique is often used to solve the image recognition problem, it was also applied in modeling the sequential data, such as predicting the building energy consumptions [47,48]. To justify the performance of the machine learning models, a persistence model (also called the naïve prediction method) is used. This method utilizes the measured load of the previous time step (e.g. tN ) as the prediction for the next time step (e.g. tN+1 ), which can have comparable prediction performance in forecasting time-series prediction problems [35,49]. All these ML techniques mentioned above can be found in the two machine learning libraries written in Python programming language, Scikit-Learn and Keras [50,51]. Considering that model optimization is one of the most essential steps in developing ML models, the hyperparameters in these ML models were optimized using the grid search method. Grid search is a popular method to optimize the hyperparameters [52], which can exhaustively search over the candidates to find the optimal hyperparameters. The grid search tool is provided by Scikit-Learn, GridSearchCV. Since different ML models have different types of hyperparameters, the important hyperparameters and their search range were selected from the references or the ML libraries constraints (i.e. the constraints in Scikit-Learn and Keras) [32,35,50,51,53]. The details of the searched ranges and the selected hyperparameters are summarized in Table 1 . Linear regression does not have any hyperparameter. The hyperparameter in Ridge regression is Alpha. The hyperparameters of the ELN model are Alpha and L1 ratio. The SVR model has three hyperparameters, kernel function, C, and epsilon. For GTB, four hyperparameters were selected to be optimized, including the total tree number, tree depth, the number of variables for tree splitting, and learning rate. For the MLP model, the structure of the hidden layers and activation functions were optimized. The structures of the RNN and LSTM models are adjusted from the references [35,53]. The RNN or LSTM model have a simple RNN layer or a LSTM layer and a fully connected layer (also called dense layer) that interprets the features extracted by the RNN/LSTM part. For RNN/LSTM model, the epochs (determine the training model times) and the neurons number in the RNN/LSTM and in the dense layer are optimized. The structures of the CNN models are adjusted from reference [53], which has a 1-D convolution layer with 64 filters, a MaxPooling1D layer with pool size equaling two, a flatten layer, and a common multilayer perceptron layer. The kernel size of the 1-D convolution layer, the neurons number in the dense layer, and epochs are optimized. To avoid overfitting (i.e. the hyperparameters were tuned to make the models have a good accuracy on the training dataset but have a bad accuracy on the test dataset), 20% of 1-hour training data set (i.e. measured data from Apr. to Aug. 2019 in section 2.4.1) were randomly removed when doing hyperparameter optimization [32]. 80% of 1-hour training data are used to find the best hyper-parameters by using the grid search method; then train the models with the whole training dataset. With these parameters, most of the results of nine ML models (presented in section 3.1) satisfy the accuracy criteria of the ASHRAE guideline-14 [54], regarding coefficient of variation of the root mean square error (CV(RMSE)) and Normalized Mean Bias Error (NMBE). The establishment and prediction of ML models can take several seconds or minutes for the case study using a computer with Intel Core i7-8700 Processor. 2.2 Optimum control strategy for ventilative cooling To achieve mechanical VC, the optimal control strategy requires the energy simulation of a cooling system for which an optimal control strategy can be developed. Our previous study introduced the energy model and the control method in detail [30], which are introduced briefly here in sections 2.2.1 and 2.2.2. 2.2.1 Energy model A chiller cooling system and a mechanical ventilation system are presented in Fig. 2 . The chiller cooling system consists of the chillers, cooling towers and pumps. The mechanical ventilation system includes the supply and exhaust fans, which can be used for VC when the outdoor conditions (i.e. outdoor temperature and humidity) are suitable. Relationship among building cooling load ( Q CL ), chiller cooling load ( Q c ), and thermal load of fresh air ( Q oa ): (1) Q CL = Q c - Q oa The thermal load of the fresh air, Q oa , is calculated by: (2) Q oa = V ̇ a ρ a [ c p T oa - T ia + h g ( W oa - W ia ) ] = V ̇ a ρ a ( c p Δ T + h g Δ W ) where c p is specific heat of air, kJ/(kg۰K); V ̇ a is the supplied fresh airflow rate (m3/s); ρ a is air density, kg/m3; T oa and T ia are the outdoor and indoor air temperatures, °C; W ia and W oa are the outdoor and indoor humidity ratio, kg/kgdry; h g is the latent heat of vaporization water, kJ/kgdry, which equals to 2501 + 1.805 T ia , o a [19]. T ia , o a is the average indoor and outdoor temperature, °C. The cooling system only removes latent heat of fresh air when outdoor humidity is higher than humidity setpoint. When the outdoor temperature ( T oa ) and humidity ratio ( W oa ) is lower than the indoor temperature ( T ia , e.g., 23 °C in case study, section 2.4.3) and humidity setpoint (e.g., 0.0116 kg/kgdry in the case study, section 2.4.3), the fresh air can provide free cooling, i.e. VC. The cooling capacity of VC, Q VC , equals to the part ( - V ̇ a ρ a c p Δ T ) in Eq. (2). The energy consumption of fans can be estimated by the air flow rates. (3) P F = ∑ i N F P F , n o m , i ( R F , i ) 3 = ∑ i N P P F , n o m , i ( V ̇ F , i V ̇ F , n o m , i ) 3 where P F , n o m , i is the nominal power consumed by the i th fan, kW; R F , i is the ratio of rotation speed to rated rotation speed of the i th fan; V ̇ F , i and V ̇ F , n o m , i are, respectively, the flow rate and nominal flow rate of the i th fan, m3/s. Eq. (3) also is applied to calculated the pump power, P P , and cooling tower fan power, P CT . The COP value of chillers can be calculated by: (4) 1 COP i = α 0 , i + α 1 , i 1 Q c , i + α 2 , i Q c , i + α 3 , i T ci , i Q c , i + α 4 , i T ci , i 2 Q c , i + α 5 , i T ci , i + α 6 , i Q c , i T ci , i + α 7 , i T ci , i 2 + α 8 , i Q c , i T ci , i 2 where Q c , i is the cooling load of the i th chiller, kW; T ci , i is the water temperature of the i th condenser inlet, °C; α 0 , i α 8 , i are the correlation coefficients and obtained through correlation based on the measured data. For the i th chiller, the condenser inlet water temperature, T ci , i , is estimated by: (5) T ci , i = β 0 , i + β 1 , i T wb + β 2 , i T wb 2 + β 3 , i Q c , i + β 4 , i Q c , i 2 where β 0 β 4 are the correlation coefficients. With the calculated COP, the total power of the chillers ( P CH ) can be obtained by: (6) P CH = ∑ i N CH Q c , i COP i For the pumps, P P using Eq. (3) and the water flow rate is obtained by: (7) V ̇ w , i = γ 0 , i + γ 1 , i Q c , i + γ 2 , i Q c , i 2 + γ 3 , i Q c , i 3 where γ 0 , i γ 3 , i are the correlation coefficients for the ith water pump. To obtain cooling tower fan power, P CT using Eq. (3), the ratio of the rotation speed of the cooling tower fan to the maximum rotation speed, R CT , is required, which is determined by the temperature of water leaving the cooling tower (i.e. the inlet water temperature Tci,i ): (8) R CT , i = d 0 , i T ci , i + d 1 , i where d 0 , i and d 1 , i are the correlation coefficients for the ith cooling tower. 2.2.2 Optimal control strategy The objective of the VC optimal control strategy is to optimize the total energy consumption of the whole cooling system (i.e. chiller cooling + VC). The problem can be mathematically formulated as the following equation. (9) J = m i n P total = m i n P CH + P P + P F + P CT where J is the electric power of all the components in the cooling systems. According to Eq. (1) ~ Eq. (8), P CH is determined by Qc and Tci ; PP is determined by Qc ; PF is determined by V ̇ a ; PCT is determined by Tci ; Eq. (9) is subjected to (10a) V ̇ IAQ ≤ V ̇ a ≤ V ̇ nom (10b) Q c , m i n · Z ≤ Q c · Z ≤ Q c , n o m (10c) T oa , m i n ≤ T oa ≤ T oa , m a x (10d) W oa ≤ W oa , m a x where V ̇ nom and V ̇ IAQ are the total nominal fresh airflow rate of the mechanical ventilation system and the minimum fresh airflow rate required to maintain IAQ, m3/s; Q c , n o m and Q c , m i n are the maximum and minimum chiller cooling capacity, kW; Z represents the chiller working state (Z = 1: chiller works; Z = 0: chiller does not work). T oa , m i n , T oa , m a x , and W oa , m a x are the temperature and humidity ratio setpoints to ensure that the control strategy fulfills the thermal comfort, which means that the VC control strategy can only be applied when the outdoor air temperature and humidity ratio are within the constraints. Otherwise, VC cannot be used. The cost function, Eq. (9), shows that the total energy consumption, P total , can be converted to a function that relates to the supplied fresh airflow rate, V ̇ a , with multiple constraints, Eqs. (10a) ~ (10d). The energy consumption of fans, P F , is directly related to fresh airflow rate, V ̇ a . All the energy consumption of chiller, P CH , pumps, P P , and cooling towers, P CT can be calculated after obtaining the values of the building cooling load, Q CL , outdoor wet-bulb temperature, T wb , indoor-outdoor temperature difference, Δ T , and fresh airflow rate, V ̇ a (the details are listed in Eq. (1) ~ (8)). The building cooling load, outdoor wet-bulb temperature, and indoor-outdoor temperature difference are the known variables. Therefore, the fresh airflow rate, V ̇ a , is the only adjustable variable that determines the optimal total energy consumption, J . The energy model and the optimization problem are programmed using Matlab. The exhaustive search algorithm (or Brute-force algorithm) [55,56] was selected to solve the optimization problem. The exhaustive search algorithm will enumerate all possible inputs (i.e. discrete V ̇ a in the constraint V ̇ IAQ ≤ V ̇ a ≤ V ̇ nom ) for the outputs (i.e. P total ) and find the V ̇ a which can contribute to J . The exhaustive search algorithm has been widely applied in the optimization of HVAC system for achieving minimum energy consumption [55,56]. Solving the cost function Eq. (9) to get the optimal values of ventilation rates and energy consumption takes around one minute for the case study using a computer with Intel Core i7-8700 Processor. 2.3 Weather data To evaluate the energy performance of mechanical VC under typical meteorological and long-term climate change conditions, the weather data are required. Since the case study building is in Montreal (see section 2.4), the weather data for Montreal in the Canadian Weather Year for Energy Calculation (CWEC) 2016 are used as the typical meteorological weather data. CWEC was developed by the Canada Engineering Climate Services Unit [57], To generate the future hourly weather data, the morphing method with the HadCM3 (Hadley Centre Atmospheric Model version 3) model is used, which was widely applied in previous studies [29,58\u201360]. HadCM3 is a grid point model that divides the lands and oceans into cells (2.5° in latitude and 3.75° in longitude over land) and predicts monthly climate change in each cell [61]. Although the grid point of HadCM3 does not coincide exactly at the location of Montreal, the linear interpolation from the four closest grid points can be used to obtain the monthly climate change [29]. The following paragraphs introduce the scenarios of climate change and the method to obtain the future hourly weather data. In this study, two CO2 emission scenarios (A1FI and A2) and two periods (year 2040 ~ 2069 (2050 s) and year 2070\u20132099 (2080 s)) in the HadCM3 model were considered as the long-term climate weather data. A1FI describes a future world of rapid development and high CO2 emission, while A2 indicates a future heterogeneous world with mild CO2 emission [62]. The time periods are chosen based on the assumption that a building can last about 50 years [59]. Therefore, the four long-term weather conditions are 2050 s A2, 2050 s A1FI, 2080 s A2, and 2080 s A1FI. The detailed monthly change data of dry-bulb temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation in HadCM3 can be found on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) website [63]. HadCM3 can only provide valid and reliable monthly changes. To calculate hourly energy consumption, the monthly changes must be downscaled to hourly changes. Here the morphing method is used for the downscaling, which contains three formulas to combine the typical meteorological year\u2019s weather data with the monthly change [64]. The three formulas are named: shift, scratch, and shift and scratch, as shown in the following equations (11), (12), and (13) respectively. (11) x = x 0 + Δ x m (12) x = a m x 0 (13) x = x 0 + Δ x m + a m ( x 0 - 〈 x 0 〉 m ) where x represents the future climate parameters, x 0 is the existing climate parameters, Δ x m is the absolute change in monthly mean climate parameters for the month m , a m is the fractional change in monthly mean climate variable for the month m , and 〈 x 0 〉 m is the monthly mean value for the existing month m . In this study, four parameters, dry-bulb temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation are considered as the inputs in the ML models. For the future hourly dry-bulb temperature, the shift and scratch method should be used. The fractional change a m can be calculated as (14) a m = Δ T max , m - Δ T min , m 〈 T o a 0 , m a x 〉 m - 〈 T o a 0 , m i n 〉 m where Δ T max , m and Δ T min , m are the monthly mean changes in daily maximum temperature and minimum temperature, which can be obtained from HadCM3. 〈 T o a 0 , m a x 〉 m and 〈 T o a 0 , m i n 〉 are the monthly mean values in daily maximum temperature and minimum temperature, ℃. The shift method can be used to calculate the future relative humidity. The absolute fractional change of relative humidity can be obtained from HadCM3 directly. The scratch method can be used to obtain the future solar radiation and wind speed. The fractional change a m should be calculated as (15) a m = 1 + Δ x m 〈 x 0 〉 m where Δ x m is the monthly mean change in solar irradiance, W·h/m2, or wind speed, m/s, and 〈 x 0 〉 m is the current monthly mean solar irradiance or wind speed. According to the reference [65], it can be assumed that the future wind direction and fresh air flow rate are unchanged, and these data can be found in the CWEC and the BAS system (see section 2.4). The hourly weather data of four future weather conditions were generated by Eqs. (11)~(15) with the CWEC typical weather data. The results of the A2 scenario were obtained with the help of a tool called climate change world weather file generator [66]. 2.4 Case study A 16-storey high-rise institutional building with a 38,000 m2 air-conditioned area in Montreal (Canada) was chosen for the case study, which was used to generate and validate the ML models and mathematical energy models. During workdays, the building is occupied between 5:00 and 24:00. The indoor air temperature normally is maintained at 23 °C in summer. The mechanical system, including a centralized chiller cooling system and a mechanical ventilation system, is located on the 16th floor. The chiller cooling system contains a centrifugal chiller (with a chilled water pump and a cooling water pump), a scroll chiller (with a chilled water pump and two cooling water pumps), a backup screw chiller, and two cooling towers. The chiller cooling system operates when the outdoor temperature is higher than 15 °C. The mechanical ventilation system contains four supply air fans and four exhaust air fans to maintain IAQ based on the occupants\u2019 demand and keep the building in positive pressure. The detail information of the components in the mechanical systems can be found in our previous article [30]. All the components are controlled by the Building Automation System (BAS). BAS also records all the data of the HVAC systems, including building cooling load, outdoor air conditions, and amount of fresh air, etc. The data in BAS were recorded at three different time steps, 6 mins, 30 mins and 1 h. The air and water temperature sensors have the accuracy of ± 0.19 ℃ at 21 ℃. The accuracy of the air flow rate sensors is ± 3% of reading. Using the second affinity law, the water flow rate is calculated based on the measured water pressure, the measuring accuracy of which is ± 0.075%. To check the reliability of BAS sensor measurements, the affinity laws (Eq. (3)) were applied to verify the measured data on variable speed ventilation fans and the variable speed pump data in August 2019. The CV(RMSE) (defined in Eq. (16)) between the measured and predicted powers varies from 3% to 14% for the ventilation fans, and from 3% to 5% for the chilled water cooling water pumps [30]. Therefore, the BAS sensor measurement is reliable considering the complexity of the cooling systems. 2.4.1 Data for generating machine learning models In order to train the ML algorithms and generate ML models, seven months of data in BAS (from April to October 2019) and Montreal historical weather data were used. The BAS system provides the fresh air flow rate, outdoor temperature, relative humidity, and building cooling load data. The Montreal historical weather data, including wind speed, wind direction, and solar irradiance, is provided by Environment and Climate Change Canada [67]. The data between April and August were used to generate the ML models, and the data in September and October were used for the validation. Since the recorded data in BAS have three different time steps (6 mins, 30 mins and 1 h), the influence of time steps on prediction accuracy was also studied. Compared with the other ML models that only use the current conditions, the RNN, LSTM, and CNN models require both the current conditions and historical conditions as inputs (i.e. the conditions in the previous steps). For example, to predict the cooling load at tN , the RNN, LSTM, and CNN models not only need the conditions at tN , but also the historical conditions, i.e., tN-1 , tN-2 , tN-3 , etc. The previous studies found that the used historical conditions varied from 1 h to 24 h [35,47,48], depending on the time resolution (i.e., the length of time steps) of the dataset. In this study, there are three different time steps (6 mins, 30 mins and 1 h) for the datasets. To avoid too many or too few inputs, the current conditions and two previous hours historical data were selected as inputs for RNN, LSTM, and CNN models. To enhance the reliability of the training (see section 2.1.1), the recorded data in BAS and Montreal historical weather data were preprocessed (i.e. cleaning and transformation) before training. To clean the data, only the data recorded when the chiller system was operating (i.e. outdoor air temperature was higher than 15 ℃) were reserved. Then, the outliers of building cooling load were detected using the interquartile range rule. The interquartile range is the difference between the third quartile (i.e. Q3) and the first quartile (i.e. Q1). The lower limit and the upper limit are defined as Q1 − 1.5(Q3 − Q1) and Q3 + 1.5(Q3 − Q1), respectively. Any variables beyond the range defined by these two limit values are regarded as outliers and removed. The data transformation was conducted in the parameter of wind direction, which was recorded in the \u201ccompass\u201d style (e.g. using the categorical data \u201cNNE\u201d to present north-northeast wind) instead of numeric data as in the Montreal historical weather data. After data preparation, 22285, 4282, 2036 data sets were used for the 6-min, 30-min, and 1-hour time steps, respectively. After the training, the ML models were evaluated by the measured data in September and October 2019 from BAS. To compare the prediction accuracy, the predicted building cooling loads from the model trained using 6-min and 30-min time step data were converted to hourly average data (i.e. obtaining 1-hour data). The results are presented in section 3.1. This study implements the interquartile range rule as outlier detection. After testing the effects of the outlier detection, it was found that using interquartile range rule as outliner identification only influences the prediction results from the 6-mins data, because only 6-mins data have 27 outliers (1-h and 30-mins time steps do not have any outliers). Due to the 27 outliers, the prediction accuracy of the some ML models slightly decreases. For example, the CV(RMSE) of the GTB and Ridge model increase to 12.9% from 12.7% and 19.2% from 19.1%. Therefore, the outlier detection based on interquartile range rule can improve the accuracy of some ML models on the prediction of building cooling load. 2.4.2 Data for energy model correlation and validation Coefficients for establishing the VC energy models were correlated using the August 2019 data from BAS. The values of the correlation coefficients of Eqs. (4), (5), (7) and (8) refer to our previous study [30]. The model was validated by comparing the predicted electricity consumption and measured data of September and October 2019 from BAS. The results are presented in section 3.2. 2.4.3 Case design for energy performance study To evaluate the energy performance of mechanical VC, six cases (one reference case and five cases with different mechanical ventilation system settings) were proposed and listed in Table 2 . These cases are named: CH, VC 1.5, VC 3, VC 6, VC 10, and EF. Case CH is the reference case, which means the settings of this case are completely the same as the settings of the actual building in operation (mechanical ventilation is designed for maintaining indoor air quality and VC is not applied). Our previous study proved that to save energy by VC, energy efficient fans are necessary but there exists an optimal fan flow rate (when the flow rate is higher than the optimal value, the cooling system cannot save more energy) [30]. Therefore, cases VC 1.5 to 10 were proposed in this study, which combine VC optimal control, energy efficient fans, and increased nominal fan flow rates. In the optimal control strategy, the outdoor temperature setpoint range for VC is set as 15℃ ~ 23℃. This range is based on the temperature at which the chiller system begins functioning (when the outdoor temperature is higher than 15℃) and the indoor air temperature setpoint (23℃) in the case study. According to the reference determined in the study of hybrid ventilation conducted by Yuan et al. [5], the humidity ratio setpoint can be set as 11.6 g/kgdry, which satisfies the thermal comfort requirement. Energy efficient fans refer to fans that can consume less energy to transport the unit amount of air than the common fan. In this building, the specific fan power ((SFP): the ratio of the nominal electric power of both supply and exhaust fans to fresh air flow rate) of the existing ventilation systems is 3.76 kW/m3/s. The SFP of the energy efficient fans for the ventilation system in Table 2 is 0.86 kW/m3/s, which is the SFP required by the Chinese Standard for the fresh air ventilation system [68]. The numbers, 1.5 ~ 10, in cases VC 1.5 ~ VC 10 indicate the increased fan rate time compared with the existing ventilation system in the case study. The nominal fan rate of the existing fresh air fans is 35.7 m3/s. Therefore, the nominal fan rates of fresh air fans in VC 1.5 ~ 10 are 54 m3/s ~ 357 m3/s respectively. Considering that energy efficient fans can directly reduce energy consumption without VC, case EF (with energy efficient fans only) was also investigated to demonstrate the performance of VC. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Evaluation of machine learning models The data used for training ML models were collected from the BAS from April to August 2019 at three different time steps (see section 2.4.1). The building cooling loads measured in September and October 2019 were used for validation in this section. The Coefficient of Variation of Root Mean Square Error, CV(RMSE), is used here to evaluate the prediction accuracy [35]. CV(RMSE) is defined as: (16) C V R M S E = ∑ i = 1 n ( y i - y i ^ ) 2 n - 1 y - where y i and y i ^ are the measured data and predicted data; n is the number of data points; y - is the average of the measured data. The ASHRAE guideline specifies that if the resulting CV(RMSE) is below 30% when using hourly data, the model is calibrated successfully [54]. NMBE is also used here to evaluate the prediction accuracy, which is defined as (17) NMBE = ∑ i = 1 n ( y i - y ^ i ) ( n - 1 ) y - where y i and y i ^ are the measured data and predicted data; n is the number of data points; y - is the average measured data. The ASHRAE guideline specifies that if the resulting NMBE is within ± 10% when using hourly data, the model is calibrated successfully [54]. Table 3 summarizes the CV(RMSE) and NMBE of nine ML models trained using the three different time steps. It was found that GTB at 1-hour time step can predict the most accurate cooling load. The corresponding CV(RMSE) and NMBE are 12.3% and 1.2% which are lower than the hourly constraints of the ASHRAE guideline, i.e. 30% of CV (RMSE) and ± 10% of NMBE [54]. The CV(RMSE)s and NMBEs of the ELN, linear, ridge, and SVR models are similar, which are around 19.0 ~ 20.6% and within ± 3% respectively at three different time steps. When the time step changes from 1-hour to 6-mins, the CV(RMSE)s and NMBE of MLP models change from 19.5% to 16.8% and from −2.6% to 3.7% respectively. All the CV(RMSE)s of RNN and LSTM model at the three time steps are lower than 20%. The CV(RMSE) and NMBE of the CNN built by 1 h are 21.5% and −13.1% respectively, which is the largest CV(RMSE) and lowest NMBE among all the ML models. The CV(RMSE) and NMBE of the persistence model decrease significantly when the time steps change from 1 h to 6 mins, which are 2.2% and −0.2% respectively for the 6 mins time step. Since the variation of building cooling load with 6 mins time step is usually much less than that with 1 h-time step, the persistence model can benefit a lot from the shrink of the time step. Most ML models built by 6 mins or 30 mins time step data do not have CV(RMSE) and NMBE as low as the Persistence model. However, most ML models built by 1 h-step have the CV(RMSE)s and NMBEs better than those of the Persistence model. These results show that the ML models have a good performance on the hourly cooling load prediction. Fig. 3 presents the hourly predicted and measured building cooling loads for nine different ML models (at 1-hour time step). The shadowy part represents the 20% deviation range from the measured value, which is the relative difference and is chosen from ASHRAE guideline 14-Annex C [54]. Fig. 3 (a) ~ (d), (f), and (g) show that the linear, ELN, ridge, SVR, MLP, and RNN models have similar prediction results that usually are lower than the measured values. Fig. 3 (e) indicates the prediction results of GTB model are very close to the measured data. Fig. 3 (h) and (i) present that the LSTM and CNN models can capture the variation of building cooling load but sometimes LSTM and CNN models overestimate the building cooling load. Overall, the largest discrepancy of prediction results in all models is within ± 20% of the measured results most of the time. Considering the GTB model with the 1-hour time step predicts the most accurate cooling load (see Table 3 and Fig. 3(e)), it is selected for the optimal control in the case study. This study evaluated the accuracy of nine ML techniques on predicting building cooling load. It was found that GTB, an ensemble technique, performs the best. A similar conclusion was also found in the previous study of Wang et al. [35], who investigated the prediction performance of 12 ML techniques on building cooling load using outdoor temperature, humidity and time variables as inputs. It was found that GTB outperforms the other ML techniques (e.g. the linear regression, LSTM, etc.) in predicting the one-hour ahead cooling load. Furthermore, it can be found that in this study, the accuracy of GTB (CV(RMSE) = 12.3%) is higher than that in the reference (CV(RMSE) = 21%) [35]. One possible reason is that this study uses more weather inputs, such as solar radiation, which has much influence on building cooling load. Therefore, when predicting building cooling load, it is suggested to include solar radiations as one of the weather condition inputs. Moreover, it should be noted that the other ML techniques also show acceptable prediction accuracy, most of which can satisfy the criteria of ASHRAE Guide-14 (i.e. for hourly data CV(RMSE) ≤ 30% and NMBE ≤ ±10%) [54]. 3.2 Validation of energy model With the predicted building cooling load from the GTB model, energy consumption can be simulated by the energy models. The energy consumption values measured in September and October 2019 were used for validation in this section. Fig. 4 compares the predicted and measured energy consumption of the whole system using the 1-hour time step. The shadowy part represents the allowable 25% deviation range from the measured value, which refers to the allowable difference [69]. The measured and predicted results are very close, and the variations with time are almost the same. Most of the time (92%), the differences are less than 25%. In the previous study, Rahman et al [69] recommended that the allowable relative difference between predicted and measured energy use of the HVAC system should be around 15 ~ 25% monthly. In this study, the monthly difference between the predicted and measured energy use is around −3.5% for September and −2.7% for October, which is much less than the acceptable relative difference presented in the reference [69]. CV(RMSE) and NMBE are also used here to evaluate the prediction accuracy, which are 11.5% and −3.5%, satisfying ASHRAE guideline-14 regarding the hourly constraint, i.e. 30% and ± 10% [54]. Considering the complexity of the high-rise cooling system (three chillers, eight fans, primary and secondary pumps with variable flow rates), the accuracy of the developed models is acceptable. Therefore, the advanced model (the GTB model and energy models combined) is validated. 3.3 Case study 3.3.1 Future weather features To investigate the energy performance of the optimal control, the first step was to generate future weather data (see section 2.3). Table 4 shows the summary of the annual average value of each climate parameter and annual available hours of ventilative cooling (VC hours). VC hours refer to the number of hours when VC is available, i.e. the weather conditions are within the temperature (15 ~ 23℃) setpoints and humidity ratio setpoint (≤11.6 g/kgdry). The results indicate that the dry-bulb temperature and humidity ratio increase significantly due to climate change, but the variations of wind speed and solar irradiance change little. The annual VC hours decrease in the future. The worst future weather scenario for VC hours is 2080 s A1F1 (the period 2070 ~ 2099 with a high CO2 emission scenario), where the hours reduce around 30% (from 1693 h to 1211 h). Fig. 5 shows the variation of monthly VC hours under different weather scenarios. The results show that VC hours increase during the shoulder seasons (March ~ May and October ~ November). However, the VC hours decrease during the summer seasons from June to September. The variation of the hours is different for different emission scenarios and periods. The 2080 s A1FI has the largest change. For example, the VC hours decrease 255 h in August in the 2080 s A1FI, while they increase 132 h in October. 3.3.2 Energy performance under typical and long-term climate change weather conditions This section presents and discusses the results of the ML model and VC energy model. The building cooling load simulations were conducted using the GTB model trained using 1-hour time step data under the typical and long-term climate change conditions (i.e. CWEC, 2050 s A2, 2050 s A1FI, 2080 s A2 and 2080 s A1FI). The energy consumption simulations were conducted using the VC energy model with the predicted building cooling load from the GTB model. Six cases with different VC settings (Table 2) were simulated. In both the GTB model and VC energy model, it is assumed that the fresh air flow rates remain the same as measured in the BAS system. The monthly variations of building cooling load are presented in Fig. 6 . The annual energy consumption and energy savings rates are presented in Fig. 7 . The monthly variations of energy savings are presented in Fig. 8 . Fig. 6. shows the simulation results of the monthly variation of building cooling load from March to November (cooling weather) when the outdoor air temperature is higher than 15 °C. It can be found that due to climate change, the cooling load will increase in the future. During the mild weather (April, May, September and October), there is a much higher cooling load increase than during hot weather (June, July and August) and cool weather (March and November). The 2080 s A1FI has the largest increase in building cooling load. In total, the annual cooling load is around 902 MWh higher than the typical weather condition CWEC. Fig. 7 compares the annual electricity consumption and energy saving rate of six different cases under typical weather and four long-term weather conditions. The terms \u201cVC 1.5, VC 3, VC 6, and VC 10\u201d mean that the nominal fan flow rate of cases VC 1.5 ~ VC 10 are 1.5 ~ 10 times that of Case CH. The nominal fan flow rate of each case is listed in Table 2. The energy savings rate is the ratio of energy savings (by VC 1.5 ~ VC 10 cases or EF case) to the energy consumption of the corresponding CH case (baseline case). It can be found that due to global climate change, cooling related energy consumption increases significantly. The energy consumption of the CH case increases from 592 MWh (typical weather scenario) to 1077 MWh (2080 s A1FI weather scenario). The largest energy savings by VC (i.e. VC 6 or VC 10) increase slightly from 184 MWh (CWEC typical weather scenario) to 203 MWh (2080 A1F1 weather scenario). However, the energy savings rate of VC decreases. Under the typical weather scenario, VC can reduce energy consumption by 31%, but the corresponding energy savings rate is only 19% in the 2080 s A1FI due to the high baseline energy consumption (CH case). It can be found that the different VC settings have different energy saving potential under different weather scenarios. When VC is working (i.e. the energy efficiency of VC is higher than that of chiller cooling), higher nominal ventilation rates will contribute to higher VC capacities to remove indoor excessive heat, which consumes less energy than chiller cooling. Therefore, different VC settings have different energy saving potential. Meanwhile, the weather scenarios can also influence the VC cooling capacity and the building cooling load; therefore, influence the energy savings. From Table 4, the five weather scenarios have different outdoor conditions (e.g. outdoor temperature, humidity, etc.), which directly influence VC hours (e.g. see Table 4) and energy savings. With lower outdoor temperature, the VC cooling capacity is higher according to Eq. (2), and less using of chiller cooling. Therefore, the energy saving for cooling increases. For example, the annual average outdoor temperature of weather scenario 2080 s A1F1 is 14.7 °C, while that of CWEC is 7.7 °C. Their VC hours are 1211 and 1693 respectively according to Table 4. On the other hand, due to the different outdoor conditions, the building cooling load is different (e.g. the cooling load of the case study in Fig. 6). Thus, the energy consumption for cooling, which is indicated as the Case CH in Fig. 7, is different for different weather scenarios. Therefore, different VC settings have different energy saving potential under different weather scenarios. Moreover, by comparing the energy consumption and energy saving rate, the optimal nominal fan flow rates can be determined. In CWEC, the energy saving rate of VC 6 is the same as that of VC 10, but is obviously higher than VC 3, which indicates that the nominal fan flow rate of VC 6 (i.e. 213.9 m3/s (according to Table 2)) is optimal. However, the difference of energy consumption between VC 3 and VC 6 becomes smaller in the other four future weather scenarios. In the 2080 s A1FI, when the nominal flow rate increases from 107 m3/s (VC 3) to 213.9 m3/s (VC 6), the energy consumption only reduces 6 MWh. Therefore, the nominal flow rate of VC 3 (107 m3/s) can be optimal in the 2080 s A1FI. To show the details of VC energy savings, Fig. 8 presents the monthly energy savings of five cases under five weather scenarios. It should be noted that in each weather scenario, the energy savings are calculated based on the CH case (baseline case). Fig. 8 (a) presents the energy savings of VC under the typical weather scenario (CWEC). It can be found that the energy savings appear mainly during the summertime (i.e. from June to September), which can reach 37 MWh in VC 6 and VC 10 (June). The energy savings during the shoulder seasons (i.e. from March to May and October to November) are relatively small. The maximum energy savings of VC 6 and VC 10 during the shoulder seasons reach around 23 MWh (May). From Fig. 8 (b) to (e), it can be found that the changes in energy savings over time are different, but the trend is similar for different weather scenarios. The energy savings shrink during the summertime while increase during the shoulder seasons. The energy savings of VC 6 in June decrease to 28 MWh in 2080 s A1FI, whereas they reach 31 MWh in May. These changes can be caused by the change in VC hours (see Fig. 5). VC hours means the number of hours when VC is available. Therefore, the energy performance of VC changes with available VC hours. For example, in 2080 s A1FI, there are fewer than 50 VC hours in July and August (see Fig. 5), and the results of the cases with VC are very close to case EF. The results indicate that the influence of climate change should be considered in the mechanical VC system design. The previous study has proved that there exists an optimal nominal ventilation rate for a specific building, which can make full use of fresh air for cooling [30]. This study further shows that the optimal nominal ventilation rates vary depending on the weather conditions. For example, in section 3.3.2, the selected building in Canada indicates that the optimal nominal ventilation rate changes from 213.9 m3/s for the weather scenario CWEC to 107 m3/s for the weather scenario 2080 s A1FI. Therefore, to design a mechanical VC system that could achieve maximum energy savings for a long time, both the building information and weather conditions due to climate change should be considered in order to determine the optimal nominal ventilation rate. 4 Conclusion To promote the application of mechanical VC in high-rise buildings for cooling, this study proposes an optimal control strategy based on a machine learning cooling load prediction model and energy model for building cooling systems with high-rise mechanical ventilation. The energy performance of the control strategy is assessed under typical meteorological and long-term climate change conditions. The case study was conducted in a 16-story institutional high-rise building with BAS. The measured data from the BAS system and Montreal historical weather data were used to establish and validate the ML model and the energy model. The energy performance of the VC was investigated under the typical weather conditions and climate change conditions. This study obtained the following major conclusions: (1) This study presents nine different machine learning algorithms to predict building cooling load: linear regression, ridge regression, ELN, SVR, GTB, MLP, RNN, LSTM and CNN. Different time steps were considered. The GTB model trained using 1-hour time step data is the most accurate model for predicting the building cooling load. (2) Through the validation study, it was found that with the predicted cooling load from the GTB model, the energy consumption of the cooling system in the case study can be estimated accurately using the energy model. (3) The energy performance study shows that although the energy savings rate of VC decreases due to the high building cooling load caused by climate change, the total amount of energy savings increases. (4) Optimal nominal ventilation rates exist and can vary with climate. In the case study, under the typical weather scenario, 213.9 m3/s is the optimal nominal ventilation rate and higher rates do not significantly increase energy savings. However, under the weather scenario of the 2080 s A1FI (the worst future scenario), the optimal nominal ventilation rate is 107 m3/s. (5) Under a warming climate, energy savings increase in the shoulder seasons (March ~ May and October ~ November), but energy savings decrease in the summertime (June ~ September) because of the changes in VC hours. It should be noted that the aim of this study is to propose an optimal control strategy based on building cooling load prediction using machine learning technology and to evaluate its performance. The other tasks (such as improve the prediction accuracy of ML models using advanced hyperparameters optimization, testing outlier detection rules, testing input variables, etc.) will be studied in the future. Besides that, energy storage in the thermal mass (e.g. the concrete building structure) is not included, which could be applied as a heat sink for night cooling and can contribute to more energy savings for mechanical VC. The future work will consider the thermal mass energy storage, develop a model predictive control for high-rise mechanical VC, and study it under different climate conditions in the world.

        "dc:description": "Ventilation has proved to be an effective solution for reducing building cooling load in high-rise buildings, i.e. ventilative cooling (VC), especially in cold climates. Mechanical ventilation system can achieve VC (i.e. mechanical VC) in high-rise buildings, but it needs appropriate control to reduce cooling related energy consumption and to consider the impact of climate change. This study aims to develop an optimal control method for mechanical VC and evaluate its energy performance, based on an advanced model. In this advanced model, a machine learning model was applied to predict building cooling load and energy models were developed to predict energy consumption. A case study was conducted on a real high-rise building located in Montreal (Canada). Using the measured data from the Building Automation System (BAS), the machine learning model, generated by an algorithm called Gradient tree boosting (GTB), was found to be the most accurate and was used in the optimal control method. The energy models that couple mechanical ventilation and chiller cooling were validated with the BAS measured data. Then, the optimal control method was applied to study the energy performance of mechanical VC under long-term climate conditions. The results indicate that the energy savings of mechanical VC will decrease around 16% during the summer but increase around 105% during the shoulder season due to climate change. The optimal nominal ventilation rate for mechanical VC in the typical meteorological year is twice of that in the 2080 s A1FI weather scenario.",
