The supply-demand imbalance of electricity increases the operating burden on smart grids, decreases the average efficiency of power generation equipment, and threatens the safe operation of power grids. Residential air conditioning is a flexible load and a major consumer of electricity. Therefore, demand response control can be applied to air conditioners (ACs) to shift their peak energy consumption and save energy. Model predictive control (MPC) is an effective demand response control method. In this study, we analyze the cooling seasonal performance of an inverter AC with MPC. A time-varying MPC was designed and evaluated using a simulation testbed that was constructed using MATLAB. Subsequently, the energy, cost, and temperature control performances of the MPC were analyzed in detail from electricity pricing model, weather conditions and fluctuation of real-time price. The results show that compared to the proportional\u2013integral\u2013derivative (PID) control method, MPC can shift the peak-hour energy consumption by 6.34%\u201321.60% and reduce the total electricity costs by 13.44%\u201327.43%, while maintaining indoor thermal comfort during the whole cooling season, and Demand response with MPC control is very suited to hot weather conditions with highly fluctuating RTP. By applying MPC hybrid demand response under real-time price, there are better performances on peak shifting and cost saving.

The share of renewable energy, such as wind power and photovoltaic energy, is expected to increase significantly in the future owing to the push towards carbon neutrality. Consequently, electricity supply will fluctuate and become more random, which could decrease the average efficiency of power generation, decrease the utilization of renewable electricity, and threaten the safe operation of the power grid [2,3]. To overcome these problems, all relevant aspects, including power generation, grids, storage, and use, should be considered synthetically. In terms of electricity generation, the capacity modulation range and speed of traditional electricity generation plants should be increased, and the quality and modulation of renewable electricity generation should be improved. Considering power grids, smart grid technologies should be implemented to improve dynamic transmission and distribution capabilities. Energy storage systems, including electricity storage, cooling storage, and heating storage, should be properly designed and employed to reduce the discrepancy between the supply and demand of electricity [3,4]. Moreover, the flexibility of electricity demand should be increased by shifting demand from peak periods to valley periods [5]. Buildings are responsible for a significant proportion of global electricity consumption, with air conditioning systems being a major contributor to the total building energy demand [6]. On hot days or in hot regions, the electricity required for air-conditioning further increases the peak power demand. For example, on extremely hot days, space cooling can use more than 25% of the peak electricity demand in the United States. In Singapore, air conditioning can account for as much as 50% of the peak electricity load, which is quite similar to that in Beijing [7]. Fortunately, air conditioning is a flexible load. By exploiting room thermal inertia, the electricity demand for cooling can be reduced significantly, without affecting temperature control [8]. The energy consumption of residential buildings accounts for a big share in the total buildings\u2019 global final energy use [9], and the residential buildings have the highest demand response (DR) potential [10]. The IEA predicts that 5.6 billion ACs will be used in buildings by 2050, up from 1.6 billion today [7]. Therefore, studying the DR control of ACs is extremely important for future electricity distribution systems. Several studies have focused on the DR management of residential ACs. Based on the type of response signal, DR can be classified into two categories: incentive-based DR and price-based DR. In incentive-based DR, consumers are directly incentivized by the electric power company to change their electricity consumption limits, according to a pre-agreed protocol. In price-based DR, consumers voluntarily change their consumption patterns in accordance with dynamic electricity prices. Incentive-based DR is primarily used for large electricity consumers, such as industries, as the agreements need to be signed in advance. Price-based DR is more suitable for large-scale small-capacity users, such as residential users with ACs. Currently, the electricity pricing models used in price-based DR primarily include time-of-use (TOU) pricing model and real-time price (RTP) model. Compared to TOU price, wherein electricity prices can jump between two or three projected prices over an entire day with an interval of several hours, RTP modulates electricity prices in minutes to respond to fluctuations in the electricity market. Consequently, RTP has significant potential in real-time DR. In general, two types of control methods are used to realize price-based DR. The first is rule-based control, the operation of the electricity is directly controlled based on the real-time price of electricity. Yoon et al. [11] developed a price-responsive controller for residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, wherein temperature set-points are assigned if the retail price exceeds a preset price. The second is optimization-based control, wherein optimal control methods are used to minimize electricity costs over a given time span under variable prices. Thomas et al. [12] designed an intelligent residential AC controller formulated as a stochastic dynamic program to respond to both energy prices and randomly varying environmental conditions, to realize the trade-offs between cost and optimal comfort by scheduling the switching on or off of an AC. Hu et al. [13] investigated a model-based genetic optimization control method that is an open-loop control method for inverter ACs to realize electricity cost savings and peak power reductions in a dynamic electricity price environment. Comparison of the two types of control methods [14,15] has revealed that the optimization-based approach can significantly decrease the total energy consumption and cost, whereas the rule-based approach provides a large reduction in the peak electricity demand. Consequently, a combination of optimization-based control and rule-based control, which can be called hybrid control, may further improve the performance of DR. The aforementioned cases of price-based DR are primarily realized through real-time feedback control or model-based open-loop optimal control. It is difficult to achieve maximum cost saving over a given time span with real-time feedback control as it only uses the currently available information and does not include future information. Owing to the errors of thermal load prediction and the system models, the operation of open-loop optimal control also deviates from the optimal condition. Model predictive control (MPC) can shift peak electricity in response to dynamic electricity price using an optimization algorithm, realize multiple disturbances, multiple objections, and big-time lag system optimal control, and decrease prediction errors by using a model-based feedback method. Therefore, MPC can be implemented in residential ACs for better DR control [16]. Several studies have reported significant improvements in energy saving, cost saving, and peak shifting by adopting optimization-based DR using MPC, which can be shortened to MPC-optimization DR (MoD), or hybrid DR using MPC, which can be shortened to MPC-hybrid DR (MhD), in residential ACs. In MhD, the indoor temperature setting or compressor frequency is directly adjusted in response to the dynamic price to further strengthen the peak-cutting performance. Mesut et al. [17] proposed a practical cost and energy-efficient MPC strategy for single-speed ACs under RTP and developed an algorithm that assigns temperature set-points in response to RTP. The results demonstrated that compared to on/off control, MPC achieved reductions of 44.2% and 43.3% in the total energy consumption and energy costs, respectively, during peak hours. Compared to fixed-speed ACs, inverter ACs have higher efficiency under part-load conditions and a higher thermal sensation, and are widely used in household ACs [18]. Therefore, Hu et al. [19] designed an MhD to optimally control an inverter AC under a dynamic RTP and limited the operating frequency of the inverter AC in response to the electricity price. The simulation results showed that compared to a PID controller, the MhD control reduced the average power consumption during peak demand periods by 17.31%\u201338.86%. However, it should be noted that compulsively constricting the working frequency of the compressor can threaten the safety of the compressor and dramatically increase the indoor air temperature beyond the comfortable range. Moreover, most existing studies using MPC in ACs were conducted over a few days, during which disturbances such as the outdoor air temperature, solar radiation, and dynamic price remained relatively stable. Consequently, the cooling seasonal performance of ACs with MPC is still unclear. To bridge these research gaps, the cooling seasonal performance of an inverter air conditioner with MPC for DR is investigated herein. The effects of disturbances, such as the outdoor air temperature, solar radiation, dynamic price fluctuations, and the electricity pricing models are investigated in detail. Based on this investigation, the long-term suitability of MPC for inverter ACs is comprehensively evaluated. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the proposed model predictive controller, including the time-varying prediction model, cost function, constraints, and control signal converter. The details of the MPC process\u2014including discussions on the temperature set-point assignment in the optimization-based and hybrid conditions, disturbances, and evaluation index, are presented in Section 3. Section 4 compares the performance of inverter ACs with the proposed MPC. 2 Model predictive control of inverter ACs 2.1 Principle of model predictive control MPC is an optimal control method. A digital model is used to predict the future outputs of the system based on the proposed optimal future control actions called manipulated variables, past inputs, and past outputs. These optimal actions are calculated by the optimizer, considering the cost function and constraints. However, only the first optimal action is applied to the real system. The entire process is repeated during the next sampling time. Subsequently, the measured states are fed back to compensate for prediction errors, as shown in Fig. 1 . An MPC framework can be defined by the following finite-horizon optimization problem [21]: (1) J u k = min u 0 , . . . . u N ∑ k = 0 N l k x k , u k Cost function Subject to: (2) x k + 1 = f x k , u k , d k Prediction model (3) x k , u k ∈ X k × U k where N is the prediction horizon, Xk and Uk are the constraint sets for states xk and manipulated variables uk , respectively, at the time step k, and dk is the disturbance at time step k. The structure of the optimal control system for an MPC controller of an inverter AC is shown in Fig. 2 . There are two aspects that must be considered while designing the MPC controller: (1) a room model that can predict the indoor air temperature or load and an inverter AC model that can predict the required cooling capacity; and (2) an optimizer that considers the cost function and constraints to achieve energy saving, cost saving, and temperature control. Furthermore, before applying time-manipulated variables to the inverter AC, a signal converter is required to convert the manipulated variable signals to directly implementable signals. 2.2 Prediction models MPC requires appropriate models of the room and inverter AC. The mathematical models of the room and the AC must be able to accurately predict the room thermodynamics and provide computational efficiency for real-time control and optimization. 2.2.1 Room model Various building energy simulation tools such as EnergyPlus and TRNSYS can be used to construct an accurate physical model of a room, but these models are too complicated for real-time control and optimization [22]. Therefore, in this study, we construct a data-driven gray resistance-capacitance (RC) network model based on the state-space formulation given by Eqs. (4)\u2013(7) [13]. (4) C wall d T w . out d t = T o - T w . out R w . out + T w . i nt - T w . out R wall + f solar , wall A wall I solar (5) C wall d T w .int d t = T w .out - T w .int R wall + T in - T w .int R w .in (6) C in d T in d t = T m - T in R in .m + T w .in - T in R w .in + T o - T in R wind + f inter .in Q inter + Q HVAC (7) C m d T m d t = T in - T m R in .m + f solar .m A wind I solar + f inter .m Q inter where R and C are the heat resistance and capacitance of the room, respectively; T is the temperature; the subscripts wall, w.out, w.int, o, in, m, and wind denote the wall, external wall layer, internal wall layer, outdoor air, indoor air, internal mass, and window, respectively; Q inter and Q HVAC are the internal heat gain and heat removed by the inverter ACs, respectively; I solar is the solar radiation; A is the geometric area of the wall; and f is the conversion coefficient of the heat gain. 2.2.2 Inverter AC model There are two types of inverter AC models: the transient model and the steady-state model. As the thermal dynamic variation of the refrigerant is much faster than that of the room, the steady-state model is sufficient for the MPC designed herein [23]. The steady-state performances of the inverter AC (cooling capacity, energy efficiency ratio (EER), and power) are determined by the indoor air temperature (T in), outdoor air temperature (T o), and different compressor rotational speeds (N comp) (Eqs. (8)\u2013(10)). A 3-dimensional linear model that can predict performance under time-varying indoor air and outdoor air temperatures was developed herein. (8) EER = f ( T in , T o , N comp ) (9) Q = f ( T in , T o , N comp ) (10) Q = f ( T in , T o , P ) where T is the temperature, N comp is the compressor speed, and EER, Q, and P are the energy efficiency ratio, cooling capacity, and power, respectively; the subscripts in, o, and comp denote the indoor air, outdoor air, and compressor, respectively. 2.2.3 System model The combination of the room and the inverter AC is the target system. The system model is an extremely important part of the MPC controller that predicts the comfort of a room considering several future manipulated variables on the prediction horizon. A multiple-input single-output state\u2013space model (SSM) was constructed herein, with disturbance inputs of T o, I solar, and Q inter, electricity cost as the manipulated variable, an output of T in, and states of T w.out, T w.int, T in, and T m. The SSM is a first-order time-varying equation wherein matrix B varies with the price of electricity (Eqs. (11) and (12)). (11) T k + 1 = A T k + B u k + E d k (12) T k = C T k + D d k where the system states T = [T w.out T w.int T in T m]T, the disturbance inputs d = [T o I solar Q inter 1]T, and the manipulated variable u = Cost. The room considered herein is a single residential room in a hot climate, located in Guangzhou in China. The room (L = 4.8 m, W = 3.7 m, H = 3 m) has one east-facing exterior wall (4.8 m × 3 m) and one south-facing exterior wall (3.6 m × 3 m). The overall heat transfer coefficients of the single glazed window and the exterior wall are 5.69 and 2.57 W/(m2·K) and the window-wall-ratio of each wall is 0.2. The parameters in Eqs(4)-(7) can be identified based on actual test data or simulated building energy data. In this paper, the identification results from [19], which is gotten through a TRNSYS simulation, are used. The parameters are as follows: R wall = 0.006 K/W, R wind = 0.0051 K/W, R w . in = 0.0041 K/W, R in . m = 0.0023 K/W, R w . out = 0.001 K/W, f solar . m = 0.0012, f inter . in = 3.0367, f solar . w = 0.4834, f inter . m = 0.9976, C wall = 8381 kJ/K, C m = 13904 kJ/K, and C in = 871 kJ/K. A total of 80 sets of experimental data of a 2.5 kW inverter AC from Gayeski [24] were used to identify and validate the inverter AC model, of which 60% were used for identification and the rest were used for validation. The linear model is given by Eq. (13). Fig. 3 compares the identified and validated data. The deviations were primarily in the range of ± 15%. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) was 7.1%. (13) Q HVAC = 54.048 T in - 41.356 T o + 1.644 P + 117 0.28 The initial states are [28.09, 27.52, 26.48, 27.27], and the matrices A, B, E, C, and D in the discrete-time SSM, which are derived from Eqs. (4)\u2013(10), are as follows: A = 10 - 3 959.12 5.8003 0.0230 0.0012 5.8003 985.76 7.4167 0.5848 0.2214 71.298 727.03 127.77 0.0004 0.1763 4.0058 995.64 B = 10 - 3 [ - 0.0537 - 26.590 - 5813.8 / E P - 14.335 ] E = 10 - 4 350.56 3.4163 0.0001 - 0.0319 4.2467 0.0102 0.0409 - 15.767 699.48 0.0003 8.9530 - 3447.5 1.7246 0.0007 0.1294 - 8.5004 C = [ 0 0 1 0 ] D = [ 0 0 0 0 ] where EP denotes the electricity price. 2.3 Optimization The proposed MPC optimizes the cooling supply of inverter ACs to realize cost savings and reduce the deviation of the inside temperature from the desired value in accordance with the cost function (Eq. (14)) in the prediction horizon, N [25]. The constraint is given by Eq. (15). The cost function is a quadratic cost that is solved by quadratic programming. (14) J = min ∑ k = 0 N w C C ̂ o s t ( t + k | t ) + ∑ k = 0 N w T ( T ̂ ( t + k | t ) - T set ( t + k | t ) ) 2 + ∑ k = 0 N w ε ε 2 ( t + k | t ) (15) T low ⩽ T ⩽ T up where C ^ o s t , T ^ , w, and ε are the normalized electricity cost, normalized indoor air temperature, penalty weighting factor, and slack variable, respectively; N refers to the number of prediction horizons; the subscripts t and k denote the current time and time step, respectively; and the subscripts low and up denote the lower and upper indoor air temperature limits, respectively. On the right-hand side of Eq. (14), the first term is the electricity cost, the second term is the temperature deviation cost, and the last term is the constraint violation cost. Different weighting factors for each term yield different results. As the weighting factor ratio (wT : wC ) is high, the cost function is a thermal comfort-dominated setting. The normalized electricity cost and indoor air temperature are defined by Eqs. (16) and (17). (16) C ̂ o s t = C o s t / C o s t max (17) T ⌢ = T - T set / T up - T low where Cos t max is the maximum electricity cost, which is equal to the sum of the rated power of the inverter AC and the maximum electricity price and sampling time, and T set is the set-point of the indoor air temperature. The prediction horizon and sampling time have a significant influence on the controlled results. The prediction horizon is determined by thermal inertia of the room, the variation frequency of RTP, computation time cost and so on. For rooms with large thermal inertia, the prediction horizon should be long enough, approximately 5\u201348 h [26\u201328]. When MPC is applied to small thermal inertia rooms, the prediction horizon should be short, as 0.5\u20134 h [19,22,29]. The investigated room is built with light thermal mass and has small thermal inertia. Consequently, the prediction horizon herein is selected as 3 h. To respond to the dynamics of the room and reduce the mechanical wear of the compressor, the sampling time was set to 5 min (N = 36). 2.4 Control signal converter The cooling capacity of an inverter AC can be modulated by the compressor frequency, indoor fan speed, outdoor fan speed, and superheating degree. However, the compressor frequency is the primary impact factor and is always used for capacity control. In this study, the optimization result follows the trajectory of the electricity cost ( Cost ( t + 1| t ) C o s t ( t + 2| t ) . . . C o s t ( t + N | t ) ). Therefore, a control signal converter must be built to convert the cost into frequency. First, the power (P) of the inverter AC can be obtained by dividing the electricity cost by the real-time electricity price and sampling time Δt. Subsequently, a 3-dimensional nonlinear lumped parameter model is used to convert the power (P) to the compressor frequency (N comp). A model with 20 coefficients was used herein (Eq. (18)) and the resulting MAPE was 1.4%. (18) N comp = f T in , T out , P where the frequency range of the inverter AC is 20\u2013100 Hz. When N comp is less than 20 Hz, the inverter AC is switched off. 3 Implementation of MPC A simulation testbed was constructed to test the performance of the proposed MPC considering different operating conditions, weather conditions, and electricity prices, in comparison with PID and MhD. Computer-based dynamic simulation is effective and cost-efficient under various conditions. MATLAB/Simulink was used as the simulation environment herein owing to its visualization, flexibility, and calculation efficiency. The room energy system testbed, as illustrated in Fig. 4 , consisted of a controller, virtual testbed including the thermal room and inverter AC, and temperature setting module to assign the indoor air temperature at different times and electricity prices, in which the model of the thermal room is continuous state-space model that is different from that in prediction model of MPC controller and the model of inverter AC is a polynomial model that is more complex and accurate than that of MPC controller. 3.1 Preparation of input variables 3.1.1 Weather conditions During the simulation process, the weather data must be obtained in advance from a local observatory or a prediction model. In this study, the weather forecast was obtained from the website of the local observatory. The weather conditions during the cooling season in Guangzhou were chosen to study the MPC performance, assuming the weather data was accurately predicted. Fig. 5 shows the daily average weather between June 1 and September 1. To analyze the relationship between the weather and the performance of the controller, the solar\u2013air temperature was calculated to represent the combined influence of the weather on the thermal environment (Eq. (19)) [30] The average solar\u2013air temperatures in June, July, and August were 31.93 °C, 34.64 °C, and 33.80 °C, respectively. (19) T z = T in + a I solar α out where T z is the solar\u2013air temperature, a is the absorption factor of solar radiation and is equal to 0.65, and is the convective heat transfer coefficient of the exterior surface of the envelope and is equal to 18 W/(m2∙°C) [30] 3.1.2 Internal thermal load The internal thermal load in residential rooms is primarily generated by equipment such as televisions, computers, lighting, etc. and the occupants themselves, and is determined by occupant behavior. Occupant behavior has inherent uncertainty owing to its stochastic nature and modeling errors. This inherent uncertainty of the internal thermal load affects the performance of the MPC. To better exploit the strengths of MPC in practical applications, a further study of human behavior is required to build a more accurate model. For simplicity, the internal load when occupants are in the room was assumed to be 100 W herein. 3.1.3 Electricity price Compared to a TOU price, a high-resolution RTP is more beneficial to power systems in terms of flattening the load profile and reducing peak demand [31]. Therefore, RTP was selected as the main DR object herein [32]. However, currently, RTP is not employed in the power market in China, and a TOU price is used in most cities to shift the peak-hour energy, which only reflects the long-term or mid-term power demand\u2013supply balance. Therefore, a TOU price was also used herein to investigate the DR performance and evaluate the influence of different electricity pricing models on the performance of the proposed MPC. The RTP determines the matrix B in the SSM. The time-varying coefficient matrix is assigned a prediction horizon in advance. Consequently, the RTP must be predicted or obtained from an electricity retailer in advance. Although RTP has not yet been employed in China, it is an important trend to make the price reflect the real-time balance of supply and demand as much as possible [33]. In our simulation, typical RTP at 15-min intervals was obtained from a mature real-time electricity price market\u2014the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) for June, July, and August [34]. To increase the computation speed, the electricity price was converted from USD to RMB, thereby ensuring that a similar nominal value could be used for both RTP and TOU prices in China. Fig. 6 shows the typical daily RTP profiles during the cooling season. Two types of TOU prices that are used in China, the residential peak-valley electricity price (PVP) and the residential peak-valley-flat electricity price (PVFP), were employed herein (Fig. 7 ). 3.2 Set-point of indoor air temperature 3.2.1 MPC-optimization DR In optimization-based DR, MPC is directly applied to inverter ACs by optimizing the cost. The indoor temperature set-points are determined based on only the comfort preference of the occupants and the occupancy fluctuation pattern. When the occupants are active, i.e., between 8:00 and 24:00, the indoor air temperature set-point was 24 °C, and the fluctuation range was 22\u201326 °C. When the occupants are at rest, i.e., between 24:00 and 8:00, the indoor air temperature set-point was 26 °C, and the fluctuation range was 24\u201328 °C. 3.2.2 MPC-hybrid DR To further realize peak shifting and cost saving, the indoor air temperature set-points of the MPC were varied in accordance with the daily fluctuation of RTP in one day, which is hybrid DR method. Lower temperature set-points were assigned to lower prices, and higher temperature set-points were assigned to higher prices. The algorithm first determines the minimum and maximum electricity prices over the next 24-h period and divides the price range averagely (Eq. (20)). Simultaneously, the same number of temperature set points were assigned to the comfortable temperature range. Finally, each price range was coupled to a temperature set-point at an interval of 15 min. The assigned temperature set-points are listed in Table.1 . (20) RT P i = R T P min + i RT P max - R T P min 4 where RTP min and RTP max are the minimum and maximum electricity prices, respectively, and i is an integer between 0 and 5. 3.3 Evaluation index of different control methods The energy saving and electricity cost savings during the entire cooling season or an entire day were calculated to evaluate the integrated performance of the different control methods considering different disturbances (such as the weather and electricity price). The energy saving and electricity cost savings during peak hours are direct indices of the DR. The percentage of energy savings and cost savings were calculated using Eqs. (21) and (22). (21) Energy saving( Δ t) = ( E Basic - E Study ) E Basic × 100 % (22) Cost saving( Δ t) = ( C o s t Basic - C o s t Study ) Cos t Basic × 100 % where E and Cost are the total energy consumption and electricity cost for a given duration; △t represents the duration of energy consumption and electricity cost, such as the entire cooling season, an entire day, or the peak hours; and the subscripts Basic and Study denote the basic and study control cases, respectively. 4 Results and discussions 4.1 Performance differences between MPC and PID The system performances of the PID and MPC controllers with a weight factor ratio wT : wC = 1 : 1 were tested and compared. To analyze the different control methods in detail, three typical days between August 3 and August 5 were selected herein. Fig. 8 shows the weather conditions and RTP during the three days. The weather was hot on days two and three, with solar\u2013air temperatures of 36.1 °C and 34.9 °C, respectively. The electricity prices on day three fluctuated more than those on the previous two days. Fig. 9 shows the system time-series control results of the two control systems. Fig. 9(a) demonstrates that both control methods could satisfactorily maintain the indoor air temperature within the temperature limits. Compared to the PID control method, MPC makes indoor air temperature cooler than the temperature set-points at 8:00, when the weather was cool and RTP was low, to realize cooling storage through thermal inertia; during the peak hours between 15:00 and 17:00, when the RTP was high and the cooling load was large, the indoor air temperature with MPC was higher than the temperature set-points to save costs. This overcooling strategy increases energy consumption during off-peak periods and overheating strategy results in less electricity cost energy consumption and electricity cost during peak hours, as shown in Fig. 9(b) and 9(c). Especially on days two and three, this resulted in an obvious peak shift. As shown in Fig. 10 , compared to the PID control method, the reduction in the all-day energy consumption of the inverter AC with MPC was − 3.58% on day one, 19.37% on day two, and 12.78% on day three, whereas the reduction in the peak-hour energy consumption was − 1.77% on day one, 41.45% on day two, and 19.11% on day three. The energy saving and peak shifting were influenced by the RTP profiles and the weather conditions. As the MPC method can shift energy consumption from peak hours to off-peak hours, it provided better electricity cost savings over an entire day and during peak hours even though on day one, the all-day electricity cost saving was 16.36% and the peak-hour electricity cost saving was 30.29%. The cost savings are also influenced by the weather and fluctuation of RTP. Over the entire cooling season, although more energy was consumed on some days, the MPC method realized an energy saving of 13.64%, a peak-hour energy saving of 21.60%, an electricity cost saving of 27.43%, and a peak-hour cost saving of 43.11%. The statistical distributions of the measured indoor air temperature between 8:00 and 24:00 over different periods are shown in Fig. 11 . It can be found that both PID and MPC control methods have good control performances and the temperature fluctuation ranges are mostly within 1℃, which is a proven thermal comfort range for human beings. As shown in Fig. 11(a), the mean value and fluctuation range of the indoor air temperature were a little large on days two and three. And on day three, the fluctuation range of the indoor air temperature was larger as the RTP was very high during the peak hours. As shown in Fig. 11(b), the mean indoor temperature with the MPC and PID control systems was 24.2 °C and 24.0 °C, respectively, during the entire cooling season. The Temperature control performances of PID and MPC are quite close. To conclude, the reasons of MPC to realize energy shifting, cost-saving, and thermal comfort keeping are mainly to utilize room thermal inertia and the high performance of inverter air conditioner under different outdoor to respond to RTP. Firstly, by utilizing room thermal inertia to realize cold storage ahead when RTP and outdoor air temperature are low. when RTP and outdoor air temperature are high, the room thermal mass could release cold to keep thermal comfort and reduce energy consumption. Meanwhile, an increase in the indoor temperature may decrease the cooling load and enhance the energy efficiency of the AC to affect the energy-saving rate and cost-saving rate. 4.2 Performance differences between MPC-optimization DR and MPC-hybrid DR In this section, the indoor air temperature set-points are fixed in the MoD and varied in the MhD. Three consecutive typical days with different weather patterns and RTP curves were used to study the performances of the MoD and MhD, as shown in Fig. 12 . Fig. 13 shows the temporal system control results of the MoD and MhD. As shown in Fig. 13(a), the indoor air temperature set-points of the MhD were higher than those of the MoD during peak hours. Owing to the good temperature control capability of the MPC method, the indoor air temperature was maintained within the temperature limits even when the temperature set-points were high. The higher set-points reduced the peak-hour cooling load, resulting in an obvious reduction in the energy consumption and electricity cost during peak hours, as shown in Fig. 13(b) and 13(c). Fig. 14 compares the system performance of the MoD and MhD. Compared to the MoD, the reduction in peak-hour energy with MhD was 3.92% on day one, 72.15% on day two, and 40.83% on day three. As the MhD shifts energy consumption from the high-RTP period to the low-RTP period, the all-day cost reduction was 46.62% on day two and 28.37% on day three. On day one, as the weather was cooler, the fluctuation in RTP was significant, making indoor air temperature set-points of the MoD and MhD were similar for most of the day, except during the peak hours. However, owing to the sharp dynamic set-points, the inverter AC was less stable, negatively impacting its performance, and increasing its all-day energy consumption and electricity cost. During the entire cooling season, although the energy costs and consumption were high on some days, the MhD realized an energy saving of 14.18%, a peak-hour energy saving of 33.83%, an electricity cost saving of 17.48%, and a peak-hour cost saving of 33.62%. Therefore, higher energy and electricity cost savings and more effective peak shifting were achieved by assigning temperature set-points. 4.3 Effects of electricity pricing model on MPC performance The performance of the proposed MPC was compared with that of the PID control method under different pricing models\u2014RTP and TOU price including PVFP and PVP\u2014as shown in Fig. 15(a). Compared to the PID, the total energy saving was − 2.65%, the cost saving was 0.25%, the peak-hour energy saving was 3.93%, and the peak-hour cost saving was 4.63% over the entire cooling season with MPCPVFP. With MPCPVP, the total energy saving was − 4.78%, the cost saving was − 4.86%, the peak-hour energy saving was 0.83%, and the peak-hour cost saving was 0.83% over the entire cooling season. Under the TOU pricing model, the proposed MPC could realize peak shifting, but its ability to shift the peak was weaker than that of the MPC under the RTP model. Furthermore, under the TOU pricing model, the MPC saved lesser energy and costs compared to the PID. Compared to MPCPVP, MPCPVFP has better performance, as PVFP can better reflect the power response and demand. For example, the highest price of electricity between 14:00 and 17:00 was almost the same as the duration of the peak load of the room during the day. Figure 15(b) illustrates the statistical distributions of the indoor air temperature between 8:00 and 24:00 over the entire cooling season. Compared to MPCRTP, the indoor air temperature control deviation was lesser under the TOU pricing model with MPC. As the curve of the electricity price is flat and the difference between the peak-hour cost and valley-hour cost is small, the optimal control sequences of the calculated frequency have a negligible effect on the energy and cost savings and peak shifting, and a strong effect on temperature control. 4.4 Effects of weather and RTP on MPC performance Previous studies have shown that weather conditions and RTP fluctuations affect the performance of an MPC. In this section, the relationship between the MPC performance and weather conditions and fluctuation of RTP are analyzed by comparing the daily average solar\u2013air temperature, the standard deviation (STD) of RTP, and the daily total performance. Figure 16 shows the weather conditions and RTP between June 1 and September 1. The daily average solar\u2013air temperature was 24.8\u201341.7 °C, and the STD of RTP was 0.1\u20138.1. As shown in Figure 17 (a) and 17(b), compared to the PID control method, the daily total energy saving with the MPC was − 34.51%\u201334.17%, the daily peak-hour total energy saving was − 22.25%\u201398.82%, the daily total cost saving was − 27.03%\u201380.79%, and the daily peak-hour total cost saving was − 22.46%\u201399.36%. Owing to the fluctuations in the weather conditions and RTP, the performance of the MPC varied significantly during the cooling season in Guangzhou. The energy and electricity consumptions with the MPC were the highest on June 11, and were 34.51% and 27.03% higher, respectively, than those with the PID control method. The daily average solar\u2013air temperature on June 11 was 27.9 °C, resulting in a small cooling load that caused the inverter AC to start and stop frequently, which led to large temperature fluctuations. As the control objective of the MPC is to maintain a balance between cost savings and temperature control, more electricity is consumed to maintain the temperature. In addition, owing to the flat electricity-price fluctuation, the shifting peak capability of the MPC decreases. The best MPC performance, including energy saving, cost saving, peak-hour energy, and peak-hour cost saving, during the entire cooling season, was achieved on June 19. The daily average solar\u2013air temperature was 36.4 °C, whereas the daily STD of RTP was 7.28, which was the highest during the entire cooling season. The peak shifting performance of the MPC was the worst on August 2, when the daily average solar\u2013air temperature was 28.4 °C, and the daily STD of RTP was only 0.31. Therefore, based on this analysis, as the weather becomes hotter and the RTP fluctuation increases, the performance of the MPC becomes better than that of the PID control method. Figure 18 shows the values of the correlation coefficient (r) between the four coefficients of performance and the daily average solar\u2013air temperature and STD of RTP. As the p-values were less than 0.05, the correlation coefficients can be used for analysis. Figure 18(a) shows that the r of the energy saving and the daily average solar\u2013air temperature is 0.84, which is larger than the r of the energy saving and the daily STD of RTP. This implies that the energy saving has a stronger correlation with the daily average solar-air temperature than the daily STD of RTP. Cost saving, which is important to residents, has a stronger correlation with the daily STD of RTP than the daily average solar\u2013air temperature, as shown in Figure 18(b). The shifting peak performance has a strong correlation with the daily STD of RTP, as shown in Figure 18(c) and 18(d). In summary, the proposed MPC offers good performance even in terrible weather conditions and power imbalances. 4.5 Effects of weighting factor ratio on MPC performance The weight factor ratio wT : wC in the cost function has a significant influence on performance. The performance of the MPC (1:1) is much better than that of the PID, especially in terms of the peak-hour cost and energy shifting. A higher weighting factor ratio of 2:1 (MPC (2:1)) was used to analyze the effect of the weighting factor ratio on MPC performance. Figure 19 depicts the cooling-season performance of the MPC under different weighting factor ratios. Compared to the PID control method, the total energy saving with MPC (2:1) over the entire cooling season was 1.06%, the cost saving was 13.44%, the peak-hour energy saving was 6.34%, and the peak-hour cost saving was 26.63%. Therefore, the energy and cost saving and peak shifting ability of MPC (2:1) was weaker than that of MPC (1:1). However, as shown in Figure 20 , MPC (2:1) provided the least fluctuation in the indoor air temperature, which explains why MPC (1:1) had a higher energy consumption. 5 Conclusion In this study, a time-varying MPC was designed to control an inverter AC in a residential room to realize DR. A simulation testbed for a room energy system was built using MATLAB to analyze the performance of the proposed MPC. This research bridges the knowledge gaps in two points: to evaluate seasonal demand response performances of MPC on the inverter air conditioner; to classify and evaluate the performance of different demand response MPC methods. This may help many utilities know the operating characteristic of MPC and adopt MPC in real projects with better economic benefit. The main conclusions are as follows: 1) DR using MPC can reduce the peak-hour energy consumption by 21.60% and the total energy cost by 27.43% over the entire cooling season, while maintaining indoor comfort; 2) Compared to Mo-DR, Mh-DR reduces peak energy use by 33.83% and the cost by 33.62% by adjusting the indoor air temperature according to the dynamic tariff; 3) Compared to MPC under a TOU price, MPC under an RTP offers better performance as it can reflect power supply and demand in a timely and effective manner. Therefore, to improve the performance of MPC, a reasonable electricity pricing model such as RTP should be employed in power distribution grids; 4) DR with MPC control is suitable for hot weather with widely-fluctuated RTP.

        "dc:description": "The supply-demand imbalance of electricity increases the operating burden on smart grids, decreases the average efficiency of power generation equipment, and threatens the safe operation of power grids. Residential air conditioning is a flexible load and a major consumer of electricity. Therefore, demand response control can be applied to air conditioners (ACs) to shift their peak energy consumption and save energy. Model predictive control (MPC) is an effective demand response control method. In this study, we analyze the cooling seasonal performance of an inverter AC with MPC. A time-varying MPC was designed and evaluated using a simulation testbed that was constructed using MATLAB. Subsequently, the energy, cost, and temperature control performances of the MPC were analyzed in detail from electricity pricing model, weather conditions and fluctuation of real-time price. The results show that compared to the proportional\u2013integral\u2013derivative (PID) control method, MPC can shift the peak-hour energy consumption by 6.34%\u201321.60% and reduce the total electricity costs by 13.44%\u201327.43%, while maintaining indoor thermal comfort during the whole cooling season, and Demand response with MPC control is very suited to hot weather conditions with highly fluctuating RTP. By applying MPC hybrid demand response under real-time price, there are better performances on peak shifting and cost saving.",
