Space heating accounts for a significant share of a building's energy use; moreover, occupants' desires for better thermal comfort may further increase the energy use and peak load of the space heating system, as well as its total energy cost. The goal of this study was to use an optimal control technique: model-based predictive controller, to improve the energy and economic performance of space heating systems with satisfying indoor temperature. The proposed optimal controller incorporated the dynamic energy prices, the disturbances from weather and occupancy, as well as a nonlinear system dynamic model that considered the building thermal mass as thermal energy storage. The model-based predictive controller was tested by simulation on a university building in central Norway, and its control performance was compared to a conventional rule-based control approach, which is currently employed by the case system. The model-based predictive controller's effectiveness was demonstrated by a 2.8% reduction in heat use, 8.8% shaving in peak load, 3.8% saving in heating cost, and a 59% drop in indoor temperature violation. Furthermore, a sensitivity study revealed that the model-based predictive controller still maintained high energy and economic performance even under lightweight building constructions with decreased building thermal mass.

In the European Union (EU) countries, buildings are responsible for nearly 40% of the total energy use and about 36% of the total greenhouse gas emissions [1]. Among buildings' energy use, heating and cooling accounts for a significant portion and plays a crucial role in the EU's ambition to transition into a clean and carbon-neutral economy by 2050. According to 2019 figures from Eurostat, approximately 75% of heating and cooling is still generated from fossil fuels while only 22% is generated from renewable energy [2]. As a result, reducing the energy use of the heating and cooling sector is imperative, and many researchers contribute to it by exploring different techniques. Regarding the cooling system, some researchers focus on the techniques of energy monitoring and diagnosis to facilitate energy use saving. Sorrentino et al. proposed a method, which joints deployment of two estimators, for online monitoring of cooling load supplied by Telecommunication (TLC) cooling systems. The results confirmed the suitability of the proposed procedure as a reliable and effective energy monitoring and diagnostic tool for TLC applications [3]. Afterwards, D'Aniello et al. deepened the theme of monitoring and energetic diagnosis of TLC central offices, via the development and application of innovative performance parameters [4]. Meanwhile, Sorrentino et al. developed a model-based tool for advanced monitoring and diagnosis of TLC sites, and pointed out that the proposed diagnostic tools could be embedded in advanced energy intelligence platforms [5]. Despite building cooling being an important element of the decarbonisation policy, the building heating system plays an even more important role in the EU's residential sector. In the EU residential sector, around 80% of the buildings' energy use is for heating purposes including space heating (SH) and domestic hot water, especially during the winter season [6]. This figure indicates that minor energy savings in building heating systems might have a significant impact on the energy use of the building sector, and hence on the energy use of the entire energy system. Therefore, this study focus on exploring techniques for reducing the energy use of building heating systems. Nevertheless, there is a growing trend for building occupants to demand higher thermal comfort, which may result in increased building energy use. As a result, building heating system control must make a trade-off between the two conflicting goals: 1) improve thermal comfort, and 2) reduce energy use as well as energy costs. The application of intelligent control techniques for the SH system may be one way to achieve the above conflicting goals simultaneously [7]. Model predictive control (MPC), originated in the process industries (oil refineries, chemical plants, etc.), is an ideal intelligent control strategy to deal with an optimal control problem of buildings [8]. In the presence of disturbances and constraints, an MPC controller in a building employs a dynamic building model to predict the building's thermal behaviour and outputs a control vector minimizing an objective function over the prediction horizon. MPC is a potential control solution that may be focused on the reduction of energy use, energy cost, and associated greenhouse gas emissions while maintaining and potentially improving occupant comfort [9]. The suitability of MPC to tackle the optimal control of the SH system has been proven both by theory and real-life experiments. Aoun et al. proposed a mixed-integer linear programming-based MPC strategy to improve the operation of the SH systems in buildings. The proposed methods were tested by numerical simulation method, and the simulation results showed that the adopted MPC proved to be more cost-effective than the conventional weather compensation controller (WCC), while maintaining satisfied indoor temperature [10]. Seal et al. implemented a centralized MPC for a zone with a hybrid electric heating system, considering indoor temperature and energy management. Results showed that a 13.5% reduction of the energy cost was achieved by the proposed MPC during a 7-day simulation period [11]. Ławryńczuk et al. investigated the optimization of an underfloor electric heating system in a residential building by using an MPC controller. Simulation results demonstrated the effectiveness of the MPC regarding energy use saving, and around 1430 kWh electricity was reduced during the investigated heating season [12]. Privara et al. explored applying an MPC controller for the building heating system. The MPC controller was tested on a real university building. During the studied heating season, the achieved energy savings by the MPC controller were 17\u201324% compared to the conventional controller [13]. Similarly, Široký et al. analysed the implementation of MPC for the SH system in buildings and tested the proposed methods on a real building. Two months\u2019 experiments showed that the energy savings potential of the investigated building were 15%\u201328% by using an MPC controller [14]. Another benefit from the implementation of MPC in building energy systems is that thermal energy storage (TES) can be easily incorporated into the MPC design. TESs together with control techniques are becoming increasingly significant in shifting the peak energy demand and consequently reducing the system energy cost. For example, the peak energy demand contributes significantly to the energy cost for both heat suppliers and heat users in a district heating (DH) system. Regarding the heat supplier side, the peak loads decide the installed capacity of the heat production plants, which directly affects the investment and operation costs of the plants [15]. In some cases, peaks loads are provided by fossil-based boilers, which makes peak load shaving even more imperative [16]. This is why many heating suppliers include the peak loads of heat users as an important component in their heating price models. For instance, a survey on Swedish heating price models finds that around 87% of the investigated heating price models take heat users' peak load into account, with the peak load charging fee accounting for 10\u201350% of the total heating cost for the heat users [17]. Therefore, the investigation of control techniques integrated with TESs has attracted lots of attention in recent years. Some researchers have investigated the possibility of reducing energy costs by introducing a borehole TES or a water tank as TESs into building heating systems and incorporating these TESs with control techniques. Rohde et al. introduced an ice TES and a borehole TES into an integrated heating and cooling system for a building complex. Afterwards, a dynamic optimization control technique was applied to optimize the system operation. The simulation results showed that the electricity use of the system was reduced by about 5% for the analysed year [18]. Similarly, Li et al. introduced a water tank and a borehole TES to a campus DH system, and incorporated these TESs with control techniques to improve system performance in terms of energy, economy and environment. The simulation results showed the effectiveness of the proposed method with an annual energy cost saving of 5\u20136% and CO2 emission reduction of up to 8% [19]. However, integrating these TESs into buildings necessitates additional initial investment as well as maintenance costs. Buildings with large thermal mass, in fact, can be used as short-term TESs and have been proven to have large energy flexibility potential that allows peak load shaving and energy cost-saving [20]. Therefore, many researchers have started to explore the potential of integrating building thermal mass with control techniques, especially with MPC control strategy, to reduce the energy cost of the building heating system. Dominković et al. investigated the potential of using building thermal mass as TESs for DH systems to optimize the energy systems' operation from the energy supply side, whose cost function was set to minimize the energy plants\u2019 investment, operating and maintenance costs, as well as their fuel costs and CO2 emission costs. Simulation results showed that the building thermal mass could be used as intra-day storage to perform peak load shaving, and the operational cost saving of the investigated DH system was up to 4.6%, which was originated from the less utilized peak boilers and more effectively utilized solar thermal sources [21]. Pedersen et al. studied incorporating the building thermal mass as TES into an MPC scheme to perform peak load shaving and reduce heating costs for an individual electrical heating system. The cost function was set to minimize the electricity cost used by the SH system. Simulation results showed that around 6% of the electricity cost can be saved for the heat user [22]. Hu et al. designed an economic MPC controller for floor heating systems considering building thermal mass as TES. Simulation results showed that the designed MPC controller was able to utilize the thermal mass of the building to optimally shift energy use to low-price periods [23]. In summary, MPC assists in realizing the energy-efficient operation of the building heating system and ensuring satisfying indoor temperature. Moreover, the incorporation of the building thermal mass into an MPC controller as TES can lead to further improvements. However, as pointed in Ref. [24], the MPC's performance may vary depending on the building type and climate conditions. Therefore, further research on the application of MPC in various types of buildings under various climate conditions is required. Additionally, most previous research focused on the implementation of linear MPC in building heating systems. The dynamics of a building heating system, however, are usually nonlinear, especially in the case of a hydronic heating system connected to a DH system. Typical building heating systems connected to DH networks are comprised of hydronic heat emitters, such as radiators, that are characterized by nonlinearities in their heat rate output driven by the temperature difference between the radiator and room [25]. In a real DH system, the supply water temperature and the water flow rate for a radiator system are often used as the manipulated variables to achieve the desired heating rate. As a result, a nonlinear radiator model involving the supply water temperature and the water flow rate as the manipulated variables may support the simulation of the real control strategy. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore the utilization of nonlinear MPC (NMPC) for SH systems of university buildings in Nordic climates. A university building located in Trondheim, Norway, was selected as the case study, which has detailed measurements from the building energy management system to support the research. The proposed NMPC controller optimized the operation of the building SH system, making a trade-off between the heating costs and the indoor temperature, while taking into account future disturbances (weather and occupancy), energy price, and energy demand. The main contributions of this study are summarized as the following. Firstly, this study investigated a university building located in central Norway, whose building type and climate zone are rarely addressed by previous studies. Secondly, this research proposed and validated a nonlinear dynamic model that can be used in NMPC controllers, enabling a reasonable compromise between the model accuracy and computational tractability. Finally, a sensitivity study was carried out to assess the impact of building thermal mass on MPC performance, providing a full picture of MPC's effectiveness over a wide variety of building constructions, from lightweight to heavyweight. The remainder of this article is organised as follows. Section 2 presents the modelling approach for the nonlinear system model, the formulation method of the objective function and constraints for the MPC, and the optimization framework to solve the MPC. Section 3 introduces the case study and research scenarios. Section 4 shows the model validation and the simulation results. Section 5 conducts a sensitivity analysis to investigate the impacts of building thermal mass on the MPC performance, and discusses the limitation of this study. Finally, in Section 6, conclusions are summarized. 2 Method This section firstly presents the modelling methods for the building and SH system, and then detailed information on the formulation of MPC and the optimization framework is introduced. 2.1 System model As highlighted in Ref. [8], the performance of MPC strongly depends on its embedded model, and developing an appropriate model is typically the most challenging part when designing an MPC controller. The main factor driving how to develop an appropriate model is the compromise between the model accuracy and computational tractability. The model must be accurate enough to predict the thermal behaviour of buildings, meanwhile, it should be as simple as possible to be computationally tractable and numerical stable [26]. Among commonly used models, the resistance-capacitance (RC) model has been demonstrated to be reliable and precise in predicting the thermal behaviour of buildings [27]. Therefore, an RC model was developed to capture the key characteristics of the building. The model was built by using the Modelica language, which is an object-oriented language to conveniently model physical systems [28]. Fig. 1 illustrates the components of the developed RC model and the heat fluxes exchanging among them. The model mainly consists of four components including the internal thermal mass, indoor air, building envelopes, and outdoor environment. Due to the low solar radiation in the analysed location during the study period, solar radiation was not taken into account in this study [29]. In addition, this study aimed to incorporate the building thermal mass as TES into the MPC controller to further improve the energy and economic performance of the system. Therefore, as presented in Fig. 1, a third-order RC model was developed with special attention to the thermal mass of building envelopes and the interior thermal mass, besides considering the thermal mass of indoor air, because their corresponding thermal inertia is necessary for the short-term TES in the intended MPC [10]. As for parameters\u2019 setting, it is commonly conducted either by estimation methods if the detailed information of the building geometry and thermal properties is well-known, or by system identification methods that use historical measured data to tune the values of the parameters, or a mix of both [30]. In this study, the parameters, including heat resistance and heat capacitance, were determined by an estimation method according to the available information of the investigated building and the recommended values in the European standard ISO 52016\u20131 [31]. Detailed calculations for the energy balances among each component given in Fig. 1 are shown in Equations (1)\u2013(3) as the following: (1) C e n v × d T e n v d t = T i a − T e n v R i , e + T o a − T e n v R o , e (2) C i a × d T i a d t = T m a − T i a R i , m + T e n v − T i a R i , e + T o a − T i a R w i n + T o a − T i a R v e n + Q ˙ r a + Q ˙ v e n + Q ˙ i n (3) C m a × d T m a d t = T i a − T m a R i , m where R and C represent the heat resistance and capacitance, respectively, whose values were obtained by the estimation method. T denotes the temperature. Subscripts i a , o a , e n v , m a , w i n , and v e n represent indoor air, outdoor air, building envelopes, internal thermal mass, windows, and ventilation, respectively. In addition, R i , e represents the heat resistance between the indoor air and the building envelopes. R o , e represents the heat resistance between the outdoor air and the building envelopes. R i , m represents the heat resistance between the indoor air and the interior thermal mass. Q ˙ i n is the internal heat gains, Q ˙ v e n is the heat flow rate from the mechanical ventilation system, and Q ˙ r a is the heat flow rate from the radiator system. All the above heat capacitances, heat resistances, temperatures, and heat flow rates in Equations (1)\u2013(3) are depicted in Fig. 1. Specifically, Q ˙ i n was obtained by historical measurement data and the Norwegian standard SN-NSPEK 3031 [32]. Q ˙ v e n is described as Equation (4) according to Norwegian standard SN-NSPEK 3031 [32]. Q ˙ r a is determined by Equations (5)\u2013(8). In this study, to get a more accurate dynamical description of the radiator, a discrete-element radiator model with N lumps was utilized and coupled to the RC model. This discrete-element radiator model was based on the European Standard EN 442\u20132 [33], which refers to it as the characteristic equation of the radiator. Meanwhile, previous studies have confirmed this model. In research [34], this discrete-element radiator model was developed and validated. Comparisons between simulation and experimental data indicated the effectiveness of the model. Similarly, in research [35], this discrete radiator model was validated using measured data, and the results suggested that the model is capable of accurately describing the dynamics of radiators. Furthermore, the Modelica IBPSA library, which was co-developed by research teams from RWTH Aachen University and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, etc., uses this discrete radiator model as well [36]. Finally, Q ˙ s h is the total heat flow rate of the SH system as shown in Equation (9). (4) Q ˙ v e n = 0.33 × V ˙ a i r × 1 − η T × T i a r e f − T o a (5) Q ˙ r a = ∑ n = 1 N Q ˙ n (6) Q ˙ n = K n × F n × T n − T i a (7) K n = ( T n − T i a ) a (8) c p _ r a × d T n d t = c p _ w × m ˙ r a × T n − 1 − T n − Q ˙ n (9) Q ˙ s h = Q ˙ v e n + Q ˙ r a where V ˙ a i r describes the mechanical ventilation volume flow rate, which was determined by the measured data and the Norwegian standard SN-NSPEK 3031 [32]. T i a r e f is the indoor temperature's reference value. η T denotes the temperature efficiency of heat recovery in the mechanical ventilation system. For each radiator section n , Q ˙ n represents the heat flow rate, T n describes the average water temperature, F n is the surface area and K n is the equivalent heat transfer coefficient. a is a characteristic coefficient of the radiator, which can be obtained from the radiator manufacturer and was 0.28 in this study [37]. In addition, c p _ r a is the radiator material's heat capacity for each section n . c p _ w and m ˙ r a are the specific water heat capacity and the water mass flow rate, respectively. The radiator model was nonlinear in this study due to the definition of K n , and hence made the dynamic system model in this study nonlinear. 2.2 Formulation of model predictive control In this study, the proposed MPC control strategy was used to improve the energy and economic performance of the SH system with satisfying indoor temperature. According to the research [17], heating price models generally include four components, fixed component (FXC), volume flow rate component (VFC), heat demand component (HDC), and load demand component (LDC). The FXC is the fee that a user must pay to stay connected to the DH network. The VFC is a fee based on the volume of hot water required to provide heat to users and is intended to encourage a low return temperature. The HDC covers the cost of fuel and is charged based on the users' heat use. The LDC covers the costs of DH companies maintaining a certain level of capacity for peak loads, as well as the initial investment in new facilities, depreciation, and other expenses. It is charged based on the users\u2019 peak loads. However, the FXC and the VFC usually only account for around 1\u20132% of the total heating cost. The HDC and the LDC contribute to about 96% of the total heating cost. Therefore, the generalized heating price model in Ref. [38], which only considered the HDC and LDC, was utilized as well in this study. In addition, the achieved indoor temperature was used as an indicator to estimate the thermal environment. Finally, a multi-objective optimization problem was formulated with two conflicting optimization goals as presented in Equations (10)\u2013(14). Minimize: (10) ∫ 0 H E P t × Q ˙ s h t × d t + L P × Q ˙ p + W × ∫ 0 H T i a t − T i a r e f t 2 × d t subject to: (11) x ( 0 ) = A (12) x ˙ ( t ) − F ( x ( t ) , u ( t ) ) = 0 (13) Q ˙ ( t ) ≤ Q ˙ p (14) u m i n ≤ u ( t ) ≤ u m a x where H denotes the prediction horizon and was 12 h in this study. E P ( t ) and L P are the dynamic HDC price at time t , and the LDC price, respectively. These energy prices were gained from the website of the local DH company [39]. The HDC price varied between 0.5 and 0.8 NOK/kWh, and the LDC price was 47 NOK/kW/month in this study. Q ˙ s h ( t ) is the heat rate at time t and Q ˙ p denotes the peak heat rate which is a free parameter that needed to be optimized. The peak heat rate was defined as the maximum hourly heat use in the simulation period in this study according to the research [40]. The first two terms in Equation (10) are the heating cost, including the HDC and the LDC. In addition, the third term in Equation (10) is the achieved indoor temperature target, which is expressed as a quadratic form to avoid high violations of the desired indoor temperature. In MPC, the sum of squared errors (SSE) is usually used in the trajectory-tracking target of an objective function [41]. Meanwhile, previous research has shown that minimizing SSE in the reference signal tracking problem is effective regarding the control of building energy systems [42]. Afterwards, a weighting factor W was used in the achieved indoor temperature term to represent the \u201cprice\u201d that the occupants are willing to pay for certain indoor temperatures, just like the energy prices in the heating cost term of the objective function [42]. In this study, the value of W was decided by the following criterion: when the deviation between the indoor temperature and the reference value was 0.5 K, the heating cost term and the achieved indoor temperature term contributed equally to the objective function. However, the value of W can be modified to other values based on the preferences of the system operators. T i a ( t ) and T i a r e f ( t ) are the achieved indoor temperature and the reference value at time t . The initial states of the dynamic system are described as Equation (11), and the values of these initial states are represented by the vector A . Equation (12) is the equality constraint of the formulated optimization problem, which is the dynamic system model developed in Section 2.1. Equation (13) and (14) are the inequality constraints of the formulated optimization problem, of which Equation (14) describes the bounds of manipulated variables. u m i n and u m a x are the lower and upper bounds of manipulated variables. In this study, the manipulated variables u ( t ) was defined as u ( t ) = [ T s h ( t ) m ˙ s h ( t ) ] T , of which T s h ( t ) and m ˙ s h ( t ) are the supply water temperature and the water flow rate of SH system. 2.3 Optimization framework In this study, the optimization problem formulated in Section 2.2 was solved on the optimization platform JModelica. JModelica is a software platform for modelling, simulation, and optimization of complex dynamic systems that are based on the Modelica modelling language [43]. This section describes the main steps of the optimization framework, as shown in Fig. 2 , which includes two main processes, the optimization process and the simulation process. At each time step, the future disturbances (weather and occupancy) and energy price, the objective function, and the equality and inequality constraints were incorporated into an optimization problem. This optimization problem was solved over the prediction horizon, and an optimized manipulated variable trajectory was generated for the next several hours to several days. However, only the optimized manipulated variables at the first time step were sent to the system dynamic model for the simulation process. In the simulation process, the system dynamic model was simulated under the first time step's disturbances by using the received optimized manipulated variables from the optimization process, and then yielded the state variables. These state variables were sent back to the system dynamic model used in the optimization process. The initial conditions of the system dynamic model were updated based on the feedback, and a new optimization problem was formulated and solved over the next prediction horizon. The optimization algorithm applied in the optimization process is illustrated in the upper part of Fig. 2. The optimization problem in the optimization process was an infinite-dimensional problem, which is challenging for computers to handle. One common method to solve the infinite-dimensional problem is to discretize it firstly and optimize it afterwards by direct approaches [44]. The main idea of the direct approach is to discretize the original infinite-dimensional problem into a finite-dimensional nonlinear programming (NLP) problem, which can be solved using NLP solvers. The direct approaches can be classified into two categories: simultaneous and sequential methods. The simultaneous method discretizes the state and manipulated variables simultaneously, while the sequential method only discretizes the manipulated variables [44]. In this study, a direct collocation method belonging to the simultaneous category was used to transcribe the original infinite-dimensional problem into a finite-dimensional NLP problem, as shown in Fig. 2. The more detailed information about the direct collocation method was presented in previous research [45]. However, the discretised finite-dimensional NLP problem had the inequality constraints defined by the constraints of manipulated variables as described in Section 2.2, which led the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of the NLP cannot be solved using the Newton's iteration method. To tackle this problem, an interior-point method was used to approximate the discretised NLP problem by an equality-constrained NLP problem. Finally, a local optimized manipulated variable trajectory was found by solving the KKT conditions of the equality-constrained NLP based on Newton's iteration method. 3 Case study and research scenarios The method introduced in Section 2 was tested on a university building by simulation. The background of the case building and the research scenarios are illustrated in this section. 3.1 Background of the case building A university building that is located in Trondheim, Norway was used to test the method proposed in Section 2, as shown in Fig. 3 a). The building was built in 1962, and it has six floors with a total floor area of 15 000 m2. This building is mainly used for education, offices, and laboratory [46]. The SH system in this building is presented in Fig. 3 b). A heat exchanger in the building heat substation is used to connect the SH system and the DH system of the campus. The SH system includes a radiator system and a mechanical ventilation system. The radiator system is used to compensate for the heat loss to the environment through building envelopes, as well as heat the entering cold air due to air infiltration. The mechanical ventilation system consists of several air-handling units (AHUs) and is used to heat the entering cold air due to mechanical ventilation and provide the occupants with heated fresh air. Table 1 summarizes the key information of the case building. The estimation method was used to acquire the heat resistance and heat capacitance values for the RC model proposed in Section 2.1. Firstly, the heat resistance and heat capacitance of each exterior thermal mass component exposed to the outdoor environment, such as the exterior walls or roof et al., were estimated by using the calculation method described in the European standard ISO 6946 [47]. Secondly, all of the building's exterior thermal mass components' heat resistances and capacitances were lumped into a single equivalent heat resistance and capacitance according to the suggested method in Ref. [48]. The equivalent heat resistance and capacitance reflected the overall thermal characteristics of all the exterior thermal mass components. When calculating the window's heat capacitance, one specific assumption was made: the window's thermal mass was assumed as zero because it could be neglected in comparison to the other exterior thermal mass components. The heat resistance and capacitance of interior thermal mass were estimated by using the same method described above. Finally, the estimated values for the heat resistance and capacitance marked in Fig. 1 are listed in Table 2 . 3.2 Research scenarios In this study, the occupancy schedule was based on historical measurement data and the Norwegian standard SN-NSPEK 3031 [32], and it was assumed to be perfectly predicted. In addition, the measured outdoor temperature from the campus energy management platform was used instead of the weather forecast information to explore the theoretical potential of the MPC. Two research scenarios were proposed in this study to evaluate the proposed MPC method, as shown in Fig. 4 . The reference scenario was based on a rule-based control (RBC) strategy, which was the control strategy of the current SH system in the case study building. As presented in Fig. 4 a), the supply water temperature was controlled by a WCC according to the current outdoor temperature. In addition, to achieve better control performance than a simple on-off controller, a proportional (P) controller was used to adjust the SH system's water flow rate according to the deviation between the indoor temperature and its reference value. In this scenario, the optimal control of the SH system was difficult to realize, as the future disturbances (weather and occupancy), energy price, and the system dynamics were not able to be incorporated into the controllers. The MPC scenario proposed in this study, however, was able to realize the optimal control of the SH system. As shown in Fig. 4 b), during the optimization process, the perfect future disturbance predictions (weather and occupancy) together with a candidate manipulated variable trajectory (the water flow rate and the supply water temperature) were used as simulation inputs for the dynamic system model. An iterative simulation was conducted over a certain prediction horizon. The optimizer assessed the objective function for each simulation run and updated the candidate manipulated variable trajectory until an optimized trajectory was found. Afterwards, only the optimized manipulated variables at the first time step were used to control the SH system of the building. At the next time step, the MPC updated the initial states of the dynamic system model based on the feedback from the building and repeated the optimization [8]. 4 Results The model validation is presented firstly in this section, and then one-week simulation results of the two research scenarios were evaluated in terms of achieved indoor temperature, peak load shaving, and heating cost. 4.1 Model validation As explained in Section 2.1, the system model must be sufficiently precise to predict the thermal behaviour of the building. To ensure the accuracy of the embedded model of the MPC controller, the dynamic system model proposed in Section 2.1 was validated by one month's measured data from the university energy management platform. A Building Energy Management System and a web-based Energy Monitoring System were utilized for the data collection on the campus building energy use. Besides the total energy use of the entire campus, the real-time energy use data of each building were intensively monitored, such as the heat use and the electricity use [46]. Therefore, these measured data of the case building with an hourly resolution were available to validate the developed model. For the validation process, a reasonable initial guess was given for the state variables of the dynamic system model, and the mechanical ventilation and internal heat gains specified in Table 1 were used as inputs for the system model. Afterwards, the dynamic system model was simulated under the given weather conditions and tracked the reference values of indoor temperature by using the RBC control strategy. The indoor temperature reference values were defined as 21 °C from 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m., and 19 °C from 10:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m., according to the measured data and modified by the recommended values of the Norwegian standard SN-NSPEK 3031 [32]. The simulation was conducted in the Dymola environment. Finally, the simulated hourly heat rate was compared to the measured hourly heat rate. The validation results are presented in Fig. 5 . The measured and simulated hourly heat rate of the SH system showed the same trend. During working hours, the hourly heat rate was higher because of the higher airflow rate of the AHUs. During non-working hours or weekends, the hourly heat rate was lower due to the lower airflow rate of the AHUs caused by fewer occupants. To quantify the deviation between the simulated and the measured data, coefficient of variation of the root mean square error (CV(RMSE)) and normalized mean bias error (NMBE) were used according to the ASHRAE Guideline 14\u20132014 [49]. ASHRAE Guideline 14\u20132014 requires the validation criteria within ±30% for CV(RMSE) and within ±10% for NMBE when using hourly data. In this study, the CV(RMSE) and the NMBE were 16.9% and 0.4%, respectively, which satisfied the requirements. 4.2 Indoor air temperature The proposed MPC scenario was tested on the case building by simulation for one week (from 17th to 24th of January of 2018), and the simulation results for the achieved indoor air temperature are presented in this section. The simulation inputs including outdoor air temperature, internal heat gains and mechanical ventilation during this period are shown in Section Appendix A. The time period studied was a typical week during the heating season, with an average outdoor temperature of −5.4 °C and no holidays other than weekends. In addition, for the investigation of the MPC application in SH systems, a one-week simulation is a common time period. For example, both the research [50,51] adopted one week as the simulation period to investigate the MPC application in SH systems. Fig. 6 shows the indoor air temperature and the violation numbers of indoor temperature for different scenarios. The indoor temperature was collected every 10 min, and the violation number was counted when the difference between the indoor temperature and the reference value was higher than 0.5 K. According to the measured data and modified by the Norwegian standard SN-NSPEK 3031 [32], the indoor temperature reference values for the two research scenarios were both defined as 21 °C from 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. and 19 °C from 10:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m., as shown by the red solid line in Fig. 6 a). The P controller in the RBC scenario was tuned to achieve the required indoor temperature under all the conditions according to the principle of the actual building controller, as shown by the black dash line in Fig. 6 a). The proposed MPC scenario achieved better indoor temperature control performance than the conventional RBC. As shown by the blue solid line in Fig. 6 a), the over-heating phenomenon that occurred in the RBC scenario was effectively decreased in the MPC scenario, and the deviations between the indoor temperature and its reference values were decreased as well. Furthermore, as presented in Fig. 6 b), the violation numbers of the indoor temperature were also decreased from 374 to 153, with a reduction of nearly 59%, by the MPC control strategy. 4.3 Peak load shaving As explained in Section 2.2, the LDC based on a heat use's peak load is one of the most important components in the heating price model, and hence peak load shaving is a critical measure to reduce heating cost. The proposed MPC in this study incorporated the building thermal mass as TES to shift the heat loads away from peak hours and realize peak load shaving. Fig. 7 illustrates the heat rate for the RBC and the MPC scenario. In the RBC scenario, significant peak loads were observed around 8:00 a.m., when the reference values of the indoor temperature raised from 19 °C to 21 °C. Meanwhile, these peak hours coincided with the occupancy as well. The MPC scenario, however, handled this sudden rise of the reference indoor temperature by preheating the building 1 h ahead (from 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m.). Afterwards, the MPC control strategy slightly lowered its heat supply for the building to avoid the peak loads that appeared in the RBC scenario. Meanwhile, the indoor temperature of the MPC scenario was controlled at its acceptable range, as shown in Section 4.2. Therefore, the MPC scenario shifted part of its heat load from the peak hours to the non-peak hours, and this heat load shifting contributed to its peak load shaving effect. 4.4 Heating cost As described in Section 2.2, the heating price model used in this study only considered the LDC and the HDC. Therefore, the peak load and the heat use for the two scenarios are presented firstly in this section. Fig. 8 presents the peak load and heat use for two scenarios. As mentioned in Section 4.3, the passive thermal mass storage of the building was integrated into the MPC control strategy to shave the peak load of the SH system. Therefore, the MPC scenario presented a significant peak load shaving effect, and the peak load was decreased from 555 kW to 506 kW, a reduction of almost 8.8% compared to the benchmark scenario RBC, as shown in Fig. 8 a). In addition, due to the elimination of the over-heating phenomenon, heating use was saved as well in the MPC scenario. As presented in Fig. 8 b), the MPC scenario saved the heat use from 55.4 MWh to 53.9 MWh, with a heat use saving of around 2.8%. Finally, Fig. 9 presents the heating cost including the LDC and the HDC for different scenarios. In the MPC scenario, both the LDC and the HDC were reduced because of the peak load shaving and heat use saving effects brought by the MPC controller, as illustrated in Fig. 9. As a result, the MPC scenario saved the heating cost from 39 000 NOK to 37 500 NOK, a weekly heating cost saving of 3.8%. 5 Discussion The impact of building thermal mass on the MPC performance is discussed firstly in this section to get more generalized conclusions, followed by the limitation of this study. 5.1 Impact of building thermal mass The results from Section 4 assumed that the specific heat capacity of the building exterior opaque element was 175 000 J/m2·K, which was based on the recommended value for the \u2018Heavy Class\u2019 construction in the European standard ISO 52016\u20131 [31]. However, the construction materials of building exterior envelopes vary from case to case, and hence the building exterior envelopes may range from \u2018Very light Class\u2019 to \u2018Very heavy Class\u2019 construction. Different construction classes of building exterior envelopes may lead to different TES capacities when the building thermal mass is used as short-term TES, and thus the MPC performance may be influenced. To get more generalized conclusions, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to investigate the impact of building thermal mass on the performance of MPC by involving further scenarios, as listed in Table 3 . In Table 3, the specific heat capacities in different scenarios are set according to the reference values in the European standard ISO 52016\u20131 [31]. The only difference among each MPC scenario is the specific heat capacity settings of the building exterior opaque elements. Their corresponding benchmark scenarios RBC are introduced as well. Fig. 10 presents the indoor temperature violation numbers for different scenarios. All the MPC scenarios demonstrated better indoor temperature control performance, which was observed by the much lower violation numbers compared to the corresponding RBC scenarios. In addition, there was no obvious difference between each MPC scenario regarding the violation numbers of indoor temperature. Fig. 11 presents the peak load and heat use for different scenarios. As observed in Fig. 11 a), all the MPC scenarios, even the scenario MPC_1 with \u2018Very light\u2019 building exterior envelopes, took full advantage of the building thermal mass as TES to shift the heat load away from peak hours, which resulted in the peak load reduction ranging from 8.0% to 9.1% compared to their corresponding benchmark RBC scenarios. The MPC scenarios with larger building thermal mass tended to have a larger peak load shaving effect. However, in terms of heat use saving, all the MPC scenarios had almost the same ability, with savings of 2.7\u20132.8%, as presented in Fig. 11 b). Finally, Fig. 12 presents the heating cost for different scenarios. Similarly, all the MPC scenarios saved heating costs, which was brought by the reduction of the LDC and the HDC in the heating price model. However, due to the small difference of heat use saving in the MPC scenarios and the small share of the LDC in the heating price model compared to the HDC, the heating cost saving in different MPC scenarios demonstrated similar reductions, with the reductions changing from 3.6% to 3.9%. However, these reductions may present a larger difference if the share of the LDC in the heating price model is increased. Therefore, future work may consider how the heating price model influences the performance of the MPC controller. In addition, the objective function formulated in this study considered maintaining the indoor temperatures close to their setpoints as an important performance target, which may impair the potential of building thermal mass as TES, especially for the heavier building construction. Because the setpoint of indoor temperature was set as low as 19 °C during non-working hours (coincide with lower HDC price period). In contrast, the setpoint of indoor temperature was set as high as 21 °C during working hours (coincide with higher HDC price period). These indoor temperature setpoints were based on the recommended values in the Norwegian standard SN-NSPEK 3031 [32]. Due to this strict indoor temperature setting limitation, the MPC controller could not control the SH system to provide a bit more heat and store this heat in building thermal mass during the lower HDC price period, and then reuse this stored heat to reduce the heat output of SH system during the higher HDC price period. Therefore, future work may consider slacking the indoor temperature to a bit more flexible yet reasonable range, like setting as a range of 18 °C and 23 °C both in working and non-working hours, to fully unlock the flexibility of building thermal mass as TES. 5.2 Limitation This study considered a perfect future disturbance prediction, and hence the actual weather data and occupancy schedule were provided for all the MPC controllers to explore the theoretical potential of MPC. However, any prediction contains some uncertainties that may lead to deviations between the predicted and the actual information. In the real-world implementation of MPC, the MPC controller is based on the prediction of future disturbances to generate control actions while the building is acted by the actual disturbances. When the prediction information varies largely from the actual disturbances, the MPC controller receives inaccurate prediction information and may generate incorrect control actions, which may impair its performance [42]. Many researchers have confirmed this challenge as well and pointed out that providing accurate prediction and uncertainty information was crucial to achieving reliable MPC performance. For example, Oldewurtel et al. reported that the MPC controllers based on the weather forecast data did not work well, especially when the actual weather differed largely from the forecast [52]. Henze et al. investigated the effect of weather forecast uncertainty on the MPC performance. The result was that MPC seemed to be a promising building control approach, but only in the presence of perfect weather forecasts [53]. Therefore, to improve and achieve the reliable performance of MPC, the uncertainty of future disturbances prediction may be considered and addressed in future work. Meanwhile, a sensitivity analysis may be conducted to assess how sensitive different building construction classes are to future disturbance prediction uncertainty. 6 Conclusions In this study, an MPC strategy was proposed to realize the optimal control of the SH system, aiming to reduce the energy use, shave the peak load, and cut the heating costs with satisfying indoor temperature. Building thermal mass was incorporated into the MPC design to further improve the energy and economic performance of the SH system. A nonlinear system model was developed to be embedded into the MPC controller to predict the thermal behaviour of the building and the SH system. Considering the future disturbances and the energy price variations, the proposed MPC strategy controlled the output heat flow rate by optimizing the manipulated variables to achieve the maximum peak load shaving and heat use saving, while satisfying acceptable indoor temperatures. The proposed method was tested by the simulation method on a university building located in Norway. The MPC control strategy together with a conventional RBC strategy was evaluated in terms of achieved indoor temperature and heating cost. Compared to the conventional RBC, the proposed MPC controller shaved the heat peak load by 8.8% and saved the heat use by 2.8% during one week. In addition, the MPC controller demonstrated the weekly heating cost saving of 3.8%, while providing an improved thermal comfort level in terms of indoor temperature, with a reduction of 59% for the indoor temperature violations. To get more generalized conclusions, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to investigate the impact of building thermal mass on the MPC performance. Simulation results showed that even with \u2018Very light\u2019 building exterior envelopes, the MPC controller still took full advantage of the building thermal mass as TES to shift the heat load away from peak hours, although larger building thermal mass tended to have a larger peak load shaving effect. Finally, this study considered a perfect future disturbance prediction to explore the theoretical potential of the MPC controller.

        "dc:description": "Space heating accounts for a significant share of a building's energy use; moreover, occupants' desires for better thermal comfort may further increase the energy use and peak load of the space heating system, as well as its total energy cost. The goal of this study was to use an optimal control technique: model-based predictive controller, to improve the energy and economic performance of space heating systems with satisfying indoor temperature. The proposed optimal controller incorporated the dynamic energy prices, the disturbances from weather and occupancy, as well as a nonlinear system dynamic model that considered the building thermal mass as thermal energy storage. The model-based predictive controller was tested by simulation on a university building in central Norway, and its control performance was compared to a conventional rule-based control approach, which is currently employed by the case system. The model-based predictive controller's effectiveness was demonstrated by a 2.8% reduction in heat use, 8.8% shaving in peak load, 3.8% saving in heating cost, and a 59% drop in indoor temperature violation. Furthermore, a sensitivity study revealed that the model-based predictive controller still maintained high energy and economic performance even under lightweight building constructions with decreased building thermal mass.",
