The accurate demand prediction with high efficiency and advanced demand-side controller are essential for the enhancement of energy flexibility provided by buildings, whereas the current literature fails to present the mechanism on modelling development and demand-side control. This paper aims to deal with the complexity of building demand prediction with supervised machine learning method, including the multiple linear regression, the support vector regression and the backpropagation neural network. The regularization, adding the sum of the weights to the learning function, is utilized to improve the training speed and to solve the overfitting by eliminating the unnecessary connections with small weights. The configuration of the artificial neural network was presented, and sensitivity analysis has been conducted on the learning performance regarding different training times. Energy flexibilities of sophisticated building energy systems (including renewable system, electric and thermal demands and building services systems) were quantitatively characterised with a series of quantifiable indicators. Moreover, several advanced controllers have been developed and contrasted, in regard to the flexibility utilisation of building energy systems. Results showed that, the developed hybrid controller with short-term prediction through the cross-entropy function is more technically competitive than other controllers. With the implementation of the developed hybrid controller, the peak power of the grid importation can be reduced from 500.3 to 195 kW by 61%. This study formulates a data-driven model with an advanced machine learning algorithm for the accurate building demand prediction and a hybrid advanced controller with short-term prediction for the energy management, which are critical for the promotion of energy flexible buildings.

The socio-demographic dimension of the energy use in buildings has been studied by researchers [1\u20134]. The residential and thermal retrofits show promising potentials on economic viability of building energy system [5\u20137]. Building energy flexibility is the capability for the management of demand and generation, following the climate conditions, occupants\u2019 needs and grid requirements [8]. Demand side management response and control are most common solutions to improve the building energy flexibility and to enhance the resilience of smart grids to fluctuations in the energy supply. Over the past several years, the building energy flexibility has been evolved from the original conceptional definition to the flexibility quantification, and then to the flexibility enhancement solutions. With respect to the definition of the building energy flexibility, the IEAEBC Annex 67 has listed specific objectives for promoting future energy flexible buildings [9]. To investigate the preparation and the energy response for buildings participating in both the demand response and energy storages [9], the flexibility has been regarded as one of key targets for smart readiness indicator regarding both smart buildings and smart communities. Table 1 summarizes the key performance indicators (KPIs), together with flexibility enhancement solutions. It can be noticed that, most studies are mainly focused on the energy flexibility of thermal energy systems, whereas limited studies are on the integrated thermal and electrical storage systems in buildings. The demand side management (DSM) is an effective strategy for the energy flexibility improvement. Table 2 listed an overview of the demand side management for energy flexible buildings. Drysdale et al. [15] studied the impact of the flexible domestic demand on the energy balance by predicting both the daily flexible load and annual domestic demand in 2030 in the United Kingdom. They indicated that, under the current market structure, the low engagement of the consumers due to less economic feedback limited the effective access to the flexible domestic demand. Lizana et al. [16] developed a novel building model for the multi-criteria assessment concerning the evolution of both the future energy demand and electricity tariff. Based on their results, the electricity cost of end-users could be reduced by 20% in the energy flexible building, and the environmental emission remained constant, despite of the increase in final energy consumption. In Barcelona, Spain, Péan et al. [17] investigated the influence of active demand response (ADR) on energy flexibility through the modulation of both start time of ADR events and set-point temperature of the heating system. Based on their results, the 2-h ADR event with the set-point modulation of 1 °C could provide the maximum flexibility capacity. Aduda et al. [18] studied the energy flexibility through the demand power, the energy consumption, and the indoor comfort. The energy flexibility provided by the DSM indicated that, the flexibility would become quite complicated, when considering the indoor air quality and thermal comfort. Building energy flexibility with the consideration of economic cost has also been investigated with respect to different technical solutions [11]. Based on their results, the load shifting based on DSM would result in zero operational costs of household appliances, whereas thermal storage would contrarily increase the operational costs due to energy losses [11]. For the enhancement of building energy flexibility, the development of advanced controllers from the demand side management plays a significant role in the robust control of heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems [19,20] and home energy management scheduling for smart\u2010home appliances [21]. Furthermore, the accurate energy demand prediction considering the uncertainty is important for the management of district-level urban energy systems through the development of hierarchical approach [22]. The uncertainty analysis of has been conducted by the academic researchers, in respect to building demands and renewable generations. From the perspective of renewable generations, Salkuti [23] conducted the multi-objective optimization, incorporating uncertainties of renewable generations and forecast errors of demand predictions. From their results, the proposed optimization approach was effective in terms of optimizing multiple objectives with uncertainties and reducing the local pollutant emission. In order to provide an optimal renewable energy portfolio of different renewable energies under uncertain and imprecise conditions, Hocine et al. [24] developed a multi-segment fuzzy goal programming to provide more flexibility to building owners. From their results, the proposed model was effective in terms of achieving the sustainable development. From the perspective of building energy demand, Lu et al. [25] showed that the uncertainty of total building energy consumption was around 14%. Walid et al. [26] conducted the uncertainty analysis on occupants\u2019 behavior and building envelope materials using the Monte Carlo method. The building energy demand was highly dependent on the uncertainty of occupant behavior in hot climate regions, but on parameters of building envelope in cold climate regions. Zhang et al. [27] proposed a method to optimize the overall performance with optimal design solutions under high-level uncertainty. From their results, when implementing the proposed method, the number of Monte Carlos simulations could be reduced by 97.8%, together with the predicted error less than 3.5%. It can be noticed that, there are limited studies focusing on the development of demand-side controllers to improve the building energy flexibility, considering the high-level uncertainty of building energy systems. Nowadays, the impact of energy storage-based control strategies on the building energy flexibility has attracted researchers\u2019 attention. Finck et al. [28] comparatively studied the impact of different controllers (i.e., the model predictive control, MPC, and the reinforcement learning, RL) on the promotion of energy flexible buildings [29]. Unlike the MPC, the controller based on the RL neither possesses nor learns a system dynamics model. By contrast, the controller based the RL learns from past energy performance behavior [29] and reduces the computational complexity. Pedersen et al. [30] investigated the difference between the centralized economic model predictive control (E-MPC) and the decentralized E-MPC, from perspectives of the end-user cost savings, the CO2 emissions and the load shifting impact. From their results, depending on the energy efficiency of retrofit scenarios, the cost saving of end-users could be increased to 6% and the CO2 emissions could be reduced by 3%. Furthermore, the decentralized E-MPC was more feasible than the centralized E-MPC scheme due to the simpler structural configuration. It can be noticed that, the comparative analysis between different control strategies fails to consider the multi-dimensional energy flexibility from both energy demand and surplus renewable generation. The impact of advanced control strategies on the multi-dimensional energy flexibility is worthy to be well investigated. With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, machine learning technology has been widely used in building energy systems, including the accurate prediction of building energy demand [31\u201333], demand side management [34], model predictive control [35], uncertainty analysis [36,37] and the surrogate model development for system optimsation [38\u201341]. Table 3 presents an overview for the application of machine learning technology in building energy systems. In respect to the prediction of building energy demand, Wang et al. [31] comparatively studied the accuracy of different adaptive learning models. From their results, the Gaussian mixture model regression was superior to adaptive filter methods in terms of adapting to the nonlinearity of building performance. However, the developed data-driven models were difficult to be converged with optimal solutions, regarding multi-dimensional input variables. Guo et al. [32] comparatively studied the accuracy of energy demand prediction from different models. From their results, compared to other learning models, the extreme learning machine model was more accurate for the demand prediction. The machine learning method can also be implemented in building energy system for the development of advanced control strategies. For instance, in order to develop an occupancy-prediction-based cooling control strategy to realise the building energy savings, Penga et al. [33] adopted both unsupervised and supervised learning methods to predict the indoor occupancy. The learning results were implemented in controlling the room setpoints. From their results, compared to the conventionally-scheduled cooling systems, the developed occupancy-prediction-based cooling control could realize the energy saving of 7\u201352%. Furthermore, the machine learning technology can be used for the demand side management [34], model predictive control (MPC) [35], uncertainty analysis [36,37] and the surrogate model development for the system optimsation [38\u201340]. Pallonettoet al. [34] adopted the predictive-based method for the control of heat pump integrated thermal storages. With the implementation of the predictive-based (machine learning) approach, electricity end-use cost and carbon emission were only 41.8% and only 37.9% of the reference case. In order to reduce the complexity and the implementation cost of optimization-based control algorithms, such as the model predictive control (MPC), Drgoňa et al. [35] developed a simplified control strategy with the implementation of learning results from the MPC using machine learning algorithms. From their results, compared to the sophisticated MPC, the developed simplified control strategy could decrease the complexity without sacrificing the predictive performance. Zheng et al. [40] developed a generic optimization methodology for the multivariant optimization of an aerogel glazing system. According to the results, the developed data-driven model was efficient and accurate, and the developed surrogate model could be flexibly integrated with advanced optimsation algorithms for the system performance enhancement. In order to implement research results in real applications, researchers are focused on the occupancy-prediction-based cooling control [33], the learning results from the MPC to simplify the MIMO control problems [35] and the implementation of surrogate model in advanced optimisation algorithms [40,42]. It can be noticed that, most studies in the academia are focused on the application of the machine learning technology in building energy predictions for the improvement of energy prediction accuracy, whereas there are quite limited studies on the development of advanced controllers, incorporating the predicted future renewable generation and demand in the real-time energy management. Several scientific gaps can be noticed, and these scientific gaps will be covered to form the novelty of this study. In the academic literature, most studies are mainly focused on the energy flexibility of thermal energy systems, whereas limited studies are on the quantification method of energy flexibility provided by integrated thermal and electrical storage systems in buildings. Regarding the sophisticated building energy systems, there is no general flexibility quantification method, comprehensively considering thermal-electrical energy forms, solar-to-electrical and electrical-to-thermal conversions, cooling, heating and electrical energy storages, and flexible energy control strategies. Secondly, the sophisticated nonlinearity and complexity of building energy predictions, involving with modelling development and computational load, have not been properly and effectively solved, especially incorporating multi-level parameters\u2019 uncertainty. Accurate predictions of building energy with simplified models using machine learning method are full of promising prospects, in terms of promoting energy flexible buildings. Thirdly, the development of advanced controllers with short-term building energy predictions under high-level scenario uncertainties, has not been investigated in the academia. The impact of advanced controllers on the building energy flexibility is worthy to be well investigated. Scenario parameters are correlated to the real-time system operation, including the meteorological parameters (ambient and solar air temperature), the supply and return chilled water temperatures, the indoor air set-point temperature, and so on. All these scenario parameters have uncertainties during the design stage due to the unmeasurable and the stochastic characteristics. The contributions of this study include: (1) energy flexibility quantifications of integrated building energy systems (including renewable systems, electric and thermal storages, and building services systems), with a series of multi-dimensional energy flexibility indicators; (2) the development of simplified models for short-term building energy predictions with high efficiency and accuracy; (3) the development of advanced controllers, with the implementation of short-term building energy predictions, for the building energy flexibility enhancement. The novelty of this study can be briefly summarised as follows. 1) Energy flexibility of integrated building energy systems (including renewable systems, electric and thermal storages, and building services systems), was quantified with a series of multi-dimensional energy flexibility indicators, systematically considering different energy forms, advanced energy conversions, diversified energy storage systems, and flexible energy control strategies; 2) A surrogate model was developed to simplify the sophisticated nonlinearity and complexity of the building energy prediction. The adopted method for the surrogate model is the supervised machine learning technique. As the building energy systems in TRNSYS 18 are quite complicated during both modelling and simulation processes, the motivation for the surrogate model is to improve the computational efficiency without sacrificing the accuracy; 3) By driving the surrogate model for the short-term prediction of building energy performances, the predicted control signal was implemented in the real-time energy management system, forming advanced controllers, to enhance the building energy flexibility. The motivation and principle of advanced controller are to match the renewable generation and the building energy demand, through the smart operations of building appliances, HVAC devices and indoor air set-point temperature. In the latter part of the paper, Section 2 presents the configuration of the artificial neural network with different data-driven learning algorithms, the modelling accuracy assessment criteria, and a generic energy flexibility quantification methodology. In Section 3, meteorological parameters and building energy systems are briefly introduced. Thereafter, the simulated cases and discussion of results are given in Section 4. The conclusions are drawn in the Section 5. 2 Methodology In the academia, machine learning approaches to deal with building energy consumption have attracted increasing interest, due to the simple structure of the model [43] and the accurate prediction results [43]. In this study, an in-depth study on the supervised machine learning method to multi-level evaluation criteria, has been conducted, with respect to different learning algorithms and different learning times. Furthermore, an advanced controller was developed to improve the energy flexibility with the implementation of short-term demand predictions. The research results can provide effective solutions for the promotion of energy flexible buildings through the intelligent management of building services systems. Regarding the building energy prediction, the overfitting was solved, together with the improvement of the training speed, by discarding the unnecessary connections with small weights. Comparative analysis of the learning performance has been conducted with respect to four learning functions, including the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) function, the batch function, the sum of the square error function and the cross-entropy function. By implementing the data-driven model for the building energy demand prediction, four different controllers have been developed for the demand side management, including the rule-based controller, the predictive controller, the iterative feedback controller and the hybrid controller. The building energy flexibility has been investigated and contrasted, in terms of the technical effectiveness assessment when implementing the developed controllers. 2.1 Data-driven learning algorithm In respect to the supervised learning, the training is a procedure that updates the weight matrix to decrease the difference between the actual data and model\u2019s output. The output objective is the multiplication of all weighted samples with multi-dimensional inputs [44]. In this study, regarding the simplified single-layer and the multi-layer neural network, comparative analysis has been conducted with respect to four typical learning functions, including the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) function and the batch function for the single-layer neural network, the sum of the square error and the cross-entropy function for the multi-layer neural network: (1) e = m i n | d - x × W | Fig. 1 presents the generic methodology in this study. The nonlinear component-based building energy system was modelled in the TRNSYS 18 [45]. The thermal energy storages were modelled by the Type 534 [46]. The detailed information of the building energy system in the high-rise office building will be introduced in the upcoming Section 3.2. The supervised machine learning was implemented and evaluated in a MATLAB environment. The construction of the neural network and the implemented learning functions will be introduced in the upcoming Sections 2.1.1 and 2.1.2. The column vector of weights after the machine learning process can be obtained and then be implemented in the scenario with high-level uncertainty for the short-term prediction. The short-term prediction results through the data-driven model will be implemented in the development of the controller as shown in Fig. 1(b). The dynamic training process is shown in Fig. 1(c). As shown in Fig. 1(c), during each training process, the learning engine calculates the error between the actual data and the predicted outputs, and then adjusts the weight vectors to minimize the error. 2.1.1 The single-layer neural network The SGD function updates the weight using the following formal formula: (2) w i j ( n ) = w i j ( n - 1 ) + α x j ( n ) [ d ( n ) - x j ( n ) × w i j ( n - 1 ) ] where n is the training times; w i j ( n ) and w i j ( n - 1 ) are the weight vectors of the nth and the (n-1)th training; x j (n) is the input parameter; α is the learning rate (0\u20131), which determines the changing rate of the weight. In this study, the learning rate is 0.9 [47] for the demonstration purpose. The sensitivity analysis of the learning rate to the learning performance is not the focus of this study and the reader is suggested to refer to the [47] for the specific sensitivity analysis. In addition to the SGD function, the batch function can also be implemented in the artificial neural network with the averaged weight update calculation, as shown in the following formula: (3) w i j ( n ) = w i j ( n - 1 ) + 1 N ∑ n = 1 N [ α x j ( n ) [ d ( n ) - x j ( n ) × w i j ( n - 1 ) ] 2.1.2 The multi-layer neural network A multi-layer neural network was also developed to solve the nonlinear modelling problem. The performance of the multi-layer neural network was thereafter compared and contrasted with the single-layer neural network. However, one of the most challenging problems of the multi-layer neural network is the error identification of the hidden layer. The back-propagation algorithm is popularized as it provides a systematic method to determine the error of the hidden nodes [48], as shown in Eq. (4): (4) e i ( 1 ) = w 2 T δ i where e i (1) is the error of ith node in the hidden layer. The superscript (1) indicates the interface between the input variables to the 1st hidden layer. δ i is the error of the ith node between the actual data and the predicted outputs. w 2 T is the transpose vector. The subscript 2 indicates the interface between the hidden layer and the output results. In order to test the impact of different training rules on the learning results, two learning functions related to the multi-layer neural network have been implemented and contrasted, i.e., the sum of the square error and the cross-entropy function, as shown in Eqs. (6) and (7): (5) w i j ( n ) = w i j ( n - 1 ) + α x j ( n ) J (6) J = 1 2 [ ∑ i = 1 N [ d i ( n ) - x j ( n ) × w i j ( n - 1 ) ] 2 + λ ( ∑ | w | ) 2 ] (7) J = ∑ i = 1 N [ - d i ( n ) × l n ( x j ( n ) × w i j ( n - 1 ) ) - ( 1 - d i ( n ) ) × l n ( 1 - x j ( n ) × w i j ( n - 1 ) ) ] + λ 1 2 ( ∑ | w | ) 2 Fig. 2 demonstrates the detailed configuration of the supervised machine learning model. There are three layers in the formulated artificial neural network, including one input layer with 10 nodes, one hidden layer with 70,080 nodes, and one output layer with 1 node. In the input layer, there are 10 scenario parameters, including the the ambient temperature, the solar air temperature, the supplied and return chilled water temperatures in the air-handling unit cooling system, the power consumption of the air-handling unit cooling chiller, the supply and return chilled water temperatures in the space cooling system, the power consumption of the space cooling chiller, the internal gain and the indoor air set-point temperature. As the time step is 0.125 h, the number of each variable during the one-year operation is 70,080 (8760 h). The input variable is a 70080 × 10 matrix. The hidden layer is the matrix with the dimension of 70080 × 1. The output layer is the matrix with the dimension of 70080 × 1. 2.2 The modelling accuracy evaluation In order to comparatively investigate the impact of different learning functions on the learning accuracy, the average of training error (AE) of each modelling was calculated as shown below: (8) A E = 1 N ∑ i = 1 N ( d i - y i ) 2 where d i and y i are the actual data and the predicted outputs of the ith node. In order to assess the accuracy for building demand prediction, five statistical indicators were adopted as shown in Eqs. (9)\u2013(13), including the coefficient of determination (R2), the mean absolute error (MAE), the root mean square error (RMSE), the normalized mean bias error (NMBE), and the coefficient of variation or the root mean-square error (CV-RMSE). According to the ASHRAE Guideline 14 [49], the modelling accuracy of the hourly data prediction is less than 10% for the NMBE and less than 30% for the CV-RMSE. (9) R 2 = 1 - ∑ i = 1 N ( y i - d i ) 2 ∑ i = 1 N ( d i - d ¯ ) 2 (10) M A E = ∑ i = 1 N | y i - d i | N (11) R M S E = ∑ i = 1 N ( y i - d i ) 2 N (12) N M B E = 1 N ∑ i = 1 N ( y i - d i ) d ¯ (13) C V - R M S E = ∑ i = 1 N ( y i - d i ) 2 N d ¯ where d ¯ is the average value of the actual data. 2.3 The development of advanced controller and building energy flexibility assessment The ultimate objective for accurately predicting the building energy demand is to efficiently utilize the building energy flexibility with advanced controllers. Fig. 3 demonstrates a holistic overview of procedure for the flexibility quantification with respect to different advanced controllers, considering the uncertainty of the scenario parameters. The first step is the short-term prediction of building energy demand under high-level scenario uncertainty. The second step is the development of advanced controllers, in respect to different signals. The third step is to implement the developed advanced controllers in the TRNSYS 18 simulation platform for the demand side management. The control items include: (1) the lighting and the equipment, (2) the working chillers, (3) the internal shading, and (4) the adjustment of indoor air set-point temperature. The fourth step is the building energy flexibility assessment. The rule-based controller follows the signal between the current building energy demand and the current renewable generation (called the REe-demand signal). For instance, at the current situation, when the renewable generation is lower than the building energy demand, the smart-home appliance system will be activated, and the power of the lighting and the equipment will be reduced to 0.9 of its pre-set values. Meanwhile, for electricity consumption savings, the capacity of working chillers will be operated to be reduced to 0.8 of its pre-set values. The internal shading will be activated to reduce the transmitted solar radiation. Last but not the least, the indoor air set-point temperature will be increased to 26 °C, to reduce the cooling load. When the renewable generation is higher than the building energy demand, the powers of the lighting and the equipment are equal to its pre-set values. Meanwhile, in order to store the excessive renewable energy through thermal storage tanks, the capacity of working chillers will be operated to be increased to 1.2 of its pre-set values. The indoor air set-point temperature is 24 °C, to guarantee the indoor thermal comfort. The short-term predictions of renewable generations and building energy demands are conducted, using the data-driven learning model. The predictive controller is instructed by the current and short-term predicted REe-demand signals. The motivation for the short-term prediction is that, the predicted REe-demand signal can be implemented in the controller to flexibly manage the building energy system. For instance, if the occupants can know the renewable generation and the building energy demand next day in advance, the decision-maker can make more reasonable decisions and preparations on the management of the renewable generation and the building energy, at the current stage. To be more specific, when there is insufficient renewable energy next day, the decision-maker will adopt solutions for electricity consumption savings. For example, the smart-home appliance is activated to reduce the power of the lighting and the equipment to 0.9 of its pre-set values. The capacity of working chillers will be reduced to 0.8 of its pre-set values. The internal shading will be activated to reduce the transmitted solar radiation. The indoor air set-point temperature will be increased to be 26 °C, to reduce the cooling load. This predictive controller can be useful to enhance the energy flexibility from the perspective of the long-term system operation. The iterative feedback controller is instructed by the iterative signal at the current time step, which is generated by the Type 22 in TRNSYS 18. The iterative feedback controller dynamically calculates the control signal (iterative signal) to keep the controlled variable (such as the building energy demand) almost the same as the set-point (such as the renewable generation). The purpose of this iterative feedback controller is to match the renewable generation and the building energy demand, through the smart operation of the building appliances, the HVAC devices and indoor air set-point temperature. The control signal is generated by TRNSYS iterations for the accurate set-point tracking. The readers are suggested to refer to [50] for more detailed information of the accurate set-point tracking mechanism. The hybrid controller is the combination of both the predictive controller and the iterative feedback controller. In other words, the hybrid controller is instructed by three signals, including the iterative signal at the current time, the current and short-term REe-demand signals. The control objectives include the power of lighting and equipment, LL&e\u2019, the set-point temperature of the air-conditioning system, Tset, and the chiller capacity, Pchiller. The power of lighting and equipment, LL&e\u2019, the set-point temperature of the air-conditioning system, Tset, and the chiller capacity, Pchiller, are adjusted following the formulas as shown in Step 3, Fig. 3, depending on the current building energy demand and the current renewable generation. For instance, when the current building energy demand is higher than current renewable generation, the set-point temperature of the air-conditioning system, Tset, is adjusted to be 18 °C for heating, and 26 °C for cooling. The building energy flexibility has been investigated to comparatively investigate the effectiveness of developed controllers. The building energy flexibility indicators are developed by ourselves, regarding the dynamic operations of hybrid energy storages and advanced energy conversions. The on-site flexible surplus renewable fraction ratio, OFRe, indicates the proportion of the surplus renewable energy which is the forced electricity during the REe surplus period, E forced,e + . The forced electricity during the REe surplus period indicates how much flexible electricity can be driven by the on-site surplus renewable electricity. For instance, in order to increase the renewable energy penetration in the building energy system, the surplus renewable energy can be either stored in the battery or be stored in the thermal storage tank with the electricity-to-thermal conversion, instead of being exported to the electric grid. The on-site flexible electric load fraction, OFLe, indicates the proportion of the basic electric load which is covered by the flexible electricity. For instance, regarding the hybrid building energy system with high-level flexibility, the basic electric load of the building can be self-covered by the delayed energy from the diversified energy storage systems, without activating the operation devices, such as chillers and heat pumps, or importing electricity from the electric grid. The inflexible energy (Einflexible,e), as shown in Eq. (14), includes both the electricity imported from the electric grid, Eimp,e, and the delayed electricity from the battery during the renewable surplus period, E d e l a y e d , b a t t e r y - . (14) E i n f l e x i b l e , e = E i m p , e + E d e l a y e d , b a t t e r y - (15) O F R e = E f o r c e d , e + ∫ 0 t e n d M A X [ ( G R E e ( t ) - L e ( t ) ) , 0 ] · d t (16) O F L e = 1 - E i n f l e x i b l e , e ∫ 0 t e n d L e ( t ) · d t = 1 - E i m p , e + E d e l a y e d , b a t t e r y - ∫ 0 t e n d L e ( t ) · d t where the G R E e ( t ) indicates the renewable generation at the time t. The L e (t) is the electric demand. To investigate the capability of the building to shift the flexible electricity to the renewable surplus period, the forced flexibility factor, FFforced,e, is proposed during both charging and discharging processes. The FFforced,e, as shown in Eq. (17), indicates the capability of the energy flexible building for shifting the forced electricity from the renewable shortage period (tshort) to the renewable surplus period (tsurp). (17) F F f o r c e d , e = E f o r c e d , e + - E f o r c e d , e - E f o r c e d , e + + E f o r c e d , e - where the E forced,e - is the forced electricity during the REe shortage period. The FFforced,e varies from −1 to 1. The larger the FFforced,e is, the more flexible the system will be. 3 Case study-office building in Hong Kong 3.1 Meteorological and design parameters of the HVAC system The meteorological parameters in Hong Kong are shown in Fig. 4 . As shown in Fig. 4(a), the total horizontal radiation is during the daytime, with the fluctuation range between 0 and 1.2 kW/m2. The evenly distributed wind speed fluctuates from 0 to 16 m/s, with several spikes, as shown in Fig. 4(b). The monthly-dependent solar radiation fluctuates from 63.6 to 168 kWh/m2.mon. The 30-floor high-rise office building was studied, with the geometrical size at 20 m (length) × 20 m (width) × 3 m (height) for each floor. The parameters of building envelopes are listed in Table 4 , according to [51]. Occupant density and infiltration rate are 13 m2/person and 0.288 air change rate per hour (ACH) [51]. The maximum heat gain from each person is 126 W [51]. The window to wall ratio is 20% in this simulated office building. The mechanical ventilation system was designed with the supplied fresh air change rate of 0.72 ACH. A total fresh air hydronic air handling unit (AHU) system was designed with a supply air temperature of 18 °C. The rest cooling load was covered by a designed space cooling system. The rated capacity of the AHU cooling chiller was 293 kW (Carrier 30RB302 with the nominal COP at 2.8) [52], and the rated capacity of the space cooling chiller was 506 kW (Carrier 30RB522 with the nominal COP at 2.6) [52]. Performance data of air-cooled chiller systems is shown in the Fig. 15, Appendix, in respect to different dry-bulb temperatures and different chilled water temperatures. 3.2 Lighting system and energy storages The maximum lighting power was 15 W/m2, and the dynamic lighting energy consumption was the multiplication of the maximum lighting power with a coefficient between 0 and 1 [51]. Three thermal storage tanks, as listed in Table 5 , were designed to cover the AHU cooling load, the space cooling load, both the hot water heating and the hydronic heating load, respectively. The volumes of three thermal storage tanks are 25 m3 for the air handling unit cooling storage tank (ACST), 25 m3 for the space cooling storage tank (SCST) and 0.45 m3 for the hot water storage tank. Thermal storage tanks are modeled by Type 534, which is available from the component library [46]. The model for the battery was self-developed, following the principle of energy balance. 3.3 Renewable systems To cover the energy demand of the formulated high-rise office building, the building integrated photovoltaics (BIPVs) were designed. The BIPVs were installed in the vertical building façades, and the area of the BIPVs on the four facades was 6140 m2. The efficiency of the BIPV cells is 14.3% under standard testing conditions, i.e., reference temperature of 25 °C and reference radiation of 1000 W/m2. Parameters of the renewable energy system in the TRNSYS simulation are listed in Table 6 . 4 Results and discussions 4.1 The impact of training functions on the learning results Fig. 5 demonstrates the learning results of the energy demand regarding different learning functions in January. As shown in the Fig. 5, compared to the single-layer neural network, the multi-layer neural network with the back-propagation algorithm is more accurate. This can be indicated by the higher coefficient of determination (R2) in the multi-layer neural network than the R2 of the single-layer neural network. The reason is that, due to the nonlinearity of the building energy system, the building energy demand is nonlinearly affected by multi-dimensional affecting factors, such as the ambient temperature, the solar air temperature, the supplied chilled water temperature, power consumptions of chillers, the internal gains and the indoor air setpoint temperature. Therefore, the multi-layer neural network is more accurate than the single-layer neural network in terms of dealing with the nonlinearity of the building energy system. Fig. 6 demonstrates the learning results of the energy demand regarding different learning functions in July. As shown in the Fig. 6(c) and (d), the cross-entropy function performs better than the sum of the square error function with the R2 of 0.99. The reason is that the cross-entropy function, as shown in Eq. (7), is much more sensitive to the error than the quadratic function as shown in Eq. (6). As a result, the cross-entropy function will yield more accurate learning results than the sum of the square error function. In order to obviously demonstrate the training speed and the learning accuracy, the average training errors are shown in Fig. 7 . As shown in Fig. 7, the SGD function learns faster and more accurate than the batch function. Meanwhile, the cross-entropy training reduces the training error at a much faster rate. In summary, the cross-entropy function is more competitive and robust than other algorithms in terms of predicting the energy demand. 4.2 Discussion of the training times and the prediction accuracy In this study, as the investigated building was located in the cooling dominated region, Hong Kong, only the variables with the most significant features were selected for the short-term prediction, including the ambient temperature, the solar air temperature, the supply and return water temperature of the AHU and the space cooling system, the power consumptions of both chillers, the internal gains and the indoor air setpoint temperature. However, the control variables related to the heating systems were neglected, which might result in the inaccuracy of the short-term prediction during the heating periods, such as January, November and December. One technical solution (i.e., the enhancement of the training times) was proposed to compensate the shortcomings of incomplete input variables for the energy prediction. Comparative and parametrical analyses have been conducted during heating periods, such as January, November and December, with respect to different training times. As shown in Fig. 8 , the 1000 times training process will result in the inaccuracy of building energy demand prediction during the heating periods, as shown in Fig. 8(a), (c), and (e). The reason is due to the lack of the heating energy related input variables. By increasing the training times to 5000, as shown in Fig. 8(b), (d), and (f), the building energy demand prediction results are more accurate. It can be concluded that, the lack of the input factors will result in inaccuracy for building demand predictions, whereas the increase of training times can increase the prediction accuracy of the building energy demand. The increase of training times is an effective solution for the accurate prediction of building energy demand and is worthy to be widely popularized, in respect to the incomplete and incomprehensive considerations of all impact factors of the sophisticated building energy system, especially with various integrated subsystems. Based on the algorithm as shown in Section 2, the data-driven models learnt from the supervised rules and adaptively adjusted weighted coefficients to generate the accurate prediction results. The accuracy indicators between the predicted and the simulated building energy demand from the TRNSYS 18 for each month are listed in Table 7 . It can be concluded that, for each month, the cross-entropy function can meet the requirement of the ASHRAE Guideline 14 [49], i.e., the modelling accuracy of the hourly data prediction result is less than 10% for the NMBE and less than 30% for the CV-RMSE. Furthermore, the building energy demand prediction results are more accurate during the cooling months than the heating months. This can be indicated by the lower NMBE, CV-RMSE, MAE and RMSE, and the higher R2 in cooling months than heating months. It is noteworthy that, the increase of training times is an effective solution to improve the building demand prediction performance. For instance, by increasing the training time from 1000 to 5000 in December, the R2 is increased from 0.55 to 0.96. 4.3 Discussion of the advanced energy controller and the building energy flexibility The Sections 4.1 and 4.2 demonstrate the feasibility and the robustness of the developed data-driven model using the machine learning technique in terms of the building demand prediction. In this section, new controllers were developed by implementing the predicted results to flexibly control the hybrid building energy system. Comparative analysis has been conducted regarding different controllers, including (1) the rule-based controller; (2) the predictive controller; (3) the iterative feedback controller; (4) the hybrid controller. Compared to the rule-based controller and the iterative feedback controller, both the predictive controller and the hybrid controller additionally consider the uncertainty (disturbance) of scenario parameters and the short-term prediction of energy demand through the data-driven model. Scenario parameters indicate the parameters that are correlated to the real-time operation, including the meteorological parameters (ambient and solar air temperature), the supplied and return chilled water temperatures, the indoor air set-point temperature and so on. All these scenario parameters have uncertainties during the design stage due to the unmeasurable and the stochastic characteristics. In the academic world, the normal distribution was adopted to characterize uncertainties, such as the uncertainties in infiltration by Hopfe [56] and the uncertainties in building design parameters by Huang et al. [57]. In this study, the uncertainties (disturbance) of scenario parameters were assigned with normal distributions. As the purpose of this section is to present a generic methodology for the development of advanced controllers and to test its effectiveness and robustness in terms of the enhancement of building energy flexibility, the assumed normal distribution of the scenario parameters is just for the demonstration purpose. The evolution of scenario parameters from the real applications needs to be experimentally collected in our future studies. However, this is out of the scope of this study. Fig. 9 shows the carpet plot of the hourly building energy demand when implementing different controllers. Compared to the rule-based controller as shown in Fig. 9(a), by implementing the predictive controller, the building energy demand can be drastically reduced, as shown in Fig. 9(b). In our case study, the peak power is reduced from 517.8 to 404.4 kW by 21.9%. The underlying mechanism is that, according to the control principle as shown in Fig. 3, the implementation of control signal from predictive controller can contribute to the flexible management of the lighting and equipment system, the internal shading, the indoor air setpoint temperature and the operation of chiller. Furthermore, by implementing the hybrid controller in the energy management system, the peak power of the building energy demand is significantly reduced to 382.8 kW, as shown in Fig. 9(d). Compared to the continuous distribution of the carpet plot as shown in Fig. 9(b), the hybrid controller can disperse the peak power distribution, as shown in Fig. 9(d), which is indicated by the discrete distribution of the carpet plot. It is noteworthy that, the iterative feedback controller would contrarily increase the peak power to 894.1 kW, as shown in Fig. 9(c), which makes the iterative feedback controller less competitive than others. The underlying mechanism resulting in the ineffectiveness of the iterative feedback controller will be discussed in Fig. 11. Fig. 10 shows the peak power of the building energy demand on 1st July. As shown in Fig. 10, the time-duration of the peak power is significantly reduced by implementing the hybrid controller in the energy management system. For instance, compared to the time-duration of the peak power from 14 to 16 hr in the predictive controller, the peak power of building energy demand only appears at 15.5 hr in the hybrid controller. Moreover, by adopting the predictive controller, the time-duration of the peak power of building energy demand can be shifted from around 6 hr (non-renewable generation period) to the 14\u201316 hr (the maximum renewable generation period). The reason is that, as shown in Fig. 3, the building energy demand is shifted from the renewable shortage period to the renewable surplus period when implementing the short-term prediction of the REe-demand signal in the building energy management system. In order to further investigate the mechanism of the peak power shifting via the implementation of different controllers, the power consumption of the chiller on 1st, July and the electric power of lighting and equipment on 31st, December are plotted in Fig. 11 . As shown in Fig. 11(a), compared to the rule-based controller, the iterative feedback controller can reduce the peak power by interactively controlling the operation of the chiller on 1st, July. Regarding the iterative feedback controller, there is a spike of both the chiller power consumption and the electric power of lighting and equipment. Compared to the rule-based controller and the predictive controller, the iterative feedback controller will result in more frequent fluctuations of the power consumption curve. The reason is due to the frequent error tracking signal via the secant method [50] when searching for the objective point within the tolerance. By implementing the short-term predicted REe-demand signal, the predictive controller can reduce the chiller power consumption. Furthermore, by integrating the iterative control signal with the predictive controller, the hybrid controller can further reduce the peak power and the electricity consumption of the chiller. In regard to the electric power of lighting and equipment as shown in Fig. 11(b), both the predictive and the hybrid controllers can reduce the peak power of lighting and equipment. Fig. 12 shows the evolution of the dynamic power of grid importation in respect to different controllers. Compared to the rule-based controller as shown in Fig. 12(a), the grid importation is reduced by implementing the predictive controller as shown in Fig. 12(b). This can be indicated by the sparser distribution of the grid importation in the predictive controller than the rule-based controller. The underlying mechanism is that, according to the control principle as shown in Fig. 3, the implementation of REe-demand signal at next time step can shift the surplus renewable energy from the current to the future for the domestic usage, and improve the self-consumption of renewable energy. Moreover, the hybrid controller can reduce the time-duration of the peak power, which is indicated by the discrete distribution of the carpet plot as shown in Fig. 12(d). As shown in Fig. 13 , the peak power of the grid importation can be reduced from 500.3 kW to 272 kW when adopting the predictive controller and further to 195 kW when adopting the hybrid controller. In addition, as shown in Fig. 12(c), the iterative feedback controller would contrarily increase the peak power of the grid importation, which makes the iterative feedback controller less competitive than others. As shown in Fig. 14 , compared to the rule-based controller with the OFLe of 0.25, the model predictive controller can increase the OFLe to 0.31, indicating that 31% of electric demand can covered by the flexible electricity. The reason is due to the decrease of the electric demand from 128 to 104 kWh/m2.a, when implementing the short-term predicted REe-demand signal in controlling the energy management system. Meanwhile, by implementing the iterative feedback controller, the OFLe can be increased to 0.45, together with the increase of the OFRe and the FFforced,e to 0.33 and −0.01, respectively. These indicate that, by implementing the iterative signal in the demand side management, more surplus renewable energy can be the flexible forced electricity and more electric demand can be covered by the flexible electricity. The capability of the energy flexible building is enhanced in terms of shifting the forced electricity from the renewable shortage period to the renewable surplus period. Above all, the developed hybrid controller is more technically competitive than others, in terms of fully utilising the building energy flexibility. By implementing the developed hybrid controller, 27% surplus renewable electricity can be the flexible forced electricity, and 55% electric demand can be covered by the flexible electricity. Moreover, the capability of the energy flexible building for shifting the forced electricity from the renewable shortage period to the renewable surplus period is 0.12. 4.4 Discussion for real applications and future potential This study demonstrates the robustness and effectiveness of the cross-entropy function under supervised machine learning for building demand predictions. In the real application, the cross-entropy function can be used for the feature extraction and classification from the past energy data, and then to predict the building energy performance. The predicted building energy performance can be implemented in the centralised system controller for the mitigation on grid reliance and the energy flexibility enhancement. The developed surrogate model can significantly reduce the computational load, which can provide more chances to both hardware and software with super-calculation capacity to deal with data analytic problems. Furthermore, the proposed energy flexibility quantification methodology can be used for the system assessment, optimal design and robust operation. 5 Conclusions In this paper, in terms of accurate building energy predictions with considerable computational efficiency, the sophisticated nonlinearity and complexity of building energy systems were simplified by data-driven models using the supervised machine learning technique. The robustness and the resilience of the data-driven models have been comparatively studied, in terms of different neural networks and different learning functions, including the stochastic gradient descent function and the batch function for the single-layer neural network, the sum of the square error function and the cross-entropy function for the multi-layer neural network. To demonstrate the feasibility of the developed data-driven model, five statistical indicators were used to investigate the prediction performance. Afterwards, the developed data-driven model was used for the short-term demand prediction, considering scenario parameters\u2019 uncertainty. Four different controllers have been developed and contrasted for the utilisation of the energy flexibility from the demand side management, including the rule-based controller, the predictive controller, the iterative feedback controller and the hybrid controller. A case study was shown to demonstrate the technical viability of the developed hybrid controller on the energy flexibility enhancement. Remarkable conclusions are drawn as follows: 1) Compared to other learning functions, the surrogate model with the cross-entropy function learns much faster and more accurate in terms of predicting the building energy demand. Furthermore, the developed data-driven model with the advanced learning function can meet the requirement of the ASHRAE Guideline 14 with the normalized mean bias error (NMBE) less than 10% and the coefficient of variation or the root mean-square error (CV-RMSE) less than 30%. 2) By adopting the data-driven model for the short-term demand prediction, the lack of input factors may result in an inaccurate performance of the demand prediction. According to the results in this study, the increase of training times can significantly improve the prediction performance. This is an effective solution for the accurate prediction and is worthy to be widely popularized, in respect to the incomplete considerations of all impact factors in the sophisticated building energy system, especially with various integrated subsystems. 3) By implementing the predictive controller, the peak power of the building energy demand can be reduced from 517.8 to 404.4 kW by 21.9%. Furthermore, the implementation of the developed hybrid controller can reduce the time-duration of the peak power. From the perspective of the grid interactions, when implementing the developed hybrid controller, the peak power of the grid importation can be reduced from 500.3 to 195 kW by 61%. 4) By implementing the surrogate model in the building energy management, the developed hybrid controller is more technically competitive than other controllers in terms of fully utilising the building energy flexibility: 27% surplus renewable electricity can be the flexible forced electricity and 55% electric demand can be covered by the forced electricity at the renewable surplus period. Moreover, the capability of the energy flexible building is 0.12, in terms of shifting the forced electricity from the renewable shortage period to the renewable surplus period. In terms of insufficient data for the demand forecasting, the proposed solution in this study can save the cost of data collection, and ensure the accuracy of demand prediction performance. Besides, the developed controllers in this study are useful for the optimal control, the demand-side management, and the system optimization. Research results for different scenarios of the deterministic and the uncertain parameters are presented to prove the technical viability of the proposed technique. This study formulates a flexible energy management system together with advanced controllers, which are important components for the promotion of energy flexible buildings.

        "dc:description": "The accurate demand prediction with high efficiency and advanced demand-side controller are essential for the enhancement of energy flexibility provided by buildings, whereas the current literature fails to present the mechanism on modelling development and demand-side control. This paper aims to deal with the complexity of building demand prediction with supervised machine learning method, including the multiple linear regression, the support vector regression and the backpropagation neural network. The regularization, adding the sum of the weights to the learning function, is utilized to improve the training speed and to solve the overfitting by eliminating the unnecessary connections with small weights. The configuration of the artificial neural network was presented, and sensitivity analysis has been conducted on the learning performance regarding different training times. Energy flexibilities of sophisticated building energy systems (including renewable system, electric and thermal demands and building services systems) were quantitatively characterised with a series of quantifiable indicators. Moreover, several advanced controllers have been developed and contrasted, in regard to the flexibility utilisation of building energy systems. Results showed that, the developed hybrid controller with short-term prediction through the cross-entropy function is more technically competitive than other controllers. With the implementation of the developed hybrid controller, the peak power of the grid importation can be reduced from 500.3 to 195 kW by 61%. This study formulates a data-driven model with an advanced machine learning algorithm for the accurate building demand prediction and a hybrid advanced controller with short-term prediction for the energy management, which are critical for the promotion of energy flexible buildings.",
