Graphical abstract To take advantage of the data generated in buildings, this document proposes a methodology based on a machine learning model to improve thermal comfort and energy efficiency. This methodology uses measured data (e.g., indoor/outdoor temperature, relative humidity, etc.) and forecast data (e.g., meteorological data) to train a multiple linear regression model to forecast the indoor temperature of the space under study. Using the genetic algorithm optimization method, this model is then used to evaluate the different heating strategies generated. For each strategy, a score is assigned according to user-defined criteria in order to prioritize them and select the best one. By studying an office building simulated under the TRNSYS software, a multiple linear regression model was implemented with errors less than 1% and an adjusted R2 coefficient close to 0.9. Compared to a conventional heating strategy, this methodology can improve thermal comfort by up to 43%.

In addition, on average, people spend about 90% of their time indoors, according to the Environmental Protection Agency [6]. It is therefore essential to be able to provide buildings with acceptable indoor comfort conditions, allowing users to enjoy well-being and optimise their performance, while ensuring efficient building energy use. In this context, several research studies in different fields have investigated various ways to improve indoor comfort and energy efficiency throughout building lifecycle. Regarding the design and the construction phases [8], developed a multi-criteria method for defining the windows of an office building designed for Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, as a compromise between landscape view, daylight level on work surface and energy efficiency. Focusing on innovative materials [18], studied the benefits of integrating phase change materials into building envelopes under the Tunisian climate and studied its effects on thermal insulation. Looking for the best Heating Ventilation and Air-Conditioning system in an energy retrofit operation [22], used Dynamic Thermal Simulation with TRNSYS software to compare the energy performance of three different systems. Other authors have looked for more comprehensive methods [16], set up a novel framework for integrating mathematical optimization, Building Information Modelling, and Life Cycle Assessment to enhance the operating energy efficiency. They concluded that sustainable building decisions can be achieved by optimizing the material selection and assessment of environmental impact [18] have developed an integrated decision-support tool to assess existing office buildings and recommend an optimal set of sustainable renovation measures, considering trade-offs between renovation cost, improved building quality and environmental impacts. Concerning the operating phase, a significant difference is found between predicted (computed during the design phase) energy performance and measured (during operating phase) energy performance of buildings [21]. According to the report of the UCL Energy Institute on gathered data from the CarbonBuzz platform which records the energy consumption of buildings in Europe, in 2013, for office building, the gap between the mean design total energy and the mean actual total energy is 1.59 for heating and 1.71 for electricity [19]. This difference may be due to several factors: i. Predicted performance: oversimplified and/or unrealistic design assumptions (occupancy behaviour, construction quality, management and control, etc.), inaccuracies in predictions, restrictive or oversimplified models (not representative of reality), ii. Real performance: occupancy behaviour (e.g., opening windows), built quality and management control (e.g., inappropriate strategies) [13]. In this context, several authors worked on the optimization of HVAC system control and building data-based modelling [3] proposed a new methodology for modelling the thermal behaviour of residential buildings using the PieceWise AutoRegressive eXogenous (PWARX) model. They concluded that solar radiation and heating power are the main influential inputs for modelling thermal behaviour with an influence index of 20% and 70% respectively. In order to determine the optimal start time of the setback temperature during the normal occupancy period of a building [15], set up a predictive Artificial Neural Network (ANN). With the aim of maintaining the indoor thermal control [10], demonstrated an enhanced predictive control model based on a Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) model applied on an Internet of Things (IoT) smart space, using Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) to express users\u2019 comfort satisfaction. In the same way [4], proposed ThermCont a tool based on a MLR to predict and control occupants' thermal comfort through the PMV model in real time in office building. They used Genetic Algorithm (GA) to optimize parameters values of thermal comfort. On the other hand, IoT is increasingly being democratized and introduced in all fields. In the building sector, the term smart building, or smart city on a larger scale, is increasingly being used with the aim of detecting, tracking, locating and monitoring things (e.g., energy consumption, fault detection, etc.) [14]. The purpose of this study is to develop a novel anticipatory control approach for heating systems based on building-generated data. This approach uses a multiple linear regression model capable of forecasting indoor temperature with high accuracy from inputs such as weather data and heating strategy. This model is then coupled with a genetic algorithm to optimize heating system control, proposing a new strategy that takes into account the trade-off between thermal comfort and energy efficiency. In the context of this study, contrary to the studies presented above which deal with PMV, thermal comfort is represented as a comfort range of indoor temperature (defined by the user and/or according to standards) since the study of PMV requires quite extensive measurements and is often more suitable for experimental buildings. This aspect will be addressed in future works. To achieve this objective, the proposed approach consists of three main levels, as shown in Fig. 1 : i. Data Level: collection and pre-processing of measured data (tin, relative humidity, etc.) and forecasted data (meteorological data), ii. Config Level: definition of user preferences (selection criteria, e.g., comfort range) and iii. Core Platform Level: training of the forecasting model with the collected data, test of the generated heating strategies and finally selection of the best heating strategy according to the selection criteria. This article is organised as follows: in section 2, the development of the novel approach is presented in three parts. A first part describes the development of the indoor temperature forecast model, a second part details the process of testing the heating strategies and a third part explains the selection of the new heating strategy. In section 3, a study case is discussed and finally section 4 is devoted to the conclusion. 2 Methodology In this section, the data used are generated using TRNSYS software simulating a building office located in Nice, France and composed of 8 separately controlled thermal zones as shown in Fig. 2 . Each zone is equipped with a power-controlled heating system. Initially, all systems are controlled as follows: between 8:00 a.m. and 6:00p.m., the heating power is set to 100% and 0% for the rest of the day (Fig. 3 ) and for weekends. One simulation year is considered with one-hour time step, using a Typical Meteorological Year (TMY) weather file. 2.1 Forecasting model On the basis of the simulated building, a data-driven model is built in a 3-step process providing high accuracy Tin forecasts. 2.1.1 Initial models Firstly, the interest is on the selection of the model inputs (predictors). A preselection process is carried out according to the availability of data in real buildings and according to their physical sense. Then the following data are preselected: heating power demand (Pheat), outdoor temperature (Tout), outdoor relative humidity (RHout), global horizontal radiation (Rad), sky opacity (OpaSky), wind speed (WindS) and wind direction (WindDir). Based on a one typical simulation year, three datasets are formed, as showed in Table 1 . A Pearson correlation study is performed on each dataset. The Pearson Correlation estimates the linear correlation between two quantitative variables, in other words it is an estimation of the fit of a variable against another variable by an affine relation obtained by linear regression. The Pearson correlation coefficient (r) was used to assess the linear relationship between two variables (output-input). It can range from −1 to + 1. A positive r indicates a positive linear correlation and a negative r indicates a negative linear correlation. When the value is closer to + 1 or −1, the linear correlation is strong [9]. Generally, it is considered that: \u2022 r ≤ 0.39 represents weak correlations, \u2022 r between 0.40 and 0.69 represents moderate correlations, \u2022 r between 0.70 and 1 represents strong or high correlations, \u2022 r ≥ 0.9 represents very high correlations [9]. Table 2 shows that during the first heating period of the year (dataset 1), the correlation of Tout to Tin is greater than 0,5 and the correlation of Pheat and Rad is close to 0,5 (0,395 and 0,452 respectively), while the other variables have correlations close to 0. Table 3 , which regroups the results of the correlation study on dataset 2 (heating off), shows that only Tout has a high correlation with Tin, with a correlation coefficient of 0,710. All other variables have a correlation coefficient close to 0, except RHout which has a correlation coefficient of −0,184. Table 4 shows a strong correlation between Tout and Tin during the second heating period (dataset 3). Rad and RHout have low but not negligible correlation coefficients of 0.356 and 0.207 respectively. Regarding correlation coefficient on the full year data (Table 5 ), it turns out that the Tout has a high correlation coefficient of 0.701 and Rad has a non-negligible correlation coefficient of 0.226, while the other variables have correlation coefficients less than 2 and close to 0 for some (WindS, WindDir and OpaSky). The results of the correlation studies show that Tout has a strong correlation with Tin throughout the year. Concerning the Rad and the Pheat, their correlations are quite low (between 0,12 and 0,45) and this is explained by the intermittency of their effect since the rad depends on the presence of the sun and the Pheat depends on the occupation of the building. The other variables have very low correlations (less than0.1) except RHout which has a maximum correlation of 0.2 when the correlation of Tout is 0.799, reflecting the high correlation between Tout and RHout. Then it was decided to retain Tout, Rad and Pheat. Now, looking at the correlation between predictors, a high correlation between two variables means that they are collinear. Then they share part of its variance. From a model level, this does not mean that each predictor's effects are cumulative, but rather that the common part plus the specific part of each predictor is cumulative. Subsequently, analysis of model residuals will confirm (or infirm) whether the predictors explain the dependent variable well. This means that the dependent variable is explained by the dependent variables plus a residual part attributed to errors. It is desirable to have a low residual part. Based on the above analysis, a model using Tout, Rad and Pheat as input is set up, as shown in Fig. 4 . Selected data are normalized, and then model parameters are estimated using the Least Mean Square method [5]. Model equation can be written according to the following general formula (Eq. (1)): (1) y ^ i = β 0 + β 1 x i 1 + β 2 x i 2 + ⋯ + β p x ip + ε i With, for i = n observations: \u2022 y: dependent variable \u2022 x i : explanatory variables \u2022 β 0 : constant term \u2022 β p : slope coefficients for each explanatory variable \u2022 ε : model\u2019s error (residuals) To estimate the performance of each model, three statistical metrics are used: \u2022 Adjusted R2 ( R 2 adj ): the R2 determination coefficient gives an idea of the quality of model prediction, by measuring the fit between observed and obtained data. The advantage of the R 2 adj compared to the R2 is the consideration of the number of predictors, \u2022 Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE): average of the absolute deviations from the observed values. It is a percentage and therefore a practical indicator for comparison, \u2022 Root Mean Square Error (RMSE): the square root of the MSE, which is the arithmetic mean of the errors of the squares of the differences between model predictions and observations. To compare models and check its performance the cross-validation method is used. It is a type of validation technique. There are mainly two techniques: i) the original dataset is divided into two parts, the first one is called the training part and the second one is called the test part. The model is built on the training part and its performance is calculated on the test part. Usually the split is: 2/3 training set and 1/3 test set, ii) The test part is left for the final evaluation and the training part is divided into k smaller parts (fold). The model is trained on k-1 part and tested on the remaining part. The operation is repeated k times and k results are obtained. An average is then made to get the performance of the model. This method is called k-fold cross-validation. In this study, the 10-fold cross-validation method is used (k = 10 folds). Results obtained using the developed model on database 1, database 2 and database 3 are presented in Fig. 5 , Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 respectively. The average scores are grouped in Table 6 . Table 6 regroups the average performances obtained by testing the model on the 3 different datasets. Looking closely at the model, all predictors have p-values below 5% which is considered to be the threshold of significance and therefore all predictors are significant [12]. And so, this model is used for the rest of the study. 2.2 Model optimisation The selected model has an R 2 adj , MAPE and RMSE comprised between 0.41 and 0.67, between 4.76 and 7.81 and between 1.37 and 2.31 respectively. These performances are not sufficient for this study. The objective of this section is to improve the model performance by maximizing the R2 and minimizing the MAPE and RMSE. To achieve this goal, the authors opted to enrich each of the initial datasets with historical. The dataset is considered as a statistical population composed of n static individuals. Each individual is composed of one (or more) output (Tin) and predictors (Tout, Rad and Pheat). The addition of history consists in enriching each individual with its previous data. The individual i which contains data measured at the instant t will be enriched by data measured at the instant t-D (at the previous hour if D = 1). To test this approach, in a first step, only the Tin of the last hour has been added. The resulting model (model 2) can be written under the form of Eq (2) and has the performances grouped in Table 7 . (2) Tin ^ i = β 0 + β 1 Tout i + β 2 Rad i + β 3 Pheat i + β 4 Tin i - 1 By adding only the Tin of the last hour the average MAPE over the 3 datasets increases from 6.45 to 0.67. A parametric study was conducted by varying the D of each predictor from 0 to 3, as follows: (3) Tin ^ i = β 0 + β 1 Tout i + β 2 Rad i + β 3 Pheat i + ∑ 1 4 β i Tin i - D + ∑ 1 4 β i Tout i - D + ∑ 1 4 β j Rad i - D + ∑ 1 4 β k Pheat i - D Then, a parametric study was conducted by varying the D of each predictor from 0 to 4 (Eq (3)), in order to find the best delay for each parameter. 32,768 models on each dataset were studied, giving Eq (4), Eq (5) and Eq (6) corresponding to datasets 1, 2 and 3 respectively. (4) Tin ^ i = β 0 + β 1 Tout i + β 2 Pheat i + β 3 Hrad i + β 4 Tin i - 1 + β 5 Tout i - 1 + β 6 Pheat i - 1 + β 7 Tin i - 2 + β 8 Tout i - 2 + β 9 Pheat i - 2 + β 10 Tin i - 3 + β 11 Tout i - 3 + β 12 Pheat i - 3 (5) Tin ^ i = β 0 + β 1 Tout i + β 2 Tin i - 1 + β 3 Tout i - 1 + β 4 Tin i - 2 + β 5 Tout i - 2 + β 6 Tin i - 3 + β 7 Tout i - 3 + β 8 Hrad i - 3 (6) Tin ^ i = β 0 + β 1 Tout i + β 2 Pheat i + β 3 Tin i - 1 + β 4 Tout i - 1 + β 5 Pheat i - 1 + β 6 Tin i - 2 + β 7 Tout i - 2 + β 8 Pheat i - 2 + β 9 Tin i - 3 + β 10 Tout i - 3 + β 6 Pheat i - 3 + β 12 Hrad i - 3 Comparing the equations obtained, unsurprisingly, it turns out that Eq. (4) and Eq. (6) are almost identical. This is because these two models are driven over two heating periods. The Eq. (4) takes the instantaneous value of Rad while the Eq. (6) takes its value with a delay of 2 h. Concerning Eq. (5), the heating power is excluded since it is a period of non-heating. Since the objective of this work is to implement a scalable model that can be used throughout the year, and since the goal is to optimize heating control, the model based on Eq. (5) is eliminated. Looking at the residuals represented in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9 , it can be noticed that: \u2022 After fitting the model on the training data set, the residual errors of the model are independent and identically distributed (random variables), \u2022 Residual errors are normally distributed (Fig. 9), \u2022 Residual errors have constant variance (homoscedastic). Table 8 groups the performance of models 3 and 4 based on Eq. (4) and Eq. (6) respectively. The performances of the two models are approximately identical and have a high precision. Judging that the effect of the sun is not instantaneous, the authors decided to use model 4 for the rest of the study. Fig. 10 shows an example of results obtained by testing model 4 on a part of data from dataset 3. The forecasted Tin (solid line) is very close to the observed Tin (dashed line). Fig. 11 shows a marked linear relationship between the response variable (forecasted Tin) and the observation. To conclude, the analysis of the residuals above, allowed to verify 3 hypotheses necessary for the validation of the model: Normality assumption, Equality of variances assumption and Independence assumption [17]. 2.3 Heating strategies selection In order to improve the thermal comfort and energy consumption of the studied zone, an optimal heating strategy on the basis of predefined criteria (comfort interval, occupancy period, etc.) must be identified. A heating strategy is a control sequence composed of n setpoint values. Each setpoint corresponds to a defined time step depending on the building type (inertia) and the heating system type. For example, for a power-controlled heating system with an hourly step, each setpoint corresponds to one hour. To identify the optimal heating strategy, one of the solutions that can be considered is the brute force optimization method, which consists of testing all possible solutions and thus choosing the best one, as shown in a previous work [1]. However, this approach can become very time-consuming. For example, for a heating system with 2 modes (Mode 1: 100% power and Mode 2: 0%) and with a sequence of 24 h, the number of solutions to be tested is 2 24 and thus more than 16 million solutions and a heating system with 11 modes (10% step) the number of solutions to be tested is 11 24 and thus more than 9 quadrillion solutions. To avoid this kind of problems, two solutions can be considered, the first one is to shorten the command sequence and the second one is to use a more comprehensive optimization method. In this study, the authors decided to opt for the second solution. This choice is justified by the fact that in real buildings, heating systems, especially electrical ones, are often controlled in two modes: 0% and 100%. This type of control is usually called All-or-Nothing and is associated to \u201cif-then\u201d rules. Moreover, it is preferable to avoid limiting the control sequence as this would reduce the capacity of the methodology to anticipate possible anomalies. In this context, the genetic algorithm optimization method has been chosen. Genetic algorithms are a family of computational models inspired by evolution. These algorithms encode a potential solution to a specific problem on a simple chromosome-like data structure and apply recombination operators to these structures in such a way as to preserve critical information [20]. Genetic algorithms are often viewed as function optimizers, although the range of problems to which genetic algorithms have been applied is quite broad. Their purpose is to obtain an approximate solution to a specific optimization problem, when there is no exact method (or the solution is unknown) to solve it within a reasonable time. They attempt to simulate the natural evolutionary process according to the Darwinian model in a given environment. It is about individuals in a population. Each individual is represented by a chromosome composed of genes containing the hereditary characteristics of the individual. The principles of selection, crossing and mutation are inspired by the natural processes [2]. Its general functioning is represented in Fig. 12 . In this work, individuals constituting the population are heating strategies. Then, this population evolves according to three operators: crossover, mutation and selection. The crossover contributes to renew the population by combining two parent solutions to have daughter solutions forming a new population of the same size. The mutation consists in changing (mutating) an element of the population solutions. Selection is a crucial step to keep the best individuals for the fitness function. The performance of the algorithm depends strongly on the stopping criterion (e.g., iteration number) [11]. In this study, the fitness function is composed of the forecasting model and the score calculation function. Each generated heating strategy is tested using the forecasting model getting its corresponding Tin. According to the predefined comfort criteria, a score is assigned to each heating strategy (calculated on both Tin) and energy consumption. 3 Results To test the developed logic, the simulated building is cloned. The heating of the initial building is controlled according to a deterministic scenario as described in Section 2. The heating of the cloned building is controlled according to the adaptive logic described above. The authors have defined the comfort criteria described in Table 9 . These comfort criteria are inspired by the ASHRAE Standard 55 which recommends a minimum operating temperature of 21.5 °C for a low relative humidity and 19.5 °C for a relative humidity of 85% and a maximum operating temperature of 26.5 °C for a low relative humidity and 24 °C for a relative humidity of 65%. The operating temperature is calculated as a function of the air temperature, the average radiant temperature, and the air velocity. However, in real buildings, for practical reasons, heating is often controlled according to the indoor air temperature. For this reason, the authors have decided to choose the comfort criteria regarding the indoor air temperature. These comfort criteria are a minimum temperature of 21 °C and a maximum temperature of 24 °C, during the occupied hours. In addition, a minimum temperature of 16 °C during unoccupied hours is considered, to avoid an excessive drop in indoor temperature during long periods of unoccupied time, such as vacations or weekends. It is obvious that the air temperature is not enough to analyse the thermal comfort in a complete way, nevertheless it allows to have an idea of the thermal comfort and to give an objective to this methodology. In future work, a thermal comfort model will be implemented considering more parameters such as relative humidity, radiant temperature, etc. to analyse thermal comfort in a more complete way. The study focuses on two different time periods: from February 17 to March 3 and from December 6 to December 16. Initially, two databases are built: a database of measured parameters and a database of forecasted parameters (e.g., weather). In this study, the weather forecast data come from the weather file used by the TRNSYS simulation. Data from the two databases are cleaned and pre-processed, by removing outliers, replacing missing values and performing normalization to standardize the effect of all parameters. At the first iteration, the MLR model receives a 24-hour data matrix composed of forecasted weather data, heating strategy of the next 24 h, and historical data corresponding to each parameter. Tin's historical data are taken from the measured data database and are replaced by forecasted data when the measurements are not available, as explained in Fig. 13 . For example, after 3 iterations, to forecast Tin at i + 2 ( T i n i + 2 ) , measured Tin three hours ago ( T i n i - 1 ) , two hours ago ( T i n i ) and one hour ago ( T i n i + 1 ) are used. Since the loop was started at the instant i, T i n i - 1 is available, while T i n i and T i n i + 1 are not. They are therefore replaced by their forecasted values, respectively T i n i ^ and T i n i + 1 ^ . This functioning has the risk of propagating errors, especially prediction errors. To cope with this problem, the heating strategy is recalculated at each time step. Using the forecasting model in the fitness function of the genetic algorithm, several heating strategies are tested. The best strategy is selected according to the predefined criteria, as shown in Fig. 14 . Accordingly, the final score of each strategy is the sum of: a first part calculated on Tin versus comfort criteria and a second part calculated on energy consumption (normalised). The first part is multiplied by a weighting coefficient W to favour strategies satisfying comfort criteria. At the end of the optimization process using the implemented genetic algorithm, the heating strategy with the lowest score is selected. It allows to identify the optimal heating strategy for the next 24 h, taking into account the weather forecast and the future behaviour of the study zone. Fig. 15 and Fig. 18 represent the evolution of Tin before (initial building) and after (clone building) the application of the methodology developed respectively for the period from February 17 to March 3 and for the period from December 6 to December 16. While Fig. 16 and Fig. 19 represent the forecasted Tin as a function of the Tin of the clone building. The graph follows an almost perfect straight line, it reflects the good performance of the model (less than 1% error). Fig. 17 and Fig. 20 represent the evolution of the activation and deactivation of the heating for the same periods, where 1 corresponds to the heating switch on and 0 to its switch off. Two different periods are treated, one at the beginning of the year and one at the end of the year, to show that the proposed logic works throughout the year. In Fig. 15 and Fig. 18, the black curves represent the Tin evolution of the initial building using a deterministic heating scenario: the heating is turned on between 8:00 am and 6:00 pm and turned off outside this time period, as described in section 2. This power-based heating scenario is considered to have a variation in indoor temperature. A heating scenario based on a setpoint temperature would result in an almost constant indoor temperature, since the simulation studied does not consider internal disturbances (e.g., opening of windows) that could affect the indoor temperature. In real buildings, this type of scenario is often associated to an \u201cif-then\u201d loop, so that the heating is turned on (at 100%) while the indoor temperature is below the desired value and is turned off (at 0%) when the indoor temperature is above the desired value. In Fig. 15 and Fig. 18, the blue curves correspond to the Tin of the clone building using the new heating strategies suggested by the logic proposed in this paper. In this case study, the comfort interval ranges from 21 °C to 24 °C during occupied hours and above 16 °C during unoccupied hours. In Fig. 15, the Tin of the initial building (black curve) does not meet these comfort criteria at all. However, by applying the customized heating strategy, the Tin of the clone building fully meets these criteria. This was achieved thanks to the anticipation of the switching on and off of the heating, as shown in Fig. 17. Identically, for the period between December 6 and December 16 (Fig. 18), the new heating strategy allowed the thermal comfort criteria to be met. Heating strategies are chosen to ensure thermal comfort as a priority and to save energy when it is possible. Fig. 21 and Fig. 22 are the zooms on the first day of Fig. 18 and Fig. 20, respectively. It can be noticed that the thermal comfort criteria are respected, and energy savings have been made. Indeed, initially the heating is switched on continuously between 12:00 pm and 6:00 pm while the new heating strategy proposes to switch it off for 3 h. Thus, over this period, an energy savings of nearly 43% was achieved. 4 Conclusion In this paper, we propose a new thermal control methodology based on a machine learning forecasting model and genetic algorithm optimisation method for indoor heating. This methodology is mainly based on two modules: a MLR model to forecast the indoor temperature with an error less than 1% and a second module to define new heating strategies in order to improve the thermal comfort while trying to save energy when possible. The second module uses a genetic algorithm integrating the MLR model to find the best heating strategy according to the fitness function. The MLR forecast model is developed following a statistical approach that we have implemented. By comparing the initial model that uses only raw data to the optimized model that uses raw data and their historical data, the error is reduced from 8% to less than 1%. This approach can be applied to any type of instrumented building. The model developed is self-adjusting and can be used throughout the year. The selection of the best heating strategy is made using a genetic algorithm. Based on the MLR model, the genetic algorithm allows to test several heating strategies. Each strategy consists of n heating setpoints corresponding to n time steps. By performing tests, it was found that setting the n to 24 is a good compromise between computational time and physical sense. Then, according to the predefined comfort criteria, a score is assigned to each heating strategy. In order to better approach thermal comfort, the current comfort criteria based on air indoor temperature will be completed by other physical parameters such as relative humidity, radiant temperature, etc. On the other hand, the felt comfort will be investigated by including the user's feedback. As part of our future works, a real building located in the north of France will be studied. A propagation error analysis will be made during this study. Thereafter, the scoring function will be enhanced with features to encourage energy consumption when it is the least expensive, as well as the integration of parameters that take into account the comfort felt by users.
