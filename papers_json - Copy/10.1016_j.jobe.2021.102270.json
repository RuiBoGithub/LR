Since there are lots of influencing factors in indoor temperature regulation process of air conditioning system in the large-public building, it is difficult to establish an accurate mathematical model and to implement model-based online control. This paper proposes an online modeling method for indoor temperature regulation characteristic according to building thermal process. A physical-data driven model, which takes the state-space equation solution representation form as the reference structure, is proposed, and the model parameters are identified based on the multiple linear regression analysis. Then, experimental and simulation studies in online and offline have been carried out to validate the proposed modeling method. The contribution of this study is to provide an online model, which can not only retain system physical property but also be updated online simply. The proposed model with building thermal process property will be benefit for terminal controller design for indoor temperature regulation in the air conditioning system.

As a result, existing prevalent control methods based on accurate model (such as adaptive PID [2], fuzzy PID [3], PID plus Smith compensation [4]) fails to achieve the expected effect in aspects of energy efficiency and stable operation. Meanwhile, the data-driven black-box model (such as artificial neural network [5] and multivariate regression analysis [6]) depends too much on real-time operating data of controlled object, and it is lack of commonality. Actually, aiming at the modeling problem for HVAC systems, many scholars have already carried out a series of studies [7\u20139], especially for indoor temperature [10\u201312]. Physical-empirical hybrid model, which can not only represent system physical property but also identify model parameters with the operational data, is considered as an effective way. It is commonly believed that the physical model based on the heat balance equation is an effective reference structure for gray-box model because it can retain physical properties of the controlled object. For example, Peng has proposed a zonal model derived from computational fluid dynamics, and the zonal model is transformed into state-space equation representation form in order to design better control systems [13]; Using the discrete state space equation, Huang and Wang proposed an uncertainty polytope to describe time-delay uncertainty [14]; Yao et al. presents a three-zone dynamic model to describe the dynamic behaviors of indoor air temperature and humidity, by transforming the dynamic thermal behaviors model into a state-space equation form [15]; the author's team proposes a simulation model based on the analytical solution of heat balance equation by transforming it into state-space equation [16]. Studies indicate that the model utilizing state-space equation representation form has ability to establish relationship between real-time operating data and physical law. However, it is still worth to further study on combining with the actual operation data and simplifying online computing complexity. In fact, both online-based and co-simulation-based approaches rely on the model to evaluate the control effect, and online control needs simplified (often linearized) models so as to address the real-time requirements of the control problem, especially for closed-loop feedback control process, such as joint energy demand and thermal comfort optimization in the regulation of HVAC systems [17,18] and in-situ real time measurements of thermal comfort [19,20]. For the parameter identification of gray-box model, many optimization techniques such as neural network based on gradient descent [21], nonlinear auto-regression with exogenous neural network [22] and regression analysis are used. Relative to other methods, multiple linear regression (MLR) analysis, which represents the relationship between dependent variable and independent variables accurately [23], has been widely used in the modeling of building energy and environment, such as energy consumption model [24], cooling load model [25], thermal comfort model [26], etc. The author and his partners have carried out researches on the modeling methods based on the conventional hysteresis relay feedback control [27] and two network neural [28]. As stated above, significant achievement has been made, which offers a referable thought. However, limitations still exist for controller design and system commissioning online, and thus the potential key issues for this issue need to be solved as follows. ● Establishment of indoor temperature regulation characteristic model based on physical laws of building thermal process. ● Transform the physical model into the reference structure utilizing state-space equation that is suitable for parameter identification ● Build the physical-data driven model which can be updated online using the operational data Variable air volume (VAV) air conditioning system, which is considered as a kind of complicated air conditioning system, depends on control system highly. It is well known that the dynamic regulation process of VAV system is a typical nonlinear process, which has characteristics of multi-variables, strong coupling, large lag and large inertia. Taking VAV air conditioning system as the study object has great significance for solving online modeling problem of indoor temperature regulation characteristic [29]. Therefore, this paper firstly presents the physical model of indoor temperature regulation characteristic based on the conservation laws of mass and energy, the heat balance equation. Secondly, the proposed physical model is transformed into the state-space equation solution representation form as the reference structure, which is suitable for parameter identification using multiple linear regression analysis. Finally, simulation and experimental studies are implemented in a networked control platform of VAV air conditioning system. This paper is organized as follows: Section 2.1 and 2.2 presents physical model and the state-space equation of indoor temperature regulation characteristic, respectively. In Section 2.3, the state-space equation solution representation form as the reference structure is proposed and corresponding parameter identification method is demonstrated based on multiple linear regression analysis. Subsequently, simulation and experiment results are presented and discussed in Section 3. Finally, Section 4 concludes with a description of results and addresses possible future work. 2 Methods and theory 2.1 Physical model of indoor temperature regulation characteristic The indoor temperature regulation schematic of air conditioning system is shown in Fig. 1 . The common control strategy is to change supply air volume or supply air temperature by regulating the terminal device (such as damper, fan, valve of heat exchanger, etc.), so as to maintain indoor temperature within the range of its setting value. Generally, the dynamic regulation process of variable air volume (VAV) systems is a typical nonlinear process, which has characteristics of multi-variable, strong coupling, and large lag. The indoor temperature lag response characteristic is a very important factor, however, it is difficult to describe the lag characteristic using of the laws of mass and energy conservation. To be benefit for modeling, the dynamical model is firstly built without consideration of indoor temperature lag response characteristic in this paper, and then the corresponding lag response description is added using the following form. (1) y ( t ) = f ( x , t ) + d ( e x , t ) + ∑ i = 1 n β i y ( t − i ) Where, y ( t ) represents the system output of present time; f ( x , t ) represents the expression of system input at present time, in this paper this expression is the equation based on the laws of mass and energy conservation; y ( t − i ) and β i represent the system output of previous time and corresponding coefficient respectively, in this paper this expression is indoor temperature measured value of previous time; d ( e x , t ) represents the system external input of present time, in this paper this expression is the apparent heat generated inside room. Therefore, without consideration of indoor temperature lag response characteristic, the dynamical model of indoor temperature in the air conditioning system is described in Equation (2), which reflects the dynamic response relationship of multiple-inputs-single-output (MISO) between the change of indoor temperature, system regulation variables and instantaneous cooling load. (2) ρ r C P V r d T r ( t ) d t = ρ s u p C P G s u p ( t ) T s u p ( t ) − ρ o u t C P G o u t ( t ) T r ( t ) + Q L ( t ) Where, ρ r represents room air density, 1.29 kg/m3; C P represents specific heat at constant pressure of air, 1.0 kJ/kg⋅°C; V r represents the volume of air-conditioned room, m3; T r represents indoor temperature, °C; ρ s u p and ρ o u t represent the density of supply air and return air respectively, kg/m3; G s u p and G o u t represent the airflow volume of supply air and return air respectively, m3/s; T s u p represents supply air temperature, °C; Q L represents the apparent heat generated inside room, which is generated from outdoor hot air, solar radiation, indoor heat source, building envelope and indoor storage heat thing. To be convenient for derivation, the following assumptions are made: 1) The airflow in the air conditioning system can be considered as the incompressible fluid, and there is no phase transition in the regulation process of indoor temperature. Therefore, air temperature barely impacts on air density, the influence of air temperature on air density can be ignored, that is to say ρ s u p = ρ o u t = ρ r . 2) The common control strategy of VAV systems is to remain supply air temperature unchanged and to control indoor temperature by changing supply air volume. Therefore, supply air temperature T s u p remain unchanged, and only the air supply volume is changed in this study. 3) Considering room positive pressure and the penetration through doors and windows, the air volume flowing out of the room is equal to 0.9\u20130.95 ratio ( γ =0.9\u20130.95) of that flowing into the room. It can be known from Equation (2), the mathematical model under the condition of variable air volume regulation is described as below. (3) ρ r C P V r d T r ( t ) d t = ρ r C P G s u p ( t ) ( T s u p − γ T r ( t ) ) + Q L ( t ) In the dynamic regulation process, the change of supply air volume will cause the change of indoor temperature. It is assumed that indoor temperature at previous time is stable and is equal to its setting value, and then the change of indoor temperature at present time can be considered as the deviation between the measured value of indoor temperature and its setting value. Corresponding change of supply air volume in air conditioning room and the change of sensible heat generated within room can be described below. (4) Δ T r ( t ) = T r ( t ) − T s p (5) Δ Q L ( t ) = Q L ( t ) − Q L ( t s p ) (6) Δ G s u p ( t ) = G s u p ( t ) − G s u p ( t s p ) Where, T s p represents the indoor temperature setting value of air conditioning room; t s p represents the time when indoor temperature is stable. It is noted that the stable-state t s p does not exist in reality. In the purpose of practical application, when indoor temperature reaches acceptable error range (for example ±0.2 °C or ±0.5 °C) within its setting value, it is considered that indoor temperature is in stable state and the begin time of this stable-state is recorded as t s p . Substitute Equation (4) ~ (6) into Equation (3). (7) ρ r C P V r d ( T s p + Δ T r ( t ) ) d t = ρ r C P ( G s u p ( t s p ) + Δ G s u p ( t ) ) [ T s u p − γ ( T s p + Δ T r ( t ) ) ] + Q L ( t s p ) + Δ Q L ( t ) In particular, when indoor temperature fluctuates near its setting value, it can be considered that supply cooling capacity of VAV terminal room is equal to the instantaneous cooling load at this time. Therefore, Equation (3) can be expressed as follows. (8) ρ r C P V r d T s p d t = ρ r C P G s u p ( t s p ) [ T s u p − γ T s p ] + Q L ( t s p ) = 0 In this way, substitute Equation (8) into Equation (7), and it can be obtained as follows. (9) ρ r C P V r d Δ T r ( t ) d t = ρ r C P ( G s u p ( t s p ) + Δ G s u p ( t ) ) [ T s u p − γ ( T s p + Δ T r ( t ) ) ] + Q L ( t s p ) + Δ Q L ( t ) = − ρ r C P G s u p ( t s p ) ⋅ γ Δ T r + ρ r C P Δ G s u p ( t ) ( T s u p − γ T s p ) − ρ r C P γ Δ G s u p ( t ) Δ T r ( t ) + Δ Q L ( t ) 2.2 State-space representation of indoor temperature regulation characteristic Equation (9) gives the differential equation of indoor temperature under the condition of variable air volume regulation based on the conservation laws of energy and mass. However, it is too complicated to directly describe the relationship between the indoor temperature change and regulation variables (the change of supply air volume, the change of supply air temperature) and the change of instantaneous cooling load, and it is not convenient for online application. Therefore, this section will further carry out the study on given a differential equation in order to further develop the model that is suitable for online identification and application. When the system is under the stable operating condition, the change of indoor temperature or supply air volume is very small. As a result, the product between Δ G s u p ( t ) and Δ T r ( t ) is very small, and the term of ρ r C P γ Δ G s u p ( t ) Δ T r ( t ) can be ignored. Thus, Equation (9) can be approximated as follows. (10) ρ r C P V r d Δ T r ( t ) d t = − ρ r C P G s u p ( t s p ) ⋅ γ Δ T r ( t ) + ρ r C P Δ G s u p ( t ) ( T s u p − γ T s p ) + Δ Q L ( t ) Equation (10) can be transformed into the state-space equation representation form. (11) d Δ T r ( t ) d t = − γ G s u p ( t s p ) V r Δ T r ( t ) + ( T s u p − γ T s p ) V r Δ G s u p ( t ) + 1 ρ r C P V r Δ Q L ( t ) Equation (11) is the state-space equation of indoor temperature dynamical response characteristic under the condition of constant supply air temperature and variable supply air volume. Where, − γ G s u p ( t s p ) V r is regarded as system coefficient; Δ T r ( t ) is regarded as status variable; ( T s u p − γ T s p ) V r is regarded as control variable coefficient; Δ G s u p ( t ) is regarded as control variable; 1 ρ r C P V r is regarded as disturbance coefficient; Δ Q L ( t ) is regarded as disturbance variable. It can be seen that the proposed model with the state-space equation representation form can realize indoor temperature prediction. Considering that the state-space equation could be converted into first-order plus time-delay link transfer function, the proposed model may be useful for obtaining controller regulation parameters (such as PID algorithm). 2.3 Model reduction and parameter identification 2.3.1 Model reduction To be convenient for online application, the model will be simplified, and corresponding identification method will be proposed based on MLR [23]. Generally, the variable quantity of supply air volume Δ G s u p ( t ) and the indoor heat gain cooling load Δ Q L ( t ) can be calculated in real time directly. Thus, Equation (11) can be simplified as a first-order linear nonhomogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients. (12) { d Δ T r ( t ) d t + a Δ T r ( t ) = b a = γ G s u p ( t s p ) V r b = ( T s u p − γ T s p ) V r Δ G s u p ( t ) + 1 ρ r C P V r Δ Q L ( t ) It is obvious that a and b are both time variables. But, in a certain control period, Δ G s u p ( t ) and Δ Q L ( t ) can be considered as constant. Thus, the general solution of given differential equation is as follows. (13) Δ T r ( t ) = C e − a t + b a Where, C is an arbitrary constant. It can be noted that indoor temperature at present time is stable and is equal to its setting value when t = 0 , that is to say Δ T r ( t ) = 0 when t = 0 . Substitute this condition into Equation (12), and it can be obtained as follows. (14) C = − b a When indoor temperature is in the stable status, the indoor temperature change of present time is not only related to supply air volume, return air volume and supply air temperature of present time, but also related to indoor temperature of previous time. Combining Equations (13) and (14), the indoor temperature model can be simplified as Equation (15). (15) Δ T r ( t ) = − b a e − a t + b a + ∑ i = 1 n β i T r ( t − i ) a = γ G s u p ( t s p ) V r b = ( T s u p − γ T s p ) V r Δ G s u p ( t ) + 1 ρ r C P V r Δ Q L ( t ) C = − b a Where, Δ T r ( t ) represents the indoor temperature change of air conditioning room; a and b represent the mathematical expression of system regulation variables, which are related to Δ T r ( t ) . Meanwhile, the proposed model brings ∑ i = 1 n β i T r ( t − i ) in to describe the effect of indoor temperature status of previous time versus indoor temperature status of present time. Where, β i represents the effect coefficient of indoor temperature at t − i time against indoor temperature at t time ( i = 1 , \u2026 , n ); n depends on pure lag time of indoor temperature against system regulation variables. Sampling points at previous time \u201c t − 1 , t − 2 , t − 3 , \u2026 , t − n \u201d are determined according to the sample period of discrete control system. It can be seen that the proposed state-space equation solution representation form describes the relationship between change of indoor temperature and system regulation variables, which offers an effective way to prediction future indoor temperature. 2.3.2 Parameter identification based on MLR Equation (15) gives the linear relationship between the change of indoor temperature and system regulation variables directly, and then model coefficients can be calculated by the least-square approximation. To be convenient for online application, the following process need to be done as follows. 1) In the adjacent control period, it can be considered approximately that the sensible heat generated inside room remains unchanged, that is to say Δ Q L = 0 . At the same time, constant coefficient is introduced to compensate the model. 2) In consideration that the time-delay response characteristic of indoor temperature against regulation variables, which means indoor temperature of present time is related to supply air volume and supply air temperature of n -th time, in this paper, the indoor temperature change of present time is just related to indoor temperature of n t h time, and then ∑ i = 1 n β i T r ( t − i ) can be simplified as β n T r ( t − n ) . In this way, taking the mathematical form of multiple regression model as the reference, Equation (14) can be converted into the representation form of Equation (16) directly. Where, a 0 , a 1 , a 2 and a 3 represent regression model coefficients. (16) Δ T r ( t ) = a 0 + a 1 ∗ − b a e − a t + a 2 ∗ b a + a 3 ∗ T r ( t − n ) a = γ ∗ G s u p ( t s p ) V r b = ( T s u p − γ ∗ T s p ) V r Δ G s u p a 3 = β n Considering room positive pressure and the penetration through doors and windows, the air volume flowing out of room is equal to 0.9\u20130.95 ratio of that flowing into room, γ is considered as 0.9 in this study. MLR analysis takes given values of multiple explanatory variables as the condition of regression analysis, and it is a research method on identifying linear relationship between one dependent variable and several independent variables. Therefore, model parameters can be determined by using MLR analysis method. The general form of a MLR model is described in Equation (17). (17) Y = ω 0 + ω 1 X 1 + ω 2 X 2 + \u2026 + ω j X j + \u2026 + ω k X k + μ Where, k represents the number of independent variables; ω j ( j = 1 , 2 , \u2026 , k ) represents regression coefficient; μ represents the random error without considering the effect of the k-th independent variable against Y . Matrix expression of the n-th stochastic equation, which is converted from Equation (17), is given as follows. (18) Y = X ω + μ = [ 1 , X 1 , X 2 , \u2026 X j , \u2026 X K ] [ ω 0 ω 1 ω 2 \u2026 ω j \u2026 ω k ] + μ (19) ω ˆ = ( X \u2019 X ) − 1 X \u2019 Y For the matrix expression of MLR model shown in Equation (18), the least square method can be used for parameter estimation, and the result is shown as Equation (19). After parameters of MLR model are estimated (model coefficients have been solved according to the sampling data), the fitting degree (between sampling regression values and sampling observation values) need be observed by statistics in order to judge the accuracy of identified model parameters. 3 Implementation of simulation and experiment 3.1 Experimental system description The experimental work is completed in a networked control platform for VAV air conditioning system located in Dalian University of Technology. The experimental platform is single floor building as shown in Fig. 2 , including three rooms with the area of 120 m2 and the height of 4 m. Main parameters of three rooms are listed in Table 1 . The materials of exterior and interior walls of Room 2 are plaster and brick. The interior wall materials the between Room 1 and 3 are two-layer color steel plates with polystyrene foam. The AHU are installed in the equipment room, the rated supply air volume and the cooling capacity are 5000 m3/h and 30 kW, respectively. The exhaust fan is installed to balance the room pressure. A damper is installed on each duct branch to control terminal supply air volume. Supply air volume is measured according to the calibrated result of airflow rate sensor. This networked control platform is equipped with advanced automatic control system, which includes a Siemens S7-1200 programmable logic controller (PLC), a self-developed process server software, sensors and actuators. The self-developed process server software, which is achieved based on Python language in Pycharm IDE (integrated development environment), could communicate with PLC based on Modbus-TCP protocol. The self-developed control system provides the advantage for online application with good communication performance. 3.2 Training parameter determination 3.2.1 Acquisition and description of training data According to Equation (16), system real-time operating data including supply air temperature T s u p , indoor temperature setting value T s p , the variation quantity of supply air volume Δ G s u p , the variation quantity of indoor temperature Δ T r between present time and previous time, supply air volume when indoor temperature reaches its setting value at close time G s u p ( t s p ) and indoor temperature of t-n time T r ( t − n ) , need to obtained to calculate MLR model coefficients ( a 0 , a 1 , a 2 a 3 ). It is noted that n depends on pure lag time of indoor temperature against system regulation variables, which can be calculate by the step-response test and hysteresis relay feedback control. Where, supply air volume G s u p , supply air temperature T s u p , indoor temperature of present time T r and indoor temperature setting value T s p could be directly acquired from PLC, others need to be indirectly calculated in the process server software with self-developed. Detailed data acquirement and interaction process are described as below. 1) Process server reads and stores G s u p , T s u p and T r in real time based on Modbus-TCP protocol. 2) Calculate G s u p ( t s p ) , Δ G s u p and Δ T r according to the real-time acquisition and storage data. 3) Take the acquired and calculated data into the input-output array for MLR model coefficient identification. 4) Calculate MLR model coefficients using the least-square parameter estimation method. In this section, the actual operating data is used to validate the effect of the proposed MLR model based on the state-space equation solution. The data sets, which include the profiles of supply air temperature, supply air volume and indoor temperature, are derived from terminal control process of 3# Room in winter. Considering that the execution time of terminal damper from 0 to 100% is 60 s in actual control process, the sampling time interval is selected as 1 min and it can satisfy indoor temperature control requirement. Corresponding 445 sets training data are shown in Fig. 3 . 3.2.2 Selection of training data length In the identification process of MLR model coefficients, the data length of single training is an issue for accuracy of MLR model. If the training data length is too small or too large, the model accuracy may not be guaranteed. Therefore, it is necessary to optimize the data length of single training for the model accuracy. To obtain the appropriate training data length, a criterion needs to be determined. In this study, R-Square is selected to achieve acceptable model accuracy by using appropriate training data length. R-Square is a determination coefficient, which determines the fitness of the model. If the model is worse than this constant model, then the R-Square is negative. It is desirable that R-Square is close to 1. Generally, if R-Squared is between 0.8 and 1, it indicates that the independent variable and the dependent variable have stronger linear correlation [30]. The equation of R-Square is described as follow. (20) R 2 = 1 − ∑ j = 1 n ( y j ∗ − y j ) ∑ j = 1 n y j 2 The selection process for appropriate training data length is repeated by adding the length of the training data set and judging corresponding R-Square incrementally. The first trial uses 1 min input-output training data; the second trial uses 2 min input-output training data; the n t h trial uses training data of n minutes. For the first trial, by applying 445-min actual operating data one-by-one, a total number of 445 sets input-output data are obtained, one set for data of each minute is collected at 1-min interval. For the second trial, training data of two consecutive minutes are applied to training appropriate training data length for each set, and a total of 444 [445 (total number of samples)-2 (data length in a single training) + 1] sets input-output data are obtained. The process continued by adding 1 min to increase the training data length per trial, and 30 sets trial in all are implemented with the training data length from 1 to 30. Because it's difficult to ensure that R-Square must be between 0.8 and 1 in each training process, the number of R-Square between 0.8 and 1 under different training data length is used to evaluate the performance of MLR model instead of R-Square. The number of R-Square above 0.8 under different training data lengths and R-Square under training data length of 4 are shown in Figs. 4 and 5 , respectively. Fig. 4 records the number of R-Square between 0.8 and 1 under different training data length. It can be seen that when the training data length is equal to 3, corresponding number of R-Square above 0.8 is larger than that under other training data length. Meanwhile, Fig. 5 shows the curve of R-Square under the training data length of 3. It can be seen that the number of R-Square above 0.8 is 300, which accounts for 72% (300/420 = 72%) of total training times. Results indicate that the number of R-Square above 0.8 can be considered as an evaluation index to determine appropriate training data length. In this study, the optimal training data length is 3. 3.3 Implementation of proposed identification method The optimal training data length has been determined in previous section. However, it also shows that it is difficult to ensure that R-Square is always above 0.8 in every training. To be convenient for online application, a recursive selection algorithm for MLR model coefficient identification is proposed, and corresponding implementation flow chart is demonstrated in Fig. 6 . Detailed implementation process is below. Step 1 According to Equation (16), G s u p ( t s p ) should be captured when indoor temperature reaches its set-point firstly. Step 2 Save a certain amount of data to calculate optimal training data length, and the calculation process has been demonstrated in Section 3.2.2. In this study, the data of half an hour is enough. Step 3 Acquire the training input-output data in real-time according the result of optimal training data length, and then calculate the model coefficient and corresponding R-Square. Step 4 See whether the R-Square satisfies the requirement. If R-Square is above 0.8, record and save the model coefficient for model identification. Step 5 If R-Square is under 0.8, do not save the model coefficient and return Step 3. 3.4 Result and analysis 3.4.1 Off-line result and analysis In this section, a progressive training mode is adopted based on simulation sampling dataset, and the corresponding relationship between inputs and outputs is shown in Fig. 7 . In a single training, 3 sets of previous system inputs are considered as the model input together, and system output of present time is considered as model output. The training data length is 4 (3 + 1) in a single training. This progressive mode is suitable for online application. The simulation identification result using the actual operating data is shown in Fig. 8 , which shows that the model output value matches the actual value well under the condition that the optimal training data length is 3. In the initial operation process of the system, indoor temperature does not reach its set-point, so G s u p ( t s p ) cannot be obtained in this process. Thus, consideration of the actual operation condition, 1\u201345 sets of training data are used for preliminary training to calculate the initial values of operation parameters, such as G s u p ( t s p ) , Δ G s u p and Δ T r . Then, the 46\u2013445 sets of training data are used as the effective simulation identification results. Corresponding absolute error distribution is shown in Fig. 9 . Fig. 9 shows the histogram of absolute error distribution. The absolute error distribution is mainly within the range of [-0.4, 0.3], and it indicates that the proposed model is effective on capturing indoor temperature dynamics regulation characteristic. 3.4.2 On-line result and analysis In this section, the real-time result of 1#, 2# and 3# Room including the operating process of continuous 4 h in winter, is used to validate the online identification effect of the proposed method. During experimental process, indoor temperature control loop adopts conventional PI algorithm, which regulates the damper to keep indoor temperature within the range of its setting value. The terminals in the same room are controlled in the same way, and supply air volume in Fig. 10 is the sum of all terminals in single room. Meanwhile, supply air fan control loop adopts conventional constant static pressure method, which regulates supply fan to keep supply air pressure within the range of its setting value. Detailed experimental condition parameters are described in Table 2 . Considering that the execution time of terminal damper from 0 to 100% is 60 s in the actual control process, the sampling time interval is 1 min and it can satisfy indoor temperature control requirement. Online training also adopts a progressive training mode, which is shown in Fig. 7. Fig. 10 (a), (b) and (c) show the online identification results, respectively. It indicates that the model output value matches the actual value well in three rooms. The maximum absolute error and mean error in three rooms are (0.8, 0.2), (0.3, 0.1) and (0.3, 0.1), respectively. The online identification results also indicate that the proposed model is effective on capturing the indoor temperature dynamics regulation characteristics. It can be noted that prediction temperature in Room 1 shows lots of fluctuation. The reason may be that Room 1 is the test hall, therefore, the doors are opened frequently, which leads to the fluctuation of supply air volume. 4 Summary and conclusion This paper proposes an online modeling method for building thermal process of indoor temperature regulation characteristic. A physical-data driven model, which takes the state-space equation solution representation form as the reference structure, is proposed, and the model parameter is identified based on multiple linear regression analysis. Then, experiment and simulation studies in online and offline have been carried out to validate the proposed modeling method. Based on results above, there are some conclusions below. 1) The proposed model can retain the physical property and be updated online using the operational data, which will be benefit for terminal controller design of air conditioning systems. 2) The proposed the state-space equation solution representation form describes the relationship between change of indoor temperature and system regulation variables, 3) R-Square could be considered as an evaluation index to determine the appropriate data length. 4) The recursive selection algorithm based on R-Square is an effective method to on-line identify MLR model coefficient. 5) It is noted that if the measurements of supply air volume and supply air temperature are not available, the proposed online model could not be applied online. The proposed online model has the state-space representation form which can be converted into the transfer function, and it may be useful for controller parameter extraction online. Meanwhile, the lag response characteristic is also considered in the modeling process, and the proposed online model can be used to realize indoor temperature prediction and to improve control stability.
