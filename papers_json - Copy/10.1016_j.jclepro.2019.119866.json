Center for Green Buildings and Cities Harvard University Cambridge MA 02138 United States Handling Editor: Weidong Li Advanced control strategies are central components of smart buildings. For model-based control algorithms, the quality of the model that represents building systems and dynamics is essential to guarantee satisfactory performance of smart building control and automation. For the model predictive control of the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems in buildings coupled with natural ventilation, a high-fidelity model is necessary to reliably predict the thermal responses of the building under various environmental and operational conditions. This task can be accomplished by using a deep neural network, which can capture the dynamics of complicated physical processes, such as natural ventilation. Training a deep neural network requires the collection of a large amount of data; however, in practice, the target building may not have enough operational data available. This study demonstrates how transfer learning could help with this dilemma. By freezing most layers of a deep neural network model with 42,902 parameters that are pre-trained on multi-year data from a source room in Beijing, the model can be re-trained with only 200 trainable parameters on only 15 days of data from the target room in Shanghai that has entirely different floor area, building material, and window size. The proposed transfer learning model achieves high accuracy predicting both indoor air temperature and relative humidity for a time horizon from 10 minutes to 2 hours, showing the mean squared error almost one magnitude smaller than the comparison model that is only trained on source data or target data. This methodology can be applied to the design of the control system in a new building which reduces the required amount of data for the training of the model, thus saving costs in control system design and commissioning. Keywords Deep neural network Transfer learning Model predictive control Natural ventilation HVAC 1 Introduction Smart buildings and building automation are key components for achieving greater energy efficiency (King and Perry, 2017). Specifically, the control and coordination of a building\u2019s heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system, along with natural ventilation (Chen et al., 2017), play a significant role in reducing energy consumption and improving thermal comfort (Cao et al., 2019; Luo et al., 2014; Spindler and Norford, 2009; Wu et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2017; Tong et al., 2016; Tong et al., 2019). Model predictive control and reinforcement learning control are two advanced control strategies capable of accommodating the stochastic and complicated natural ventilation processes (Chen et al., 2018; Li and Malkawi, 2016). In order to implement model predictive control or to speed up the training of reinforcement learning control, a model is required to accurately predict building thermal responses under various environmental and operational conditions (Chen et al., 2019). The model can be a physics-based hierarchical white-box building model, such as those created by EnergyPlus (Crawley et al., 2001) and Modelica (Wetter et al., 2014), or a gray-box model such as a resistor-capacitor model (Jara et al., 2016). It can also be a purely data-driven black-box model, employing various choices of machine learning approaches (Li and Wen, 2014). Among them, neural network models demonstrate the greatest potential for the prediction of building thermal responses (Afram et al., 2017). Neural networks have been widely used for various research goals in the field of building science (Kumar et al., 2013), such as HVAC fault detection (Du et al., 2009), photovoltaic power forecasting (Wang et al., 2019), the gauging of building airtightness (Krstić et al., 2014), and heating energy prediction (Jovanović et al., 2015). However, neural network is not the silver bullet for every problem; the applicability should be scrutinized before jumping into modeling and training. If the physical process can be clearly modeled using simple equations, then it will be more pragmatic to use these equations instead of a neural network, as the latter does not reveal the causal relationship and lacks proper interpretability. In buildings with natural ventilation, the reliable prediction of building thermal dynamics is fundamental to the control of building systems and/or quantifying building energy demand. However, natural ventilation is a complicated and chaotic process, and modeling natural ventilation has been a technical challenge. Many factors affect the natural ventilation process, including the floor plan (Tantasavasdi et al., 2001), location of the window, window size (Tong et al., 2016b), window opening direction, indoor-outdoor temperature difference (Allocca et al., 2003), real-time wind pressure (Tong et al., 2016a), etc. Even a sophisticated computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model may not be able to capture the effects of natural ventilation confidently, confined by the limitations of mesh size and structure (especially for the fine details of building components), heat sources, and the morphology of surrounding buildings and other obstructions to air movement. Those challenges make neural network models very promising for the modeling of natural ventilation, since neural network models have sufficient capacity to capture the process yet have relatively affordable computational cost compared to CFD models. Another advantage of using neural networks for building thermal dynamics with natural ventilation is their accuracy. The traditional methods for the modeling of building thermal dynamics usually involve 3D geometry, building material and construction, and internal schedules and activities. Such a physics-based model is ideal for design improvement, since it clearly illustrates causal relationships. However, it may impose difficulty for model predictive building control, since building simulation results rarely, if ever, match the real operational data (Samuelson et al., 2012). This is due to the need for many assumptions to be made during the creation of the model, and in the calibration process, the adjustment for certain variables is largely arbitrary and relies on the model builder\u2019s judgment (Samuelson et al., 2016; Wasilowski and Reinhart, 2009). In addition, unlike the design process in which the causal relationship and interpretability are important, the prediction accuracy is more relevant to model predictive control of building system. To serve that purpose, a model can afford to have less interpretability in exchange of greater accuracy and an easier training process. Besides the above-mentioned suitability of using neural networks for predictive control of buildings with natural ventilation, another unmatchable advantage of neural networks is transferability. For any physics-based model, a finely tuned working model only works for the specific building/room in question, which means the model can hardly be reused or recycled for the simulation of another building/room with different geometry or characteristics. This hurdle has two-fold implications: the first shortcoming is the extra human labor for repeated and tedious work (Samuelson et al., 2012); the second issue, more subtle and profound, is about its real-world applicability. For a new building in which smart-control and automation would be implemented, the simulation results from the physics-based model will inevitably have a discrepancy with real building operation, while there is only a limited amount of data for model calibration or for training a new data-driven model. In such cases, transfer learning could be the key to solving the problem. The idea of transfer learning (Pan and Yang, 2010) is thriving in the field of deep convolutional neural networks for image recognition. In this application, the neural network can be both deep and wide, with hundreds of layers and millions of parameters. Consequently, the training of the model incurs high computational costs. However, if there is already a pre-trained model to classify dogs and cats, for example, can it somehow be reused for the classification of cars and pedestrians (Oquab et al., 2014)? Previous studies (Shin et al., 2016) have proven that it is possible. Since deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) extract features of the image in a hierarchical order (e.g. edges, corners, shapes, body components, etc.), the first few layers can be reused since they serve the same purpose of identifying lower-level features regardless of a dog/cat problem or a car/pedestrian problem. Training the last few layers could be sufficient to repurpose a model to a different classification task. With fewer layers to train, the training process could be much faster, and the required amount of training data could be significantly reduced. This project discusses how transfer learning can help with model creation in the context of smart-building control of HVAC and natural ventilation. This method can serve the purpose of making adequately accurate predictions on a new target building with very limited operational data. A deep neural network model that is pre-trained on data collected from an entirely different building located in another climate zone can be used for transfer learning. This methodology can deliver satisfactory prediction accuracy on natural ventilation without CFD simulation, and can be applied to the model predictive control of other buildings without the need to rebuild the model from scratch as in physics-based simulation. 2 Methodology 2.1 Data description Since neural networks are purely data-driven models, the quality of data will largely determine the quality of the model. The data collected for model training should have significant size, diversity, and coverage. A larger size will help with overfitting issues, diversity will help reduce underlying model bias, and wider coverage will increase the applicability of the model in test scenarios. If the training data fails one of these requirements, the prediction of testing data may become absurd. For model predictive control, it is imperative that the training data cover a wide range of possible numerical domains. Otherwise, the purely data-driven model may not be capable of providing reasonable predictions when the variable domain of the real-world data has not been seen by the model. This is a common caveat for most data-driven models. In addition, the operations of space heating, cooling, and natural ventilation for the model training need to have some randomness, rather than following a fixed schedule. In the latter case, the model will not be able to discern the real effects of a system operation from the scheduling (either time or threshold). It will thus fail to make a reasonable prediction when the operation does not follow the schedule. The source data are collected from the simulation using EnergyPlus of a room with the specifications shown in Table 1 . The room is located in Beijing, which is categorized in the cold climate zone. The monthly outdoor air temperature and relative humidity are shown in Fig. 1 . The room has the dimensions of 3 m × 5 m × 3.5 m in width, length, and height. The south-facing glazing has an area of 4 m2, of which 30% can be fully opened for natural ventilation. The thermal transmittance of the wall is 0.354 W/m2·K; the thermal transmittance of the glazing is 5.788 W/m2·K, and the solar heat gain coefficient (SHGC) is 0.819. The air supply from the HVAC system has an equivalent flow rate of 2 ACH. The volume of natural ventilation is calculated by AirFlowNetwork based on environmental factors such as indoor/outdoor air temperature, wind speed, and wind direction at the moment of that time step (Gu, 2007). The operation of HVAC and natural ventilation are conditionally random: (1) heating, cooling, and natural ventilation are mutually exclusive (no concurrent operation); (2) at each time step at 10-min intervals, the chances of sending a command to trigger space heating, cooling, and natural ventilation are 30%, 30%, and 40%, respectively; (3) the heating operation can only be triggered when the indoor air temperature T in ≤ 25 °C , and the cooling operation can only be triggered when the indoor air temperature T in ≥ 20 °C ; natural ventilation can only be triggered when the outdoor air temperature 13 °C ≤ T out ≤ 29 °C . The target subject is a room located in Shanghai, which is in the climate zone of hot summers and cold winters. The monthly outdoor air temperature and relative humidity are shown in Fig. 1. The room has the dimensions of 5 m × 8 m × 3.5 m in width, length, and height, respectively. The thermal transmittance of the wall is 0.704 W/m2·K; the south-facing glazing has an area of 8.2 m2, of which 10% can be fully opened for natural ventilation. The thermal transmittance of the glazing is 2.761 W/m2·K, and the solar heat gain coefficient is 0.154. As shown in Table 1, the target room is larger than the source room and has less wall insulation but better glazing material. The target room also has a bigger south-facing window but a smaller operable area for natural ventilation. Abundant data have been collected from the source room for an extended period, while there is only a limited number of data available from the target room. The input variables are day of the week, hour of the day, outside air temperature, outside dew point temperature, inside air temperature at current time step, inside relative humidity at current time step, space heating status as a Boolean number, space cooling status as a Boolean number, and natural ventilation status as a Boolean number. The output variables are predicted indoor air temperature and relative humidity at future time steps. 2.2 Neural network models The neural network model created for this task for the prediction of building thermal dynamics is a multilayer perceptron model (MLP). The reason for this choice over a recurrent neural network (RNN), including a long short-term memory model (LSTM), is that the thermal response of air is fairly prompt, especially in this experiment with no extra thermal mass. The HVAC and NV are operated on a randomized basis, so the autocorrelation of indoor air temperature and relative humidity over a few time steps away can be ignored. However, the choice of a neural network model should be taken case by case. For example, if the goal is to predict energy demand or the building that is composed of a significant amount of thermal mass, then models that have the capacity for a longer memory may be more suitable for that specific task. The implementation of this neural network is conducted using Keras (Chollet, 2015), with TensorFlow (Abadi et al., 2016) as the backend. The activation function for each layer is the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLu). For data preparation, outside air temperature, outside dew point temperature, inside air temperature, and inside relative humidity are standardized to the range with the mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. The rest of the variables, including day, hour, space heating, space cooling, and NV, remain as categorical variables. The error reported on predicted indoor air temperature and relative humidity are transformed back to the original units (degree Celsius and percentage, respectively). The design of the MLP model structure has multi-faceted considerations. On the one hand, a model should have sufficient width and depth to capture the complex physical process; on the other hand, a model should be as simple as possible to avoid overfitting and unnecessary computational costs. The size of the training data could imply the proper upper limits of the total trainable parameters in a neural network model. In order to select the best neural network architecture, thirty fully connected MLP models with various architectures have been tested. Table 2 summarizes the explored MLP models and training mean squared error (MSE) on one-time-step ahead indoor air temperature and relative humidity. Each model is trained for one hundred epochs. Due to the stochasticity involved in the model training process, the MSE does not necessarily demonstrate the relative superiority of each model; however, the general trend of the total number of parameters versus MSE indeed provides some insights to the choice of the proper model size. Fig. 2 illustrates the general relationship between the total number of model parameters versus model MSE on training data. With a fixed training period, the MSE of indoor air temperature shows a quasilinear relationship with the natural log of the total number of model parameters. The trend is less clear for the prediction of relative humidity after the total number of parameters passes e 11 (≈60,000). Considering the sample size of training data is 420,000, to balance the model capacity, computational cost, and risk of overfitting, the model that was chosen for further study is the fully connected MLP with 6 hidden layers of size [20,100,100,100,100,100]. The number of total parameters of this neural network is 42,902, which is approximately 1/10 of the training sample size. The structure of the neural network model for this experiment is illustrated in Fig. 3 . The chosen model was subsequently trained for another 500 epochs until convergence using Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2014) as the optimizer with a decaying learning rate. The final MSE on training data after convergence is 0.09 for indoor air temperature and 1.04 for relative humidity. After the first step of pre-train the model on the source data, there are a few options for the prediction of the target room, as illustrated in Fig. 4 . In Option (a), the model keeps its pre-trained weights intact; in Option (b), the model is re-trained on 1,700 samples from the target room. Options (c) and (d) are two possible ways to do transfer learning. Specifically, the base is the trained model which is the same as Option (a). In Option (c) the weights of all layers, except for the last layer, are frozen or, in other words, no longer trainable; in Option (d) the weights of all layers, except for the first layer, are frozen. Therefore, Option (c) has only 202 trainable parameters, and Option (d) has only 200 trainable parameters. By comparison, Option (a) and Option (b) have all 42,902 parameters trainable. The optimizer is Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2014), which takes advantage of the momentum to achieve faster convergence. The loss function uses the mean squared error. 3 Results 3.1 Prediction accuracy: one-time-step ahead prediction The test data is collected from the target room in Shanghai starting May 1st to Dec 31st, which has no overlap with the 1,700 training samples in April. The target room is operated randomly by the same rules as applied to the training data. The testing accuracy is gauged on a one-time-step ahead prediction, which is to use current environmental information to predict indoor air temperature and relative humidity in 10-min later. The MSE of predicted indoor air temperature and indoor relative humidity are shown in Table 3 . Option (a) (the model trained on source data from the smaller room in Beijing) demonstrates the highest MSE for both temperature and humidity of 1.30 and 9.28, respectively, as shown in Table 3. As shown in Fig. 5 , this model tends to over predict the indoor air temperature around the higher-temperature range, and under predict it around the lower-temperature range. This phenomenon may be due to the wider diurnal temperature swing in Beijing, and the faster thermal response of indoor air temperature in a smaller room with the window of high thermal transmittance and SHGC. As the consequence, using the model that was trained on source data from Beijing will result in a wider variance in prediction. Option (b) (the model trained on limited samples from the target room in Shanghai) shows intermediate MSE. However, Fig. 5 clearly illustrates the non-normal distribution of the error, that indoor air temperature is systematically under-predicted near the higher-temperature range. This phenomenon stems from the limitation of the training data, which was only collected in April. Since the data-driven model usually has difficulty performing well in the numerical domain that is out of the range of the training data, the prediction of indoor air temperature in the hotter days is consistently lower than expected. Option (c) (the transfer learning model that trained the weights of the last layer by the limited data from the target room and maintained the weights of other layers untouched) demonstrates the MSE in predictions of indoor air temperature of 0.26 and MSE in relative humidity of 2.90. These metrics are better than those of Option (a) and Option (b). However, the distribution of error still shows some abnormality. Finally, Option (d) (the transfer learning model that trained the weights of the first layer by the limited data from the target room and maintained the other layers frozen) demonstrates the lowest MSE among all models, as shown in Table 3. The MSE of predicted indoor air temperature is as low as 0.16, and MSE of indoor relative humidity is 2.52. Moreover, errors are normally distributed with no systematic bias (see Fig. 6). The results suggest some fundamental differences between transfer learning for image recognition and transfer learning for building thermal dynamics. In the former case, the layers in front should be kept frozen and only the last few layers should be turned trainable on the target data, since the front layers correspond to the lower hierarchical features such as edges or shapes, and their weights should be reused regardless of whether the subject is about animals or fruits. However, for building thermal dynamics, the first layer/layers should be turned trainable while the rest are kept frozen as pre-trained on the source data. This may be due to the underlying physics that two distinct rooms/buildings in two climates have fundamental differences in lower hierarchical characteristics, such as thermal transmittance of building material and room geometry/dimension. However, the higher hierarchical features such as thermal dynamics laws remain the same. If considering that the deeper layers in a neural network map to more abstract relationships and logics, then the last layers should not be retrained since they might correspond to the deeper relationships that resemble physics laws. On the other hand, the first few layers in the front might serve a similar function as parameters for variables in a physics equation and thus should be retrained for each new studied case. 3.2 Predicting accuracy: recursive prediction on the longer time horizon To improve energy efficiency and thermal performance, the 10-min ahead prediction may not be sufficient. A longer horizon of the prediction may be required for the planning of future operations. Under such an assumption, in the following case study, the test data is one week\u2019s consecutive measurements from the target room in Shanghai from May 11th to May 17th, which has no overlap with the 1,700 training samples. In this section, the model for transfer learning is Option (d) that only retrained weights of the first layer. The prediction on a longer time horizon is achieved by recursion, which means the predicted value of indoor temperature and relative humidity are used as inputs for further predictions. The error distributions of 10-min, 30-min, 60-min, and 90-min ahead predictions on indoor air temperature are shown in Fig. 7 . From a shorter time horizon to a longer time horizon, the error range moderately increases, and the distribution becomes more normal. This trend is especially salient for the train-on-source model shown in blue. At the 10-min ahead prediction, the error distribution is clearly bimodal; while the time horizon stretches to 30 min, 60 min, and eventually 90 min, the errors gradually merge to a unimodal distribution. For all four cases, both the train-on-source model and the train-on-target model tend to underpredict the indoor temperature more often than over predict it, while the error by the transfer learning model is always distributed normally with the mean around zero. Additional detailed plots for seven days are shown in Fig. 8 for 10-min, 30-min, 60-min, and 90-min ahead predictions of indoor air temperature. The diagrams show the recursive prediction for prolonged time steps, where the gray squares represent measured data, green squares represent predicted value, and green squares with red outlines represent predicted values that are recorded at the reporting windows of 10 min, 30 min, 60 min, and 90 min. In the first plot of 10-min ahead prediction, the error pattern by the train-on-source model clearly illustrates that this model tends to underpredict indoor air temperature during the night. This may stem from the difference between the two rooms\u2019 thermal characteristics and the difference between the climate features of Beijing and Shanghai. In the second plot of 30-min ahead prediction and the third plot of 60-min ahead prediction, the error pattern by the train-on-target model clearly illustrates that this model tends to underpredict peak indoor air temperature during the day, especially on day three and day five. This may be due to the fact that training data for this model is from April, when no such warm temperature has been observed. In the fourth plot of 90-min ahead prediction, cumulative errors are evident on day six, whereas the 10-min ahead prediction on the same day has a high agreement with true data. As shown in Fig. 9 , the general trend is that the error increases as predicted into the further future. However, errors gradually plateau and do not explode. The shaded areas in Fig. 9 illustrate the range of two standard deviations. For both the transfer learning model and the train-on-target model, the variance increases when predicting the longer time horizon; the train-on-source model has a wide variance to start with, and it does not increase as noticeably as the other models. The variances of all three models start to show signs of the plateau for predicting time steps longer than 1 h. Both the error and the variance of error do not explode due to accumulating with more recursive predicting steps and start to level out on longer time horizons. It might be bounded by the other environmental variables such as outside air temperature and dew point, which prevent predictions from going wildly awry. It may also due to the effect of errors canceling each other on a recursive prediction if it has a normal distribution. 4 Discussion and conclusion Predicting the thermal response of a building is an essential part of predictive control. This task is especially challenging when natural ventilation is involved, due to its complexity and stochasticity. Without knowing the exact thermal effects of opening a window, the control system will not be able to plan the optimal control sequence for the building. The deep neural network, which has been applied in a wide range of scientific research topics, demonstrates a good predictive capacity for this tricky task. However, a deep neural network model usually requires a larger amount of data to sufficiently train the model and avoid overfitting. Unfortunately, in real-world cases, not every building has abundant operational data available for model training. Facing such a dilemma, transfer learning with deep neural networks offers a solution to utilizing deep neural networks with a very limited amount of data. This study explores the relationship between the size of deep neural networks and their predictive capability, revealing that for the purpose of predicting the thermal response of buildings with natural ventilation, a deep neural network with more parameters performs better than a small neural network with a few layers and nodes. The structural complexity may be necessary to unravel the process of natural ventilation. This study demonstrates the superior performance of transfer learning. In our example, the source data came from a small room in Beijing, and the target is a large room in Shanghai. These two rooms have entirely different building materials, window areas, and dimensions. A seven-layer deep neural network with 42,902 total trainable parameters was pre-trained on multi-year source data from the small room in Beijing. For the transfer learning, most weights of this pre-trained model were frozen while only the first layer with 200 parameters remained trainable. This model was then retrained with 15 days of data collected from the target room in April. For one-time-step ahead prediction starting in May in the target room, the transfer learning model achieved the lowest mean squared error on both predicted indoor air temperature and relative humidity. Specifically, the MSE of indoor air temperature by the transfer learning model was 0.16, while the MSE of indoor air temperature by the train-on-source model and the train-on-target model were 1.30 and 0.99, respectively. The MSE of indoor relative humidity by the transfer learning model was 2.52, while that by the train-on-source model and the train-on-target model were 9.28 and 3.47, respectively. For the recursive prediction on a longer time horizon, the transfer learning model also displayed better performance. For the prediction of indoor air temperature on the 10-min to 2-h time horizon in the future, the MSE by transfer learning model never exceeded 0.8, while both the train-on-source model and the train-on-target model had comparable MSEs approaching 3.0. Unlike a traditional physics-based model in which comprehensive and case-specific information, such as building geometry and material, should be provided to create the model, a data-driven model only needs operational data, including environmental conditions, building operations, and building thermal response, for model training. It implies that the model structure can remain invariant for different buildings. Equipped with the transfer learning demonstrated in this study, a potent deep neural network model with a large number of parameters can be trained with data collected from experiments or available data archives. This model, along with its pre-trained weights, can be used for the prediction of another building if partially retrained with the new data from this target building only on the first few layers. This method could potentially eliminate most repetitive human labor on tasks such as building information collection, populating information into the physics-based model, and the calibration of the physics-based model. However, the transfer learning method comes with its limitations. Despite its adaptation to different climates, building geometries, thermal characteristics, and system sizes, the efficiency of transfer learning with deep neural networks declines if the operations are in entirely different categories; for example, if the source building has a time-based schedule, and the target building has an occupancy-triggered schedule. In such scenarios, the pre-trained neural network could not generalize well. Therefore, it is helpful to create and curate a database for pre-trained source building templates with different operational strategies. Furthermore, the performance of this transfer learning deep neural network model will keep improving over time while more operational data are streaming into the model. By contrast, the performance of the physics-based model is static: if there is a gap between the simulation and real operation, this gap will not be closed automatically and will remain there with high probability. It will lead to suboptimal building performance on energy consumption and thermal comfort if the control system uses that simulation as the basis for predictive control. As a data-driven model, the transfer learning with a deep neural network has its limitations with regard to interpretability. In the case when model interpretability is important and a clear causal relationship is essential, the physics-based model would be a better fit for that task. However, to facilitate predictive control, the method of using transfer learning with a deep neural network offers greater advantages for fulfilling the task.

        "dc:description": "Advanced control strategies are central components of smart buildings. For model-based control algorithms, the quality of the model that represents building systems and dynamics is essential to guarantee satisfactory performance of smart building control and automation. For the model predictive control of the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems in buildings coupled with natural ventilation, a high-fidelity model is necessary to reliably predict the thermal responses of the building under various environmental and operational conditions. This task can be accomplished by using a deep neural network, which can capture the dynamics of complicated physical processes, such as natural ventilation. Training a deep neural network requires the collection of a large amount of data; however, in practice, the target building may not have enough operational data available. This study demonstrates how transfer learning could help with this dilemma. By freezing most layers of a deep neural network model with 42,902 parameters that are pre-trained on multi-year data from a source room in Beijing, the model can be re-trained with only 200 trainable parameters on only 15 days of data from the target room in Shanghai that has entirely different floor area, building material, and window size. The proposed transfer learning model achieves high accuracy predicting both indoor air temperature and relative humidity for a time horizon from 10 minutes to 2 hours, showing the mean squared error almost one magnitude smaller than the comparison model that is only trained on source data or target data. This methodology can be applied to the design of the control system in a new building which reduces the required amount of data for the training of the model, thus saving costs in control system design and commissioning.",
