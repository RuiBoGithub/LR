School of Environmental Science and Engineering Tianjin University Tianjin 300072 China Buildings and heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems are appropriate resources for demand response, but there is still a lack of rapid quantification methods to reveal buildings\u2019 dynamic demand response potential under different meteorological conditions and control strategies. In order to achieve real-time power grid dispatch and to facilitate grid-building interaction, this paper proposes a framework for establishing models to rapidly quantify the demand response potential of resources. First, a detailed co-simulation model of the building and its energy system is constructed, followed by extensive stochastic simulations of two commonly used demand response strategies, after which the demand response potential is quantified using a set of indices. Then, feature selection is performed on factors that may affect demand response potential, and a data-driven model for quantifying demand response potential is proposed, whose results are compared with those from the simulation model. Also, the demand response effects of the two control strategies are compared in this paper. A case study was carried out in an industrial building in Shenzhen, China. The results showed that under different boundaries, the coefficient of determination ( R 2 ) of the quantification indices are all above 0.9, and that the data-driven model rapidly and accurately captured the demand response potential of the building and its heating, ventilation and air-conditioning system, and was easy to deploy in practice. Keywords Demand response potential Flexibility Data-driven model Modelica Building energy systems Data availability Post-processed data for building machine learning models, (Original data) 1 Introduction 1.1 Background and literature review As the population grows and industrialization accelerates, the peak electricity demand is increasing day by day. At the same time, with the strengthening global consensus on carbon reduction, the penetration of renewable energy in power generation will further increase. In 2030, China's installed power generation capacity of renewable energy will account for 40 %. The increase in peak demand and the renewable energy penetration further brings challenges to stabilize the power grid [1]. As a result, while the infrastructure investment on the power supply side is high, changes on the demand side are more urgent to be made, which is conducive to reducing power generation capacity, avoiding congestion on the transmission and distribution network, and saving costs. Therefore, the flexibility at the energy demand side is receiving more and more attention [2,3]. Building energy consumption accounts for one-third of global energy consumption, while heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems consume more than 50 % of the building energy [4,5]. Building load can be reduced by passive thermal storage or HVAC system regulation without doing much harm to the thermal comfort, as a result, buildings can be taken as good flexibility resources [6,7].In the IEA report, it is pointed out that in 2018, the building demand response potential (DRP) reached 3071TWh, accounting for 77.4 % of the total value, and by 2050, the available flexible resources of the residential, commercial, and industrial sectors will be ten times more than they were in 2019. However, the report also illustrated that less than 2 % of the current DRP was efficiently utilized in 2019 [8].To improve this, it is necessary to identify the available demand response (DR) resources in the building and their ability to provide services to the grid, to achieve real-time power grid dispatch [9]. Therefore, how to rapidly quantify the DRP of the building has become an urgent problem at present. Related works in 5 years are listed in Table 1 . The first step for quantifying DRP is to determine indices that cater to the needs of the power grid. One way is to use differential electrical power before and after the DR to represent the flexibility of different resources. However, a single index sometimes fails to reveal the difference among various regulating measures [6,10]. Refs. [11\u201313] proposed a set of indices including power shifting capability, available storage capacity, thermal storage loss, and thermal storage efficiency during the DR event, and energy loss during the DR recovery stage. They also proposed a general flexibility quantification framework that is applicable to systems with multiple flexibility resources and intends to describe the capacity of flexibility resources and their utilization efficiency. In Refs. [14\u201316], indices such as response time, recovery time, and ramp rate were further considered, because of the different dynamic characteristics of different types of resources. For example, chillers can respond within a few minutes [17], fans usually complete load shedding within 15 min [18,19], lighting response time is 30 ∼ 40 s, and pre-cooling of the building thermal mass and utilization of energy storage require several hours in advance [20,21]. In other words, in addition to the capacity of flexibility resources, the response speed also needs to be considered. In Refs. [22,23], a more detailed set of indices was used to describe the DR process, including the time, power, and capacity in each phase. Compared to the aforementioned studies, indices in [22,23] can directly interact with the grid and is more similar to the grid flexibility indices, and the efficiency and capacity of the flexibility resources on the demand side are less concerned [24]. It can be seen that, in order to meet the needs of power dispatching, the DRP of each flexible resource needs to be characterized by multiple indices. After selecting an appropriate set of indices, it is also necessary to consider how to obtain the potential of these resources, and how to quickly quantify the potential when the dispatched command is given by the grid. Methods used in the existing research on building flexibility quantification include field experiments, simulation-based and data-driven methods. Li et al. [25] reduced the peak power consumption by 16.74 % through equipment on\u2013off control. When the thermal inertia of the air conditioning system was considered, the power was further reduced by 1.93 % by adjusting the chilled water temperature. Field experiments can reflect the real DRP of various resources in buildings. Still, it is difficult to quantify the flexibility of the building under all working conditions, and to explore the general rules, due to large human and time costs. So far, most of the research is still based on simulation: establishing system models through simulation software such as EnergyPlus[26], TRNSYS[27], Dymola/Modelica[28], etc., or using reduced-order models (RC), to simulate the thermal dynamics of buildings and implement various DR strategies. Chen et al.[10] explored the DRP of different resources in the building, and the results showed that the DRP of the building thermal mass accounted for more than 70 %. Finck et al.[11] studied the influence of thermal energy storage (TES) on the DRP of the system through the optimal control of the TES charge/discharge rate. The results showed that with TES the flexibility of the system was greatly improved, and the DR services were provided during different stages. Arteconi et al.[15] studied the influence of climate, and the thermal inertia of building thermal mass and HVAC on DRP, and did sensitivity analysis; the results also showed that systems with high thermal inertia had a positive effect on enhancing DRP. Yin et al. [29] determined the optimal pre-cooling strategy based on the calibrated simulation model, and by adjusting the indoor temperature setpoint, it was shown in field tests that the peak power demand was reduced by 15\u201330 %. Furthermore, advanced control strategies such as Model Predictive Control (MPC) were employed in some studies to extract the maximum available DRP, especially in systems with energy storage devices, which can capture the temporal DRP changes of buildings through optimal scheduling[11,30,31]. Amadeh et al.[32] further considered the impact of model uncertainty and weather forecast uncertainty[33] on DRP quantification within the MPC framework. However, this requires MPC to be applied in practice to reach its full potential, while MPC has not yet been commonly used in the field; and meanwhile, time for calculation is not easy to control. A few studies further incorporated data-driven approaches, where simulation models were used to test algorithms or expand datasets. Luo et al.[34] constructed a Bayesian network to extract the DRP of HVAC, lighting, and plug loads from the simulation results. Yu et al.[35] estimated the DRP on an urban scale based on the historical data acquired from previous DR events of buildings, using building characteristics and DR information, etc. as features through the XGboost model. The benefit of data-driven approaches is that data-driven models can learn from the quantification results of simulation models, thereby speeding up computations by replacing white-box models. In addition, it\u2019s easier to embed less complicated computational procedures in practical systems. To conclude, there are still issues that have not been stressed in related works: first, in some cases, the DRP is gained in static external boundaries or fixed DR durations, where it\u2019s impossible to quantify DRP at any given time; additionally, physical simulation modeling is still the most commonly used method for DRP quantification, which is faced with burden in computation and limitation in the platform; furthermore, some indices are not sufficient to reveal the features of DR resources, while some are not entirely geared to the grid operators. 2 Research targets To solve the above issues and facilitate the interaction between buildings and the grids, a framework is proposed to establish data-driven models to quantify DRP rapidly. The data-driven model can reflect the DRP by multiple indices under different operation conditions and DR strategies. Also, the input variables for the data-driven model are accessible from the measured data of most building energy management systems (BEMS). Compared to simulation models, it is faster in computation speed, easier to be integrated into BEMS, and can be used in real-time power grid dispatch. This paper is organized as below: in section 2, the overall technical framework for generating a rapid DRP quantification model is described. In section 2.1, the simulation tools and methods to generate DR data are introduced; section 2.2 illustrates the process of generating training data set, and describes the DR scenarios used for quantification and their corresponding evaluation indices; section 2.3 describes the process of establishing a data-driven model using a simulation model. In section 3, the feasibility of the above method is verified through a case study, and the results of the feature selection and DRP estimation model in different scenarios are given. At the end of section 3, the generalization ability of the estimation model is verified by simulating scenarios outside of the training set. Section 4 is the conclusion part, and the limitations of the research are also pointed out. 3 Method This paper proposes a method for rapidly quantifying the DRP of building air-conditioning systems. The outline of the method is shown in Fig. 1 . It is difficult to obtain a DR dataset under all working conditions in practice. For this reason, this paper firstly builds a twin model of the actual system to generate DR data under rich working conditions and to reflect the dynamic characteristics of each part of the actual system in detail through co-simulation. Moreover, as mentioned in section 1, there\u2019re various DR strategies for air-conditioning systems; thus, the DRP quantification method in this paper is intended to be applicable to different strategies. As an example, the DRP of two commonly used DR strategies (indoor temperature setpoint resetting and equipment on\u2013off control) are quantified in this paper under abundant scenarios of different climate and working conditions, as shown in Step 2. In Step 3, a rapid DRP quantification model is built for the above two strategies via a data-driven approach. To improve the accuracy of quantification, feature selection and determination of hyper-parameters for data-driven models are required, which is briefly described in section 2.3. In the last step, to further verify the generalization ability of the DRP quantification model, random simulation was employed to obtain verification data, and the estimation accuracy of the model was validated. 3.1 System modeling It is difficult to obtain sufficient training datasets in actual systems. Therefore, a simulation model of the physical system was established to generate DR data under different operating conditions and different regulating measures. This paper took the building\u2019s air-conditioning system as the research object. The flexibility is affected by two parts: the thermal inertia of the building, and the coupling dynamic characteristics of the thermal, hydraulic and control system of the HVAC[37]. However, a single simulation tool is not able to reflect the dynamics of both thermal mass and HVAC in detail at the same time, which can be complemented by co-simulation[38]. EnergyPlus is widely used in building load simulation, and in this paper, it was applied to simulate the building envelope, as shown in Fig. 2 , where parameters in black represent inputs, and those in red represent interactive variables of the co-simulation. Scenarios with different loads and those with random internal disturbance were generated respectively by typical annual meteorological data and Monte Carlo simulation. It was assumed that in this case, an industrial building, the internal disturbance was relatively stable, whose schedule was generated by the superposition of three random signals: firstly, a benchmark of random internal disturbance ranging from 0.4 ∼ 1(per day) to describe the impact of the number of factory orders; and then two noise values with sampling time of 1 h and 10 min respectively ranging −0.2 ∼ 0.2 and −0.05 ∼ 0.05 to express the short-term fluctuation of the internal disturbance. The schedule was generated through the Advanced Noise library[39]. EnergyPlus can accurately simulate the thermal dynamic characteristics of buildings, but its modeling ability for HVAC systems is limited, and its control system model is often ideal, and with a fixed simulation step size through which the short-time dynamic features cannot be captured[40]. Thus, an equation-based and object-oriented language Modelica that can couple thermal, hydraulic, and control systems with variable step size [41] was employed. The advantages of Modelica for HVAC simulation are explained in detail in the literature [42,43]. The Buildings library [44] was used to build the component model of the energy and control system, and the State graph library [45] was used to model the discrete control sequences like on\u2013off control of the equipment. A primary pump constant flow system was constructed, as shown in Fig. 3 , including two chillers (one of which as a back-up unit), as well as two pumps and two cooling towers; the terminal is a primary air fan-coil system. The frequency of chillers was controlled by the chilled water outlet temperature, while the water pumps and cooling towers were operated at a fixed frequency; the opening ratio of the bypass valve was controlled by the differential pressure of the main pipe supply and return water; the opening ratio of the water valve of the fan coil was controlled by the air supply temperature; the speed of fans was controlled by the indoor temperature which was to be maintained at 25 °C. The model paths are shown in Table 2 . Since the building and HVAC system were modeled on different simulation platforms, Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI)[50] was used to couple the two. The sensible and latent heat of the building was calculated by Modelica, and exported to EnergyPlus where the building indoor average temperature and humidity were calculated. The communication step of the co-simulation was 60 s[38]. The system model in Modelica is shown in Fig. 4 . 3.2 DR control strategies and evaluation indices DR potential of the system under different conditions can be obtained via extensive simulations based on various control strategies. In this paper, results of simulations without DR were defined as the benchmark, and two commonly used DR strategies were selected, which are simple enough to be executed by the BEMS of many buildings in practice. In this section, the indices and the datasets generation process are described, aiming to generate a sufficient training dataset for the rapid DRP quantification model. 3.2.1 DR strategies \u2022 Global Temperature Adjusting (Strategy A)[18,51]: raising the indoor temperature setpoint ( T indoor , s p ) of all fan coils at the beginning of DR, to reduce cooling load and thus reduce system power. The fluctuation of indoor temperature and power of the HVAC system during the DR are shown in Fig. 5 : Stage 1:at the beginning of DR, due to the increase of the indoor temperature setpoint, the load of fans falls quickly within 5 ∼ 20 min, causing the part load ratio of chillers to drop rapidly, and the maximum power shedding is thus obtained. Stage 2:as the indoor temperature continuously increases during the DR, and the speed of fans gradually increases to maintain the indoor temperature at the new setpoint. During this stage, the power of the system is relatively stable but still lower than that in the benchmark case. Stage 3:when DR is terminated, and indoor temperature setpoint is restored to its original value, the speed of fans climbs, causing a rebound of power till the indoor temperature drops to the setpoint. \u2022 Shut Down Chiller Plant Equipment (strategy B)[17,52]: turning off all equipment in the chiller plant (including chillers, chilled water pumps, cooling water pumps and cooling towers) at the beginning of DR, while the air conditioning terminal equipment still keeps running. The fluctuation of indoor temperature and power of the HVAC system during the DR are shown in Fig. 6 : Stage 1:At the beginning of DR, devices of HVAC are shut down sequentially within a few minutes according to the preset control sequence, and then the power of the system falls discretely, after which the maximum power shedding is reached. Due to the shortage of cooling supply, the indoor temperature starts to rise after a short delay, and consequently the speed of fans increases rapidly to its maximum. Stage 2:As cooling demand cannot be satisfied, and the indoor temperature continuously rises up to its upper limit. Stage3:DR is forced to terminate because of the indoor temperature limit, and all devices are turned on. At this moment an intensive power rebound occurs due to high cooling demand and high return chilled water temperature, until the indoor temperature becomes relatively stable. To be clear: first, for strategy A, the load shedding speed of fans is related to the difference of indoor temperature and its setpoint; for strategy B, the load shedding speed is mainly linked to the on\u2013off control sequence of devices, and thus the duration from the beginning of DR to the maximum power shedding point is not quantified. Second, the duration of DR in strategy A is controllable, while that in strategy B is determined by the upper limit of the indoor temperature ( T indoor , l i m ), which means that when the indoor temperature reaches the upper limit, the DR process is forced to terminate, or else the temperature will continue to increase; as a result, the duration of DR in strategy A is taken as the input that affects DRP, and that in strategy B is the output of the quantification results. 3.2.2 DR evaluation indices In this paper, the dynamic indices were selected to quantify the DR process, from two perspectives: time and power [16],which are similar to the flexibility indices of the grid so that they can be directly used by the grid without any further conversion. Indices of the two strategies are respectively illustrated below and pointed out in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6. 4 Strategy A: \u2022 t mpr : duration from the beginning of DR to the maximum power shedding point (s); \u2022 Δ P drmax : maximum power shedding during the DR event (kW); \u2022 Δ P drmean : mean power shedding during the DR event (kW); (1) Δ P drmean = ∫ t drst t drend P base - P dr d t t drend - t drst \u2022 Δ P rebmax : maximum power rebound after the DR event(kW); 5 Strategy B: \u2022 t dr : maximum DR duration (s); \u2022 Δ P drmax : maximum power shedding during the DR event (kW); \u2022 Δ P drmean : mean power shedding during the DR event (kW), described as in equation (1)； \u2022 Δ P rebmax : maximum power rebound after the DR event (kW); 5.0.1 DR dataset generation Abundant dataset was generated according to the simulation model and DR strategies described above to train the date-driven model. Parameters of DR strategies are shown in Table 3 ; the simulation was carried out for 120 days in total from May to September, and DR was performed once a day from 10:00 to 17:00 during which period most of the peak power demand occurred. In strategy A, the duration of DR was set to be 1\u20133 h. Although DR under strategy A is able to last even longer, the duration in practice is usually shorter than 3 h [6,10]. In order to ensure the thermal comfort of occupants, the upper limit and setpoint of indoor temperature were set to 26 ∼ 28℃, at the interval of 0.5℃. 5.1 Establishment of DRP quantification models After obtaining the building\u2019s DRP under different conditions through physical model simulation, a surrogate model that can approximate the DRP quantified by physical model was established to reduce the computational burden and make the model more applicable in practice. In many studies, the surrogate model is a date-driven model[53], and in this section, methods for establishing data-driven models to rapidly quantify DRP is introduced: firstly, a machine learning model was defined, then input variables that may affect the model were manually selected, based on which feature engineering and hyper-parameters optimization were performed to obtain optimum DRP quantification model. 5.2 The machine learning model The machine learning model constructed in this paper is to rapidly obtain the flexibility of buildings quantified by indices in section 2.2.2 under certain boundary conditions and DR control strategies. The quantification results were the targets of machine learning, and to obtain the most suitable features and the most accurate results, data-driven models were established for each one of the indices. Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) is a commonly used supervised machine learning method, which uses multiple neurons in multiple layers to mimic the human brain, and it has been pointed out[54,55] that MLP can be used to model and control buildings and their energy systems, and can accurately approximate the nonlinear system dynamics. It has one input layer, one or more hidden layers (HL), and one output layer, and it\u2019s a simple feed-forward network whose output signal is completely calculated based on the current input signal. In this paper, an MLP network model with 2 hidden layers was constructed, the l-BFGS algorithm was used to train the model[56],and the mean absolute error (MAE) was employed as the scoring criterion of the model, as shown in formula (2). (2) MAE = 1 m ∑ i = 1 m y i - y ^ i where y i and y ^ i represent the simulation results and estimated results, respectively, and m is the number of data samples. 5.3 Feature variables to be selected Before feature selection, the variable to be selected must be determined, which in this paper was based on prior knowledge, and the principles are as follows: \u2022 Taking into account the thermal inertia of the building, the time dimension, 3 h before and after DR at the interval of 1 h is selected; \u2022 Feature variables should be measurable in most buildings to make the model easier to use in practice. If variables need to be predicted, their acquisition should not be too complex. Feature variables to be selected are shown in Table 4 , there were 20 variables for strategy A and 19 for strategy. Among the variables in the table, the cooling load ( CL ) was calculated from the differential temperature and flow rate of the supply and return chilled water which are easy to obtain with sensors in the building, and also, load prediction algorithms based on these variables are also mature; outdoor temperature ( T odb ) and relative humidity ( RH ) were obtained directly through meteorological platforms. Other variables such as internal disturbances, system internal state, and irradiance were not selected, either because the state estimation is required for these variables, or because sensors for monitoring such variables are expensive and unavailable in most buildings. 5.4 Feature engineering and hyper-parameters tuning In this section, all the data described in 2.2.3 will be used, the process of selecting the most reasonable features and hyper-parameters for the above MLP is introduced, as shown in Fig. 7 , to improve the accuracy of DRP quantification. Commonly used feature selection methods include: filtering, wrapping, and embedding[57]. Among these methods, the filtering method has the advantage of fast calculation, but it is only performed from the data level, and the selection result is independent of the model and is uncertain [53]; the selection result of the embedding method is affected by the parameters of the machine learning model itself. The threshold of both the filtering and embedding method needs to be determined subjectively. The wrapping method, on the contrary, is tailored for the model, through which better selection results can be obtained. However, due to the need to traverse the feature sets, the computation requirements are higher than the first two methods, especially when the amount of data and features are large. The number of feature variables selected in this paper was less than 20, and the calculation burden of the wrapping method and cross-validation[58] was within an acceptable range. Sequential Feature Selection (SFS) is commonly used in the wrapping method, which is a greedy process that starts with an empty set and fills it with selected optimal new features based on the cross-validation score in each iteration, and this process is repeated until the desired number of selected features is reached[57]. Since this method is model-based, if MLP is used as the benchmark model, the computation time will be long, and the hyperparameters will not be determined. Consequently, in this paper a compromise method that built a two-layer loop was employed to obtain the most suitable features and models. First, the LassoCV model[59] was used to rapidly and recursively preselect features even if it was different from the MLP model, and then the model was trained based on the selected features, and the MLP hyperparameters were tuned. The detailed process is as follows: \u2022 Date-preprocessing: features were standardized by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance. \u2022 In loop A, LassoCV was used as an estimator to select the optimum feature among i features by recursing forward, and meanwhile, 10 folds cross-validation (cv = 10) was performed to improve the generalization ability. \u2022 In loop B, i variables with the highest score were used as the input of the model, and the MLP model was initialized, and then the Bayesian algorithm was used to optimize the number of neurons in each layer (maximum 50 neurons per layer), and 10 folds cross-validation was also performed. \u2022 The loop was ended until i was equal to the number of variables in the feature set, and the scores under different features were output. 5.5 Toolchain In this paper, Dymola was used as the solver and compiler of Modelica, and EnergyPlus was used for modeling the building, and the two were coupled through FMI. Python was used for batch simulations to generate training datasets. Scikit-learn[60] was used for feature extraction and neural network model training. Bayesian optimization algorithm in scikit-optimize[61] was used for hyper-parameter tuning. 6 Case study and results 6.1 Case introduction This paper took an industrial building in Shenzhen as the object to verify the proposed method. The building is used for lithium-ion battery production and is a light material building with an area of 22,000 square meters, as shown in Fig. 2. Due to the subtropical climate and heat produced indoors from production machines, cooling is required almost throughout the year. The HVAC system is equipped with two centrifugal chillers of different capacities, of which the smaller one is a backup unit. Model parameters and equipment information are shown in Table 5 . The dry- and wet-bulb temperature of the typical year in Shenzhen are shown in Fig. 8 . To generate more operating conditions, the method mentioned in Section 2.1 was used to randomly generate the schedule of internal disturbance in EnergyPlus. The results of one week schedule are shown in Fig. 9 . Co-simulation was performed on the system model without DR, and the simulated daily cooling load is shown in Fig. 10 . 6.2 Results of DRP quantification First, the simulation results of the two DR strategies are displayed. Results of strategy A are shown in Fig. 11 . Fig. 11. (a)-(d) respectively shows the maximum power shedding, the mean power shedding, the maximum power rebound, and duration from the beginning of DR to the maximum power shedding point ( t mpr ) of the system under different DR start time and indoor temperature setpoints. It can be seen from Fig. 11. (a) that the indoor temperature setpoint and the maximum power shedding were strongly positively related. Also, the maximum power shedding was less than 100 kW when the upper limit of indoor temperature was 26 °C, and it reached 350 kW when the upper limit was 28 °C, and the maximum power shedding was mostly distributed between 120 and 250 kW. Judging from the medians of Fig. 11. (a) and (b), the mean power shedding was less than half of the maximum power shedding. Moreover, it could be noticed from Fig. 11. (c) that the higher the indoor temperature setpoint, the greater the power rebound was, and it reached up to 700 kW; also, the rebound was relatively smaller as DR started later. In addition, as shown in Figure (d), t mpr distributed discretely. When the temperature difference between the setpoint and the current value was larger, t mpr became shorter, which is to say, even with the same temperature setpoint, t mpr is affected by other factors. Even when the temperature difference was small, it took nearly 25 min to reach the maximum power shedding point. Fig. 12 illustrates the violin-plot of maximum DR duration and upper limit of indoor temperature under strategy B, and it\u2019s obvious that the two were correlated, with the duration from 600 s to 1 h. When the upper limit of indoor temperature was 26 °C, the duration of DR was mostly less than 1000 s. Furthermore, the increase of the median of duration along with the increase of upper temperature limit was almost linear, and when the temperature limit grew from 26 to 28 °C, the duration nearly doubled. In Fig. 13 , the correlation between the quantification indices and the maximum DR duration under strategy B is further shown. The colors of the scatter points represent the upper limit of indoor temperature, and the sizes of points denote the start time of DR. it can be seen that the maximum power shedding decreased from 500 to 300 kW along with the increase of DR duration, while the mean power shedding and maximum power rebound displayed reverse trend, ranging 225\u2013400 kW and 500\u2013850 kW respectively. Additionally, the mean power shedding increased with the increase of upper limit of indoor temperature; and the impact of temperature limits on maximum power rebound were also revealed: the rebound power increased from about 500 to 600 kW when the temperature limit increased from 26 to 28 °C. Therefore, the DR potential changes dynamically under different adjusting intervals and different boundaries. 6.3 Feature selection and model estimation results This section illustrates the results of feature selection. As mentioned above, to ensure the accuracy of the model, feature selection was performed on each model of quantification indices, and the features were sorted according to their importance to the building's DRP. The principle of determining the number of features was to build an estimation model with fewer features without affecting the accuracy, so as to simplify the structure and enhance the applicability of the model. The number of selected features and the optimal hyper-parameters of the model are shown in Fig. 14 and Fig. 15 , where pink and blue bars represent the number of neurons in the first and the second layer, respectively. The purple curve represents the model scores under different number of features, and the yellow triangle represents the number of features selected. It can be seen that the scores tended to be stable after several key features had been added, and the number of these key features was less than 1/3 of the total. The variables of the selected features and their ranking according to their importance are further shown in Table 6 and Table 7 . In strategy A, the indoor temperature setpoint was an important feature, which ranked high in all models, and this was consistent with the above simulated results; the duration of DR only affected the mean power shedding; the cooling load 1 h before the DR had a significant impact on the t mpr ; for the model that quantified the maximum power rebound, the load 3 h after the DR was more of significance. Similarly, in strategy B, the indoor temperature setpoint also ranked high; it is worth noting that the maximum power shedding was approximately equal to the power of the HVAC system at the beginning of DR, which was directly related to the cooling load at the start of DR, but the addition of extra features still further improved the model accuracy. A correlation between maximum power shedding and the duration of DR is shown in Fig. 13, but the duration was not selected as a feature of the maximum power shedding model, while in the model that quantified the maximum power rebound, the DR duration was selected as the input feature, which means that the input of the maximum power rebound model was depend on the output of the DR duration model. In general, through the process described in Section 2.3.3, the appropriate input features were determined for each index model, and the influencing factors for the DRP were mined at the same time. However, it was found that in some optimization processes the number of neurons reached the upper limit and needed to be increased for convergent results, while in some cases the number of neurons in the second layer was 1, indicating that these hidden layers were not needed. The neural network model was trained according to the feature selection results, and the results were evaluated using the coefficient of determination ( R 2 ), as shown in formula (3), where y ¯ is the average of the simulation results. As shown in Fig. 16 and Fig. 17 , thanks to abundant training samples, hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation, both strategies were relatively accurate with R 2 above 0.9, which proved that the data-driven model was able to reveal the dynamics of DRP under different scenarios. However, there were still a few points in strategy A that could not reflect the real quantification results; and the maximum error of the maximum power shedding and that of the maximum power rebound both reached 70 kW. (3) R 2 = 1 - ∑ i = 1 m y - y ^ 2 ∑ i = 1 m y - y ¯ 2 7 Discussion In Fig. 18 , the distribution of indices under the two strategies is further shown. Strategy B reduced more power during DR, whose median of the maximum power shedding was twice that of strategy A, while the mean power shedding was three times that of strategy A. In addition, it can be seen that the maximum power shedding and the mean power shedding during DR were different. For strategy A, the system power gradually recovered after reaching the minimum point, which coincided with Fig. 5, that is, the speed of fans increased to maintain the new setpoint; also, for strategy B, the speed of fans continued to rise to its maximum value due to the shortage of cooling supply. That is to say, for both strategies, the maximum power shedding didn\u2019t last long, therefore, the mean power shedding is more suitable to describe the entire DR process. In addition, in strategy B, the cooling supply was completely cut off, resulting in greater power rebound, while strategy A was more moderate with less impact on the system. Different control strategies need to be applied when faced with different DR processes. Strategy B is more suitable for emergency response with faster response speed and more power shedding, while strategy A is more suitable for DR requiring longer duration. Last but not least, since all the training data are used to establish the surrogate model, in order to verify the generalization ability of the model, more working conditions needed to be simulated. The values of the parameters were the same as those in Table 3, but the difference was that random sampling was performed on temporal and temperature variables respectively at intervals of 600 s and 0.1 °C, and 120 groups were selected under each DR strategy to simulate variable DR start time and parameters. The trained model was re-simulated for estimation, the results are shown in Fig. 19 , with R 2 still above 0.9. 8 Conclusion In this paper, a framework was proposed for constructing a model to rapidly quantify demand response potential of buildings and their heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems. A co-simulation platform of EnergyPlus and Modelica was established to simulate the system dynamics when a demand response event occurs, and the potential of two commonly used demand response strategies were quantified via a set of indices from both time and power perspectives. Afterward, a large number of stochastic simulations were carried out to generate the training dataset, and the Multi-layer Perceptron was used to establish the relationship between the demand response potential and the different boundary conditions. Finally, feature engineering and hyper-parameter tuning are used to tailor the model for each quantification index to obtain the highest accuracy. The primary conclusions of the study as follows: 1. Demand response potential was quantified by multiple indices under different control strategies. Compared to global temperature adjusting, shutting down the equipment led to greater power shedding, with shorter durations and more power rebound. At the same time, these indices\u2019 values vary under different meteorological boundaries, cooling loads, and control parameters. Therefore, users needed to consider the impact of these factors to meet various demand response programs. 2. The data-driven model was able to replace the physical simulation model to accurately quantify the demand response potential with good generalization capability. When global temperature adjustment was applied, the coefficients of determination in training and validation were above 0.94 and 0.92, respectively; and when shutting down the equipment, that in training and validation were above 0.98 and 0.96, respectively. 3. The computation of Multi-layer Perceptron was faster than physical simulation models, thus facilitating real-time interaction between the building and the power grid. Future work will include further evaluation of demand response potential for different building types and combinations of multiple strategies, in addition to examining the impact of load forecast errors on the accuracy of demand response potential quantification, and capturing the demand response potential of buildings with fewer data.

        "dc:description": "Buildings and heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems are appropriate resources for demand response, but there is still a lack of rapid quantification methods to reveal buildings\u2019 dynamic demand response potential under different meteorological conditions and control strategies. In order to achieve real-time power grid dispatch and to facilitate grid-building interaction, this paper proposes a framework for establishing models to rapidly quantify the demand response potential of resources. First, a detailed co-simulation model of the building and its energy system is constructed, followed by extensive stochastic simulations of two commonly used demand response strategies, after which the demand response potential is quantified using a set of indices. Then, feature selection is performed on factors that may affect demand response potential, and a data-driven model for quantifying demand response potential is proposed, whose results are compared with those from the simulation model. Also, the demand response effects of the two control strategies are compared in this paper. A case study was carried out in an industrial building in Shenzhen, China. The results showed that under different boundaries, the coefficient of determination ( R 2 ) of the quantification indices are all above 0.9, and that the data-driven model rapidly and accurately captured the demand response potential of the building and its heating, ventilation and air-conditioning system, and was easy to deploy in practice.",
